<v Speaker 3>Believe it or not,</v>

103
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the way you feel is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical.</v>

104
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.750
<v Speaker 3>And of course a lot of it is that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are depressed because their livestocks </v>

105
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.750
<v Speaker 3>let's be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of us are wage slaves.</v>

106

<v Speaker 3>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>

107
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think taking pills while </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going on,</v>

108
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 3>just to try to trick yourself into </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking that everything's groovy.</v>

109
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a really big believer in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

110
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm much more of a proponent of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

111
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 3>get your fucking life in order and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>be amazed at how much better you feel.</v>

112
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.820
<v Speaker 3>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never had a problem with the </v>

113
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.820
<v Speaker 3>balance of my mind and I know people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

114
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 3>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't ever say that you shouldn't take</v>

115
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:55.420
<v Speaker 3>this or you should take that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's fucking completely different</v>

116
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 3>and it's preposterous to think that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

117
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 3>the inner workings of another man's mind</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's a normal part of my diet.</v>

121

179
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.230
<v Speaker 3>They were so upset with Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

180
00:07:56.231 --> 00:07:58.900
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to get in a boat and go</v>

<v Speaker 3>to someplace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

182
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:05.290
<v Speaker 3>we're not even looking at it really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>truly and perspective because here's </v>

183
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.100
<v Speaker 3>something that was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really rare back then.</v>

184
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:11.260
<v Speaker 3>Any one on one accounts of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>went there that liked it.</v>

185
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Forget about picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have pictures back then.</v>

186
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.200
<v Speaker 3>Would you see some drawings?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

187
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.240
<v Speaker 3>you didn't even talk to one guy probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>that went over there himself and had a </v>

188
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 3>wonderful and prosperous life and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me,</v>

189
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:26.590
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's land to be had.</v>

190
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:28.150
<v Speaker 3>It's a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

191
00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:33.151
<v Speaker 3>Over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a great mass of movement of humans </v>

192
00:08:33.641 --> 00:08:35.080
<v Speaker 3>in such a short period of time.</v>

193
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.860
<v Speaker 3>The population or the population of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>North American continent,</v>

194
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that there was already a small </v>

195
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.951
<v Speaker 3>group of nomadic people that were living</v>
<v Speaker 3>here and they were just completely </v>

196
00:08:46.951 --> 00:08:48.100
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed by the volume and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>

197
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.580
<v Speaker 3>I think there are a lot of them in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in North America.</v>

198
00:08:51.581 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a lot of native </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans and indigenous people.</v>

199
00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.870
<v Speaker 3>When you say a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was there like millions?</v>

200
00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

201
00:08:58.930 --> 00:08:59.580
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me say,</v>

202
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.610
<v Speaker 3>let me say even if there was a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's nothing in comparison to what it </v>

203
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.610
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like right now like this,</v>

204
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 3>there's never been population numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this anywhere,</v>

205
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:07.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where the,</v>

206
00:09:07.961 --> 00:09:08.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

207
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Has there ever been a place where there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was virtually no one and an immigrants </v>

208
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.570
<v Speaker 3>all came in and then within a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred years there's $300 million over?</v>

209
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

210
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:18.700
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>

211
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.750
<v Speaker 3>unless it was pre flood before the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>media or impact or something like that,</v>

212
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.390
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how many native Americans or </v>
<v Speaker 3>were before they were killed and </v>

213
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:29.390
<v Speaker 3>pushback back.</v>

214
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:34.070
<v Speaker 3>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that must have been unbelievable for </v>

215
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.741
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that have lived their lives </v>

216
00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:36.741
<v Speaker 3>like a certain way before the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>white men came.</v>

217
00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must have been mostly been </v>

218
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 3>preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

219
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 3>they probably generation after </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation,</v>

220
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 3>they had followed the buffalo and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had lived this,</v>

221
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very disciplined in spiritual and sort </v>

222
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.271
<v Speaker 3>of in tune with nature and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and they had very clear laws</v>

223
00:09:53.341 --> 00:09:57.240
<v Speaker 3>of morality and how you deal with nature</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how you use up your resources.</v>

224
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could tell that they had a deep</v>

225
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:05.601
<v Speaker 3>reverence and a real understanding for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the resources of the environment and not</v>

226
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:10.671
<v Speaker 3>taking too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not wasting anything because you might </v>

227
00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:10.671
<v Speaker 3>not have it man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>

228
00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 3>they were under a real concern about </v>
<v Speaker 3>starving to death if they didn't get up </v>

229
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 3>in the morning and follow the buffalo </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they lost those motherfuckers.</v>

230
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.960
<v Speaker 3>If they have no food for a few weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what people use,</v>

231
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 3>your baby can die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

232
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:26.320
<v Speaker 3>You might just fuck up and run into a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

233
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:31.430
<v Speaker 3>time to seasons wrong and run into </v>
<v Speaker 3>someplace where you're stuck chasing </v>

234
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.460
<v Speaker 3>these buffalo in a place that gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>snowed in and there's no food.</v>

235
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:38.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to mention the fact that bears are </v>

236
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 3>eating you a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real worry for you.</v>

237
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're in the woods and </v>

238
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.360
<v Speaker 3>you fuck up and stumble upon its mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A mother and the cubs are getting there.</v>

239
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

240
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.300
<v Speaker 3>think about how aggressive people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>around their babies.</v>

241
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:56.301
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with a giant thousand </v>

242
00:10:56.301 --> 00:10:57.780
<v Speaker 3>pound fucking dog essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they go,</v>

243
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean dogs a dog with thick skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those things as such.</v>

244
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.960
<v Speaker 3>They did a scan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They bite themselves.</v>

245
00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:08.961
<v Speaker 3>They don't even hurt themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never seen them go to war with each </v>

246
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:08.961
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

247
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:12.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're taking chunks of hairs are </v>

248
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:12.960
<v Speaker 3>flying and shit like that and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

249
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 3>They're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just get the fuck out of each other.</v>

250
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.780
<v Speaker 3>Being each other's Claude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other's crap.</v>

251
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.960
<v Speaker 3>They literally would have dismembered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are weak and gelatinous like bodies was </v>

252
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:26.540
<v Speaker 3>just torn them apart like they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing just crunched through your </v>

253
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.141
<v Speaker 3>skull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a shit life it must have been back </v>

254
00:11:30.141 --> 00:11:33.531
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the American Indians on one hand </v>

255
00:11:33.531 --> 00:11:37.191
<v Speaker 3>you can say there was a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>satisfaction in that life and they </v>

256
00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:39.690
<v Speaker 3>probably were happier than the majority </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people today.</v>

257
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:44.900
<v Speaker 3>I think that's really arguable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just the majority of people </v>

258
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.991
<v Speaker 3>there for weak ass bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that today isn't way more </v>

259
00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:49.200
<v Speaker 3>awesome and people get confused in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes people go,</v>

260
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:54.201
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were happier back when they </v>

261
00:11:54.201 --> 00:11:54.201
<v Speaker 3>couldn't read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that people are happier?</v>

262
00:11:54.201 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 3>People</v>

263
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:59.220
<v Speaker 2>have your back when they just had grunts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody knew what they had to do </v>

264
00:11:59.220 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 2>to keep saying that doesn't mean back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then doesn't suck,</v>

265
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:04.441
<v Speaker 2>and today's an awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just means that today is so uber </v>

266
00:12:04.441 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 2>complex that a lot of people just don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even try.</v>

267
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.090
<v Speaker 2>They just go and do it and they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw it down on the ground and they run</v>

268
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:14.410
<v Speaker 2>away because there's no mechanism to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really take care of that back then.</v>

269
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:19.411
<v Speaker 2>If you throw yourself on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing this so fucking barrack </v>

270
00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:22.390
<v Speaker 2>eats you a bobcat would you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to kill you.</v>

271
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:27.391
<v Speaker 2>You'd starve to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can really get a lot of like </v>

272
00:12:27.391 --> 00:12:27.500
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like weepy.</v>

273
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 2>You can be really weepy and scared with </v>
<v Speaker 2>very little effect,</v>

274
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.890
<v Speaker 2>but the effect is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you say,</v>

275
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.400
<v Speaker 2>you still get an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

276
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.470
<v Speaker 2>the effect is for sure you never </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressed,</v>

277
00:12:37.471 --> 00:12:39.790
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting eaten outside your house.</v>

278
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.040
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

279
00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:41.860
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

280
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason why people develop character,</v>

281
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:50.401
<v Speaker 2>the reason why people develop </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences because there are </v>

282
00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:50.401
<v Speaker 2>consequences for not having those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

283
00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:51.910
<v Speaker 2>There's consequences for not having </v>
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>

284
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:56.911
<v Speaker 2>This confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's consequences for not having </v>

285
00:12:56.911 --> 00:12:59.161
<v Speaker 2>confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for not having control over your </v>

286
00:12:59.161 --> 00:12:59.161
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for not being a fucking man.</v>

287
00:12:59.161 --> 00:13:00.730
<v Speaker 2>There are consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what are they really?</v>

288
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:03.150
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty meager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some other guy fucks your girlfriend.</v>

289
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.530
<v Speaker 2>She leaves you for someone who's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

290
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:10.531
<v Speaker 2>You lose your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your metal box and you have to get an </v>

291
00:13:10.531 --> 00:13:10.531
<v Speaker 2>older metal box that someone has already</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived in.</v>

292
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.980
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

293
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.770
<v Speaker 2>They take your car away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a new car,</v>

294
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.000
<v Speaker 2>you have to move to a shitty apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

295
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:16.410
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

296
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:21.420
<v Speaker 2>What does it really happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cumulative effect of everything that </v>

297
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.130
<v Speaker 2>you're saying means that you're living </v>
<v Speaker 2>in hell when you're a bitch is what?</v>

298
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.240
<v Speaker 2>It's pointing out the garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is,</v>

299
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.150
<v Speaker 2>even with the shittier new car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

300
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less cool car,</v>

301
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:34.981
<v Speaker 2>the older car in this shitty apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still living a billion times </v>

302
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.460
<v Speaker 2>lever better than anybody did when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

303
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lewis and Clark would hitchhike in their</v>

304
00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 2>way across the fucking country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking no horses and shit.</v>

305
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know what the fuck was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

306
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 2>That was a ridiculous thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're living pretty,</v>

307
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.920
<v Speaker 2>pretty much everyone is living a life </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very similar to like Roman </v>

308
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.120
<v Speaker 2>mobility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got running water.</v>

309
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.090
<v Speaker 2>You can just go and turn the water on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a hot shower,</v>

310
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.520
<v Speaker 2>heats it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a brand new thing.</v>

311
00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:03.280
<v Speaker 2>You've got a microwave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can cook your food and two minutes.</v>

312
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen those new?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or there's new water heaters where it's </v>

313
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:08.350
<v Speaker 2>a constant flow of hot water.</v>

314
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:13.330
<v Speaker 2>It heats it instantly and you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have like giant tanks of water.</v>

315
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 2>The water goes through it and instantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>heats it up.</v>

316
00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:17.750
<v Speaker 2>So you could take a shower for an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half and it,</v>

317
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.350
<v Speaker 2>you'll never run out of hot water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

318
00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:22.150
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're living in paradise here.</v>

319
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.300
<v Speaker 2>You're not living back in the day when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to kill fleas on your </v>

320
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 2>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would put it over the toilet.</v>

321
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.250
<v Speaker 2>Did you know about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the castles and the castles.</v>

322
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.360
<v Speaker 2>If you got the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything was flea infested back </v>

323
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:39.360
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything was fleeing fast that there's</v>

324
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 2>fleas fucking everywhere because no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no way to clean,</v>

325
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:46.110
<v Speaker 2>no way to know poison for this Lisa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything swarming with fleas until </v>

326
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.620
<v Speaker 2>your clothes will get filled with fleas </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to get rid of the fleas and a </v>

327
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.201
<v Speaker 2>castle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would put the clothes over the </v>

328
00:14:53.201 --> 00:14:53.201
<v Speaker 2>shaft</v>

329
00:14:53.201 --> 00:14:57.340
<v Speaker 4>where the sewer sewer is because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ammonia would rise up through the </v>

330
00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.340
<v Speaker 4>clothes and kill the fleas and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>clothes.</v>

331
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the world you're living in.</v>

332
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.860
<v Speaker 4>You're washing your clothes and shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>fumes.</v>

333
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.360
<v Speaker 4>So they had to take those clothes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to all walk around smelling </v>

334
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.090
<v Speaker 4>fumes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's better than the fleas,</v>

335
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:12.500
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's better than the fleas.</v>

336
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:15.350
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather smell like old first one to </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure that out.</v>

337
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's gotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be a way to get these fucking.</v>

338
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.070

<v Speaker 3>That just kills me.</v>

340
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Let's try running through the frozen </v>
<v Speaker 3>river.</v>

341
00:15:25.471 --> 00:15:27.090
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.810
<v Speaker 4>human being?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could get burned at the stake if you</v>

349
00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:43.811
<v Speaker 4>took a shower more than twice a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you were taking like three or </v>

350
00:15:43.811 --> 00:15:45.170
<v Speaker 4>four showers a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people might get suspicious.</v>

351
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:46.550
<v Speaker 4>Like you should take a lot of shower.</v>

352
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.690
<v Speaker 3>Will they also be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is so clean?</v>

353
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.160
<v Speaker 3>Why do you smell that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which only witches smell good.</v>

354
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:57.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you like take a warm shower and </v>

355
00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.730
<v Speaker 3>then you climb into some like really </v>
<v Speaker 3>soft cotton clothes and you were like,</v>

356
00:15:58.731 --> 00:16:02.660
<v Speaker 3>you are feeling better than most humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>have ever felt in my whole life.</v>

357
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:07.690
<v Speaker 3>That's like a deeper sense of pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You plop down on your soft and </v>

358
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.260
<v Speaker 3>comfortable bed and for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

359
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:14.340
<v Speaker 3>look for a real reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not scared of getting eaten by </v>

360
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:14.340
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

361
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.240
<v Speaker 3>You're not scared of monsters or tribes </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming into town and rating your village</v>

362
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:20.810
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

363
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

364
00:16:22.641 --> 00:16:27.641
<v Speaker 3>You're just chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe sometimes you get colds and then </v>

365
00:16:27.641 --> 00:16:29.270
<v Speaker 3>you know you get a z pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hate your fucking fine.</v>

366
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sitting in front of a television </v>

367
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:34.720
<v Speaker 3>with the avatar playing say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're,</v>

368
00:16:34.721 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 3>you're sitting propped up on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>pillows and your wearing clean clothes.</v>

369
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:43.180
<v Speaker 3>You have it better than anyone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever lived ever by a long shot.</v>

370
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Did you imagine Lewis and Clark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could show those motherfuckers </v>

371
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.001
<v Speaker 3>the average 23 year old dude lives in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some shitty apartment is propped up on </v>

372
00:16:52.001 --> 00:16:53.160
<v Speaker 3>his bed watching TV in his bedroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes,</v>

373
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:58.180
<v Speaker 3>roommates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking loud and the other room with a </v>

374
00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:58.180
<v Speaker 3>blender like that guy's living in </v>
<v Speaker 3>paradise.</v>

375
00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:58.990
<v Speaker 3>He's like displays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

376
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.640
<v Speaker 3>Show us onto the mouths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You saw one mouse.</v>

377
00:17:01.641 --> 00:17:02.570
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

378
00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:07.571
<v Speaker 3>there's not everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Infesting all your clothes and eating </v>

379
00:17:07.571 --> 00:17:08.960
<v Speaker 3>your food and giving everyone horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>diseases.</v>

380
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.030
<v Speaker 3>That's killing everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Old.</v>

381
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.360
<v Speaker 3>Everyone with a weak immune system is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just fucking dead.</v>

382
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.480
<v Speaker 3>There's nowhere to put the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they stack them in the streets than </v>

383
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.361
<v Speaker 3>the rats get infested with it and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rat starts spreading it all over </v>

384
00:17:22.361 --> 00:17:22.580
<v Speaker 3>town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have the black plague.</v>

385
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

386
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:24.140
<v Speaker 3>you saw a mouse</v>

387
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.010
<v Speaker 4>who poor little booby won't be okay with</v>
<v Speaker 4>sharing the world with a mouse.</v>

388
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.980
<v Speaker 4>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also don't forget the fact that like</v>

389
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:34.990
<v Speaker 4>if you were pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a pretty good chance you're </v>

390
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.811
<v Speaker 4>going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most likely you're going to die when </v>

391
00:17:37.811 --> 00:17:40.781
<v Speaker 4>that thing comes out of your pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're just going to split you in </v>

392
00:17:40.781 --> 00:17:42.440
<v Speaker 4>half and there's no antibiotics in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The baby's probably going to die too.</v>

393
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:47.750
<v Speaker 3>During Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the infant mortality rate was 50 </v>

394
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.750
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty percent,</v>

395
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.340
<v Speaker 3>half the babies died and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things we.</v>

396
00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 3>You read about like crazy stories of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible.</v>

397
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:57.120
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about this before about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everything was so violent,</v>

398
00:17:57.121 --> 00:17:58.560
<v Speaker 3>so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people say,</v>

399
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:00.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is really a book of God,</v>

400
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:05.750
<v Speaker 3>the Book of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would it have such gratuitous </v>

401
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.750
<v Speaker 3>violence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would violence be condoned?</v>

402
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't even.</v>

403
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think we could wrap our </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands around how hard life was back when</v>

404
00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 3>they wrote the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

405
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.410
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the New Testament,</v>

406
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.670
<v Speaker 3>even with Constantine and the bishops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they reworked the New Testament,</v>

407
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.550
<v Speaker 3>that's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

408
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:27.450
<v Speaker 3>that's still ridiculously hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a terrible life back then,</v>

409
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:28.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

410
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:33.470
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they probably needed religion </v>

411
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.370
<v Speaker 3>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think about how,</v>

412
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.950
<v Speaker 3>how easy life is today and there's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people that need a safety net.</v>

413
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:42.780
<v Speaker 3>So many people that are terrified so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people that want one sanity to this</v>

414
00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:47.781
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they seek that Saturday and no really </v>

415
00:18:47.781 --> 00:18:48.970
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but back then it was imperative.</v>

416
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.950
<v Speaker 3>You had to have it.</v>

417
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.490
<v Speaker 4>I think Patton Oswald's got some </v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant joke about this where he talks</v>

418
00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:58.491
<v Speaker 4>about how religion was invented to trick</v>
<v Speaker 4>dumb people that there's a cake in.</v>

419
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 4>This guy says he stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like attacking everyone.</v>

420
00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:03.960
<v Speaker 4>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just really smart.</v>

421
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:08.961
<v Speaker 4>People recognize that there's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>dumb people that have no qualms in </v>

422
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:14.001
<v Speaker 4>killing and doing ridiculous things is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they tell them this fib to make </v>

423
00:19:14.001 --> 00:19:14.001
<v Speaker 4>them behave.</v>

424
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.230
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

425
00:19:15.231 --> 00:19:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

426
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:21.010
<v Speaker 3>It could be possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've always thought that what I </v>

427
00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.150
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always joke around about it being for </v>

428
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.681
<v Speaker 3>dumb people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's a pull towards the </v>

429
00:19:26.681 --> 00:19:28.350
<v Speaker 3>idea of something other than us and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think we always have had that too.</v>

430
00:19:28.351 --> 00:19:33.351
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're willing to believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're the end of the evolutionary </v>

431
00:19:33.351 --> 00:19:34.970
<v Speaker 3>food chain or the spiritual food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems silly.</v>

432
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.760
<v Speaker 3>It seems much more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's something above us.</v>

433
00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:42.761
<v Speaker 3>We just can't even communicate with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just the same way and can't tell </v>

434
00:19:42.761 --> 00:19:46.511
<v Speaker 3>you stories where we're not able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate with something that's the </v>

435
00:19:46.511 --> 00:19:47.450
<v Speaker 3>next,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next level of existence.</v>

436
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:48.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

437
00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:52.490
<v Speaker 4>especially when we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when we're so confused by our</v>

438
00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:54.590
<v Speaker 4>environment and we're saddened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>distracted.</v>

439
00:19:54.591 --> 00:19:59.591
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that you were talking about </v>

440
00:19:59.591 --> 00:19:59.591
<v Speaker 4>initially is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is something I read this,</v>

441
00:19:59.591 --> 00:20:03.611
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Dalai Lama was in beverly hills </v>

442
00:20:03.611 --> 00:20:06.401
<v Speaker 4>talking to like some rich people and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their house doing a home visit and he </v>

443
00:20:06.401 --> 00:20:07.790
<v Speaker 4>said to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

444
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.100
<v Speaker 4>here we are years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in Beverly Hills,</v>

445
00:20:10.101 --> 00:20:12.170
<v Speaker 4>you have your mansion and all your </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

446
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:17.350
<v Speaker 4>but why are your medicine cabinets </v>
<v Speaker 4>filled with antidepressants and volume </v>

447
00:20:18.381 --> 00:20:21.800
<v Speaker 4>and antianxiety medication?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even with all this stuff,</v>

448
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:27.010
<v Speaker 4>you're still experiencing mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>turbulence to the point where you're </v>

449
00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:27.590
<v Speaker 4>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the.</v>

450
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.080
<v Speaker 4>If people are still caught up in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>

451
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.200
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be very difficult for them</v>
<v Speaker 4>to to transcend it to a point where you </v>

452
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.190
<v Speaker 4>could communicate with some higher </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence.</v>

453
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:42.310
<v Speaker 4>How are you going to do that when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>caught up in some ridiculous perception </v>

454
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.260
<v Speaker 4>of the world where you're addicted and </v>
<v Speaker 4>attached to material things where you're</v>

455
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 4>stuck always wanting</v>

456
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.820
<v Speaker 3>some new thing which just makes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>perpetually insane.</v>

457
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:52.660
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

458
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:55.120
<v Speaker 3>that's for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that becomes their focus.</v>

459
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:57.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the human beings,</v>

460
00:20:57.131 --> 00:21:02.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can look at the shallowness of </v>

461
00:21:02.131 --> 00:21:02.131
<v Speaker 3>materialism and he could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

462
00:21:02.131 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 3>it's so shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

463
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:04.690
<v Speaker 3>it's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>

464
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 3>yes and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is it really?</v>

465
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.890
<v Speaker 3>What's going on really well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

466
00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.120
<v Speaker 3>human beings are constantly trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>achieve things.</v>

467
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the point of staying alive.</v>

468
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:17.160
<v Speaker 3>The point of staying alive is you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to achieve success out there while </v>

469
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.410
<v Speaker 3>you're hunting success while you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishing.</v>

470
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.260
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why hunting and fishing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is so satisfying.</v>

471
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.720
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I plan on going very soon,</v>

472
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to go with Steve Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy from that.</v>

473
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:26.110
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mediator show.</v>

474
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.440

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

475

<v Speaker 3>Name dropper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

476

<v Speaker 3>I need a name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drop the fucker.</v>

477
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.130

<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

478
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.380
<v Speaker 3>We're going to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to hunt bears in Alaska.</v>

479
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:36.310
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

480
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

481
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

482
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.040
<v Speaker 3>how did I get onto that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared.</v>

483
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.260
<v Speaker 3>I just got scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you get?</v>

484
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Scared of bears in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we're talking about just before </v>

485
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:48.270
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

486
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:48.270
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about materialism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

487
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.690
<v Speaker 3>then I think that it's this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

488
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:50.500
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

489
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.390
<v Speaker 3>the reason why it's so satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did get scared.</v>

490
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.290
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moscow.</v>

491
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:55.450
<v Speaker 3>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reason why it's so satisfying.</v>

492
00:21:55.451 --> 00:21:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Hunting and fishing is because those </v>
<v Speaker 3>tasks are.</v>

493
00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.170
<v Speaker 3>That's a prerequisite for staying alive </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the longest time.</v>

494
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.440
<v Speaker 3>For the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way we stayed alive as we had to go </v>

495
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:07.440
<v Speaker 3>out and gather our food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels good to pick food,</v>

496
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.640
<v Speaker 3>like if you find some blueberry </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere and you pick them,</v>

497
00:22:09.641 --> 00:22:14.641
<v Speaker 3>there's like this weird joy that comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your finding and finding a meal </v>

498
00:22:14.641 --> 00:22:18.811
<v Speaker 3>outside that is a natural reward system </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's put in place to ensure our </v>

499
00:22:18.811 --> 00:22:19.000
<v Speaker 3>survival.</v>

500
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Now when there are no hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>gathering tasks to get when it's so easy</v>

501
00:22:23.471 --> 00:22:28.471
<v Speaker 3>to just walk to the store and get meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the choice is to meet and it takes </v>

502
00:22:28.471 --> 00:22:33.451
<v Speaker 3>literally seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I have that big perfectly aged hunk </v>

503
00:22:33.451 --> 00:22:37.831
<v Speaker 3>of flesh that's has no diseases on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ready to cook right away and you know,</v>

504
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:43.020
<v Speaker 3>can I have this milk that's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>homogenized and pasteurized and has no </v>

505
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.071
<v Speaker 3>chance of killing me and I can sit on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shelf for weeks and can I have this </v>

506
00:22:47.071 --> 00:22:49.120
<v Speaker 3>cheese that's also the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very resistant to mold and all.</v>

507
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:54.121
<v Speaker 3>Look at this fresh vegetables that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetically modified and then you can </v>

508
00:22:54.121 --> 00:22:54.790
<v Speaker 3>grow tomatoes in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking winter outside.</v>

509
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all of it is incredible,</v>

510
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.140
<v Speaker 3>but also easy and so accessible that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no reward.</v>

511
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.180
<v Speaker 3>You're not getting that reward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people will just.</v>

512
00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.310
<v Speaker 3>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're being gluttonous,</v>

513
00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:11.670
<v Speaker 3>unlike the native Americans who the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flesh was so important to them to kill </v>

514
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:12.610
<v Speaker 3>with so important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything was so sacred that they would</v>

515
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.790
<v Speaker 3>use every single part of the animal to </v>
<v Speaker 3>honor that animal and they wanted to </v>

516
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.190
<v Speaker 3>keep this relationship with the buffalos</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what the,</v>

517
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.120
<v Speaker 3>the deer and all the animals that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>needed to sustain them.</v>

518
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.240
<v Speaker 3>For us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that system is hijacked,</v>

519
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.010
<v Speaker 3>hijacked by sports cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hijacked by getting ahead.</v>

520
00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:30.430
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

521
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.260
<v Speaker 3>getting a house in the hamptons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's high,</v>

522
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:36.580
<v Speaker 3>it's high jacked by having a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hijacked by all the things that you</v>

523
00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:41.581
<v Speaker 3>can reward yourself for women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's jewelry or shoes where when </v>

524
00:23:41.581 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 3>it's shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of women that they become obsessed</v>

<v Speaker 3>Amazon.com</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

548
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to stick out in your face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I like the way a good machine look </v>

<v Speaker 3>that's what that looks like.</v>

551
00:24:50.841 --> 00:24:54.080
<v Speaker 3>But some people get crazy and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>take it to.</v>

552
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.570
<v Speaker 3>I'd want the finest watched constructed </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the most difficult manner.</v>

553
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Let go in a bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want them to make the watch in a </v>

554
00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:03.580
<v Speaker 3>bottle with tweezers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>all of it's titanium and hand carved and</v>

<v Speaker 3>get the fuck</v>

557
00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.880
<v Speaker 4>made in the bottles to the no dust gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>in it.</v>

558
00:25:11.881 --> 00:25:13.960
<v Speaker 4>Is that the reason for that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just made the bottle part up.</v>

559
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:19.010
<v Speaker 4>It's like making a ship in the bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why the fuck would you make a ship in </v>

560
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.010
<v Speaker 4>the ball?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's stupid.</v>

561
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Who cares you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's harder for you.</v>

562
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.120
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking chip is like whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's a mystery.</v>

564
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.950
<v Speaker 4>I say make something better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

565
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.410
<v Speaker 4>that's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in front of you.</v>

566
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:34.420
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are you making things inside </v>

567
00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:34.420
<v Speaker 4>bottles?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a challenge.</v>

568
00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:34.770
<v Speaker 4>It's like tetris back in the old days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's outrageous.</v>

569
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.170
<v Speaker 4>But Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>posture is one thing.</v>

570
00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:41.180
<v Speaker 4>One thing that you're leaving out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference between primitive and modern </v>

571
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.830
<v Speaker 4>peoples living situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You also have to take into account their</v>

572
00:25:43.831 --> 00:25:45.600
<v Speaker 4>mental state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People,</v>

573
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the native Americans,</v>

574
00:25:47.431 --> 00:25:52.431
<v Speaker 4>they believed in like the great spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know too much about the </v>

575
00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:53.670
<v Speaker 4>universe and the way that we know it.</v>

576
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:58.080
<v Speaker 4>They like had this faith in a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient religion that,</v>

577
00:25:58.081 --> 00:25:59.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that gave them a lot of comfort.</v>

578
00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:05.060
<v Speaker 4>The modern guy who's buying all the ham </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the meat and the fucking ship </v>

579
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.290
<v Speaker 4>watches and bottles and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the crazy woman buying the person's,</v>

580
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:12.450
<v Speaker 4>it gets even more absurd because their </v>
<v Speaker 4>belief in the universe is either,</v>

581
00:26:12.451 --> 00:26:17.451
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fundamentalist Christian or religious </v>

582
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:18.090
<v Speaker 4>belief that's always haunted by science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It all sides.</v>

583
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.030
<v Speaker 4>The whole world is telling them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

584
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.480
<v Speaker 4>a lot of that stuff isn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of that stuff doesn't,</v>

585
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't really happen.</v>

586
00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:26.940
<v Speaker 4>The people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way they're describing that,</v>

587
00:26:26.941 --> 00:26:29.760
<v Speaker 4>nobody flew up into the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now guys flew up into the air,</v>

588
00:26:29.761 --> 00:26:32.280
<v Speaker 4>came,</v>
<v Speaker 4>came back to life after he got nailed to</v>

589
00:26:32.281 --> 00:26:34.500
<v Speaker 4>a cross that's never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't happen this.</v>

590
00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.590
<v Speaker 4>So they're fucking main.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The tenants of their religion are always</v>

591
00:26:37.591 --> 00:26:39.180
<v Speaker 4>getting attacked on all sides by </v>
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>

592
00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.430
<v Speaker 4>And if you're not religious then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>exist.</v>

593
00:26:41.431 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it even more weird.</v>

594
00:26:44.281 --> 00:26:49.281
<v Speaker 4>You're just some like super smart </v>
<v Speaker 4>primate that's been stuck on a ball.</v>

595
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.470
<v Speaker 4>You're December like tiny little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>

596
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:57.471
<v Speaker 4>little primate bug thing that the force </v>
<v Speaker 4>of gravity is keeping stuck to the </v>

597
00:26:57.471 --> 00:27:01.941
<v Speaker 4>ground on a planet spinning around like </v>
<v Speaker 4>your Joe Spinning around a ball of </v>

598
00:27:01.941 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 4>fucking fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like if you don't really believe</v>

599
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:06.480
<v Speaker 4>in God when you're in this super absurd </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>

600
00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:11.481
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like now I have infinite amount of </v>

601
00:27:11.481 --> 00:27:13.620
<v Speaker 4>food and whatever I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just some absurd little speck of</v>

602
00:27:13.621 --> 00:27:14.800
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to believe.</v>

603
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not all atheists think that by the way,</v>

604
00:27:16.921 --> 00:27:19.140
<v Speaker 4>but it is an absurd place to get to.</v>

605
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:24.250
<v Speaker 3>I maintained that the reality of living </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a planet in orbit around the Star in </v>

606
00:27:25.581 --> 00:27:30.581
<v Speaker 3>the galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a universe is so preposterous and </v>

607
00:27:30.581 --> 00:27:32.600
<v Speaker 3>bizarre and strange that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter if you call it,</v>

608
00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big thunder,</v>

609
00:27:33.981 --> 00:27:36.920
<v Speaker 3>God in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't matter if you're,</v>

610
00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:37.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

611
00:27:37.461 --> 00:27:39.710
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have some mythology attached to it.</v>

612
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:44.890
<v Speaker 3>Your reality is your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own perceptions of it are so </v>

613
00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:45.740
<v Speaker 3>abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

614
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 3>There's so not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not something.</v>

615
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Even if you'd have to have fucking been </v>
<v Speaker 3>to space,</v>

616
00:27:50.811 --> 00:27:54.770
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to have to go to a planet or </v>
<v Speaker 3>at least orbit the moon or something.</v>

617
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:59.780
<v Speaker 3>Just really wrap your fucking head </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the fact that there's some other </v>

618
00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.020
<v Speaker 3>shit out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just seems like you're telling me it,</v>

619
00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the numbers.</v>

620
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.760
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds of billions of galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fourteen billion.</v>

621
00:28:07.761 --> 00:28:09.800
<v Speaker 3>I know the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're abstracting.</v>

622
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:14.950
<v Speaker 3>It sounds to me it doesn't sound real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's religion sounds equally </v>

623
00:28:15.741 --> 00:28:17.060
<v Speaker 3>abstract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

624
00:28:17.061 --> 00:28:18.810
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can believe in,</v>

625
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.980
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not comparing science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion and sciences,</v>

626
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been measured and it makes sense.</v>

627
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Most of religion is silly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think to us,</v>

628
00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:34.560
<v Speaker 3>I just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think to us the reality of our </v>

629
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.871
<v Speaker 3>situation is so preposterous that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like religion had to be put in </v>

630
00:28:38.301 --> 00:28:43.301
<v Speaker 3>place to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really makes you wonder like how </v>

631
00:28:43.301 --> 00:28:44.930
<v Speaker 3>quickly people came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>became conscious because like,</v>

632
00:28:44.931 --> 00:28:48.350
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff was shit we had to deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>with like really early on,</v>

633
00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:49.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we,</v>

634
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.720
<v Speaker 3>where are we?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going on,</v>

635
00:28:50.721 --> 00:28:52.130
<v Speaker 3>where is this from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

636
00:28:52.131 --> 00:28:53.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill weld the thunder.</v>

637
00:28:53.421 --> 00:28:57.800
<v Speaker 3>God came down from the sky and like we </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to like really early on,</v>

638
00:28:57.801 --> 00:28:59.690
<v Speaker 3>had to come up with some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>answers.</v>

639
00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:05.670
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the cool things about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Buddhism is that it doesn't have like a </v>

640
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:09.661
<v Speaker 4>thunder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't talk about a thunder God or </v>

641
00:29:09.661 --> 00:29:11.581
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more like someone recognizing that </v>

642
00:29:11.581 --> 00:29:13.060
<v Speaker 4>is whatever these absurd beings are on </v>
<v Speaker 4>this planet.</v>

643
00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:16.480
<v Speaker 4>We all kind of share the same similar </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>

644
00:29:16.481 --> 00:29:20.890
<v Speaker 4>There we are all sharing the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>similar problems and then an analysis of</v>

645
00:29:20.891 --> 00:29:24.010
<v Speaker 4>those problems created like the system </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Buddhism,</v>

646
00:29:24.011 --> 00:29:27.970
<v Speaker 4>which is a way to overcome the thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's trying to make you buy a shitload</v>

647
00:29:27.971 --> 00:29:31.810
<v Speaker 4>of purses and cars and the thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>making you miserable while you're laying</v>

648
00:29:31.811 --> 00:29:33.700
<v Speaker 4>in your fucking nice bed in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>apartment.</v>

649
00:29:33.701 --> 00:29:36.340
<v Speaker 4>It's acknowledging that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking hunting,</v>

650
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:42.180
<v Speaker 4>hunting bears is a native American or if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're lying in your fucking bed is a </v>

651
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.441
<v Speaker 4>modern pepperoni stuffed rich man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You both have the same problem,</v>

652
00:29:47.651 --> 00:29:51.040
<v Speaker 4>which is you're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get old,</v>

653
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.870
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get disease.</v>

654
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.030
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get old age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease and death.</v>

655
00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:00.060
<v Speaker 4>This is an inevitability that we all </v>
<v Speaker 4>share in that all humans have shared </v>

656
00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.630
<v Speaker 4>since the beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't escape it.</v>

657
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.780
<v Speaker 4>So the cool thing about Buddhism is it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not like if you have prayed to the </v>

658
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:07.720
<v Speaker 4>mighty loon loon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll get a blessing.</v>

659
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:08.770
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>

660
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.800
<v Speaker 4>let's sober up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we calm down?</v>

661
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:16.570
<v Speaker 4>Can we overcome all the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>distractions that are surrounding us?</v>

662
00:30:16.571 --> 00:30:21.571
<v Speaker 4>Can we focus our will to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're no longer being buffeted by </v>

663
00:30:21.571 --> 00:30:24.000
<v Speaker 4>circumstances like all of our ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 4>app?</v>

664
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.320
<v Speaker 4>And that's enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

665
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.890
<v Speaker 4>When you wake up and you overcome the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking</v>

666
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.380
<v Speaker 2>sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

667
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:30.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it real enlightenment?</v>

668
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:31.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

669
00:30:31.351 --> 00:30:31.950
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

670
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.990
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of managing your situation.</v>

671
00:30:34.991 --> 00:30:39.991
<v Speaker 2>You're sort of reacted dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistically with what does that even </v>

672
00:30:39.991 --> 00:30:41.170
<v Speaker 2>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What inevitable?</v>

673
00:30:41.171 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Speaker 2>What is the inevitable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the death?</v>

674
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:43.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>

675
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.190
<v Speaker 2>all you know is that this ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know what,</v>

676
00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.170
<v Speaker 2>what takes place next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything,</v>

677
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.480
<v Speaker 2>you know nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for a lot of people just that I </v>

678
00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.971
<v Speaker 2>think was too much and people also have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that natural primate need to be right.</v>

679
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.360
<v Speaker 2>The need to follow the Alpha need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have someone who seems to be the leader </v>

680
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.820
<v Speaker 2>of the gang and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible to do that unless</v>

681
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:08.860
<v Speaker 2>you got a religion rock and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

682
00:31:08.861 --> 00:31:11.680
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard unless you have not </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a guy,</v>

683
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.950
<v Speaker 2>but a guy who appeals to the gods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

684
00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.250
<v Speaker 2>an intermediary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who's like,</v>

685
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:23.310
<v Speaker 2>God's manager makes it's way easy to run</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit because you're like way closer to </v>

686
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.310
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

687
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

688
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:28.850
<v Speaker 4>it's the greatest trick ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you drink a bunch of people to think </v>

689
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:29.640
<v Speaker 4>that you're the one who can communicate </v>
<v Speaker 4>with God,</v>

690
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.060
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

691
00:31:30.061 --> 00:31:30.540
<v Speaker 4>I wrap it up,</v>

692
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.140

699
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.610
<v Speaker 2>but you could start a call if you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

700
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.010
<v Speaker 2>If you were a crazy person,</v>

791
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:18.290
<v Speaker 5>fair for credit card companies to charge</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what they're doing now up to 30,</v>

792
00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.800

795
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:30.401
<v Speaker 5>minimum and you'll pay that off for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rest of your life and you're just keep </v>

<v Speaker 5>paying them and you'll know you will </v>

797
00:35:33.041 --> 00:35:33.041

808
00:36:49.221 --> 00:36:49.221
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know where.</v>

809
00:36:49.221 --> 00:36:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I bet that would be a funny podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Brendan Walsh is a funny </v>

810
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.790
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one guy,</v>

811
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:53.970
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a podcast whole network of um,</v>

812
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
<v Speaker 2>called death squad that were also </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in Brian runs all of them and </v>

813
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.720
<v Speaker 2>they're all on itunes and all for free </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they include the ice house </v>

814
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.711
<v Speaker 2>chronicles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is one of the best </v>

815
00:37:06.711 --> 00:37:06.711
<v Speaker 2>podcasts we do and what the icehouse </v>
<v Speaker 2>chronicles is.</v>

816
00:37:06.711 --> 00:37:09.590
<v Speaker 2>We're actually going to do one after I </v>
<v Speaker 2>do this podcast with Duncan and what is,</v>

817
00:37:09.591 --> 00:37:11.820
<v Speaker 2>is while the show was going on at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ice house,</v>

818
00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 2>we also come over here and we fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and talk shit and have a podcast,</v>

819
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.910
<v Speaker 2>a lot of fun and it's a real green room.</v>

820
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.740
<v Speaker 2>Like it's an actual green room of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

821
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll see people saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

822
00:37:21.901 --> 00:37:24.060
<v Speaker 2>am I on my own now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they'll run out of the room and</v>

823
00:37:24.061 --> 00:37:25.220
<v Speaker 2>go onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

824
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.050
<v Speaker 2>it's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that,</v>

825
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:30.930
<v Speaker 2>that Paul Provenza show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the green room I enjoyed.</v>

826
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.400
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy whenever you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

827
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.270
<v Speaker 2>Stan hope and Dave attell and Janeane </v>
<v Speaker 2>Garofalo in a room together and let them</v>

828
00:37:36.271 --> 00:37:38.270
<v Speaker 2>argue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie Kilstein,</v>

829
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:39.600
<v Speaker 2>whoever was in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

830
00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.070
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy that,</v>

831
00:37:41.071 --> 00:37:46.071
<v Speaker 2>but this is a real green room of a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>show of a bunch of guys who worked </v>

832
00:37:46.071 --> 00:37:50.301
<v Speaker 2>together on a regular basis and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to get any weird awkwardness </v>

833
00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:51.930
<v Speaker 2>or people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are attacking people.</v>

834
00:37:51.931 --> 00:37:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Most of it is just a lot of fun with </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally Brian,</v>

835
00:37:55.020 --> 00:38:00.020

<v Speaker 2>but those have been love those.</v>

837
00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:06.820
<v Speaker 2>They love those moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

838
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:10.080
<v Speaker 2>We've got a few incidents where Brian </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought people in and be like,</v>

839
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.530
<v Speaker 2>this person,</v>

840
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

847
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:31.160

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready date somebody that I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have dated when I was 21,</v>

849
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:40.200
<v Speaker 2>like like when I was 21,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was date someone that you should be </v>

850
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:40.730
<v Speaker 2>dating when you're 37.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crazier asshole.</v>

851
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Even scarier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty seven year olds in Los Angeles.</v>

852
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:49.651
<v Speaker 2>That's the scariest bottom of the weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes for the most part the is </v>

853
00:38:49.651 --> 00:38:54.540
<v Speaker 2>really bad times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you and sometimes it's like </v>

854
00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.031
<v Speaker 2>Duncan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's a guy or girl for you </v>

855
00:38:57.031 --> 00:39:00.120
<v Speaker 2>who's at a certain point in their life </v>
<v Speaker 2>has actually learned a lot of shit and </v>

856
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:00.120
<v Speaker 2>it's actually fun to be around.</v>

857
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:05.790
<v Speaker 2>We all assume chauvinistically as men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially that when you meet a girl </v>

858
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.080
<v Speaker 2>that's in their late thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just going to be a fucking wreck.</v>

859
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:13.400
<v Speaker 2>She goes to screaming wreck of </v>
<v Speaker 2>desperation and fear and blame my age.</v>

860
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Want to make babies quick so they trick </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

861
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.960
<v Speaker 2>They try to play exactly who they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want you to be interested in me.</v>

862
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know someone who absolutely </v>

863
00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:30.511
<v Speaker 2>unquestionably was tricked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The girl he was dating was older and </v>

864
00:39:30.511 --> 00:39:32.740
<v Speaker 2>they like right away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started dating and she said that she was</v>

865
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:36.010
<v Speaker 2>on the pill and she got off the pill </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

866
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.320
<v Speaker 2>She immediately knew that she was only </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

867
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.410
<v Speaker 2>I think she was like 35 or 36,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>

868
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it gets with women.</v>

869
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Not all women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously most of them that aren't </v>

870
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:51.361
<v Speaker 2>deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where it gets with some women it's </v>

871
00:39:51.361 --> 00:39:51.361
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

872
00:39:51.361 --> 00:39:51.361
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck what he wants.</v>

873
00:39:51.361 --> 00:39:55.710
<v Speaker 2>I only get one more shot at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be in some sort of </v>

874
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.471
<v Speaker 2>relationship with some guy by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has plenty of money so he can take </v>

875
00:39:58.471 --> 00:39:58.540
<v Speaker 2>care of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if the kid doesn't work out,</v>

876
00:39:58.541 --> 00:40:00.280
<v Speaker 2>this is what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a child.</v>

877
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.800
<v Speaker 2>This guy's got money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got genetics,</v>

878
00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 2>and they'll just take the loads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll just take the loads and you have</v>

879
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:09.820
<v Speaker 2>to pretend that you have to somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

880
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to.</v>

881
00:40:11.441 --> 00:40:12.940
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're having sexually or when you're</v>

882
00:40:12.941 --> 00:40:14.440
<v Speaker 2>not wearing a condom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

883
00:40:14.441 --> 00:40:19.441
<v Speaker 2>you have to realize that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility that someone could do that </v>

884
00:40:19.441 --> 00:40:20.410
<v Speaker 2>and it's totally illegal by the way she </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do that.</v>

885
00:40:20.411 --> 00:40:24.010
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if she was deceptive,</v>

886
00:40:24.011 --> 00:40:29.011
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she could lose in court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she could probably say it's her </v>

887
00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:29.011
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

888
00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:29.011
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

889
00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:29.011
<v Speaker 2>I think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

890
00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:33.931
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you took the pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody ever sued someone based on </v>

891
00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:37.741
<v Speaker 2>whether or not they took the pill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pill is like they say it's 99 </v>

892
00:40:37.741 --> 00:40:37.860
<v Speaker 2>percent effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet it's 100 percent effective.</v>

893
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:40.260
<v Speaker 2>Just one people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such wretched line cons.</v>

894
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.350
<v Speaker 2>It's unprovable in court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

895
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:45.520
<v Speaker 2>it's very possible that the pill is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight up affective.</v>

896
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:49.820
<v Speaker 2>Would you ever get your shit a snipped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe save some sperm that.</v>

897
00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he say to you the sperm also a no.</v>

898
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:56.740
<v Speaker 2>He did not say I save your spring break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be reversed,</v>

899
00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.190
<v Speaker 2>but doug's loads at this point or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking completely useless.</v>

900
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.440
<v Speaker 2>His loads will come out like a wet </v>
<v Speaker 2>cardboard.</v>

901
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:06.810
<v Speaker 2>There's no way they're impregnating </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody getting reversed.</v>

902
00:41:06.811 --> 00:41:09.760
<v Speaker 2>This has this weird visual that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>penis would be just so broken looking.</v>

903
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

904
00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:12.760
<v Speaker 2>You're paying this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's under something with your balls.</v>

905
00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:14.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't even see that.</v>

906
00:41:14.141 --> 00:41:16.150
<v Speaker 2>But the innards man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's really crazy.</v>

907
00:41:16.151 --> 00:41:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Trying to reattach a tube and it might </v>
<v Speaker 2>not work.</v>

908
00:41:18.521 --> 00:41:20.470
<v Speaker 2>It might not take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

909
00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:24.520
<v Speaker 2>This is like the worst felony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

910
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:27.070
<v Speaker 2>there's another way of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is another way of doing it.</v>

911
00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:28.230
<v Speaker 2>There's a new way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

912
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I saw online where they're doing it now </v>
<v Speaker 2>with like a clip there actually bending </v>

913
00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

914
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.110
<v Speaker 3>and pinching it and cutting off with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>clip.</v>

915
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 3>And the idea behind the clip is that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be reversible,</v>

916
00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:40.800
<v Speaker 3>but I always think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

917
00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.440
<v Speaker 3>you're doing Jujitsu and some guy goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>neon belly on you,</v>

918
00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:47.330
<v Speaker 3>hard pops your fucking flip out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And next thing you know,</v>

919
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:49.070
<v Speaker 3>well listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the reality.</v>

920
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:54.490
<v Speaker 3>You get a big guy on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I control neon bellies and </v>

921
00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:54.490
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's a really weak muscle.</v>

00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:42.800
<v Speaker 3>If you try to squeeze your Dick Muscle </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now as you're sitting here,</v>

941
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.150

<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>

944
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.490
<v Speaker 3>when you have to come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to come.</v>

945
00:42:52.491 --> 00:42:54.320
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

946
00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:55.260
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>don't move and just grab her and hold </v>

948
00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:03.581
<v Speaker 3>her in place to move and you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy and it just forget it.</v>

949
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.400
<v Speaker 3>That's when load sneak out and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>how people get pregnant.</v>

950
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe the idea?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

951
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.370
<v Speaker 4>that I'm like the galleries in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tantric sex,</v>

952
00:43:13.371 --> 00:43:16.910
<v Speaker 4>people believe that you actually lose </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy when you come,</v>

953
00:43:16.911 --> 00:43:20.240
<v Speaker 4>like if you come too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're losing some form of energy.</v>

954
00:43:20.241 --> 00:43:21.530
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like some boxers,</v>

955
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:24.170
<v Speaker 4>they won't ejaculate like before a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

956
00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.570
<v Speaker 4>but they won't have sex before a fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they want to.</v>

957
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:31.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've actually proven physiologically </v>

958
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:33.520
<v Speaker 3>proven that if you don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>release within seven days,</v>

959
00:43:33.521 --> 00:43:37.060
<v Speaker 3>your testosterone goes up significantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Significantly.</v>

960
00:43:37.061 --> 00:43:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Like measurably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

961
00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the actual number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was enough so that it would.</v>

962
00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.510
<v Speaker 3>It would warrant doing that if you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fighter,</v>

963
00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:48.490
<v Speaker 3>but for some fighters there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difficult thing is relaxing.</v>

964
00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:53.610
<v Speaker 3>The difficult thing is getting in there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and being able to fight up to your </v>

965
00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:53.860
<v Speaker 3>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the amount of testosterone that</v>

966
00:43:53.861 --> 00:43:57.700
<v Speaker 3>you're producing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's how well are you in control of your</v>

967
00:43:57.701 --> 00:44:01.000
<v Speaker 3>mind because your mind is what's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to guide you through this fucking thing.</v>

968
00:44:01.001 --> 00:44:06.001
<v Speaker 3>Your mind is going to have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of nipples come and </v>

969
00:44:06.001 --> 00:44:08.110
<v Speaker 3>flying at your face and jumping knees </v>
<v Speaker 3>and dudes try to take you down to try to</v>

970
00:44:08.111 --> 00:44:13.111
<v Speaker 3>throw you literally on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your mind is dealing with all this and </v>

971
00:44:13.111 --> 00:44:16.831
<v Speaker 3>your mind has gotta be on point and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind has got to be relaxed enough to not</v>

972
00:44:17.951 --> 00:44:22.951
<v Speaker 3>freeze up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relax enough to respond to the pressure </v>

973
00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:25.900
<v Speaker 3>and do the smart thing and not not get </v>
<v Speaker 3>exhausted quickly because of anxiety.</v>

974
00:44:25.901 --> 00:44:29.620
<v Speaker 3>That's a big problem with guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're mine gets them so like this that</v>

975
00:44:29.621 --> 00:44:34.621
<v Speaker 3>their bodies like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this anymore because they're </v>

976
00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:34.621
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

977
00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:37.040
<v Speaker 2>inefficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so completely inefficient in </v>

978
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.561
<v Speaker 2>their use of their body that everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a is a strain and everything is a </v>

979
00:44:39.561 --> 00:44:42.000
<v Speaker 2>sprint and they become exhausted like </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost immediately.</v>

980
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learning to get in that fucking </v>

981
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.270
<v Speaker 2>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

982
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was saying is in that case,</v>

983
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:52.071
<v Speaker 2>I would say that you should have sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then you're not going to at </v>

984
00:44:52.071 --> 00:44:52.140
<v Speaker 2>least think about the sex because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not having sex,</v>

985
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.050
<v Speaker 2>you're built up with those testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're just thinking about pussy and</v>

986
00:44:55.060 --> 00:45:00.060
<v Speaker 2>are so confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might not even be able to be </v>

987
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.481
<v Speaker 2>comfortable in their you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might not be able to like get loose </v>

988
00:45:02.481 --> 00:45:02.481
<v Speaker 2>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

989
00:45:02.481 --> 00:45:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get it out of your system,</v>

990
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.270
<v Speaker 2>you get the sex that you're still going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

991
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:08.140
<v Speaker 2>you still feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

992
00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of an effect does it have on </v>

993
00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:13.360
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

994
00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:13.360
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have an effect on you where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to the gym and your week.</v>

995
00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm at sex and go the gym and I feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

996
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:21.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not that much of a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for a lot of guys you'd be </v>

997
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 2>better off just having a sex to calm </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

998
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Get it out of your system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

999
00:45:22.771 --> 00:45:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1000
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.430
<v Speaker 2>don't ask me man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1001
00:45:25.431 --> 00:45:30.431

<v Speaker 2>maybe you can go like four days without </v>

1002
00:45:30.431 --> 00:45:30.431
<v Speaker 2>jerking off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not having sex the mud,</v>

1003
00:45:30.431 --> 00:45:32.910
<v Speaker 2>so I have no idea the whole here's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect mystery to me,</v>

1004
00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Taoism and the whole contract thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know if it's something I </v>

1005
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.290
<v Speaker 2>wonder about because it's two systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that both,</v>

1006
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:45.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have really developed systems around </v>

1007

<v Speaker 2>this idea of like extending your orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like somehow they can like supposedly </v>

00:46:54.491 --> 00:46:56.340
<v Speaker 2>It would be the worst thing would be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst drug.</v>

1037
00:46:56.341 --> 00:46:58.500
<v Speaker 2>He'd always be around people coming like</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever,</v>

1038
00:46:58.501 --> 00:47:01.950
<v Speaker 2>like you'd go to parties and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just sat on the couch having orgasms.</v>

1039
00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.960
<v Speaker 2>That's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1040
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:06.800
<v Speaker 2>that's not like a really difficult thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to represent chemical.</v>

1041
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1042
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they could come up with an </v>

1043
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:14.601
<v Speaker 2>orgasm pill that's around the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one ever would have thought a hard </v>

1044
00:47:14.601 --> 00:47:17.250
<v Speaker 2>dick pill would have been feasible or </v>
<v Speaker 2>achievable so quickly and easily.</v>

1045
00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:22.810
<v Speaker 2>No plague of so many fucking think how </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard it would have been to have an </v>

1046
00:47:22.951 --> 00:47:27.951
<v Speaker 2>erection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're looking down at your wife's </v>

1047
00:47:27.951 --> 00:47:30.981
<v Speaker 2>flea covered pussy that hasn't had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shower and yeah,</v>

1048
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.770
<v Speaker 2>there's no showers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could even be if they bathed,</v>

1049
00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.180
<v Speaker 2>you had to get like buckets of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to bring them by the river.</v>

1050
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:41.200
<v Speaker 2>By the time you get to go over and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>again to probably take you an hour and a</v>

1051
00:47:41.201 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 2>half each fucking trip back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and forth.</v>

1052
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:45.880
<v Speaker 2>I'll get the rest of it tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what do you do?</v>

1053
00:47:45.881 --> 00:47:47.690
<v Speaker 2>You boil the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on there?</v>

1054
00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.900
<v Speaker 2>Or just take an ice cold bath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Then you draw your dirty ass off on some</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking skin.</v>

1056
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Still Gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dirty again?</v>

1057
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did people smell like back there?</v>

1058
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:09.510
<v Speaker 2>What if it balanced out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If like all the bacteria in your body </v>

1059
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:11.650
<v Speaker 2>will just fight each other off until it </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to like a balanced warfare state.</v>

1060
00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:16.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issue with us is that we clean our </v>

1061
00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:17.740
<v Speaker 2>skin so much that we lose a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy bacteria outside of your skin.</v>

1062
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:19.590
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1063
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:24.720
<v Speaker 2>problems with people that have A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obsessive compulsive and they have </v>

1064
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.390
<v Speaker 2>to clean everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1065
00:48:25.391 --> 00:48:30.391
<v Speaker 2>A phobia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it called when you're afraid of </v>

1066
00:48:30.391 --> 00:48:30.391
<v Speaker 2>germs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1067
00:48:30.391 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Howie Mendell gets warts on his hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>

1068
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he uses that hand cleaner so </v>

1069
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:38.550
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's heavy.</v>

1070
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:38.650
<v Speaker 2>It's getting worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's getting worse.</v>

1071
00:48:38.651 --> 00:48:43.651
<v Speaker 2>Somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a podcast the other day where </v>

1072
00:48:43.651 --> 00:48:43.651
<v Speaker 2>somebody knew he won't even touch </v>
<v Speaker 2>knuckles with you anymore.</v>

1073
00:48:43.651 --> 00:48:44.560
<v Speaker 2>He used to touch knuckles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now he won't even do that.</v>

1074
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:45.220
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1075
00:48:45.221 --> 00:48:50.221
<v Speaker 2>we've already talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you consider how filthy the </v>

1076
00:48:50.221 --> 00:48:52.300
<v Speaker 2>assholes and most people in the western </v>
<v Speaker 2>world are,</v>

1077
00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:57.570
<v Speaker 2>it kind of makes sense man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like we've sort of using toilet </v>

1078
00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:58.720
<v Speaker 2>paper to wipe your.</v>

1079
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.640
<v Speaker 2>You're using toilet paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1080
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:05.670
<v Speaker 2>That is gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But being such a Germaphobia is </v>

1081
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:06.940
<v Speaker 2>preposterous because we are not one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1082
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:10.360
<v Speaker 2>We're terrified of these germs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have germs in us.</v>

1083
00:49:10.361 --> 00:49:13.180
<v Speaker 2>We are germs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know we're not just one thing.</v>

1084
00:49:13.181 --> 00:49:14.680
<v Speaker 2>You should clean your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1085
00:49:14.681 --> 00:49:16.870
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should definitely wash your dishes.</v>

1086
00:49:16.871 --> 00:49:18.370
<v Speaker 2>You should clean your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should,</v>

1087
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.530
<v Speaker 2>but you also shouldn't be a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>freak.</v>

1088
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.000
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be crazy about it.</v>

1089
00:49:22.001 --> 00:49:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Don't be afraid to touch a table because</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody might have touched it before.</v>

1090
00:49:24.431 --> 00:49:27.850
<v Speaker 2>You just wash your goddamn hands in each</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables so they know.</v>

1091
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.910
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1092
00:49:28.911 --> 00:49:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean I get given Duncan a couple stink</v>
<v Speaker 2>watches before where you don't wash your</v>

1093
00:49:32.591 --> 00:49:37.591
<v Speaker 2>finger and then when you shake hands you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of rub it on the inside of </v>

1094
00:49:37.591 --> 00:49:37.591
<v Speaker 2>their hand right here and it makes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>smell food.</v>

1095
00:49:37.591 --> 00:49:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Ah Jeez man.</v>

1096
00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:43.820
<v Speaker 5>You guys were talking about on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcast.</v>

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:48.060
<v Speaker 5>It's you asshole Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just is asking know what I do.</v>

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.930
<v Speaker 5>He sits there and watches his asshole </v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

1099
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:55.980
<v Speaker 5>And that's completely false.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The you have your asshole and I'm </v>

<v Speaker 5>asshole by mistake before or at least at</v>

1103
00:50:04.021 --> 00:50:05.970
<v Speaker 5>least once or twice in life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Make sure that if I do have to itch my </v>
<v Speaker 5>asshole that I wash my hands afterwards.</v>

1105
00:50:09.991 --> 00:50:12.790
<v Speaker 5>I am not convinced that you do the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1121
00:50:54.071 --> 00:50:56.471
<v Speaker 2>asshole stories and that's how it got </v>
<v Speaker 2>started in the first place you had a </v>

1122
00:50:56.471 --> 00:50:57.320
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a podcast where you jumped in the</v>

1123
00:50:57.321 --> 00:50:59.990
<v Speaker 2>middle of it and started talking about </v>

1130
00:51:19.951 --> 00:51:23.420
<v Speaker 2>is because I heard you talk about it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dunkin's podcast that I did this when in</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1149
00:52:12.561 --> 00:52:13.520
<v Speaker 2>That's silly.</v>

1151
00:52:16.401 --> 00:52:18.170
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it becomes fun.</v>

1152
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.870
<v Speaker 2>You can't have you guys here if you're </v>

<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1157
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:36.150
<v Speaker 2>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a possible example that you could </v>

1158
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.700
<v Speaker 2>invest your asshole and then not gone to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bathroom and washed it.</v>

1159
00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.700
<v Speaker 2>It was very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very possible.</v>

1160
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:42.560

<v Speaker 2>also do the same thing.</v>

1171
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:10.670
<v Speaker 2>If there's anything that we grew fond </v>

<v Speaker 2>the fact and I was telling you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like that is very defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see a dead mouse and Madonna?</v>

<v Speaker 2>isn't it or is that a DNA?</v>

1226
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:24.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's written kind of.</v>

1227

<v Speaker 2>So she's just trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's trying to pump up our album.</v>

1228
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's part of her thing is </v>

1229
00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:32.290
<v Speaker 2>connecting ourselves to this very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very popular rave drug.</v>

1230
00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:36.150
<v Speaker 2>So I'm dead mouse gets a mad about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he gets pissed at her and saying,</v>

1231
00:55:36.151 --> 00:55:37.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her daughter,</v>

1232
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.280
<v Speaker 2>you know you're connecting drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the electronic dance music movement,</v>

1233
00:55:41.281 --> 00:55:42.750
<v Speaker 2>and you shouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1234
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.080
<v Speaker 2>you don't need his ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need drugs to enjoy that move.</v>

1235
00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:46.770
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1236
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.180
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1237
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:49.350
<v Speaker 2>the music that he's making or any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those artists are making,</v>

1238
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:51.780
<v Speaker 2>which is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do not need drugs to do that.</v>

1239
00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:56.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've listened to stuff and I enjoyed it </v>

1240
00:55:56.781 --> 00:55:56.781
<v Speaker 2>and I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't on drugs.</v>

1241
00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:00.210
<v Speaker 2>If you took Mtma he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have any experience in it.</v>

1242
00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:02.490
<v Speaker 2>So that's why it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for him to say that,</v>

1243
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:03.540
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1244
00:56:03.541 --> 00:56:03.990
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1245
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:09.050
<v Speaker 2>you're talking shit about an experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for some people is maybe the most </v>

1246
00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:14.120
<v Speaker 2>energetic and positive experience I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever had in their life is being high on </v>

1247
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:14.760
<v Speaker 2>ecstasy at a rave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listening to dance,</v>

1248
00:56:14.761 --> 00:56:15.270
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

1249
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:20.900
<v Speaker 2>being an excellent mgma and standing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of a speaker the size of a house </v>

1250
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 2>blasting</v>

1251
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.380
<v Speaker 4>out fucking awesome house music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing like that.</v>

1252
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 4>It's a cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the best.</v>

1253
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.650
<v Speaker 4>That's what most people go to see that </v>
<v Speaker 4>music,</v>

1254
00:56:32.651 --> 00:56:33.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1255
00:56:33.251 --> 00:56:38.251
<v Speaker 4>And Molly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the whole point of listening to </v>

1256
00:56:38.251 --> 00:56:40.051
<v Speaker 4>the music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what he's saying is it's giving his </v>

1257
00:56:40.051 --> 00:56:40.051
<v Speaker 4>electronic music a bad name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1258
00:56:40.051 --> 00:56:42.760
<v Speaker 4>like you don't have to enjoy listening </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that kind of music on my.</v>

1259
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:47.850
<v Speaker 4>But I think that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like saying reggae music without </v>

1260
00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:50.701
<v Speaker 4>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like saying like rap without </v>

1261
00:56:50.701 --> 00:56:50.701
<v Speaker 4>stealing a car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're certainly not going to.</v>

1262
00:56:50.701 --> 00:56:55.470
<v Speaker 4>That is something I remember that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like back in the day when I used to </v>

1263
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:59.461
<v Speaker 4>go to the Raves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was like one section of people who </v>

1264
00:56:59.461 --> 00:57:00.520
<v Speaker 4>would go to go to the res and a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>small one.</v>

1265
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:05.910
<v Speaker 4>We're a group of like connoisseurs of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the music who didn't think that you </v>

1266
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:08.590
<v Speaker 4>should pollute your mind with the drugs </v>
<v Speaker 4>and just enjoy purely enjoy the music.</v>

1267
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:13.620
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem is we had dead mouse on the </v>

1268
00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:15.091
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was drunk as fuck and he wouldn't </v>

1269
00:57:15.091 --> 00:57:15.300
<v Speaker 4>stop smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He</v>

1270
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:17.840
<v Speaker 3>chain smoke cigarettes and he was drunk </v>
<v Speaker 3>as fuck.</v>

1271
00:57:17.841 --> 00:57:19.520
<v Speaker 3>And I enjoyed hanging out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong,</v>

1272
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:21.140
<v Speaker 3>I like to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he's,</v>

1273
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:24.410
<v Speaker 3>I think his whole thought processes is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

1274
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:30.130
<v Speaker 3>It's uninformed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think if he had experiences with </v>

1275
00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:33.710
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic drugs and music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not that MDM is a psychedelic and</v>

1276
00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:36.920
<v Speaker 3>you can be happened once that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is what they call it,</v>

1277
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:39.410
<v Speaker 3>but it's impactful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is what it is.</v>

1278
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:44.430
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has a Mtma had a very strong </v>

1279
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:46.430
<v Speaker 3>influence on my behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gave me a very,</v>

1280
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:50.540
<v Speaker 3>very deep insight into behavior patterns</v>
<v Speaker 3>and insecurity.</v>

1281
00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:53.300
<v Speaker 3>I said on my message board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1282
00:57:53.301 --> 00:57:55.760
<v Speaker 3>I think he could use some Mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think it could,</v>

1283
00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that he's a bad guy,</v>

1284
00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:59.960
<v Speaker 3>but I think that there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people,</v>

1285
00:57:59.961 --> 00:58:03.110
<v Speaker 3>they have a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>unnecessary anger inside of them,</v>

1286
00:58:03.111 --> 00:58:08.111
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount of unnecessary judgment</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Mtma will knock that shit right out </v>

1287
00:58:08.111 --> 00:58:11.861
<v Speaker 3>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a loving feeling and that's </v>

1288
00:58:11.861 --> 00:58:12.860
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why they're using it </v>
<v Speaker 3>for posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

1289
00:58:12.861 --> 00:58:15.080
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for vets coming back from,</v>

1290
00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.720
<v Speaker 3>from Iraq and Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1291
00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.010
<v Speaker 3>that's a positive thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1292
00:58:19.011 --> 00:58:21.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our people abusing it and dancing.</v>

1293
00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Of course they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that goes back to what I said in </v>

1294
00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 3>that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Union people can abuse </v>

1295
00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:29.830
<v Speaker 3>cheeseburgers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should we make cheeseburgers illegal?</v>

1296
00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:31.450
<v Speaker 3>I can take a fork and stick in my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would make fortunately.</v>

1297
00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:33.580
<v Speaker 4>Do you know how many people a year die </v>
<v Speaker 4>from drinking?</v>

1298
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:36.460
<v Speaker 4>The statistic is 100,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1299
00:58:36.461 --> 00:58:37.800
<v Speaker 4>between 70 and 100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that</v>

1300
00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.330
<v Speaker 3>doesn't even include drunk driving </v>
<v Speaker 3>deaths.</v>

1301
00:58:39.331 --> 00:58:41.940
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the desk themselves to death.</v>

1302
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:45.990
<v Speaker 3>People die from alcohol poisoning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People died from overdosing on alcohol.</v>

1303
00:58:45.991 --> 00:58:49.230
<v Speaker 3>People die from sclerosis of the liver </v>
<v Speaker 3>directly related to alcoholism.</v>

1304
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:54.950
<v Speaker 3>But MTMA is a small amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like illegal drugs in this country </v>

1305
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:55.950
<v Speaker 3>is only like 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people die here.</v>

1306
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:58.170
<v Speaker 3>The real problem is prescription drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

1307
00:58:58.171 --> 00:59:00.120
<v Speaker 3>which you're overcoming drunk driving </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidents.</v>

1308
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:01.950
<v Speaker 3>And as far as fatalities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

1309
00:59:01.951 --> 00:59:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Those are the words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People die from those left and right.</v>

1310
00:59:04.411 --> 00:59:05.820
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who died,</v>

1311
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.400
<v Speaker 3>but I have a friend who died in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York,</v>

1312
00:59:07.401 --> 00:59:12.401
<v Speaker 3>a pool player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was a great guy and a straight </v>

1313
00:59:12.401 --> 00:59:12.401
<v Speaker 3>edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was straight edge,</v>

1314
00:59:12.401 --> 00:59:17.330
<v Speaker 3>made fun of people smoke cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden he hurt his </v>

1315
00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:17.330
<v Speaker 3>back and when he hurt his back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a.</v>

1316
00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:21.450
<v Speaker 3>He got on some oxycodones or one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those and just that was it ya.</v>

1317
00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.110
<v Speaker 3>Bye Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trains changes.</v>

1318
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Life fell asleep and his mashed </v>
<v Speaker 3>potatoes.</v>

1319
00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:26.610
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's hanging out together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fucking.</v>

1320
00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:28.490
<v Speaker 3>I just falls asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sitting there eating dinner,</v>

1321
00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:30.630
<v Speaker 3>plopped down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sat like a movie plot,</v>

1322
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.450
<v Speaker 3>puts his arm down and falls asleep on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>plate.</v>

1323
00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.890
<v Speaker 4>So sad dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the saddest thing ever,</v>

1324
00:59:36.891 --> 00:59:37.850
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

1325
00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:42.880
<v Speaker 4>It's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really sad when you consider that </v>

1326
00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:42.890
<v Speaker 4>these drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these synthetic drugs that people are,</v>

1327
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:45.500
<v Speaker 4>that are killing so many people are semi</v>
<v Speaker 4>legal.</v>

1328
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.200
<v Speaker 4>Alcohol is killing everybody and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally legal.</v>

1329
00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:52.880
<v Speaker 4>Whereas these empath and an empathogen </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Mtma that when you take it,</v>

1330
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:55.010
<v Speaker 4>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have some discipline,</v>

1331
00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:57.200
<v Speaker 4>you can go dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fun to go dancing on it,</v>

1332
00:59:57.201 --> 01:00:02.201
<v Speaker 4>but if you have some discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can shift your life into the </v>

1333
01:00:02.201 --> 01:00:03.180
<v Speaker 4>positive forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1334
01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:08.280
<v Speaker 4>If you have some discipline and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're working with someone or if </v>

1335
01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:08.280
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you know what you're doing,</v>

1336
01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:12.500
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're honest with your about your </v>

1337
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.451
<v Speaker 3>experience of your person who's truly </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking to improve who you are as a </v>

1338
01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:16.380
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think NBM Mtma can be very impactful.</v>

1339
01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:19.770
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like the way it made me feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't recommend anybody doing it.</v>

1340
01:00:19.771 --> 01:00:20.370
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1341
01:00:20.371 --> 01:00:25.371
<v Speaker 3>you have to weigh your pros and cons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though it impacted me in a very </v>

1342
01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:28.791
<v Speaker 3>positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember feeling absolutely terrible </v>

1343
01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:29.190
<v Speaker 3>the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's good for your body.</v>

1344
01:00:29.191 --> 01:00:34.191
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do it again just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I learned a lot from doing it and </v>

1345
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:36.330
<v Speaker 3>the fact that oxycontin's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are literally synthetic,</v>

1346
01:00:36.331 --> 01:00:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Carolyn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally this,</v>

1347
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:39.870
<v Speaker 3>that is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no data.</v>

1348
01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.230
<v Speaker 3>It is a synthetic opiate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is incredibly,</v>

1349
01:00:43.231 --> 01:00:48.231
<v Speaker 3>incredibly addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who've done heroin say it's </v>

1350
01:00:48.231 --> 01:00:48.231
<v Speaker 3>easier to kick heroin than it is to kick</v>
<v Speaker 3>pills.</v>

1351
01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:51.510
<v Speaker 3>The oxycontin pills somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the way they're constructed,</v>

1352
01:00:51.511 --> 01:00:54.780
<v Speaker 3>the way it impacts with the human body </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes them even more addictive.</v>

1353
01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:55.980
<v Speaker 3>It's just insanity.</v>

1354
01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:57.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking fish hooks,</v>

1355
01:00:57.361 --> 01:01:02.361
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There fish hooks coming out of the </v>

1356
01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:02.361
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical companies to get stuck in</v>
<v Speaker 4>people's brains.</v>

1357
01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:06.180
<v Speaker 4>You get a fucking fish hook in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain attached to a giant corporation.</v>

1358
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:09.510
<v Speaker 4>It's got you fucking wired in whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting it legally or not.</v>

1359
01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:14.660
<v Speaker 4>It's like telephone wires all connecting</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to the telephone company from the </v>

1360
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:17.750
<v Speaker 4>brain's all these pill poppers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just fucking lines going back.</v>

1361
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.650
<v Speaker 3>No benefit whatsoever except a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit of pain relief.</v>

1362
01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:25.700
<v Speaker 3>The benefit social,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social benefit of MTMA would be </v>

1363
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.130
<v Speaker 3>gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Madison County and maybe Kim legal.</v>

1364
01:01:27.131 --> 01:01:30.580
<v Speaker 3>You imagine that it was prescribed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is also,</v>

1365
01:01:30.581 --> 01:01:32.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got people who would oh,</v>

1366
01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.440
<v Speaker 3>on and people who drink when they take </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1367
01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:39.720
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of different </v>

1368
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:39.720
<v Speaker 3>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People could fuck it up.</v>

1369
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:39.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can fuck it up.</v>

1370
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:40.360
<v Speaker 4>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get to you because their,</v>

1371
01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:41.480
<v Speaker 4>it's their life and their.</v>

1372
01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.640
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they can do that with alcohol and </v>

1373
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:46.640

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1374
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.761
<v Speaker 3>the fact that there's all these laws </v>
<v Speaker 3>against things like MDM and mushrooms </v>

1375
01:01:49.761 --> 01:01:54.681

<v Speaker 3>you have to eat like pounds of it.</v>

01:01:57.990 --> 01:02:01.290
<v Speaker 3>The ld 50 rate for for mushrooms is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really high.</v>

<v Speaker 3>which by the way is you could eat way </v>
<v Speaker 3>less salt and you'd be dead.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get eat like you don't even have to </v>

<v Speaker 3>eating salt.</v>

1388
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:20.730

<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1390
01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:23.830
<v Speaker 3>You're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1391
01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:28.850
<v Speaker 3>You could die from drinking water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember we were in Sacramento and that </v>

1392
01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:29.060
<v Speaker 3>lady died and a contest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The contest.</v>

1393
01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:32.250
<v Speaker 3>It's so sad that happened to a frat kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1394
01:02:32.251 --> 01:02:33.130
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1395
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.490
<v Speaker 3>there were a hazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a frat kid.</v>

1396
01:02:35.491 --> 01:02:37.470
<v Speaker 3>They made him drink water until he </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't drink anymore.</v>

1397
01:02:37.471 --> 01:02:38.320
<v Speaker 3>He fucking died too.</v>

1398
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:39.230
<v Speaker 4>Die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1399
01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.120
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1400
01:02:41.121 --> 01:02:41.860
<v Speaker 4>It's a terrible way.</v>

1401
01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.840
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird laws that protect people.</v>

1402
01:02:44.841 --> 01:02:47.210
<v Speaker 3>Cigarettes being legals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most preposterous</v>

1403
01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:52.220
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also remember like the impulse for </v>

1404
01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.351
<v Speaker 4>many people are taking psychedelics is </v>
<v Speaker 4>not to try to wipe out the universe,</v>

1405
01:02:55.141 --> 01:02:57.510
<v Speaker 4>but it's to try to go deeper into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe.</v>

1406
01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:02.660
<v Speaker 4>And so that means that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the jails right now and a lot of </v>

1407
01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:06.501
<v Speaker 4>people in the dungeons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had the same instincts is like a </v>

1408
01:03:06.501 --> 01:03:10.311
<v Speaker 4>lot of the great philosophers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just wanted to expand their mind </v>

1409
01:03:10.311 --> 01:03:11.280
<v Speaker 4>and understand a little bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe and they're in prison now.</v>

1410
01:03:11.281 --> 01:03:14.580
<v Speaker 4>They're imprisoned and so from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>prohibition,</v>

1411
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:19.581
<v Speaker 4>you're not just getting an inability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go enjoy a great fucking night at some </v>

1412
01:03:19.581 --> 01:03:22.260
<v Speaker 4>underground party or the inability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like have a great camping trip with your</v>

1413
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:23.730
<v Speaker 4>pals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's literally,</v>

1414
01:03:23.731 --> 01:03:28.731
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stifling evolution because God knows </v>

1415
01:03:28.731 --> 01:03:32.391
<v Speaker 4>what amazing thoughts people could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming up with if there was a regulated </v>

1416
01:03:32.791 --> 01:03:37.791
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics that and we got to explore </v>
<v Speaker 4>them to understand how to really use </v>

1417
01:03:37.791 --> 01:03:41.400
<v Speaker 4>them and how to really fucking a harness</v>
<v Speaker 4>them to make us smarter.</v>

1418
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:46.670
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is something that's the birthright </v>

1419
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:49.671
<v Speaker 4>of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All indigenous tribes have some form of </v>

1420
01:03:49.671 --> 01:03:52.611
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic that they take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like the ancient people of the </v>

1421
01:03:52.611 --> 01:03:55.971
<v Speaker 4>earth knew about this pot Iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet somehow in the modern age,</v>

1422
01:03:56.311 --> 01:04:01.311
<v Speaker 4>they're keeping us from this experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>that maybe is the thing that connected </v>

1423
01:04:01.311 --> 01:04:02.640
<v Speaker 4>the native Americans to the earth that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about in the beginning.</v>

1424
01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:07.850
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it is the thing that made people </v>
<v Speaker 4>not so fucking fixated on material </v>

1425
01:04:08.341 --> 01:04:09.300
<v Speaker 4>possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1426
01:04:09.301 --> 01:04:11.460
<v Speaker 4>but it's white.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a prohibition happening now.</v>

1427
01:04:11.461 --> 01:04:13.020
<v Speaker 4>It's the dark ages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1428
01:04:13.021 --> 01:04:18.021
<v Speaker 4>imagine if there was a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just some book and inside of it was </v>

1429
01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.070
<v Speaker 4>amazing information that will teach you </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to overcome your ego,</v>

1430
01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:22.890
<v Speaker 4>that will connect you with your brothers</v>
<v Speaker 4>and sisters around you.</v>

1431
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:28.100
<v Speaker 4>There's this amazing book and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>surrounded by a fence that the </v>

1432
01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:28.140
<v Speaker 4>governments are wrecked and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1433
01:04:28.141 --> 01:04:29.650
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't read that fucking book.</v>

1434
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.680
<v Speaker 4>Can't read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's illegal.</v>

1435
01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:33.750
<v Speaker 4>You read that book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to the dungeon.</v>

1436
01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:37.200
<v Speaker 4>If we catch you distributing this book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>copies of this book,</v>

1437
01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:39.690
<v Speaker 4>we put you in the dungeon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't make any sense,</v>

1438
01:04:39.691 --> 01:04:44.691
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why aren't they letting us read that </v>

1439
01:04:44.691 --> 01:04:46.191
<v Speaker 4>fucking book?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anyone who died on </v>

1440
01:04:46.191 --> 01:04:48.411
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anyone where anything bad </v>

1441
01:04:48.411 --> 01:04:48.411
<v Speaker 4>happen to them on mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody.</v>

1442
01:04:48.411 --> 01:04:49.080
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's out there,</v>

1443
01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:49.310
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1444
01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard that.</v>

1445
01:04:50.401 --> 01:04:53.060
<v Speaker 3>I've heard a lot of things bad on </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms.</v>

1446
01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:56.710
<v Speaker 3>All those people were all bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every person I've ever met that had like</v>

1447
01:04:56.711 --> 01:04:59.380
<v Speaker 3>a horrible trip on mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all had like psychological shit.</v>

1448
01:04:59.381 --> 01:05:00.040
<v Speaker 3>They were dealing with</v>

1449
01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:04.430
<v Speaker 4>five bad problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got sick.</v>

1450
01:05:04.431 --> 01:05:09.431
<v Speaker 4>I was shitting myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh well that's possibly food poisoning.</v>

1451
01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:15.140
<v Speaker 4>Most looks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bad trips I think are overdosing.</v>

1452
01:05:15.141 --> 01:05:20.141
<v Speaker 4>I think that's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an overdose of how much </v>

1453
01:05:20.141 --> 01:05:20.141
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms</v>

1454
01:05:20.141 --> 01:05:20.620
<v Speaker 8>you should have based on how much you </v>
<v Speaker 8>ate that day.</v>

1455
01:05:20.621 --> 01:05:21.820
<v Speaker 8>How much.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

1456
01:05:21.821 --> 01:05:26.821
<v Speaker 8>All the factors needs to be regulated </v>
<v Speaker 8>because then it can be dispensed like </v>

1457
01:05:26.821 --> 01:05:28.150
<v Speaker 8>synthetic I've,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but we're talking about,</v>

1458
01:05:28.151 --> 01:05:33.151
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the whole idea behind the fact that </v>

1459
01:05:33.151 --> 01:05:34.240
<v Speaker 8>these drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like cocaine are illegal,</v>

1460
01:05:34.241 --> 01:05:36.850
<v Speaker 8>is what keeps them from being impure.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Know everyone,</v>

1461
01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:38.470
<v Speaker 8>cuts them up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Everyone adds all this stuff to them.</v>

1462
01:05:38.471 --> 01:05:41.110
<v Speaker 8>You couldn't do that if it was sold by </v>
<v Speaker 8>Coca Cola.</v>

1463
01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.090
<v Speaker 8>Coco was selling cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sure you know,</v>

1464
01:05:43.091 --> 01:05:43.620
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>

1465
01:05:43.650 --> 01:05:46.510
<v Speaker 8>you would have to have the ingredients </v>
<v Speaker 8>listed right there on it.</v>

1466
01:05:46.511 --> 01:05:48.120
<v Speaker 8>You would know exactly what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You,</v>

1467
01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:49.870
<v Speaker 8>they would have to sell your actual </v>
<v Speaker 8>cocaine,</v>

1468
01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:52.720
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but when you buying it from some fucking</v>

1469
01:05:52.721 --> 01:05:53.770
<v Speaker 8>kid at a rave,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>

1470
01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:56.110
<v Speaker 8>he's calling it Mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hope he's right.</v>

1471
01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:57.670
<v Speaker 8>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're taking a chance.</v>

1472
01:05:57.671 --> 01:05:59.090
<v Speaker 8>You want to party,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you want to have a good time.</v>

1473
01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:01.830
<v Speaker 8>Who knows what the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like what your idea is,</v>

1474
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.700
<v Speaker 8>was talking about with the cocaine the </v>
<v Speaker 8>other day.</v>

1475
01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.050
<v Speaker 8>That's what I just said.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

1476
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.700
<v Speaker 8>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You don't even listening.</v>

1477
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.940
<v Speaker 8>That's what we were actually saying.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's the subject we were talking,</v>

1478
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:11.260
<v Speaker 8>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if I did,</v>

1479
01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:14.560
<v Speaker 8>if I had a time machine,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Rogan and I could go back in time,</v>

1480
01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:19.890
<v Speaker 8>one of my stops on the way back to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>crucifixion would be to fucking pick up </v>

1481
01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:25.140
<v Speaker 8>a cocaine laden bottle of Coca Cola.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Haven't you always wondered what that </v>

1482
01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.220
<v Speaker 8>was like to drink at cocaine?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Cocaine,</v>

1483
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.770
<v Speaker 8>coke,</v>
<v Speaker 8>do it.</v>

1484
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:30.080
<v Speaker 8>It's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1485
01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:32.620
<v Speaker 8>when we say cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is also.</v>

1486
01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:35.050
<v Speaker 8>We talked about this in the podcast or </v>
<v Speaker 8>stayed the coca leaf.</v>

1487
01:06:35.051 --> 01:06:37.210
<v Speaker 8>The chewing of the coca leaf has a very </v>
<v Speaker 8>complete.</v>

1488
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:41.380
<v Speaker 8>It's a very different reaction than I'm </v>
<v Speaker 8>eating and by the way,</v>

1489
01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.030
<v Speaker 8>a coca leaves are still in Coca Cola.</v>

1490
01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.970
<v Speaker 8>A lot of people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but yeah,</v>

1491
01:06:45.971 --> 01:06:47.410
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they still important.</v>

1492
01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.440
<v Speaker 8>Even though cocoa leaves are illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they still import coca leaves to using </v>

1493
01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.340
<v Speaker 8>Coca Cola.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I might be talking on my end.</v>

1494
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:56.530
<v Speaker 8>I think they changed the formula for </v>
<v Speaker 8>that for a long time ago.</v>

1495
01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.510
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is that when they showed it was like the</v>

1496
01:06:58.511 --> 01:07:00.230
<v Speaker 8>20th or something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1497
01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:00.910
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

1498
01:07:00.911 --> 01:07:02.350
<v Speaker 8>I think it was like a long,</v>
<v Speaker 8>long time ago.</v>

1499
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.450
<v Speaker 8>Not sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

1500
01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:07.990
<v Speaker 8>I'm not sure about that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but anyway,</v>

1501
01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:11.590
<v Speaker 8>the point is the coca leaf,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which,</v>

1502
01:07:11.591 --> 01:07:12.460
<v Speaker 8>which they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

1503
01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:13.030
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they had,</v>

1504
01:07:13.031 --> 01:07:14.710
<v Speaker 8>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that was an ingredient,</v>

1505
01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:19.920
<v Speaker 8>right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but were they using cocaine as an </v>

1506
01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:20.350
<v Speaker 8>ingredient or was it just the coca </v>
<v Speaker 8>leaves?</v>

1507
01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:21.480
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1508
01:07:21.481 --> 01:07:24.220
<v Speaker 8>it wasn't sherlock holmes addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 8>cocaine and those books.</v>

1509
01:07:24.221 --> 01:07:26.380
<v Speaker 8>I think it was a lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I thought it was morphine.</v>

1510
01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:28.280
<v Speaker 8>It wasn't a morphine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can't remember.</v>

1511
01:07:28.281 --> 01:07:28.880
<v Speaker 8>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1512
01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:34.140
<v Speaker 8>wider,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wider up used to go to the morphine </v>

1513
01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:34.140
<v Speaker 8>probably people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1514
01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:37.231
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and they had opium dens and I think </v>

1515
01:07:37.231 --> 01:07:39.630
<v Speaker 8>Freud was really into coke.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think there were like blasting </v>

1516
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.960
<v Speaker 8>themselves with coke everywhere and I </v>
<v Speaker 8>was totally illegal,</v>

1517
01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:42.760
<v Speaker 8>like no one,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it wasn't regulated back then.</v>

1518
01:07:42.761 --> 01:07:43.780
<v Speaker 8>As far as I know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

1519
01:07:43.790 --> 01:07:46.510
<v Speaker 8>I think you could at least get </v>
<v Speaker 8>prescriptions for it.</v>

1520
01:07:46.511 --> 01:07:51.511
<v Speaker 8>I've seen like cool all bought.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean if it's in fucking coke fits in </v>

1521
01:07:51.511 --> 01:07:52.120
<v Speaker 8>Coca Cola,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's illegal.</v>

1522
01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.000
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there is actual legal people.</v>

1523
01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:58.570
<v Speaker 8>Must've been a noxious back then.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Everyone's on coke.</v>

1524
01:07:58.571 --> 01:08:03.571
<v Speaker 8>It must've been the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Cocacola actually does have a legal </v>

1525
01:08:03.571 --> 01:08:05.890
<v Speaker 8>importation of the coca leaf.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm still.</v>

1526
01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:07.540
<v Speaker 8>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>coca,</v>

1527
01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:08.900
<v Speaker 8>coca,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Coca Cola.</v>

1528
01:08:08.901 --> 01:08:13.901
<v Speaker 8>The coke formula is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 8>closely guarded corporate secrets in </v>

1529
01:08:13.901 --> 01:08:15.890
<v Speaker 8>America.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The company can seeds that using a d,</v>

1530
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:21.070
<v Speaker 3>cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ised flavor essence in the coca leaves </v>

1531
01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:24.770
<v Speaker 3>is one of the few coke ingredients that </v>
<v Speaker 3>company will publicly acknowledged.</v>

1532
01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:29.510
<v Speaker 3>So they are using an actual abstract of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the coca leaf that has no cocaine in it.</v>

1533
01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:30.870
<v Speaker 4>So I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1534
01:08:30.871 --> 01:08:33.150
<v Speaker 4>I know that cocaine going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're extracting.</v>

1535
01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:34.820
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who do</v>

1536
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:39.550
<v Speaker 5>I saw goes to Elton John's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the cocaine in the world.</v>

1537
01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:45.450
<v Speaker 5>You imagine if Coca Cola turned out to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be the number one dealer and on Earth if</v>

1538
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:50.930
<v Speaker 5>they're d extracting cocaine from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where's it going?</v>

1539
01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:52.570
<v Speaker 5>Done right away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't even need it.</v>

1540
01:08:52.571 --> 01:08:55.290
<v Speaker 5>Even though the Chileans forget that </v>
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>

1541
01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.420
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're here to sell kids sugary shit that</v>

1542
01:08:58.421 --> 01:08:59.450
<v Speaker 5>makes your teeth rot out.</v>

1543
01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:04.980
<v Speaker 3>We're not here to kill anybody and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys actually Dr Pepper the whole time.</v>

1544
01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.160
<v Speaker 3>He's like scarface,</v>
<v Speaker 3>character of the Coca Cola company.</v>

1545
01:09:08.161 --> 01:09:11.160
<v Speaker 3>All you need to know about the weather </v>
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>

1546
01:09:11.161 --> 01:09:16.161
<v Speaker 3>they would make money off of things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is who's making money off </v>

1547
01:09:16.161 --> 01:09:17.670
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cigarettes are fucking for sure.</v>

1548
01:09:17.671 --> 01:09:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Killing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1549
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:22.260
<v Speaker 3>like almost a half a million people a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year in this country alone.</v>

1550
01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:27.930
<v Speaker 3>Our ideas about intoxication are so </v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre and baffling that somehow or </v>

1551
01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:32.061
<v Speaker 3>another we think that they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting us from something that </v>

1552
01:09:32.061 --> 01:09:35.481
<v Speaker 3>perturbs our state of consciousness that</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes us think about things in a </v>

1553
01:09:35.481 --> 01:09:36.360
<v Speaker 3>completely different way and possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>even hallucinate,</v>

1554
01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:41.040
<v Speaker 3>but some weird surge that you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of an almost immediate addiction</v>

1555
01:09:41.041 --> 01:09:46.041
<v Speaker 3>that you've acquired to some stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking burning plant that's soaked in </v>

1556
01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:48.750
<v Speaker 3>chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one even discusses it.</v>

1557
01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:50.790
<v Speaker 3>It never comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not at all.</v>

1558
01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:53.890
<v Speaker 3>No campaigns ever bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one ever promised.</v>

1559
01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:57.690
<v Speaker 3>People are promising bases on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Newt Gingrich got desperate and plump,</v>

1560
01:09:57.691 --> 01:10:00.990
<v Speaker 3>promised a base on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time he had a second term,</v>

1561
01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.930
<v Speaker 3>he threw a hail Mary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like based on the mood.</v>

1562
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:08.990
<v Speaker 3>No one ever says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to make cigarettes illegal and </v>

1563
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:10.050
<v Speaker 3>save.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our friends were dying a horrible death,</v>

1564
01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:15.410
<v Speaker 3>addicted to a terrible chemical that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sick company as profiting off,</v>

1565
01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:20.900
<v Speaker 3>and we need to really change the way we </v>
<v Speaker 3>look to change the way we look at this </v>

1566
01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:21.990
<v Speaker 3>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible scourge in America.</v>

1567
01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:22.830
<v Speaker 3>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1568
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:25.860
<v Speaker 3>not a single politician would ever make </v>
<v Speaker 3>that speech and meanwhile they did.</v>

1569
01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.870
<v Speaker 3>They'd want a dead in the fucking hotel </v>
<v Speaker 3>room somewhere,</v>

1570
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:32.910
<v Speaker 4>but meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if any anyone running for president </v>

1571
01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:35.731
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that psilocybin makes you </v>

1572
01:10:36.221 --> 01:10:41.221
<v Speaker 4>connect with the universe and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>you love the people around you more and </v>

1573
01:10:41.221 --> 01:10:44.911
<v Speaker 4>it gives you more of an experience of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>full life and reminds you of how small </v>

1574
01:10:44.911 --> 01:10:46.930
<v Speaker 4>you are in relation to everything out so</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't really God on it.</v>

1575
01:10:46.931 --> 01:10:50.680
<v Speaker 4>So I don't think it should be illegal if</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody said that.</v>

1576
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:54.420
<v Speaker 4>If a president said that right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Santorum said that,</v>

1577
01:10:54.421 --> 01:10:56.490
<v Speaker 4>or somebody said that they would never </v>
<v Speaker 4>get elected.</v>

1578
01:10:56.530 --> 01:10:57.970
<v Speaker 3>Did you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't.</v>

1579
01:10:57.971 --> 01:10:59.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only will.</v>

1580
01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:04.620
<v Speaker 3>The only way they would never get </v>
<v Speaker 3>elected is if they would never get </v>

1581
01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:04.620
<v Speaker 3>elected anyway because elections aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

1582
01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:06.130
<v Speaker 3>But could they change the public's </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness?</v>

1583
01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you got an eloquent guy,</v>

1584
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:11.890
<v Speaker 3>well the evidence John Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the recent John Hopkins University,</v>

1585
01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.520
<v Speaker 3>sure it would work a 20 year period of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1586
01:11:14.521 --> 01:11:19.521
<v Speaker 3>All these people that took mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 3>just once at a direct change in their </v>

1587
01:11:19.521 --> 01:11:20.030
<v Speaker 3>personality and improvement of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>

1588
01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.600
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course it shouldn't be illegal,</v>

1589
01:11:21.601 --> 01:11:26.601
<v Speaker 3>but I think that if someone was eloquent</v>
<v Speaker 3>and someone made sense in all other </v>

1590
01:11:26.601 --> 01:11:30.111
<v Speaker 3>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone was a bright person and they </v>

1591
01:11:30.111 --> 01:11:32.220
<v Speaker 3>can prove it with data and prove it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>an articulate and eloquent manner,</v>

1592
01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:35.040
<v Speaker 3>where it was compelling were what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were telling you was that,</v>

1593
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.360
<v Speaker 3>here's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1594
01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:41.540
<v Speaker 3>I know you're all associating drugs with</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a negative thing and the reason </v>

1595
01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:41.610
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>

1596
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:44.700
<v Speaker 3>It's intelligent to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most drugs and many,</v>

1597
01:11:44.701 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 3>many drugs can be very negative on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1598
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:52.870
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been sold a bill of goods on </v>

1599
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:54.420
<v Speaker 3>certain drugs and certain drugs are </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually good for you.</v>

1600
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.600
<v Speaker 3>Not only are they good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may be the whole reason we evolved </v>

1601
01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.891
<v Speaker 3>from fucking monkeys in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we been lied to and the companies </v>

1602
01:12:03.961 --> 01:12:08.130
<v Speaker 3>that keep us in order right now would </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to keep everything the way it is.</v>

1603
01:12:08.131 --> 01:12:11.010
<v Speaker 3>The reason being is they're profiting </v>
<v Speaker 3>off things being illegal.</v>

1604
01:12:11.011 --> 01:12:15.600
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of profit on drugs being </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal that are illegal currently.</v>

1605
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:20.750
<v Speaker 3>It's not as simple as they would just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sell them to and then they would make </v>

1606
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:21.660
<v Speaker 3>the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't they make it legal?</v>

1607
01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:27.010
<v Speaker 3>There is money to be made that will not </v>
<v Speaker 3>be available once psychedelic drugs or </v>

1608
01:12:27.241 --> 01:12:32.241
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things that are for </v>

1609
01:12:32.241 --> 01:12:32.370
<v Speaker 3>sale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially pharmaceutical drugs.</v>

1610
01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:37.580
<v Speaker 3>A huge amount that just making marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal would just squash the market for a</v>

1611
01:12:38.221 --> 01:12:43.221
<v Speaker 3>good percentage of pain relief and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Glaucoma medication reduces interocular </v>

1612
01:12:44.431 --> 01:12:47.820
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>P people on aids who have aids,</v>

1613
01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:48.280
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1614
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:53.550
<v Speaker 3>can eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on chemotherapy that have a hard </v>

1615
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:56.331
<v Speaker 3>time eating all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many drugs that are </v>

1616
01:12:56.331 --> 01:12:57.570
<v Speaker 3>prescribed for various elements that </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally would be out of business.</v>

1617
01:12:57.610 --> 01:12:58.160
<v Speaker 4>So and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1618
01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:01.490
<v Speaker 4>and so consider this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take it to the human level.</v>

1619
01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:06.610
<v Speaker 4>This is where it gets fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have access to certain mind states </v>

1620
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:11.390
<v Speaker 4>where you can bring back authentic </v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

1621
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:14.450
<v Speaker 4>They can help your life and the life of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people around you.</v>

1622
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:17.630
<v Speaker 4>And there's a possibility that if enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were having these mind states,</v>

1623
01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:22.810
<v Speaker 4>there might be an acceleration in </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology and acceleration and science </v>

1624
01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:26.381
<v Speaker 4>and acceleration and philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because we can't get these mind </v>

1625
01:13:26.381 --> 01:13:27.740
<v Speaker 4>states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't get these mind states.</v>

1626
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:30.740
<v Speaker 4>Things are slow and weird and dumb right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1627
01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:34.040
<v Speaker 4>And the reason we can't get it is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people can make more money.</v>

1628
01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:34.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1629
01:13:34.511 --> 01:13:36.940
<v Speaker 3>let me play devil's advocate please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First off,</v>

1630
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:39.970
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of hippies are fucking mooches.</v>

1631
01:13:39.971 --> 01:13:42.190
<v Speaker 3>They mooch off the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get welfare,</v>

1632
01:13:42.191 --> 01:13:44.500
<v Speaker 3>they get public aid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to pull their share.</v>

1633
01:13:44.501 --> 01:13:45.550
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to pull their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

1634
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:50.800
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people think that these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these experiences that you say that will</v>

1635
01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:51.880
<v Speaker 3>benefit people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

1636
01:13:51.881 --> 01:13:52.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's the evidence?</v>

1637
01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:57.430
<v Speaker 3>Where's the evidence of anybody finding </v>
<v Speaker 3>out anything worthwhile on,</v>

1638
01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.320
<v Speaker 3>on psychedelics?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terence Mckenna?</v>

1639
01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:01.240
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Francis Crick.</v>

1640
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:06.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a rumor after he died that was </v>

1641
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:06.460
<v Speaker 3>released as that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a deathbed confession.</v>

1642
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:12.560
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was good friends with a brave new </v>

1643
01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:12.560
<v Speaker 4>world out as Huxley is friends with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Huxley.</v>

1644
01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:12.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1645
01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:17.130
<v Speaker 8>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's true if you were friends with not </v>

1646
01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:17.130
<v Speaker 8>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but okay,</v>

1647
01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:17.560
<v Speaker 8>that's true that he took it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it doesn't mean the.</v>

1648
01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:18.290
<v Speaker 8>The,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

1649
01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:18.910
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

1650
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:24.150
<v Speaker 8>what the statement is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is that he discovered the double helix </v>

1651
01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:24.520
<v Speaker 8>strand.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He figured it out while he was on Lsd.</v>

1652
01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:28.150
<v Speaker 8>That's all anecdotal.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's all deathbed confessions.</v>

1653
01:14:28.151 --> 01:14:29.380
<v Speaker 8>He never said that anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's no.</v>

1654
01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:32.800
<v Speaker 8>It's not written anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So just in fairness,</v>

1655
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:35.260
<v Speaker 8>I don't think you can directly attribute</v>
<v Speaker 8>that to him.</v>

1656
01:14:35.410 --> 01:14:38.560
<v Speaker 8>I've looked at the sources for that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's possible that he said that,</v>

1657
01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:41.730
<v Speaker 8>but I don't think you can stay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can.</v>

1658
01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:43.510
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're like in a court of law.</v>

1659
01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:47.200
<v Speaker 8>I can't prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but being friends with Aldous Huxley,</v>

1660
01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:52.460
<v Speaker 8>a manual on his deathbed,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he had himself injected with like 750 </v>

1661
01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.820
<v Speaker 8>micrograms of Lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Being friends with that guy.</v>

1662
01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.600
<v Speaker 8>That's like being friends with you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You'll never haven't gotten stumped.</v>

1663
01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:57.770
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

1664
01:14:57.771 --> 01:14:58.150
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're not.</v>

1665
01:14:58.151 --> 01:14:59.830
<v Speaker 8>You're misunderstanding me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

1666
01:14:59.831 --> 01:15:02.980
<v Speaker 8>He probably did do LSD.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The question is,</v>

1667
01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:04.500
<v Speaker 8>what did he get out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>How do you,</v>

1668
01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:06.070
<v Speaker 8>how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>He didn't just hallucinate.</v>

1669
01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:07.550
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's no evidence.</v>

1670
01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:11.590
<v Speaker 8>There's no evidence that it helped them </v>
<v Speaker 8>in any way.</v>

1671
01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:17.220
<v Speaker 8>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not like they pulled some nothing </v>

1672
01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:17.220
<v Speaker 8>on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's nothing you can be like.</v>

1673
01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:17.860
<v Speaker 8>Look here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There is one guy,</v>

1674
01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:19.150
<v Speaker 8>Kerry,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Kary Mullis.</v>

1675
01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.200
<v Speaker 8>I'm kary Mullis.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was a Nobel prize winning chemist and</v>

1676
01:15:24.431 --> 01:15:29.431
<v Speaker 8>he said that LSD had helped him develop </v>
<v Speaker 8>a polymers chain reaction that helps </v>

1677
01:15:29.431 --> 01:15:31.810
<v Speaker 8>amplify,</v>
<v Speaker 8>amplify specific DNA sequences.</v>

1678
01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:34.030
<v Speaker 8>And he figured that out while I was on </v>
<v Speaker 8>acid.</v>

1679
01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:35.170
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's one.</v>

1680
01:15:35.650 --> 01:15:36.590
<v Speaker 8>So there's one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Can you.</v>

1681
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:39.310
<v Speaker 8>Can you read that again?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What he did here?</v>

1682
01:15:39.311 --> 01:15:44.311
<v Speaker 8>Here's the full thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>During a symposium held a for Albert </v>

1683
01:15:44.311 --> 01:15:48.660
<v Speaker 8>Hoffman,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hoffman revealed that he was told by </v>

1684
01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.791
<v Speaker 8>Nobel prize winning chemist,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Kary Mullis that LSD had helped him </v>

1685
01:15:50.791 --> 01:15:52.230
<v Speaker 8>develop the Pala polymers.</v>

1686
01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:57.300
<v Speaker 8>Pete hope I'm saying this right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>P O l y m e r a s e Dot polyamorous,</v>

1687
01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.800
<v Speaker 8>polyamorous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Anyway,</v>

1688
01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:04.830
<v Speaker 8>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 8>action that helps amplify specific DNA </v>

1689
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.830
<v Speaker 8>sequences.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What does that mean?</v>

1690
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:05.410
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm too stupid for that,</v>

1691
01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:06.730
<v Speaker 8>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

1692
01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:09.990
<v Speaker 8>the guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm Kari Moss even admitted a.</v>

1693
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.970
<v Speaker 8>What if I had not taken lsd ever?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would.</v>

1694
01:16:12.971 --> 01:16:15.440
<v Speaker 8>I still have invented PCR.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That was the method.</v>

1695
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:17.530
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I doubt it.</v>

1696
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.330
<v Speaker 8>I seriously doubt that's what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 8>saying,</v>

1697
01:16:19.331 --> 01:16:20.470
<v Speaker 8>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1698
01:16:20.471 --> 01:16:25.471
<v Speaker 8>There's a fucking group of people who've</v>
<v Speaker 8>got their fucking clause dug into the </v>

1699
01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:29.380
<v Speaker 8>force of evolution and they're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 8>hold it back.</v>

1700
01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:34.381
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But if all the people that have done </v>

1701
01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:36.091
<v Speaker 8>Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one fucking guy says he figured once </v>

1702
01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:38.280
<v Speaker 8>I've done lsd 100 times,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have not learned any new or not the </v>

1703
01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.240
<v Speaker 8>best example,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but have you learned,</v>

1704
01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:44.930
<v Speaker 8>have you learned something about </v>
<v Speaker 8>yourself personally?</v>

1705
01:16:44.970 --> 01:16:47.060
<v Speaker 8>Insight,</v>
<v Speaker 8>personal insight solution.</v>

1706
01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.180
<v Speaker 8>Personally member.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What I'm doing though,</v>

1707
01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.200
<v Speaker 8>I am playing devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm a republican with shiny shoes on </v>

1708
01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:58.080
<v Speaker 8>with black socks and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm the guy who was telling you that if </v>

1709
01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.820
<v Speaker 8>you buy drugs you support terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1710
01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:00.110
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

1711
01:17:00.170 --> 01:17:01.660
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You told me one guy,</v>

1712
01:17:01.661 --> 01:17:06.661
<v Speaker 8>one guy says he invented a PCR method,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which you don't even understand why I </v>

<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.980
<v Speaker 8>Jimmy Hendrix is more heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wasn't even heroin and cocaine,</v>

1726
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:39.050

<v Speaker 8>Wasn't he a heroin guy?</v>

1727
01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:43.100
<v Speaker 8>Purple Haze.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's purple haze.</v>

1728
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:48.160
<v Speaker 8>Isn't that pot dude?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jimi Hendrix was so into fucking LSD or </v>

1729
01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:48.200
<v Speaker 8>purple haze.</v>

1730
01:17:48.201 --> 01:17:51.670
<v Speaker 8>Is that it is now purple haze was </v>
<v Speaker 8>asking.</v>

1731
01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:53.700
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm sure he did ask it.</v>

1732
01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:58.720
<v Speaker 8>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but do you think that that's why he was </v>

1733
01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:58.720
<v Speaker 8>so good?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1734
01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.690
<v Speaker 8>wasn't he like really good when he was a</v>
<v Speaker 8>bad ass?</v>

1735
01:17:59.691 --> 01:18:02.050
<v Speaker 8>Fucking gets helped him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But again,</v>

1736
01:18:03.250 --> 01:18:08.250
<v Speaker 8>I know you're playing devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I'm being devil's advocate is the </v>

1737
01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:09.170
<v Speaker 8>same thing as being friends with a </v>
<v Speaker 8>pedophile.</v>

1738
01:18:09.171 --> 01:18:10.430
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't want to be devil's advocate.</v>

1739
01:18:10.431 --> 01:18:15.431
<v Speaker 8>It's the worst force in the universe and</v>
<v Speaker 8>always represents everything evil and </v>

1740
01:18:15.431 --> 01:18:15.431
<v Speaker 8>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

1741
01:18:15.431 --> 01:18:20.160
<v Speaker 8>I take the side of an argument that </v>
<v Speaker 8>doesn't currently exist with this table </v>

1742
01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:20.330
<v Speaker 8>because I'm sure somebody is screaming </v>
<v Speaker 8>it out on twitter,</v>

1743
01:18:20.331 --> 01:18:20.480
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1744
01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.090
<v Speaker 8>Devil's advocate is I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1745
01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.040
<v Speaker 8>I think for sure psychedelics can,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1746
01:18:26.210 --> 01:18:31.210
<v Speaker 8>can help people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But what I think it is is I think </v>

1747
01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:34.180
<v Speaker 8>essentially we have access to super </v>
<v Speaker 8>computers and there's no instruction </v>

1748
01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:38.771
<v Speaker 8>manuals laying around and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 8>teachers to teach her how to use these </v>

1749
01:18:38.771 --> 01:18:42.281
<v Speaker 8>things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So a lot of people are getting great </v>

1750
01:18:42.281 --> 01:18:44.051
<v Speaker 8>results and they're all scattered and </v>
<v Speaker 8>all over the poor and they're mixed in </v>

1751
01:18:44.051 --> 01:18:45.130
<v Speaker 8>with psychosis and bad trips and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 8>of fucking freaky,</v>

1752
01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:50.200
<v Speaker 8>freaky things that have happened to </v>
<v Speaker 8>people and they've taken the wrong shit </v>

1753
01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:50.200
<v Speaker 8>and they got ahold of a fake computer.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1754
01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:54.791
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of people that are in that</v>
<v Speaker 8>is because there's lack of regulation </v>

1755
01:18:54.791 --> 01:18:58.691
<v Speaker 8>because there's a lack of understanding </v>
<v Speaker 8>because there's a lack of appreciation </v>

1756
01:18:58.691 --> 01:19:01.400
<v Speaker 8>for the true effects as human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is absolutely preposterous.</v>

1757
01:19:01.401 --> 01:19:04.220
<v Speaker 8>It's so many people will tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Carrie,</v>

1758
01:19:04.221 --> 01:19:09.221
<v Speaker 8>most guy or whether Francis Crick was </v>
<v Speaker 8>telling you the truth or whether you're </v>

1759
01:19:09.221 --> 01:19:12.641
<v Speaker 8>telling me the truth or I'm telling you </v>
<v Speaker 8>the truth or any of us that have had </v>

1760
01:19:12.641 --> 01:19:12.770
<v Speaker 8>really positive experiences.</v>

1761
01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:18.160
<v Speaker 8>There's there's way too many people that</v>
<v Speaker 8>are saying that folks can benefit from </v>

1762
01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:18.710
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for it to stay illegal.</v>

1763
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:23.360
<v Speaker 8>The people that are stopping it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they don't make any more sense than us.</v>

1764
01:19:23.361 --> 01:19:25.360
<v Speaker 8>It's not like they're.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're.</v>

1765
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:30.370
<v Speaker 8>They're really wise and cautious and </v>
<v Speaker 8>noble and loving overlords that want to </v>

1766
01:19:31.521 --> 01:19:35.080
<v Speaker 8>protect you from your own folly.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That is not what's going on because they</v>

1767
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:37.100
<v Speaker 8>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're talking and ignorant statements.</v>

1768
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:38.570
<v Speaker 8>Medically.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's ignorance.</v>

1769
01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:40.550
<v Speaker 8>There's no evidence to back up what </v>
<v Speaker 8>they're saying.</v>

1770
01:19:40.551 --> 01:19:44.330
<v Speaker 8>There's no reason that it makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 8>and then when you start throwing numbers</v>

1771
01:19:44.331 --> 01:19:49.331
<v Speaker 8>at their face like the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the amount of nonviolent drug offenders </v>

1772
01:19:49.331 --> 01:19:50.840
<v Speaker 8>that are in jail and how preposterous it</v>
<v Speaker 8>is that our society exists where a bunch</v>

1773
01:19:50.841 --> 01:19:55.841
<v Speaker 8>of people were doing what they want to </v>
<v Speaker 8>do that doesn't hurt anybody else and </v>

1774
01:19:55.841 --> 01:19:55.841
<v Speaker 8>someone decides to lock them in a cage </v>
<v Speaker 8>for it.</v>

1775
01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:57.980
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that person is who's doing more harm.</v>

1776
01:19:58.190 --> 01:20:03.190
<v Speaker 8>The guy was smoking pot,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or the person who locked him in a </v>

1777
01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:05.411
<v Speaker 8>fucking cage destroys their life and </v>
<v Speaker 8>does it because it's written on paper </v>

1778
01:20:05.411 --> 01:20:05.770
<v Speaker 8>somewhere that that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1779
01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:07.160
<v Speaker 8>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a destructive.</v>

1780
01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:08.580
<v Speaker 8>The law</v>

1781
01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:11.640
<v Speaker 3>becomes a destructive force in society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the drug.</v>

1782
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.070
<v Speaker 3>When you say drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill people and drugs,</v>

1783
01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:17.610
<v Speaker 3>drugs are responsible for a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in jail right now.</v>

1784
01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:19.860
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't do drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You won't get locked up.</v>

1785
01:20:19.861 --> 01:20:20.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1786
01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:20.700
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1787
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:25.790
<v Speaker 3>Don't put people in cages because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't agree with you because they like </v>

1788
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:26.730
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like it so much.</v>

1789
01:20:26.731 --> 01:20:31.731
<v Speaker 3>They're willing to risk freedom because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they found themselves in some sort of a </v>

1790
01:20:31.731 --> 01:20:35.091
<v Speaker 3>situation when they're in an environment</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have no control over </v>

1791
01:20:35.091 --> 01:20:35.091
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were born into this,</v>

1792
01:20:35.091 --> 01:20:37.590
<v Speaker 3>they didn't ask to be dropped into this </v>
<v Speaker 3>preposterous,</v>

1793
01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:40.080
<v Speaker 3>illogical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsensical,</v>

1794
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:43.170
<v Speaker 3>ridiculously lopsided and corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>

1795
01:20:43.290 --> 01:20:48.290
<v Speaker 3>and you just accept them to comply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just expect them to comply with </v>

1796
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:53.181
<v Speaker 3>these stupid fucking things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>written down on paper that everybody </v>

1797
01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:53.181
<v Speaker 3>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Makes no sense.</v>

1798
01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:53.181
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1799
01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.340
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The laws are the problem.</v>

1800
01:20:56.430 --> 01:21:00.420
<v Speaker 3>The laws are destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The laws are anti evolutionary.</v>

1801
01:21:00.421 --> 01:21:04.470
<v Speaker 3>The laws are they're anti enlightenment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

1802
01:21:04.471 --> 01:21:05.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not pot.</v>

1803
01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:08.400
<v Speaker 3>It's not mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the laws against pot and mushrooms.</v>

1804
01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:11.250
<v Speaker 3>Those are a devastating aspect of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

1805
01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:15.810
<v Speaker 3>Those are not the fucking drugs you </v>
<v Speaker 3>dummies missed it.</v>

1806
01:21:15.811 --> 01:21:17.860
<v Speaker 3>You missed the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not protecting anybody.</v>

1807
01:21:17.861 --> 01:21:19.860
<v Speaker 3>You fucks and anybody that hasn't done </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs,</v>

<v Speaker 3>fucking for sure you shouldn't be a cop.</v>

1809

<v Speaker 3>No Way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>with a gun and making decisions and </v>

<v Speaker 3>You've never had any.</v>

1812
01:21:30.121 --> 01:21:33.600

<v Speaker 3>alien intelligence.</v>

1813
01:21:33.601 --> 01:21:38.601
<v Speaker 3>You've never had some objective outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>the body experience analyzing all this </v>

1814

<v Speaker 3>shitty aspects of your own life.</v>

1818
01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:56.360
<v Speaker 3>After another way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you scream insults at each other and </v>

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:11.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting someone to respond to you,</v>

1827
01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.700
<v Speaker 3>getting somebody you know because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1828
01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:15.010
<v Speaker 3>you realized that being a cunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1829
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:17.070
<v Speaker 3>makes people not like you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's how you grow up,</v>

1830
01:22:17.290 --> 01:22:22.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of like seeing it in one big </v>

1831
01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:22.290
<v Speaker 3>burst,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all leaders,</v>

1832
01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:23.040
<v Speaker 3>all cops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all teachers,</v>

1833
01:22:23.490 --> 01:22:28.490
<v Speaker 3>all of them should have a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience or they don't know what the </v>

1834
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:28.980
<v Speaker 3>fuck they're talking about as a grown </v>
<v Speaker 3>adult.</v>

1835
01:22:28.981 --> 01:22:30.630
<v Speaker 3>If you haven't had a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

1836
01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I look at you like you're some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>an infant.</v>

1837
01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:38.720
<v Speaker 3>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Y'All look at you like your infant </v>

1838
01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.761
<v Speaker 3>toddler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I look at you like form </v>

1839
01:22:40.761 --> 01:22:40.761
<v Speaker 3>illiterates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1840
01:22:40.761 --> 01:22:41.820
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is like a form of like awareness,</v>

1841
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:42.930
<v Speaker 3>illiteracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1842
01:22:42.931 --> 01:22:43.610
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

1843
01:22:43.650 --> 01:22:44.910
<v Speaker 3>that's a great way to put it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1844
01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>illiteracy.</v>

1845
01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:51.680
<v Speaker 3>And it's sad that for some reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're keeping as they're keeping so </v>

1846
01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:51.920
<v Speaker 3>many people illiterate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the practice.</v>

1847
01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:53.700
<v Speaker 3>They are literate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they're doing it.</v>

1848
01:22:53.701 --> 01:22:58.701
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are suffering under their own </v>

1849
01:22:58.701 --> 01:22:58.701
<v Speaker 3>control and their own or most of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

1850
01:22:58.701 --> 01:23:01.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a Texas judge who just </v>
<v Speaker 3>got arrested for fucking smoking weed.</v>

1851
01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:03.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody turned them in.</v>

1852
01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:07.600
<v Speaker 3>The hotel think it's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think things are gonna Change,</v>

1853
01:23:07.601 --> 01:23:12.601
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're lying saying this is the </v>

1854
01:23:12.601 --> 01:23:12.601
<v Speaker 3>third year letting the studies happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

1855
01:23:12.601 --> 01:23:12.601
<v Speaker 3>And if they're letting the studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen again,</v>

1856
01:23:12.601 --> 01:23:13.930
<v Speaker 3>there's some reason behind that.</v>

1857
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:18.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean the studies are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're allowing them to happen for the </v>

1858
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:21.811
<v Speaker 3>first time and I think 30 or 40 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're opening them up because </v>

1859
01:23:21.811 --> 01:23:23.350
<v Speaker 3>government is dangerously suppressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerously suppressive.</v>

1860
01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:28.380
<v Speaker 3>And not so much with civil liberties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a or rather with medical marijuana </v>

1861
01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:29.770
<v Speaker 3>and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's because it's democratic.</v>

1862
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:31.840
<v Speaker 3>When the ball goes in the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 3>court,</v>

1863
01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:34.550
<v Speaker 3>think about how much power has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>given to the government under this,</v>

1864
01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.810
<v Speaker 3>this democratic regime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we got another Bush Cheney,</v>

1865
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:42.850
<v Speaker 3>an office and they started cracking down</v>
<v Speaker 3>like John Ashcroft did on the medical </v>

1866
01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:44.170
<v Speaker 3>marijuana places and using losing </v>
<v Speaker 3>blackwater to come in,</v>

1867
01:23:44.171 --> 01:23:49.171
<v Speaker 3>mercenaries will fucking machine guns on</v>
<v Speaker 3>their hips and taking all the pot and </v>

1868
01:23:49.171 --> 01:23:49.600
<v Speaker 3>money away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that shit starts happening again,</v>

1869
01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.680
<v Speaker 3>think about how much power Obama has </v>
<v Speaker 3>given the government.</v>

1870
01:23:53.710 --> 01:23:54.740
<v Speaker 3>Its ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1871
01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:57.520
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really disgusting and preposterous.</v>

1872
01:23:57.730 --> 01:23:59.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the Huffington,</v>

1873
01:23:59.050 --> 01:24:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Huffington Post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an article by this guy named </v>

1874
01:24:04.050 --> 01:24:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim Garrison,</v>

1875
01:24:04.050 --> 01:24:08.860
<v Speaker 3>and it's martial law by executive order </v>
<v Speaker 3>not to be confused with Jim Garrison </v>

1876
01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.570
<v Speaker 3>that thought that Lee Harvey Oswald </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't kill Kennedy.</v>

1877
01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:12.610
<v Speaker 3>You remember that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The prosecutor.</v>

1878
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:13.800
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1879
01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:14.810
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1880
01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he passed the National Defense </v>

1881
01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1882
01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:23.960
<v Speaker 3>the NDA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new executive order called um,</v>

1883
01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:25.210
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1884
01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:29.050
<v Speaker 3>national defense resources preparedness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>executive order.</v>

1885
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:34.550
<v Speaker 3>And it does the country as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the 2012 national defense </v>

1886
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:35.980
<v Speaker 3>authorization act to the constitution in</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

1887
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:40.750
<v Speaker 3>completely eviscerate any due process or</v>
<v Speaker 3>judicial oversight for any action by the</v>

1888
01:24:40.751 --> 01:24:43.420
<v Speaker 3>government deemed in the interest of </v>
<v Speaker 3>national security.</v>

1889
01:24:43.421 --> 01:24:45.220
<v Speaker 3>So they can just say something's </v>
<v Speaker 3>national security.</v>

1890
01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Essentially we're under martial law like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can just say,</v>

1891
01:24:48.150 --> 01:24:50.320
<v Speaker 3>and it's up to the government now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

1892
01:24:50.321 --> 01:24:52.420
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the checks and balances that were put in</v>

1893
01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:55.300
<v Speaker 3>place by the constitution to ensure that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be no corruption.</v>

1894
01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:59.230
<v Speaker 3>There would be no ultimate power </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupting ultimately.</v>

1895
01:24:59.260 --> 01:24:59.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1896
01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:02.200
<v Speaker 3>they've removed all that shit and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1897
01:25:02.201 --> 01:25:03.340
<v Speaker 3>right now everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1898
01:25:03.341 --> 01:25:05.140
<v Speaker 3>but you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's no one's dying.</v>

1899
01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:06.190
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing's happening.</v>

1900
01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:11.640
<v Speaker 3>The people that you say yes to today may</v>
<v Speaker 3>not be the people you say yes to 10 </v>

1901
01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.300
<v Speaker 3>years from now or 20 years from now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these laws are crazy.</v>

1902
01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:16.990
<v Speaker 3>These laws are that we might as well be </v>
<v Speaker 3>living in fucking North Korea and that's</v>

1903
01:25:16.991 --> 01:25:19.360
<v Speaker 3>not ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not an exaggeration.</v>

1904
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:23.110
<v Speaker 3>These are unconstitutional laws and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to stop.</v>

1905
01:25:23.111 --> 01:25:28.111
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to go more and more and </v>

1906
01:25:28.111 --> 01:25:28.780
<v Speaker 3>more and more control until ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 3>the government,</v>

1907
01:25:28.781 --> 01:25:31.750
<v Speaker 3>which is by the way a approved the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>of sending drones.</v>

1908
01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:34.600
<v Speaker 3>They're going to within the bike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 12,</v>

1909
01:25:34.601 --> 01:25:37.180
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have a 2020 rather.</v>

1910
01:25:37.181 --> 01:25:39.430
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>drones in the sky,</v>

1911
01:25:39.431 --> 01:25:41.260
<v Speaker 3>but North America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

1912
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:43.510
<v Speaker 3>Come up constantly watching everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

1913
01:25:43.630 --> 01:25:44.110
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you.</v>

1914
01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:47.500
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that youtube video of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>swarms of quadcopters?</v>

1915
01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:48.790
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1916
01:25:48.970 --> 01:25:50.860
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look that at Google Quadra.</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1918
01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>

1919
01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:57.400
<v Speaker 3>So there are these things called quadra </v>
<v Speaker 3>copters that they're working on that are</v>

1920
01:25:57.401 --> 01:26:00.010
<v Speaker 3>just like exactly like the toys that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

1921
01:26:00.011 --> 01:26:02.950
<v Speaker 3>but much smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These fucking things man,</v>

1922
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:03.830
<v Speaker 3>they can like</v>

1923
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:09.040
<v Speaker 4>they move information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says video of them flying </v>

1924
01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.220
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just this swarm of tiny little nano or a</v>

1925
01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:15.280
<v Speaker 4>tiny quadra copters they can like they </v>
<v Speaker 4>give like turned sideways to go through </v>

1926
01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.050
<v Speaker 4>windows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1927
01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:18.030
<v Speaker 4>they can go anywhere man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So and.</v>

1928
01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.660
<v Speaker 4>But the scary thing that I never </v>
<v Speaker 4>considered was that they can fucking fly</v>

1929
01:26:21.670 --> 01:26:26.670
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where it gets weird when you </v>

1930
01:26:26.670 --> 01:26:29.261
<v Speaker 4>imagine like just seeing like a swarm of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things descending around your </v>

1931
01:26:29.261 --> 01:26:31.250
<v Speaker 4>house or fluids checking you out on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>street.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We're just walking down the street and </v>

1933
01:26:36.251 --> 01:26:38.321
<v Speaker 4>they come and like buzzing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do a quick facial scan to get your </v>

1934
01:26:38.321 --> 01:26:41.711
<v Speaker 4>fucking face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Match it up with like whatever </v>

<v Speaker 3>It's on its way out.</v>

1940
01:26:48.491 --> 01:26:53.491
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these consultant running things are </v>

1941
01:26:53.491 --> 01:26:53.491
<v Speaker 3>gonna have so much more power than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>average citizen.</v>

1942
01:26:53.491 --> 01:26:58.471
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be under the rule of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressive government that has the law </v>

1943
01:26:58.471 --> 01:26:59.800
<v Speaker 3>on their side because they changed all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck on paper.</v>

1944
01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:04.920
<v Speaker 3>They changed all the stupid shit that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>written down that allows them to do </v>

1945
01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.501
<v Speaker 3>cunty things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They changed it all and they put it all </v>

1946
01:27:07.501 --> 01:27:09.871
<v Speaker 3>in their defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And essentially what they did is the </v>

1947
01:27:09.871 --> 01:27:10.330
<v Speaker 3>United States is now under martial law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no emergency,</v>

1948
01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:15.510
<v Speaker 3>no emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to have a national </v>

1949
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.510
<v Speaker 3>emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did just be under martial law.</v>

1950
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:17.230
<v Speaker 3>Now we're just under martial law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1951
01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is going on?</v>

1952
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Part of it has got to be because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>losing control.</v>

1953
01:27:22.211 --> 01:27:25.300
<v Speaker 3>That's got to be part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel like the Internet and all this</v>

1954
01:27:25.450 --> 01:27:27.530
<v Speaker 3>anonymous shit and the hackers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>occupied.</v>

1955
01:27:27.531 --> 01:27:28.930
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

1956
01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Spell it out for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell him.</v>

1957
01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.150
<v Speaker 4>I think it's q u,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a d,</v>

1958
01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:37.640
<v Speaker 4>r a copter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

1959
01:27:37.710 --> 01:27:39.260
<v Speaker 4>Quadra Copter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>swarm.</v>

1960
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:42.740
<v Speaker 4>Maybe someone will tweet it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone tweeted it to me.</v>

1961
01:27:42.741 --> 01:27:45.020
<v Speaker 4>It freaked me out for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I showed it to.</v>

1962
01:27:45.230 --> 01:27:48.410
<v Speaker 4>I showed it to Eddie Bravo at the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 4>and his face went white.</v>

1963
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:50.150
<v Speaker 4>He just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1964
01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Swarm of Nana quadros.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1965
01:27:52.861 --> 01:27:55.340
<v Speaker 3>It's Nano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quad raters.</v>

1966
01:27:55.390 --> 01:27:56.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There we go.</v>

1967
01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

1968
01:27:57.670 --> 01:28:00.820
<v Speaker 4>Just watch it gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just one of these fucking things.</v>

1969
01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:01.720
<v Speaker 4>Get Ready,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1970
01:28:01.721 --> 01:28:03.730
<v Speaker 4>Those things are probably going to eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>your baby one day.</v>

1971
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:07.660
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sound.</v>

1972
01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.420
<v Speaker 4>When you hear that sound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know you're about to get busted.</v>

1973
01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:17.740
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

1974
01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:19.920
<v Speaker 3>They just fly around and maneuver.</v>

1975
01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:20.800
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1976
01:28:20.850 --> 01:28:24.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm surprised you haven't seen these </v>
<v Speaker 4>vehicles can fly as a formation.</v>

1977
01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:30.250
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is terrifying.</v>

1978
01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.060
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna sound like Nascar all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

1979
01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:36.920
<v Speaker 3>We're living in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really fun.</v>

1980
01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:40.070
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really nuts.</v>

1981
01:28:41.710 --> 01:28:42.220
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1982
01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:50.280
<v Speaker 4>This is a method to transition between </v>
<v Speaker 4>formations in three d</v>

1983
01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:59.020
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to see this because what you </v>

1984
01:28:59.020 --> 01:28:59.410
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're not seeing is these guys are</v>

1985
01:28:59.411 --> 01:29:04.411
<v Speaker 3>moving in perfect geometrical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They move in these formations and </v>

1986
01:29:04.411 --> 01:29:05.140
<v Speaker 3>they're showing it from overhead and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1987
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:08.610
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their precision is incredible.</v>

1988
01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.830
<v Speaker 3>This is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>

1989
01:29:10.831 --> 01:29:13.580
<v Speaker 3>This is only like version one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1990
01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.010
<v Speaker 3>this is like the first iphone gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller and smaller.</v>

1991
01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:22.280
<v Speaker 3>This is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how long they can stay in the </v>

1992
01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:22.280
<v Speaker 3>air for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

1993
01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:22.320
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're moving in a figure eight,</v>

1994
01:29:22.321 --> 01:29:23.440
<v Speaker 3>a perfect figure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight.</v>

1995
01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:26.940
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is spectacular.</v>

1996
01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:29.040
<v Speaker 3>This is really scary</v>

1997
01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:30.330
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scary Shit,</v>

1998
01:29:30.331 --> 01:29:31.620
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now look at them building.</v>

1999
01:29:31.621 --> 01:29:35.160
<v Speaker 4>Look up quadra copter building a </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure.</v>

2000
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:37.530
<v Speaker 4>Build Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2001
01:29:37.531 --> 01:29:41.220
<v Speaker 4>They can actually pick shit up and start</v>
<v Speaker 4>gluing it built.</v>

2002
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:43.860
<v Speaker 4>They can actually build structures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

2003
01:29:43.861 --> 01:29:45.660
<v Speaker 4>That's what Kurzweil was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2004
01:29:45.661 --> 01:29:50.661
<v Speaker 4>because when those things shrink down </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough so that they can like imagine </v>

2005
01:29:50.661 --> 01:29:53.901
<v Speaker 4>like just a pile of fucking legos and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>shitload of those fucking things and </v>

2006
01:29:53.941 --> 01:29:57.030
<v Speaker 4>they could actually form matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where it gets really cool.</v>

2007
01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:02.940
<v Speaker 4>Think about that forming matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where it gets weird when you've </v>

2008
01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:06.891
<v Speaker 4>got a computer directing swarms of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>things to construct architecture that </v>

2009
01:30:07.261 --> 01:30:09.000
<v Speaker 4>humans couldn't even make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2010
01:30:09.001 --> 01:30:14.001
<v Speaker 4>like weird fucking geometries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That can only happen when a computers </v>

2011
01:30:14.001 --> 01:30:15.810
<v Speaker 4>and control the building process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it ever gets to that point,</v>

2012
01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.820
<v Speaker 4>it might be the just start fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>killing people.</v>

2013
01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:19.620
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's funny thing man.</v>

2014
01:30:19.621 --> 01:30:21.620
<v Speaker 4>People always say that about computers </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're like,</v>

2015
01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:23.700
<v Speaker 4>they're just going to kill us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I guess it's.</v>

2016
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:25.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>computers.</v>

2017
01:30:25.041 --> 01:30:30.041
<v Speaker 4>It would be the things controlling them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like people automatically assume when </v>

2018
01:30:30.041 --> 01:30:31.620
<v Speaker 4>the machine inevitably wakes up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2019
01:30:31.650 --> 01:30:33.480
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna want to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to kill us,</v>

2020
01:30:33.481 --> 01:30:33.780
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2021
01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.290
<v Speaker 3>plague,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2022
01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:40.300
<v Speaker 3>if it looked at the environment it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>living in and realize that there's </v>

2023
01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.410
<v Speaker 3>massive overpopulating entity that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>spilling all.</v>

2024
01:30:41.411 --> 01:30:46.411
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit into the sea and eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the fucking animals that live in it </v>

2025
01:30:46.411 --> 01:30:47.140
<v Speaker 3>and then they will just calculate how </v>
<v Speaker 3>long can this last?</v>

2026
01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't at this rate,</v>

2027
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:50.670
<v Speaker 3>so they'll just start eating the country</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2028
01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:52.070
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking work.</v>

2029
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:54.250
<v Speaker 3>It'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we would eliminate.</v>

2030
01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:55.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even.</v>

2031
01:30:56.010 --> 01:30:59.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't people out of the sky just </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious gets sucked out of the sky.</v>

2032
01:30:59.970 --> 01:31:02.350
<v Speaker 3>I get they're watching and watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2033
01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:07.380
<v Speaker 3>That's a little bit that machines are </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching everything and when you litter </v>

2034
01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:07.600
<v Speaker 3>and when you're a shithead and when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>beat,</v>

2035
01:31:07.601 --> 01:31:10.180
<v Speaker 3>your wife just gets sucked out of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy Won't get down voted.</v>

2036
01:31:10.181 --> 01:31:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a certain number of negatives.</v>

2037
01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:17.360
<v Speaker 4>Downvotes like on Reddit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get as a person has certain </v>

2038
01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.290
<v Speaker 4>number they carry you in this phase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rub points.</v>

2039
01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.450
<v Speaker 4>If you get blocked by a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 4>of people,</v>

2040
01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.080
<v Speaker 4>just them building this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

2041
01:31:24.210 --> 01:31:26.670
<v Speaker 4>crazy fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2042
01:31:26.671 --> 01:31:31.671
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that they're building is this </v>

2043
01:31:31.671 --> 01:31:32.490
<v Speaker 4>enormous like lego building that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>really cool looking.</v>

2044
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.250
<v Speaker 4>That was blocks have glue on them or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

2045
01:31:35.251 --> 01:31:40.251
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just the beginning of that shit </v>

2046
01:31:40.251 --> 01:31:40.950
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That didn't exist 20 years ago.</v>

2047
01:31:40.951 --> 01:31:43.020
<v Speaker 4>There was no no hope of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty years ago,</v>

2048
01:31:43.050 --> 01:31:45.750
<v Speaker 4>20 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do check this out?</v>

2049
01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:48.180
<v Speaker 4>If you ever seen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've ever seen the video of that,</v>

2050
01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:51.150
<v Speaker 4>there a machine that you can take to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>desert that someone made.</v>

2051
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:54.990
<v Speaker 4>It's solar powered because there's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much energy and it focuses the energy of</v>

2052
01:31:54.991 --> 01:31:58.890
<v Speaker 4>the sun and the desert to turn sand into</v>
<v Speaker 4>blocks.</v>

2053
01:31:59.050 --> 01:31:59.950
<v Speaker 4>It can burn</v>

2054
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:03.550
<v Speaker 8>sanding blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so now imagine this combined,</v>

2055
01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:08.760
<v Speaker 8>those fucking things with solar panels </v>
<v Speaker 8>and a thing that can infinitely can use </v>

2056
01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.690
<v Speaker 8>an infinite amount of sand in the desert</v>
<v Speaker 8>to make blocks.</v>

2057
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:15.870
<v Speaker 8>Those things could fly out in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking desert and make infinitely </v>

2058
01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:17.260
<v Speaker 8>gigantic structures with endless fucking</v>
<v Speaker 8>energy.</v>

2059
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:22.440
<v Speaker 8>Just the combination of those two </v>
<v Speaker 8>technologies at the rudimentary level </v>

2060
01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:22.600
<v Speaker 8>that they're at now,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if we can fucking figure out how to make</v>

2061
01:32:22.601 --> 01:32:25.090
<v Speaker 8>them solar power.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Solar is really interesting.</v>

2062
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:28.030
<v Speaker 8>It's like it's kind of hit a wall and a </v>
<v Speaker 8>lot of ways.</v>

2063
01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.620
<v Speaker 8>So what are you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what are you doing?</v>

2064
01:32:29.770 --> 01:32:34.760
<v Speaker 8>I googled a solar power sandbox and it </v>
<v Speaker 8>came up with minecraft.</v>

2065
01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:40.460
<v Speaker 8>Solar power is not really strong enough </v>
<v Speaker 8>for a lot of shit right now for most </v>

2066
01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:43.981
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Can't like have all their electricity </v>

2067
01:32:43.981 --> 01:32:43.981
<v Speaker 8>through solar power.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You use like a lot of people use.</v>

2068
01:32:43.981 --> 01:32:48.781
<v Speaker 8>Like I have a friend that uses a </v>
<v Speaker 8>combination of solar and wind and he </v>

2069
01:32:48.781 --> 01:32:48.781
<v Speaker 8>actually developed enough from the.</v>

2070
01:32:48.781 --> 01:32:50.470
<v Speaker 8>He lives in Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He develops enough from nothing.</v>

2071
01:32:50.471 --> 01:32:55.070
<v Speaker 8>He actually sells it back to the grid,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which I don't know.</v>

2072
01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:56.350
<v Speaker 8>Strange.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How do you do that?</v>

2073
01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:57.390
<v Speaker 8>I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2074
01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:58.900
<v Speaker 8>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How do you do what?</v>

2075
01:32:58.901 --> 01:33:01.810
<v Speaker 8>Sell Electricity back.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They pay him.</v>

2076
01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:06.840
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's a meter on it that regulates it </v>

2077
01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.941
<v Speaker 8>going in.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But you could also have it fitted so it </v>

2078
01:33:08.941 --> 01:33:08.941
<v Speaker 8>regulates how much is going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So he adds.</v>

2079
01:33:08.941 --> 01:33:13.230
<v Speaker 8>So the local power plant or whatever is </v>
<v Speaker 8>supplying them power doesn't have to </v>

2080
01:33:13.230 --> 01:33:13.330
<v Speaker 8>work as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's so fucking weird,</v>

2081
01:33:13.331 --> 01:33:14.020
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Crazy.</v>

2082
01:33:14.210 --> 01:33:16.100
<v Speaker 8>You can turn wind into money.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2083
01:33:16.101 --> 01:33:21.101
<v Speaker 8>if you ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's certain parts of California </v>

2084
01:33:21.101 --> 01:33:21.101
<v Speaker 8>where we,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2085
01:33:21.101 --> 01:33:21.610
<v Speaker 8>we have filmed some fear factors where </v>
<v Speaker 8>they have these um,</v>

2086
01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:26.470
<v Speaker 8>these huge,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like they look like a farm of these wind</v>

2087
01:33:26.471 --> 01:33:27.610
<v Speaker 8>things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>These windmills,</v>

2088
01:33:27.611 --> 01:33:32.611
<v Speaker 8>like a windmill farm and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 8>shitload of them just sitting up on a </v>

2089
01:33:32.611 --> 01:33:33.340
<v Speaker 8>hill and they power the area.</v>

2090
01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.590
<v Speaker 8>I don't mind it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know how much they power,</v>

2091
01:33:35.591 --> 01:33:37.060
<v Speaker 8>how many structures,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how many buildings.</v>

2092
01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:42.480
<v Speaker 8>But it's enough that the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a lot of shit is getting powered by the </v>

2093
01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.300
<v Speaker 8>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's really a trip.</v>

2094
01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:45.060
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's really windy out there too,</v>

2095
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:50.070
<v Speaker 8>so it's a smart thing to do like even as</v>
<v Speaker 8>you come out here towards Pasadena and </v>

2096
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:54.241
<v Speaker 8>you head up the 2:10</v>
<v Speaker 8>and when you go through that whole </v>

2097
01:33:54.241 --> 01:33:54.760
<v Speaker 8>mountain ipass ii area where it's like </v>
<v Speaker 8>you lose your cell phone signal,</v>

2098
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:57.790
<v Speaker 8>fucking beautiful out there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Windy as fuck.</v>

2099
01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.890
<v Speaker 8>A lot of people have like real wind </v>
<v Speaker 8>problems.</v>

2100
01:33:59.891 --> 01:34:03.250
<v Speaker 8>Even out here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like remember when they had a problem?</v>

2101
01:34:03.251 --> 01:34:08.251
<v Speaker 8>Really recently the wind knocked down a </v>
<v Speaker 8>lot of power cables and Pastina guy </v>

2102
01:34:08.251 --> 01:34:09.850
<v Speaker 8>because he got fucked by wind.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got trapped here.</v>

2103
01:34:09.851 --> 01:34:13.550
<v Speaker 8>I couldn't even lead the place.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Fuck why wind from the was too bad.</v>

2104
01:34:13.570 --> 01:34:17.890
<v Speaker 8>I like seriously the street out front </v>
<v Speaker 8>here with trees flying down the street,</v>

2105
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:20.920
<v Speaker 8>things off,</v>
<v Speaker 8>flying off the roofs,</v>

2106
01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:23.850
<v Speaker 8>like metal things and awnings and stayed</v>
<v Speaker 8>in.</v>

2107
01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:26.890
<v Speaker 8>They couldn't get to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>My car was too scary,</v>

2108
01:34:26.891 --> 01:34:28.180
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was a death.</v>

2109
01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.370
<v Speaker 8>It was deadly outside.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was like being in a tornado.</v>

2110
01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:32.170
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2111
01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:33.460
<v Speaker 8>it was no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>seriously.</v>

2112
01:34:33.461 --> 01:34:34.650
<v Speaker 8>It was really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It.</v>

2113
01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:39.660
<v Speaker 8>There's nothing like NATO.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Next time you go out in his back door </v>

2114
01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:39.660
<v Speaker 8>over here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>look at the billboard.</v>

2115
01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:44.341
<v Speaker 8>That's billboard wishes ripping apart </v>
<v Speaker 8>and it was like a super old billboard </v>

2116
01:34:44.341 --> 01:34:46.660
<v Speaker 8>was shaking like this and things were </v>
<v Speaker 8>just flying off of it.</v>

2117
01:34:46.690 --> 01:34:49.750
<v Speaker 8>That's really powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's nothing like a fucking tornado.</v>

2118
01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:50.580
<v Speaker 8>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2119
01:34:50.630 --> 01:34:55.630
<v Speaker 8>there's been tornadoes that were hit or </v>
<v Speaker 8>hit cities in the middle of the night </v>

2120
01:34:55.630 --> 01:34:57.800
<v Speaker 8>and literally made the city disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Especially towns,</v>

2121
01:34:57.870 --> 01:34:59.600
<v Speaker 8>small towns in the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2122
01:34:59.601 --> 01:35:04.601
<v Speaker 8>what they say that the heat of cities </v>
<v Speaker 8>actually prevents tornadoes since all </v>

2123
01:35:04.601 --> 01:35:07.940
<v Speaker 8>the structure and the way it's the way </v>
<v Speaker 8>it's built and the heat coming off of it</v>

2124
01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.530
<v Speaker 8>apparently doesn't work in cities.</v>

2125
01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.590
<v Speaker 8>Do you believe any of that weather </v>
<v Speaker 8>control shit they talk about like,</v>

2126
01:35:12.591 --> 01:35:14.760
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's the name of like that,</v>

2127
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:21.100
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>these Eddie Bravo on here for this </v>

2128
01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:21.100
<v Speaker 8>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do you believe in that?</v>

2129
01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:24.861
<v Speaker 8>Like they've been,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they've been trying to like actually </v>

2130
01:35:24.861 --> 01:35:24.861
<v Speaker 8>can.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know they do it like in China,</v>

2131
01:35:24.861 --> 01:35:28.781
<v Speaker 8>don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like they've been playing around trying </v>

2132
01:35:28.781 --> 01:35:30.491
<v Speaker 8>to make it rain and like you can put </v>
<v Speaker 8>certain particles into the air that </v>

2133
01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:32.260
<v Speaker 8>actually makes it rain.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

2134
01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:37.130
<v Speaker 8>well they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It sounds like it's some kind of weird.</v>

2135
01:35:37.410 --> 01:35:40.130
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they will for sure have done that.</v>

2136
01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:45.880
<v Speaker 8>In Abu Dhabi.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They did it more than 50 times last </v>

2137
01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:45.880
<v Speaker 8>year.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think they did it once a week.</v>

2138
01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:45.960
<v Speaker 8>Last year.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They made it ran.</v>

2139
01:35:46.270 --> 01:35:48.470
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't remember what the exact chemical</v>

2140
01:35:48.471 --> 01:35:53.471
<v Speaker 8>they use,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whether there's something with the gum </v>

2141
01:35:53.471 --> 01:35:54.410
<v Speaker 8>line,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the crowds with a something silver.</v>

2142
01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:56.300
<v Speaker 8>I don't remember what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but um,</v>

2143
01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:58.460
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they in the clouds with this shit and it</v>

2144
01:35:58.461 --> 01:35:59.000
<v Speaker 8>makes a rand.</v>

2145
01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:02.590
<v Speaker 8>So it's so odd to think about Nicole.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's still Nicholson,</v>

2146
01:36:02.730 --> 01:36:07.730
<v Speaker 8>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's really fucking odd to think </v>

2147
01:36:07.730 --> 01:36:10.031
<v Speaker 8>about the fact that they're just </v>
<v Speaker 8>starting to learn to control the </v>

2148
01:36:10.031 --> 01:36:13.601
<v Speaker 8>weather.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're just starting to learn to </v>

2149
01:36:13.601 --> 01:36:15.641
<v Speaker 8>control the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whether they're just starting to learn </v>

2150
01:36:15.641 --> 01:36:18.551
<v Speaker 8>to have endless amounts of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So if we were to evolve and advance </v>

2151
01:36:18.551 --> 01:36:20.930
<v Speaker 8>without blowing each other up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we would eventually be.</v>

2152
01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:25.460
<v Speaker 8>We could eventually be a planet that has</v>
<v Speaker 8>full control of its weather patterns.</v>

2153
01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:29.300
<v Speaker 8>Cloud seeding can actually be done by </v>
<v Speaker 8>ground generators,</v>

2154
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:33.900
<v Speaker 8>a plane or it can be done by a rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Weird.</v>

2155
01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:36.200
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

2156
01:36:36.201 --> 01:36:41.201
<v Speaker 8>Silver iodide,</v>
<v Speaker 8>dry ice solid carbon dioxide.</v>

2157
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:48.310
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That Pasadena storm was 80 miles per </v>

2158
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:50.150
<v Speaker 8>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A ef one tornado 73 miles per hour.</v>

2159
01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.820
<v Speaker 8>So it's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's faster than f one.</v>

2160
01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:56.780
<v Speaker 8>What?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's how fast a f one starts at 73 miles</v>

2161
01:36:56.781 --> 01:36:58.850
<v Speaker 8>per hour in that Pasadena store ans 80 </v>
<v Speaker 8>miles.</v>

2162
01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:00.350
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I thought you had them reversed.</v>

2163
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:03.950
<v Speaker 8>So it's faster than a tornado.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was like an ef one tornado.</v>

2164
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:07.070
<v Speaker 8>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 8>That doesn't even make sense.</v>

2165
01:37:07.610 --> 01:37:09.230
<v Speaker 8>Where there's different levels of </v>
<v Speaker 8>tornadoes.</v>

2166
01:37:09.250 --> 01:37:11.070
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so it was like bitch ass tornadoes don't</v>

2167
01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:12.320
<v Speaker 8>to kill anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2168
01:37:12.321 --> 01:37:16.670
<v Speaker 8>not really bitch ass that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's a good tornado,</v>

2169
01:37:16.671 --> 01:37:17.900
<v Speaker 8>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2170
01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:23.320
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like the beginning of a hurricane </v>

2171
01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:23.320
<v Speaker 8>winds.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They have.</v>

2172
01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:26.350
<v Speaker 8>They've even used liquid propane to make</v>
<v Speaker 8>it rain expands into a gas has also been</v>

2173
01:37:27.501 --> 01:37:32.501
<v Speaker 8>used.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This can be can ice crystals at higher </v>

2174
01:37:32.501 --> 01:37:35.531
<v Speaker 8>temperatures than silver iodide.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The use of high gross scopic materials </v>

2175
01:37:36.431 --> 01:37:41.330
<v Speaker 8>such as salt is becoming more popular </v>
<v Speaker 8>after promising research citation needed</v>

2176
01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:45.170
<v Speaker 8>seating in cows requires that they </v>
<v Speaker 8>contained super cooled liquid water.</v>

2177
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:48.800
<v Speaker 8>That is that liquid water colder than </v>
<v Speaker 8>zero degrees Celsius.</v>

2178
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:51.800
<v Speaker 8>The introduction of a substance such as </v>
<v Speaker 8>silver iodide,</v>

2179
01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:54.680
<v Speaker 8>which has crystalline structure similar </v>
<v Speaker 8>to that of ice,</v>

2180
01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:59.740
<v Speaker 8>will induce freezing nucleation,</v>
<v Speaker 8>dry ice or propane expansion cools the </v>

2181
01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:04.860
<v Speaker 8>air to such an extent that the ice </v>
<v Speaker 8>crystals can nucleate spontaneously from</v>

2182
01:38:04.861 --> 01:38:05.700
<v Speaker 8>the vapor phase.</v>

2183
01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:06.660
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is crazy.</v>

2184
01:38:06.661 --> 01:38:08.840
<v Speaker 8>Kids in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 8>people are terrified.</v>

2185
01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:12.050
<v Speaker 8>In the fucking future.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You might be able to send your name,</v>

2186
01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:15.330
<v Speaker 8>your personal nanobots swarm out of your</v>
<v Speaker 8>house,</v>

2187
01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.360
<v Speaker 8>into the clouds above your house and </v>
<v Speaker 8>make a little personal thunder shower </v>

2188
01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:21.160
<v Speaker 8>happen above your house.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2189
01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:26.180
<v Speaker 8>You probably will be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's how much it probably pulls water </v>

2190
01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:26.180
<v Speaker 8>from farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know?</v>

2191
01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:27.060
<v Speaker 8>It's probably like.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

2192
01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:27.960
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Where does that,</v>

2193
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:30.450
<v Speaker 8>what we like when you go to a place like</v>
<v Speaker 8>Abu Dhabi,</v>

2194
01:38:30.451 --> 01:38:33.210
<v Speaker 8>which is in the desert and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 8>All of a sudden they're making it rain.</v>

2195
01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.470
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What are they doing?</v>

2196
01:38:34.710 --> 01:38:36.990
<v Speaker 8>Where's that water coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Somebody else getting fucked over,</v>

2197
01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:39.300
<v Speaker 8>but you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But anyway.</v>

2198
01:38:39.301 --> 01:38:40.890
<v Speaker 8>Does that other person deserve that </v>
<v Speaker 8>water?</v>

2199
01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:45.970
<v Speaker 8>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Who fucking deserves a lot of the smart </v>

2200
01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:47.901
<v Speaker 8>manager figures out how to pull it out </v>
<v Speaker 8>of the sky or some shithead just camps </v>

2201
01:38:47.901 --> 01:38:51.251
<v Speaker 8>out next to it and I get lucky with my </v>
<v Speaker 8>water is joining mine.</v>

2202
01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:56.490
<v Speaker 8>I found a spot in the dirt and I claim </v>
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>

2203
01:38:56.491 --> 01:38:57.140
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2204
01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:59.790
<v Speaker 8>I think the guy who pulls it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>sky shit when for sure.</v>

2205
01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:02.400
<v Speaker 8>Fuck that stupid color.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Anyone can make a puddle.</v>

2206
01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.860
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so there is.</v>

2207
01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:08.040
<v Speaker 8>There is some cloud seeding.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's real science.</v>

2208
01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:12.270
<v Speaker 8>Whether or not that shit is happening in</v>
<v Speaker 8>Burbank everyday like Eddie Bravo thinks</v>

2209
01:39:12.271 --> 01:39:13.430
<v Speaker 8>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>All right.</v>

2210
01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.710
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's where it gets tricky now that.</v>

2211
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:17.730
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What do you think it is?</v>

2212
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.310
<v Speaker 8>I can error planes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's all it is.</v>

2213
01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:23.700
<v Speaker 8>It's funny because it's always near an </v>
<v Speaker 8>airport.</v>

2214
01:39:23.701 --> 01:39:26.040
<v Speaker 8>Like I live in Burbank.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I see it all the time because I lived by</v>

2215
01:39:26.050 --> 01:39:31.050
<v Speaker 8>Burbank because dude,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't even understand that's the </v>

2216
01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:31.370
<v Speaker 8>government is spraying.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're spraying the sky pilot.</v>

2217
01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:33.720
<v Speaker 8>I just want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The pilots are so there are these pilots</v>

2218
01:39:33.721 --> 01:39:35.370
<v Speaker 8>who were flying over the city and </v>
<v Speaker 8>they're like,</v>

2219
01:39:35.371 --> 01:39:38.520
<v Speaker 8>let's dump poison for the good of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>country.</v>

2220
01:39:38.610 --> 01:39:40.740
<v Speaker 8>That they think they're creating clouds </v>
<v Speaker 8>for us.</v>

2221
01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:43.430
<v Speaker 8>I don't think they're doing it as much </v>
<v Speaker 8>as johnny.</v>

2222
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:45.390
<v Speaker 8>They,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's listens every.</v>

2223
01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:50.620
<v Speaker 8>The insurance companies have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 8>money on skin cancer and it's way </v>

2224
01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:50.620
<v Speaker 8>cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If we have a closet door,</v>

2225
01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:53.830
<v Speaker 8>we got to cover it up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't want some burns to have.</v>

2226
01:39:53.850 --> 01:39:58.230
<v Speaker 8>I think what I've read and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's been explained to me by pilots is</v>

2227
01:39:58.231 --> 01:40:03.231
<v Speaker 8>that under certain conditions there's a </v>
<v Speaker 8>certain amount of moisture in the air </v>

2228
01:40:03.231 --> 01:40:04.230
<v Speaker 8>and it gets turned up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the uh,</v>

2229
01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:09.740
<v Speaker 8>turbines have a jet engine and it comes </v>
<v Speaker 8>out looking like clouds and it stays in </v>

2230
01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:09.740
<v Speaker 8>this guy for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Turned up water.</v>

2231
01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:11.660
<v Speaker 8>Can I tell you what the real fucking </v>
<v Speaker 8>conspiracy.</v>

2232
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:13.890
<v Speaker 8>I figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>

2233
01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:19.250
<v Speaker 8>It's the conspiracy of all conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's your inability to stop your hand </v>

2234
01:40:20.131 --> 01:40:21.960
<v Speaker 8>from putting shit into your mouth.</v>

2235
01:40:22.110 --> 01:40:27.110
<v Speaker 8>That's the conspiracy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's the fact that people can't control </v>

2236
01:40:27.110 --> 01:40:31.101
<v Speaker 8>their fucking hand and are always </v>
<v Speaker 8>shoving poison into their mouth and </v>

2237
01:40:31.101 --> 01:40:34.620
<v Speaker 8>eating shitty things and smoking shitty </v>
<v Speaker 8>things and taking bad pictures.</v>

2238
01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:37.320
<v Speaker 8>This was going to be profound.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I feel like that is profound,</v>

2239
01:40:37.321 --> 01:40:39.660
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can remember talking to a guy believed</v>

2240
01:40:39.661 --> 01:40:42.120
<v Speaker 8>in Kim trails some fucking help,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some discipline.</v>

2241
01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:43.530
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2242
01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:48.740
<v Speaker 8>I was talking to a guy believed in chem </v>
<v Speaker 8>trails and he was smoking a cigarette </v>

2243
01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:52.530
<v Speaker 8>while he was telling me about the </v>
<v Speaker 8>poisons that the government's dumping.</v>

2244
01:40:52.590 --> 01:40:53.560
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well Michael Rupert.</v>

2245
01:40:53.561 --> 01:40:55.660
<v Speaker 8>When Michael Rupert in here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's sweating like crazy.</v>

2246
01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:58.160
<v Speaker 8>Talking about conspiracy theorist Alex </v>
<v Speaker 8>Jones spoke,</v>

2247
01:40:59.630 --> 01:41:02.080
<v Speaker 8>man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're killing yourself.</v>

2248
01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:07.120
<v Speaker 8>Like maybe there is some kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 8>evil external force that's trying to </v>

2249
01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:11.071
<v Speaker 8>destroy you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but really you're the one shoveling the </v>

2250
01:41:11.071 --> 01:41:13.450
<v Speaker 8>poison and your fucking in in your pile,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know for sure is going to kill you.</v>

2251
01:41:13.450 --> 01:41:16.300
<v Speaker 8>You're aiding them by bringing these </v>
<v Speaker 8>troops into your body.</v>

2252
01:41:16.301 --> 01:41:17.680
<v Speaker 8>Saying one day I'm going to fight them </v>
<v Speaker 8>off,</v>

2253
01:41:17.681 --> 01:41:19.690
<v Speaker 8>but not now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>By now,</v>

2254
01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:21.880
<v Speaker 8>I just fucking sick to try to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 8>out.</v>

2255
01:41:21.881 --> 01:41:24.430
<v Speaker 8>I'm a pete.</v>
<v Speaker 8>These motherfuckers signed for my fourth</v>

2256
01:41:24.431 --> 01:41:28.090
<v Speaker 8>cupcake going to drink because let's </v>
<v Speaker 8>have.</v>

2257
01:41:28.210 --> 01:41:30.500
<v Speaker 8>Let's have 17 beers today.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Again,</v>

2258
01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:35.520
<v Speaker 8>I think it comes back to what we were </v>
<v Speaker 8>talking about earlier about the native </v>

2259
01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:38.011
<v Speaker 8>Americans having a much better sense of </v>
<v Speaker 8>their connection with the food that </v>

2260
01:41:38.011 --> 01:41:42.001
<v Speaker 8>they're eating and that for us,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that whole hunter gatherer thing is out </v>

2261
01:41:42.001 --> 01:41:45.661
<v Speaker 8>the window.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I go to the vons and I pick up meat and </v>

2262
01:41:45.661 --> 01:41:45.661
<v Speaker 8>I go to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2263
01:41:45.661 --> 01:41:46.600
<v Speaker 8>get up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>get myself a nice salad and that's it.</v>

2264
01:41:46.601 --> 01:41:51.601
<v Speaker 8>I didn't have to pick anything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't have to go get my water in </v>

2265
01:41:51.601 --> 01:41:53.260
<v Speaker 8>bottles because all the water's poison.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can't drink it.</v>

2266
01:41:53.290 --> 01:41:54.940
<v Speaker 8>People die occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2267
01:41:54.941 --> 01:41:57.010
<v Speaker 8>totally dude.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And it's just so funny though,</v>

2268
01:41:57.011 --> 01:42:02.011
<v Speaker 8>that so many people writhing in physical</v>
<v Speaker 8>discomfort because they're too fat or </v>

2269
01:42:02.111 --> 01:42:04.690
<v Speaker 8>they don't exercise or they don't eat </v>
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

2270
01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:09.010
<v Speaker 8>Are upset about a conspiracy that the </v>
<v Speaker 8>government is,</v>

2271
01:42:09.011 --> 01:42:11.260
<v Speaker 8>is involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>is trying to take,</v>

2272
01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:13.770
<v Speaker 8>take away their happiness or their </v>
<v Speaker 8>freedom or,</v>

2273
01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:15.130
<v Speaker 8>or,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or dumb them down.</v>

<v Speaker 8>You eat at Mcdonald's,</v>

<v Speaker 8>you smoke cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're house is fucking filthy.</v>

2278
01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:25.690
<v Speaker 8>That's the shit you should worry about </v>
<v Speaker 8>first.</v>

2279
01:42:25.930 --> 01:42:28.600
<v Speaker 8>Fix that conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>solve that problem.</v>

2280
01:42:28.601 --> 01:42:33.601
<v Speaker 8>Like stop that conspiracy from happening</v>

<v Speaker 3>primary like that.</v>

2340
01:45:23.710 --> 01:45:26.140
<v Speaker 3>If it was intelligent and knew to hide </v>
<v Speaker 3>from people.</v>

2471
01:51:14.681 --> 01:51:18.290
<v Speaker 4>find anything even remotely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the rituals outside the law.</v>

2472

2475
01:51:24.670 --> 01:51:29.670

<v Speaker 4>Yet Jesus wanted us to have a beautiful </v>

2483
01:51:48.981 --> 01:51:50.970
<v Speaker 4>giant Golden Palace where I could sit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and fuck fucking fuck kids.</v>

2488
01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:04.060
<v Speaker 3>this attitude is really offending a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people on twitter.</v>

2489

<v Speaker 4>of the Christianity that some people </v>
<v Speaker 4>follow.</v>

2509
01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:53.390
<v Speaker 4>It's based on a lot of the writings of </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody named Paul who,</v>

2510
01:52:53.391 --> 01:52:54.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never met Jesus.</v>

2511
01:52:54.810 --> 01:52:59.810
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was persecuted Christians and he was </v>

2512
01:52:59.810 --> 01:53:01.070
<v Speaker 4>walking on the road to Damascus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a vision.</v>

2513
01:53:01.071 --> 01:53:05.030
<v Speaker 4>His name was saul of Tarsus and he saw a</v>
<v Speaker 4>vision of Jesus.</v>

2514
01:53:05.210 --> 01:53:07.640
<v Speaker 4>Jesus appeared in the sky and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saul,</v>

2515
01:53:07.641 --> 01:53:11.390
<v Speaker 4>so why do you persecute me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at that moment saw was</v>

2516
01:53:11.490 --> 01:53:14.160
<v Speaker 8>filled with the glory of the Lord.</v>

2517
01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:18.050
<v Speaker 4>And he was blinded and he wandered and </v>
<v Speaker 4>found some Christians,</v>

2518
01:53:18.051 --> 01:53:23.051
<v Speaker 4>Phantom and his name became Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was the founder of the modern </v>

2519
01:53:23.051 --> 01:53:26.651
<v Speaker 4>Christian church and you wrote all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>letters about what it is to be a in the </v>

2520
01:53:26.651 --> 01:53:29.060
<v Speaker 4>spirit of Christ and to be with Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he never met God outside of,</v>

2521
01:53:29.061 --> 01:53:30.170
<v Speaker 4>in that vision.</v>

2522
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:32.010
<v Speaker 8>So essentially he was like Jimmy </v>
<v Speaker 8>swaggered,</v>

2523
01:53:32.011 --> 01:53:33.720
<v Speaker 8>but a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 8>remember when Swagger,</v>

2524
01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:36.810
<v Speaker 8>swagger to Pat Robertson,</v>
<v Speaker 8>southern 90 foot tall Jesus.</v>

2525
01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:38.460
<v Speaker 8>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he had a vision.</v>

2526
01:53:38.490 --> 01:53:43.490
<v Speaker 8>This part,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the Paul of Tarsus had to add a vision </v>

2527
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:43.490
<v Speaker 8>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know which one,</v>

2528
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:44.220
<v Speaker 8>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's where it came from.</v>

2529
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:47.070
<v Speaker 8>It wasn't from the original teachings.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2530
01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:50.980
<v Speaker 8>the original teachings don't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm sorry if I'm offending pizza.</v>

2531
01:53:51.090 --> 01:53:52.610
<v Speaker 8>Really Weird though that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

2532
01:53:52.690 --> 01:53:54.210
<v Speaker 8>uh Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was oral roberts,</v>

2533
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:57.990
<v Speaker 8>oral roberts,</v>
<v Speaker 8>900 foot tall Jesus in 1977,</v>

2534
01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:01.000
<v Speaker 8>which is when he would have been around.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That was one 900 foot tall.</v>

2535
01:54:01.001 --> 01:54:02.850
<v Speaker 8>Jesus was touring was part of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>galaxy,</v>

2536
01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:08.600
<v Speaker 8>the fucking galaxy coming to oral </v>
<v Speaker 8>roberts in the middle of the desert and </v>

2537
01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:12.291
<v Speaker 8>showing show themself.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But it's really interesting to think </v>

2538
01:54:12.291 --> 01:54:12.291
<v Speaker 8>about that when you realize that it's </v>
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

2539
01:54:12.291 --> 01:54:13.380
<v Speaker 8>so,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so a lot of people call,</v>

2540
01:54:13.530 --> 01:54:15.720
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's after the gospels,</v>

2541
01:54:15.721 --> 01:54:17.880
<v Speaker 8>the epistles at which a lot of them,</v>

2542
01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:20.770
<v Speaker 4>holly in theology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not Christian Christianity,</v>

2543
01:54:20.771 --> 01:54:24.490
<v Speaker 4>it's based on because here's the big </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem that Christians ran into in many</v>

2544
01:54:24.491 --> 01:54:26.350
<v Speaker 4>verses in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus said,</v>

2545
01:54:26.650 --> 01:54:31.650
<v Speaker 4>before some of you die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be back and even come back </v>

2546
01:54:31.650 --> 01:54:36.650
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the disciples started dying and </v>

2547
01:54:36.650 --> 01:54:36.650
<v Speaker 4>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

2548
01:54:36.650 --> 01:54:36.650
<v Speaker 4>he's not coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we going to do?</v>

2549
01:54:36.650 --> 01:54:39.880
<v Speaker 4>And they had to reorganize shit and turn</v>
<v Speaker 4>it into something that was like,</v>

2550
01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:43.060
<v Speaker 4>that made more sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is to deal with this,</v>

2551
01:54:43.061 --> 01:54:43.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

2552
01:54:43.570 --> 01:54:47.530
<v Speaker 4>some basic problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what Christ,</v>

2553
01:54:47.531 --> 01:54:50.170
<v Speaker 4>if he existed in that story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said it was going to happen,</v>

2554
01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:55.500
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now we've got the bank robbers </v>

2555
01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:55.500
<v Speaker 4>syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that,</v>

2556
01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:55.500
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the bank robber thing.</v>

2557
01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:57.520
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when somebody robs a bank,</v>

2558
01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:00.700
<v Speaker 4>they say everybody get on the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground and don't move.</v>

2559
01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:04.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to walk out of here and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to come back in two minutes.</v>

2560
01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:09.600
<v Speaker 4>And if any of you have moved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to blow your fucking brains </v>

2561
01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:12.061
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what a bank robber does when </v>

2562
01:55:12.061 --> 01:55:12.340
<v Speaker 4>he's robbing a bank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what Jesus did when he said,</v>

2563
01:55:12.370 --> 01:55:15.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be back really soon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if anyone's misbehaving,</v>

2564
01:55:15.401 --> 01:55:20.401
<v Speaker 4>you're going to hell forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's been going on for a long </v>

2565
01:55:20.401 --> 01:55:20.401
<v Speaker 4>fucking time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2566
01:55:20.401 --> 01:55:22.900
<v Speaker 4>and it's probably going to keep going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>and on and on,</v>

2567
01:55:23.110 --> 01:55:26.530
<v Speaker 4>and each it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Each time it advances down a generation,</v>

2568
01:55:26.531 --> 01:55:31.531
<v Speaker 4>it gets weirder and weirder and weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now we've got a guy dressed like a </v>

2569
01:55:31.531 --> 01:55:32.140
<v Speaker 4>fucking gnome feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally cool,</v>

2570
01:55:32.141 --> 01:55:36.190
<v Speaker 4>sitting in a golden throne when there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>people all over the planet starving.</v>

2571
01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:39.670
<v Speaker 4>And somehow that guy is a disciple of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person who went around saying,</v>

2572
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.500
<v Speaker 4>love your neighbor as yourself and love </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Lord your God with all heart,</v>

2573
01:55:43.501 --> 01:55:44.190
<v Speaker 4>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and soul.</v>

2574
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:49.220
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear evidence that he harbored child </v>

2575
01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:52.371
<v Speaker 2>molesters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clear evidence that he derailed </v>

2576
01:55:52.371 --> 01:55:55.461
<v Speaker 2>investigations and move people around </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was whatever the fuck he was a </v>

2577
01:55:55.461 --> 01:55:57.120
<v Speaker 2>bishop or whatever the fuck he was when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing this.</v>

2578
01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:59.210
<v Speaker 2>He was in Phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2579
01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Ratzinger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

2580
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:02.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine the bitch.</v>

2581
01:56:02.670 --> 01:56:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen the pictures of him </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the male gymnast?</v>

2582
01:56:05.970 --> 01:56:10.970
<v Speaker 2>The acrobatics that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly still think that that was </v>

2583
01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:10.970
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't because my brain seems fake.</v>

2584
01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:13.470
<v Speaker 2>It's fake right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally real.</v>

2585
01:56:13.810 --> 01:56:16.590
<v Speaker 2>They the pope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did all that?</v>

2586
01:56:16.591 --> 01:56:21.591
<v Speaker 2>How does Catholicism become the leading </v>
<v Speaker 2>source of power worldwide of </v>

2587
01:56:21.591 --> 01:56:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Christianity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's red,</v>

2588
01:56:22.670 --> 01:56:24.290
<v Speaker 2>there's all the other forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity.</v>

2589
01:56:24.570 --> 01:56:29.570
<v Speaker 2>They seem to be much more scattered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's not like one heavy duty </v>

2590
01:56:29.570 --> 01:56:29.850
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The head of it,</v>

2591
01:56:29.851 --> 01:56:31.500
<v Speaker 2>like Catholicism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2592
01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:33.570
<v Speaker 2>we were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's the main guy and Episcopalian?</v>

2593
01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Who's the main guy in the baptist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one.</v>

2594
01:56:38.941 --> 01:56:42.520
<v Speaker 2>There's no main guy like the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>pope that's like there's a.</v>

2595
01:56:42.530 --> 01:56:44.670
<v Speaker 2>there's a hierarchy in the episcopal </v>
<v Speaker 2>church,</v>

2596
01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:46.260
<v Speaker 2>but nothing like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2597
01:56:46.261 --> 01:56:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Worldwide recognized the pope is the top</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog.</v>

2598
01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:52.980
<v Speaker 2>How did that get to be the strongest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most powerful form of Christianity,</v>

2599
01:56:53.130 --> 01:56:53.850
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2600
01:56:53.851 --> 01:56:57.690
<v Speaker 2>also the most nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most fucking crazy judgmental,</v>

2601
01:56:57.691 --> 01:57:02.691
<v Speaker 2>the most guilt ridden in injecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible feelings of sorrow into little </v>

2602
01:57:02.691 --> 01:57:03.780
<v Speaker 2>boys' heads because they touch their </v>
<v Speaker 2>penis.</v>

2603
01:57:03.810 --> 01:57:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe?</v>

2604
01:57:04.621 --> 01:57:09.621
<v Speaker 2>Is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a statistic on the what </v>

2605
01:57:09.621 --> 01:57:10.840
<v Speaker 2>percentage of priests and the last kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>is 89 percent,</v>

2606
01:57:12.630 --> 01:57:14.490
<v Speaker 2>but we must know a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2607
01:57:14.491 --> 01:57:17.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it comes up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they can.</v>

2608
01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:22.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is there a number of priests that </v>

2609
01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:22.860
<v Speaker 2>have gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten incarcerated for molesting kids?</v>

2610
01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:24.910
<v Speaker 2>What's that number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many is it?</v>

2611
01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Seven 97.</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 seven percent.</v>

2612
01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Don't listen to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

2613
01:57:29.831 --> 01:57:33.180
<v Speaker 2>I know you're talking to 20 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the allegations.</v>

2614
01:57:33.181 --> 01:57:34.770
<v Speaker 2>The priests was deceased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2615
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:39.800
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just curious if they're sending the </v>

2616
01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:40.620
<v Speaker 2>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what percentage of priest abuse.</v>

2617
01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see here.</v>

2618
01:57:46.230 --> 01:57:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Don't know ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2619
01:57:48.361 --> 01:57:50.790
<v Speaker 2>there is certainly a certain number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>priests who had been charged.</v>

2620
01:57:50.791 --> 01:57:52.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that that story has come up,</v>

2621
01:57:52.501 --> 01:57:54.600
<v Speaker 2>so there's gotta be some number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just wondering how many.</v>

2622
01:57:54.810 --> 01:57:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2623
01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2624
01:57:57.151 --> 01:58:00.630
<v Speaker 2>It's only for their concluding there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it's at 40 percent.</v>

2625
01:58:00.631 --> 01:58:05.631
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I my brain blip for a second and </v>

2626
01:58:05.631 --> 01:58:07.530
<v Speaker 2>concluded that for about four percent of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the US priests since 1950,</v>

2627
01:58:07.531 --> 01:58:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I've been accused of sexual abuse of </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

2628
01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

2629
01:58:10.951 --> 01:58:15.951
<v Speaker 2>here's the caveats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are probably many victims who </v>

2630
01:58:15.951 --> 01:58:17.100
<v Speaker 2>remain silent and not yet come forward </v>
<v Speaker 2>to accuse their abusers.</v>

2631
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:20.550
<v Speaker 2>There are probably some adults who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>come forward to accused priests who have</v>

2632
01:58:20.551 --> 01:58:23.490
<v Speaker 2>false recovered memories of abuse that </v>
<v Speaker 2>never happened,</v>

2633
01:58:23.491 --> 01:58:28.491
<v Speaker 2>so it could be both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine maybe some adults who knowingly </v>

2634
01:58:28.491 --> 01:58:31.290
<v Speaker 2>falsely accused innocent priests who </v>
<v Speaker 2>abuse they do to imagine this.</v>

2635
01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if four percent of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>work at apple stores had been accused of</v>

2636
01:58:36.181 --> 01:58:37.170
<v Speaker 2>molesting kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2637
01:58:37.171 --> 01:58:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I used that onstage before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said that Nascar driver,</v>

2638
01:58:39.761 --> 01:58:44.110
<v Speaker 2>so saying a massive organization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nascar drivers running around in circles</v>

2639
01:58:44.111 --> 01:58:46.000
<v Speaker 2>with their cars and then fucking kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2640
01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:46.500
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2641
01:58:46.501 --> 01:58:48.700
<v Speaker 2>we'd say we don't need Nascar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>

2642
01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That four percent of apple employees,</v>

2643
01:58:51.721 --> 01:58:54.070
<v Speaker 2>probably molests kids because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>the computer nerds.</v>

2644
01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:54.400
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2645
01:58:54.401 --> 01:58:56.410
<v Speaker 2>they don't get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not even funny.</v>

2646
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:58.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2647
01:58:58.121 --> 01:58:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm being serious there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say like,</v>

2648
01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:04.800
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four percent of apple employees don't </v>

2649
01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:04.800
<v Speaker 2>fuck kids do.</v>

2650
01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:04.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny,</v>

2651
01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:08.761
<v Speaker 2>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny percentage of people in the whole </v>

2652
01:59:08.761 --> 01:59:08.890
<v Speaker 2>world who were child molesters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really small.</v>

2653
01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:10.750
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it happens,</v>

2654
01:59:10.751 --> 01:59:15.751
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it's one in a community of a </v>

2655
01:59:15.751 --> 01:59:15.751
<v Speaker 2>million people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot.</v>

2656
01:59:15.751 --> 01:59:16.690
<v Speaker 2>1,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>

2657
01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Have you looked at the APP that shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>you who are near?</v>

2658
01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:23.290
<v Speaker 2>There's like 300 in Burbank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2659
01:59:23.291 --> 01:59:28.291
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many millions of people live in </v>

2660
01:59:28.291 --> 01:59:28.291
<v Speaker 2>Burbank?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2661
01:59:28.291 --> 01:59:28.480
<v Speaker 2>how many people you think live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Burbank?</v>

2662
01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Let's say population of Burbank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go 500,000</v>

2663
01:59:30.810 --> 01:59:35.810
<v Speaker 2>deal with every series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something I've been trying to </v>

2664
01:59:35.810 --> 01:59:37.060
<v Speaker 2>figure out for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to hear the answer.</v>

2665
01:59:44.150 --> 01:59:46.670
<v Speaker 2>What is the population at Burbank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California?</v>

2666
01:59:49.810 --> 01:59:51.430
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 3000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three hundred 40.</v>

2667
01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:53.910
<v Speaker 2>To answer your question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2668
01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got your bench.</v>

2669
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:56.410
<v Speaker 2>One hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three thousand.</v>

2670
01:59:56.411 --> 02:00:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Three hundred 40 in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So out of that,</v>

2671
02:00:00.130 --> 02:00:02.350
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many pedals are in Burbank?</v>

2672
02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:04.030
<v Speaker 6>MMM.</v>

2673
02:00:04.730 --> 02:00:09.730
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a song?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should be some hipsters on some ironic,</v>

2674
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.630
<v Speaker 2>ironic hipster song about beddoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2675
02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:15.870
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably say I would probably say it</v>
<v Speaker 2>100.</v>

2676
02:00:16.610 --> 02:00:21.610
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a an uncomfortable number of </v>

2677
02:00:21.610 --> 02:00:22.340
<v Speaker 2>people that have fuck kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an question.</v>

2678
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all pretty disgusting and </v>

2679
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.750
<v Speaker 2>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2680
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:32.600
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the first things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>should eradicate because if that's </v>

2681
02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:35.890
<v Speaker 2>something that flux kid up for the rest </v>
<v Speaker 2>of her life and then if they lash out </v>

2682
02:00:35.890 --> 02:00:35.890
<v Speaker 2>and start doing on new kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they become.</v>

2683
02:00:35.890 --> 02:00:37.780
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's like a vampire.</v>

2684
02:00:37.781 --> 02:00:42.781
<v Speaker 2>It's real vampires like you actually do </v>
<v Speaker 2>infect someone and make them what you </v>

2685
02:00:42.781 --> 02:00:44.990
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A monster transmits itself and it's been</v>

2686
02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:47.030
<v Speaker 2>transmitted for a fucking long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2687
02:00:47.031 --> 02:00:49.010
<v Speaker 2>It's been being transmitted for </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations.</v>

2688
02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:54.040
<v Speaker 2>It's such a gross thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a broken thing and it has </v>

2689
02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:54.040
<v Speaker 2>roots in primate behavior.</v>

2690
02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:58.040
<v Speaker 2>That's what's really fucked up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexuality is so strange and in our world</v>

2691
02:00:58.041 --> 02:01:01.100
<v Speaker 2>it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so unnatural because we're actually</v>

2692
02:01:01.101 --> 02:01:04.010
<v Speaker 2>covering our bodies up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hide our genitals.</v>

2693
02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:09.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have this weird sort of a common </v>

2694
02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:12.550
<v Speaker 2>atory lifestyle of natural animal urges </v>
<v Speaker 2>mixed with his higher self and </v>

2695
02:01:14.811 --> 02:01:19.811
<v Speaker 2>consciousness in language and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness of the impact of your words </v>

2696
02:01:19.811 --> 02:01:23.441
<v Speaker 2>and deeds and physical acts on other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and that you're putting out a </v>

2697
02:01:23.441 --> 02:01:26.300
<v Speaker 2>negative energy in a negative vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we encourage that in our communities</v>

2698
02:01:26.301 --> 02:01:28.970
<v Speaker 2>and discourage that in our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our laws.</v>

2699
02:01:29.390 --> 02:01:31.490
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is we have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

2700
02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:34.430
<v Speaker 2>these urges to fuck and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulated.</v>

2701
02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:36.680
<v Speaker 2>They're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's like recognizing that like,</v>

2702
02:01:36.681 --> 02:01:37.200
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2703
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:40.090
<v Speaker 2>we need to like why is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is prostitution bad?</v>

2704
02:01:40.090 --> 02:01:44.240
<v Speaker 3>If someone explained that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone needs money and someone has a</v>

2705
02:01:44.241 --> 02:01:45.350
<v Speaker 3>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2706
02:01:45.351 --> 02:01:46.430
<v Speaker 3>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2707
02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:49.430
<v Speaker 3>I can make a lot of money with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth and what is worse?</v>

2708
02:01:49.610 --> 02:01:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Working at Wendy's for a week and making</v>
<v Speaker 3>$300 or sucking a guy's Dick for 10 </v>

2709
02:01:55.941 --> 02:01:59.120
<v Speaker 3>minutes and making $500.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people will go,</v>

2710
02:01:59.121 --> 02:02:01.460
<v Speaker 3>I would rather suck this guy's Dick and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

2711
02:02:01.461 --> 02:02:03.860
<v Speaker 3>he's some poor guy who's Horny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2712
02:02:03.861 --> 02:02:08.861
<v Speaker 3>and it's like you give him a mouth </v>
<v Speaker 3>massage on his dick and he blows a load </v>

2713
02:02:09.171 --> 02:02:11.630
<v Speaker 3>in your mouth and he's so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

2714
02:02:11.631 --> 02:02:13.760
<v Speaker 3>he's so released like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was so good.</v>

2715
02:02:13.761 --> 02:02:16.220
<v Speaker 3>And he gives you $100 tip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you made 600 bucks.</v>

2716
02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:17.710
<v Speaker 3>Why is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2717
02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:19.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it okay to do that for free?</v>

2718
02:02:20.150 --> 02:02:22.100
<v Speaker 3>How come if she meets that guy and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>likes him,</v>

2719
02:02:22.250 --> 02:02:24.380
<v Speaker 3>she blows them and it's the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that ever happened,</v>

2720
02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:28.190
<v Speaker 3>then that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if she meets that guy and you know,</v>

2721
02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:29.000
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>how many sex offenders are in each city </v>

2728

<v Speaker 5>numbered one.</v>

2731
02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:51.520
<v Speaker 5>sex offenders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's more than one percent.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Queer.</v>

2812
02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:30.160
<v Speaker 8>Queer is a totally obscure one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They don't want to define it like they </v>

2813
02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:30.160
<v Speaker 8>might like guys.</v>

2817
02:06:36.001 --> 02:06:41.001
<v Speaker 8>How can you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is that the most ambiguous definition </v>

2819
02:06:41.001 --> 02:06:45.560

<v Speaker 8>but that's when people are going real </v>

2820
02:06:46.411 --> 02:06:46.850
<v Speaker 8>deep.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2821
02:06:47.100 --> 02:06:52.100
<v Speaker 8>it's because they want people to be able</v>
<v Speaker 8>to define themselves and I agree with </v>

2822
02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:53.020
<v Speaker 8>that man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Of course,</v>

2823
02:06:53.050 --> 02:06:58.050
<v Speaker 8>whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but when you're getting mad at people </v>

2824
02:06:58.050 --> 02:06:59.310
<v Speaker 8>saying gay slurs used,</v>

<v Speaker 8>what's behind there.</v>

2828
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:06.420
<v Speaker 8>If there's anger behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's an ugly word.</v>

2829
02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:11.070
<v Speaker 8>It's why a black people can call you </v>
<v Speaker 8>niggers.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Some old man is yelling at a young kid </v>

2835
02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:29.900
<v Speaker 8>because he's walking on his lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then it becomes offensive and </v>

2836
02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:32.900
<v Speaker 8>dehumanizing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I meant obviously I met a beautiful </v>

<v Speaker 2>shape for that first.</v>

2841

<v Speaker 2>Now you always start off with at your </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst,</v>

2842
02:07:45.130 --> 02:07:48.310
<v Speaker 2>start off with your worst presentation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if they accept you at that,</v>

2847
02:07:58.291 --> 02:07:58.330
<v Speaker 2>get back in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was because I was out of,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's like art.</v>

2885
02:09:34.190 --> 02:09:38.560
<v Speaker 2>So there's a certain art in what she </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like her body.</v>

2886
02:09:38.561 --> 02:09:40.690
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so sexually arousing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at her perfectly manicured toes</v>

<v Speaker 2>and her toe ring and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want to lick her button.</v>

2889
02:09:46.751 --> 02:09:48.400
<v Speaker 2>That's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right word.</v>

2890
02:09:48.401 --> 02:09:49.680
<v Speaker 2>You're obsessed with that button.</v>

2891
02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's placed perfectly.</v>

2892
02:09:52.301 --> 02:09:54.780
<v Speaker 2>I want to dumb luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2893
02:09:54.781 --> 02:09:59.781
<v Speaker 2>see the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd line up on the other side of her </v>

2894
02:09:59.781 --> 02:09:59.781
<v Speaker 2>shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just the way it is.</v>

2895
02:09:59.781 --> 02:10:00.040
<v Speaker 2>It's just a hot picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pictures,</v>

2896
02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:01.810
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't create this right here.</v>

2897
02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:03.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unfortunate though,</v>

2898
02:10:03.041 --> 02:10:08.041
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's unfortunate is that women like </v>

2899
02:10:08.041 --> 02:10:10.711
<v Speaker 2>that man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're not like heavy </v>

2900
02:10:10.711 --> 02:10:12.820
<v Speaker 2>duty into working out instead of get </v>
<v Speaker 2>older and they lose their body,</v>

2901
02:10:12.850 --> 02:10:14.770
<v Speaker 2>they become creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2902
02:10:15.050 --> 02:10:17.890
<v Speaker 2>we tried to kill her ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They asked disappears.</v>

2903
02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:22.920
<v Speaker 2>That's when it gets really weird when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see like older women their asses </v>

2904
02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:24.670
<v Speaker 2>like sink and turn under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2905
02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:28.210
<v Speaker 2>and old men to like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get that Larry King Body where the.</v>

2906
02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:31.780
<v Speaker 2>There's no muscle tone going on and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman becomes.</v>

2907
02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>When a woman goes from Pamela Anderson</v>

2908
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.960
<v Speaker 3>and she's still attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she hasn't hit this yet,</v>

2909
02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:37.740
<v Speaker 3>but it's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2910
02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:41.720
<v Speaker 3>unless she figures out some way to do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of fucking squats and keep her body.</v>

2911
02:10:41.721 --> 02:10:46.721
<v Speaker 3>Like when you become a woman who has </v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous artificial boobs and your </v>

2912
02:10:47.901 --> 02:10:52.901
<v Speaker 3>body's kind of falling apart and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have these big bags sitting in front </v>

2913
02:10:52.901 --> 02:10:55.170
<v Speaker 3>pushing out your shirt and you know this</v>
<v Speaker 3>cleavage that you're,</v>

2914
02:10:55.310 --> 02:11:00.310
<v Speaker 3>but it's been sun drenched for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got this weird sort of leathery </v>

2915
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:05.081
<v Speaker 3>texture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new trying to tone that down with heavy </v>

2916
02:11:05.081 --> 02:11:08.051
<v Speaker 3>doses of moisturizer so your tits are </v>
<v Speaker 3>always greasy and leathery at the same </v>

2917
02:11:08.051 --> 02:11:10.730
<v Speaker 3>time and your is of habit rating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he tried to stick it out a little.</v>

2918
02:11:10.731 --> 02:11:15.731
<v Speaker 3>So you're wearing high heel shoes where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really not appropriate and they're </v>

2919
02:11:15.731 --> 02:11:16.240
<v Speaker 3>really high and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2920
02:11:16.241 --> 02:11:18.980
<v Speaker 3>you're awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can barely walk and you really,</v>

2921
02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:19.570
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2922
02:11:19.571 --> 02:11:20.510
<v Speaker 3>your ass has gone.</v>

2923
02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:22.830
<v Speaker 3>You become a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You become a stranger on the news.</v>

2924
02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:26.680
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be like this wave of </v>
<v Speaker 3>suicides from people as well.</v>

2925
02:11:27.250 --> 02:11:28.580
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2926
02:11:28.581 --> 02:11:30.020
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2927
02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2928
02:11:30.501 --> 02:11:31.550
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2929
02:11:31.551 --> 02:11:33.350
<v Speaker 3>that's getting attached to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical,</v>

2930
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:36.230
<v Speaker 3>to your physical body and using that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>your main tool.</v>

2931
02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:38.330
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think dangerous proposition,</v>

2932
02:11:38.331 --> 02:11:40.080
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm you.</v>

2933
02:11:40.130 --> 02:11:45.130
<v Speaker 3>That's a really easy to say though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're a girl and you look like </v>

2934
02:11:45.130 --> 02:11:45.130
<v Speaker 3>Pamela Anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2935
02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:46.820
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she was young,</v>

2936
02:11:46.821 --> 02:11:49.720
<v Speaker 3>she was so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all anyone eat.</v>

2937
02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Probably comment all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Time when she was young,</v>

2938
02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:58.310
<v Speaker 3>all the people that she met,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you everyone was just,</v>

2939
02:11:58.311 --> 02:12:00.290
<v Speaker 3>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're so pretty.</v>

2940
02:12:00.291 --> 02:12:01.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that happens.</v>

2941
02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:03.490
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2942
02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:07.100
<v Speaker 3>when a girl gets addicted and gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught up in that,</v>

2943
02:12:07.130 --> 02:12:12.130
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like there's nothing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>can match the kind of power and energy </v>

2944
02:12:12.130 --> 02:12:12.860
<v Speaker 3>she gets just from her own looks.</v>

2945
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:15.260
<v Speaker 3>So she's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like,</v>

2946
02:12:15.261 --> 02:12:20.261
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was too alluring to just run with </v>

2947
02:12:20.261 --> 02:12:20.261
<v Speaker 3>that too many people were encouraging </v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

2948
02:12:20.261 --> 02:12:25.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and essentially she got away with </v>

2949
02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:25.100
<v Speaker 3>without doing any porn except for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>one accidental time.</v>

2950
02:12:25.450 --> 02:12:25.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2951
02:12:25.981 --> 02:12:27.170
<v Speaker 3>Have a good one too though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2952
02:12:27.171 --> 02:12:29.520
<v Speaker 3>she did like some playboys and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2953
02:12:29.521 --> 02:12:31.660
<v Speaker 3>where you got to see her naked and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was satisfying enough.</v>

2954
02:12:31.661 --> 02:12:34.310
<v Speaker 3>But I mean she made a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was so hot.</v>

2955
02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:37.580
<v Speaker 3>She made a living off being hot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what she did.</v>

2956
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:41.080
<v Speaker 3>What sad is when people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does,</v>

2957
02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:43.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not her fault that she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>super fucking hot.</v>

2958
02:12:43.581 --> 02:12:46.100
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the sad thing is if she was attached</v>

2959
02:12:46.101 --> 02:12:48.310
<v Speaker 3>to that perception of herself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>

2960
02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:51.860
<v Speaker 3>we're just assuming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just assuming now that she's maybe</v>

2961
02:12:51.861 --> 02:12:56.861
<v Speaker 3>she's super cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She sat her down and had a conversation </v>

2962
02:12:56.861 --> 02:12:56.861
<v Speaker 3>whether you would really enjoy it.</v>

2963
02:12:56.861 --> 02:12:58.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's all.</v>

2964
02:12:58.011 --> 02:12:59.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I'm saying is positive.</v>

2965
02:12:59.421 --> 02:13:03.680
<v Speaker 3>All I'm saying is that she was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculously hot when she was young that</v>

2966
02:13:03.681 --> 02:13:07.760
<v Speaker 3>I think almost anybody would have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>corrupted by that kind of beauty and not</v>

2967
02:13:07.761 --> 02:13:09.580
<v Speaker 3>that she even was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I don't.</v>

2968
02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:14.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you could not be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional hot chick if you were that </v>

2969
02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:14.640
<v Speaker 3>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at her dude.</v>

2970
02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Look at her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's from whatever that is.</v>

2971
02:13:16.251 --> 02:13:21.251
<v Speaker 3>That's her prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like one of the hottest chicks </v>

2972
02:13:21.251 --> 02:13:21.251
<v Speaker 3>that's ever walked the face of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

2973
02:13:21.251 --> 02:13:24.860
<v Speaker 3>I pulled back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's actually a reasonable </v>

2974
02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:24.860
<v Speaker 3>back into see your whole body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see your whole body?</v>

<v Speaker 3>so you get that whole thing there,</v>

2976

<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Good for her.</v>

02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:32.910
<v Speaker 3>That chick is hot as fuck.</v>

2979
02:13:33.090 --> 02:13:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's incredibly hot,</v>

2980
02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:36.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2981
02:13:36.391 --> 02:13:39.000
<v Speaker 3>I think when you're that pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you know you have.</v>

2982
02:13:39.001 --> 02:13:44.001
<v Speaker 3>We all have to be reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That girl got some crazy lottery ticket </v>

2983
02:13:44.001 --> 02:13:44.220
<v Speaker 3>and she decided to cash it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

2984
02:13:44.221 --> 02:13:46.390
<v Speaker 3>she ran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She ran the dyson.</v>

2985
02:13:46.391 --> 02:13:48.450
<v Speaker 3>She came up double seven in the looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>department.</v>

2986
02:13:49.050 --> 02:13:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't fault chicks for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't either.</v>

2987
02:13:51.061 --> 02:13:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

2988
02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:53.490
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't saying that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people do,</v>

2989
02:13:53.491 --> 02:13:58.491
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people like immediately they will </v>

2990
02:13:58.491 --> 02:14:00.450
<v Speaker 3>discount somebody if they are a a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a professional hot check or if they're a</v>

2991
02:14:00.451 --> 02:14:05.451
<v Speaker 3>girl who's attractive like immediately </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they know it's so easy to be </v>

2992
02:14:05.451 --> 02:14:06.780
<v Speaker 3>that person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life is so easy.</v>

2993
02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:08.640
<v Speaker 3>What are the odds of you have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking?</v>

2994
02:14:08.850 --> 02:14:13.850
<v Speaker 3>What are the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the odds that you've been </v>

2995
02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:13.850
<v Speaker 3>contemplating your existence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you?</v>

2996
02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Life is so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone is just tripping over </v>

2997
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.151
<v Speaker 3>themselves to try to give you things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've met plenty of them that do and </v>

2998
02:14:20.151 --> 02:14:22.200
<v Speaker 3>those girls are insane for sure.</v>

2999
02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:28.900
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing when you run into someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's in his beautiful and intelligent </v>

3000
02:14:28.900 --> 02:14:30.030
<v Speaker 3>with great personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great sense of humor.</v>

3001
02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:31.320
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3002
02:14:31.321 --> 02:14:36.321
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at you here because to </v>

3003
02:14:36.321 --> 02:14:38.241
<v Speaker 3>get to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to have some humility that </v>

3004
02:14:38.241 --> 02:14:40.611
<v Speaker 3>didn't come from looking in the mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reaction that you're getting from </v>

3005
02:14:40.611 --> 02:14:40.611
<v Speaker 3>the people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could be that.</v>

3006
02:14:40.611 --> 02:14:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just simply that they,</v>

3007
02:14:42.391 --> 02:14:45.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got into yoga or that got into some</v>

3008
02:14:45.121 --> 02:14:48.900
<v Speaker 3>sort of meditation discipline and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of formed.</v>

3009
02:14:48.930 --> 02:14:53.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could have been the way they were </v>

3010
02:14:53.930 --> 02:14:53.930
<v Speaker 3>raised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just sort of formed a,</v>

3011
02:14:53.930 --> 02:14:55.380
<v Speaker 3>a human personality instead of a hot </v>
<v Speaker 3>chick personality.</v>

3012
02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:57.900
<v Speaker 3>That's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must be hard though,</v>

3013
02:14:57.901 --> 02:15:02.901
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being a hot check must be like the </v>

3014
02:15:02.901 --> 02:15:03.420
<v Speaker 3>easiest way to get by in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>skate through a bunch of,</v>

3015
02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:04.880
<v Speaker 3>stumbling over that.</v>

3016
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Also though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a lot of sadness to that life</v>

3017
02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:10.140
<v Speaker 3>for some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3018
02:15:10.141 --> 02:15:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3019
02:15:10.681 --> 02:15:12.220
<v Speaker 3>there's also when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

3020
02:15:12.221 --> 02:15:14.670
<v Speaker 3>when someone feels like they're getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>scammed over,</v>

3021
02:15:14.730 --> 02:15:16.170
<v Speaker 3>like you don't really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3022
02:15:16.530 --> 02:15:17.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

3023
02:15:17.550 --> 02:15:20.130
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone's in a situation where a girl</v>

3024
02:15:20.131 --> 02:15:22.200
<v Speaker 3>is using her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks to get by in life,</v>

3025
02:15:22.590 --> 02:15:26.820
<v Speaker 3>the guy who is taking advantage of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys who get with those girls,</v>

3026
02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:29.790
<v Speaker 3>they know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that this isn't a real,</v>

3027
02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:34.820
<v Speaker 3>this isn't a real love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a real love under certain </v>

3028
02:15:34.820 --> 02:15:36.630
<v Speaker 3>conditions and that certain conditions </v>
<v Speaker 3>are you're here to provide like finances</v>

3029
02:15:36.631 --> 02:15:41.631
<v Speaker 3>or pay for things or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something that those guys are </v>

3030
02:15:41.631 --> 02:15:44.541
<v Speaker 3>going to present that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that manipulative relationship is </v>

3031
02:15:44.541 --> 02:15:47.961
<v Speaker 3>never the real relationship where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really both truly love each other and </v>

3032
02:15:47.961 --> 02:15:50.160
<v Speaker 3>you can't wait to see that person.</v>

02:17:38.981 --> 02:17:41.560
<v Speaker 3>people enter those relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't enter them.</v>

3077
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:45.190
<v Speaker 3>They just don't even care about his </v>
<v Speaker 3>lungs.</v>

3078
02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:50.220
<v Speaker 3>He's body is an amazing person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His energy is so loving and you know,</v>

3079
02:17:50.410 --> 02:17:52.270
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to leave his side.</v>

3080
02:17:52.530 --> 02:17:53.900
<v Speaker 3>It sounds amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

3081
02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:58.950
<v Speaker 3>I hope to grow 81 day the girls got </v>
<v Speaker 3>diamonds on shit and she's just lying </v>

3082
02:17:58.950 --> 02:18:03.091
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>murdered the animal skins and driving </v>

3083
02:18:03.091 --> 02:18:04.470
<v Speaker 3>around in a Bentley feels like it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>even connected to the road.</v>

3084
02:18:04.471 --> 02:18:06.820
<v Speaker 3>I feel like you're floating on a carpet </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the air.</v>

3085
02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:12.000
<v Speaker 3>She knows he's probably only got two </v>
<v Speaker 3>more years of life and then she gets </v>

3086
02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:13.570
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars because he was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>love with her.</v>

3087
02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:16.060
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how many of those there are out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there a lot.</v>

3088
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:18.160
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say,</v>

3089
02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:23.280
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want it to be cynical and </v>

3090
02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:23.280
<v Speaker 3>pragmatic that you know he's providing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

3091
02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:25.270
<v Speaker 3>She's getting something out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good relationship.</v>

3092
02:18:25.271 --> 02:18:30.271
<v Speaker 3>He wants comfort and sex and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to sort of give that as long as </v>

3093
02:18:30.271 --> 02:18:34.051
<v Speaker 3>he provides a ridiculous income to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the reason why they have this </v>

3094
02:18:34.210 --> 02:18:35.950
<v Speaker 3>unbalanced relationship in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

3095
02:18:35.951 --> 02:18:39.760
<v Speaker 3>He has to be unbalanced financially to </v>
<v Speaker 3>overcompensate for the physical,</v>

3096
02:18:39.761 --> 02:18:42.130
<v Speaker 3>unbalanced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to be ridiculous on balance.</v>

3097
02:18:42.340 --> 02:18:47.340
<v Speaker 3>He asked to be buying or minks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>diamonds and then you get to stick your </v>

3098
02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Dick in my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like diamonds and that's,</v>

3099
02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:51.970
<v Speaker 3>that's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has them so they could say,</v>

3100
02:18:51.971 --> 02:18:56.971
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was using her or she was using him </v>

3101
02:18:56.971 --> 02:18:56.971
<v Speaker 3>for his money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

3102
02:18:56.971 --> 02:18:56.971
<v Speaker 3>That's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3103
02:18:56.971 --> 02:19:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Using him for his money and he's using </v>
<v Speaker 3>her for her great hot body.</v>

3104
02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:02.350
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to get this when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 80.</v>

3105
02:19:02.860 --> 02:19:07.860
<v Speaker 3>It's essentially what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking on an insane prostitution </v>

3106
02:19:07.860 --> 02:19:12.190
<v Speaker 3>contract that you almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like almost nobody could keep up with.</v>

3107
02:19:12.670 --> 02:19:14.680
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way you can keep a hot </v>
<v Speaker 3>chick if you're 80.</v>

3108
02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just incredible to think of that.</v>

3109
02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:21.460
<v Speaker 3>Eighty year olds can get that horny man </v>
<v Speaker 3>if they take Viagra.</v>

3110
02:19:22.330 --> 02:19:24.280
<v Speaker 3>And I think also if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3111
02:19:24.460 --> 02:19:26.770
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a psychological thing.</v>

3112
02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:27.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's</v>

3113
02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:33.000
<v Speaker 2>a lot of 80 year old guys that can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that they can get a 20 year old </v>

3114
02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:34.340
<v Speaker 2>hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably can't even believe it.</v>

3115
02:19:34.610 --> 02:19:37.370
<v Speaker 2>And when they're alone with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can get it up still,</v>

3116
02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:42.460
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how good must've feel to bang some </v>

3117
02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:45.140
<v Speaker 2>really hard 20 year old Russian hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of fucked up because he's only</v>

3118
02:19:45.141 --> 02:19:46.280
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's make her 23.</v>

3119
02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's make it 23.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really hot.</v>

3120
02:19:49.311 --> 02:19:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Twenty three year old Russian hooker </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's really good at it.</v>

3121
02:19:52.401 --> 02:19:54.980
<v Speaker 2>She's really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just have to like you just.</v>

3122
02:19:55.070 --> 02:20:00.070
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact that underneath this </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful young thing is a withered </v>

3123
02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:03.701
<v Speaker 2>Chris that's about to go feed the worms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it would be tough for me to </v>

3124
02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:06.890
<v Speaker 2>beat that out of my mind as I stared at </v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

3125
02:20:07.370 --> 02:20:08.720
<v Speaker 2>at her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at her hot body.</v>

3126
02:20:08.721 --> 02:20:09.740
<v Speaker 2>I would still be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3127
02:20:09.741 --> 02:20:10.280
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking.</v>

3128
02:20:10.290 --> 02:20:15.290
<v Speaker 2>You're wrinkling and you can barely </v>
<v Speaker 2>breathe and your knees or to so good.</v>

3129
02:20:17.930 --> 02:20:22.930
<v Speaker 2>God damn this feel so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can come in her mouth.</v>

3130
02:20:23.290 --> 02:20:24.650
<v Speaker 2>You can come in around whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

3131
02:20:24.651 --> 02:20:26.150
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to come?</v>

3132
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Whether you want to come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said he's.</v>

3133
02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:30.260
<v Speaker 2>He's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

3134
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:34.970
<v Speaker 2>More power to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he should give up his whole empire.</v>

3135
02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.520
<v Speaker 2>He's not gonna live very long anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just keep it all up.</v>

3136
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>

3137
02:20:38.421 --> 02:20:39.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that situation,</v>

3138
02:20:39.861 --> 02:20:41.770
<v Speaker 2>there certainly is something for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

3139
02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:44.960
<v Speaker 2>that's priceless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's worth a lot of goddamn money.</v>

3140
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A girl,</v>

3141
02:20:45.741 --> 02:20:50.741
<v Speaker 2>a really hot check to just fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you want and you're an 80 year </v>

3142
02:20:50.741 --> 02:20:52.250
<v Speaker 2>old man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better be paying that bitch.</v>

3143
02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:55.250
<v Speaker 2>That's a ridiculous thing to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think it's tough to ask them to be a</v>

3144
02:20:55.251 --> 02:21:00.251
<v Speaker 2>garbage man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about asking a fucking old guy </v>

3145
02:21:00.251 --> 02:21:00.251
<v Speaker 2>whenever he wants?</v>

3146
02:21:00.251 --> 02:21:03.500
<v Speaker 2>You think there's any like 80 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's any 80 year old </v>

3147
02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:04.940
<v Speaker 2>guys living in studio apartments that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have 30 year old girlfriends?</v>

3148
02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:07.730
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3149
02:21:07.731 --> 02:21:11.300
<v Speaker 2>there's none of that doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there might be a few broken chicks</v>

3150
02:21:11.301 --> 02:21:14.570
<v Speaker 2>out there that you got roped into some </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad poetry or something like that.</v>

3151
02:21:15.490 --> 02:21:18.200
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most guys though,</v>

3152
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:22.570
<v Speaker 2>roped in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guy pretends to be good.</v>

3153
02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:27.580
<v Speaker 2>You've been lost girl and you know he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a information he has no.</v>

3154
02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:32.650
<v Speaker 2>He takes time with her and something no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one ever did and he has needs and she </v>

3155
02:21:32.650 --> 02:21:34.190
<v Speaker 2>takes care of it for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's possible most of the time.</v>

3156
02:21:34.191 --> 02:21:39.191
<v Speaker 2>Not Likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time it's a motherfucker </v>

3157
02:21:39.191 --> 02:21:42.581
<v Speaker 2>that's living in some shit that nobody </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be living in some crazy fucking </v>

3158
02:21:42.581 --> 02:21:43.430
<v Speaker 2>castle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some.</v>

3159
02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:43.950
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3160
02:21:44.060 --> 02:21:49.060
<v Speaker 2>every now and then as a goof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to go on a website and look at </v>

3161
02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:50.330
<v Speaker 2>like stupid expensive houses that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>for sale.</v>

3162
02:21:50.450 --> 02:21:52.540
<v Speaker 2>Like what is the most expensive house </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could buy,</v>

3163
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:56.060
<v Speaker 2>like $20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollar houses and you can go and</v>

3164
02:21:56.061 --> 02:22:01.061
<v Speaker 2>look at the pictures of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They show them online and you see the </v>

3165
02:22:01.061 --> 02:22:03.521
<v Speaker 2>grounds and everything like holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what is this crazy way that one </v>

3166
02:22:03.521 --> 02:22:05.540
<v Speaker 2>person gets to live?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is nuts.</v>

3167
02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:08.510
<v Speaker 2>I looked at this one house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a compound.</v>

3168
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:14.110
<v Speaker 2>It was absolutely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was 600 plus acres and this </v>

3169
02:22:14.110 --> 02:22:18.851
<v Speaker 2>incredible fucking house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it was one of the most </v>

3170
02:22:18.851 --> 02:22:22.150
<v Speaker 2>extravagant things that a person could </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever purchase an urn and own in their </v>

3171
02:22:22.150 --> 02:22:26.891
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They essentially own a kingdom was </v>

3172
02:22:26.891 --> 02:22:26.891
<v Speaker 2>really like a 650 acre</v>

3173
02:22:26.891 --> 02:22:28.160
<v Speaker 3>kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3174
02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:28.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3175
02:22:28.811 --> 02:22:31.320
<v Speaker 3>it was a little chippy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's 26,</v>

3176
02:22:31.321 --> 02:22:34.340
<v Speaker 3>she just came here from Czechoslovakia </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3177
02:22:34.350 --> 02:22:38.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we started hanging out man and she likes</v>

3178
02:22:38.071 --> 02:22:43.071
<v Speaker 3>to smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still smoke a little weed every now </v>

<v Speaker 3>know what to do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm a mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 86 years old.</v>

3182
02:22:45.930 --> 02:22:48.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of relationship we're going to</v>

3183
02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:49.200
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3184
02:22:49.201 --> 02:22:50.640

3228
02:24:49.741 --> 02:24:51.490
<v Speaker 3>up when you're blinking out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>

3229
02:24:51.491 --> 02:24:56.491
<v Speaker 3>like you can actually blink out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe and a silk robe next to a 30 </v>

3230
02:24:56.581 --> 02:25:01.150
<v Speaker 3>year old Russian stripper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a man who was a um,</v>

3231
02:25:01.330 --> 02:25:03.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a successful man,</v>

3232
02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:05.250
<v Speaker 3>but he was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very weak.</v>

3233
02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:09.120
<v Speaker 3>He was like very physically weak and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was much older than her.</v>

3234
02:25:09.570 --> 02:25:12.710
<v Speaker 3>He was about 30 years older than her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3235
02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:14.040
<v Speaker 3>he was maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3236
02:25:14.041 --> 02:25:19.041
<v Speaker 3>she was like in her probably in her </v>
<v Speaker 3>forties and he was in his seventies and </v>

3237
02:25:19.470 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 3>there was the anger from her at him and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way she would yell at him</v>

3238
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:29.070
<v Speaker 8>and treat him this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this complete total lack of respect </v>

3239
02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:29.560
<v Speaker 8>because,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3240
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:32.320
<v Speaker 8>basically they're the.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They had been married for a long time.</v>

3241
02:25:32.350 --> 02:25:37.350
<v Speaker 8>The only reason why they got married in </v>
<v Speaker 8>the first place is because he was rich </v>

3242
02:25:37.350 --> 02:25:37.350
<v Speaker 8>and she was hot and she learned along </v>
<v Speaker 8>the way.</v>

3243
02:25:37.350 --> 02:25:38.890
<v Speaker 8>This motherfucker's not going to do </v>
<v Speaker 8>nothing,</v>

3244
02:25:38.891 --> 02:25:43.891
<v Speaker 8>and the way to get them off you is to </v>
<v Speaker 8>just yell at them and humiliate them in </v>

3245
02:25:43.891 --> 02:25:44.230
<v Speaker 8>front of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Will you fucking stop?</v>

3246
02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:47.020
<v Speaker 8>Just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 8>She was this Russian lady,</v>

3247
02:25:47.410 --> 02:25:52.410
<v Speaker 8>Judy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>She yelled at him in front of me and my </v>

3248
02:25:52.410 --> 02:25:53.410
<v Speaker 8>friends and it was this really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 8>super uncomfortable moment,</v>

3249
02:25:53.411 --> 02:25:58.411
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just snapped at him in front of </v>

3250
02:25:58.411 --> 02:25:58.420
<v Speaker 8>everybody and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we had a peak at this guy's life.</v>

3251
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:59.190
<v Speaker 8>What,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what,</v>

3252
02:25:59.220 --> 02:25:59.900
<v Speaker 8>what,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what did he,</v>

3253
02:25:59.940 --> 02:26:01.510
<v Speaker 8>what did he done?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was so bad.</v>

3254
02:26:01.511 --> 02:26:02.170
<v Speaker 8>Do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

3255
02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:03.400
<v Speaker 8>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nothing.</v>

3256
02:26:03.401 --> 02:26:04.660
<v Speaker 8>At the time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was a really nice guy.</v>

3257
02:26:04.661 --> 02:26:06.900
<v Speaker 8>He was a doctor and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he made,</v>

3258
02:26:06.970 --> 02:26:08.020
<v Speaker 8>made them a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Man.</v>

3259
02:26:08.050 --> 02:26:13.050
<v Speaker 8>He was rich.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He had a crazy house and crazy cars and </v>

3260
02:26:13.050 --> 02:26:15.760
<v Speaker 8>shit and she was like a really hot </v>
<v Speaker 8>Soviet bloc looking chick.</v>

3261
02:26:15.970 --> 02:26:20.970
<v Speaker 8>I don't remember what,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what part of what part of the Soviet </v>

3262
02:26:20.970 --> 02:26:20.970
<v Speaker 8>Union or Russia or whatever she was </v>
<v Speaker 8>from.</v>

3263
02:26:20.970 --> 02:26:23.920
<v Speaker 8>But it was something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't remember Ukraine.</v>

3264
02:26:23.950 --> 02:26:24.610
<v Speaker 8>She might've.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3265
02:26:24.611 --> 02:26:27.230
<v Speaker 8>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't remember fucking tragic dude.</v>

3266
02:26:27.231 --> 02:26:32.231
<v Speaker 8>It's so tragic and it's tragic when </v>
<v Speaker 8>someone's with someone and that person </v>

3267
02:26:32.231 --> 02:26:33.330
<v Speaker 8>doesn't want to be with your man or give</v>
<v Speaker 8>away,</v>

3268
02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:36.940
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>love and like these little like rations,</v>

3269
02:26:37.210 --> 02:26:39.580
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they give a sex and affection and little</v>

3270
02:26:39.581 --> 02:26:40.840
<v Speaker 8>rations,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>

3271
02:26:40.930 --> 02:26:42.820
<v Speaker 8>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's like that thing they experiment.</v>

3272
02:26:42.821 --> 02:26:43.890
<v Speaker 8>They did with the monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3273
02:26:43.891 --> 02:26:46.020
<v Speaker 8>but it's like one of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 8>experiments of all time.</v>

3274
02:26:46.090 --> 02:26:51.090
<v Speaker 8>They take a fucking wire monkey and </v>
<v Speaker 8>there's those pictures of the monkeys </v>

3275
02:26:51.090 --> 02:26:55.210
<v Speaker 8>leaning to the wire monkey in pretending</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a real monkey on it.</v>

3276
02:26:55.211 --> 02:27:00.211
<v Speaker 8>They put carpet on it and they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they had this poor monkey that thought </v>

3277
02:27:00.211 --> 02:27:01.010
<v Speaker 8>it was a mama.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was nothing else in there for it.</v>

3278
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:06.750
<v Speaker 8>But some people are in relationships </v>
<v Speaker 8>where there that little fucking monkey </v>

3279
02:27:06.750 --> 02:27:11.160
<v Speaker 8>and they're clinging onto nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's nothing there and they're just </v>

3280
02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:11.800
<v Speaker 8>pretending that there's love.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's something there for them.</v>

3281
02:27:11.801 --> 02:27:14.740
<v Speaker 8>And they know in their heart there's </v>
<v Speaker 8>nothing there and they just keep fucking</v>

3282
02:27:14.741 --> 02:27:19.741
<v Speaker 8>doing it because they're terrified to </v>
<v Speaker 8>let go of that fucking thing and go out </v>

3283
02:27:19.741 --> 02:27:23.461
<v Speaker 8>into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's super hard to find someone that's </v>

3284
02:27:23.461 --> 02:27:25.360
<v Speaker 8>really cool to hang out with.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That doesn't just become a shithead.</v>

3285
02:27:25.361 --> 02:27:29.440
<v Speaker 8>Eventually someone just someone who </v>
<v Speaker 8>doesn't fall apart after you get to know</v>

3286
02:27:29.441 --> 02:27:30.220
<v Speaker 8>them for awhile.</v>

3287
02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:32.200
<v Speaker 8>Because that happens with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>

3288
02:27:32.201 --> 02:27:37.201
<v Speaker 8>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a lot of people do really good in the </v>

3289
02:27:37.201 --> 02:27:37.201
<v Speaker 8>beginning of a relationship because they</v>
<v Speaker 8>can pretend to be someone really cool.</v>

3290
02:27:37.201 --> 02:27:37.870
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

3291
02:27:38.110 --> 02:27:40.740
<v Speaker 8>And then as time goes on you realize </v>
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

3292
02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:43.600
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's tired and she's a bitch,</v>

3293
02:27:43.601 --> 02:27:44.780
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why you negative to,</v>

3294
02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:46.090
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're always negative.</v>

3295
02:27:46.091 --> 02:27:47.500
<v Speaker 8>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3296
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:52.590
<v Speaker 8>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That thing when you stop acting and you </v>

3297
02:27:52.590 --> 02:27:54.850
<v Speaker 8>ended up meeting the real person.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that can either be.</v>

3298
02:27:55.390 --> 02:27:57.700
<v Speaker 8>Hopefully that moment should be </v>
<v Speaker 8>wonderful.</v>

3299
02:27:57.701 --> 02:28:00.820
<v Speaker 8>Like when the fucking guard comes down </v>
<v Speaker 8>and you really see the person,</v>

3300
02:28:00.821 --> 02:28:03.850
<v Speaker 8>there should be some beautiful thing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but sometimes it's not.</v>

3301
02:28:03.970 --> 02:28:08.970
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Or sometimes one mask comes off and </v>

3302
02:28:08.970 --> 02:28:08.970
<v Speaker 8>there's just another one there,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's,</v>

3303
02:28:08.970 --> 02:28:13.710
<v Speaker 8>it's like all of us are wandering around</v>
<v Speaker 8>right now in that state that we're </v>

3304
02:28:13.710 --> 02:28:18.121
<v Speaker 8>putting on his show,</v>
<v Speaker 8>pretending to be as they're pretending </v>

3305
02:28:18.121 --> 02:28:18.121
<v Speaker 8>to be hoping to try to fake it till you </v>
<v Speaker 8>make it.</v>

3306
02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:22.400
<v Speaker 8>There's some of that going on to you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've said</v>

3307
02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:25.760
<v Speaker 3>often on this show that my best advice </v>
<v Speaker 3>to someone else.</v>

3308
02:28:25.761 --> 02:28:30.761
<v Speaker 3>Pretend to be the guy or be the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather that you pretend to be when </v>

3309
02:28:30.761 --> 02:28:32.030
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just be that guy.</v>

3310
02:28:32.930 --> 02:28:34.210
<v Speaker 3>Be that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be that,</v>

3311
02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.850
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>

3312
02:28:34.851 --> 02:28:36.740
<v Speaker 3>When you're trying to impress a chick </v>
<v Speaker 3>with how cool you are,</v>

3313
02:28:37.100 --> 02:28:40.310
<v Speaker 3>be that guy for real CFA person know </v>
<v Speaker 3>become the.</v>

3314
02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:43.490
<v Speaker 3>Hold yourself to a higher standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold yourself to a standard.</v>

3315
02:28:43.491 --> 02:28:46.580
<v Speaker 3>That's admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people just act on instinct and</v>

3316
02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:49.730
<v Speaker 3>they don't ever look at their life from </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a point of view,</v>

3317
02:28:49.731 --> 02:28:54.731
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would I be impressed with if </v>

3318
02:28:54.731 --> 02:28:54.731
<v Speaker 3>someone handled this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it?</v>

3319
02:28:54.731 --> 02:28:56.770
<v Speaker 3>What would be the most moral and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>coolest,</v>

3320
02:28:56.790 --> 02:29:00.560
<v Speaker 3>nicest thing to do here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most admirable thing to do and when,</v>

3321
02:29:00.610 --> 02:29:04.340
<v Speaker 3>when you become capable of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you become capable of,</v>

3322
02:29:04.390 --> 02:29:06.410
<v Speaker 3>of looking at your whole life through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3323
02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:08.660
<v Speaker 3>like almost an objective perspective.</v>

3324
02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:13.780
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you ever heard of something called </v>

3325
02:29:13.780 --> 02:29:13.780
<v Speaker 4>transactional analysis or game theory?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard of this sort of game</v>

3326
02:29:13.780 --> 02:29:18.761
<v Speaker 4>theory?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know it was transactional </v>

3327
02:29:18.761 --> 02:29:18.761
<v Speaker 4>analysis ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3328
02:29:18.761 --> 02:29:22.601
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an analysis of the transactions </v>

3329
02:29:22.601 --> 02:29:23.290
<v Speaker 4>that happen between people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what they.</v>

3330
02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:23.400
<v Speaker 4>Right</v>

3331
02:29:24.210 --> 02:29:26.730
<v Speaker 3>something to do with the guy from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3332
02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:28.650
<v Speaker 3>a brilliant mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3333
02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:32.400
<v Speaker 3>isn't it that the Nobel prize I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>was on.</v>

3334
02:29:32.610 --> 02:29:33.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

3335
02:29:33.650 --> 02:29:38.650
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm reading a book called the Games </v>

3336
02:29:38.650 --> 02:29:40.740
<v Speaker 4>people play and it's like an analysis of</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the basic games that we play,</v>

3337
02:29:40.741 --> 02:29:45.741
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like shaking hands is a game where the </v>

3338
02:29:45.741 --> 02:29:48.561
<v Speaker 4>rules of the game or you're kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 4>transmitting a what I think what they </v>

3339
02:29:48.561 --> 02:29:50.880
<v Speaker 4>call a token.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like if I come up to you and I extend</v>

3340
02:29:50.881 --> 02:29:55.620
<v Speaker 4>my hand for you to shake my hand and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't shake my hand,</v>

3341
02:29:55.830 --> 02:30:00.830
<v Speaker 4>then that creates a weird moment because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you haven't made it a complete </v>

3342
02:30:00.830 --> 02:30:00.870
<v Speaker 4>transaction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3343
02:30:00.900 --> 02:30:01.980
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

3344
02:30:02.130 --> 02:30:07.130
<v Speaker 4>So it's like it's an analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything at that level and it just </v>

3345
02:30:07.130 --> 02:30:10.050
<v Speaker 4>sort of comes back that we're all </v>
<v Speaker 4>engaged in these weird games.</v>

3346
02:30:10.080 --> 02:30:11.000
<v Speaker 4>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3347
02:30:11.010 --> 02:30:16.010
<v Speaker 4>whether you're acting like you're the </v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest person on a date or whether </v>

3348
02:30:16.010 --> 02:30:18.570
<v Speaker 4>you're acting like you're some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>weak person who is always broke and it's</v>

3349
02:30:18.571 --> 02:30:23.571
<v Speaker 4>always in bad relationships or whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're acting like you're a priest or </v>

3350
02:30:23.571 --> 02:30:24.510
<v Speaker 4>whether you're acting like you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fucking thing is.</v>

3351
02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:29.660
<v Speaker 4>You're just playing a game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just playing the game of being </v>

3352
02:30:29.660 --> 02:30:29.660
<v Speaker 4>this person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3353
02:30:29.660 --> 02:30:32.740
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're all in the kind of endless,</v>

3354
02:30:33.420 --> 02:30:37.350
<v Speaker 4>absurd situation of having to pretend to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be something,</v>

3355
02:30:37.351 --> 02:30:39.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is like fucking waiters,</v>

3356
02:30:39.720 --> 02:30:43.470
<v Speaker 4>like would it or what anyone you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>buying anything from there having to act</v>

3357
02:30:43.471 --> 02:30:47.160
<v Speaker 4>in this weird way called professional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're just acting like who is this</v>

3358
02:30:47.161 --> 02:30:48.060
<v Speaker 4>character?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a character.</v>

3359
02:30:48.061 --> 02:30:49.860
<v Speaker 4>You're playing a weird character of </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who's like,</v>

3360
02:30:50.100 --> 02:30:50.940
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3361
02:30:50.941 --> 02:30:54.810
<v Speaker 4>May I get you another drink like tv host</v>
<v Speaker 4>or a strip club dj?</v>

3362
02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:55.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or,</v>

3363
02:30:55.981 --> 02:30:57.930
<v Speaker 4>or just almost anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

3364
02:30:58.230 --> 02:31:00.510
<v Speaker 4>it's just the things that people think </v>
<v Speaker 4>are themselves.</v>

3365
02:31:00.511 --> 02:31:05.511
<v Speaker 4>This is who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the rolling stones and I really </v>

3366
02:31:05.511 --> 02:31:06.150
<v Speaker 4>enjoy fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3367
02:31:06.151 --> 02:31:08.130
<v Speaker 4>is that really you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's who you are.</v>

3368
02:31:08.280 --> 02:31:12.420
<v Speaker 4>That's your identity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you like get far enough back,</v>

3369
02:31:12.421 --> 02:31:17.421
<v Speaker 4>you'll realize that that's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just a game that you're playing </v>

3370
02:31:17.421 --> 02:31:19.410
<v Speaker 4>and you can keep going back and back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>back until you emerge and everything,</v>

3371
02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:20.160
<v Speaker 4>but we.</v>

3372
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to stay as the fucking </v>

3373
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.190
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to.</v>

3374
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:29.720
<v Speaker 2>Everyone wants a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly comfort in predetermined </v>

3375
02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:29.720
<v Speaker 2>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3376
02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:30.030
<v Speaker 2>the people love to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

3377
02:31:30.031 --> 02:31:32.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I vote.</v>

3378
02:31:32.220 --> 02:31:34.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm voting for George W.</v>

3379
02:31:34.590 --> 02:31:35.660
<v Speaker 2>he's my guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3380
02:31:35.700 --> 02:31:38.370
<v Speaker 2>people love to be part of teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do that.</v>

3381
02:31:38.390 --> 02:31:43.390
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to back up the way </v>

3382
02:31:43.390 --> 02:31:43.390
<v Speaker 2>you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3383
02:31:43.390 --> 02:31:46.450
<v Speaker 2>it's like to do it without help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To do it without either psychedelic help</v>

3384
02:31:46.451 --> 02:31:51.451
<v Speaker 2>but to do it without some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>intense meditation and Yoga and training</v>

3385
02:31:51.541 --> 02:31:54.420
<v Speaker 2>and that's like a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really difficult.</v>

3386
02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:56.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a difficult task,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's the.</v>

3387
02:31:56.280 --> 02:32:01.280
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you begin to engage in </v>

3388
02:32:01.280 --> 02:32:01.280
<v Speaker 2>people are going to get better at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hell yes,</v>

3389
02:32:01.280 --> 02:32:02.730
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

3390
02:32:02.940 --> 02:32:05.430
<v Speaker 2>People are going to get better because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the information is getting out there.</v>

3391
02:32:05.430 --> 02:32:10.430
<v Speaker 2>There's so many information systems out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that back in the pool of thousands</v>

3392
02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:12.540
<v Speaker 2>of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't have books.</v>

3393
02:32:12.541 --> 02:32:13.800
<v Speaker 2>There weren't even books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

3394
02:32:13.801 --> 02:32:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I was very difficult to get a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Books were incredibly valuable.</v>

3395
02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Now this shit is scattered throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire fucking planet.</v>

3396
02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:23.850
<v Speaker 2>You have instantaneous access to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

3397
02:32:23.910 --> 02:32:25.200
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3398
02:32:25.201 --> 02:32:27.030
<v Speaker 2>I think people are going to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>profit.</v>

3399
02:32:27.031 --> 02:32:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Brendan Walsh just walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which a ends ends his podcast.</v>

3400
02:32:31.201 --> 02:32:33.150

<v Speaker 2>after this.</v>

3401
02:32:33.570 --> 02:32:36.330
<v Speaker 2>We're going to start the dusk squad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Icehouse chronicles,</v>

3402
02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:38.190
<v Speaker 2>because the comics are starting to pilot</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the show.</v>

3403
02:32:38.480 --> 02:32:41.220
<v Speaker 2>It is already 9:30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3404
02:32:41.221 --> 02:32:43.500
<v Speaker 2>it was John Nash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy from them,</v>

3405
02:32:43.501 --> 02:32:48.501
<v Speaker 2>when we have brilliant mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did win a some sort of a Nobel prize </v>

3406
02:32:48.501 --> 02:32:50.640
<v Speaker 2>on a game theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I dunno some along those lines.</v>

3407
02:32:50.641 --> 02:32:52.110
<v Speaker 2>He went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a guy that went nutty.</v>

3408
02:32:52.170 --> 02:32:53.070
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know he went crazy.</v>

3409
02:32:53.230 --> 02:32:58.230
<v Speaker 2>That's the movie about what it was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>WHO's the guy who's the guy who played a</v>

3410
02:32:59.490 --> 02:33:01.890
<v Speaker 2>beautiful mind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gladiator.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Russell Crowe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3412
02:33:03.540 --> 02:33:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant performance,</v>

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3462
02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I think that helps us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it helps me.</v>

3463
02:35:07.991 --> 02:35:10.540
<v Speaker 3>I know these conversations have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge for,</v>

3464
02:35:10.750 --> 02:35:15.750
<v Speaker 3>for breaking things down for me and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of reassembling the way I look at </v>

<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3467
02:35:18.991 --> 02:35:23.991
<v Speaker 3>all these different people and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>really different intelligent people and </v>

3468
02:35:23.991 --> 02:35:26.380
<v Speaker 3>really intense opinions and it's super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super beneficial man.</v>

3469
02:35:26.381 --> 02:35:29.470
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just so happy that we're able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do this.</v>

3470
02:35:29.471 --> 02:35:31.300
<v Speaker 3>I is the fucking coolest thing I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

3471
02:35:31.301 --> 02:35:32.350
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really enjoy it.</v>

3472
02:35:32.660 --> 02:35:34.660
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost right up there with standup.</v>

3473
02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:38.440
<v Speaker 3>Standup will always be like the sacred </v>
<v Speaker 3>top of the food chain,</v>

3474
02:35:39.310 --> 02:35:40.960
<v Speaker 3>but it's pretty close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really cool.</v>

3475
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:46.110
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why it's cool is how many</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool people it impacts and how many cool</v>

3476
02:35:46.331 --> 02:35:50.680
<v Speaker 3>people who had impacts share their love </v>
<v Speaker 3>with us and send that love back at us.</v>

3477
02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:55.680
<v Speaker 3>And we appreciate the fuck out of it.</v>

02:36:02.110 --> 02:36:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Staying with us since the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it was ridiculous that anybody </v>

3481
02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:07.720
<v Speaker 3>would give us money for this stupid </v>

<v Speaker 3>times and take a shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>sort of just built up on itself </v>

3492
02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:33.730
<v Speaker 3>naturally and we love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We couldn't be happier.</v>

3493
02:36:33.731 --> 02:36:38.731
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always wanted to have a radio show </v>

3494
02:36:38.731 --> 02:36:38.731
<v Speaker 3>and I never could get anybody to even </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about giving me one,</v>

3495
02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:43.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I really want to get up every </v>

<v Speaker 3>the best shit I've ever done.</v>

3505
02:37:02.690 --> 02:37:05.800
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing a lot of standup lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the groove,</v>

3506
02:37:05.801 --> 02:37:08.530
<v Speaker 3>like we had a great time this weekend at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the county of Magic Club.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like it might be a huge problem with no </v>

<v Speaker 2>going to be crazy.</v>

3512
02:37:22.401 --> 02:37:25.340
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been worn 19 times on twitter about</v>

3513
02:37:25.341 --> 02:37:30.341
<v Speaker 2>this event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said I should put a TV onstage </v>

3514
02:37:30.341 --> 02:37:31.550
<v Speaker 2>while the game is on and allow people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch it while we talk.</v>

3515
02:37:31.580 --> 02:37:33.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally cool with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

3516
02:37:33.081 --> 02:37:34.570
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking blast.</v>

3517
02:37:34.750 --> 02:37:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be fun.</v>

3518
02:37:37.220 --> 02:37:42.220
<v Speaker 2>It'd be fun because I don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck is going on and I want them to </v>

3519
02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:42.750
<v Speaker 2>stop this nonsense game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We please do that.</v>

3520
02:37:43.630 --> 02:37:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3522
02:37:45.951 --> 02:37:47.810

<v Speaker 2>to the show too.</v>

3523
02:37:47.811 --> 02:37:49.520
<v Speaker 2>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the Improv can figure that out,</v>
