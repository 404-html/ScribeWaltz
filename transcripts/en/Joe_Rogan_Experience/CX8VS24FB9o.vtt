1
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>There's not a week that goes by that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get an email,</v>

2
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:13.461
<v Speaker 1>a phone call from a random person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants advice on how to enter the</v>

3
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>nonprofit sector in the unit to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>career in the nonprofit sector,</v>

4
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they think it's where they can</v>

5
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>find the most fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is really inspiring to see so</v>

6
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>from young people to mid career</v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals,</v>

8
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>even retired professionals wanting to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the social impact space because say</v>

9
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.460
<v Speaker 1>are convinced that this is where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would find the most fulfillment.</v>

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reverse can be true as well because</v>

12
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>burnout in the nonprofit sector is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very real thing.</v>

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

14
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I once had the conversation with a group</v>

15
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 1>of monastics from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>the group of teak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not Han who said that the people who</v>

17
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 1>visit their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.200
<v Speaker 1>their monastery in France too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take some time off on a retreat are</v>

19
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:10.500
<v Speaker 1>mostly coming from the nonprofit sector</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they become so burnt out.</v>

20
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>They become so disillusioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become just so fatigued by the</v>

21
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>causes of the nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 1>at tvt that is required of them.</v>

23
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>But I have also encountered so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who,</v>

24
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they barely make a living and</v>

25
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they make their living exposes</v>

26
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>them to the most miserable conditions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the planet where there's,</v>

27
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>there's abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a war,</v>

28
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>there's hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's poverty and there's not even a</v>

29
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>comfortable place to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is it,</v>

30
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:48.130
<v Speaker 1>what is it about these people that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that keep,</v>

31
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.561
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

32
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>what is it that keeps him happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless?</v>

33
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>And there are a few things that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned.</v>

34
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>This is among the people who actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose to be in the nonprofit sector.</v>

35
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 1>One is that they have a life outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their work.</v>

36
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:00.191
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

37
00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>they do not associate themselves with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cause.</v>

38
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>They are not the cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they actually have an identity</v>

39
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>outside of their work and they treat it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a job like any other.</v>

40
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I saw in these people is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

41
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think when,</v>

42
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:17.521
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>when you're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in a situation where you're</v>

44
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>constantly asking people for help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly fundraising,</v>

45
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly asking for support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sign this petition to donate to this</v>

47
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>cause it then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to feel that you are in a</v>

48
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>position of need all the time.</v>

49
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's wrong because that can make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel really depleted.</v>

50
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 1>What I saw in these people is that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>may see themselves as having something</v>

51
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>to offer all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't see themselves as a needy</v>

52
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>one in every situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually see themselves as able to</v>

53
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>give something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give something in return,</v>

54
00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>and that empowers them in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

55
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I noticed about people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are working in very,</v>

56
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.360
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.160
<v Speaker 1>miserable situations but nevertheless</v>
<v Speaker 1>find so much fulfillment is that they</v>

58
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>they find strength in their group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never do it alone and they don't</v>

60
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:20.191
<v Speaker 1>have what I call the founder's syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when you're too close to the</v>

61
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.330
<v Speaker 1>essay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nonprofit that you started,</v>

62
00:03:23.331 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>or the cause that your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your name,</v>

63
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stands for,</v>

64
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>it becomes your identity and it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

66
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.770
<v Speaker 1>too closely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>entangled with every single thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

68
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people I learned who,</v>

69
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>who maintain a healthy balance or those</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are able to take a step back and</v>

70
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>still enjoy things outside of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

71
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
