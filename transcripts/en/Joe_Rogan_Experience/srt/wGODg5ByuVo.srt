1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,040
Powerful job.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:02,730
Here we go.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,563
Four,

4
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,853
three,

5
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,963
two.

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,760
Hello events or what's going on my friend.

7
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,601
Not much.

8
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:12,120
My man.

9
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,680
That shirt.

10
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,101
What is it?

11
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:13,261
Uh,

12
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:13,761
a moon.

13
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:14,594
Smiley face.

14
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,950
Graffiti and the moon.

15
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:16,863
Oh,

16
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,290
you know me and my smiley faces.

17
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:18,470
Yeah.

18
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,120
People would graffiti the moon.

19
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,330
That's probably the first thing I'm
going to have to worry about these virgin

20
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:23,780
flights.

21
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,710
They're planning on people leaving some
shit that you could see from Earth.

22
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,540
Yeah.

23
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,373
Pissing everywhere.

24
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,621
Dude.

25
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:31,550
So much to talk about.

26
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,630
So much going on.

27
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,190
There's a lot going on in the world
of MMA in the world of Doug Jitsu,

28
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,820
your world,

29
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,780
mma,

30
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,650
even boxing.

31
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,220
There's a Lotta,

32
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:40,891
a Lotta shit going on.

33
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:41,480
A boxing.

34
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,470
It looks like we're going to get beyond
deontay wilder on Monday's going to be

35
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:45,890
in here.

36
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,510
Oh yeah,

37
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:46,771
yeah.

38
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:47,360
He's uh,

39
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,050
he's saying that.

40
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,420
Did you see the video on his instagram?

41
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,760
He shows that it's more than 10 seconds.

42
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,570
Yeah,

43
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,310
it is.

44
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,143
It's fact.

45
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,720
And he plays the clock.

46
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:59,900
As soon as Tyson fury goes down and
then it's more than 10 seconds before he

47
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:00,620
gets back up.

48
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,060
The only problem with that is,

49
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,540
I mean,

50
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,590
it's human error,

51
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:03,940
right?

52
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,600
You can start immediately,

53
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,690
you know,

54
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,580
there's always that little,

55
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,410
that little space and ties and they're
supposed to be a guy on the sidelines

56
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:10,611
though.

57
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:11,550
That starts the camera.

58
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,560
Yep.

59
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,780
And then he picks it up with five fort,

60
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,623
right?

61
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:15,981
Yeah.

62
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:17,660
But the problem is referees,

63
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,560
you know,

64
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,150
when they're in the heat of the battle,

65
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,640
the fucking adrenaline there seconds.

66
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:25,130
It's not like they have a
stopwatch in their hand to hit it.

67
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:26,150
Every time a guy goes down,

68
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:26,331
which,

69
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:27,290
why don't they have

70
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,720
Paula?

71
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,770
It's too much to remember.

72
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,330
We just talked about
the heat of the moment.

73
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,050
Boom.

74
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,883
Click.

75
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,540
Is that too much to remember?

76
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:36,471
I mean,

77
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:41,180
think about all the Shit Tyson
furious to American steak.

78
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,103
Right?

79
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,500
If you're in that fight,

80
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,060
I wanted,

81
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,490
of course,

82
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,580
I'm rooting for awhile
there because I like,

83
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,570
I like big knockouts,

84
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,453
you know what I mean?

85
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,363
And um,

86
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,890
he looked good in the first two rounds.

87
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,010
Then he just looked like he abandoned
the game plan and he was just looking for

88
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:58,970
the knockout after that.

89
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,600
Well,

90
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,020
he,

91
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,280
he's got a problem.

92
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,130
The problem is he can
knock anybody the fuck out.

93
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,300
That's a problem.

94
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,820
Anybody except that guy said Tyson theory.

95
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,920
It seems like you almost knocked him out.

96
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,540
Like he knocked him out.

97
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,560
It was out.

98
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,393
If it wasn't.

99
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,500
I mean he definitely did 10.

100
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,090
He was definitely down for 10.

101
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,140
But here's the thing.

102
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,130
If the referee,

103
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:20,120
instead of saying eight,

104
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:20,954
said seven,

105
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,390
instead of saying six had five
would have gotten up quicker.

106
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,750
I think he probably would have
because he's waiting for eight,

107
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,390
nine and then he's standing up
because he's trying to give himself.

108
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,180
He's an old vet.

109
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,960
He's trying to give himself as
much recovery time as he can.

110
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,850
I don't know what I watched
when I watched them getting up.

111
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:36,980
I look at that replay
and you see his head,

112
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,720
his head comes up like he's trying to
get up and then he just stands up like a

113
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:42,171
Zombie.

114
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:43,910
I think that's an gypsy shit.

115
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,163
It's scary.

116
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,690
Well,

117
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,370
I did not expect him to get up.

118
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,140
Um,

119
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,580
I would celebrate fight.

120
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,040
That doesn't mind.

121
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,440
While they were celebrating,

122
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,000
do the.

123
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,460
Was like when he went down,

124
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:00,760
I went,

125
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,511
oh shit,

126
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:04,750
I can't believe he knocked him
out in the twelfth like that.

127
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,670
And it was the left hook going down.

128
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:07,480
That was the craziest,

129
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,870
was on the right hand that
bang a left hook going down.

130
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:13,870
It was so insane and he walked off,

131
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:14,950
walk off.

132
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,340
It was a walk off knock out when he was
dancing and he was pointing to his woman

133
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,720
in the audience and she was saying,

134
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:20,381
I love you.

135
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:21,214
And he was like,

136
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,860
the whole thing was a celebratory moment.

137
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:27,250
And then the look on his face when he
realized that Tyson fury gotten up.

138
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:27,461
Like,

139
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,140
what?

140
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,973
Yeah,

141
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,291
you know,

142
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:29,960
you know what that is?

143
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,340
Remember,

144
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,780
remember the eighties and nineties,

145
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,131
the Friday,

146
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,240
the 13th movie when you killed
Jason and then you turn around.

147
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:36,491
It's like,

148
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:36,920
Oh shit.

149
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,550
That fries with a full setup.

150
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,450
That's what that was.

151
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,590
How does wilder punched so hard as a
man who studied martial arts his whole

152
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,230
life?

153
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,720
Like there's some dudes,

154
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,710
right?

155
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,100
Don't you think they have
some frequent explosive power,

156
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,770
but it's crazy how much he's getting.

157
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:53,441
He's only 200,

158
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,274
12 pounds.

159
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,540
That's the crazy thing.

160
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,610
It's like he's very
small for a heavyweight,

161
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,140
like a lot of these guys to 50.

162
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,500
Remember,

163
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,610
remember a guy named Mike Tyson?

164
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:00,911
Oh yeah.

165
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:02,410
He was still like in the two fifteens,

166
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:02,710
right?

167
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,680
He was like 2:15.

168
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,601
Yeah.

169
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,001
Not much.

170
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:05,834
Taking truck.

171
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,753
I don't,

172
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,560
I don't know how.

173
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,330
I mean I didn't have that kind of power,

174
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,070
my knockouts with from
like stuff you didn't see.

175
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,431
Yeah.

176
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:12,700
No,

177
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,391
and quickness.

178
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,650
But like a guy like Jeremy Stevens.

179
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,570
It's like that,

180
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:16,990
you know,

181
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,700
Melvin Guillard had that kind of power.

182
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,620
How do you develop?

183
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,640
I don't know if you could develop that.

184
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:22,810
I think that's a natural thing.

185
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,080
Yeah.

186
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,351
Rumble.

187
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:24,170
Johnson type house.

188
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:24,990
Yes.

189
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,440
Yes.

190
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:25,650
That's.

191
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,650
Think you can develop that.

192
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,670
I don't think so.

193
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,930
I think you can accentuate it.

194
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,930
I think we got hit hard with better
techniques and you hit harder.

195
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,910
I think it's a bone structure thing.

196
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,330
I mean it's like if you look at a Deontae,

197
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:40,280
he's kinda built like a
gigantic Tommy hearns.

198
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,800
Yeah.

199
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,530
You know,

200
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,530
just widen the shoulders and it's back
just a fucking bundle of muscle ups.

201
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,980
It's just like those,

202
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:49,160
uh,

203
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,790
those thick ass ropes that they use for,

204
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,870
for boats,

205
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,861
you know what I mean?

206
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,060
When they more ships,

207
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,740
that's like the muscles in his back,

208
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,330
just jack back.

209
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,800
That's where the power comes from.

210
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:03,460
I guess you should let him
body shot you fuck all that.

211
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,960
Fuck all that.

212
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:05,794
Dude.

213
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,750
That dude's a scary dude,

214
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,450
man.

215
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:08,690
Yeah.

216
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,440
He hits harder than anybody
I think in recent memory,

217
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,630
like his one shot power.

218
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,673
It's ridiculous.

219
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,461
What do you think?

220
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:20,740
I mean Tyson was a better boxer.

221
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,270
Pure boxer too.

222
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:22,900
So,

223
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,810
but like I would love to
see like big power punches,

224
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:26,170
like hey,

225
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,700
they need to make a
boxing game where they,

226
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,250
where they have all the guests.

227
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,101
They might have,

228
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:30,934
I don't know,

229
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,320
but they need to have one where they
have all the power punchers and power

230
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:36,210
puncher point of it.

231
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,233
Right.

232
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,451
Well,

233
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:37,781
you know what,

234
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,600
I feel like that's,

235
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,130
it was a perfect boxing match
because you haven't Tyson fury.

236
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,501
First of all,

237
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:48,790
you have this guy that overcame depression
and suicidal thoughts and you know,

238
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,320
drug addiction and alcoholism and me.

239
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,750
He was just obesity.

240
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:53,051
Yeah.

241
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:54,820
He was living in a world of depression,

242
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,780
he was just drinking constantly and doing
coke and fucking his life up and then

243
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,610
loses more than a hundred pounds.

244
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,810
Cleans himself up,

245
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,740
gets in there against the scariest guy
in the heavyweight division and puts on a

246
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,670
boxing clinic.

247
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,870
However,

248
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,640
he still gets clipped.

249
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,380
He still gets clipped not once,

250
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,540
but twice hard and dropped hard,

251
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,740
especially in the twelfth round.

252
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,250
So it's like for a person
who loves watching fights,

253
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,830
it's such a perfect
fight because you've got.

254
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,970
So first of all,

255
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,800
they're both great guys,

256
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,340
like,

257
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,290
like both guys like it.

258
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,700
If you're a fan of
exceptional human beings,

259
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,350
both guys are great guys.

260
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,040
Like the more I see Deontay
wilder interact with his family,

261
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,090
talk about things,

262
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:39,740
talk about the way he approaches fighting,

263
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,660
the more I appreciate what he's doing,

264
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,231
you know.

265
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,160
And then Tyson Fury,

266
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,031
how do you not love the guy?

267
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:48,470
And the way they exchanged pleasantries
after the fight was over and Tyson was

268
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:50,570
telling me he loved him and
he kissed his fucking fist.

269
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,403
I mean,

270
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,560
it was a great all around
a great feeling after,

271
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:55,490
even though it was a draw,

272
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,840
it was like I felt good about it.

273
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,740
That was rocky one.

274
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,910
It was rocky one.

275
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,610
That's what that list was rocky.

276
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,200
It was rocky one sort of.

277
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:03,680
Right.

278
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,700
But it wasn't a slugger.

279
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:05,534
That one,

280
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,260
you know,

281
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,320
mean what it was was just a great.

282
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,110
Nobody won.

283
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,190
Nobody one in first one.

284
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,053
Yeah.

285
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,113
It was a great,

286
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,370
great boxing match.

287
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,060
That's what it was.

288
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,301
Just like,

289
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:18,740
it had all the good elements.

290
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,350
It was the best heavyweight
fight I've seen in a long time.

291
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:22,430
I mean that,

292
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,780
that might've been better than,

293
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,280
than Holyfield Tyson.

294
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,950
That's hard to say because know
Holyfield was like the good guy coming in

295
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,480
against the bad guy.

296
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,220
Like there was so much to that fight.

297
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,120
And then with Tyson,

298
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,170
like you thought he was invincible and
then holy field just eating these shots

299
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:42,490
and slowly beaten them down
and then eventually stops them.

300
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:43,980
I Dunno.

301
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,750
I think it's ear bitten was bite now.

302
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:46,610
That was the second one.

303
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,570
Second fight.

304
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,403
Yeah.

305
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:48,831
Yeah.

306
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:49,191
That was,

307
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:50,024
uh,

308
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,601
it was,

309
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:50,990
uh,

310
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,651
it was one of the best.

311
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:52,401
I'll tell you what though,

312
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:52,760
man,

313
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,151
anthony,

314
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:56,870
Joshua versus Klitschko was one of
the best in a long time before that,

315
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,770
you know,

316
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:57,930
they,

317
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,470
they're gonna go that fella into a fight.

318
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,690
Someone's gonna,

319
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,500
someone's gonna trick
that fell into a fight.

320
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,490
I want to see those,

321
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:04,931
that,

322
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:06,290
that threeway mix,

323
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:06,980
you know?

324
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,251
Yeah.

325
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:09,560
I think Joshua better stay
the fuck away from wilder.

326
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,280
If I had,

327
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,720
if I was in his corner,

328
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,550
I was like,

329
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,900
going,

330
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,060
you get hit sometimes.

331
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,250
He don't want to get
it anytime by that guy.

332
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:16,850
Right.

333
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,120
He,

334
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,450
he's,

335
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:17,720
he's,

336
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,800
he's trying to avoid it.

337
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,410
I mean he's got his
head movement going now.

338
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,360
I know he's waking up

339
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,170
just fucking bobbing and weaving.

340
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,360
It's like the dudes like that.

341
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:31,730
The consequences of getting
clipped are so great.

342
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,720
It's so.

343
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,531
It's so interesting.

344
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:34,850
When someone has that kind of power,

345
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,390
the consequences are just so great.

346
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,800
They're different than anybody else
because you never stop watching.

347
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,100
You never stop watching
that fight with Tyson fury.

348
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,220
I mean we saw the gap
getting bigger in the points,

349
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,990
but then that knife round hit.

350
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,770
Yeah.

351
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,760
And he dropped him and he's like,

352
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:50,011
yeah,

353
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:53,060
see he could still do it and you'll watch
and watch and then the twelfth round

354
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:54,110
he hit him and then you know,

355
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:55,290
if your wildest fan like me,

356
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,320
you're jumping up and you,

357
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,600
you're celebrating your,

358
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:57,921
you know,

359
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:00,990
your victory and then
fucking Zombie gets out.

360
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,170
I'm so impressed.

361
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,370
Not only did he get up,

362
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,290
he won the remaining part of the round.

363
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,610
He stung wilder,

364
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,110
battled back off.

365
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,540
That can't.

366
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,830
Well I guess it could,

367
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,720
but it doesn't really happen in mma
where somebody just gets destroyed or,

368
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,490
or dominate I guess in MMA would be like
a bad beating in one round and then the

369
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:25,350
next round you'd come out
and you just like fresh.

370
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,990
Because when he dropped
him and when he get,

371
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,171
when,

372
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:29,490
when fury got up and he looked at him,

373
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:29,960
you know,

374
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
he was a little bit broken,

375
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:31,950
but he's probably like,

376
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,520
all right,

377
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:32,701
I'm gonna,

378
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,630
take this motherfucker out.

379
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,880
And then fury put it on him a little bit.

380
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,430
Probably not broke his spirit,

381
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:41,190
but it probably made him kind
of shrink up a little bit.

382
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,240
Well he got lit.

383
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:42,571
I mean,

384
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:43,590
he definitely got stung,

385
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,370
he got cracked and you'll see
him like his eyes rolled back.

386
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:48,780
He backed off a little bit and
then he grabbed a hold of Tyson.

387
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:49,021
I'm like,

388
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:49,501
whoa.

389
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:50,460
He got rocked.

390
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,540
Look,

391
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,030
both guys are incredible
good conditioning to.

392
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:54,271
For,

393
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:54,501
for,

394
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:54,801
for,

395
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:55,680
for heavyweights.

396
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:56,051
Immediate.

397
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:56,640
Yeah.

398
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,230
For to take shots that late and that.

399
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,870
That's a lot about conditioning.

400
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:01,681
When you get tired,

401
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:01,891
you,

402
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:02,191
you,

403
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:02,611
you know,

404
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:03,930
your brain is ready to shut off.

405
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,500
Yeah.

406
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,690
And to be that big,

407
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,340
I mean six foot nine,

408
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,940
256 pounds and still have
that kind of conditioning,

409
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,670
you know,

410
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,910
and wilder to carry that knockout power
in the twelfth after being frustrated

411
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,260
and just within a lot for fucking rounds.

412
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:21,180
That exhausts you,

413
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:21,811
the punches,

414
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:22,410
you miss those.

415
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,370
That takes so much off of.

416
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,990
You take so much.

417
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,680
Yeah.

418
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,400
Yeah.

419
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,770
It was just great all around.

420
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,710
It was just great.

421
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,543
What's the best?

422
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,460
What's the best boxing fight you can
remember watching in your lifetime life?

423
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:34,890
Not,

424
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,551
not in person,

425
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,110
but just watching it as it happens.

426
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:37,831
Wow.

427
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:38,970
That's a good question.

428
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,790
I think Julio Cesar Chavez
versus Meldrick Taylor,

429
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,680
a lot of people say that I didn't watch
that one line because Taylor was so

430
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:50,460
good.

431
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,460
He was so fast and he was winning up
until the twelfth round and Chavez just

432
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:57,510
kept the pressure,

433
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:58,530
kept the pressure,

434
00:10:58,531 --> 00:10:59,490
kept the pressure,

435
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:00,324
kept the pressure,

436
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,250
and then eventually crack crack.

437
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,600
He had some of the big right hand.

438
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:04,291
The twelfth round,

439
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,420
you see Meldrick has just beaten down.

440
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,850
The downside of that fight is Meldrick.

441
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:10,110
Taylor was never the same again.

442
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,620
Yeah.

443
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,200
That was one beating that just.

444
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,700
He crossed over beyond the Pale
and went to the dark lands.

445
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,250
It's just not good after that fight.

446
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,851
So what,

447
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:21,180
what do you think if a.

448
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,420
was it Richard Steele was rough.

449
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,240
I think it was.

450
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,240
So steel doesn't start that fight in those
last seconds and Meldrick Taylor wins

451
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,490
on the cards then.

452
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,260
Then what happens is their rematch
and does he look the same as he?

453
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,120
Was He the same guy after that?

454
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,880
I think if he wins the match,

455
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,670
he's done.

456
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,020
He's done no matter what.

457
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,430
Remember when Terry talked about after
that he just did not look like he could

458
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:48,450
take a punch anymore.

459
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,400
That fight was so brutal.

460
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,350
If you watch that fight against Chavez,

461
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:54,070
just raking his

462
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,150
body and clip them,

463
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,480
but meldrick was just
so fast and so skillful,

464
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,460
like his movement and his speed,

465
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,160
but Chavez was just relentless,

466
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,600
was a great fight.

467
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,530
Elizah great fight,

468
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,940
but watched it after the fact.

469
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,230
But there's a few of those fights where
you know that that was the one where the

470
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,480
guy's never going to be the same again.

471
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,343
Yeah.

472
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,051
You,

473
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:14,321
you,

474
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:15,880
you felt that way watching it?

475
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,240
No,

476
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,380
I felt that way afterwards.

477
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,550
I mean watching it,

478
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:18,880
you go,

479
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,713
what a great fight,

480
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,900
but then afterwards you realize like,

481
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,241
oh,

482
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,074
that was it.

483
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,920
That was the fight.

484
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,320
I kind of felt that way honestly for MMA.

485
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:31,321
I felt that way about rory after the
Roy Robbie fight who wonderboy and I was

486
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:32,561
like,

487
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:32,681
yeah,

488
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:33,550
he doesn't look the same.

489
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,390
Well,

490
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,850
I think he was having real
problems with his nose.

491
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,933
You know,

492
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,950
his nose has been shattered a bunch of
times and he just can't take a shot at it

493
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:42,640
anymore.

494
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,230
It just starts bleeding really bad,

495
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,880
but I think physically the way he moves
and his ability to take punches is still

496
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:49,720
exactly the same.

497
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,770
Like you saw him in the Lima file.

498
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,440
It looks good still.

499
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:53,651
Yeah,

500
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:54,280
he does.

501
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,240
He fucked up taking them.

502
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,260
We saucy fight though.

503
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah,

504
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,810
that's us too big to too big.

505
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,280
I thought the same thing to,

506
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,790
you know.

507
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,361
Exactly.

508
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:05,860
I mean they have a lot of similar sales
skill sets and then the bigger guy,

509
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,300
it's like what's the saucy?

510
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:09,280
Might be a little better to striking.

511
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,670
Definitely better with
a striking his grounds.

512
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:13,510
No joke either.

513
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,350
Yeah.

514
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,700
Massage is just so good,

515
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:16,030
man.

516
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,770
He's so good that like if I
was in his corner of billet,

517
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,060
look,

518
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,661
I get that.

519
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:20,520
You want to do a superfight?

520
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,610
I want to do a challenge.

521
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,430
These guys quite a bit
bigger than you and really,

522
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,750
really fucking good.

523
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:26,660
Like when you started,

524
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,493
you might be the best one.

525
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,930
80 five are in the world.

526
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,220
Thinks that he's not.

527
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,241
If he's not easy,

528
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:31,931
he's there.

529
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:32,800
He's with whitaker,

530
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:33,730
he's with Joelle.

531
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,623
He's there.

532
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:34,910
I,

533
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,150
I.

534
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,190
There's a mix of them.

535
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:36,881
I really,

536
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:37,720
really like.

537
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:41,020
I have a whole lot of confidence
in whitaker to quietly.

538
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,350
He just kind of rose up to the top
and I think people still sleep on him.

539
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,340
I think so too,

540
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,370
but I got to say that I was surprised
at the decision in the Yoel Romero fight

541
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:51,800
the second one.

542
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,211
Yeah,

543
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:52,450
I,

544
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,160
I think Romero won that fight.

545
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:54,580
Yeah.

546
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,840
Or if not one it.

547
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,950
It was so close.

548
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:57,880
It had to be a draw.

549
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,620
It was so fucking close.

550
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,930
But I think Romero did
way more damage Ramiro.

551
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,530
See?

552
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,330
He heard him a couple times.

553
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,040
Think about like the wild or fight.

554
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:06,950
Like someone said to me like,

555
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,241
oh,

556
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:08,770
the score cards are all fucked up.

557
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,790
Tyson fury should have one.

558
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,291
Maybe.

559
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:11,860
Yes.

560
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,191
Maybe.

561
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:14,800
I see what you're saying if you're
looking at it in terms of like that.

562
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:17,800
But as a person who knows what a fight is,

563
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,800
wilder clearly won the fight.

564
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,090
If it was a fight.

565
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:22,780
Right?

566
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,650
Who's getting fucked up right in the
school yard where the one that he won.

567
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,131
Right.

568
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:29,140
And this is the Yoel
Romero whittaker thing.

569
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:29,980
Who won the fight?

570
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,450
Whitaker's getting,

571
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,020
you know,

572
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,170
just he got hit with bombs by Joelle.

573
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,490
Joelle hit him with some fucking
haymakers and whitaker survive,

574
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,720
but when it could never put you well in
that same sort of situation where you're

575
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:45,340
well with staggering around
like really badly hurt me.

576
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,080
You Whitaker is a champ.

577
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,573
I mean the,

578
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:48,970
the,

579
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,960
the skills,

580
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,681
the heart,

581
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,291
the courage,

582
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,124
all those things.

583
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,150
I mean he's got everything.

584
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:54,050
He's a champ,

585
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,380
but I felt like the damage done.

586
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,870
I hate the 10 point muscles.

587
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,750
Yes.

588
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,040
I hate it.

589
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,270
I mean so stupid.

590
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,213
It doesn't make any sense.

591
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,510
A five minute rounds
you'll using 10 points.

592
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,110
Why?

593
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,160
Because it was already there.

594
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,241
Exactly.

595
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:08,481
That's,

596
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:11,780
that's the big thing for me because
I mean we got aspects of Jujitsu,

597
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,800
got aspects of wrestling.

598
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:15,320
We've got aspects of striking
boxing and kickboxing.

599
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,070
Right?

600
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,070
And we're using a rule set from
boxing only one set of weapons.

601
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,140
That's it.

602
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,600
And like how does that,

603
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,570
how does that quantify the takedowns
and the grappling exchanges?

604
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:27,404
It's right.

605
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,010
It's,

606
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,843
I dunno,

607
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,250
I,

608
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,060
I disagree.

609
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,310
I remember there were,

610
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:34,550
they had all these different systems they
were trying to work and I feel like at

611
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:38,390
one point I think doc rivers maybe
had Campbellton thought Hamilton.

612
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:38,661
Sorry.

613
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:38,801
Yeah,

614
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:39,940
he does basketball,

615
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:41,880
but yeah,

616
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,580
doc Hamilton has an excellent system.

617
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,250
Was that half point system right?

618
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,060
Which was better,

619
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,950
was better than what we're using now.

620
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,270
The pride system was better.

621
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:50,631
Yeah.

622
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:51,580
The system is better.

623
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,500
Chose to fight as a whole and the last
part of the fight is more important than

624
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,334
the first Friday of the fight.

625
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,850
Right?

626
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,340
Because that kind of tells you the
path that we're going on a school yard,

627
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:58,730
right?

628
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,480
Who's on top?

629
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,380
Who's on top of the teachers get
there was beating the dude down.

630
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:02,991
The teachers get there.

631
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:06,860
Nobody cares if you like throw a leg
kicks and boxing the guy up for 15 minutes

632
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,920
and then the teachers come right when
the guy gets on top of you and punching

633
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:10,281
your face.

634
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:11,270
And I want the decision.

635
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:11,960
No,

636
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,071
no,

637
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:12,221
no,

638
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:12,380
no,

639
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,591
no.

640
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:15,880
The teachers pull that guy off
you and then you get rebounds.

641
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,660
Rematches in school.

642
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,580
Fucking hard to swallow.

643
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,620
You gotta you gotTa have balls,

644
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,710
so that rematch in school.

645
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,080
Yeah.

646
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,363
No money.

647
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:28,923
All Glory.

648
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,020
No,

649
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,850
this has got to be right.

650
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,060
There's got to be a
rematch for this fight.

651
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,980
It's going to be the biggest
heavyweight fighter of all time.

652
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,521
I mean,

653
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:39,300
there's going to be Gi fucking antic
and I'm happy for wilder because while

654
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,430
there is finally a star,

655
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,470
I mean forever.

656
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,270
We wanted an American
heavyweight champion.

657
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,133
Yup.

658
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,310
Klitschko had it forever.

659
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,590
Now we have not only an
American heavyweight champion,

660
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,670
but we had an American every week,

661
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:50,490
championed the knocks.

662
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,250
Everybody the fuck out,

663
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,690
knocks everybody the fuck out.

664
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:54,530
Super exciting.

665
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,543
Great Guy.

666
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,560
For some reason he didn't catch like.

667
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,200
It's weird like who
catches who gets famous?

668
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,130
It's weird.

669
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,940
But then when you look at the post
fight interviews and I'm Tyson Fury,

670
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:05,720
you know,

671
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,471
God bless me.

672
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:08,120
God bless you and God bless America.

673
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:09,760
I mean he got a lot of people on his side.

674
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,670
He's not American.

675
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,750
He's a good guy.

676
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,190
I him in here.

677
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,230
He's great.

678
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,420
I mean,

679
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,320
he's a real character.

680
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,303
He's the real deal.

681
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,121
Both of them are.

682
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:17,331
I mean,

683
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:20,930
I'm fucking so excited about the
rematch when you think that happens.

684
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:21,890
It's got to be a long time.

685
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:23,230
He got hit with some bombs.

686
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,670
If I was in Tyson's camp up,

687
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:24,861
like,

688
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:29,840
do we got to take some time off so I know
you feel great and you're riding this

689
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:30,290
high.

690
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,390
How about the guy donates
all his money to charity?

691
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,651
Isn't that incredible?

692
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:35,390
That's just ridiculously incredible.

693
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,950
$10,000,000.

694
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,010
$10,000,000 just donated.

695
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,190
Is he going to do that in the rematch?

696
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,620
Rematch is $100,000,000

697
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,453
deficit.

698
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,360
Floyd mayweather money,

699
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:47,880
right?

700
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,670
The rematch could be the biggest
heavyweight title fight ever.

701
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,533
Yeah.

702
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:52,170
Yeah.

703
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:52,351
It's,

704
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:52,681
I mean,

705
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:54,690
it's bigger than right now,

706
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,710
especially with the world,

707
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,441
the way the world is.

708
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,110
It's bigger than totally feel Tyson.

709
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,380
It's bigger than you.

710
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,700
It's bigger than Holyfield
Tyson and think or right there,

711
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,020
at least right there.

712
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,680
It's hard to say because Tyson
was such a cultural phenomenon,

713
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,370
like there was no one like him when
we're kids and when Tyson would fight,

714
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,390
it would just be like,

715
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:12,571
uh,

716
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:16,140
watching a public executions
and people would wonder,

717
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:17,130
should I pay for this?

718
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,530
Should I get this pay per view?

719
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,010
How long is it going to last?

720
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,670
Have a bunch of people over popcorn
and shit and it lasts 15 seconds.

721
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,251
What,

722
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:24,990
what do you think?

723
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,990
What do you think the benefit of while
they're having Tyson come into his next

724
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:31,110
camp?

725
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,300
Is Tyson him and he's a student now.

726
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,520
He knows boxing well.

727
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,503
Is he doing that?

728
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,583
I don't know.

729
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,150
But what would the benefit be?

730
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,830
Looked at the benefit would be great.

731
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,830
Mark Tyson knows a lot about boxing.

732
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,240
I mean he doesn't just know a lot
about how he boxed the history,

733
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,751
but he,

734
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:48,870
uh,

735
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,040
he knows so much.

736
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,740
I mean that was like
one of the big things.

737
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:53,010
Uh,

738
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:58,010
one of the big stories about his childhood
was him watching Jim Jacobs old reel

739
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:01,700
to reel films that wash up.

740
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,380
He'd watch all those old school films.

741
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:06,780
Joe Lewis and Shit and Jack Dempsey,

742
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,290
you know,

743
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:07,560
he,

744
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,100
he liked pattern a lot of his style
after watching those old timers.

745
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,940
Archie Moore and yeah,

746
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,621
I mean I think,

747
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:14,070
uh,

748
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,930
he could definitely help them I think.

749
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:20,510
But the style of someone
who could help wilder would,

750
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,560
would be someone who is
going to incorporate more
movement and and more like

751
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,403
switch up.

752
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,190
Like don't always throw a bomb.

753
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,160
You know who I would bring in files,

754
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:32,994
wilder,

755
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,893
Andre Ward,

756
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,090
Andre Ward and Virgil Hill.

757
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,700
Have those guys tighten up what he does.

758
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,930
I think Andre Ward is one of
the smartest guys in boxing.

759
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,380
How,

760
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,290
how is he as a,

761
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,071
as an instructor,

762
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:44,850
as a teacher?

763
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,890
He's too fucking smart
to not be good at it.

764
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,180
He's too smart.

765
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,620
He knows too much about boxing.

766
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,950
Like he's one of my favorite
analysts when he talks about fights,

767
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,660
like the way he breaks things down.

768
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,080
Yes.

769
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,441
You know,

770
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:55,661
and,

771
00:19:55,661 --> 00:20:00,120
and he's a guy who really does
find weaknesses and exploit them.

772
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:04,180
It's not just pushing buttons and
throwing haymakers like if you look at his

773
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,400
rematch with Cova level,

774
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:06,870
like he figured that fucking guy out.

775
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,651
Like he,

776
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:10,290
he got hurt by him early
in the first fight,

777
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,570
but then one the remainder of the fight.

778
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,200
And then one of the decision a little
bit controversial but then said,

779
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,530
I know how to beat this motherfucker.

780
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:18,260
And then came back and the
second fight and stopped him.

781
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,133
Yeah.

782
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:19,561
Yeah.

783
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:22,050
Andre Ward is and Virgil Hill.

784
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,153
That's old school.

785
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,990
Old School.

786
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,600
Yeah.

787
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:24,990
That's,

788
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,280
that would be a good fit.

789
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,230
But there's a lot of good fits in boxing.

790
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Boxing is an interesting thing is that
they've had this long history of trial

791
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:36,040
and error that,

792
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,160
that MMA hasn't had,

793
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:38,851
you know,

794
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:39,780
like you see,

795
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,010
you see this,

796
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,640
you know,

797
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,490
you got lineage that goes back
to the sixties and seventies.

798
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:46,620
And I'm like,

799
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,470
yeah,

800
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,050
goes back

801
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,883
way.

802
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,520
Yeah.

803
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,540
I really pap.

804
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,430
Sure.

805
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,770
I mean in terms of like active trainers.

806
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,680
Oh yes.

807
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,970
And active gems,

808
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:56,620
you know,

809
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,960
I mean these guys had
been around for forever.

810
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,140
They've been putting champions into rings
for decades and there's a lot of those

811
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,014
guys out there.

812
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,681
I think about.

813
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,600
I think about that too
with like with Tyson.

814
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,330
I mean like if customer
auto didn't die when he did,

815
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,120
would tyson's career have been different?

816
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,790
Probably would have that.

817
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,180
It probably would have been different.

818
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:16,391
I mean,

819
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:19,300
I think Kevin Rooney did his best
to try to keep that teaching going.

820
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,141
But,

821
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:20,650
uh,

822
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,210
I think sometimes that mentor is
the glue that keeps you together.

823
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:25,600
Yeah,

824
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,780
that's what I'm talking about.

825
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:26,990
Yeah.

826
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,910
The other stuff,

827
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,230
that guy meant so much to Tyson because
custom model essentially gave him this

828
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,400
new lease on life.

829
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,250
He thought he was going to be a loser
and his life is going to be hell.

830
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,370
And then instead he's the
heavyweight champion of the world,

831
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:40,270
the youngest ever,

832
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,583
you know.

833
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,010
But then,

834
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,680
yeah.

835
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:43,930
Well,

836
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:44,650
you know,

837
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,300
Teddy Atlas had a very,

838
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:47,950
very interesting take on Tyson.

839
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,980
He just felt like Tyson never developed
the skills to overcome adversity.

840
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,840
So as long as he was dominating
everyone who was great,

841
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,700
but as soon as it started
coming back and him,

842
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:57,940
he would,

843
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,320
he would never recover from that.

844
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,591
You know,

845
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:03,520
we call that Nima me the
bully or a front runner.

846
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,433
Yeah.

847
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:04,660
Yeah.

848
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,710
There's a lot of guys like that,

849
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:06,030
right?

850
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,470
Yeah.

851
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,303
And good on top.

852
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,260
Yes.

853
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,681
They're good.

854
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:09,220
Hammer.

855
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,180
Not such a good nail.

856
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,230
Yeah.

857
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,640
You got to be able to take them both.

858
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,743
Yeah.

859
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,380
You,

860
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,600
when you say hammer and nail
every reminds me of like,

861
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,970
there was something I was thinking when
we're talking about rory and Robbie,

862
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,230
like would,

863
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:24,640
it takes how much pain you
have to be in to be a fighter,

864
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:28,570
to be a fun of Roy's caliber and
then just sit down and concede.

865
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,250
Yeah.

866
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,030
Because like it hurts that much.

867
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,130
I think his face was shattered.

868
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,760
His nose was broken into eight or
nine pieces or some shit like that.

869
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:37,240
It was just,

870
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,740
it was just mush and I just don't think
he physically could go on anymore.

871
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,461
Like I've had.

872
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:42,970
I've had,

873
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,050
I've had breaks in training,

874
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,370
either breaks in and fights.

875
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:45,910
Um,

876
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,160
broke my jaw one's training.

877
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:47,440
I was like,

878
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:47,591
oh,

879
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:48,150
that hurts.

880
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:48,660
Uh,

881
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,331
and then I got hit again.

882
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:49,571
It's like,

883
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:49,661
yeah,

884
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:50,494
I can't do this.

885
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,493
Then I'm just.

886
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,200
Was it a clean snap?

887
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:53,461
No,

888
00:22:53,461 --> 00:22:54,130
it's just a,

889
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,150
a hairline.

890
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,051
But like,

891
00:22:56,051 --> 00:22:56,590
it hurt,

892
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,910
like I couldn't chew.

893
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,410
I was crying the next day.

894
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,510
I didn't know is broken
until the next day.

895
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,590
But um,

896
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,920
and then when I fly out,

897
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,950
Ludwig and bang,

898
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,130
and I thought I was on top,

899
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:06,761
he was on his back.

900
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:07,900
He feels a punch upwards,

901
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:12,100
hits me right in the
eyeball and bust my orbital.

902
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:12,491
Yeah.

903
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,080
You're talking about this
the last time you were here?

904
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,470
Yeah,

905
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,270
it's crazy when he hit me though,

906
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,313
I was like,

907
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,280
that hurts.

908
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,491
Oh,

909
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:20,080
I put my head down for
a second and I was like,

910
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,340
I got to tap this guy at a tap,

911
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:21,611
this guy.

912
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:26,050
So I'm just trying to institute
a Jujitsu game and um,

913
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,490
he's escaping all the time.

914
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,540
But the pain,

915
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:28,991
it was like,

916
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:33,790
it wasn't like I went out for Laurie
to sit down and concede like I can only

917
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:37,450
imagine because I've been in pain and
a fight like excruciating pain is like,

918
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:39,340
I just got to figure this out and move on.

919
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,421
But he was just like,

920
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:40,631
no,

921
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:41,464
that's enough.

922
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,270
And it's rory.

923
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:44,290
We know how tough he is.

924
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,620
He's also crazy.

925
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,161
Like,

926
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:47,090
this is a dude who he,

927
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:47,571
you know,

928
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:48,404
he's like,

929
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,600
you just kind of expect him to have bodies

930
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,013
bodies on it.

931
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,820
Did you see him when he was on a podcast?

932
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,361
No,

933
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:56,830
I didn't.

934
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,620
I didn't see that.

935
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,240
He's not like you would think he is.

936
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,270
He's a great guy.

937
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:00,640
He is.

938
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,311
He's like very,

939
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:03,260
like warm and friendly is awesome.

940
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:03,950
I sat on it,

941
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,160
sat with sat next to him on the bus a
bunch of different times and we were just

942
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:07,994
writing to their arena.

943
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,340
We've had a bunch of conversations.

944
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,861
I love him,

945
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:10,694
but when you see his,

946
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,450
his demeanor or his persona when he,

947
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:13,920
when he's,

948
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,420
you know,

949
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,350
in front of the camera,

950
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,060
he just seems very

951
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,540
serious,

952
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,320
very serious.

953
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,700
And that killer,

954
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:24,230
like serial killer.

955
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,393
He is.

956
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,510
He's not done either.

957
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,090
I mean I think the fight was a bad idea,

958
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,300
but I still think he's one of the best
welterweights on the planet and 100

959
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,260
percent,

960
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:33,740
100 years.

961
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,573
I mean he can come,

962
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,990
he can come back to the UFC and.

963
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,430
And threatened tyron.

964
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,780
I think so.

965
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,510
I mean he,

966
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,730
he beat tired when the first time,

967
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:41,511
but that's a different.

968
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:42,110
Tyron,

969
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,530
tyron with Duke Roufus is a
different time and I think,

970
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:46,400
you know,

971
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,090
he's just,

972
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,380
he knows more now.

973
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,610
He's a champion now.

974
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,240
He successfully defended his title
several times and he's much better too.

975
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,133
He's um,

976
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,860
he's still slows later in the fight,

977
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,790
but like,

978
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,890
it's drastically different
than it used to be.

979
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,043
Um,

980
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,210
and once what I would like to see out of
Tyron is more use of all of his skills

981
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:13,211
later on and not just looking at land
that big right hand because like tyron can

982
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:14,174
do everything,

983
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,680
tyron can do everything,

984
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,490
but there are those times when you see
him start to really depend on that right

985
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:20,600
hand and only look for that.

986
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:21,501
And he's like,

987
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:22,760
he's like right hand,

988
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,743
right hand,

989
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:24,711
right hand,

990
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:25,191
right hand,

991
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:25,670
right hand.

992
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,340
The thing about that right
hand though is it works

993
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,330
when you have something like wilders,

994
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,000
right hand or leg tyrants,

995
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,610
white hand,

996
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,330
you have something that can you have a
right hand that could put anybody out.

997
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,111
I mean this is,

998
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:40,340
I brought up before,

999
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:41,120
but think about it.

1000
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,970
He fought Darren till and
they fought wonderboy twice.

1001
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:44,990
Those are two,

1002
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,770
two guys that are arguably the best
strikers in the 170 pound division.

1003
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,341
Fuck.

1004
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:50,630
Both of them up on their feet.

1005
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,490
I mean both fights.

1006
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,300
Wonderboy was on Queer Street
and then in the till fight,

1007
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,220
the only punch landed at all was by Tyron.

1008
00:25:59,221 --> 00:25:59,420
Right.

1009
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,000
He cracks till drops until Neverland
touched him with a glove drop.

1010
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:05,300
Some beats the shit out of
him and then chokes him.

1011
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,540
I think that was one of the
best performances from tyron.

1012
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:08,820
I.

1013
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,520
He looked really good in that fight.

1014
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,200
Really.

1015
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,870
He looked almost like
a disdainful to like,

1016
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:15,110
you know,

1017
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,800
you motherfuckers can't believe you
guys got him the Fed betting favorite?

1018
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,131
Yes.

1019
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:19,581
Like what?

1020
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:21,520
What is that shit going to beats.

1021
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,520
Cowboy cerrone.

1022
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,590
A guy was supposed to be
fighting at 155 pounds.

1023
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:28,220
He's tough as shit but one big fight
and all of a sudden you guys have in the

1024
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:29,060
betting favorite.

1025
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,290
This is preposterous.

1026
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,490
Put some respect on my name.

1027
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,180
Yeah,

1028
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,590
well he's a,

1029
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,010
he's a polarizing figure for some reason.

1030
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,933
I don't know why.

1031
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,990
Maybe it's one of those things
where guys have to catch,

1032
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,460
you know,

1033
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,430
like maybe it's like if tyron

1034
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,900
had a GSP fight,

1035
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,450
like if GSP comes out
of retirement fights,

1036
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:48,841
tyron,

1037
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,310
tyron smashes GSP,

1038
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,930
then maybe people go,

1039
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,640
I wonder like what Mohammed
Ali was like because I wasn't,

1040
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,950
I wasn't there like
everybody loves him now,

1041
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,690
but did they love him when he was,

1042
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:02,310
when he was running his mouth?

1043
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:02,720
And like,

1044
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,930
I'm sure people did.

1045
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,530
I'm sure that he had um,

1046
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,220
his,

1047
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:06,420
you know,

1048
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,091
like the economy,

1049
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:07,924
greg of fans,

1050
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,491
you know,

1051
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:10,170
because he was that good.

1052
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,250
But I wonder if there was this big
contingent of people that were like,

1053
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,060
yeah,

1054
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,893
no,

1055
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,760
we hate that Muhammad Ali guy.

1056
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,241
Well,

1057
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:20,220
he was really that good,

1058
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,180
but then he wasn't.

1059
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,570
See what happened was we got really crazy
with our was they made him take three

1060
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:30,210
years right off of fighting and during
that three years he was supposed to be

1061
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,070
fighting in Vietnam.

1062
00:27:31,071 --> 00:27:31,321
He's like,

1063
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:32,131
fuck you,

1064
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:33,070
I'm not going to Vietnam.

1065
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,280
So they stripped him of his
title and then he doesn't train.

1066
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:35,941
I mean,

1067
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:36,930
when he came back,

1068
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:37,910
did you ever see his comeback?

1069
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,220
Find,

1070
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,970
nope,

1071
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,500
he came back against Jerry Quarry and I'm,

1072
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,710
I'm telling you man,

1073
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,570
he looked like he had no muscle.

1074
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,390
Like you look at him from the old days,

1075
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:48,811
like look,

1076
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:49,770
when he fought Cleveland,

1077
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:50,760
big Cat Williams.

1078
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,250
I mean he was just a Greek God,

1079
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,570
but then you see him when he's coming
back and he's fighting quarry three years

1080
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:58,110
out of the ring,

1081
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,550
probably barely trained at all.

1082
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,730
His body just looks slower and smoother.

1083
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,110
He just didn't look the same.

1084
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,880
Like physically see if
you could find that.

1085
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,061
I mean,

1086
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,500
and Jerry quarry was
just a super tough guy.

1087
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:12,870
Just would walk forward
and eat a bunch of shots.

1088
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,010
But you look,

1089
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,530
you look at his body like
it doesn't look the same.

1090
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:16,831
See,

1091
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:17,071
look it,

1092
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:17,910
look at his back.

1093
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,120
He doesn't mean he obviously
went through a full camp.

1094
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,133
Get ready for that,

1095
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,810
but he doesn't look like
the Muhammad Ali of old.

1096
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:27,270
And then when he's
fighting he doesn't move.

1097
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:28,710
Like the Muhammad Ali of old.

1098
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,540
Those three years took a toll on them.

1099
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:31,410
Like look at his body.

1100
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,640
Just doesn't look the same.

1101
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,043
Yeah.

1102
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,530
Yeah.

1103
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,790
He looks a little smaller.

1104
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,270
Yeah.

1105
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,890
Smaller because he hasn't been training,

1106
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,540
so we lost,

1107
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,010
probably lost a lot of muscle,

1108
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:46,011
just looks smoother and just doesn't look
as quick or as good and he's fighting

1109
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:48,090
a guy that has no business
in the ring with him,

1110
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,553
you know,

1111
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,830
he's fighting a guy that mean and he's
a jerry quarry is a sad story when it

1112
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,700
comes to brain damage to
like the end of his career,

1113
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,040
the end of his life rather.

1114
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,360
It was horrible.

1115
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,840
I mean he had fought so many times against
big punchers and was known for being

1116
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:07,710
able to take a punch.

1117
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,500
And then also I think coming up,

1118
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:11,790
I think it was his brothers,

1119
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,330
his brother also had like a
real problem with brain damage.

1120
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,440
I think they did a lot of
real hard sparring together
and a lot of hard sparring

1121
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:22,320
and the gym and the end
of his life was awful.

1122
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:26,700
I read an article about what it was like
at the end for him and it was similar

1123
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:28,590
to what the end was like for Ali.

1124
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:29,421
It's,

1125
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:30,254
um,

1126
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,130
I dunno,

1127
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,963
I always,

1128
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,130
when someone says something,

1129
00:29:33,131 --> 00:29:34,290
it makes me think of something else.

1130
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:38,740
And you're talking about cory and his
brother made me think of Joe Lozan and Dan

1131
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,690
Lowe's on fighting in the yard when
they would have those barbecues.

1132
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,840
Beat the shit out of each other.

1133
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,771
Like legit.

1134
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:46,300
Beat the fuck out of each other.

1135
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:47,290
Yeah.

1136
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,030
I don't know if I could
do that to my family.

1137
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,790
They had a different kind of friendship.

1138
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,630
It's so funny.

1139
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,620
It's crazy.

1140
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:56,860
Those videos of Joe on top of him
punching him in the head from behind.

1141
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:57,101
I'm like,

1142
00:29:57,101 --> 00:29:58,140
whoa.

1143
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,350
Joe Dot.

1144
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,950
Yeah,

1145
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,431
exactly.

1146
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:01,270
That's what I'm thinking.

1147
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:01,840
It's like,

1148
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,800
that's not a stranger.

1149
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,090
Well,

1150
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:04,391
you know,

1151
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:07,750
that's some of the toughest guys grew
up with brothers and they already here

1152
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,370
beating the shit out of each other.

1153
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,810
This is what I stick it out.

1154
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,471
The thing is though,

1155
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:12,640
this is Massachusetts.

1156
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Massachusetts is a fucking hard ass
place in there fighting mean they're full

1157
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:24,661
blast kicks and punches and then the
entire family is watching now and they're,

1158
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,130
they're having a real legit mma fight.

1159
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,080
I mean,

1160
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,501
look at that.

1161
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:30,970
That's what a bunch of psychos.

1162
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:35,500
They got little girls watching and shit
in there on the grass and he's beating

1163
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,730
the shit out of his brother

1164
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,680
and he's better to look at what
kind of cycle family or the

1165
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,360
fucking car,

1166
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,950
the whole family sitting there.

1167
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,820
Oh Shit.

1168
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,100
They put a soundtrack on it.

1169
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,280
Oh,

1170
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,061
that's hilarious.

1171
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:55,894
Awesome.

1172
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:56,651
Yeah,

1173
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:57,401
let's not watch this.

1174
00:30:57,401 --> 00:31:00,340
I like both these guys
got them at triangle.

1175
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:00,980
Oh,

1176
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,100
I'm about tyron though.

1177
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:03,770
Like I,

1178
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,340
I don't.

1179
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:04,840
I mean,

1180
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,380
look when,

1181
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,580
when Ali was,

1182
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:07,150
uh,

1183
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,690
the whole thing about him
refusing to fight in the draft,

1184
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:12,100
like people hated him.

1185
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,720
There was a lot of people that hated him.

1186
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:17,020
A lot of people that consider themselves
patriots and thought it was before.

1187
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:20,170
We have to realize that now pretty much
everybody thinks the Vietnam war was a

1188
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:20,980
terrible idea.

1189
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,520
Right?

1190
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,870
The Gulf of Tonkin incident,

1191
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,470
which got everybody into
Vietnam was a false flag.

1192
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:27,340
It was all bullshit.

1193
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,960
We shouldn't have been
there in the first place.

1194
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,140
Who knows what the real reason
for being in Vietnam was.

1195
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:35,610
But a lot of people think that had to do
with heroin and money and all kinds of

1196
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,190
crazy shit.

1197
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:36,700
Right?

1198
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,200
So when Ali said,

1199
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,330
I'm not fighting that
war back then though,

1200
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,310
back then people thought he was a coward.

1201
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:42,700
Right?

1202
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,210
Back then people thought he was a trader
and he was aligned with Malcolm x.

1203
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:49,240
He changed his name from Cassius clay to
Muhammad Ali and everybody was worried

1204
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,740
about the black panthers and
the black Muslims and you know,

1205
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,121
it was like,

1206
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:54,220
there was a lot of hate
towards him I'm sure.

1207
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,550
And so then when he came back and
he was not the same guy anymore,

1208
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:58,630
I'm sure people loved it.

1209
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,493
They were happy.

1210
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,390
They were happy when Joe Frazier beat him,

1211
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,253
people were happy.

1212
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,100
Yeah.

1213
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,933
Yeah.

1214
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,210
That's,

1215
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,200
that's human nature.

1216
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,760
It is.

1217
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,880
People pick sides.

1218
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,220
Like you picked sides when
wildin knockdown fury.

1219
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,060
Yeah.

1220
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,751
We pick sides.

1221
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:14,011
I don't.

1222
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:15,250
You mean you don't know those guys,

1223
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:15,600
right?

1224
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,330
No,

1225
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:16,750
like,

1226
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,970
I'm also not going to hate on it,

1227
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:19,020
but you know what I mean,

1228
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,601
that's the thing.

1229
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:20,680
I'm not hating on theory.

1230
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:21,460
I was like,

1231
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,130
fuck you.

1232
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,900
You know,

1233
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,240
we're also a successful
professional fighter.

1234
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:26,680
You're not just a regular hater.

1235
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:27,851
He just said,

1236
00:32:27,851 --> 00:32:28,121
dude,

1237
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:29,030
why am I special?

1238
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,943
Kind of

1239
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,810
successful former fighter,

1240
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:39,010
fought many different organizations
like for you to be rooting on somebody.

1241
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,130
It feels different

1242
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:40,401
to me.

1243
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:41,234
It's okay.

1244
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,550
I'm glad I got the stamp of approval
if he just doesn't feel I get it.

1245
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:47,390
You like the style.

1246
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:47,720
I mean,

1247
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,880
who doesn't like knock out?

1248
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,960
Who the fuck doesn't like knockouts?

1249
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,003
Everybody loves it.

1250
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,993
I love him man.

1251
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,590
Like Jeremy Stevens.

1252
00:32:55,591 --> 00:32:57,290
This is the guy that
I love to watch fight,

1253
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,183
right?

1254
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,050
Like when I was fighting him.

1255
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,310
That's a different story.

1256
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:02,930
But like watching him fight.

1257
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:03,291
Yes.

1258
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:04,760
I want to see that every time.

1259
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,260
But then when I'm fighting him,

1260
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:07,370
I want you to root for me.

1261
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,850
He had a terrifying style.

1262
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,470
Still has a terrifying style.

1263
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,760
He's just do or die.

1264
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,960
If Jeremy connects,

1265
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,800
you go over,

1266
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,730
you can be Foxville and he carries
that power deep deep into a fight.

1267
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:20,620
No,

1268
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,340
I remember when he was
young and he fought rda.

1269
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:23,443
Yes.

1270
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:23,990
Yeah.

1271
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,820
That upper cut and that was a.

1272
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:26,960
That was a highlight reel.

1273
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,190
Upper cut for a long time.

1274
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,000
Mom fight.

1275
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,330
Rda Guzman.

1276
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,670
I saw the end of it to the last round.

1277
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,180
Who sponsored mother fucker?

1278
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,031
Someone's dangerous.

1279
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:37,281
I was,

1280
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:37,710
I was,

1281
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,570
I was at Bella tour.

1282
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,630
I was Abella toyed with,

1283
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:39,950
um,

1284
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:44,290
with Chili and Bomba juicy
shillings fight great.

1285
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,410
He looked great.

1286
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,710
He looks like he looks like
a completely different guy.

1287
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,560
We were in the dressing room warming up.

1288
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,210
He's warming up and he's hitting mitts.

1289
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,470
And um,

1290
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,490
my first thought was,

1291
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:55,791
yeah,

1292
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:59,240
he looks like he's doing the
defensive takedowns sitting low.

1293
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,590
It's more comfortable,

1294
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,221
like,

1295
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:01,431
yeah,

1296
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:02,480
he's a different dude.

1297
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,440
He's very different.

1298
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,010
He's putting,

1299
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,900
he's got to that point where you,

1300
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:06,734
um,

1301
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:07,760
it's not,

1302
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,600
it's not uncomfortable to wrestle like
he didn't know what to do for a long time

1303
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,740
and I've been gone for a while.

1304
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:13,690
I came back and he was,

1305
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,470
he was out there with
cowboy and Mickey and,

1306
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:15,691
and,

1307
00:34:15,691 --> 00:34:15,881
and,

1308
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:17,030
and Jafar even near.

1309
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,490
And those guys really helped him and I'm,

1310
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,690
I'm rolling with him and I'm like,

1311
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:20,931
oh,

1312
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:22,250
this is a different character.

1313
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,210
You know,

1314
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:23,600
I'm like,

1315
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,710
this is not going to be easy.

1316
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:25,330
I better get my,

1317
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,870
I bet a tap him now while I can,

1318
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,240
you know.

1319
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:28,431
Well,

1320
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:30,920
he's a world class kickboxer,

1321
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,350
so in when it comes to the standup game,

1322
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,740
he's going to have an advantage over
almost everybody as long as he can defend

1323
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,900
take downs and as long as he fight smart,

1324
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:40,341
you know,

1325
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:41,960
if he doesn't fight recklessly,

1326
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:42,320
which is,

1327
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:42,591
you know,

1328
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:46,940
we had in the past that a Japanese
fellow that knocked him out twice.

1329
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,570
Yes.

1330
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,403
What's the car's name?

1331
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:48,950
Cocoon.

1332
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:49,380
What's unknown?

1333
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:49,620
That's.

1334
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:49,791
No,

1335
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:50,630
that's not his name.

1336
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,630
I'm horrible Japanese names.

1337
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,420
They all sound the same because of Beasto.

1338
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:59,400
I got hit so fucking
hard that joe his heart.

1339
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,120
Joe Does.

1340
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,890
It really hits hard.

1341
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,723
Saki.

1342
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,451
Saki.

1343
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:02,930
Kado.

1344
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,710
Yeah.

1345
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,940
That guy is a beast though.

1346
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,800
That guy fought in mma
and then follow them.

1347
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:07,634
Kickboxing.

1348
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,280
I mean that's what it
would have been stuck.

1349
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:09,950
It is.

1350
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:13,000
And it's not really a kickboxer
as much as he is a fighter,

1351
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,840
but joe is.

1352
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,430
Joe is turning into an MMA fighter,

1353
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,510
so as hip for sure.

1354
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:18,010
So I'm.

1355
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:23,010
So I'm duke everything and on top of
secured top position held him and ground

1356
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,390
and pound was can

1357
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,560
a real strikers,

1358
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,370
real strikers have horrific ground because
they just congenital it so much more

1359
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:32,450
power from the top.

1360
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,800
It's just terrifying,

1361
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:34,700
you know?

1362
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:34,970
Yeah.

1363
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:35,930
Now that he knows how to,

1364
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,740
how to control his hips
when he's on the ground.

1365
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:37,890
Yeah.

1366
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,060
It's just a different story.

1367
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,111
I want to see.

1368
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:40,944
Um,

1369
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,390
I want to see where he goes and now he's,

1370
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:42,721
he's like,

1371
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:45,540
it's weird because now he's like
a prospect in a different way.

1372
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,640
Well,

1373
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,540
he just needed to fix that one piece of
his game and he fixed that one piece of

1374
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:51,871
his game,

1375
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:53,620
the grappling and the
take down the fences.

1376
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,940
I want to see joe get
to the point where he's,

1377
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,280
um,

1378
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,960
he's completely comfortable on the ground.

1379
00:35:57,961 --> 00:35:58,111
He's,

1380
00:35:58,111 --> 00:35:58,440
he's,

1381
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,273
he's close to it,

1382
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,950
but like an two or three
years down the road,

1383
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,180
him and style bender.

1384
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,583
Right?

1385
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,130
Stop under anders.

1386
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,150
Special kind of dude.

1387
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:09,371
Yeah.

1388
00:36:09,371 --> 00:36:10,040
Yes.

1389
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,890
Especially kind of do that.

1390
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:12,220
Derek Brunson fight showed it.

1391
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,520
It's like this special kind of dude.

1392
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,650
I like that kid who diseases.

1393
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:17,581
Yeah.

1394
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:18,420
He's fun to watch,

1395
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:18,660
man.

1396
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,493
He's slick.

1397
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,850
He's slick.

1398
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,040
He's fighting Anderson next.

1399
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,310
I don't like that phrase.

1400
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,853
Yeah,

1401
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,120
I don't like these fights were
like I didn't like a year and Bj,

1402
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:30,901
I don't,

1403
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:34,250
I don't like these fights were like these
guys who've done so much for the game

1404
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,600
are kinda getting fed
to the wolves in their,

1405
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,380
in their twilight,

1406
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,680
but every now and then
you get a Shogun Tyson.

1407
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:44,760
Pedro fight the fucking
old lion roars again.

1408
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:45,421
Right?

1409
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:46,254
Do you see that fight?

1410
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,860
I missed all the UFC fights this weekend
because of Bella tour and the boxing

1411
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:50,191
match.

1412
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,700
Shogun returned from adversity to.

1413
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,970
I heard harden that fight.

1414
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:55,530
He got staggered and fucked up.

1415
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,500
Tyson poured it on but
couldn't keep it up.

1416
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:00,660
And then shogun got him to the ground,

1417
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:01,830
smashed him up a bit,

1418
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,360
got them standing up,

1419
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,550
hit him with a big right
hand at the end of the fight,

1420
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:08,790
dropped him and then beat the fuck out
of them on the ground is like it was.

1421
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,050
It was for me.

1422
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,180
When I saw that fight announced Tyson.

1423
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:13,230
Pedro was struggles like,

1424
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:13,591
Damn.

1425
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:14,910
Sjogren's got another hard fight.

1426
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,440
It's hard watching shogun get
knocked out a bunch of times,

1427
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,090
but he won and he won a big way
and he wanted a war was a war.

1428
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:25,770
He still fuck.

1429
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,300
He still a fucking bad ass.

1430
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,510
How is shogun still so
goddamn aggressive too.

1431
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,460
Like he's not slow down.

1432
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,150
It was like real frantic and
aggressive and it was awesome.

1433
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,620
This thing inside you,

1434
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,460
right?

1435
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,600
You can't get rid of that.

1436
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,141
Well,

1437
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:40,711
some dudes,

1438
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:44,460
they lose a bit of it when they take too
much punishment there they lose some of

1439
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:47,490
the ferocity or some of the
enthusiasm or whatever the fuck it is.

1440
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,960
But I was one of the things.

1441
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:49,830
I was watching that fight.

1442
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:50,101
I was like,

1443
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,130
God Damn Shogun,

1444
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,983
ferocious,

1445
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,190
ferocious,

1446
00:37:53,191 --> 00:37:54,480
just everything about it.

1447
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,470
Like when he got,

1448
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,191
had to do to hurt,

1449
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,390
he was fucking porn it on,

1450
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,760
but it was pointed on in a demonic way,

1451
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:00,960
like a monster.

1452
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:01,800
Like he was like,

1453
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,410
he was enjoying it.

1454
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,243
Like he was shogun.

1455
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,950
Shogun of old man.

1456
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:06,890
Yeah.

1457
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,590
This is it.

1458
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,170
I mean he fought really well too.

1459
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,090
Like his ground game was real solid.

1460
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:13,830
His ground and pound was real solid,

1461
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,630
but it was also like his,

1462
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,400
his,

1463
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,430
the exchanges.

1464
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,410
He would be wanting to find openings.

1465
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:22,380
He was frantic and very real aggressive.

1466
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,243
Yeah,

1467
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,680
it was a.

1468
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,511
It was an awesome fight,

1469
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:24,990
man.

1470
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,261
Yeah,

1471
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,010
man.

1472
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,551
I had a fight.

1473
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:27,384
Pass this.

1474
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,500
Yeah,

1475
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,281
it was an fs.

1476
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:29,761
One thing.

1477
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:30,210
I don't know when.

1478
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,110
When did they put those efforts?

1479
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:32,970
One fights on fight pass.

1480
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,960
I think it's like a month
because that what it is.

1481
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,771
I think go,

1482
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,250
go further

1483
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,250
ahead of this because this is a long
period where Tyson was trying to secure

1484
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:42,580
Kamora.

1485
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:42,931
You don't.

1486
00:38:42,931 --> 00:38:43,751
You don't go overseas,

1487
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:44,230
right?

1488
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,190
Not Anymore.

1489
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,620
Now those would cripple me,

1490
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:48,040
man.

1491
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,500
Those fucking those overseas things.

1492
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,230
There's where you dropped
them with the right hand?

1493
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,333
Yeah,

1494
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,520
they direct me for a week
and a half afterwards.

1495
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,390
I'd be exhausted.

1496
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:03,120
Fucking Brazil or fly
to Australia is worse.

1497
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,030
That's what I was going to say.

1498
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:04,691
I was like Brazil.

1499
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:05,860
Isn't that just like north south?

1500
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:06,490
Pretty much.

1501
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:06,881
It is,

1502
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:08,860
but it's still 16 hours on a plane.

1503
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:09,700
Really?

1504
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,330
Yeah.

1505
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:10,571
Yeah.

1506
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:14,230
You got to fly to Miami and then
you get a flat 10 more hours to Rio.

1507
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,360
It's 10 hours from Miami to real.

1508
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,470
Yeah.

1509
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,210
I didn't realize that.

1510
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,250
The South America zone,

1511
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,270
that's a whole nother country.

1512
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,100
Different continent.

1513
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,290
I loved being there.

1514
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:27,280
I hated getting there.

1515
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,180
I hated going home.

1516
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,710
I hated how I felt afterwards.

1517
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,850
And I'm just too busy.

1518
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:31,780
It's just too.

1519
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,780
It's too costly for me financially
to take that much time off.

1520
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,771
And it's also,

1521
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:37,600
it's just too hard for me physically,

1522
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,380
you know?

1523
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,710
So if they compensated you for the time,

1524
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:42,180
it's dope.

1525
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,013
Physically

1526
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,510
know fuck you money.

1527
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,440
But uh,

1528
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,870
I,

1529
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,210
you know what the other problem is man,

1530
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,550
this fucking TV and watch it on fight.

1531
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:56,260
Pass doing fight companions.

1532
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,750
You know those fight
companions of the shit

1533
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:00,940
we did.

1534
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,110
I did that one with you in jail.

1535
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,381
Yeah,

1536
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:03,300
we did more glory.

1537
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:03,671
Yeah,

1538
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:04,504
we got to do another one.

1539
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,700
We'll definitely do it for,

1540
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,371
for a UFC.

1541
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:06,971
Yes,

1542
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:07,804
yes.

1543
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,260
Yeah.

1544
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:08,990
Let's pick one.

1545
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,460
You got it.

1546
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,293
You know what?

1547
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,830
What are you going to be for new years?

1548
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,630
I'm going to be on vacation.

1549
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:14,290
Oh,

1550
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:14,770
okay.

1551
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:14,861
Well,

1552
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:15,694
I was going to say,

1553
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,580
if you're here,

1554
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,590
do a do a fight,

1555
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,910
do a fight companion for the.

1556
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,393
For PFL.

1557
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:20,721
Yeah.

1558
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:21,910
So tell me about pfl.

1559
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:22,750
So you are,

1560
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,320
you're doing commentary for the PFL
commentary and telestrator and who else is

1561
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:27,100
doing it with you?

1562
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,630
Randy and Randy and Boston.

1563
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:29,711
What a combination.

1564
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:30,280
Right?

1565
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,150
What a fucking combination.

1566
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:31,410
When,

1567
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:31,581
when,

1568
00:40:31,581 --> 00:40:33,010
when I got that call and they were like,

1569
00:40:33,011 --> 00:40:35,540
in the team is going to
be you randy in Boston.

1570
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:35,771
Like,

1571
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:35,951
wait,

1572
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:39,760
you just put my name in the same sentence
that those dudes is like as equals.

1573
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,170
And it's like for me,

1574
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:41,770
like I get,

1575
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,820
I get like some fly,

1576
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,260
some fight fans may be thinking,

1577
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:44,471
yeah,

1578
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:45,071
that makes sense.

1579
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:45,851
But like for me,

1580
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:47,500
I'm like these guys I looked up to,

1581
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,311
you know,

1582
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:49,850
and now I get to,

1583
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,430
I get to hang out with them and you know,

1584
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:52,630
we're having a drink at the bar.

1585
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,680
That's pretty amazing.

1586
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,461
But listen dude,

1587
00:40:54,461 --> 00:40:55,690
you're a really good commentator.

1588
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,460
You're really good analysts to.

1589
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,280
I loved watching the Fox decks desk.

1590
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,860
I loved the way you break down things.

1591
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:03,260
You know,

1592
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,880
one of the cool things about that desk
is you'll have like a Michael bisping or

1593
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,740
your half in or you know,

1594
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:09,640
a Kenny Florian,

1595
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:10,474
whoever it is,

1596
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:14,170
everyone's got their own idea
of how to fight and what,

1597
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,620
what,

1598
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,870
what's important and what they think
is going to be a problem in a fight.

1599
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,750
Like that's such a great move to have
these x fighters and continue to,

1600
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:23,050
you know,

1601
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,580
10 cormier is always doing it.

1602
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:29,530
Continue to have them explaining
from their own experience.

1603
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,483
Yeah.

1604
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,761
Yeah.

1605
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:31,061
That's,

1606
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:31,840
um,

1607
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,040
that was the first thing for.

1608
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,010
Because I

1609
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,221
didn't,

1610
00:41:34,221 --> 00:41:34,701
I was like,

1611
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,570
I don't know what I'm doing.

1612
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,320
You know,

1613
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,000
I have no idea what it is I'm doing,

1614
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:42,160
but it's just talking about fights and
it's so much fun to be doing it with,

1615
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,900
with guys that are on that
same level because you know,

1616
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:45,680
you're at home,

1617
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,550
you probably do it when,

1618
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:46,791
when,

1619
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:49,900
when you're at home and you're not doing
a fight companion watching fights and

1620
00:41:49,901 --> 00:41:50,810
maybe some friends around,

1621
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:52,400
they ask you things about
fights and you're like,

1622
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,770
you have to explain it to
people who don't understand.

1623
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,520
But when you're having a conversation
with somebody who knows what's going on

1624
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,570
and then you can eat,

1625
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:03,350
especially when you come to a point where
you disagree because you have strong,

1626
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,400
you have strong opinions.

1627
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:04,680
Why?

1628
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,090
And you have strong arguments as to why
you're right and why the other guy's

1629
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:08,750
wrong.

1630
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,161
And I,

1631
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:09,651
I dunno,

1632
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:10,010
I like,

1633
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,420
I love those moments man.

1634
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,470
I love having those things.

1635
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:15,470
Especially being able to do that with
guys who know what they're talking about.

1636
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:15,741
Oh,

1637
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,290
it makes it so much more fun when
you're doing it with guys who know what

1638
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:18,921
they're talking about.

1639
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:22,550
What's one of the cool things about fight
companion is that were set when Brian

1640
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,403
counselors talking.

1641
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,463
Just kidding,

1642
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,310
just kidding Brian.

1643
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,000
Just kidding.

1644
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,570
But when,

1645
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,570
when you're doing it like everybody's
got their own opinion of how something

1646
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:30,890
could go down or how,

1647
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:31,141
what,

1648
00:42:31,141 --> 00:42:32,060
what's gonna be a problem?

1649
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,200
A lot of times you agree,

1650
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:33,880
you know,

1651
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,190
like the,

1652
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,670
like the till Tyron Woodley fight
will tills chances standing up.

1653
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,511
That's it.

1654
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:39,111
And you know,

1655
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:40,730
if I was tired I'd take him to the ground.

1656
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,740
I mean determines a far better wrestler.

1657
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:43,090
Far,

1658
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:43,350
much,

1659
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,390
much more experience,

1660
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,130
but like there's some fights were like,

1661
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:46,401
man,

1662
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:46,941
I like,

1663
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:48,050
here's one this weekend,

1664
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,131
Brian Ortega,

1665
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:49,964
Max Holloway.

1666
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,780
Oh fuck.

1667
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,890
Knows how that's going to go.

1668
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:52,941
Like I've,

1669
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:54,900
I've bounced that one
around my head and people,

1670
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,330
people would come up to
me on the street like,

1671
00:42:56,331 --> 00:42:56,840
hey man,

1672
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,040
who's going to win this
fight this weekend?

1673
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,180
Especially Hawaiians.

1674
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,990
Hawaiians are super excited
for Max Holloway to win again.

1675
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,460
I mean he's the new Bj Penn.

1676
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,323
Right.

1677
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,980
And theRe may be a different level.

1678
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,390
Max max hallways,

1679
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:09,750
a mother fucker.

1680
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:10,580
That's,

1681
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,630
that's one of those fights.

1682
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:11,871
YeAh.

1683
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:15,030
It's very hard to pick
a it was that even like,

1684
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,170
it's pretty even gotta be.

1685
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:16,400
I mean,

1686
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:16,580
what,

1687
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:16,780
what,

1688
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,080
what the vegas odds are.

1689
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:18,801
I,

1690
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:19,161
by the way,

1691
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:22,790
I love the fact that you can
actually gamble on fights now online.

1692
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,430
Like it's lean,

1693
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,263
it's legal.

1694
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,420
They kind of do it right.

1695
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,130
If you were fighting with myself,

1696
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,140
depending on the state to
have too much pressure,

1697
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,440
I wouldn't want to think
about it unless I knew,

1698
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:38,260
unless the guy was a fucking asshole
and now I'm going to go smash this.

1699
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,950
Like there's just no.

1700
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,180
Very close.

1701
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,550
They're both minus,

1702
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:44,290
minus one,

1703
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,230
minus 1:25,

1704
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:48,020
which would be all the
favorite slight favorite.

1705
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:48,981
does that make sense?

1706
00:43:48,981 --> 00:43:49,310
Yeah,

1707
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:50,143
that makes sense.

1708
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,410
That should be how it is.

1709
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,830
Slight favorite because he's the champion
and you know it's interesting with

1710
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:56,240
hallway said he goes,

1711
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:56,991
he goes,

1712
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:59,060
it's kind of weird when he goes.

1713
00:43:59,061 --> 00:44:00,350
It's kind of weird when the,

1714
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,520
the new thing is older
than the current thing.

1715
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,120
Cause it's like I'm younger man.

1716
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:09,200
I'm the fucking champ.

1717
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:09,561
I beat.

1718
00:44:09,561 --> 00:44:11,030
Although I'd been all these dudes,

1719
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:14,960
I'm younger and yet this guy is the
new thing coming up and challenge me.

1720
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,861
It's like motherfucker,

1721
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:16,940
I'm the younger fighter.

1722
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,170
It's kind of funny.

1723
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:18,951
Well yeah,

1724
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:19,940
I mean we haven't seen,

1725
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,880
we haven't seen something like
or tag a little bit in um,

1726
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,910
in the featherweight division
guy submitting like only
submissions off to like

1727
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,950
the one with cub.

1728
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,790
Yeah.

1729
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:31,050
Yeah.

1730
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,100
I think that was beautiful.

1731
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:34,140
Like he readjusted on that teaM too.

1732
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:34,530
That's,

1733
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:37,110
that's probably the hardest
submission to readjust,

1734
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,470
you know,

1735
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:43,290
one hand hanging on readjusting and then
still sinking it in against cubs won.

1736
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:48,210
It's not like it's not like Brandon
Bishop or whoever it's comes once.

1737
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,450
You know what I mean?

1738
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,550
That's like,

1739
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,540
that's crazy man.

1740
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:52,643
Well,

1741
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,050
he's a direct lineage,

1742
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:55,291
right?

1743
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,720
He's real gracie jujitsu.

1744
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,850
He is henner and he Iran,

1745
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:00,810
you know he's come.

1746
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,270
He comes from horry on that school.

1747
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,070
I mean this is where brian comes from.

1748
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:10,071
He's direct from those mats and his
technique is like razor blades so sharp.

1749
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:16,030
It's so sharp and precise and so honed
and just through drills and a constant

1750
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:19,200
emphasis on proper leverage and position.

1751
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,580
I mean there are sticklers to that
old style of jujitsu and some people.

1752
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,300
There's an unfortunate word that people
like to use that sometimes pisses people

1753
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:27,420
off.

1754
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,080
Like vinny magalhaes use this to describe
minataro and he didn't mean it in a

1755
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:31,890
negative way,

1756
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,210
but he meant the basics.

1757
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,950
He's like his jujitsu is very basic.

1758
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,980
He'd ended up people go
fucking my jujitsu is basic,

1759
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:40,530
but the basic is like the best,

1760
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:41,364
the fundamentals,

1761
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:46,460
but these guys that have those
basics like hotter gracie,

1762
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,610
his jujitsu is.

1763
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,500
He's mostly the basics.

1764
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:53,370
He's not doing any crazy della hiva
shit or anything that you've never seen

1765
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:53,851
before.

1766
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:54,684
Like,

1767
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,110
yeah,

1768
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:55,921
he's not doing anything.

1769
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,090
We never saw it before.

1770
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,320
It's strict,

1771
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,040
you know,

1772
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,491
guard,

1773
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:00,001
pass,

1774
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:01,290
smashing on top,

1775
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:01,921
triangle,

1776
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:02,701
mount arm,

1777
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:04,170
triangle armbar.

1778
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,600
Everything he does is classic jujitsu,

1779
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:09,270
but it's just so perfect.

1780
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:09,871
Everything,

1781
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:13,350
the leverage and the
weight and the emphasis on,

1782
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:13,840
you know,

1783
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,540
certain positions over others.

1784
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:20,130
It's all like basic classic
jujitsu and that's Brian Ortega.

1785
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:24,840
His jujitsu is just so
rock solid fundamentals.

1786
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:25,530
You know,

1787
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,050
he's all about fundamentals,

1788
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,110
man.

1789
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,190
Even his box,

1790
00:46:29,191 --> 00:46:29,670
he's not,

1791
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:31,980
I don't believe he's as
good a boxer as as Max,

1792
00:46:31,981 --> 00:46:36,981
but he's fundamentally sound strong
and direct with his boxing mean.

1793
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,240
He knocked out frankie,

1794
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,620
he knocked out frankie.

1795
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:45,290
He submitted my condo who I think is one
of the dark horse in that division and

1796
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,310
auto marcano is a fucking beast.

1797
00:46:47,311 --> 00:46:48,144
Man.

1798
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,610
Mike brown has nothing but praise for him,

1799
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:50,970
man.

1800
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,451
He's like,

1801
00:46:51,451 --> 00:46:52,650
that kid is legit.

1802
00:46:52,651 --> 00:46:52,930
He's,

1803
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,330
he's going to challenge for that title.

1804
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:55,170
I believe that.

1805
00:46:55,171 --> 00:47:00,120
I believe that and he's super respectful
and intelligent and like everything

1806
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:01,110
about him I like.

1807
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:01,920
I love his,

1808
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,753
his approach,

1809
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:05,010
the way he fights and in that fight,

1810
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,630
hollowell or excuse me,

1811
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,700
ortega made him shoot because he was
beating him standing up and he shot and

1812
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:12,140
ortega.

1813
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,973
I think you

1814
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,331
that good team.

1815
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:17,010
It's just a death grip.

1816
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,510
He's just got a vice.

1817
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,700
Just clamps down on your fucking life,

1818
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:23,820
put you to sleep.

1819
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:24,570
There's no room,

1820
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,171
there's no room.

1821
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:27,120
You're going To sleep
or you're going to tap.

1822
00:47:27,121 --> 00:47:28,110
You need a kid.

1823
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,290
he's my size.

1824
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:29,890
He's big.

1825
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:30,160
He's

1826
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,541
a big.

1827
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:31,320
He's big.

1828
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,640
Macs is big to their max is huge.

1829
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,680
Max was 185.

1830
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:39,230
When they told him about the fight,

1831
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,620
the horrible thing about that fight
was that he lost all that weight really

1832
00:47:44,621 --> 00:47:49,540
rapidly for no reason and then they
wound up pulling him out of the fight,

1833
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:51,250
know the commissioners like fuck this.

1834
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:52,000
You can't fight.

1835
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,500
And a lot of us at the time were like,

1836
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,800
why is the commission telling the
champion whether or not he could make,

1837
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:57,011
wait,

1838
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:58,330
let him try to make weight.

1839
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,470
Get the fuck out of there.

1840
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,430
You don't know what you're doing,

1841
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:05,610
but then you find out after that that
like when he was preparing for the first

1842
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:10,780
fight with ortega and he was experiencing
these weird concussion like symptoms

1843
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:11,201
symptoms,

1844
00:48:11,201 --> 00:48:13,570
but they said he didn't have a
concussion and then people will say,

1845
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:13,721
no,

1846
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:14,680
this is weight loss,

1847
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,390
this is rapid weight cuttings.

1848
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,570
Body is responding to the fact that you
just went through this and now I was

1849
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:21,700
trying to do it again and
his body's rejecting it.

1850
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,080
So this is a bunch of theories.

1851
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,153
There's not.

1852
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,760
They're not giving us a whole
lot of information about
exactly what's wrong with

1853
00:48:27,761 --> 00:48:29,410
him medically or what was wrong.

1854
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,910
Whether theY know it or not,

1855
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:31,550
I don't know.

1856
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:31,990
Right.

1857
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:36,430
But even or take has been saying all week
like what the fuck was wrong with him?

1858
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,240
Why not?

1859
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,540
How come they're not telling us like what
if it happens again or take has got to

1860
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:41,374
be thinking right now.

1861
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,580
Here we are today.

1862
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,750
It's wednesday,

1863
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,250
tomorrow's thursday.

1864
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:46,150
The weigh ins friday.

1865
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:50,380
He'll only got a couple of days like we
don't know whether or not this is even

1866
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:51,250
actually going to happen.

1867
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:51,760
right?

1868
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,420
Like what if it gets down to thursday
and friday and he's in the middle of the

1869
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:58,780
weight cut and he starts blacking out
or he starts experiencing those symptoms

1870
00:48:58,781 --> 00:48:58,960
again.

1871
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,360
They pull them out of the
car more ikonos on standby,

1872
00:49:01,361 --> 00:49:02,194
you know,

1873
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:07,420
I did not know that he's on standby
for this fight that he see and then it

1874
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:08,440
becomes an interim title.

1875
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,400
It must,

1876
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,420
it has to be.

1877
00:49:10,421 --> 00:49:11,290
They're not going to strip them,

1878
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,220
but then what happens?

1879
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:16,540
I mean a guy like max that I don't know.

1880
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:16,710
It's,

1881
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:18,420
it's one of those
situations where it's like,

1882
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,290
if that happens multiple times,

1883
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,370
like what do you have to do?

1884
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:21,641
Kim,

1885
00:49:21,641 --> 00:49:22,540
can you continue to,

1886
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,580
how much longer can you continue
to fight at that weight?

1887
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,490
I don't think he can continue to fight
it that way very much longer because I

1888
00:49:27,491 --> 00:49:30,430
think he severely compromises
himself getting done in 45.

1889
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:32,470
But he's been able to do
it because he's a champion.

1890
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,131
But.

1891
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:35,090
And I think if you do have a,

1892
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,390
a like a george lockhart in your corner,

1893
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,020
a guy that gets you to do it
scientifically and they rehydrate yourself

1894
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:41,854
scientifically,

1895
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:45,460
it can be done and you can
pull it off in 24 hours later.

1896
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,230
You can fight at a very high level.

1897
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,790
But is that the way to go?

1898
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:49,730
I mean,

1899
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,310
the kidneys start breaking down,

1900
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,480
your body starts getting beat up and
your organs don't want to get dried out

1901
00:49:55,481 --> 00:49:56,314
like that.

1902
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,030
Your brain doesn't want to
get dried out like that.

1903
00:49:58,031 --> 00:50:00,100
Your muscles don't want to
get dried out like that.

1904
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,280
There's just no way you perform at your
best when you're just at death's door 24

1905
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:06,820
hours ago.

1906
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,020
And now here you're fighting again.

1907
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,153
Yeah,

1908
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,053
I mean,

1909
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,133
frankie,

1910
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:11,561
you know,

1911
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:12,790
when he was fighting at lightweight,

1912
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:13,860
you know,

1913
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:18,860
that kinda kinda shows you that you
can be the smaller guy and do well.

1914
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:25,320
But it's weird because like now frankie
said a bar and now guys reached that bar

1915
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:28,700
so he had to change weight classes.

1916
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:29,430
You know,

1917
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:29,910
that's,

1918
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:30,743
it's a weird thing.

1919
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:31,800
And everybody's gonna.

1920
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,001
I mean,

1921
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:32,630
it's the fight game.

1922
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:33,000
You always,

1923
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,770
you try to get the best out of yourself
and you try to get the biggest advantage

1924
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:37,604
that you can,

1925
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,710
so the weight cut's
gonna always be an issue.

1926
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:44,711
Unless the way classes are changed
and or weIgh ins become same day.

1927
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,700
Well josh thompson just said recently
that he thinks that the ufc is getting rid

1928
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:51,190
of the 125 pound division.

1929
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:53,120
They're got to put on a
one 65 pound division,

1930
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,530
which I think is very interesting.

1931
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,450
If they do do a one 65,

1932
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,080
I would like them to switch
one 72 [inaudible] 75.

1933
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:00,290
I think that would be wise.

1934
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:02,690
I don't think it's wise
to have a 65 and 75,

1935
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:05,090
but I do think of 65 and 75 is great,

1936
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:05,983
right?

1937
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:06,381
Yeah,

1938
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:07,214
I agree.

1939
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,680
I 10 pounds 10 pounds is good.

1940
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,480
I think across the board,

1941
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:13,340
I think we had every 10
pounds of weight class.

1942
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,950
I mean a lot of people
don't like the boxing thing.

1943
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:18,080
There's so many champions
and so many weight classes,

1944
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:20,150
but who fucking cares?

1945
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,133
Who cares?

1946
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,440
Who cares that there's a welterweight and
then a super welterweight really cares

1947
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:25,940
that it's only seVen pounds difference.

1948
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,793
This is more fights.

1949
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,680
It's more fights,

1950
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,490
more champions.

1951
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,990
It's more champion versus champion.

1952
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:30,830
I mean,

1953
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:31,940
don't you want to see that?

1954
00:51:31,941 --> 00:51:32,690
I want to see that.

1955
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,081
I want is.

1956
00:51:33,081 --> 00:51:33,380
Yeah.

1957
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,790
I want to see the best in the best.

1958
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,050
Yeah.

1959
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:35,631
You know what I mean?

1960
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:35,881
We're,

1961
00:51:35,881 --> 00:51:36,471
we're getting,

1962
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:38,300
we're getting some of the
best of the best right now.

1963
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:39,134
You get the number.

1964
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,790
Let's say Kevin Lee.

1965
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,160
Kevin lee could be 165 pound champion.

1966
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:43,581
Yes.

1967
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:43,920
But.

1968
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,270
And probably that's his weight
class struggles to make 1:55.

1969
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:47,990
He's a bIg fella.

1970
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:51,440
He's a big dude but then
can't do it anymore.

1971
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,330
But like tyron wrestled at one 65.

1972
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,220
Imagine if he was still that age,

1973
00:51:55,221 --> 00:51:55,461
you know,

1974
00:51:55,461 --> 00:51:56,870
and he could fight at one 65.

1975
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,820
Get tyron can make 65.

1976
00:51:59,090 --> 00:51:59,631
I've been tiring.

1977
00:51:59,631 --> 00:52:00,450
Can make 65.

1978
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,060
I think he can make 65.

1979
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,700
I definitely think he could
fight at 75 and be at his best.

1980
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,620
And I think he could also fight at 85.

1981
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,950
I think tyron has legitimate potential
to be a three division champion.

1982
00:52:09,951 --> 00:52:10,850
He should start.

1983
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,740
You should start rallying for that.

1984
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,450
For that 65 pound weight class.

1985
00:52:14,451 --> 00:52:15,410
Nobody listens to me anymore.

1986
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,890
If they listened to me,

1987
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:19,520
melvIn manhoef would've been
in the ufc back in 2002.

1988
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,830
They listen to me sometimes.

1989
00:52:21,831 --> 00:52:26,480
I think they listen to me with ben aspirin
on record and I'm gonna say I'm a big

1990
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:28,220
reason why I've been
asking and gotten the ufc.

1991
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,610
I brokered a meeting
between him and dana white.

1992
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,150
Okay,

1993
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:32,421
dude.

1994
00:52:32,421 --> 00:52:33,254
I put it together.

1995
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,370
I called dana.

1996
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:34,641
I said,

1997
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:34,791
look,

1998
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:35,571
he's a good guy,

1999
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:35,811
man.

2000
00:52:35,811 --> 00:52:36,501
He's talking shit.

2001
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:37,760
But everybody talks shit like,

2002
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:38,623
come on.

2003
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:38,901
I'm like,

2004
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:39,980
the guys undefeated.

2005
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:40,821
And he's like,

2006
00:52:40,821 --> 00:52:41,090
uh.

2007
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:41,431
He was like,

2008
00:52:41,431 --> 00:52:42,620
when ambien wants to go to sleep,

2009
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:43,560
it takes ben aspirin

2010
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,840
and I'm like fighting.

2011
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:48,411
See,

2012
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:52,830
the thing about fighting is it's
not a matter of what is the,

2013
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,670
what's exciting to watch
for a person like you,

2014
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,010
a person like me who's
like sitting by the.

2015
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:59,000
How is this going to play out?

2016
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:00,603
What's gonna work?

2017
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:01,520
What's gonna work?

2018
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,353
What works?

2019
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:03,370
I get that.

2020
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:03,920
Yeah.

2021
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,190
I want to see what works when when I see
a guy like ben asked her and I want to

2022
00:53:07,191 --> 00:53:08,690
see what works well,

2023
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,700
he's a three to one
favorite over robbie lawler.

2024
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:11,720
Holy shit.

2025
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,740
That's crazy.

2026
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:14,270
Just added another fight to this card.

2027
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,021
Listen man,

2028
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:19,150
you can't sleep on robbie fucking law.

2029
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,440
Don't sleep on robbie lawler.

2030
00:53:21,441 --> 00:53:22,460
That's crazy.

2031
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,691
That's crazy.

2032
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:25,400
Three to 1:30.

2033
00:53:25,401 --> 00:53:26,330
One is horror glued.

2034
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,530
Robbie lawler can bressler.

2035
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:31,830
Robin has been shutting people's
lights out since the early two.

2036
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:32,664
Thousands.

2037
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:33,623
Decent bet then.

2038
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,620
So fucking good.

2039
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,573
I would take,

2040
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:40,630
I'd take the robbie lawler six actually
being three to 100 to make $300 plus

2041
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:44,064
2:30.

2042
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,840
Two 33 to one.

2043
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,670
So you'd have to win the bet
three to win one on aspirin,

2044
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:48,920
right?

2045
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,410
Correct.

2046
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:50,220
Yeah.

2047
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:50,460
Yeah,

2048
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,151
I'd take that bad.

2049
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:51,751
It's a good bet,

2050
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:52,110
but I,

2051
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:56,640
I'd like aspirin's chances because I
think that wrestling is just on another

2052
00:53:56,641 --> 00:53:57,660
level.

2053
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:58,320
Yeah,

2054
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,250
that's the fight.

2055
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,180
Here's the fight.

2056
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,040
One 65 khabib.

2057
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:02,910
Ben aspirin.

2058
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,510
I guess bank could make 6,500 percent.

2059
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:11,370
He can make 6,500 percent.

2060
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,031
One hundred percent.

2061
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:15,240
He wants to make 65 because he's good
friends with tyron and he's like,

2062
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:18,150
I'll be the 65 pound champ
tire and be the 70 or 75,

2063
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:18,361
whatever.

2064
00:54:18,361 --> 00:54:20,010
They decided to go with that.

2065
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,540
That's the fight khabib
versus ben asked me,

2066
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,460
because I'm teLling you man,

2067
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,510
ben aspirin,

2068
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:28,560
they just put his face on the camera the
other day while he was in the crowd and

2069
00:54:28,561 --> 00:54:29,720
the audience went crazy.

2070
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:32,490
This isn't even fought in
the ufc and they love him.

2071
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,270
Yeah.

2072
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,610
Fight real has as that.

2073
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,401
Didn't know who he is.

2074
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:36,750
Now they know who he is now.

2075
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:38,610
It's like he's been building momentum.

2076
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,840
The hardcore fans.

2077
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:40,391
Absolutely.

2078
00:54:40,391 --> 00:54:45,391
You're excited that finally
this undefeated fee nom of
a wrestler is fighting in

2079
00:54:45,721 --> 00:54:46,231
the ufc?

2080
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:47,064
Yeah,

2081
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:48,103
I would.

2082
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:48,280
Yeah.

2083
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,250
I would pay money to watch him fucked.

2084
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:50,760
Yeah,

2085
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,540
for sure.

2086
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,373
A lot of money.

2087
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,620
I'll fly to Russia for that fight.

2088
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,350
You think that's where they have it?

2089
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:58,021
Fuck,

2090
00:54:58,021 --> 00:54:58,381
I don't know,

2091
00:54:58,381 --> 00:54:58,531
man.

2092
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:01,110
I'm about to fly to Russia
and commentate that fight.

2093
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:01,381
Yeah,

2094
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,130
and I'm going to,

2095
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,480
as soon as I get to my hotel room,

2096
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,231
I'm going to have one of them.

2097
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:04,531
Things,

2098
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:05,364
it checks for bugs.

2099
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:08,550
Did you check for hidden cameras and

2100
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:11,103
he cut

2101
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,760
it up like a christmas tree?

2102
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:15,630
Yeah,

2103
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:15,821
it will.

2104
00:55:15,821 --> 00:55:18,670
Probably would write the whole
house is a fucking bug that.

2105
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:19,261
Yeah,

2106
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:19,441
man,

2107
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,360
I think that's a.

2108
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:20,900
That's,

2109
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,960
that's a fight that I'm very,

2110
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:24,300
very excited about because like right now,

2111
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,420
khabib,

2112
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:29,430
the number one fight for khabib
I believe is tony ferguson.

2113
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,760
I think that's a big fight.

2114
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:31,594
A giant fight.

2115
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,000
I'm real excited about that.

2116
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:33,541
I like that.

2117
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:33,930
I heard,

2118
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:38,930
I heard rumors and I was spoken to
dustin of that whole tony and khabib,

2119
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,910
dustin and conor fight each other.

2120
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,290
I heard that too,

2121
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,120
but here's the cynical part of me.

2122
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,840
I know that nate diaz was
supposed to be fighting dustin,

2123
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:51,330
but dustin had a pull
out with a hip injury,

2124
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:51,751
so I'm like,

2125
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:51,961
okay,

2126
00:55:51,961 --> 00:55:54,990
well how bad is his hip injury
and when is that going to heal up,

2127
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:55,511
you know,

2128
00:55:55,511 --> 00:55:57,000
and isn't going to heal up,

2129
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,890
or is it going to be a reoccurring thing?

2130
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:03,780
And them saying that dustin is going to
step in and he's going to fight conor.

2131
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:05,550
That is a good fight.

2132
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,590
But does that make nate diaz go?

2133
00:56:07,591 --> 00:56:09,460
what does that make nate?

2134
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:13,750
Nate diaz come back to the bargaining
table and then they have like.

2135
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,020
Because that's the big money fight.

2136
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:15,780
Big money.

2137
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,680
If I was a promoter,

2138
00:56:16,681 --> 00:56:17,514
I'm not a promoter.

2139
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,450
If I was a promoter,

2140
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,030
I'd be like,

2141
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:19,290
nate,

2142
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,123
what are we going to do?

2143
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,040
Got to get weed.

2144
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,190
We got to get girls to.

2145
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:23,680
Do you want a new bike?

2146
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:24,603
Put the fuck.

2147
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,410
What are we going to do with
lists of weeding girl delivered.

2148
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,283
We'd

2149
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,600
like for real.

2150
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:38,110
Like if you wanted to make
money and that's what I
presumed they all want to do.

2151
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:40,840
And the reason why they want to have
brock lesnar fight dc is because they want

2152
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:41,890
to make a shit ton of money,

2153
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,211
right?

2154
00:56:42,211 --> 00:56:42,880
Yeah.

2155
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,540
Nate.

2156
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,820
Mother fucking des.

2157
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,900
You want to make money?

2158
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,810
You call nate mother fucking ds.

2159
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,040
Go party with them.

2160
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,840
Become a good friend.

2161
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,070
Lightened him up.

2162
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,280
give him what he wants.

2163
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:57,700
Give them a lot of money.

2164
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:58,600
that's a good fight.

2165
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,671
We saw it twice.

2166
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:00,970
You know,

2167
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:02,260
it's not just a good fight.

2168
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:07,290
It's a gigantic like fan friendly
spectacle of inexperience.

2169
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,540
Nate diaz doesn't take any bullshit.

2170
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:12,280
You can't trash talk him.

2171
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,480
It doesn't work.

2172
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:13,990
Yeah,

2173
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:14,500
exactly.

2174
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,050
It doesn't work.

2175
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,420
It works the opposite way.

2176
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:18,100
Works the opposite way.

2177
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,490
Like when connor shit talk,

2178
00:57:19,491 --> 00:57:19,811
nate.

2179
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:20,261
Nate was like,

2180
00:57:20,261 --> 00:57:21,190
fuck you.

2181
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:22,170
I was like,

2182
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:22,570
what?

2183
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:23,530
Like it didn't work.

2184
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,460
I ain't gonna lie man.

2185
00:57:24,461 --> 00:57:25,151
One of my favorite.

2186
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:26,890
Nate fights with him and him and cowboy.

2187
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:27,620
Oh,

2188
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,453
that was great fight.

2189
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,920
He got in cowboys head.

2190
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:30,710
He did.

2191
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,200
There was a good lesson for cowboy though.

2192
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:35,320
So important fight for them in terms
of like the path of his career.

2193
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,213
Yeah.

2194
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:36,700
Yeah.

2195
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,720
He grew something from that.

2196
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:38,643
Yeah,

2197
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,041
but that,

2198
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:39,970
that third round,

2199
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,420
nate standing there,

2200
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,250
flipping the bird.

2201
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,260
How good the cowboy
looking against Mike Perry.

2202
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:45,430
holy shit.

2203
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:46,840
It's a new cowboy.

2204
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,311
He looked different.

2205
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:48,730
Man.

2206
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:49,511
Look different.

2207
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:54,010
Just everything looks smooth and
just like a goddamn execution.

2208
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:55,180
I heard rumors of that too.

2209
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:55,880
I heard rumors,

2210
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,130
a cowboy and connor.

2211
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,080
That's a fight that I would make.

2212
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,340
I would make that fight.

2213
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:00,940
That's,

2214
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,510
that's,

2215
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:02,920
that's how fucking exciting fight.

2216
00:58:02,921 --> 00:58:04,540
And that's what also a big sell.

2217
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,280
You could sell the shit out of that fight.

2218
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,713
That's a big fight.

2219
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,640
But,

2220
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,473
but connor,

2221
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,021
excuse me,

2222
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:12,940
cowboys not been fighting at 55,

2223
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:13,341
you know,

2224
00:58:13,341 --> 00:58:15,040
it's been doing majority of his fights.

2225
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,153
Um,

2226
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,400
that's another 165.

2227
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:19,390
Yeah.

2228
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:22,440
How many fights do you fought
til he's fought mosfet.

2229
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,250
All those are all seventies.

2230
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:24,461
You know,

2231
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:25,380
they're all 75.

2232
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:28,383
perry

2233
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,333
was in another one.

2234
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:31,870
Oh yeah,

2235
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:32,310
yeah.

2236
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,143
The John Edwards.

2237
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:33,760
Yeah.

2238
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,870
so that's um,

2239
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:36,820
those are all seventies.

2240
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:37,300
Yeah.

2241
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,210
I don't think he's fought
55 in quite a while now.

2242
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:40,300
You can still make it though.

2243
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:41,740
It's not a big 70.

2244
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,093
Yeah.

2245
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,490
I think he was talking
about going back to 55.

2246
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,100
Say something and you know,

2247
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,190
and If they do have a 65
pound weight class and he can

2248
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,550
see it,

2249
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,300
I just,

2250
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,480
there's a lot of great fights at 65.

2251
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,441
And kevin,

2252
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:00,700
the dude,

2253
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:01,720
anybody in Kevin Lee,

2254
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,160
kevin leaves a beast.

2255
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:03,580
Man,

2256
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,540
he's something special.

2257
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,550
I think kevin was one of those dudes.

2258
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:09,370
You don't see him fight for six months
and then he gets in there and you got a

2259
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:10,870
whole different animal in front of you.

2260
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,460
You've got to go with new skills,

2261
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,720
new momentum,

2262
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,610
new experiences.

2263
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:15,270
Just he gets,

2264
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:16,270
he's just in that,

2265
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,710
I think he's 25 right now.

2266
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,560
He's in that peak prime learning,

2267
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:22,040
growing confidence

2268
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:24,710
part of his career where he's just,

2269
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,450
he's just a monster right now.

2270
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:28,401
I don't know,

2271
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:28,810
man.

2272
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:29,210
Those,

2273
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:32,250
those guys are so much
bigger than than the guy.

2274
00:59:32,251 --> 00:59:33,080
So my day.

2275
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,610
I know that 55.

2276
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:35,120
Yeah,

2277
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,160
kevin's like walks around 190 pounds.

2278
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,740
Big guy and I'm retired.

2279
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:40,701
I'm retired.

2280
00:59:40,701 --> 00:59:42,140
I'm no longer in this.

2281
00:59:42,141 --> 00:59:45,980
I don't worry about my weight as much and
I stand next to these guys and they're

2282
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:47,060
still bigger than me.

2283
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,273
It's like,

2284
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,163
how is that?

2285
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,550
Why Is that we know.

2286
00:59:50,551 --> 00:59:52,190
What's the craziest dc?

2287
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:53,010

the dcs for like five,

And he like,

2293
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:57,920
he could be a middleweight.

2294
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,990
It could be a middleweight

01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:42,710
When is his last name?

2331
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:43,970
He fought tom lawler.

2332
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:46,610
He dc dc is like,

2333
01:00:46,611 --> 01:00:46,731
yeah,

2334
01:00:46,731 --> 01:00:47,720
this guy takes me down.

2335
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:48,500
Um,

2336
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:48,771
yeah,

2337
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:49,640
he's a good wrestler.

2338
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,100
But It's funny because he's
sprawled on tom lawler,

2339
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,060
but he's on his feet.

2340
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,073
He's standing,

2341
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,790
but he's taught a lot is on his knees,

2342
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:57,410
like on his knees upright.

2343
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,250
Wow.

2344
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,690
This kid is sprawl I guess.

2345
01:00:59,691 --> 01:00:59,901
Yeah,

2346
01:00:59,901 --> 01:01:00,734
I guess I'm older than him.

2347
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:01,910
Just get sprawled on his head.

2348
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,833
Yeah.

2349
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:03,380
But he,

2350
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:03,740
he can,

2351
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,760
he can box to when he's literally.

2352
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,070
It looks a little awkward.

2353
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:10,280
He looks like a guy and you're
in a walmart parking lot.

2354
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:13,280
You'd talk shit to him because
he's little fuck you up.

2355
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:16,830
Do you remember dwight mohammed car?

2356
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,320
We know he used to be.

2357
01:01:18,321 --> 01:01:19,280
Dwight braxton.

2358
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,190
He was the Light heavyweight
champion way back in the day,

2359
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:27,191
and then he fought evander holyfield
as a cruiserweight and a car.

2360
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,600
We was one 95.

2361
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:30,950
He was five slash seven.

2362
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:35,750
He was just a tank of a man and
he would come at you like this,

2363
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,100
just real low.

2364
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:40,190
He would get even lower
and he was a tough,

2365
01:01:40,191 --> 01:01:40,941
tough guy,

2366
01:01:40,941 --> 01:01:41,774
man.

2367
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:43,010
And real thick.

2368
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:47,240
Like you didn't see many dudes that were
that thick back then and he would wear

2369
01:01:47,241 --> 01:01:48,860
his trunks way up high.

2370
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,990
So you have like this much body
to hit and it was all just jack.

2371
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:53,930
It's like the strike zone.

2372
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,460
Yeah.

2373
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:54,680
Yeah.

2374
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,670
He's going to get a smaller.

2375
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:58,640
Who's one of the first big
tests for eVander holyfield?

2376
01:01:58,660 --> 01:01:59,060
Yeah.

2377
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,070
Dwight muhammad car wheat from camden,

2378
01:02:01,071 --> 01:02:01,461
New Jersey,

2379
01:02:01,461 --> 01:02:01,911
camden,

2380
01:02:01,911 --> 01:02:02,410
buzzsaw.

2381
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:04,940
That feels like.

2382
01:02:04,941 --> 01:02:05,900
I feel like that.

2383
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,123
I've heard of that,

2384
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:09,050
but I don't remember anything.

2385
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,870
I feel like even holyfield versus kawaii.

2386
01:02:11,871 --> 01:02:12,330
Kawaii.

2387
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,430
You spelled with a q.

2388
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:14,960
You Talk about.

2389
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,240
You talk about that way way I think.

2390
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:17,990
How do you spell call?

2391
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:19,940
We said qa,

2392
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:22,010
qa,

2393
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:22,650
wi.

2394
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:22,831
yeah.

2395
01:02:22,831 --> 01:02:23,664
I found the other guy.

2396
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,061
Darren,

2397
01:02:24,061 --> 01:02:25,370
when you have a cute note,

2398
01:02:25,371 --> 01:02:27,300
you different language.

2399
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:27,691
Yeah.

2400
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:30,190
What is that to aws role?

2401
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:32,930
Q always has a.

2402
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,980
You write in english?

2403
01:02:34,981 --> 01:02:35,360
Yeah.

2404
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,193
Yeah.

2405
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:37,923
Doesn't it?

2406
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:42,590
Let me see what it is that
you start with a q cv.

2407
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,433
Get into that.

2408
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:44,431
Yeah.

2409
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:44,701
See,

2410
01:02:44,701 --> 01:02:45,534
this is.

2411
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:46,980
He would fight real low.

2412
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,990
It was just a tank of a dude.

2413
01:02:48,991 --> 01:02:49,824
Yeah.

2414
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:56,890
And he was like all like bobbing and
weaving and always ducking under punches.

2415
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,170
And this is a vendor holyfield
fresh out of the olympics.

2416
01:02:59,171 --> 01:03:00,580
He had had a few uh,

2417
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:03,100
boxing matches but wasn't.

2418
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,600
Know wasn't.

2419
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,990
It wasn't the evander holyfield that
we think of when he won the heavyweight

2420
01:03:07,991 --> 01:03:08,460
title.

2421
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,680
And this is also before he
started training with mackie
shall stone and mackey

2422
01:03:11,681 --> 01:03:13,330
shields don't put a lot of muscle on them.

2423
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:15,400
Being them a lot bigger.

2424
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,740
He was 195 pounds back then.

2425
01:03:17,741 --> 01:03:19,120
It was like see much thinner is.

2426
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:19,661
Let's see,

2427
01:03:19,661 --> 01:03:21,730
like this is the style of that.

2428
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:22,653
Bob and weave instyle,

2429
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,460
ceo of anders having a
hard time hitting him,

2430
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:26,590
but he,

2431
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:27,131
you move your head,

2432
01:03:27,131 --> 01:03:30,280
protect your body when you're that small
and he was giving you all forehead and

2433
01:03:30,281 --> 01:03:31,770
it was a big old ball for him too,

2434
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,100
so it was just like,

2435
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,800
he's like coming at
you all for head first.

2436
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:40,360
Just a real skillful old school
boxer though in stem socks,

2437
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,010
old school stripes,

2438
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:43,610
stripes on the calf,

2439
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,493
pulled

2440
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,353
all the way up.

2441
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:49,810
I still love watching
these old boxing matches.

2442
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,790
This is something that
really mismanaged that.

2443
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:53,440
Boxing used to be on tv,

2444
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:54,790
wide world of sports,

2445
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,160
you know,

2446
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:56,570
show shown.

2447
01:03:56,570 --> 01:04:00,200
Actually aloma chenko like the best aloma
chanko to last than espn to like it.

2448
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:00,621
Well,

2449
01:04:00,621 --> 01:04:05,621
he fights on espn is doing some
serious world championship fights.

2450
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:07,870
Espn has really stepped up in,

2451
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:10,390
especially now that hbo
has gotten out of the game.

2452
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:11,253
It's.

2453
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:13,030
I mean it's in a precarious situation.

2454
01:04:13,031 --> 01:04:15,490
I don't know why hbo decided
to get out of the boxing game.

2455
01:04:15,491 --> 01:04:16,540
It's kind of crazy to me,

2456
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,140
but after all those years of
covering the greatest fights ever,

2457
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,610
hbo decided to just pull out.

2458
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:24,580
I know that when the guy that
started that or not started it,

2459
01:04:24,581 --> 01:04:27,430
but that guy who's like the
pay per view model creator,

2460
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,620
mark taffet and he,

2461
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,300
he left and I don't know if,

2462
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,050
if that had something to do with it,

2463
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:34,960
I'd imagine it has to be
a profitability thing.

2464
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,550
I think that's the only
thing that makes sense.

2465
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:37,150
Yeah.

2466
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:38,230
It has to be that they just,

2467
01:04:38,231 --> 01:04:39,160
what they were losing money.

2468
01:04:39,161 --> 01:04:39,281
I mean,

2469
01:04:39,281 --> 01:04:40,990
you gotta think the production is huge,

2470
01:04:40,991 --> 01:04:41,201
right?

2471
01:04:41,201 --> 01:04:43,180
You got all these cameras and
all those thing and they're,

2472
01:04:43,181 --> 01:04:44,130
they're alive.

2473
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,910
They got to get the trucks
that production trucks.

2474
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:51,100
It's probably a live sports is probably
an extremely expensive thing to pull

2475
01:04:51,101 --> 01:04:51,934
off,

2476
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:52,410
you know?

2477
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:53,243
Yeah,

2478
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:53,681
yeah.

2479
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:54,514
It makes sense.

2480
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:55,660
But they were the best at it.

2481
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:57,100
Lampley and kellerman.

2482
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:58,900
I mean fucking commentary.

2483
01:04:58,901 --> 01:05:01,480
Roy jones jr doing commentary
with them sometimes.

2484
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:02,403
Andre ward,

2485
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:03,150
you know,

2486
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:05,370
they had some of the best fights ever.

2487
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,430
The best team ever.

2488
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:07,481
I agree.

2489
01:05:07,481 --> 01:05:08,314
Jones jr.

2490
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,430
I loved Roy Jones,

2491
01:05:09,431 --> 01:05:09,750
jr.

2492
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,830
tried to get him in here to shit,

2493
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,360
you know,

2494
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,030
[inaudible].

2495
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:13,541
Do you know what,

2496
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:15,130
what's happening with him that uh,

2497
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,680
michael b dot talking about?

2498
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:18,010
he could

2499
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,940
box Roy Jones.

2500
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,440
I love your reaction.

2501
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:25,180
Yes.

2502
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,013
Yes.

2503
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:26,920
That's funny.

2504
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,753
I love,

2505
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:30,310
I love a cocky,

2506
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,870
like robust young

2507
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,620
man who's delusional.

2508
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:36,380
Yeah.

2509
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:37,710
You got to add that caveat.

2510
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:39,251
I mean,

2511
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:41,410
he's a fucking beast if
you look at his body,

2512
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:41,790
right?

2513
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:42,101
Right.

2514
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:45,820
Michael Jordan is just
jacked full six pack bill.

2515
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:47,020
Like a greek goD.

2516
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,330
But son stop.

2517
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:50,440
It creates a movie.

2518
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,090
It's a movie man.

2519
01:05:52,091 --> 01:05:52,391
I know.

2520
01:05:52,391 --> 01:05:54,010
You felt good hitting those pads.

2521
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:55,011
No,

2522
01:05:55,011 --> 01:05:55,611
you look good.

2523
01:05:55,611 --> 01:05:56,444
Look at him.

2524
01:05:57,350 --> 01:06:00,210
Roy jones jr will light you up like
a christmas tree in times square.

2525
01:06:00,211 --> 01:06:01,280
This rodman in this quarter.

2526
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:02,440
I don't think that's dennis rodman.

2527
01:06:02,441 --> 01:06:03,890
I think it's his brother.

2528
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:08,750
I mean he's jacked for sure.

2529
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:09,381
It looks good,

2530
01:06:09,381 --> 01:06:12,200
but listen to terrible disaster.

2531
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:13,340
Check out my segway.

2532
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:14,540
Like if he thinks he's tough,

2533
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:16,040
he can fight in pfl for me.

2534
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:16,900
And ah.

2535
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:20,180
So what is the deal with pfl
in the million dollar thing?

2536
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:24,610
Like what is it for each
individual weight class on,

2537
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:25,700
on new Year's eve,

2538
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:26,151
there's a,

2539
01:06:26,151 --> 01:06:27,920
there's a $10,000,000 prize pool.

2540
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:29,601
All the winners,

2541
01:06:29,601 --> 01:06:32,870
six winners of their championship
fights get a million dollars.

2542
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,720
So three fights for me.

2543
01:06:34,721 --> 01:06:35,720
Million dollars because it's playoffs.

2544
01:06:35,721 --> 01:06:36,081
Fights,

2545
01:06:36,081 --> 01:06:36,530
right?

2546
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:39,740
The playoffs are cool too though
because once you make the off,

2547
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,240
if you lose in the quarters,

2548
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,260
it's a guaranteed 50.

2549
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,150
You lose in the semis.

2550
01:06:44,151 --> 01:06:44,984
That's 100.

2551
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:46,670
And then the finals are,

2552
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,690
the winner gets a million.

2553
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,180
The loser.

2554
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,870
200 still good.

2555
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,541
Still good money,

2556
01:06:50,541 --> 01:06:50,870
right?

2557
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:51,650
I'm,

2558
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:53,510
I'm happy to see how good vinnie's doing.

2559
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:55,490
Vinny meghalaya beast.

2560
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,440
he's a completely different guy.

2561
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:58,370
You know,

2562
01:06:58,370 --> 01:06:59,800
he always had the,

2563
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:00,770
the,

2564
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:04,190
some of the best jujitsu you're
ever going to see an mma peter.

2565
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:04,790
Yeah.

2566
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:07,100
But then hiS striking wasn't up to par,

2567
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:07,963
but now it is.

2568
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:09,320
His striking was good.

2569
01:07:09,321 --> 01:07:14,321
I mean he won two fights because of his
striking one with strikes and one by

2570
01:07:15,021 --> 01:07:16,190
setting it up with his striking.

2571
01:07:16,191 --> 01:07:16,910
You know,

2572
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:17,500
vinny,

2573
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:17,980
he's,

2574
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,490
he's really working out and he says,

2575
01:07:19,491 --> 01:07:21,860
he says he claims to be training
four times a day for this.

2576
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:22,670
Um,

2577
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:23,000
and he,

2578
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,050
he looked that way,

2579
01:07:24,051 --> 01:07:25,280
he didn't get out of the first round,

2580
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:29,210
like each fight got longer and the
longest flight with like two minutes,

2581
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,630
33 seconds or something like that.

2582
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:31,920
His jujitsu.

2583
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,270
Who's on another level?

2584
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:36,060
Vinny magallanes is one
to just forget about mma.

2585
01:07:36,061 --> 01:07:39,930
He's one of the best in his weight
class on the planet earth in jujitsu.

2586
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,100
I mean he's a monster.

2587
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:43,550
Do you ever see when a
flying arm barred paid upon?

2588
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:43,920
No.

2589
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,460
No dude.

2590
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:46,141
Dude,

2591
01:07:46,141 --> 01:07:46,371
when you,

2592
01:07:46,371 --> 01:07:49,920
you're flying armbar a world
champion like paid upon?

2593
01:07:49,921 --> 01:07:50,380
No,

2594
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:55,380
I mean vinny just they tie up and vinny
just throws his 220 pound body up in the

2595
01:07:56,671 --> 01:07:58,500
air and snatches his arm out of nowhere.

2596
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,860
Flip flips them over on
his back and paid upon,

2597
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:01,351
tapped out.

2598
01:08:01,351 --> 01:08:02,184
And he was like,

2599
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:03,573
if it needs a ninja,

2600
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:04,890
he's a bad motherfucker.

2601
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:06,940
Motherfucker on.

2602
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,353
That's um,

2603
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:12,980
I think that that is the fight that I'm
the second flight that I'm looking to

2604
01:08:12,981 --> 01:08:14,020
the most for the,

2605
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:14,390
for the,

2606
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:15,223
for the finals.

2607
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,250
Then that ray cooper,

2608
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,990
the third dude,

2609
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:18,861
he's another one.

2610
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:19,700
Five slash seven.

2611
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:20,270
Yeah.

2612
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,490
Hay makers vicious.

2613
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,650
Why did they make jake
shields fight that dude again,

2614
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:27,770
this just how it played out.

2615
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:28,491
That's crazy.

2616
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:29,580
The number eight seed right?

2617
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,080
Smashed by by ray and then
he's got to fight him again.

2618
01:08:33,081 --> 01:08:33,670
Yeah,

2619
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:38,630
and it's like he didn't have much
time in between the five months,

2620
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,800
not even five months.

2621
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:40,820
Formula was like,

2622
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:41,451
let me see.

2623
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,150
The first one happened in like july.

2624
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,410
The second was october,

2625
01:08:45,411 --> 01:08:46,220
july,

2626
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:46,551
august,

2627
01:08:46,551 --> 01:08:47,600
september three months.

2628
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:47,900
Yeah.

2629
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,940
How crazy is it that jake fought his dad?

2630
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:54,350
Jake ford is that 14 years ago and then
when they were scheduled to fight the

2631
01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:55,184
first time.

2632
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:56,870
Jake his favorite,

2633
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,970
because we know who jake jake shields is.

2634
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:00,320
We don't know who ray cooper.

2635
01:09:00,321 --> 01:09:05,321
The third is we don't know state champion
wrestler hay makers hits like a truck

2636
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,530
and he's just a tank of a man
and when you see him in there,

2637
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:12,680
he doesn't look as small as like when
I stand next to them and talk to him,

2638
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:13,610
it's like he's a short,

2639
01:09:13,611 --> 01:09:14,444
stocky guy,

2640
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:17,390
but then when he's in
there against jake shields,

2641
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:18,410
he.

2642
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:18,891
I don't know.

2643
01:09:18,891 --> 01:09:19,521
That persona,

2644
01:09:19,521 --> 01:09:20,181
that attitude,

2645
01:09:20,181 --> 01:09:20,991
that personality.

2646
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:24,650
He's coming forward and jake's backing
up and it makes him look bigger than he

2647
01:09:24,651 --> 01:09:25,220
is.

2648
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:25,491
well,

2649
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:26,570
he's only five slash seven,

2650
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:28,020
but jesus fucking christ,

2651
01:09:28,021 --> 01:09:28,854
he hit so hard.

2652
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,660
He's terrifying to any.

2653
01:09:30,661 --> 01:09:35,630
He's crispr technique like it's not
just like throwing wide looping fucking

2654
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,310
ridiculous punches like ricardo,

2655
01:09:37,311 --> 01:09:39,500
my org or some shit that they hit you.

2656
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:40,334
You're fucked.

2657
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:40,701
No,

2658
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:42,500
he's throwing everything
with great technique.

2659
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,330
He's a monster.

2660
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:44,570
I,

2661
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:45,680
I mean he's,

2662
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:46,514
he's,

2663
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:49,080
he's been my biggest favorite this,

2664
01:09:49,081 --> 01:09:49,914
this season.

2665
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:50,840
Like just watching.

2666
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,930
Well he's unquestionably world class and
so it was vinny and that's one of the

2667
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:55,700
more interesting things
about today's climate.

2668
01:09:55,730 --> 01:10:00,730
I feel like with bella tour with
a pfl for absolutely with one fc.

2669
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:05,300
You have world class fighters
in many organizations.

2670
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:09,390
It's not just the ufc and these guys
can all come over and compete and

2671
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:13,280
essentially at the top of the heap
right now and basically you've got lance

2672
01:10:13,281 --> 01:10:14,114
palmer,

2673
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:18,350
these guys in almost every organization
that I feel like I can compete with the

2674
01:10:18,351 --> 01:10:20,330
best in the world in any organization.

2675
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:21,040
It's,

2676
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,610
it's getting pretty even now,

2677
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:24,650
much more so than it was
four or five years ago.

2678
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:25,131
Yeah,

2679
01:10:25,131 --> 01:10:28,250
it's weird though because all of
these things happened in the past.

2680
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:28,821
We had prIde,

2681
01:10:28,821 --> 01:10:29,720
we had strived for us,

2682
01:10:29,721 --> 01:10:29,931
you know,

2683
01:10:29,931 --> 01:10:32,240
the wec and then those
things got absorbed,

2684
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:32,690
right.

2685
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:35,630
And then all the best guys ended
up in the ufc and it's like,

2686
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:37,220
well all the best guys are here now.

2687
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:39,140
And like now these other organizations,

2688
01:10:39,141 --> 01:10:42,590
one was still around in one was
always not a threat but always,

2689
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:44,540
always had quality quality fighters,

2690
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:45,110
you know,

2691
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:46,400
now we know that the one,

2692
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:48,530
there's some really the guys over at one.

2693
01:10:48,531 --> 01:10:50,640
Then we got asked him coming over now,

2694
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:51,570
the pfl starting now,

2695
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,630
like guys like vinny is his career.

2696
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:55,190
Like he's a different guy now.

2697
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:57,010
Like with the fight,

2698
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,530
he can compete with anybody at two.

2699
01:10:58,531 --> 01:10:58,930
Oh five.

2700
01:10:58,930 --> 01:10:59,763
Exactly.

2701
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,630
Like it's a very different
story for a lot of guys,

2702
01:11:02,631 --> 01:11:03,770
but now what happens when,

2703
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:05,870
when these guys in the ufc,

2704
01:11:05,871 --> 01:11:10,871
the number eighth rank heavyweight in the
ufc sees a guy make a million dollars.

2705
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:14,603
I would.

2706
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:15,451
And he's.

2707
01:11:15,451 --> 01:11:16,284
And he's thinking,

2708
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:17,540
fuck that guy up.

2709
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:23,100
I love it.

2710
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:23,640
It's good.

2711
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,450
It's good for everybody.

2712
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:24,810
Yeah,

2713
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,520
competition is great for the sport.

2714
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:27,570
It's great for the athletes,

2715
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:29,910
it's great for the organizations
because the organizations,

2716
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:31,080
whether they like it or not,

2717
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:31,411
it's gonna.

2718
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:32,360
Make them pick up their game,

2719
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:33,540
going to make them step up.

2720
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:34,980
Some people don't like
to pick up the game,

2721
01:11:34,981 --> 01:11:35,290
joe.

2722
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:39,010
Some people like to because they just
like to be comfortable that it's not live.

2723
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:39,660
It's not.

2724
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:40,480
That is not lying.

2725
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,130
It's not piCk up your game.

2726
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:43,570
Then I got.

2727
01:11:43,571 --> 01:11:43,921
I got.

2728
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:44,130
I.

2729
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:48,750
There was something I wanted to show you
that I'm bed reminded me of why I need

2730
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:49,620
to pick up my game.

2731
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:53,820
I was looking through my phone a couple
months ago and I have this video of my

2732
01:11:53,821 --> 01:11:54,151
dad.

2733
01:11:54,151 --> 01:11:55,950
I'm going to show it to
you to turn this down,

2734
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:00,390
but I'm just going to go straight to
the end because that's the coolest part.

2735
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:02,070
Do you want to send it to jamie?

2736
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:02,731
Yeah,

2737
01:12:02,731 --> 01:12:03,564
I can do that.

2738
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:05,610
Can you airdrop it to him?

2739
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,473
I can airdrop.

2740
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:10,290
I love technology for the mac.

2741
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:12,930
I see young jamie's mbp.

2742
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:13,890
That's it.

2743
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:14,723
Bam.

2744
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,123
Here we go.

2745
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:17,551
Jamie,

2746
01:12:17,551 --> 01:12:21,240
what are you going to call yourself when
you hit 50 little wing going to call

2747
01:12:21,241 --> 01:12:22,074
themselves?

2748
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,340
The best answer ever,

2749
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,300
I didn't name myself named you.

2750
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,593
That's true.

2751
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,470
Good point.

2752
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:32,340
But you got to go through,

2753
01:12:32,341 --> 01:12:34,110
you've got to go forward
some through some of it,

2754
01:12:34,111 --> 01:12:34,531
but yeah,

2755
01:12:34,531 --> 01:12:34,740
like,

2756
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,460
lIke,

2757
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,610
just reminded of like some of
the things in my life I would,

2758
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:39,511
I've been kind of.

2759
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:40,230
What are we going to say?

2760
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:40,800
What is this?

2761
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,461
So my dad,

2762
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:42,210
my dad,

2763
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:43,050
das limbo,

2764
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:43,860
right.

2765
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,590
My dad was the baddest limbo
dance on the planet really?

2766
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:47,250
um,

2767
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,690
and he did some crazy,

2768
01:12:48,691 --> 01:12:49,500
crazy stuff.

2769
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,460
You might need to try it again.

2770
01:12:50,461 --> 01:12:51,294
It didn't.

2771
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:52,320
Oh,

2772
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,460
probably when I close my phone.

2773
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:54,753
Okay.

2774
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:55,630
Um,

2775
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:56,463
there we go.

2776
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,420
Waiting for jamie to grab
it and I'll leave it open.

2777
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,440
I'm no,

2778
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:05,730
my dad used to dance in limbo and
I'm limos when you go onto the stick.

2779
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,450
Yes.

2780
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:07,283
Yes.

2781
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,393
And um,

2782
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:09,263
he,

2783
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,710
I don't want to,

2784
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:11,610
I don't want to ruin it.

2785
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:11,940
Right.

2786
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:15,750
But he was the best jokes from like 88,

2787
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,670
like the year before he died.

2788
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:18,580
Wow.

2789
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:19,080
Yeah.

2790
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,390
So like I,

2791
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,110
I don't know,

2792
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:21,430
uh,

2793
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:25,020
it just reminds me of some
of the thing and my family.

2794
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:27,060
Anytime I did something
that I thought was cool,

2795
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:28,200
they would just be like,

2796
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,310
yeah,

2797
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:29,580
like,

2798
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,391
so wait your dad,

2799
01:13:30,391 --> 01:13:33,360
your dad would do that kind of like fuck.

2800
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,880
Like I could never get out of his shadow,

2801
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:37,230
but this is your dad.

2802
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:37,980
That's my dad.

2803
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:38,813
Oh shit.

2804
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,033
Fire.

2805
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:40,890
Yeah.

2806
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:41,161
Damn.

2807
01:13:41,161 --> 01:13:42,480
How the fuck is he doing that?

2808
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:43,680
That is insane,

2809
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,100
dude.

2810
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:46,933
That's insane.

2811
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:47,311
Yeah.

2812
01:13:47,311 --> 01:13:48,630
He did this for like tons of.

2813
01:13:48,631 --> 01:13:49,980
Or you did it from a geeves.

2814
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:51,670
Everybody wanted to see him do this.

2815
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,790
He did it in front of mandela.

2816
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:53,910
Did it in front of the queen.

2817
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:56,070
Don't know if he's going
to go under it there.

2818
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:56,940
Yeah,

2819
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,740
but it gets better than this whole lot.

2820
01:13:58,770 --> 01:13:59,603
Do you eat?

2821
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,830
How the fuck is he doing that?

2822
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:02,910
You don't kind of core strength.

2823
01:14:02,911 --> 01:14:05,160
That takes blown far.

2824
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,800
But this right here now this
is where it gets ridiculous.

2825
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:08,520
This is like,

2826
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,780
I see this and I'm like,

2827
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:10,500
yeah,

2828
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,333
that's my dad.

2829
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,310
Like

2830
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:13,240
he's going to go what?

2831
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,210
So this is on fire folks in this.

2832
01:14:16,211 --> 01:14:17,740
This thing is I'm not bullshitting.

2833
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:20,590
And he's got to flame
and pizzas in his hand

2834
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:23,320
and he's like that.

2835
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:25,030
That mIght be what,

2836
01:14:25,031 --> 01:14:25,541
13,

2837
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,550
14 inches off the ground
and he's going under it.

2838
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:28,750
ThAt's insane.

2839
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:31,090
Any spitting fire while he's doing it?

2840
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:32,883
holy shit.

2841
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:33,820
You weren't joking.

2842
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:34,270
No,

2843
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,500
my dad was a bad ass.

2844
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:36,783
That's crazy.

2845
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,391
How crazy Is it?

2846
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:40,150
Looking at this old vhs footage digitized?

2847
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,400
It's not that long ago,

2848
01:14:42,401 --> 01:14:42,760
man.

2849
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,200
No,

2850
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,400
and that's a different world that,

2851
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:46,343
that,

2852
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,201
that kind of thing.

2853
01:14:47,201 --> 01:14:48,034
My dad kind of,

2854
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:49,910
I mean I was always with.

2855
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:50,920
I used to love being with him,

2856
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:51,131
you know,

2857
01:14:51,131 --> 01:14:52,030
he's like my best friend.

2858
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,040
I remember I was telling my
son this story about him,

2859
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:54,900
so I had this,

2860
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:58,270
this thing with my kid and I'm recording
this conversation with me and my son

2861
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:58,661
and I'm like,

2862
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,190
what would you do if you
could go back in time?

2863
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:01,331
And he's like,

2864
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:01,630
what?

2865
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:01,841
I was like,

2866
01:15:01,841 --> 01:15:03,130
if you had a time machine
you can go anywhere.

2867
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:03,611
Where would you go?

2868
01:15:03,611 --> 01:15:04,420
He's like,

2869
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:04,811
I don't know,

2870
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:05,740
the 19 hundreds.

2871
01:15:05,741 --> 01:15:06,574
And I'm like,

2872
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,970
I grew up in the 1900.

2873
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:08,970
What are you talking about?

2874
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:09,804
Like last week

2875
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,430
and then I told him this story.

2876
01:15:15,431 --> 01:15:15,880
I was like,

2877
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,420
yo mama.

2878
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:16,781
I was little.

2879
01:15:16,781 --> 01:15:17,470
My dad used to,

2880
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:18,910
I used to bring me on stage to do that.

2881
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,040
I was like four or five years old.

2882
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:21,331
No,

2883
01:15:21,331 --> 01:15:22,240
I was like four years old.

2884
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:22,580
I,

2885
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:23,980
he would pick me up and
carried me under the,

2886
01:15:23,981 --> 01:15:24,611
under the bar.

2887
01:15:24,611 --> 01:15:25,120
Right.

2888
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,260
And one time he raised me on stage.

2889
01:15:26,261 --> 01:15:26,501
He's like,

2890
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:27,131
this is my son,

2891
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:27,820
and he presents me,

2892
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:29,440
the spotlight's on me and I'm like shy.

2893
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:29,861
And I'm like,

2894
01:15:29,861 --> 01:15:30,370
oh.

2895
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:31,510
And he just kind of disappointed,

2896
01:15:31,511 --> 01:15:31,731
you know,

2897
01:15:31,731 --> 01:15:33,190
he's really disappointed in me that day.

2898
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:33,990
And then,

2899
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:34,540
um,

2900
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,490
a couple of weeks later
I was with him again.

2901
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,090
He's like,

2902
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:37,451
I was like,

2903
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:37,691
daddy,

2904
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:38,890
can we bring back on stage?

2905
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:40,510
And he brings me on stage and um,

2906
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:42,340
he's about to pick me up and I'm like,

2907
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:45,383
walk away.

2908
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,750
And I go back to my seat.

2909
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,040
And he loved it.

2910
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:48,731
He loved it,

2911
01:15:48,731 --> 01:15:48,971
you know,

2912
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:50,020
and I told my son that story.

2913
01:15:50,021 --> 01:15:50,591
My dad was like,

2914
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:51,430
he people afterwards,

2915
01:15:51,431 --> 01:15:54,060
we walked through the hotel to go back
and he has me on his shoulders and he's

2916
01:15:54,061 --> 01:15:54,581
just so proud.

2917
01:15:54,581 --> 01:15:54,761
He's like,

2918
01:15:54,761 --> 01:15:55,900
you see bible and he's like,

2919
01:15:55,901 --> 01:15:56,560
you know,

2920
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,600
I told my son about that.

2921
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:58,320
My son was like,

2922
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,380
it was like 40 minutes later in the
conversation and my son is like that.

2923
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,650
If I had a time machine I'd go back
and hang out with you and your dad.

2924
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:07,973
That was like,

2925
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,820
that was the best moment of my life.

2926
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:11,620
Yeah.

2927
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:12,580
Because he didn't get to meet him.

2928
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:14,020
But It's one of those things,

2929
01:16:14,021 --> 01:16:14,291
man.

2930
01:16:14,291 --> 01:16:14,981
And just,

2931
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:19,981
just thinking about that kind of thing
I'm kinda makes it inspires me to,

2932
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:22,240
like,

2933
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:22,471
to,

2934
01:16:22,471 --> 01:16:23,580
like want to do things where,

2935
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:24,281
where you know,

2936
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:24,821
kids,

2937
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:26,590
like this is what my dad did that for me.

2938
01:16:26,591 --> 01:16:30,220
And he made me excited about things and
now I want to do stuff where something

2939
01:16:30,221 --> 01:16:31,810
where I can give something to kids.

2940
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:32,580
And um,

2941
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:33,850
just what you're doing with your book.

2942
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:34,991
That's what I'm doing with that.

2943
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:35,151
And,

2944
01:16:35,151 --> 01:16:37,210
and like my thing is mixed martial arts,

2945
01:16:37,211 --> 01:16:37,630
right?

2946
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:38,463
So this thing,

2947
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:40,000
this is the first book,

2948
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:42,160
the talent quest and um,

2949
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,320
so it's about these characters,

2950
01:16:44,321 --> 01:16:44,551
these,

2951
01:16:44,551 --> 01:16:44,770
these,

2952
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:45,603
you write all this.

2953
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,020
So here's the thing,

2954
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,930
the concept and the
characters camera with me,

2955
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:50,450
I have,

2956
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:51,310
I have a good friend,

2957
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:51,700
she's a,

2958
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,860
she's a psychologist,

2959
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:54,763
she's in Australia,

2960
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:59,910
she wrote this story out and then we have
this girl that does the illustration,

2961
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,660
she's mariam,

2962
01:17:01,661 --> 01:17:02,171
she fights,

2963
01:17:02,171 --> 01:17:02,980
she fights with one,

2964
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,020
she's fighting this weekend,

2965
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:04,930
right?

2966
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:06,910
So like it's all,

2967
01:17:06,911 --> 01:17:10,010
It's all about mixed martial arts
and the psychology of and working

2968
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,360
on all these different things.

2969
01:17:11,361 --> 01:17:14,990
But we're going to put this whole
program together that that's all about

2970
01:17:14,991 --> 01:17:16,190
teaching kids like discipline,

2971
01:17:16,191 --> 01:17:17,024
self respect,

2972
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:17,990
self resilience,

2973
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:21,500
all of these things and put these stories
together with these characters and

2974
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,790
it's a whole lot of fun.

2975
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:22,940

2976
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:25,810

Thank you man.

2985
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:31,910
That's awesome.

2986
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:33,470
So is this available for sale?

2987
01:17:33,471 --> 01:17:34,221
Where can people get it?

2988
01:17:34,221 --> 01:17:38,750
So you can get it on amazon
and amazon katen was a ktp.

2989
01:17:38,751 --> 01:17:41,720
I have have to read the thing
in my phone but it's um,

2990
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,820
it will be available.

2991
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:47,350
We were going to release it on
the 15th of December and um,

2992
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,920
you can get it by ebook

2993
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:52,100

2995
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:54,800
It's the 15th of December,

2996
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:55,790
15th of December.

01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:57,050
Remind me and I'll tweet it,

2998

2999
01:17:57,681 --> 01:17:58,550
That'd be so dope.

3000
01:17:59,190 --> 01:17:59,630
um,

3001
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:01,370
when this pfl thing comes out,

3002
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,060
when,

3003
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:03,620
when is this on new year's?

3004
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:04,760
And it's on nbc.

3005
01:18:04,761 --> 01:18:05,750
Nbc sports.

3006
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:07,240
So What channel was that on?

3007
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,930
What does nbc sports on?

3008
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:10,161
Direct tv.

3009
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:11,180
That's one of the weird ones.

3010
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:12,663
You got to find it.

3011
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:13,200
Yeah,

3012
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:13,650
yeah,

3013
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:14,000
yeah.

3014
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,290
You want to watch the olympics,

3015
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:16,130
right?

3016
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:16,820
Is that what it's on?

3017
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:17,421
Nbc sports.

3018
01:18:17,421 --> 01:18:18,041
Nbc sports.

3019
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:19,250
And you want to watch curling?

3020
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,050
Synchronize taekwondo shit.

3021
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:22,420
Yeah.

3022
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:23,253
Talking about.

3023
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:25,370
Know say they're going to do mma.

3024
01:18:25,371 --> 01:18:27,200
They're talking about
doing mma and the olympics.

3025
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:27,481
Yeah,

3026
01:18:27,481 --> 01:18:28,280
I heard about that.

3027
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,810
It's right next to like fs.

3028
01:18:29,811 --> 01:18:31,120
One fs,

3029
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:31,580
one to two.

3030
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,900
Nineteen mbcs.

3031
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:34,190
Sn is 2:20.

3032
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:35,330
So not great in that channel.

3033
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,700
what is nbc?

3034
01:18:37,701 --> 01:18:39,080
Is plans for this,

3035
01:18:39,230 --> 01:18:39,650
for this?

3036
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:40,190
Is this like,

3037
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:43,010
this is obviously they're spending a
lot of money because they're given a

3038
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:45,020
million dollar prize to
three different guys.

3039
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:45,880
You know,

3040
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,950
one of the pfl is its
own organization now,

3041
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:48,491
so it's a,

3042
01:18:48,491 --> 01:18:49,850
it's a partnership with nbc,

3043
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:55,010
so the pfl puts the money up for
the fighters and nbc does have,

3044
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:55,880
does it,

3045
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:56,180
you know,

3046
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:58,100
there's an influx of
money coming in from nbc,

3047
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,290
but the pfl is in control of all of that.

3048
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,230
So I don't know it nbc plans are,

3049
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:03,831
you know,

3050
01:19:03,831 --> 01:19:05,300
but the pfl has big plans.

3051
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:09,170
They have a contract with nbc that I
believe the contract is up this year,

3052
01:19:09,171 --> 01:19:10,970
but of course they're
going to renegotiate,

3053
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:11,600
you know,

3054
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,100
they're going to work things out and
this is the only product that nbc has.

3055
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,150
Mma is hot right now.

3056
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:18,650
So I don't believe nbc wants to,

3057
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,880
wants to let the pfo go.

3058
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:24,800
It's the thing that seems to be the
bottleneck it with other organizations is

3059
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:25,634
the name.

3060
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:27,141
So you know,

3061
01:19:27,141 --> 01:19:28,520
the ufc is like the nfl,

3062
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:28,770
right?

3063
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:29,450
So I got this.

3064
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:30,410
It's the biggest name.

3065
01:19:30,411 --> 01:19:33,080
Ufc has ever made it to a lot
of people to a lot of people.

3066
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,150
And then you hear about the pfl what's,

3067
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:35,870
what's that mean?

3068
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:36,860
What's bella tour mean?

3069
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:37,851
Whereas one fc,

3070
01:19:37,851 --> 01:19:38,684
what does that mean?

3071
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:39,540
it doesn't mean anything.

3072
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:40,070
You're just like,

3073
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:41,270
it's hard to get.

3074
01:19:41,390 --> 01:19:43,730
I think bella tours making some ground,

3075
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:44,270
you know,

3076
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:48,080
because they've been doing plenty of
television events and paramount network is

3077
01:19:48,081 --> 01:19:48,831
a big network.

3078
01:19:48,831 --> 01:19:50,120
a lot of people get the chance to see it.

3079
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:51,590
they've had good ratings,

3080
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:53,630
but it still hasn't caught fire.

3081
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:54,493
Right.

3082
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,060
The thing with the pfl yeah,

3083
01:19:56,061 --> 01:20:00,200
the name professional fighters
league like you hear pfl,

3084
01:20:00,201 --> 01:20:00,951
you don't know what that means.

3085
01:20:00,951 --> 01:20:01,850
You have professional fighters,

3086
01:20:01,851 --> 01:20:02,000
lee,

3087
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,470
you have an idea what's going on,

3088
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:04,190
but um,

3089
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:05,023
it's good name,

3090
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:08,040
it's a great name and it's the name

3091
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,201
is,

3092
01:20:08,201 --> 01:20:09,750
is representative of what it is.

3093
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,350
You know,

3094
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:10,861
it's a league.

3095
01:20:10,861 --> 01:20:11,910
We have a regular season.

3096
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:13,920
So you fight in the regular season,

3097
01:20:13,921 --> 01:20:15,810
you score a certain amount of points,

3098
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,670
you score points by getting finishes,

3099
01:20:17,671 --> 01:20:18,241
you score points.

3100
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:19,350
We're getting finished in the first,

3101
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:19,620
uh,

3102
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:19,891
you know,

3103
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:20,551
you win the fight.

3104
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:22,440
That's three points you
get to finishing the first.

3105
01:20:22,441 --> 01:20:23,520
That's three additional points,

3106
01:20:23,521 --> 01:20:24,091
second round,

3107
01:20:24,091 --> 01:20:24,571
two points,

3108
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:25,470
third now one point.

3109
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:27,720
And then at the end of the regular season,

3110
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:31,530
the top aide seeds get into the
playoffs and you fight by your seed.

3111
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,570
So that's why jake had the fyc fight.

3112
01:20:33,571 --> 01:20:37,890
Ray cooper again is jake kind of edged
into that eight spot and ray cooper was

3113
01:20:37,891 --> 01:20:38,724
the number one

3114
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,550
might want to rework that

3115
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:46,110
to the finished in the third round is
worth less than the finished in the first.

3116
01:20:46,111 --> 01:20:47,190
So don't make any sense to me.

3117
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:47,641
Yeah.

3118
01:20:47,641 --> 01:20:48,450
It's um,

3119
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:50,230
because it's a little tougher
to finishing the third.

3120
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:51,511
Not only that,

3121
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:53,190
it's a finish finishes a finish.

3122
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:53,700
Yeah,

3123
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:53,901
I,

3124
01:20:53,901 --> 01:20:54,734
I,

3125
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:55,820
I agree,

3126
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,400
but I don't

3127
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,710
like sometimes it takes
a while to finish a guy.

3128
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:01,230
Like,

3129
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:01,520
look,

3130
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,630
here's a perfect example.

3131
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:06,920
Say you're fighting a
guy like josh thompson,

3132
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:07,190
you know,

3133
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:10,130
back in the day like
this is a tough fight.

3134
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:14,960
These are two world class fighters versus
you fighting Henry Smith from fucking

3135
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:16,160
albuquerque that nobody knows.

3136
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:18,500
It's different if you finished
that guy in the first round like,

3137
01:21:18,501 --> 01:21:18,681
yeah,

3138
01:21:18,681 --> 01:21:19,940
you've got to finish in the first round,

3139
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:22,670
but did you get to finish
over a world class guy?

3140
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,010
If you've get a finish of a
world class guy in the third,

3141
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,210
that's worth more.

3142
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:29,690
I mean it's depending upon who you're
fighting and what style they are,

3143
01:21:29,691 --> 01:21:30,890
how resilient they are,

3144
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:32,270
how difficult they are to beat,

3145
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,130
but then it gets,

3146
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:38,130
becomes more subjective when
you're talking about the
difficulty and matching up

3147
01:21:38,801 --> 01:21:42,840
styles and then you started to
bring the odds into it from like,

3148
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,780
I guess it wouldn't be betting
odds but similar to betting on.

3149
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:47,763
yeah,

3150
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:53,040
so it's one of those things where there
is no perfect way but you take what you

3151
01:21:54,401 --> 01:21:55,720
have and do the best you can.

3152
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:56,301
I get it,

3153
01:21:56,301 --> 01:21:59,000
but a point the differences in two points,

3154
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:01,160
like you get three points
for the first round,

3155
01:22:01,161 --> 01:22:06,161
but one point if the third phone
call that finishes a finnish man,

3156
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:06,550
you,

3157
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:06,750
you.

3158
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,180
So bonus points for finishes.

3159
01:22:08,230 --> 01:22:10,130
What is a finnish I,

3160
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:11,510
I made that argument.

3161
01:22:11,511 --> 01:22:13,930
We had that conversation is like,

3162
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:15,711
but then again,

3163
01:22:15,711 --> 01:22:16,341
then what do you do?

3164
01:22:16,341 --> 01:22:17,030
How do you get bullied?

3165
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:17,361
What do you get?

3166
01:22:17,361 --> 01:22:18,170
Bonus points for

3167
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:19,340
his perfect example.

3168
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:21,410
How dare you,

3169
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:26,360
how dare you try to diminish
[inaudible] rodriguez last second,

3170
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:29,150
teo of the korean zombie and noticeable.

3171
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:32,360
He shouldn't get all the points for that.

3172
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:33,860
That was crazy.

3173
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:38,780
He literally knocked the guy out with
one second to go with a no look elbow

3174
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,233
pack.

3175
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,320
I mean that's all the points.

3176
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:43,220
Give them all the points.

3177
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,920
That's the git like.

3178
01:22:44,921 --> 01:22:45,131
Yeah.

3179
01:22:45,131 --> 01:22:45,341
Yeah.

3180
01:22:45,341 --> 01:22:45,701
You get,

3181
01:22:45,701 --> 01:22:47,190
you get so many points for finish.

3182
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:47,861
Whether it be first,

3183
01:22:47,861 --> 01:22:49,450
second or third round finishes.

3184
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:51,220
I agree.

3185
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:51,550
Um,

3186
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:52,251
because the,

3187
01:22:52,251 --> 01:22:52,721
the one,

3188
01:22:52,721 --> 01:22:54,670
the one difference that we have is,

3189
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,610
isn't a draw like both guYs get one point.

3190
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,750
I feel that if,

3191
01:22:58,810 --> 01:23:01,630
if you or if it goes to a decision,

3192
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,100
maybe you should get points,

3193
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:04,150
you know,

3194
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:06,460
maybe we should get a point for surviving,

3195
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:09,880
but the winner gets more and then if
you get finished you get no points.

3196
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:12,400
But the finisher gets all the points.

3197
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:14,050
Well it's,

3198
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:15,100
it's definitelY squirrely.

3199
01:23:15,810 --> 01:23:16,690
The idea behind it.

3200
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:17,320
SquIrrelly.

3201
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:18,280
I get what they're doing,

3202
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:20,423
but I don't buy it.

3203
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:20,871
I,

3204
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:21,520
I,

3205
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,121
I buy the,

3206
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:24,760
I buy the fact that you got to get
points because it's kinda like,

3207
01:23:24,761 --> 01:23:26,260
I'm kinda like college wrestling,

3208
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,673
you know,

3209
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:28,930
you get 10 points,

3210
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,670
you get points for a pin,

3211
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:31,980
you get four for the pin,

3212
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:32,730
you get three.

3213
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:33,030
I'm sorry,

3214
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:33,770
you get five for the pen,

3215
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:34,280
you get,

3216
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,550
you get six with I'm so you get
five for the major decision,

3217
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:37,780
you know,

3218
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:39,250
you get three for the decision.

3219
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:39,890
It's,

3220
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:40,780
it's weird.

3221
01:23:40,781 --> 01:23:41,614
But,

3222
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,030
and then maybe tweak next year.

3223
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:47,380
There may be some tweaks for
people to remember all that shit.

3224
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:48,551
That's the thing.

3225
01:23:48,551 --> 01:23:50,160
So we're constantly talking about it on,

3226
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:51,053
on here,

3227
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:51,903
you know,

3228
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:52,270
as,

3229
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:55,210
as the fights going on and people
will listen to her drunk though,

3230
01:23:55,211 --> 01:23:56,300
like what the fuck,

3231
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:59,500
what is the point that can't do the math?

3232
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:00,860
And once there was no,

3233
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:03,050
but it's,

3234
01:24:03,051 --> 01:24:03,280
it's,

3235
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:08,110
it's super cool because it changes
sometimes guys' attitudes when they're in

3236
01:24:08,111 --> 01:24:08,340
there,

3237
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:11,650
they changes what they do and
how they respond in the fight.

3238
01:24:11,651 --> 01:24:12,484
You know,

3239
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:16,300
say the fight there was a fight
with kyLe allen carr and mike kyle,

3240
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:16,870
right?

3241
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:19,780
Both of these guys needed to
finish to get into the playoffs.

3242
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,190
Either one of those guys get to finish.

3243
01:24:21,191 --> 01:24:22,120
They get into the playoffs.

3244
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:25,470
Josh copeland sitting at home
hoping that nobody gets a finished.

3245
01:24:25,471 --> 01:24:27,180
The fight starts and boom,

3246
01:24:27,181 --> 01:24:30,610
my cow rocks weiland car and it's like
it looks like he's going to get a first

3247
01:24:30,611 --> 01:24:31,061
round finish,

3248
01:24:31,061 --> 01:24:32,050
make it into the playoffs.

3249
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,580
Kyle and guard starts coming back.

3250
01:24:33,581 --> 01:24:36,850
He gets on top and the second round he
looks like he's going to get the finish

3251
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:37,870
and make it to the playoffs.

3252
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:39,070
These guys go to the third.

3253
01:24:39,071 --> 01:24:40,210
Both guys a gas now.

3254
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,290
Nobody finishes.

3255
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:45,730
josh copeland jumps off his chair at
home and he's in the playoffs now and now

3256
01:24:45,731 --> 01:24:46,780
he's in the finals.

3257
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:48,000
Like he was the ac.

3258
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:51,790
He beat the number one seed and then
he beat the number five seat by kale.

3259
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:52,900
Now he's in the.

3260
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:55,470
He's in the finals and he has a chance
to make a million dollars number.

3261
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,500
Ac is going in.

3262
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:57,663
InTeresting.

3263
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:58,060
Okay.

3264
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,470
That you just made a good argument for it.

3265
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,230
I'm not sure if I bought it though.

3266
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:03,481
You buy it,

3267
01:25:03,481 --> 01:25:04,210
joe,

3268
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:05,020
you buy it.

3269
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:06,940
Why don't they revamped
the scoring system?

3270
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:12,820
I would not be surprised if
this off season we do some,

3271
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:13,654
some,

3272
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:16,010
some brainstorming and,

3273
01:25:16,011 --> 01:25:17,590
and change a few things,

3274
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:21,070
but I don't know if a whole
lot is going to be changed.

3275
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:21,820
Um,

3276
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:24,100
I think a few things
will be changed in next.

3277
01:25:24,101 --> 01:25:25,510
Season's going to be even better.

3278
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,670
And to a man,

3279
01:25:27,671 --> 01:25:28,031
I've heard,

3280
01:25:28,031 --> 01:25:30,820
I've heard virtually every high level guy,

3281
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:33,010
every ufc level guy that I've spoken to,

3282
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:34,473
they've said to me,

3283
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:38,650
I think going to be able to pay that
million dollars when they see that million

3284
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:39,483
dollars is real.

3285
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,890
Then I want to see the reaction to that.

3286
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,570
That's gonna change everything.

3287
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:45,680
Once people get that million dollar check,

3288
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:48,080
once you see someone you know,

3289
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,750
you see vinny magallanes driving
around in a ferrari or a rolls royce.

3290
01:25:51,751 --> 01:25:52,584
What the fuck?

3291
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:53,680
Look at that motherfucker.

3292
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:56,500
I kicked his ass and a rolls royce.

3293
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:57,363
I know.

3294
01:25:57,490 --> 01:25:58,323
Yeah,

3295
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,670
you can ask ryan bader
sitting around going,

3296
01:26:00,671 --> 01:26:02,950
what the fuck?

3297
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:03,861
Excuse me.

3298
01:26:03,861 --> 01:26:04,400
Matt.

3299
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,010
Ryan betas.

3300
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:06,230
Another guy who's transformed,

3301
01:26:06,231 --> 01:26:06,650
right?

3302
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:06,950
Yeah.

3303
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:08,630
He's like a legit heavyweight contender.

3304
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:10,460
Now he looks fucking good,

3305
01:26:10,461 --> 01:26:11,210
man.

3306
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:13,640
The way beat mitrione jesus christ.

3307
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,740
And mitch elon has improved.

3308
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,360
She owns improved a lot,

3309
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:17,871
knocked out,

3310
01:26:17,871 --> 01:26:18,704
fade door.

3311
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,430
I mean,

3312
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:19,970
come on,

3313
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:20,803
that's a,

3314
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:21,441
I mean,

3315
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:23,420
that's a feather in your cap
for the rest of your life.

3316
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:23,960
Shoot.

3317
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:26,840
I sat next to fatal and
that's a feather in my cap.

3318
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:27,971
I know,

3319
01:26:27,971 --> 01:26:28,804
right?

3320
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:33,010
I was gonna go to watch the faders,

3321
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:33,711
faders,

3322
01:26:33,711 --> 01:26:34,220
fighting.

3323
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:34,400
Uh,

3324
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,290
ryan bader in la.

3325
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:37,610
They're fighting at the forum,

3326
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,090
but there's a,

3327
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:41,450
there's a ufc that night I can't go.

3328
01:26:41,451 --> 01:26:43,340
I wanted to go see fate or fight live.

3329
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:44,350
Yeah.

3330
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:45,200
Never seen him fight live.

3331
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:47,630
And I felt like that was a
great fight in him versus bader.

3332
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,021
Right.

3333
01:26:48,021 --> 01:26:49,310
That's a great fight to see live.

3334
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,541
I've never,

3335
01:26:50,541 --> 01:26:52,160
I've never seen him fight live either.

3336
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:55,410
I have a picture of me
fader and tim crater like,

3337
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,560
like just tim was fighting and fado is
given me some advice on what to tell.

3338
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:00,950
Tim,

3339
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:01,783
what was he saying?

3340
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:03,590
He was just,

3341
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:04,130
he's just,

3342
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:07,070
he's got to stay low and keep him
away because he was fighting shale.

3343
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:07,460
Right.

3344
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,450
But this was before jail
is jail and he's like,

3345
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:09,770
he's,

3346
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:10,130
he's,

3347
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:12,830
he's wrestler like and
somebody translating it to.

3348
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:13,963
But um,

3349
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:14,751
he's talking to me,

3350
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:15,171
he's talking to,

3351
01:27:15,171 --> 01:27:16,640
he's talking to me and someone
comes along and translate.

3352
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:16,941
He's like,

3353
01:27:16,941 --> 01:27:18,780
he's got to stay low
and keep them outside.

3354
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:19,663
Keep him outside.

3355
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,470
The guy translating sounds like this.

3356
01:27:21,471 --> 01:27:22,060
He said he's,

3357
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:22,581
he says,

3358
01:27:22,581 --> 01:27:25,460
he said fado say keep
him outside and stay low.

3359
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:27,651
But just,

3360
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:31,040
just having a conversation with that dude
and sit next to him and he's not that

3361
01:27:31,041 --> 01:27:33,530
big of a guy is not that big of a guy.

3362
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:35,270
So it was another guy who
probably could be a middleweight.

3363
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,163
Yeah,

3364
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,520
fado is awesome though.

3365
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:40,790
I mean if you see some of the
middle weights that are in the ufc,

3366
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:41,624
like ul,

3367
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:46,290
ul was in your chair sitting right there
and it looked like somebody dropped a,

3368
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:50,170
a giant iron sculpture of
a superhero and put it.

3369
01:27:50,171 --> 01:27:52,280
It doesn't even look like he
doesn't look like a human.

3370
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:53,990
He's so big dude.

3371
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:58,310
He's like 2:20 plus just
jacked everything neck,

3372
01:27:58,311 --> 01:27:59,510
shoulders back,

3373
01:27:59,511 --> 01:28:00,470
just jacked.

3374
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:01,190
You're like,

3375
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:02,540
that is a heavyweight.

3376
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,200
Yeah.

3377
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:03,441
You know,

3378
01:28:03,441 --> 01:28:07,220
if you sit him next to fate or he looks
relaxed bigger way bigger than fader,

3379
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:09,170
yet he fights a one 85,

3380
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,870
but he's also so jacked and
ripped and he's like my age.

3381
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,353
It's incredible.

3382
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:14,780
But he's not like.

3383
01:28:14,781 --> 01:28:15,440
He like,

3384
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,500
you can be my age and be ripped
like I am if I take off my shirt,

3385
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:19,310
but I want to bash you.

3386
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:19,491
Right.

3387
01:28:19,491 --> 01:28:20,360
Don't please don't.

3388
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:20,780
Thank you.

3389
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:23,240
But like the way he is,

3390
01:28:23,241 --> 01:28:25,010
he's ripped like a 25 year old.

3391
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,210
He's ripped like a bodybuilder.

3392
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,323
Yeah.

3393
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:28,670
He's a freak of all freaks.

3394
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:29,540
Yeah.

3395
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:32,300
Like he like you see his
body in the ring and you go,

3396
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:32,961
first of all,

3397
01:28:32,961 --> 01:28:33,890
how did he make weight?

3398
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:35,210
That's what I always think.

3399
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,010
Like when even when he steps on the scale,

3400
01:28:37,011 --> 01:28:39,040
like back before we had the early wayans,

3401
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:41,690
we had the weigh ins at
the actual time of 4:00,

3402
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,190
he would step on the
scale and make weight,

3403
01:28:43,191 --> 01:28:43,321
you know,

3404
01:28:43,321 --> 01:28:45,440
like how is that 185 pounds?

3405
01:28:45,441 --> 01:28:46,520
It doesn't even make sense.

3406
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:49,280
He looks like he's 200
pounds easy plus that,

3407
01:28:49,281 --> 01:28:50,650
that same thing happened in,

3408
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,800
in the match with um,

3409
01:28:51,801 --> 01:28:54,560
conor and floyd when connor
was getting on the scale.

3410
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:55,833
Um,

3411
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:58,730
mayweather's maybe this promoter was like,

3412
01:28:58,820 --> 01:28:59,780
he's not going to make the weight.

3413
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:00,710
He's not gonna make the weIght,

3414
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:02,450
but I don't know this.

3415
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,450
There's some guys who,

3416
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:03,810
you know,

3417
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:05,670
especially the mma guys
are bigger than boxers,

3418
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:06,780
you know,

3419
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:09,450
so it's one of those things
like joelle has that down.

3420
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:09,631
He's,

3421
01:29:09,631 --> 01:29:09,901
he's,

3422
01:29:09,901 --> 01:29:10,920
he is huge,

3423
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,070
but at dehydration hits and
that's probably why he sucks.

3424
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,420
Lockhart talked about it.

3425
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:19,010
Look at the size of that
guys like 42 years old.

3426
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:25,050
He's so jacked and unparalleled
wrestling skills to,

3427
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,281
oh shit.

3428
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:28,440
Yoel romero versus david branches booked.

3429
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:30,060
What does that click on?

3430
01:29:30,061 --> 01:29:30,520
That shit.

3431
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,010
That might not be.

3432
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:31,480
This is.

3433
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:32,370
Could be older.

3434
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,330
It might be new though.

3435
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:34,210
I'll click on it.

3436
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:34,770
Shit,

3437
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:35,603
what do we got?

3438
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:36,533
What are those?

3439
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:38,100
Ufc on fox.

3440
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:38,600
Oh yes,

3441
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:38,870
yes.

3442
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:39,703
Old.

3443
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:40,740
So that never happened,

3444
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:42,690
right?

3445
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:43,410
Doesn't ever happen.

3446
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:44,490
I don't remember it happening.

3447
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:45,423
It didn't happen.

3448
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:46,740
Hmm.

3449
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:51,740
Typed in real elvers fader and there's
a picture of the matching up 3,485 pound

3450
01:29:52,051 --> 01:29:56,070
division is kind of crazy because
they're promising if style bender fights

3451
01:29:56,071 --> 01:29:56,521
anderson,

3452
01:29:56,521 --> 01:29:57,600
they're saying to anderson,

3453
01:29:57,601 --> 01:29:58,291
if you win,

3454
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:01,740
you get a title shot and
everybody else in divisions.

3455
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:02,573
Like what,

3456
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,133
what?

3457
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:08,370
Like you think that that's like some
trickery to get anderson to fight style

3458
01:30:08,371 --> 01:30:08,940
bender?

3459
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:09,390
I,

3460
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:10,830
that's exactly what I think it is.

3461
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:12,960
That's exactly what I think I um,

3462
01:30:13,070 --> 01:30:15,840
does it they offer style bender
title shot if he beats anderson.

3463
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:17,453
Dan hook is,

3464
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:18,240
I don't believe so.

3465
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,910
And that a dad hooker
hooker posted that on it,

3466
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:21,391
on his,

3467
01:30:21,391 --> 01:30:22,260
on his instagram.

3468
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:22,971
And I,

3469
01:30:22,971 --> 01:30:23,610
I like,

3470
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:25,280
I like hooker and I just
had to say something.

3471
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:25,861
I was just like,

3472
01:30:25,861 --> 01:30:26,101
look,

3473
01:30:26,101 --> 01:30:27,810
we know that style.

3474
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:31,170
And my thought was we know when style
benton wins his fight because I really

3475
01:30:31,171 --> 01:30:33,120
believe that I wasn't
going to win that fight.

3476
01:30:33,121 --> 01:30:34,020
When he wins this fight,

3477
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:35,520
he's not going to get that title shot.

3478
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:36,810
And I,

3479
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:41,340
for me as a form of fighter and knowing
who addison is and what he's done for

3480
01:30:41,341 --> 01:30:42,690
the sport and for the ufc,

3481
01:30:42,691 --> 01:30:43,320
I'm just like,

3482
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,153
I feel like that's,

3483
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:44,790
that's,

3484
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:45,080
that's,

3485
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:47,850
that's so disrespectful.

3486
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:48,910
She asked me,

3487
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:49,500
um,

3488
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,400
that's mY opinion.

3489
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:51,121
It's an opinion.

3490
01:30:51,121 --> 01:30:51,760
It's mine.

3491
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,280
And I stand by that,

3492
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,114
that,

3493
01:30:54,170 --> 01:30:54,481
you know,

3494
01:30:54,481 --> 01:30:57,530
we want to make this young
guy star and we're going to,

3495
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:00,090
we're goIng to sacrifice you
to the wolf to get that done.

3496
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:04,020
But anderson still feels like he
can compete at the highest level.

3497
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:08,520
We all go to feel like we could beat it
if you put enough money in front of me,

3498
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:09,563
I will,

3499
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:11,590
I will fuck khabib up.

3500
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:16,950
You put something in front
of me that I really want.

3501
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,330
I'm like,

3502
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:18,960
that's the thing,

3503
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,010
they give you a goal,

3504
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:23,070
give you a time period to
train and prepare for it.

3505
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:24,240
Yeah.

3506
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:24,631
Anderson's,

3507
01:31:24,631 --> 01:31:24,811
what,

3508
01:31:24,811 --> 01:31:25,644
43 now.

3509
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,033
Yeah.

3510
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:27,990
So,

3511
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:28,441
so that's,

3512
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:28,960
that's the thing,

3513
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:33,090
out of the realm of possibilities
the same age as well or close to it.

3514
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:34,973
Yeah.

3515
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:36,600
At least 40 years at least.

3516
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:37,040
Yeah,

3517
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,700
he's 41.

3518
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:40,141
I mean,

3519
01:31:40,141 --> 01:31:40,974
it's not

3520
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,290
the problem within.

3521
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,153
I mean,

3522
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:44,761
anderson,

3523
01:31:44,761 --> 01:31:47,540
we started failing drug tests like okay,

3524
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:50,160
so he's probably struggling
trying to get that edge,

3525
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:51,030
you know,

3526
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:51,540
trying to,

3527
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:52,800
trying to recover and training.

3528
01:31:52,801 --> 01:31:54,600
So he's taking a bunch
of weird supplements.

3529
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:59,750
Some of them are tainted and I
bet you if you go back to just

3530
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,600
go back to what you used to do,

3531
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:06,070
go back to what it was you did when
you became the anniston silver that

3532
01:32:06,071 --> 01:32:06,940
everybody loves,

3533
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:08,043
you know,

3534
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:08,920
before,

3535
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:12,400
before he got to the point where like
before the forrest griffin fight,

3536
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:15,520
because I believe that's when
it started to decline for him.

3537
01:32:15,521 --> 01:32:15,701
Yeah.

3538
01:32:15,701 --> 01:32:16,880
He still looked good and he still,

3539
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:18,040
it still performed well,

3540
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:19,630
but he got away from,

3541
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:21,160
from the fundamentals,

3542
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,200
you know,

3543
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:22,430
um,

3544
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:23,470
and that forrest griffin fight,

3545
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:27,340
he was able to take for us out without
the fundamentals moving his head doing,

3546
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:28,180
doing these weird things,

3547
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:30,760
just popping back fundamentals.

3548
01:32:31,010 --> 01:32:32,470
What's the strongest thing in the game

3549
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:33,321
for sure.

3550
01:32:33,321 --> 01:32:34,070
That fundamental.

3551
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:35,320
The forrest griffin fights it.

3552
01:32:35,321 --> 01:32:36,560
An interesting example too though,

3553
01:32:36,561 --> 01:32:40,700
because forest had been kao
twice in training for that fight,

3554
01:32:40,850 --> 01:32:42,950
but he had no business being in there.

3555
01:32:43,370 --> 01:32:43,791
They really.

3556
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:45,350
And he just couldn't take shot,

3557
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,770
which is another thing I
want to talk to you about.

3558
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:49,281
Tito.

3559
01:32:49,281 --> 01:32:50,114
Chuck,

3560
01:32:51,620 --> 01:32:53,510
as a guy who's retired,

3561
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:57,920
who had an awesome career and you're
watching that and you've seen a guy come

3562
01:32:57,921 --> 01:33:00,590
back at 50 and get stopped like that.

3563
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:01,060
What does.

3564
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:01,970
What did that do for you?

3565
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:04,220
You kind of knew That.

3566
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:05,060
Well,

3567
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:07,370
I felt that chuck shouldn't be
taking that fight right now.

3568
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,750
Tito's been competing.

3569
01:33:08,751 --> 01:33:11,810
Tito's still in there and
then when they stepped in,

3570
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:13,070
as soon as they touched up,

3571
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:13,821
it's like,

3572
01:33:13,821 --> 01:33:14,270
yeah,

3573
01:33:14,270 --> 01:33:15,140
chuck shouldn't be in here.

3574
01:33:15,141 --> 01:33:17,840
He looked does the first time he
looked that much smaller than tito.

3575
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,060
He didn't look the same size of the tito.

3576
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,650
He didn't look comfortable.

3577
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:23,210
He didn't look as coordinated.

3578
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:26,360
Like chuck was always little
quirky and awkward in his movement,

3579
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:28,760
but he didn't even look
like chuck liddell.

3580
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,950
He looked like a shell of chocolate dell.

3581
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:34,150
And if you see him hitting the pads,

3582
01:33:34,151 --> 01:33:35,980
like recent video of him hitting the pads,

3583
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:37,570
did it look terrible?

3584
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,080
Yeah.

3585
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,680
He said he was just warming up like
he had talked to brendan about it.

3586
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:40,961
He says,

3587
01:33:40,961 --> 01:33:42,390
I always look bad when I'm warming up.

3588
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:43,000
I'm like,

3589
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,320
it's not just the look.

3590
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:47,690
It looked like his balance was off work.

3591
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:48,580
I,

3592
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:49,220
I get that.

3593
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:49,380
I,

3594
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:52,250
I would see if I would've
saw that beforehand.

3595
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:56,390
I still wouldn't put a whole lot of stock
in that because like I remember being

3596
01:33:56,391 --> 01:34:00,620
a lock on 44 at hermes frank for the
first time in the ufc and nick diaz was in

3597
01:34:00,621 --> 01:34:05,130
our locker room and niggas hitting pads
and he's about to fight robby and he

3598
01:34:05,131 --> 01:34:06,110
didn't pads and he's like,

3599
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:06,890
yeah,

3600
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:08,300
I'm gonna knock this motherfucker out.

3601
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:09,020
Yeah.

3602
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:11,280
And I'm like not really
hitting those pads.

3603
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:12,050
Like he didn't,

3604
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:13,580
he didn't look like he didn't look sharp,

3605
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:14,630
he didn't look like getting poWer.

3606
01:34:14,770 --> 01:34:15,411
And then you went out there,

3607
01:34:15,411 --> 01:34:16,250
knocked ravi out.

3608
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,380
It was just warming up though,

3609
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:19,010
right?

3610
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:21,080
like sometimes when guys warming up,

3611
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:22,350
they'll just do just,

3612
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,720
they're just trying to get their bodies.

3613
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:24,350
Yeah.

3614
01:34:24,350 --> 01:34:27,560
They're not really trying to look like
a fight or trying to look like sharp.

3615
01:34:27,561 --> 01:34:31,010
Like they're going to be inside
the inside of the cage and yeah,

3616
01:34:31,011 --> 01:34:34,030
he just wanted to see if he
could find that chuck chocolate,

3617
01:34:34,031 --> 01:34:35,000
dell hidden pads.

3618
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:36,133
It's different.

3619
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:37,880
It's different because it's like it.

3620
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:39,230
His balance looks off,

3621
01:34:39,231 --> 01:34:40,700
his coordination looks off.

3622
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:41,990
It just doesn't look.

3623
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,270
It doesn't look good.

3624
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:45,620
You know?

3625
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,453
It just.

3626
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:47,413
There's a.

3627
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:48,613
Here it is.

3628
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:49,483
Take a look at this.

3629
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:50,533
Marsh says,

3630
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:57,703
yeah.

3631
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:01,353
Yeah.

3632
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:02,990
Looks like it has no pop.

3633
01:35:02,991 --> 01:35:03,440
Yeah.

3634
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,080
Yeah.

3635
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,720
I mean it's crazy to watch.

3636
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:06,554
Right?

3637
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,670
It just looks like lucy,

3638
01:35:09,690 --> 01:35:12,740
How he throws that kick in
and leans back afterwards.

3639
01:35:12,741 --> 01:35:17,741
It just looks like there's a real issue
with someone who's had that many chaos.

3640
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:19,850
You've been caled that many times,

3641
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,670
like your brain's been
scrambled that many times.

3642
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,410
Like what is,

3643
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:25,363
how is the,

3644
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:30,370
the connection between your muscles in
your mind which bumps nor neurologic.

3645
01:35:30,481 --> 01:35:30,681
Yeah.

3646
01:35:30,681 --> 01:35:31,880
It makes you uncomfortable,

3647
01:35:31,881 --> 01:35:32,031
right?

3648
01:35:32,031 --> 01:35:32,241
Yeah.

3649
01:35:32,241 --> 01:35:32,780
It does.

3650
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:33,613
Like,

3651
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:33,971
I mean,

3652
01:35:33,971 --> 01:35:34,804
and that's chuck.

3653
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:35,300
Yeah.

3654
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:37,040
I mean one of the greatest of all time.

3655
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:38,590
I don't know.

3656
01:35:38,590 --> 01:35:41,780
I don't and I 49 also 50.

3657
01:35:41,781 --> 01:35:42,080
That's,

3658
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,730
that's there's a point.

3659
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:44,200
Yeah.

3660
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:44,720
You know,

3661
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,510
I almost feel like I
would do it again for,

3662
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:48,890
for certain.

3663
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:50,510
I'm not trying to be a world champion,

3664
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:52,820
I'm not trying to get to qbb
or dustin and those guys,

3665
01:35:52,821 --> 01:35:53,200
you know,

3666
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:53,660
um,

3667
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:57,200
but like Joe lowe's on diego sanchez,

3668
01:35:57,201 --> 01:35:59,030
somebody that's like from the same era,

3669
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:00,980
at least the part of
the era that I was in,

3670
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:02,091
somebody like that,

3671
01:36:02,091 --> 01:36:02,391
you know,

3672
01:36:02,391 --> 01:36:05,600
somebody who have respect for and it
like it's going to be fun and some,

3673
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:06,770
but like I'm not.

3674
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:09,690
And I guess that's what tito
and chuck is also chuck,

3675
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:10,550
he beat him twice.

3676
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:11,120
Yeah.

3677
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:11,460
You know,

3678
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:13,010
let's be inventories by knockout.

3679
01:36:13,011 --> 01:36:13,844
But the,

3680
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:16,610
I think he just felt like
you always had tito's number,

3681
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:19,070
but this is the problem
is like tito winds now,

3682
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:19,820
right?

3683
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:22,580
Like the guy who he never
wanted to win now wins.

3684
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:24,710
THe guy who wouldn't fight
him when he was tHe champ.

3685
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:25,900
now that was the winter,

3686
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:29,390
like when it all said
and done tito k odom.

3687
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:33,620
And he kIlled him more soundly
than chuck evekeo tito.

3688
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:35,300
Because when chuck hailed tito,

3689
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:38,210
he basically beat him down
and then tito covered up.

3690
01:36:38,211 --> 01:36:39,140
But he was conscious,

3691
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:39,720
right?

3692
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:40,670
Like right.

3693
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,620
Chuck chuck out,

3694
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:45,130
he put them out and you know,

3695
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:45,591
I mean,

3696
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:47,120
it was a good shot for sure,

3697
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:50,330
but it just seems like you're
dealing with a guy whose,

3698
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:51,290
whose brains are,

3699
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:51,911
you know,

3700
01:36:51,911 --> 01:36:52,280
it's just,

3701
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,990
he's been scrambled too many times.

3702
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:55,603
YeaH.

3703
01:36:56,530 --> 01:36:56,900
Yeah.

3704
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:57,351
Prizes.

3705
01:36:57,351 --> 01:36:58,184
They made that fight.

3706
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:01,550
I am surprised that the commission
that the fight happened.

3707
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:02,151
Yes.

3708
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:02,901
If that's what you mean.

3709
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:03,290
Yeah.

3710
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:05,900
I'm not surprised that
that oscar de la hoya,

3711
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:08,270
tito ortiz came together and said,

3712
01:37:08,271 --> 01:37:09,440
let's get chuck to fight me.

3713
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:10,281
You know,

3714
01:37:10,281 --> 01:37:11,750
I'm not surprised about that at all.

3715
01:37:12,930 --> 01:37:15,620
Do you know that they said there
was only like 25,000 pay per view.

3716
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:16,460
But that's what I heard.

3717
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:17,621
I kinda sucks.

3718
01:37:17,621 --> 01:37:18,500
So it's crazy.

3719
01:37:18,501 --> 01:37:19,160
horrible.

3720
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,120
That's so low.

3721
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,860
That must have cost everybody money.

3722
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:26,920
LIke I have more instagram followers
and it's a hard sell and the undercard

3723
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:28,460
wasn't so good either.

3724
01:37:28,461 --> 01:37:31,510
It wasn't like there was a lot of like
big names on the undercard that's gonna

3725
01:37:31,530 --> 01:37:33,020
draw people in where they're going to go,

3726
01:37:33,021 --> 01:37:34,760
well it's going to Be great
fights no matter what.

3727
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:35,810
no.

3728
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:36,330
Yeah.

3729
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:36,610
The,

3730
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:36,820
the,

3731
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:39,920
the undercard was not that great.

3732
01:37:40,010 --> 01:37:40,380
No,

3733
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:40,880
no.

3734
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:41,400
You know,

3735
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,500
you saw the whole show.

3736
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:43,800
No you didn't.

3737
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:45,890
You didn't know who their windows.

3738
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:47,390
But the,

3739
01:37:47,391 --> 01:37:48,224
um,

3740
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,420
the undercard was not great.

3741
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:51,230
Um,

3742
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:52,460
and then the tito chuck fight,

3743
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,430
chuck tito looks the,

3744
01:37:55,540 --> 01:37:55,860
the,

3745
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:56,030
the

3746
01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:58,980
much better strike a much more
accomplished striker in that fight.

3747
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,260
And tito ortiz knocked out,

3748
01:38:01,261 --> 01:38:02,071
knocked out cHocolate.

3749
01:38:02,071 --> 01:38:02,581
Dell is that,

3750
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:06,060
that's like a phrase I never thought
I would hear and it'd be real,

3751
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:11,070
but isn't it also the case of not just
see tito remaining active and staying

3752
01:38:11,071 --> 01:38:12,630
competitive and exactly what it is.

3753
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:13,500
It's that too,

3754
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:15,210
but it's also a tito skills got better.

3755
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:15,660
Yeah,

3756
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:16,493
they definitely got better.

3757
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,270
Jason pearls and awesome instructor.

3758
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:22,950
I mean he's a fantastic boxing coach and
he really tightened up tito's hands and

3759
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:25,890
all these techniques over over the course
of the years they were together and

3760
01:38:25,891 --> 01:38:27,450
the last time tito and chuck fought,

3761
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:29,190
I phones hadn't been invented.

3762
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:30,750
Yeah.

3763
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:31,583
Think of that shit.

3764
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:32,810
You know?

3765
01:38:32,810 --> 01:38:33,720
No iphones.

3766
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:35,540
People using sidekicks.

3767
01:38:35,550 --> 01:38:36,383
Remember those,

3768
01:38:36,530 --> 01:38:36,890
you know,

3769
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:37,723
where those things.

3770
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:43,020
I remember that flip up the keyboard
and everybody thought they were slick.

3771
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:44,310
Yeah.

3772
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:47,370
That was the last time they fought
to different and myspace was a thing.

3773
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,750
It was a different world man.

3774
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:50,153
It's just um,

3775
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:53,400
it's just sad to see it go down like that.

3776
01:38:53,401 --> 01:38:53,900
Where,

3777
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:57,000
I mean it would be one thing
if it was a good fight.

3778
01:38:57,001 --> 01:38:58,750
If tito looked like chuck chuck,

3779
01:38:59,040 --> 01:38:59,490
tito,

3780
01:38:59,490 --> 01:38:59,731
tito,

3781
01:38:59,731 --> 01:39:00,564
look good.

3782
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:01,680
Chuck did not look good.

3783
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:01,950
Right?

3784
01:39:01,950 --> 01:39:04,140
They both look good and they
put on their best fight.

3785
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,720
And then tito won up winning good for him.

3786
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:07,980
But it wasn't that.

3787
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:09,480
It was one guy was a,

3788
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:12,360
just a shell shell of himself.

3789
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:17,790
So what kind of fight for tito or
rematch fatina would make sense to,

3790
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,790
to that you think would sell?

3791
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:21,151
Is there.

3792
01:39:21,151 --> 01:39:21,984
Is there one?

3793
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,690
Tito versus jail will sell a little bit.

3794
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,390
I mean he's been calling chill out
saying I want to kick your ass,

3795
01:39:27,391 --> 01:39:30,720
but I think that was probably before the
pay per view numbers came in and then

3796
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:32,320
they'll like oscar tails.

3797
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:32,941
Tails like,

3798
01:39:32,941 --> 01:39:33,600
nah,

3799
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,870
he's probably got 15
voicemails on oscar's phone.

3800
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:37,820
Oscar and call him back.

3801
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:39,480
I'll asked,

3802
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:40,380
is just sitting there going,

3803
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:41,610
fuck tito ortiz.

3804
01:39:41,611 --> 01:39:44,760
Willing to postpone retirement
to kick someone's ass again.

3805
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:45,450
Yeah,

3806
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:46,080
see,

3807
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,530
but the thing is he's going to try
to do that with oscar and golden boy.

3808
01:39:49,531 --> 01:39:51,650
And that's going to sell $13,000.

3809
01:39:51,651 --> 01:39:52,560
Pay per view buys.

3810
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:53,940
Nobody's going to buy that.

3811
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:54,451
Well,

3812
01:39:54,451 --> 01:39:54,781
I mean,

3813
01:39:54,781 --> 01:39:55,120
if,

3814
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:56,580
if child gets the marketing,

3815
01:39:56,581 --> 01:39:57,414
somebody will buy it.

3816
01:39:57,870 --> 01:39:58,180
Look,

3817
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:03,180
if they could figure out a
real competitive fight for
tito against someone who's

3818
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:06,570
got a big name and I don't know
who that big name would be,

3819
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:08,910
but he could still sell some.

3820
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:10,830
Did you see the um,

3821
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:13,080
did you see somebody posted these?

3822
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:17,970
I think cannot tell the raja posted these
two videos of tito where it was like

3823
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:21,060
somebody was asking him how does he
feel about this fight with chuck?

3824
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:21,750
And he's like,

3825
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,640
I'm a much better fighting.

3826
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:23,610
I was 12 years ago.

3827
01:40:23,670 --> 01:40:24,600
I'm much better fighter,

3828
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:25,860
be bigger,

3829
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:26,833
I'm stronger,

3830
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:27,773
I'm younger,

3831
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:29,500
I'm cities younger.

3832
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:33,980
It gets a little flustered with said
he wanted to outlive as kids too,

3833
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:34,411
like to.

3834
01:40:34,411 --> 01:40:37,410
That's the worst thing you also said.

3835
01:40:37,411 --> 01:40:37,871
You also said,

3836
01:40:37,871 --> 01:40:38,670
he also said,

3837
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:39,211
the guy's like,

3838
01:40:39,211 --> 01:40:41,430
so who's making the money
off of the paper view?

3839
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:42,181
Is it just you?

3840
01:40:42,181 --> 01:40:45,360
Is it all the fighters in the
card or is it just you and chuck?

3841
01:40:45,361 --> 01:40:45,900
And he's like,

3842
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:46,260
yeah,

3843
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:47,430
it's me and myself and chuck,

3844
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:49,180
we're going to make the
money off of the peer view.

3845
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:49,771
You know,

3846
01:40:49,771 --> 01:40:50,101
he just,

3847
01:40:50,101 --> 01:40:52,170
he just gets flooded and he just
powered through these things.

3848
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:52,810
Yeah.

3849
01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:53,410
Well,

3850
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:53,980
you know,

3851
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,420
it's not a talkers
business fighters business.

3852
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:58,150
Yeah.

3853
01:40:58,150 --> 01:40:58,751
It's weird.

3854
01:40:58,751 --> 01:40:58,991
You know,

3855
01:40:58,991 --> 01:40:59,530
you're asked,

3856
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:03,520
asked to be several things and when a
guy like conor comes along or a guy like

3857
01:41:03,521 --> 01:41:04,420
colby covington.

3858
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:04,661
Oh,

3859
01:41:04,661 --> 01:41:05,950
that was the other thing
I want to talk about.

3860
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:09,280
They're talking about colby not
fighting tyron for the title now.

3861
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:12,370
And then eastman leap frogging over colby,

3862
01:41:12,371 --> 01:41:13,630
who's the interim champ?

3863
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,340
Didn't they strip colby?

3864
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:16,780
Did they strip him?

3865
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:19,620
I believe he called the stripped maybe.

3866
01:41:20,130 --> 01:41:20,830
Yeah,

3867
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:21,551
maybe they did strip.

3868
01:41:21,551 --> 01:41:21,671
Um,

3869
01:41:21,671 --> 01:41:22,690
which is also weird.

3870
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,400
Which is weird because like,

3871
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:27,380
that should've been tyrants first
fight back from that shoulder surgery,

3872
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:28,100
you know,

3873
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:29,140
that's what the interim is for,

3874
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:29,470
right?

3875
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:30,100
Yeah.

3876
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:30,270
I mean,

3877
01:41:30,270 --> 01:41:30,640
that's,

3878
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,450
if it's not,

3879
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:32,650
then what's an interim for.

3880
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:34,930
Unless if they stripped him,

3881
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:38,300
the only reason why I
could see saying uzma,

3882
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:41,830
but also that's another thing where I
think it's probably negotiation tactics.

3883
01:41:41,831 --> 01:41:44,050
It's like the nate diaz
dust employee a thing.

3884
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:47,830
I remember looking this up and someone
was trying to correct me last time I did,

3885
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:49,240
it was supposed to be,

3886
01:41:49,241 --> 01:41:52,120
which I don't know if it actually happened
when that fight happened with tyron

3887
01:41:52,121 --> 01:41:53,770
until when that fight happened,

3888
01:41:53,771 --> 01:41:54,850
he was supposed to be stripped,

3889
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:56,710
but he's on the website.

3890
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:58,660
He still listed as the interim champ.

3891
01:41:59,020 --> 01:41:59,351
Well,

3892
01:41:59,351 --> 01:42:02,500
it's a good move to keep them in the
interim champ if they decide to fight

3893
01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:04,240
because then the champ versus champ,

3894
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:05,051
you know,

3895
01:42:05,051 --> 01:42:06,580
if they do decide to make that fight,

3896
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:08,170
I feel like on paper,

3897
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:10,180
at least financially,

3898
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:11,950
it's a good fight because uh,

3899
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,740
like colby talks so much shit.

3900
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:16,870
It's like it's worth,

3901
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:21,520
it's worth putting together just for
that because people don't know huisman is

3902
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:22,423
as much,

3903
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:24,460
but it was a nightmare for anybody.

3904
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:26,830
He is the biggest,

3905
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:27,461
I believe,

3906
01:42:27,461 --> 01:42:29,530
biggest threat to tyron right now.

3907
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:30,760
Solid wrestling,

3908
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:33,250
striking conditioning.

3909
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:34,750
Everything super strong.

3910
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:35,800
Yeah,

3911
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:40,000
and just has been on a tear and has
gotten better with every fight has been

3912
01:42:40,001 --> 01:42:40,834
proven.

3913
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:43,870
Has gone through the trial
by fire inside the octagon.

3914
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,130
Exactly like colby has.

3915
01:42:45,131 --> 01:42:46,330
Colby has the wrestling,

3916
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:48,250
I'm submission awareness.

3917
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:51,370
At least his offensive
submissions aren't the best,

3918
01:42:51,371 --> 01:42:55,630
but he can finish you and
his striking is competent,

3919
01:42:55,631 --> 01:42:56,890
but he has no power.

3920
01:42:57,670 --> 01:43:00,770
He's not going to hurt
tyra in term title holder.

3921
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:01,863
Okay.

3922
01:43:02,030 --> 01:43:02,800
Yeah.

3923
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,510
So they didn't strip them
to decide to keep them,

3924
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:05,351
but who knows,

3925
01:43:05,351 --> 01:43:07,410
they might have just not Kevin Mcdonald,

3926
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:08,381
the website.

3927
01:43:08,381 --> 01:43:09,400
He was one of my students.

3928
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:09,881
Really?

3929
01:43:09,881 --> 01:43:10,390
Yeah.

3930
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:11,223
Wow,

3931
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:12,280
that's great.

3932
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:13,113
It's great ref.

3933
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:13,331
Yeah,

3934
01:43:13,331 --> 01:43:14,164
he's a good rough.

3935
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:14,860
Um,

3936
01:43:14,860 --> 01:43:15,341
the uh,

3937
01:43:15,341 --> 01:43:16,780
the colby thing is interesting.

3938
01:43:16,810 --> 01:43:17,200
You know,

3939
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:18,610
it's like his fight again,

3940
01:43:18,611 --> 01:43:19,560
hafael dot sohn.

3941
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:21,370
Joe's like anybody who
thought he wasn't for real,

3942
01:43:21,371 --> 01:43:22,060
like you see that fit,

3943
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:22,900
you beat the shit out.

3944
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:25,840
Dos anjos his conditioning is incredible.

3945
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:26,940
I mean that is,

3946
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:28,810
that is one of the big
things about that dude.

3947
01:43:28,811 --> 01:43:29,621
This is conditioning.

3948
01:43:29,621 --> 01:43:30,490
It's off the charts.

3949
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:31,190
He doesn't get tired.

3950
01:43:31,190 --> 01:43:32,410
It does not get tired.

3951
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:33,580
He's a fucking animal.

3952
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:34,030
Yeah.

3953
01:43:34,030 --> 01:43:36,370
So that's the thing that
makes that fight interesting.

3954
01:43:36,371 --> 01:43:37,120
With tire.

3955
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:38,290
Can he push tyron?

3956
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:39,850
But kenny survive.

3957
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:40,713
That's the thing.

3958
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:42,100
That's the big thing.

3959
01:43:42,210 --> 01:43:46,170
See dos anjos is more of a
volume striker at one 70.

3960
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:48,050
He's not going to knock
those bigger guys out.

3961
01:43:48,310 --> 01:43:49,780
But tyron and knock on anybody.

3962
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,320
So this is a.

3963
01:43:51,710 --> 01:43:51,980
I want

3964
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:52,670
to see that fight.

3965
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:54,080
And the thing with colby,

3966
01:43:54,290 --> 01:43:56,030
like the last time I trained with him,

3967
01:43:56,031 --> 01:43:56,990
it's been about a year,

3968
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,450
but at that point he was hard to miss.

3969
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:00,893
You know,

3970
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:02,180
for me,

3971
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:05,420
I know I'm a striker but I'm tiring.

3972
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:06,980
Like tyrons got good.

3973
01:44:06,981 --> 01:44:07,900
Chris boxing put,

3974
01:44:07,901 --> 01:44:09,300
he hit so hard,

3975
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,040
so strong.

3976
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:12,250
He's so

3977
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:12,760
fast,

3978
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:13,810
like a straight right hand.

3979
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:15,250
I remember when he fought,

3980
01:44:15,251 --> 01:44:16,840
I'm carlos condit,

3981
01:44:17,170 --> 01:44:19,060
he hit them with a lead right
hand and I was just like

3982
01:44:19,110 --> 01:44:19,440
whoa.

3983
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:22,110
Somebody like removed
some friends from that.

3984
01:44:22,111 --> 01:44:22,801
From reality.

3985
01:44:22,801 --> 01:44:25,590
He crossed over so fast
like this distance,

3986
01:44:25,591 --> 01:44:27,240
like he closed the distance so quick.

3987
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:28,170
He's explosive.

3988
01:44:28,270 --> 01:44:29,670
He's so fast.

3989
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:31,410
I don't know.

3990
01:44:31,410 --> 01:44:35,100
I tyron is a real champion,

3991
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:35,940
you know what I mean?

3992
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:40,940
He's a real champion and not getting the
credit that he deserves for a long time

3993
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:43,020
and that bothers him,

3994
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:43,850
but he's in a

3995
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:46,090
handful of the greatest wall
towards of all time now,

3996
01:44:46,091 --> 01:44:46,751
in my opinion.

3997
01:44:46,751 --> 01:44:50,140
You got matt hughes who's a legend
and of course george st pierre,

3998
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:53,770
robbie lawler and then tyrone
who knocked out robbie lawler.

3999
01:44:53,771 --> 01:44:54,730
I mean in my opinion,

4000
01:44:54,731 --> 01:44:58,150
he's right up there and
then as these winds pile up,

4001
01:44:58,550 --> 01:45:01,630
you make more of a case of him
being the best welterweight ever.

4002
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:02,460
Yeah,

4003
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:03,293
tiring.

4004
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:05,300
With that being said,

4005
01:45:05,350 --> 01:45:05,720
he's.

4006
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:08,000
He's beaten a lot of the
guys in the division,

4007
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:09,170
but he needs,

4008
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:10,100
like you said earlier,

4009
01:45:10,101 --> 01:45:11,750
he needs a fight like a gsp.

4010
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:16,250
He needs some something where somebody
else's established because with him

4011
01:45:16,251 --> 01:45:18,830
coming in and taken out robbie and
and all these other young guys,

4012
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:21,260
they proven amongst themselves
and amongst each other,

4013
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:22,310
but a lot of the,

4014
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,911
like you said,

4015
01:45:22,911 --> 01:45:23,391
nobody knows.

4016
01:45:23,391 --> 01:45:25,590
Come on with simon and huseman.

4017
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,031
He's.

4018
01:45:26,031 --> 01:45:29,240
He's a threat to everybody.

4019
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:29,930
Everybody,

4020
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:30,680
you know,

4021
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:32,080
he's been wanting and he's been wonderful,

4022
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:33,770
but he's been wanting down until he wants.

4023
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:37,540
He wants everybody because he
wants a shot at the belt and um,

4024
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,440
I believe for real,

4025
01:45:39,441 --> 01:45:40,274
he's the biggest,

4026
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,420
biggest threat to tiring,

4027
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:46,790
but I'm tyron could win that fight also
can win it convincingly and then it

4028
01:45:46,791 --> 01:45:47,660
means nothing to the,

4029
01:45:47,661 --> 01:45:51,680
to the world who tyron wants to
respect what he's done as the champion.

4030
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:52,341
Yeah.

4031
01:45:52,341 --> 01:45:52,910
In that case,

4032
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:56,030
that's one of the reasons why the
fight with colby makes the most sense.

4033
01:45:56,031 --> 01:45:58,190
I think it would be
the most controversial,

4034
01:45:58,191 --> 01:45:59,520
highest profile because colby,

4035
01:45:59,521 --> 01:46:00,740
we'll talk mad shit.

4036
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:05,780
Time will get really angry and if he
beats him and smashes him then it steps up

4037
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,070
him and puts him in a.

4038
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:08,750
And then in the meantime,

4039
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:11,510
I mean tills not going to
fight at one 70 anymore.

4040
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:13,040
Tills moved up to one 85.

4041
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:13,490
Okay.

4042
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:14,290
So like,

4043
01:46:14,290 --> 01:46:18,350
but you still have a plethora of
killers in the welterweight division.

4044
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:20,060
I mean you can make a lot of match ups,

4045
01:46:20,230 --> 01:46:21,070
but the colby fight,

4046
01:46:21,071 --> 01:46:23,500
the colby fight also could
help tire and get over to.

4047
01:46:23,501 --> 01:46:27,640
Because colby is going to talk a lot of
shit and some of it's disrespectful and

4048
01:46:27,641 --> 01:46:27,971
people,

4049
01:46:27,971 --> 01:46:28,570
people,

4050
01:46:28,570 --> 01:46:30,700
people like to see those guys get stopped.

4051
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:31,490
It's true.

4052
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:32,323
It's true.

4053
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:33,590
So that's,

4054
01:46:33,690 --> 01:46:34,290
that's that.

4055
01:46:34,290 --> 01:46:38,500
Maybe that's what that's like
to see those guys get stopped.

4056
01:46:38,890 --> 01:46:41,730
Not just get beat the
tire and win that fight.

4057
01:46:41,731 --> 01:46:41,890
Yeah,

4058
01:46:41,890 --> 01:46:46,600
for the most part he has to stop colby
because colby is not going to quit.

4059
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:49,500
And in the fourth round he's gonna.

4060
01:46:49,501 --> 01:46:50,700
He's gonna step on the gas.

4061
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:52,680
Tyron can't keep up.

4062
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:54,000
Then it's going to be a problem.

4063
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:57,550
I got david goggins
here to nice max amount.

4064
01:46:58,260 --> 01:46:59,610
Anything else before we get out of here?

4065
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:01,530
The only other thing was the ketone meals.

4066
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:02,790
Like those things are awesome.

4067
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:03,661
They want to make an,

4068
01:47:03,661 --> 01:47:05,860
an elk meal and they want it.

4069
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:06,930
They want to talk to you about,

4070
01:47:06,931 --> 01:47:07,291
about,

4071
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:07,800
about it.

4072
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:09,000
We'll talk about that afterwards.

4073
01:47:09,850 --> 01:47:10,140
So what,

4074
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:10,980
what does that company,

4075
01:47:10,981 --> 01:47:11,750
what is a ketone,

4076
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:12,660
ketone bodies,

4077
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:15,000
ketone bodies and ketone meals.

4078
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:15,720
Um,

4079
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:16,260
and um,

4080
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:17,160
you can look them up online.

4081
01:47:17,161 --> 01:47:18,870
He told me you're working with them.

4082
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:19,351
Yes.

4083
01:47:19,351 --> 01:47:19,461
They,

4084
01:47:19,461 --> 01:47:21,240
they've been sponsoring me
and him send me good stuff.

01:47:21,241 --> 01:47:21,780
To my house.

Beautiful.

4087
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,080
We'll talk either.
