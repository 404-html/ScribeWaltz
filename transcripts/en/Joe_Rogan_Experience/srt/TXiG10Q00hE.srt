1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,070
Five four, three, two, one, boom,

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,630
and we're live with the Oji of ogs.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,100
If there is more of an Oji
MMA character than you,

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,180
I don't know who the fuck they
would be more. Who's hoists Gracie,

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,590
and that's about as, oh Geez. It
gets right. You know what that means?

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,220
What does it mean? You're both fucking
old. We're all, yeah, we're all mood.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,440
I was watching the,
there was a,

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,560
the other day was the 20th anniversary
of Dan Henderson's first UFC appearance.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,690
Oh my God, me interviewing
them afterwards. I'm like,

10
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:31,950
who's that fucking little kid?

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,490
You and Dan Hennah just who's Dan
Henderson pretended to be Dan Henderson,

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,140
UFC 12 Dothan, Alabama.
You got transferred? Yeah.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:40,711
What?

14
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:45,711
We're supposed to go up to buffalo
and they canceled it out of New York.

15
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:49,470
New York said, get Outta here and we
had to take a puddle jumper plane.

16
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:53,850
Remember all that jazz really very
well. I was in court. God Damn.

17
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:57,790
I knew I was in trouble. Yeah,
you were one of the, you mean you,

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,940
you were one of the people
that I cite all the time for.

19
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:03,630
Why that stupid reason
that the 12 to six elbow,

20
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,430
you're the one who just it to me cause I
couldn't believe what you're telling me

21
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,640
was true at the reason 12 to six elbows
were illegal. Well, just tell the story.

22
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,000
The truth of the stories back.

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,180
There's so many stories about rules and
how they came about and you know there's

24
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:25,270
guys claiming things and it's
like, really? Okay. You look at,

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,280
I have paperwork that shows how the war,

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,010
how things came out and
at what time it was.

27
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:35,370
And I still have my computers that I
have things written on that we went over

28
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:38,520
stuff. But you have computers from
the nineties dude, I still have no,

29
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:42,320
I've got floppy disk. No, you don't
swear to God. He'd do. Unbelievable.

30
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,340
You do with it. How much can a floppy,
this whole, not even like a Manga,

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,210
right? Nothing holds a couple
of pages of a document.

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,610
But you remember when the floppy
disk went away, everybody panicked.

33
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,150
Like what are you doing?
You fucking taken away the floppy desk.

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,110
What are you going to put stuff on that?
When Matt got rid of the floppy disk,

35
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:04,650
I remember people like these guys are
assholes. Like what are they thinking?

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,550
But anyways, when, when the
unified rules, you know,

37
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:13,050
what happened was everyone
looks at the UFC and says,

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,920
oh well you know,

39
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:18,921
when the UFC went to the first show that
was done in New Jersey was the IFC Paul

40
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,460
Smith's show.
It was done in September,

41
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,210
I want to say 1999 okay.

42
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:31,090
And the UFC went there
in November of 1999 and,

43
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,860
and yet you have to go back and understand
the history of what was going on.

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,340
And this is where I have my issues with
people that try to change history and

45
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:42,030
rewrite things.

46
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:47,031
And what was going on was 7,400 team
of group at the time owned the UFC.

47
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:49,350
That's who you were working,

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,370
Bob Meyrowitz Meyrowitz
and Mclaren Campbell.

49
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:57,300
Mclaren was long gone and you know,
and I love I then by 19 Oh my God. Yes.

50
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,620
He was there when I came around in 97 I
think he hired you. Yeah. And you know,

51
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:06,670
he did some stuff and he comes up with,
I'm the cocreator the UFC.

52
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,400
You know what, let me just ask one
question. If you're the cocreator,

53
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,730
how come you never owned one
bit of it doesn't make sense.

54
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:20,530
Doesn't out Campbell Mclaren. Yes.
Dare you. You know what? I'm tired.

55
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,350
Why lie?
He did things and I will,

56
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:28,351
I will absolutely give him credit for
what he did because he was the reason that

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,680
it actually made it to pay per view
because art Davey had gone to everyone.

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,890
Prime ticket at the time was a paper view
provider because the paper view world

59
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:43,760
back then was about 15 million in the u
s it's not like it is now. You know, you,

60
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,780
you were limited,
but prime ticket was one.

61
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:51,430
Hbo was another and he had
gone to all those and they
all turn no, no, no, no, no.

62
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,220
And there was this one company,

63
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:59,221
Semafore entertainment group out of New
York that did rock and roll shows and

64
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:02,840
they did one sporting event.
It was Martina Nevada,

65
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Nevada Lova against Jimmy
Connors and tennis. Oh Wow.

66
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:10,840
Remake of the remake of the Billie
Jean King Bobby Riggs thing.

67
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,920
Wow, I remember that.
That's crazy. That was them.

68
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,990
I didn't know that was [inaudible].

69
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,380
That was the only sporting thing they'd
ever done before the UFC. But they were,

70
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,100
they were looking for something
that they could rerun and,

71
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,260
and make happen again and again.

72
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,410
And Campbell looked at what
art brought to him and said,

73
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,000
I think this could be that thing.
And Horry and came up with the idea.

74
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:37,980
Horian Gracie, negative, negative, not
true. He says he came up with the idea.

75
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,350
Are you saying you calling out
Horian Gracie? He not calling

76
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,790
big John doesn't fuck around. Look at
horror. Horror, horror. Ian had his thing.

77
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,940
I love, you know what? I fell
in love with what they did.

78
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:56,110
That's how I got involved.
Right. But horian are,

79
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:59,140
Davey went to Horian
because he needed validity.

80
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:04,141
He needed somebody to give actual value
and some credence to what he was trying

81
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:09,160
to do because he went to
Horace Mann off of, uh, uh,

82
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:12,930
there was an article in Playboy
magazine, bad, you know,

83
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,850
and it was about Horian.
And you know, at this guy,

84
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:18,890
this family that would fight anybody.
And you know Chad,

85
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,060
it was a bad article
that would called back.

86
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,750
That was the actual title
B a d across two pages.

87
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:30,190
Bad was the, I remember we had a article,
I don't remember that part about it,

88
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:30,601
but it was,

89
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:34,630
it was basically they were offering like
a lot of money to fight anybody. Right.

90
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,210
It went well. It was the whole thing
of the hundred thousand dollar check,

91
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,540
but he didn't have $100,000,
you know, and so it was,

92
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:44,050
well if you bring $100,000 I'll put up
a hundred no one's bringing $100,000.

93
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,940
Right. So just more like a
publicity stunt. Yeah, they did.

94
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:52,180
Obviously they had the Gracie challenge
before that and they did all the Gracie

95
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:54,600
in action tapes that we'd all seen.
Yup.

96
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,010
And he'd see all these karate
masters it down, strangled, you

97
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,150
know, and that was, that was the thing
that I loved the fact when, you know,

98
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,580
I can go through the whole thing of how
I met Horian but when I met him there

99
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:10,850
was never anything
about, well you know, we,

100
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:14,180
we would do this and that situation but
we can't do that cause will hurt you or

101
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,210
something like that was what happened
in a lot of martial arts all,

102
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,710
well we can't do that because that
would really, that will hurt you,

103
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:23,690
that will kill you. And he was
like, let's do it right. Every time.

104
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,540
And that's what I fell in love with.
It's like, hey, they're not phony.

105
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,880
They're real. Right. Yeah.

106
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,880
And the first time I ever did anything
with them all hoists Gracie arm barred me

107
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:35,630
and I went, how did you do that? And
then I just fell in love with it.

108
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,840
A lot of people said that
about hoists Gracie. Yeah.

109
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,100
Those early days of the UFC was,
boy, I mean you want to talk about,

110
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,130
I mean he really played it out perfectly
because he really was the best version

111
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,360
of explaining Jujitsu.
Like what did,

112
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,000
how did he show the effectiveness of
Jujitsu? Well, here's what you do.

113
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,210
You'll lock some dudes
in a cage with no rules,

114
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,070
guides bigger than him and he's
wearing his geeky. So he looks,

115
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,470
he's the only one that looks like,
like what we think of as a martial artist,

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,180
right?
And you get these guys,

117
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:11,420
everyone else looks like big old street
thugs that jacked up on steroids.

118
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:13,340
They're giant and they're
running after him.

119
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:18,341
And we always would think of like Bruce
Lee in these martial artists who it

120
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,880
technique over size and they would beat
all these people, but in the real world,

121
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:26,810
that shit didn't work. Nope.
It just didn't work. Bigger
guys always fucked you up.

122
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,470
They were heavier. He hit him. It
didn't work. It bounced off of them.

123
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,240
That got you on the ground.
They punched your face in.

124
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,400
But all of a sudden there was this
little guy wasn't little, but you know,

125
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:38,060
it was 175 pounds in comparison
to the rest of the people.

126
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:43,010
He was fairly small and he's tapping guys
at triangles off his back and arm bar

127
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:47,240
and people and, and everybody with
greatest, greatest infomercial ever.

128
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,100
It was the greatest. Exactly. Got me on
board. I mean to me and everybody else,

129
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:55,640
man, all these people that like me
came from a striking background.

130
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,240
I was like Holy Shit. And that's like,
this is crazy. That's where I look at.

131
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:04,241
Horian was brilliant because he listened
to what art said and goes and so whose

132
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:09,410
idea was it? It was art. It was art idea
to have a bunch of guys fight. Absolutely.

133
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,170
100% well how much did art,

134
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,830
how much of the art owner that he owned a,

135
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:19,220
I want to say basically 25%
20 when they sold it to,

136
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,620
cause they had zoomba he got a piece of
that. Oh well no, he was, he was gone.

137
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,380
Gone it before that you've got to
figure when there was two there was wow.

138
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:33,381
Promotions and wild promotions came from
war of the worlds because art had named

139
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:38,540
the whole competition or the world.
Ah.

140
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,710
And then Semafore entertainment group
changed it to the ultimate fighter.

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,630
I vaguely remembered that whole thing.

142
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:48,620
Guy Named Michael Abrams is the
one that named it. So it when,

143
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,650
when art had with Horian he gave Horian
25% he had 25% and Bob Myerwitz own 50%

144
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,160
because of putting it on paper

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,420
view.
Ah,

146
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:01,980
so you had while promotions owning 50%
Semafore for entertainment group owning

147
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:03,840
50% and actually wow.

148
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:08,750
Owned a little bit less because they
had brought together investors and they

149
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:13,751
were trying to get $250,000 and they got
somewhere around 115,000 and $12,000 of

150
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:18,360
investment that they put up cause that
was going to be part of the money for the

151
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:20,820
people that we're competing in it.
It's crazy.

152
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:22,410
When you think about what it is now,

153
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,580
this is where we're talking about 1993
what new sport can you think of other

154
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:33,681
than MMA from 1993 that's
now a huge global force.

155
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,620
I mean, it is something that everybody
talks about globally. Nothing.

156
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,380
The one thing that you
can look at and say, wow,

157
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:44,580
that that's really gained traction.
American Ninja Warrior. Oh yeah.

158
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,550
But it's not right. It's an
athletic competition. Yeah,

159
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:50,190
it's a show that
definitely gained traction.

160
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,660
That's a fun fucking show it dude.
How fun that show was.

161
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,900
I didn't ever watched it until like a
year ago. Those people are incredible.

162
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,200
Oh yeah.
As far as athletes and the ability to,

163
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,230
I mean just the grip strength cause
you know everyone thinks that,

164
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:08,220
oh you can hang on a bar forever.
No you can't.

165
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,790
We learned in fear factor that girls
are better at that than guys because

166
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,120
Holly's body weight, I wouldn't
have believed it. I looked at this,

167
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:17,430
well we have this one guy in
the show that was jacked, big,

168
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:21,690
thick old dude and there was girls
that were like, you know, 125 pounds,

169
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:24,090
hundred 30 pounds and this guy was,

170
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,900
he was toast it like a minute and 30
seconds he was done and these girls were

171
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:29,640
hanging in there. I was
like, this is crazy.

172
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,640
This is really interesting because I
would think the girls' hands were weak,

173
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,770
I would think. Nope.
Because it's, it's a matter,

174
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,680
the only difference that
you can make it as you,

175
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,680
you take change the size of the bar and
start making the bar bigger. Oh yeah.

176
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,980
It starts to have more of an advantage
because of his hand being bigger. Right,

177
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,260
right. But that will take the
advantage away from the girl.

178
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:50,190
Cause now she's actually starting to cup
over it or finger strength starts to go

179
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:54,670
before I, yeah. So, um, yeah, so MMA who,

180
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,960
who named it mixed martial
arts, you know, that's a,

181
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,120
that's a whole story. And you're going
to hear, I heard it was you. Well I,

182
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,430
I give credit to Jeff Blatnick
as far as look at, ah,

183
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,180
he didn't come up with the term who did,
but the truth,

184
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,320
and this is the first thing I can
tell you, I wrote, I wrote a, uh,

185
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,800
I had to do it what's called a work
permit for LAPD because I worked for LAPD

186
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,050
back in 1993, 93, [inaudible] 94.

187
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,390
And it was because I was going
to referee this second UFC,

188
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:37,620
which was March 11th of 1994
and for me to actually work,

189
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,640
the department has to allow me to,
I have to ask for permission,

190
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:43,440
and then they have to
grant that permission.

191
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,110
Was there a concern that
it was too outrageous?

192
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:49,800
So that was part of the whole
thing is I didn't want to say, Oh,

193
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:51,210
I've got two guys going into a cage,

194
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,980
they're going to beat the
shit out of each other. So the

195
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,750
first thing I put was martial
arts referee. Hmm, okay.
And then they said, well,

196
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,890
what kind of martial arts?
So I wrote mixed martial arts referee.

197
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,700
Now I can tell you that that was in 90
right at the end of 93 [inaudible] not a

198
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,390
term.

199
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,630
I didn't get it from anywhere other than
I'm sitting there trying to think of,

200
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:16,090
but I do know that there was a columnist,

201
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,100
a sports writer from the La Times
that wrote about the very first UFC,

202
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,250
and in his article wrote mixed martial
arts. Ah, so maybe it was Hansel.

203
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,770
Well, you've got John [inaudible].
He's saying that he's, you know,

204
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,870
he did it back in 1983 it's like,
okay, well if no one's saying it,

205
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,070
it doesn't mean shit. Okay.
So the truth of the matter is,

206
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:43,030
so Peretti might have said it, he might've
said it, but it didn't mean anything.

207
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,020
Right. Because the fact of the matter
is, and it doesn't matter what I wrote,

208
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,070
what matters is when, you
know, and when you joined it,

209
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,570
when you joined the UFC,
it was still considered no holds barred.

210
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,070
NHB Yeah. He was what we called.
And it was something that was,

211
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,590
and this is probably part
of my problem with Campbell.

212
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,490
Mclaren is back at you before UFC too,
you know,

213
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,660
they had them on Good Morning America
with Jim Brown and you go back to that and

214
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:14,210
he came up with the line that
you could win by knockout,

215
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,990
tap out or death.
Okay.

216
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,680
And four years after that,

217
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,710
I was in court having that thrown in my
face by the fricking attorneys trying to

218
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:30,730
put us down saying, isn't this
what you are companies? No,

219
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:34,540
that's not what my cock fighting.
That's what an idiot said. Yeah. Okay.

220
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:38,500
And so he still to this day things,
he was magnificent with that.

221
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,080
But you look and you go might have been
in terms of buying it drew attention,

222
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,240
it drew attention.
There's no doubt.

223
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,290
But when we were trying to combat that,

224
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,530
we were trying to get away from no
holds barred because the whole no holds

225
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,420
barred met. There's no
rules. And there was a rule.

226
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,490
But the thing is it's
still no holds barred.

227
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:02,090
I mean you could do inside heel
hooks, you could do the MNR, he choke,

228
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,450
you can do whatever you want holds
in terms of holes. That's true.

229
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:09,040
It's like it came from wrestling, right?
Absolutely. Wrestling there was it? No,

230
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,860
I mean bars in amateur wrestling, there
was things you couldn't do, right?

231
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,630
There's certain head box you
couldn't do in wrestling comp.

232
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,550
You have to have an arm in and instead
of having just the neck holds barred,

233
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:24,050
so no holds barred. It's essentially
still and HB, but they're, you know,

234
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,680
but back then it was,
was there eye gouging ever?

235
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,480
No, never. The very first set of
rules for the first UFC. And you know,

236
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:34,340
and this is again, you know
there's people saying, oh,

237
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,370
I came up with the five minute round.
It's like you're a fucking liar. Sorry,

238
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,960
you aren't calling everybody.

239
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,210
I'm tired of fricking sitting there
having people lie because there's a lot of

240
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:46,670
people out there that come up
with stuff and you go, really?

241
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,330
I can prove that wrong when you're
talking about five minute rounds,

242
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,200
the very first

243
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,210
had three rules, no
eye gouging, no biting,

244
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,060
no groin strikes,
everything else was allowed.

245
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:00,710
When did groin strikes
coming to the picture though?

246
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:03,680
Because everybody remembers Keith
Hackney and Joe Song. Okay, hold on.

247
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,150
So that was cool.

248
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,180
That was UFC one and it was
unlimited five minute rounds.

249
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,090
Wasn't Keith Hackney chosen?
You see four, yeah. Okay. Yeah,

250
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,430
this is now,
this one was unlimited,

251
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,690
unlimited five minute rounds,
but no fight went the five minutes.

252
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,950
The longest one was two
minutes and 30 seconds. Right?

253
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,300
So after the first UFC,

254
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,960
the Semafore looked and said,
well,

255
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,890
why are we having rounds when none of the
fights? We're going that long anyways.

256
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,240
And so we're just going to take the round
thing away so we don't have any stop

257
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:44,990
in the action. And then there was
certain fighters, Zane Frazier being,

258
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,360
you know,

259
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,580
the main ones saying if I could have need
to the groin like I would in my system

260
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,310
and what I do, it would have been
a completely different fight.

261
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,780
And they went and said, okay, you can knee
to the groin, you can hit to the groin.

262
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,880
No eye gouging. No biting. That
was UFC too. That was the rules.

263
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,210
Wow.
So no eye gouging,

264
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:09,710
no biting and no time on it's
UFC to no time limits. Wow.

265
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,660
It's just so crazy to think that
this is a giant sport that's on Fox.

266
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,010
It's on ESPN. It's a huge paper view
force. You hear about it all the time.

267
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,160
You have a, a real group of
experts wearing suits and ties,

268
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:23,960
discussing techniques that,
I mean,

269
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:27,740
when you sit down and watch the foc
panel and you see like Tyron Woodley and

270
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:29,780
Michael Bisbing,
Paul Felder,

271
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:34,100
and everybody's sitting there discussing
technique and strategy and they need to

272
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:37,040
thank people from the past. That
crap in there. Yeah. I mean,

273
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:41,060
you go back and watch some of the old
school shit where the sumo guy got his

274
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,580
tooth kicked into the spine. That
got me my job. Did it really? Yeah.

275
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:48,410
That fight right there. That's how
I got my job. What happened? Well,

276
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,240
Horian and brought in two guys.
He brought in Leo Vizio from Brazil,

277
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:58,130
who is a, he's famous as being
the death squad cop down in Rio.

278
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,870
And they brought in a guy
named [inaudible] [inaudible]
and [inaudible] was the

279
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:07,871
referee for that very first fight between
Taylor Tulia and Gerardo and drug or

280
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:12,290
doe. Who was that gentleman that
he could, he blinded a guy. Oh,

281
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,600
you're talking about in cow.
Cow.

282
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,890
Cow Eventually went on to fight Hixson
Hixson Hixson wouldn't punch him because

283
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,530
of his eye. He knew is I
was all fucked up. You know,

284
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,770
there's been a couple of
fights where I can tell you,

285
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,130
you hoist had a fight and uh,
you go back and watch it.

286
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,830
You'll see he doesn't punch somebody
because his father told him,

287
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:32,420
don't punch him. Yeah. You know,

288
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:35,180
and that's part of that was part
of like even the Gracie challenges.

289
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:38,660
I can tell you back when, you
know, even I did a couple, it was,

290
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,620
they would tell you,
you know,

291
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,460
Horian was big into you want to come
into the school, you want to do this.

292
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,040
If he didn't think the
person had that much talent,

293
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,200
he would put a student against him.

294
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:50,280
He would never put one of his brothers
if he thought the guy was actually good,

295
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:52,470
he put his brother right.
And you know,

296
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,460
one of the things they would tell you
is hey, take him down. Choke him out.

297
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,660
Armbar don't, don't hit him. Right.

298
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,370
And afterwards they would go and tell
the person, you know, hey, you know,

299
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:04,200
what do you think? You know,
do you believe, you know,

300
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,370
and if the person who you know wanted
to try again, they would hit him,

301
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,110
beat him now fuck heard him yell back.
And that was okay.

302
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:14,640
So you would know this then.

303
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,350
What is the story about Hixon
not being in the first UFC?

304
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:22,120
Cause everybody knows
everybody that knows you. Just,

305
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,130
who knows that Hixon is widely
regarded as the greatest of all time.

306
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,630
Like when it comes to the Gracies,
when it comes to anybody of that error,

307
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,070
Hickson was the fucking man. Hands
down. You ask anybody still is the map.

308
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,900
But isn't it crazy? It's still as the mat.
But if you ask anybody, no one said Nah,

309
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,630
it was Ricardo the barrio or Nah,
it was this guy.

310
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,600
Everybody went Hixon how fucking
good do you have to be? Exactly.

311
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,480
Everybody agrees. That's how lucky
I was. I got to the, he was my,

312
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,710
he was my instructor. Isn't that
crazy? It's crazy because you know,

313
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,120
you look in you and it,

314
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,470
and this is the whole thing of this is
what people don't understand and I hear

315
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,960
it guys now and it's like, God damn, are
you that stupid? Because there's a wall.

316
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:05,720
I think that, you know, so
and so could beat him down.

317
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,970
It's like that's a decent 60 years
old. It did. But not only that,

318
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:12,000
it's a different world now.
Exactly what Hickson was.

319
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,680
He was so advanced in comparison to
everybody else physically because he had

320
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:17,790
figured out yoga.

321
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,020
He had figured out breathing and
meditation and physical strength.

322
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,020
He was incredibly flexible.

323
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,110
I'm sure you've seen those exercises
he did on the balancing beam where he's

324
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,300
standing on a balancing beam with one
leg doing a full split in the air,

325
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,490
holding his foot up in the air full
split and he had physical abilities that

326
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:39,150
were you just unparalleled.
He had a muscular dearth we use,

327
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:42,430
he used to do just an exercise class.
Okay.

328
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Back in 91 or so and he
would do one leg at Pike's,

329
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,350
swung down one leg, kick your
leg out. He would do that.

330
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,360
He had a muscular endurance.
He would do 51 legged pikes.

331
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,810
I mean, and I would, I was dying. I
mean I was like, that's incredible.

332
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:02,970
In a row in a row.
He was,

333
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,950
he would just keep going and
people guys were falling out.

334
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,190
I was falling out and everybody and
he just keeps going and going and go,

335
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,600
what are you made of? Well, he just
had unbelievable discipline and, and,

336
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:18,000
and also like, and just an understanding
of his body, you know, I mean,

337
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,100
his, his whole thing was he said
he was so basic. Joe, you know,

338
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:24,990
his Jujitsu, you look at guys
now and you know what I mean?

339
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,010
And then you look at like Eddie,
I love it.

340
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:31,170
I love guys that are innovators and
you know, there's all kinds of people.

341
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,570
There's always going to be
someone that's a naysayer.

342
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,490
I look at Eddie Bravo
and go, man, you are,

343
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,710
you're the guy who, you know, and he,

344
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:45,450
you say perfect all the time where
he's got a, his Ninja, the Ninja Geeks,

345
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,010
you know,
all these guys that are just geeky guys

346
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,570
at are killers in Jujitsu now.
They're nerd assassins.

347
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,500
Exactly what you, and it's
the truth. Yeah. But Eddie's,

348
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,490
that guy that he's calm,

349
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,670
he looked at things just different
than other guys and how can I do this

350
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:03,590
different?
And that's how Jujitsu started for,

351
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:07,360
as far as Brazilian Jujitsu with
Leo. Sure. Hickson was the guy.

352
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:12,310
He was so basic as far as what he did,
but he was so precise.

353
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,820
His ability to create a pressure and the
only guy that I've seen do it sometimes

354
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,420
the same way as Damien
Maia. Yeah. You know,

355
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:26,670
it was Hixon could create a pressure that
was just like where the what is on top

356
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:29,700
of it. And when you
say basic, here's like,

357
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,860
some people think that's an
insult like no, remember,

358
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,040
but Vinnie McCullough has said that about
Minataro says Jiu Jitsu is very basic

359
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,530
and,
and got really upset and I wouldn't eat,

360
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,710
I wouldn't say that that is inaccurate,

361
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,210
but it's not that Minataro is arguably
one of the greatest Jujitsu fighters of

362
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:50,530
all time as far as MMA goes. I mean,
what he did for Jujitsu when he,

363
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,050
when he armbar Bob Sapp,
I mean Holy Shit,

364
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,680
when he triangle Mark Coleman and all
those different guys that he tapped out

365
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,750
over in pride,
you got to see basic Jujitsu meaning the,

366
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:05,620
the things that everybody knows like
triangles, armbars, chokes, desert basics.

367
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,620
It doesn't mean it's like simple or dumb.
No,

368
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,450
it's a basic is actually like to have
the basics are everything and crone kicks

369
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:13,541
in.

370
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,410
Sun Crone is got that same style of you
use it but yet is a world champion with

371
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:19,420
it.
I mean there's something to be said for,

372
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,540
it's like that old Bruce Lee expression
don't fear man that knows 10,000 kicks.

373
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,570
Fear Man has practiced one kick
10,000 times. Exactly. Yeah.

374
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,160
There's something to having a precision
of those techniques that just you and

375
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:37,570
everybody knows what an arm, I mean Haji
Haji, Gracie it same thing to this day.

376
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,070
Basic basic style crushes everything you
could want and one one of my favorite

377
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:46,840
Jujitsu matches to watch is Gary
Tonin against chrome grace. Yeah.

378
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:50,500
It was part of master was holy
Shit is the difference of the more,

379
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,090
this is a guy that masters basics to
the guy that's trying all kinds of

380
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:57,910
different things now and really
going after you look at Gordon Ryan,

381
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:01,210
look at Craig Jones, look at these guys,
look at what they're doing. Yeah, that's,

382
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:03,550
this is the John Danaher effect though.

383
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,030
Like well dean lister and
then John Donahoe. You know,

384
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,010
Dean lister are saying it to John Don her,

385
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:11,130
why would you ignore 50%
of the human body? Dude,

386
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,640
he said the same thing to me at one time.
It's like Whoa, damn, why would you,

387
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,840
I never thought of that.
Yeah, and that crazy truth.

388
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,490
But isn't it crazy that like one little
statement like that can change Jujitsu?

389
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,070
Cause if you look at what's going on now,

390
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,930
like leg locks are just
out of control now.

391
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:27,890
Everybody's leg lock
in people and you want,

392
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,220
and you're watching the progression of
guys from leg locking people in Jujitsu

393
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,580
to leg locking people.
Now in MMA,

394
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,880
Dylan Dennis the other day
with that foot lock told,

395
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,640
told you watching the Nieman
Gracie he had, you watched him,

396
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,580
he's controlling both legs up. You got
a problem, right? Know he didn't get,

397
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,510
he made a mistake in it and
that's, you know, hey we can,

398
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,440
we all make a mistake and I didn't
catch that when to shit a troll.

399
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,283
Those two legs

400
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,570
see fighters not understanding
how to get themselves out.

401
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,520
And so this is, there's
your next progression. Yup.

402
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,900
You better learn that if you don't know
that you're going to be in trouble,

403
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,940
you know? And that is the
Danaher effect. He is a genius.

404
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,290
It's just fascinating
too. But you know, these,

405
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,060
these techniques that we're talking about,

406
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:17,060
like there's guys though that
can even shut those down.

407
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,360
I mean guys who have those understanding
of the basics that can shut, I mean,

408
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,410
I would really like to see hogger.
I mean, I know Hodges retiring,

409
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:27,530
which is unfortunate. I mean
fortunate and unfortunate. I get it.

410
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,820
He's arguably one of the greatest rappers
of all time without a doubt. Yeah.

411
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,330
And uh, I would like to see him
though against like a Gordon. Ryan,

412
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,170
wouldn't you want to see that? Like of
course. I mean they're both big guys.

413
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,910
They're both very strong and Hodgett
with that extreme basic game.

414
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,970
The old school. So are you going to
say would win it? I would never say no.

415
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,750
Fuck knows. I want to ask it. That's
the whole point. That's why you look at,

416
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,000
and you get all these all so, and would
wait. Oh, you know what? That's why you,

417
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,940
that's why I always liked lock guys that
went and trained with Braulio esteem

418
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:02,960
steamer and he shut that shit down and
they were like, whoa. And they were like,

419
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:03,980
okay,
there's something,

420
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,750
there's something to be said for that
intense pressures style, that solid,

421
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,670
get those things that you used to do.

422
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,300
That's where I'm really interested
in with look it, you know,

423
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,070
people don't realize how good Rafael
Lovato Junior, oh, how could you not? Oh,

424
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,170
how could you not?

425
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,360
Cause they're not guys that
actually live in the Jujitsu world.

426
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:24,680
They live only in the MMA world.

427
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:28,000
And he fights for Bella to where
he can't be any good. And you know,

428
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,100
he's one of the best in the
world. Oh my God. You know,

429
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,440
and Gerald Harris is a tough
guy. Oh, he's a tough guy.

430
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,870
Cheryl Harris is very strong,
very good wrestler.

431
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,830
He was 25 and he's now 25 and six. Look
at, he has beaten some good people.

432
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:44,831
He's got four slam Kaos is a monster
in certain areas of the fight.

433
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:46,340
And you look and you go,

434
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:52,040
that was the way that Rothfield
switched that arm. And the w and the,

435
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,470
just the control of the lights. Cause
you see the leg, his head's getting up,

436
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,210
he brings that you can look and you go
to have, you realize how good that is.

437
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,390
Yeah. Well for a guy like you as a
black belt in Jujitsu, you see that?

438
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:05,640
That's like you're watching
an art. It is art and, and,

439
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,200
and I tell people all the time, look at,
yeah I can. I used to be able to roll.

440
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,440
I can roll with that guy.
That dude is world class.

441
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,730
There's a level of like, I was trying
to explain this to someone who's like,

442
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:19,640
well you're a black belt too. I'm like,
that guy would treat me like a white belt.

443
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,700
Like I'm a blue belt.
Like I'm just a beginner.

444
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,940
There's lots of fat and that's
the whole town. It's like,

445
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:30,060
why are you going to sit there and try
it so I could roll it. No, there's facts.

446
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,520
Like if you don't know
Jujitsu and you're my size,

447
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,040
I'm going to choke the shit out.
You're going to crush a chance.

448
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,020
But if you're a Marcello Garcia,

449
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:42,220
you could be 30 pounds lighter than me
and I'm fucked. I have zero chance. Yep.

450
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,550
You have to just say, explain. It's a
bit like you have no chance. I'm like,

451
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:48,420
listen to me. I am defending the
entire time. Yeah, I got zero chance.

452
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:52,470
I'm defending up until he gets me. It's
not a matter of if he's going to get me,

453
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:54,750
it's when is he going to get the matter?
I'm helpless.

454
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,170
When do I make that mistake that he
goes, but yeah, when you slap hands,

455
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,720
you're admitting you're a victim.
I'm a victim.

456
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,440
Just let's just try to keep me from
being a victim as long as I can.

457
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,800
There's just levels and when you roll
with a guy like John Jacques Machado or

458
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,370
you know, any high level
person, you feel that extreme.

459
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,100
That's just like the
precision and technique. It's,

460
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:19,260
it's amazing to feel and experience
because from the outside looking in,

461
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:21,840
if you don't know Jujitsu,
you can't see it. You don't,

462
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,800
you don't know what you're looking at.
That's what we,

463
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,720
it's like when you say you're John,
John, you feel from the moment you start,

464
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,270
I'm in danger. Yeah, there's no,

465
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,120
and then finally you'll get to the
point where you can go, you can lock in,

466
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:37,530
you can pinch down and people are like,
what? We'll do something. It's like, dude,

467
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,120
I am doing stuff.
I have survivor.

468
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,050
I had dinner with Hixon
once and Hickson and crone.

469
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:45,210
And then we went back to the house.
It was amazing.

470
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,070
And went back to the house and we put out,

471
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,510
he put on fights and he was breaking
down fights for me and talking about like

472
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,780
errors people were making and
he was talking about space.

473
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:56,790
That's what he kept talking about.
Look at all this space,

474
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,770
look at all this space between, oh, this,
oh, this movement to space equals a scab.

475
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,660
And then you'd watch him and there
was the Colosseum fight, you know?

476
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:09,810
And Yeah, when he fought for
[inaudible] and that was his last fight.

477
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,430
And when he fought would knock,

478
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:16,050
you see this just crushing game
where he just gets a hold. I mean,

479
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:19,260
once he's got you, you're
not, and he explained it to
me, I'll never forget this.

480
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,280
He goes, he goes, we started a neutral
point. We started zero. He goes,

481
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:25,980
and when we go to one,
we're not going back to zero.

482
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,960
We're going to two and then two, three
and then we'll shut me. She's like,

483
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:34,690
we're not going backwards. We're
going full. And you're like, Jesus,

484
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,970
I'm scared. I want to run home. Puts you.

485
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,540
You go on your watch that you
know and people don't work.

486
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,890
People don't realize how good
food knock he actually was.

487
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,850
Who knocked it was a beast.

488
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,150
He was the big test for Hixon every
and he crushed Hickson's orbital,

489
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,670
remember punch it broke.

490
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:54,260
It broke his orbital cause I mean he
was a real sort of one punch can do and

491
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,740
Funai was a real threat and hips and
put him to snarky was a guy as far as

492
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:00,990
grappling in Japan,
he,

493
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,500
you can go on and again it's
that size thing because he was,

494
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:09,590
he was a good size 200 and
plus 10 to 15 pounds jacked,

495
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:12,990
jacked and a good grappler who,
you know,

496
00:29:12,991 --> 00:29:15,540
you can go back and look at all the
guys from the past and you know,

497
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:19,230
the Satos and everybody that
were phenomenal, they all said,

498
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:20,190
well no one can beat him.

499
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,790
He was that good Hixon to steroid
just once it hit the ground yet.

500
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,813
But that's like,

501
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,920
it was almost like I was talking with
Jay Glazer before the Dillon data's fight

502
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,960
know I'm Dylan is in is, you know,
this is his first fight. And yes,

503
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:37,170
he's saying a lot of
stuff. I love that. Hey,

504
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:40,200
you got to have confidence in yourself.
Okay. And you've got to put it out there.

505
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:42,010
But you know, Jay has asked me, he

506
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,800
says, he goes, what can I
say? I said, look at, this is
what you can say about him.

507
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,870
It is his first fight.
I go,

508
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:51,640
but if he gets his hands around
his opponent and they do this,

509
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,730
it's over. He will not get out.
His opponent will not survive.

510
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,860
He is that good on the ground.
And you know, it's, uh, it's,

511
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:09,010
it's so hard to get people to
realize how good certain people are,

512
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,440
you know? And just there, you know,

513
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,740
obviously if you get hit and your
brain's not working because your brain is

514
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:17,950
everything that can be taken
away to a point from you.

515
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,300
But if your brain is there and
you have that submission ability,

516
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,530
you're always dangerous.

517
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,490
Yeah. It's, uh, it's just, it's to me,

518
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,520
the most enjoyable thing to watch because
it's so complex because there's so

519
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:37,060
many variables and it's so interesting,
so much going on in a fight.

520
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:40,270
There's just so much happening,
so many possibilities, you know?

521
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,420
And for you as a referee,
I mean, you've had, I mean,

522
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:47,410
I always say I had the best seat in the
house next to you, cause I did. I mean,

523
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:51,020
you've got to sit down. We'll be,
it's better you could get around me.

524
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,890
You can look at all the best
places from a foot away. I mean,

525
00:30:55,891 --> 00:31:00,310
you were, you were there for all of it,
man. You got to be there. Well, I mean,

526
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,990
do you the only one,

527
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,800
really the only one that truly experienced
those fights without some sort of a

528
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:06,850
barrier in between them.

529
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,390
True. I'm going to go back real quick
for you. Okay. So it, so it goes,

530
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,330
how did Hixon not get to fight in UFC one?

531
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,120
That was the question. We didn't
answer the question. Yeah.

532
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:20,000
So we have two questions to answer this.
12 to six elbow,

533
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:26,000
but let's go to this. Why, why
wasn't Hixon? Because Hixon was the,

534
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,040
the champion of the family.
Oh, no. Dot. By far. Any,

535
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,060
even back then hoist came
out in articles and said,

536
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:35,150
my brother Hixon is 10 times better than
me. Oh, always said that he wasn't lying.

537
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,720
He said, I will go to train tonight and
my brother would tap me a hundred times.

538
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,190
You, you're so good at them. But

539
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,110
what truly happened was,
again, I, and I say,

540
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,920
look at the first UFC for Horian
horian looked at this entire thing.

541
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,270
People have to understand how whore,
how much time Horian had spent.

542
00:31:54,271 --> 00:31:59,271
Trying to get people to understand
grappling is an art form.

543
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,910
That taking somebody down and putting
them into a place where they are unaware

544
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:07,390
of what can happen to them.
You know,

545
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:10,440
unknowledgeable is a way for
you to be safe in a fight,

546
00:32:10,441 --> 00:32:14,490
taking kinetic energy off of their plate
and putting you in a place where you

547
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:18,510
could do what you do. And he was
trying to sell this the whole time.

548
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,000
Then he meets Art Davy or Davies,

549
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:24,750
the one that helps put together the
Gracie in action tapes and through that

550
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:29,460
marketing scheme Horry and sees this guy
can make me money. And so then he does,

551
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,620
he says, okay, look, what are you
talking about with your fighting thing?

552
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,710
And no doubt Hixon is the
best one in the family,

553
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:38,430
but Hixon at that time is
training people out of Torrance.

554
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,010
And then he opens

555
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,180
up his own studio in west La. He go, yes.

556
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,880
And when he opened up his, his studio
in west La Hora and went, what,

557
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,400
you're not going to I,

558
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,200
the person that is going to be fighting
in this is going to be representing my

559
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:56,780
school.
And that's how hoists got it.

560
00:32:56,781 --> 00:33:00,970
And so that was always the rumors that
he couldn't control Hixon couldn't. Yeah.

561
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,320
The other rumor was there was two rumors,

562
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:06,830
one that you couldn't control Hickson
and the other one was that Hickson was

563
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:11,810
like physically very impressive
and that they, that's such a lot.

564
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,960
This is a lie. It's a lie. And
let me just go ahead a sentence.

565
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,630
The sentence was that because
he was physically impressive,

566
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:22,070
it wouldn't be as good an advertisement
for Jujitsu because hoist was like long

567
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:26,320
and thin and he wasn't like the typical
but Hickson when you looked at him like

568
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,360
with his shirt off,
I mean a six pack and big muscles.

569
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,760
He looked like a
physically impressive guy.

570
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:35,270
But Pixton was 100 he was 10 pounds
heavier than hoists. Yeah. Okay.

571
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,290
Little bit shorter. Yeah, shorter than
hoist. But he would've worn the, you know,

572
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,890
if he would have worn the g, what are
you going to see anyways? Right. Nothing.

573
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:47,390
Okay. It looks, you know,
guidance g and you know,

574
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,240
that whole thing of Horian
marketing wise said,

575
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:53,120
oh it was because Hixon is
this big guy and you know,

576
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:56,510
I wanted to more insane
when he came out with that.

577
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,330
So he said that just because he needed
an excuse for why he couldn't control his

578
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:04,300
accent. Yup. So us as
Jujitsu practitioners, I,

579
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:07,430
I started doing Jujitsu in
[inaudible] 96 with Hixon.

580
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:12,650
I started Hixon school on Pico.
Yeah. Louis Heredia my first class.

581
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,590
And uh,
but then I took a couple classes there,

582
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:18,980
but then I found out the cross in Glee
Gracie's was closer to my house in La.

583
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,350
I didn't know Jack Shit.
No, it, his was, yeah,

584
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:26,000
his was on a hawthorn right off
of a write off of La Cienega. Oh.

585
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:28,340
So it was right down the street from
the comedy store. So it was like, well,

586
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:31,400
this is like near where I live this
way. And I was like, Gracie is Gracie.

587
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:33,590
I didn't know there was any difference
between the two of them. And then I,

588
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:37,730
and Carlson Gracie was always on a John
Perretti show when John Perretti had

589
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:40,130
that extreme was extreme
combat or challenge extremes,

590
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:43,370
challenge battle Cade battle
Kate. Right. And so I said,

591
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:44,540
well I'll just go train here.

592
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,410
So I stopped training with literally
the greatest of all time, you know,

593
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:49,340
cause I didn't know any better.

594
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,400
But you went to training with the
guy that would hold nothing back.

595
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:00,110
Everything. Well also I went there
while v Tor was still victor.

596
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,550
Yeah, he was Victor Gracie. They
called him Victor Gracie. In fact,

597
00:35:04,551 --> 00:35:05,600
like when I first interviewed,

598
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:09,290
I called him victor a couple times because
we had always called him victor and

599
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,490
they were calling a victor Gracie,

600
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:15,050
but he was getting sued by Horian was
saying that you can't use the Gracie name.

601
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:18,890
And so he had to stop calling himself
Gracie and he was going with Belfort and

602
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:21,350
Mario Sperry was there.
There was like,

603
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,590
I mean that was a Carlos
by Hato was there. Yeah.

604
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,560
But it was a fucking crazy place to be.

605
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,610
If you think about the history of
Jujitsu and MMA, I mean it was,

606
00:35:31,611 --> 00:35:36,560
it was an amazing time to, have you ever
been to his original school in Rio? No.

607
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:41,170
No. And I'm God man. I, it's like you
look at, it's a dungeon. It's ups.

608
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,750
It's an upstairs dungeon. But I
mean you look and you go, oh my God,

609
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:49,740
all these guys learn in. It's, it's,
it's a room. It's actually this size,

610
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,600
this size right here.

611
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:56,601
And you think about the guys that he
had there and one retired army but Tesh,

612
00:35:56,981 --> 00:35:59,460
a Carter Laborio by head toe.

613
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,500
Alan goes all these guys and you go man,

614
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:06,990
that and the one thing out of all of them,
cause you know,

615
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,610
I'm at least I've been lucky enough to
be able to know all of them and talk to

616
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:16,500
him and train with a lot of women.
All of them would man Carlson, Gracie,

617
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:20,100
I love him. He's my father. He
never held anything back from me.

618
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,660
And you've got to look and you go.

619
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,370
That was the thing because I remember I
had some friends that went to Torrance

620
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,940
and right after hoists tapped
out Dan seven with a triangle.

621
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,610
They wanted to learn the triangle
and they were saying, no,

622
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:35,470
you're not ready for that yet.
You're not ready for that already.

623
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,160
And Mario Sperry was teaching
us like right off the bat,

624
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,050
oh Mario Sperry's explaining,

625
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:42,810
I'll never forget this is explaining how
it used to practice triangles with his

626
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:43,560
girlfriend.

627
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,640
He's making his girlfriend sit there
and he would just rotate on or just left

628
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:49,260
triangle, right triangle, left triangle,

629
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:51,510
right track and he would
just practice on it.

630
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,130
That's a good relationship right there.
While I was a good woman, I tell you,

631
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,190
because my wife would go, fuck you. Yeah,

632
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,770
good woman looks just sync up trying a
lot of over and over and over again. Yeah.

633
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,510
You know, he would just rotate
his hips if he's saying,

634
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:08,970
if you can get someone that's the
best way to work in your triangle.

635
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,320
He was saying,
if you can get someone,

636
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:13,290
it's really just about doing those numbers
over and over and over and over again.

637
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,270
So he was teaching us
that right off the bat.

638
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:19,470
So that that is a thing about Carlson.
But you crossed that place went under,

639
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,820
went under somewhere around 98 and that's
when I moved over to John Jock and I

640
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:27,440
started training John Jackson since 98
you didn't miss a beat there though. No.

641
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,540
So got lucky too.
At the time I,

642
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,500
I had just started to understand
who John Jock was and,

643
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,660
but everybody wanted that Gracie name,

644
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,700
which is why you know a lot of guys
went with Gracie as their last name,

645
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:44,160
even though it wasn't a last name.
Still to this day,

646
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,190
even Hodges Hodges last name.
And he said it's not his mom's last name.

647
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:51,220
Same with Neiman. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You
don't even, his last name is strong.

648
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,160
Belsky oh,
what's wrong with that?

649
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:58,890
It's weird that that's still last name,
but his mom comes from the grassy side.

650
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:03,390
That's crazy that you mean the dad must
be like, what in the fuck? It's my name.

651
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,990
What's my name, kid. Um, that
was, that was always a thing.

652
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:10,950
But then I started to understand
Jiu Jitsu. Then, you know,

653
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:14,970
I'd been doing it for a little while
and then everybody had heard about John

654
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,150
John Machado and he can Machado
and the brothers and John.

655
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:22,020
And it was one of those than
hydro. And we knew that, okay,

656
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,830
this is another family that's also
like an elite world class family.

657
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:28,030
And then we started training and there
was people saying at the time of all the

658
00:38:28,031 --> 00:38:31,980
materials aren't as good as a Gracie. So
you go, Oh yes they are. They're the same.

659
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,250
Well there was, there's just
high level, right? Yeah.

660
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:39,550
There's so much of it today.
And John Joc is the guy,

661
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,240
you look at all of them cause you know,
if you're going to go on you,

662
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:43,871
you're going to say,

663
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:48,610
well who was the best if they
train between each other,

664
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,420
it was Hagan.
He was a monster because he was so big,

665
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:55,540
so strong and his Jujitsu
was really fricking good.

666
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,520
Well there's a great match for
Jean Hagen and Hixon. Absolutely.

667
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,630
Watch black and white. Yeah.
Can Wild Shit from, you know,

668
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,620
and he can doing good
for a lot of that sucker.

669
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:10,621
But you look at the guy that technically
how just different he was in the red,

670
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,150
it was John Jock.

671
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,870
Well one of the things is that John Jack
was born with a deformity where he only

672
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:20,470
has a thumb on one hand but that's
lefthand, doesn't have any fingers.

673
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,640
So because of that,

674
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:25,960
a lot of people credit John Joc with a
lot of the over hooks and under hooks

675
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:28,870
that really tend to
dominate no geek grappling.

676
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,870
Cause John Jack was not grabbing
the g with that left hand.

677
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,760
Look at him when in ADCC. Yes. What he's
doing and look what he can't grab in the,

678
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,260
but he was taken and putting his hands
in ways and you look and you go, it is,

679
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,520
look at what he's doing.

680
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,390
All of those holds that he's grabbing
and controlling that person with that

681
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:48,730
instead of the g.
That's what we use today.

682
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,120
Well that's where Eddie learned a lot
of his technique. Let Eddie, you know,

683
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,880
obviously at,
he's a black belt under the John Jack,

684
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:59,200
but he learned a lot of
his Nogi principles from
John John Because John Jack

685
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,080
couldn't rely on the gate and that's
what we always talked about this.

686
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:05,290
One of the things that happens to these
gay guys when they come over to MMA,

687
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:09,640
if they rely too much on the Guid,
they, they have like half their game,

688
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,820
like maybe half the game. It's one
of those things that, you know,

689
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:15,930
back in the day it was always
all you must train in the key.

690
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:20,890
You gotta train the gate. Bullshit.
It's not true. Absolutely not. Say this.

691
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:22,930
He's like, if you want to get good
at tennis, do you play racquetball?

692
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,380
Well then it's exactly, yeah, and this is
the point when I talk about Eddie, I go,

693
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,860
you know, Eddie was saying that
long before anybody else. He's like,

694
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,560
I don't believe that you have to do
train the gear. You have to train.

695
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,630
And it's like, oh no, to learn these.

696
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,480
And it's like most of those don't
work if they're not wearing the right.

697
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,320
There's some,

698
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,800
there's some things about the
[inaudible] that are really good defense.

699
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,870
You have to have real
defense with the gate.

700
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:46,390
You have to really understand is that
you can't just muscle out of shit.

701
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,420
Well that's the big difference is the
geeky takes away that explosion blowgun

702
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:56,860
and power and slippery makes you
technically have to do it. Yes. Yes.

703
00:40:56,861 --> 00:41:00,760
There's definitely benefits to the goal.
Yeah. And it's also great for old guys.

704
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,820
You can grab a hold of shit and cling
and hang on and that's all you do. You,

705
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:10,360
you have some serious neck injuries.
Right. And you're all fused up now, right?

706
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,810
I'm a mess. What did, what'd
they do to you all about?

707
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,540
I'm me say four years ago I had
two disc replace because I, uh,

708
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,811
it was actually,

709
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:24,811
the dis was broken and it was pressing
in on my spinal cord and I had only like

710
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:30,460
about it. Eighth of an inch. Between
the touching the other side. No, no, no.

711
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,070
My spinal cord touching the other side,
which would have been

712
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,930
me going kitchen falling
down and not getting back up.
Whoa. So they took an they,

713
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:40,580
uh,
they relieve the pressure,

714
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:45,581
took that out and put two fake disc and
put this cage around it to a cause I

715
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:49,910
didn't want to be fused. I
was panicked about, I look at,

716
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:53,060
I need to be able to move my neck,
you know, even for refereeing,

717
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:54,890
it was even more past the Jujitsu,

718
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:59,870
but I want her to still be
able to do things and rolling
and stuff. And then, uh,

719
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,100
I got hurt in July of
last year bat and it was,

720
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,710
I wasn't like son, you know,
someone meant to do it.

721
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:11,180
I was training somebody and having
them put a Darce choke on me.

722
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:14,190
It was no big deal, but they were
doing it wrong as I'm watching him.

723
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,130
So I get down and said, look and put
it on me. Okay, here, put this here.

724
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:19,970
I don't know. I want you to wait here.
All right. Start putting pressure to,

725
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:24,500
and I was probably in it for 90 seconds
because I'm talking through it and you

726
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:27,260
know, and I'm waiting for them to
increase the pressure increase in,

727
00:42:27,261 --> 00:42:30,380
make it tighter. And finally it gets
to where, hey, it's tight. Okay.

728
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,480
And I tapped him and he said,
good. All right, you got it.

729
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,710
And I didn't feel anything,

730
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,280
but that broke the five through seven
in my disc and pushed him out the next

731
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,400
day. I had, he didn't feel it while
it was happening. Did not feel it.

732
00:42:43,401 --> 00:42:46,130
When it happens. Scary shit
about neck injury. It is.

733
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,160
It's like you don't think you really
had an injury because you're like,

734
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:51,680
I don't remember anything happening.
There was no pain.

735
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:56,780
I can re I remember cracking when they're
putting it on it because my neck is,

736
00:42:56,781 --> 00:42:59,750
you know, getting, but that's normal
in a, yeah. And so it was like,

737
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,480
that's no big deal. Right.
You're used to it. And men,

738
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:07,481
the next day I had this fire going down
my arm into my fingers that didn't stop.

739
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,850
And it was like, holy, I mean
pain. Oh yeah. And I mean,

740
00:43:13,851 --> 00:43:14,720
it was,

741
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,680
if you've ever had a stinger from football
or smashing your head into something

742
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:22,910
and you get that fire, that goes down. And
it did not, I mean, I, from that point,

743
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:25,340
I didn't sleep.
I was in trouble.

744
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:29,540
I ended up going and I go in and
they say, ah, you've crushed this.

745
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,880
And so then they went and looked and when
they were supposed to do the surgery,

746
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:37,580
they were going to fuse from five to
seven. I said, all right, whatever.

747
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:42,940
And they do that. Well, my body itself
fused around the cage. He's that.

748
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,920
They'd put the disc in.
So I'm fused from three down to seven now.

749
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,870
So it's all good. I can move a little
bit. I can, I can't remember back.

750
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,800
I can, I can turn it to the sides of
the aisle so I'm good. And so three,

751
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:58,330
where's that start? It starts at the
neck at the top of the head. Right.

752
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,660
Just to down off of the where
your head and your neck attach.

753
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,820
They're doing a lot of
those artificial discs.

754
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:09,440
Eddie's got one now and he's got an
artificial titanium moving disc. Yeah,

755
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:11,990
I got to his lower back. You
got those two? I got those.

756
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,570
And those wrapped up in the cage or,
and it's wrapped up in that cage,

757
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:15,590
which is now fused.

758
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,590
So they're not doing anything except
they're keeping me from getting shorter

759
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:22,310
again. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Eddie gained
an inch there. You go in at five,

760
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:25,500
eight to five nine you will, it's not bad
cause man, I'll tell you what, you know,

761
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,950
it's everything with grappling and
Jujitsu smushes those militias you get.

762
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,070
I've gotten,
I've gotten

763
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,560
a lot shorter. Yeah,
it's, it's definitely,

764
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:38,190
and people will say things
like disc degeneration,
disease. I'm like, slow down.

765
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,140
You're getting injured.
Okay.

766
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:42,540
You're getting injured over and over
and over again and your district getting

767
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:43,171
compressed.

768
00:44:43,171 --> 00:44:46,980
And it's not a coincidence that this disc
degenerating disease is happening with

769
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:48,600
grapplers in the exact same spots,

770
00:44:48,601 --> 00:44:52,000
lower back and the neck and it's
all from getting cranked on it.

771
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,640
It's from getting good team Darst and
fighting your way out of chokes and from

772
00:44:56,641 --> 00:45:00,480
your lower back from being in the guard.
And there's just so much going on.

773
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,990
There's so much going on with your back.

774
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:08,760
And very few people do anything
to strengthen their back.

775
00:45:08,761 --> 00:45:11,820
I implore people that are doing Jujitsu.
I want you to look at two things,

776
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,800
three things. One, the
reverse hyper machine. That's
that Louie Simmons machine.

777
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:21,470
I'm sure you know about that. That
fucking thing is so good. Dr Neil Riordan,

778
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,810
the stem cell doctor that I had on before,
he was having some back issues.

779
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,630
He just sent me a picture of uh,

780
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,940
the one of them that he has now and his
place after he came here and saw mine,

781
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,910
he got one of those reverse hypers
put it in his office. He's like,

782
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:36,270
Jesus Christ is things changed my
body. It's like changed my back. It's,

783
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:38,970
it's helped me so much. It's
incredible. That thing's amazing.

784
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,300
And then there's a thing called
the iron neck. The iron neck,

785
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,880
which is just a phenomenal
training tool for your neck,

786
00:45:44,881 --> 00:45:48,480
gives you more range of motion
and strengthens your neck.

787
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,740
So many guys just don't do that. You
just train, you just always train.

788
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,800
You got to treat your body
like it's like you are,

789
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,100
you're in the pit stop and you're
in a fucking NASCAR crew, you know,

790
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:02,280
and you've got to fix stuff and replace
stuff and make sure everything's tuned

791
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:05,730
up and tighten up and three your body.
Like you got to strengthen all that shit.

792
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,150
Question where you were you that way when
you were 25 though. That was a retard.

793
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,090
There you go. This man stand still.
I can't believe how stupid I am.

794
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:13,290
That's amazing.
I've gotten so far.

795
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,360
That's the differences when you know I
don't care if you think you're vulnerable,

796
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,310
you're absolutely,
no one can do anything to you.

797
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,570
You know you can't be beat you a,
you can put up with anything. Yup.

798
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,010
And you get into your oldest,
go fuck it. Who Cares?

799
00:46:29,011 --> 00:46:31,950
I'll just train the other side.
I'll just saw, I'll go light.

800
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:34,830
And you never go like, yeah. And then
you wind up having all these injuries.

801
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:36,630
It never really healed
themselves and they're like,

802
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:39,630
one of the best things that ever happened
to me training was something actually

803
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:42,450
breaking.
Like I'd have an actual torn ACL.

804
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:45,090
Well now I can't train
for six months for sure.

805
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,930
So now it gives everything a chance
to recuperate and actually heal.

806
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,380
And Like I look, my elbow
doesn't hurt anymore. I was like,

807
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,920
there's all these things.
Like I went,

808
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,100
I told you I got stem cell shots
in my shoulder. The guy goes,

809
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,550
you had a shoulder separation at
some point in time. I'm like, really?

810
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,080
I don't even know. No,
because he gets hurt so much

811
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,360
cranking you in an Americana or whatever
and you're wanting your app and the

812
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,350
next day you're back in there
again and it's, you're sure know,

813
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,750
you sure it's sore,

814
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,920
but you don't know what it is and you
just average after awhile I didn't know

815
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:19,680
you store your Achilles
tendon. I did that. I didn't
care my tendon. Oh, good ACL.

816
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:24,120
Why'd you say I told my tendon or the
sick for whatever reason. You said ACL?

817
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,720
Yeah. Achilles tendon. No, no, no,
no. That sucks. But the Achilles,

818
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:29,590
now one of the girls
that works with Heather,

819
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:32,740
she had it done and they fixed it so fast.

820
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,630
They reattach it to the
bone now and you're walking
around like immediately real.

821
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:41,530
It's fucking crazy. That's not the
way it was when it's like six months.

822
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:45,610
Let's more thing. Right. Horrible this
year. But that no one else is crazy now.

823
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,170
BICEP tendon tears. Jeff
Dubitsky, the u s you Usada Guy,

824
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,470
he had his bicep tendon torn.
They replaced that shit.

825
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:57,940
They did bolted that shit down to the
arm and he was moving around like normal

826
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,520
within a couple of days.
Wow.

827
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,250
It's like he doesn't have
any strengthening while the
rebuild his strength back,

828
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:07,210
but it used to be you are in a fucking
cast and you couldn't do shit and it took

829
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:10,990
forever to rehab and it was awesome.
Now it's like they just bolt things down.

830
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:15,450
There's, there's new techniques now
where they can um, Doctor Rati Mcgann,

831
00:48:15,451 --> 00:48:18,700
a Vegas was explained to me
when you tear an ACL in half,

832
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:23,740
instead of replacing the ACL,
now they put that ACL back together again.

833
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,960
They have new techniques of tying
the ACL back together, going to,

834
00:48:26,961 --> 00:48:31,630
it heals up fully and they've had guys
go back into the Olympics within four

835
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:36,400
months of this surgery. Like
what in the fuck. Exactly.

836
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:37,503
This,

837
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:41,410
we're going to crazy time when it comes
to regeneration and the ability to fix

838
00:48:41,411 --> 00:48:42,550
things,
repair things.

839
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:45,760
They're constantly innovating and
coming up with new surgical procedures.

840
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:50,410
So awesome time to get fucked up. Oh
yeah. I've done a great job of that.

841
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,500
You know that my thing, I
got to the point, it it,

842
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:58,420
it actually atrophied me so
bad. Yeah. I mean, I was like,

843
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,690
and my wife would look, she'd go
every day she goes, oh my God.

844
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,880
You know my shoulders like I had,

845
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:06,550
they were concave in the
back where you are a giant.

846
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:08,110
When I met you when I first met you,

847
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:11,200
you had been doing a lot of
power lifting and you were three.

848
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:14,980
What will you three how much
you weigh? Three. 10, three
10. You were fucking huge.

849
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:19,300
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Not
Anymore. Do you roll anymore?

850
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,220
I have not rolled since July. Since
that injury and said I'm done. No,

851
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:28,810
my wife, she's hearing she's in the other
room. She's going to knock on the door.

852
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:33,340
You're done. Motherfucker was, she'll
say, you can roll with the black belt. Oh,

853
00:49:33,341 --> 00:49:36,750
okay. She doesn't want me
rolling with people that go
spastic. Right, right, right.

854
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:41,340
That makes sense. Yeah. Do you, so
you're able to work out though slow.

855
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,310
It was a point I, I'd have to
pick up my arm to put it up here.

856
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,140
Pat Miletich was here. Oh, same thing.

857
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,970
And Pass Rutan Pat has his
discs fused on their own.

858
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,890
That's where minded around
the, uh, around the cage bone.

859
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:58,780
Pat didn't even do it around a cage paths.
Neck was so fucked up.

860
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:01,330
There was no disc left at the
bones just grew into each other.

861
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,590
I remember when pat had, he fought
you remember back a long time ago.

862
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:08,410
Jose Paly Landy. John's. Oh yeah. And he,

863
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:13,890
he had to stop in the fight because
Jose was grabbing a hold of a Moyie Thai

864
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:20,911
plum and it was killing Pat's neck
because his neck was just jacked and he

865
00:50:21,641 --> 00:50:24,370
couldn't finally gets to the point.
He was like, I can't do it anymore.

866
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,180
And it was all based on
injuries. Yeah. Yeah.

867
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,200
He wasn't getting beaten the fight by
what was happening by the fighter hurting

868
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:36,110
him.
It was just someone hanging on his neck.

869
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,910
Cause all I know a lot of guys have
gotten the neck really fucked up from can

870
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:44,960
openers, tell me about it.
It can offer. It's just that,

871
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,030
that technique of opening up the guard.

872
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,730
Well Tim could Tafoya was the
one that really started Oh yeah.

873
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,590
Out The can opener. And it was Mark
Kerr and Mark Coleman. Oh yeah.

874
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:59,120
That guy was a fucking gorilla.
A big old gray haired gray haired girl.

875
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,420
He looked like a silver badge.
They gray. Oh yeah. So he like,

876
00:51:02,421 --> 00:51:07,310
he had great chest hairs and a crazy gray
mustache and built like a fucking tank.

877
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:11,810
He was just yanking on things. He
wasn't taking anything. Yeah. Yeah.

878
00:51:11,811 --> 00:51:16,520
He was yanking on shit. But Coleman
and incur that was there. Yup. Call.

879
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:20,810
I remember curt fuck somebody up in pride.
Some a Russian cat. Oh wait a minute.

880
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:25,730
Can Open and fucked his neck up. And
when that was Bronco? Yes, that's right.

881
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,120
Was it him? Yeah. Well that was the first
one that he did. And then he had, um,

882
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,780
he was a Russian guy. Trying to think
of who that, I forget the guy's name,

883
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:36,680
but I remember the guys writhing in
agony holding onto his neck and I'm,

884
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:40,460
I'm thinking fuck that. And that
was the smashing machine, Kurt,

885
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:43,160
that was car when he was on
all the Mexican supplements.

886
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:48,080
He was on everything they ever
invented in labs. Whose job? Well,

887
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:50,840
I can tell you about it now. I
rolled with it. I was rolling with,

888
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,910
why would you roll with Kirk?
Did you roll with, I did not.

889
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:56,420
I never rode with marker, but I
rolled with Mark Coleman. Ah, Jesus,

890
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,050
that's not better Kevin.
Randleman oh my God.

891
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,920
It was funny though, cause with
first we were trying to, Oh hey,

892
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:06,640
we'll just roll in the on. Right. And
then it was willing to, you know, hey,

893
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,570
I've been working on this
defense that's not going to work.

894
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:10,490
And he actually told me,
Pat Pat took,

895
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,310
pat military told me that he didn't teach
it that way. Dude, I'm just telling you,

896
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,890
you know,
and it was triangle defense.

897
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,560
He cause he's fighting in pride and
he's getting triangled by Totoro.

898
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:24,740
But he would sit there and he put
his hand to his forehead. Oh, Jesus.

899
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:29,741
But he was the strongest human
being I had ever rolled with.

900
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,630
He changed a lot of people's games.
People don't realize.

901
00:52:32,631 --> 00:52:34,460
Like when Mark Coleman came into the game,

902
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,430
like with Mark Coleman beat Dan Severen,
um,

903
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,360
and just got him in that scarf
hold and cranked on his neck.

904
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:45,980
When people saw what mark was doing to
people, everybody got bigger. Everybody.

905
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:47,900
That was when [inaudible]
went up to like two 40.

906
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:52,810
Oh that everybody got bigger because they
were just saying in one day I'm going

907
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:56,380
to have to fight that fucking
gorilla. Like I got to get that. Gee,

908
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:59,780
I just got to get at least 40
pounds bigger. I love mark.

909
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,070
At a certain point he hated
me because, you know, look,
I changed the rules on him.

910
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:07,170
It was me, the headbutts cause
you, you change the headbutts.

911
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:11,750
See I like head butts. I think there are
four lie for him. They were very fast.

912
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:15,020
Oh my God. He would, he would take
you down. Guys would grab over,

913
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:16,550
hook his arms and he would just,

914
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:20,420
he would use that big old
Mellon to just wish him.

915
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:25,010
But the crazy thing is when Maury Smith
beat Mark Hollmann headbutts were legal.

916
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,280
Yes they were.
They were legal

917
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,270
back then. Our last one. Still
one. That was the last last show.

918
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,690
That's why I'm in favor of headbutts.
It's like there's a defense for them.

919
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:37,190
You can do it. You can figure it out
and Maurice figured it out, but it's,

920
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:42,230
it's perception and that's what the
entire sport has fought for its entire

921
00:53:43,411 --> 00:53:46,080
existence. Well, let me tell you this
because I'm beating a dead horse in this.

922
00:53:46,081 --> 00:53:48,270
Everybody listens to this podcast
knows I don't like gloves.

923
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,850
I don't think guys should have to
wear gloves because I don't think.

924
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:52,680
Tell me why you don't like
clubs because I think,

925
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:55,920
why should you have padding on your
knuckles that makes your knuckles more

926
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:59,100
effective when you don't have it on your
shins? You don't have it on your elbows.

927
00:53:59,101 --> 00:54:02,070
You don't have it on your knees. Right?
It doesn't make any sense. Your heel,

928
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,040
your heel is one of the hardest
parts of your fucking body.

929
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:09,210
You mean everybody's seen Edson Barboza,
Terry, Adam. Fuck that perception.

930
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:13,210
How is it okay to Shin somebody in
the head? This is the perception.

931
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,290
It's the reality informed
back. Okay, let's go back.

932
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:19,560
We're going back all the way to UFC.
The way back machine.

933
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:23,970
UFC eight was the first time that
I ended up in court before UFCA.

934
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:28,470
Okay. Because John Mccain had come out
with this whole thing and everyone can sit

935
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:33,240
there and say why John did it. No
Budweiser. Oh my, thank you very much.

936
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,880
You hit it right on the wiser
was sponsoring boxing mango.

937
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,190
I hear all the stories. We'll all
know John Mccain did us a favor will.

938
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:44,130
You weren't there at that time.
He didn't do us any. Damn.

939
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,940
They brought him in because they knew
that they needed someone who is very

940
00:54:47,941 --> 00:54:52,760
respected to be against MMA. Exactly. You
gotta got to look at the paper reviews.

941
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:56,400
The very first paper view
for the UFC 87,000 buys.

942
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,760
They were hoping for a home run it around
25 they got 87002nd one they were in

943
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:07,011
the 200 180 some thousand then
200,300 put into perspective today.

944
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,100
Sometimes I think w w who is the,

945
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:13,110
there was a fight on mighty mouse.

946
00:55:13,111 --> 00:55:16,470
There was a fight fairly recently where
mighty mouse paper view where I think it

947
00:55:16,471 --> 00:55:20,800
only got 150 you know, let's be
honest. I think probably the, the,

948
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:21,930
the last one they had,

949
00:55:21,931 --> 00:55:24,900
it's not going to be up there because
there was so much Amanda Nunez. Yeah.

950
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:26,190
Well there's so much
competition around it,

951
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:29,970
but you had a Llama Chanko fighting the
same night for free. Right. You know,

952
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:33,630
and so people look and go, ah, you know,
on this one I can still watch something.

953
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,490
And it's not that that wasn't a good card,

954
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:39,360
it's just the matter of was it the same
night as Bell Tower was built on Friday,

955
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,920
you had all those things and only one
of them you had to pay for. Yeah. Right,

956
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:47,640
exactly. But you look at all
of that man, and it's like,

957
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:51,360
it's crazy. Yeah. Crazy. What happened?

958
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:55,920
Because John Mccain comes out,
we go to court in,

959
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,760
because Puerto Rico, he sends a letter
there and they tried to shut it down.

960
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:04,761
We ended up in federal court and they
bring in this boxing expert to be on their

961
00:56:04,921 --> 00:56:09,330
side. And one of the things I did is they
had gloves and they're talking about,

962
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:12,720
we had no gloves. And I said, you know,
and I took the glove and I said, here,

963
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,500
I want to do a demonstration for
you for the, for the judge. I said,

964
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:19,980
I would like that boxing expert.
Take your hand,

965
00:56:19,981 --> 00:56:24,010
put it in that glove and I want you
to hit this desk. Hit it hard, hit it

966
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,150
as hard as you can. And he goes, crack,
take it off. Hit it just as hard now.

967
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,140
And he goes, well, I
said, this is my point.

968
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:36,070
That glove is not there
to protect my head.

969
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:40,330
It is there to protect his hand.
That is what a glove is for.

970
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:44,530
A glove does not protect someone as far
as their brain's scrambling or anything.

971
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:47,890
It is there to protect my
hands so I can punch you more.

972
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:50,470
That's what it's there for
a hundred percent okay.

973
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:55,620
And if you look and say if you want to
take away some things that go with what's

974
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:59,110
the most traumatic
injuries we have in MMA,

975
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,630
people are going to look and say
all this stuff about, oh we have,

976
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:02,650
you know guys breaking on.

977
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:06,520
Concussions are the most important
thing that we have going on.

978
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,920
That's the most critical
thing we have going on.

979
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:13,840
And if someone gets to punch less
because they have to be more precise with

980
00:57:13,841 --> 00:57:17,800
where they're doing it and be careful
as far as how many times they do do it

981
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:21,520
because they can't continue to do it.
You know, in that prolonged fashion.

982
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:25,750
Does it make it safer or is it
more dangerous for the fighters?

983
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,730
But it's a perception and it's,
you know,

984
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:31,060
this goes back to athletic commissions
and everything. It's crazy.

985
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:34,110
Has An MMA and UFC
transcendent assumption,

986
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,420
which I wish in a certain extent.
Are you kidding me?

987
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:40,870
You're still talking about
an elbow strike thing.

988
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,910
Let's go back to that cause people
don't, we never, we glossed over it.

989
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,790
I did a great segway.

990
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:49,930
There is the first time I've ever done
anyone segue to 12 six elbow strike.

991
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:54,710
Was it because this is what I've always
said and I believe you're the one who

992
00:57:54,711 --> 00:57:58,810
told me this, that when the commissions
were talking about techniques,

993
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:02,560
they had seen like those karate guys
and ESPN at one o'clock in the morning

994
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:04,700
breaking bricks with their
elbows and they like you.

995
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:08,500
Just no way you could allow that
strike because that's dry call.

996
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:11,440
It would be two deadly was that
what happened? Close, close.

997
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,120
When we talk about commissions,

998
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:18,540
there was only a couple of commissions
at the writing of the unified rules as

999
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:21,970
far as when we came, you
know, to get a degree.

1000
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,540
That was back in April of 2001 all right.

1001
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:29,860
And New Jersey and we started talking
about the UFC was not the first, you know,

1002
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,570
showing show to go there,

1003
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:36,190
but New Jersey after they had the IFC
and then the UFC and then they had a

1004
00:58:36,191 --> 00:58:37,180
couple of other small shows,

1005
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:41,440
ring of fire starts to come in
and everyone has their own rules.

1006
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:44,950
The UFC had their own rules.
IFC had their own rules during a fire,

1007
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:47,890
wants to do their own rules and New
Jersey was that we can't have these people

1008
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:51,140
coming in and giving us what
their rules are. We, if,

1009
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,720
if we're going to do this as a sport,

1010
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:57,970
we're going to do this
under our rules and okay,

1011
00:58:57,971 --> 00:59:01,390
what we're going to do is we're going
to bring people together to create those

1012
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:03,910
rules. The people that are
supposedly know what the,

1013
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:06,010
who they really invited other than,
you know,

1014
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:10,180
I think you had the Mohegan Sun as far
as the tribal commission come down and

1015
00:59:10,181 --> 00:59:11,014
they were part of it.

1016
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:15,250
New Jersey has a commission and you
had mark Ratner on a conference call.

1017
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,080
He was not there,

1018
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:21,890
but it was promoted for Ratner work for
the UFC as long before because working

1019
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,320
for the Nevada,
Nevada state athletic commission,

1020
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:28,070
he's the executive director and they
bring in all of these promoters and the

1021
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:32,960
promoters were king of the cage. Terry
trouble cock. You had Dana White,

1022
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,060
Lorenzo Fertitta, John McCarthy, Joe
Silva and Jeff Blatnick from the UFC.

1023
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:42,530
You had people from pride,
Yuki Kondo and uh,

1024
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:46,070
Kinda or whatever. And, uh, had
decade, I can't remember his name.

1025
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:49,400
And you had Paul Smith, you
had a couple, but that was it.

1026
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:50,570
That was the people there.

1027
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:56,020
And the people that we're really talking
the most were was me and a doctor named

1028
00:59:57,171 --> 00:59:59,390
Dom Coletta from New Jersey.

1029
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:03,050
He was brought in as the medical
advisor for the state of New Jersey.

1030
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,650
And when it came to elbows, they,
they, they tried to get rid of elbows.

1031
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,930
That was their big thing.
And I was,

1032
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,200
I was sitting there trying to combat
what they were saying because even in New

1033
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:18,710
Jersey at the time they had Muay Thai
and so they had elbows that were allowed

1034
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,650
in this form. I said, look it and,

1035
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:24,350
and Jeff and I had put
together a CD at the time,

1036
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,360
you know you had cds with CD Rom.
Yeah, there you go man. And uh, it was,

1037
01:00:29,361 --> 01:00:34,250
cause I knew they were going to attack
throws because that was what made Larry

1038
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:34,670
Hazard.

1039
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:38,780
You had Tito Ortiz fought Evan Tanner
and he picks him up in a body lock and he

1040
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:40,310
brings him down and he knocks him out.

1041
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,590
And Larry Hazard when his heart started
going, he's like, oh, we don't like that.

1042
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:50,080
And so I knew they were
going to attack throws and,

1043
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:55,090
and so I took with Jeff put together all
of these throws from the 1996 Olympics

1044
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,180
in Atlanta.
Here's all your throws from judo,

1045
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:00,800
here's all your throws from Greco Roman.
Right?

1046
01:01:00,801 --> 01:01:04,790
And God blessed Carolyn because he picks
people up and drop them on their head

1047
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:08,810
and it's legal. Okay. And I had all
these throws from freestyle wrestling,

1048
01:01:08,811 --> 01:01:09,680
Greco Roman wrestling,

1049
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:14,630
judo with all of these Olympic athletes
picking somebody up and then falling on

1050
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:19,490
their head being tossed on their head.
And that's what saved the throws.

1051
01:01:19,491 --> 01:01:22,340
And what we came up with was,
look,

1052
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:27,260
what we don't want is someone being
able to control another human being and

1053
01:01:27,261 --> 01:01:32,261
purposely make a 10th spike out of them
and try to drive them down onto the mat

1054
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,490
on top of their heads while driver.
Exactly.

1055
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:37,630
So Bob Sapp did two minute Tara in pride,

1056
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:42,530
pride in different set of rules
for a long time. And that's,

1057
01:01:42,531 --> 01:01:45,800
you know, maybe forever. That
was what we were looking at.

1058
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:50,210
And so that's how we came up with,
you know, no spiking and spiking.

1059
01:01:50,211 --> 01:01:54,740
I knew what it was because I worked out
the language there cause I was sitting

1060
01:01:54,741 --> 01:01:56,420
there saying well hold
on, time out. You want it.

1061
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:00,470
I'm the one that's got to come up
and say this is legal, this is not.

1062
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:05,780
So we do this. If someone takes an,
you know, a guy shoots a lazy double,

1063
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:07,880
he brings his head to the center,
picks him up,

1064
01:02:07,881 --> 01:02:09,470
his legs need to go
straight up or you know,

1065
01:02:09,471 --> 01:02:12,830
his legs were out like this
and you purposely holding
there and try to drive him

1066
01:02:12,831 --> 01:02:15,230
straight down. That's a
spike. That's illegal.

1067
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:19,950
If I take and I pick you up as a
suplex and I bring you up over the top,

1068
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:24,150
I can bring you down any as
long as there is an arc to it.

1069
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,310
Any arc makes the throw legal.

1070
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:31,490
So rampage Jackson picks up Ryan Bader
and spins him and brings him down

1071
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:36,060
straight on his head. Legal and it makes
it quick and easy for me as a referee.

1072
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:39,540
I see the arc, it's
legal. I don't see an arc.

1073
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:41,130
And I see him holding them
and bring them straight down.

1074
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,900
Now I know it's illegal and so I was
trying to make things as easy as I could

1075
01:02:45,901 --> 01:02:47,130
when it came to the elbows,

1076
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:51,420
what they were trying to do was take
away all elbows and I go, look at,

1077
01:02:51,421 --> 01:02:53,670
you have elbows in Muay Thai elbows.

1078
01:02:53,671 --> 01:02:58,671
Every time you take something away you
are changing the sport and making it to

1079
01:02:58,981 --> 01:03:03,981
where it's harder to actually have
action because you take away elbows.

1080
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:07,980
I grab her wrist and if
I'm good at grabbing wrist,

1081
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:10,890
I can hold risk for a while
and I can't do anything.

1082
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:15,510
I've got to pull my hand out where if you
grabbed my wrist and I'm Jon Jones and

1083
01:03:15,511 --> 01:03:18,360
I take an eye, roll that elbow
over and boom and bring it down.

1084
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:21,810
You let go of my risks
because you're being attacked.

1085
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:27,000
And so they looked at it and said,
and the Tom Coletta being the doctor said,

1086
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:30,420
he goes, look it. Yeah, I understand
what he's saying. And he said,

1087
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,100
I have a problem with one.

1088
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,960
And it came from Gannon McGee
versus a guy named Brad Gabe.

1089
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,710
A Bad Brad Gabriel from the IFC,
the very first show,

1090
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:44,840
they had gan mugging, you know,
you remember six foot 11 you know,

1091
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:47,970
at the time in this show,
about 335 pounds.

1092
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:52,680
And he's fighting a guy named Brad Gabriel
who is 61 200 ten two hundred fifteen

1093
01:03:52,681 --> 01:03:55,080
pounds.
And Gavin Your Brat,

1094
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:59,690
Gabriel is trying to get a hold again just
to survive and Ganis taken his armies,

1095
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,080
boom, boom, boom.

1096
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,190
And he's bringing it straight down
on top of Brad Gabriel's head.

1097
01:04:05,191 --> 01:04:08,010
And then he gets his back
and he does the same thing,

1098
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:11,760
like the old Brazilian style of
boom shots to the back of the head.

1099
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:17,190
And he said, he goes, I, I've seen,
I can't have that. He's, I see,

1100
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:20,790
I've seen them break big blocks of ice
like that. That's a dangerous hell,

1101
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:21,630
but we can't have that.

1102
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:25,440
And I started to combat it and Lorenzo
Fertitta looks at me, he goes, John,

1103
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:29,880
let it go. It's stupid.
And I go, yes sir, boss.

1104
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:33,720
And I backed away from it. And so
that became, so that's the 12 to six,

1105
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:35,040
that's the 12 to six elbow.

1106
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:39,030
And the whole thing with
the whole positioning of it.

1107
01:04:39,031 --> 01:04:42,680
12 to six I came up with that.
They're saying, all right,

1108
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,830
let me just make this clear that,

1109
01:04:43,831 --> 01:04:47,040
so we're saying that my hand comes
straight up and straight down.

1110
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:48,390
That's what's illegal.

1111
01:04:48,391 --> 01:04:51,900
So 12 o'clock to six o'clock but if I'm
inside control and I bring my arm like

1112
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:55,790
this, we're okay with it. And they
go yes. And one to seven, okay.

1113
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:01,280
One to seven 1132 all that stuff
sort of 1130 is pushing it.

1114
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:06,570
You're pushing it. But, and the,
the problem was, see I was there,

1115
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:10,890
I understood everything and I came out
and started teaching classes and stuff

1116
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,670
and it, if you listened to me, you
knew what it was. But other than that,

1117
01:05:14,671 --> 01:05:17,010
you're getting, oh,
there's a paper written.

1118
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:19,930
So you're reading the paper and
it says no downward elbow strikes.

1119
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:25,350
And that's not what the rule was.
Right. So we had actually had, you know,

1120
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,750
season two of the ultimate fighter.
Joe Stevenson is going to end up,

1121
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:31,790
he's in the semifinals. I had done
his earlier match. He had fought, uh,

1122
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:35,590
Marcus Davis and I'd went
over the rules with him.

1123
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,990
And so when we talk about
going over rules with fighters,

1124
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:42,440
there's a lot that I say, you
know, people think that, you
know, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1125
01:05:42,441 --> 01:05:45,070
no, no. Don't Topo hair don't
do that. You don't do that.

1126
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:49,300
But I had gone over things and explained
to him, yes, he, he, cause he asked me,

1127
01:05:49,301 --> 01:05:52,180
he says, in the guard, can I do this
album? Absolutely. From the guard.

1128
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,040
You can do it from the cause.
You're doing it from six to 20.

1129
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:57,580
Exactly what you're doing it. It's
nine to three, three to nine, whatever.

1130
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:01,510
You're on your back. Right. And he goes,

1131
01:06:01,511 --> 01:06:06,190
and he's going to fight in the semifinals
and he's got herb dean is as referee.

1132
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:09,100
And herb tells them, no, you
can't do that. And he goes,

1133
01:06:09,101 --> 01:06:11,980
but John McCarthy says I can do it.
And he goes, no, you can't do that.

1134
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:16,210
And so I got one. This is the
problem with MMA as we have it.

1135
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:20,170
Herb says, no. Joe Comes
out to me and says, Hey,

1136
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,000
you told me that I could do
this. I said, absolutely you can.

1137
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:25,480
He goes to her dean just said, I
can't. I go, I'll take care of it,

1138
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,430
and I go to her and I said,
hey,

1139
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:31,000
did you tell Joe Stevenson that he can't
do this elbow strike? He goes, yeah.

1140
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:35,650
He goes, that's illegal. You can't do
that. I go, Joe. I said, herb, I go,

1141
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:39,370
what do you mean it's illegal?
I go, it's 12 to six. I go,

1142
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:43,000
his hands not coming straight
up and straight down, and
he goes, yeah. Johnny goes,

1143
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:44,110
that's if the clocks on the wall,

1144
01:06:44,111 --> 01:06:46,750
but if you're on your back and your
clocks on the ceiling, he goes,

1145
01:06:46,751 --> 01:06:51,220
that's 12 to six oh Jesus.
Oh, this is what happens. And
I, I looked at and I said,

1146
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:55,180
what in the fuck? Have you ever seen
a clock on a ceiling? And he goes,

1147
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:55,800
what happened?

1148
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:00,070
But it makes sense and you have
these official enhanced by gravity.

1149
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,860
Hello, but it's still, it's gravity.

1150
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,100
It doesn't make any sense right now.

1151
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:11,130
I can tell you changed because of doctors
and fear that no one wants to be the

1152
01:07:12,371 --> 01:07:15,160
one to change it. Look at, look at all
the controversy we had when we changed.

1153
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:17,290
Just the little bit that
we've changed so far.

1154
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,860
And that was one of the things we wanted
to change the hand touch. We had it.

1155
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:22,360
Yeah,
and I'll talk about that if you want.

1156
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:26,860
But we had it in there and the
doctors for the ABC said, Nope,

1157
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:27,850
we don't want to touch that.

1158
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:31,830
So right now I can tell you what was
their rationale, their rationales,

1159
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:35,040
they don't understand it and
they're afraid to say they are.

1160
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:39,610
They look at the sport and they look at
it from a different view than you and I

1161
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:44,020
as people that are a part of it.
You and I as fans, any of that,

1162
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:45,610
they look at it from,

1163
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:50,620
well right now we've been doing
this for we'll say 20 years,

1164
01:07:50,621 --> 01:07:53,410
15 years, wherever you're at,
how long they've been doing it.

1165
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:56,920
And we haven't had a problem
having that as being illegal.

1166
01:07:56,921 --> 01:07:59,530
So as soon as we bring it into,
okay,

1167
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:04,240
now it's legal and we have a fighter
that supposedly gets hurt by it and now

1168
01:08:04,241 --> 01:08:06,940
they come after us saying, well, before
it was illegal, you guys made it legal.

1169
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:10,330
That's why I got hurt. And that's what
they're trying to avoid. They don't,

1170
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,630
they're looking at litigation and
they're looking at saying, you know what?

1171
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:16,430
Why bring that in? There's no
point. It's so frustrating.

1172
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:19,700
Totally. That's a very frustrated
right now, I will tell you,

1173
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:24,850
the University of Auburn is doing a
study for us about elbows and the power

1174
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:29,360
behind each different type
that we were having them do,

1175
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:34,430
being that one up and down.
So I've already had,

1176
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:38,150
I used to do things with sports science
and they've already done that test for

1177
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:39,410
me,
so I know what it is.

1178
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,480
But we'll have a university having a
test and so now it's going to come out.

1179
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:45,314
That elbow strikes it.

1180
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:49,700
All these elbow strikes that are allowed
are all much more powerful than that

1181
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:54,410
elbow strike. And not only that, but
forget about power because you know,

1182
01:08:54,411 --> 01:08:59,411
you could take whatever Dominick Cruz
is most powerful technique and then use

1183
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:02,720
Francis and Ganos Jack.
So are we,

1184
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:06,110
are we just saying that you can't have
power because that doesn't make any sense

1185
01:09:06,111 --> 01:09:07,400
at all. Well, no,

1186
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:10,800
because see that's what the whole
thing is with that elbow strike. Right?

1187
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,400
It's so powerful.
But what about a fucking,

1188
01:09:13,401 --> 01:09:18,140
it's not exactly nothing compared
to like a wheel spinning back kick.

1189
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,810
I tried to get people to understand,
you know, you being a hunter,

1190
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,830
you have an idea of ballistics.
Okay.

1191
01:09:24,831 --> 01:09:27,460
And it's like people get in this
whole thing about, you know,

1192
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:30,770
girls and guys and fighting and
stuff. And I try to tell him, look it,

1193
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:36,370
you cannot expect Demetrius Johnson to
have the power of a Francis and in Ghana

1194
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:42,740
or Steve, no chick or stupid
music or Daniel Cormay or
let's go down, Lord George,

1195
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:46,250
Saint Pierre, giant
heavy. He has 125 pounds.

1196
01:09:46,251 --> 01:09:50,570
We'll say the ninth of east fighting
130 539 pounds of weight behind it.

1197
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,560
He is a 22 caliber. Right? Okay.
I'm not saying he can't hurt you,

1198
01:09:55,160 --> 01:10:00,160
but he's not going to drop you because
he just doesn't have that size and you

1199
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,990
have certain genetics.
It's not genetics.

1200
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:07,370
Certain components that are coming into
play because like the Joseph Benevidez

1201
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:09,540
fight with Joseph Joseph
was doing forward,

1202
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:13,870
him brings it coming in more power
based upon movement of bodies.

1203
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:16,210
He can drop some decision timing.

1204
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:20,870
He can drop somebody with a kick because
there's more weight and power behind it.

1205
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:24,620
He can drop somebody with a knee. But
when we look at lighter weight fighters,

1206
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:29,330
we're going to get people, human beings
are put together basically the same. Okay.

1207
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:33,110
Obviously there's this guy can
take a shot. This guy can't, okay,

1208
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:34,850
that's out there.

1209
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:39,380
But if you're a fighter and you
get used to accepting damage,

1210
01:10:39,381 --> 01:10:40,550
accepting punishment,

1211
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:46,030
you can accept a lot of
things to a certain point
where that person's speed and

1212
01:10:46,461 --> 01:10:51,170
power come together to create a
velocity that will put anybody out.

1213
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:55,580
And that just comes with
strength and weight and size.

1214
01:10:56,030 --> 01:11:00,620
Because the 22 caliber bullet is not
like the 45 caliber bullet and no matter

1215
01:11:00,621 --> 01:11:01,670
who the athlete is,

1216
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,820
the downward elbow is not going to be
the most powerful strike and there are

1217
01:11:04,821 --> 01:11:08,840
snow unless they're just some
fucking downward elbow wizard.

1218
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:14,100
And there might be filling those guys out
there. I mean it's, and the tie world,

1219
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,760
there might be some guy who does one of
those Tomahawk elbows that just has a

1220
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:22,470
vicious one. But for those guys,
for this few and far between,

1221
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:26,220
so tell me how that elbow is going to
be stronger than a guy with the rolling

1222
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:28,980
thunder kick with his heel hitting
someone in the top. It's not going to be,

1223
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:32,400
or it's in Barboza wheel
kick. Hello. There's,

1224
01:11:32,401 --> 01:11:36,630
there's power that you just
can't eat from leg kicks,

1225
01:11:36,631 --> 01:11:39,420
especially from kicks with the leg.
Rather you just,

1226
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:41,970
there's no way you're going to be able
to match that with anything you do with

1227
01:11:41,971 --> 01:11:44,310
your arms. Never, never, never, never.

1228
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,790
But yet those are legal techniques because
they did legal forever and they just

1229
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:48,780
don't want to take any chances.

1230
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:51,570
There's a comfort level with it and
we've allowed that for this long.

1231
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,220
That's normal.
You know what you're getting into.

1232
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:57,960
And now I start to change it and look
at, there will be, I hate to say this,

1233
01:11:57,961 --> 01:12:02,430
there will be one fighter out there,
whoever they are, who ends up saying,

1234
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:03,140
well I'm going to,

1235
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:06,780
I have this lawyer who said I could make
money and they're going to sue somebody

1236
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:10,760
over it, you know, and they're gonna say,
that's what that was what got me hurt. Mm.

1237
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:12,610
Yeah.
Oh,

1238
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:16,140
that's why you'll never see like knees
to the head on the r eight happened.

1239
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:19,890
Just telling you right now, not
going to ever. Never, never, never.

1240
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,350
As soon as one person gets it is
to the technique. Super valid.

1241
01:12:25,351 --> 01:12:28,080
And you cannot put yourself
into positions. And this is,

1242
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:33,680
fighters are always going to work
within the parameters of what they have,

1243
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:37,410
right? And they're going to work
to, how can I benefit from this?

1244
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,800
What can I do to make this work for
me? I don't care what it is, you know,

1245
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,880
be it the cage, the ring,
you know the technique.

1246
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:50,050
There are always going to work at making
that thing work for them to the best

1247
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:53,130
that they can.
That's their job and I don't blame them.

1248
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:54,240
That's the way it's supposed to be.

1249
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,640
I'm going to beat it out of the dead
horse because this is something I talk

1250
01:12:56,641 --> 01:12:57,270
about all the time.

1251
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:02,270
What do you think about having fights
in an open area like a basketball court

1252
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:07,340
and not having a cage? Because
I feel like the cage, there's,

1253
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:12,380
there's certain things about the cage
there is it becomes an added factor.

1254
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:14,890
Does it ring become an added factor?
Yes.

1255
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:17,880
And so what a basketball
court to a certain extent.

1256
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:22,800
To a complete extent because
batteries are not stupid, right?

1257
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,320
There's smart and be able to use it,

1258
01:13:24,321 --> 01:13:27,390
get back up and you wouldn't be able to
use it to hold a guy that you would be

1259
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:30,300
able to use it to nullify.
Same as in wrestling.

1260
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,810
Ligo there just run out
of bounds the exactly.

1261
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:38,090
And Trust me guys would start doing it
to keep themselves safe because football

1262
01:13:38,551 --> 01:13:41,450
field, you know, take, take a think
about it. Think about when you, well,

1263
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:44,580
think about when you
first were at the UFC,

1264
01:13:44,581 --> 01:13:49,581
UFC 12 back then if Mark
Coleman took somebody down,

1265
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:53,280
where did he put them? Right against
Kate. Head up against the cage.

1266
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:56,970
People didn't wall walk then did. Nope,
they didn't know it. Yeah, exactly.

1267
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,830
And they get their brains beaten in.
Exactly.

1268
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:01,840
And then the cage was a benefit
for the guy on top. Exactly. Yeah.

1269
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:06,420
But still it's about reverse to a certain
oh most. But then people were like,

1270
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:10,080
oh, but takedowns against the cage take
downs are a bitch against the cage.

1271
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:12,310
They are,
but so stop trying to do that.

1272
01:14:12,311 --> 01:14:15,910
It's also possible to get that
clinch when you're pressing up a guy,

1273
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:19,330
get the hands together behind the legs
and you could look at the difference in

1274
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:22,770
the cages because I'm going to tell you
right now, there's differences in you.

1275
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,720
Trying to say the bell to cage
is better than UFC kitchen.

1276
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:28,620
I'll shut these goddamn
microphones off right now. No,

1277
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:32,920
but there is a difference in those
cages in that the USC has what we call a

1278
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:35,620
canvas.
That is an infinity line canvas.

1279
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:40,950
The fencing material is around it
and there's an actual gap that,

1280
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:45,400
so if you spill ice in the UFC cage, no
problem. You just sweep it into that hole.

1281
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:48,280
Some guys who've got their foot stuck
in that hole before I absolutely,

1282
01:14:48,281 --> 01:14:52,200
but they purposely many times put their
foot there to, to brace against the tape.

1283
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:54,760
Two key because it's now it becomes,

1284
01:14:54,761 --> 01:14:57,590
instead of me having to pull
and have to having to lift,

1285
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:02,470
we'll say 80 pounds of pressure, that
pressure becomes 160 pounds of pressure,

1286
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:05,990
whereas it's doubled edged in
there. Then go. Yeah. You know,

1287
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,250
and so as a fuck their ankle up on
that thank guys reflect their toes up.

1288
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:13,780
They've done a lot of things,
but they utilize whatever they have.

1289
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:16,990
But don't you think just for the purity
of the sport of football field be a

1290
01:15:16,991 --> 01:15:17,824
better way to go?

1291
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:21,700
I think you make the guys fighting the
metal and then you'd have guys running

1292
01:15:21,701 --> 01:15:22,690
and people would be going,
what?

1293
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:27,340
I know that fucking guy always
uses the warning zone. Exactly.

1294
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:31,270
He's going to the answer and I hated
that guy and there's no perfect.

1295
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:36,160
There's no perfect. What about,
um, the way, uh, when Myra,

1296
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:38,890
what's came back, remember he
had that Yama pit? Oh yeah.

1297
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:43,570
Remember that I went guys have tried that
sort of strategy is having a pit type

1298
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:46,470
scenario. Frank shamrock was
the first one. In fact I was,

1299
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:49,810
I was arguing with Josh Thomson about
it. It was called shoe box. Shoe box.

1300
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:50,111
That's right.

1301
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:55,111
It was first called Boo Szeto and it
got shut down by Pry Bushido it was like

1302
01:15:55,691 --> 01:15:57,670
pride Machito as far as you know,
same name,

1303
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:01,210
but it got shut down and then when he
reopened it up it was shoot box cause it

1304
01:16:01,211 --> 01:16:04,990
never really happened. It was grappling
thing. So it was like a copyright thing.

1305
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:08,260
And so he went with shoe
box and it did have that,

1306
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:12,430
it was a school more of a
square with the raised sides.

1307
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,520
Anyone you can go to the, you know,
go to Chuck Norris is and you know,

1308
01:16:15,521 --> 01:16:18,520
World Combat League member,
the member, the surface shore.

1309
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:22,360
And it was great to watch.
And it's for the fans as far as viewing,

1310
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:26,350
it's the best they do. Doing a karate
thing now. Bas Rutten's doing commentary,

1311
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:29,600
same Serrati comp combat karate,
sorry. Same sort of deal. Yeah,

1312
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:33,850
it's doing and it's a little bit higher
around the sides on the rap. I like that.

1313
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,140
Yeah. But trust me, guys are gonna
use it. They're gonna use, you know,

1314
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:40,120
back back when Bob Myerwitz
tried to come back with Yama,

1315
01:16:40,121 --> 01:16:43,450
he asked me to be part of that and I
said no, I'm sorry I can't, you know.

1316
01:16:43,451 --> 01:16:46,690
And it wasn't, I was trying
to be an idiot. I just, and
I told him, I said, look it,

1317
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:50,050
I said, your your little, cause he was
saying this is going revolution. I said,

1318
01:16:50,051 --> 01:16:53,890
no it's not. I go to, I said that
ramp is going to make my, he goes,

1319
01:16:53,891 --> 01:16:56,400
it's [inaudible]. He thought it was
going to work against takedowns.

1320
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:59,350
I said it's going make takedowns
easier cause if I back you towards it,

1321
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:03,130
now I elevate you. That just
changes my ability to drop levels.

1322
01:17:03,131 --> 01:17:07,770
Here's the karate ramp coin logo in the
center of college. Boy. There you go.

1323
01:17:07,771 --> 01:17:10,070
Like that. I like this, but it gets

1324
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,270
great. If you get stuck up
against that side, you're,

1325
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:17,090
you can't back your foot up any further.
We'll make take down, see, but easier.

1326
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,380
But then now you get into, let's talk
about reality. Okay. You look at that.

1327
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:25,850
That looks great. It's so great.
It's in a TV studio, right?

1328
01:17:25,851 --> 01:17:29,240
Because let's put that in an arena now
because every, all of those big money,

1329
01:17:29,241 --> 01:17:31,970
ringside seats, it can't
see shit. Bingo. Right.

1330
01:17:31,971 --> 01:17:34,100
Especially if you're up against the edge.
Yeah,

1331
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:38,670
but that's a problem right now in MMA,
if you watch a fight and you're,

1332
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:42,750
yeah, I get sometimes. I see sometimes
you've got the greatest team,

1333
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,400
the greatest Seton,
how it next to you and when the,

1334
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:48,020
when the posts are in the position.

1335
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:51,050
So you went from the greatest seat in
the house, the second grade a seat.

1336
01:17:51,051 --> 01:17:55,340
Now you also went from the hardest job
in the business too. In my opinion.

1337
01:17:55,341 --> 01:17:58,660
The easiest. No, not at all. Commentaries
the easiest. No, I want to look at it.

1338
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:04,080
You have set a standard for commentators
and, and, and the real thing is, you know,

1339
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:04,963
people talk all,

1340
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,730
you're always gonna have people that
love you and people that hate you.

1341
01:18:07,731 --> 01:18:08,930
And that's just people.

1342
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:14,410
But you set a standard for the way that
you call a fight with the enthusiasm

1343
01:18:15,981 --> 01:18:19,010
that you truly have for the sport.

1344
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:23,830
That always made you phenomenal at
what you did. It's not only the,

1345
01:18:23,831 --> 01:18:25,760
the knowledge that you had about fighting,

1346
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:30,350
it was the way you went about presenting
our sport and you made it happen.

1347
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:30,741
And you know,

1348
01:18:30,741 --> 01:18:34,250
you're part of the whole thing of why
the sport has gotten as big as it is.

1349
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:37,310
And I appreciate that. It's very
nice, very nice of you. It's easy.

1350
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:41,090
It's not an easy job. It's that easy
man to show up and start yelling.

1351
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:47,210
Well, for me, what is easy about it is
that it's natural is that, uh, you know,

1352
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,630
I don't like sports.
I'm not a sports guy.

1353
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,490
People come to me and they start
talking to me about football.

1354
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:55,040
I literally don't have any idea what
they're talking about when I watch a

1355
01:18:55,041 --> 01:18:57,870
football game. I don't know what's
happening. This the flag gets,

1356
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:02,060
what's the flag for what
happened? Penalty. What's
going on? Basketball Games.

1357
01:19:02,061 --> 01:19:06,320
I know that when the ball goes in the
hole with the rope around it, that's good.

1358
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:10,520
It's all I know. Soccer have no fucking
idea what's going on. It looks great.

1359
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:11,383
They're running around.

1360
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,110
But I know fighting and I am
enthusiastic about fighting and to me,

1361
01:19:15,111 --> 01:19:16,880
I don't have any room for
any other shit in my head.

1362
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:21,440
So when I call fights,
I mean that, look man,

1363
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:24,980
I watched every fight this past weekend.
I watched the Loma Chanko fight.

1364
01:19:24,981 --> 01:19:28,070
I watched Beltre fine. I was there
all great. Ryan Bader, King Mo.

1365
01:19:28,071 --> 01:19:31,400
I watched the UFC fight. Amanda Nunez,
Raquel Pennington. I watched everything.

1366
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:35,050
I will love watching combat sports
is my favorite thing to watch.

1367
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:37,520
Know that we were talking
earlier and it's like, you know,

1368
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,460
as a fan I would love to have,

1369
01:19:40,461 --> 01:19:45,080
I ain't even boxers everybody in one
little gut. This is the group that,

1370
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:49,160
this is what we watched for fighting
cause I get to see the best against the

1371
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:52,940
best. Yeah. As a fighter, it's horrible.

1372
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,160
You've got to have competition out there.

1373
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:59,690
You've got to have more promotions
because the fighter has nothing going for

1374
01:19:59,691 --> 01:20:02,870
them. If there's not other
places they can be, you know,

1375
01:20:02,871 --> 01:20:05,780
and boxing his has changed.

1376
01:20:05,781 --> 01:20:08,160
You know I still do boxing
and boxing has changed

1377
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:13,160
as far as it used to be so hard to get
Lenora's against Loma Chanko because Leon

1378
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:18,240
Aras is this champion in Loma
Chicos a champion in this way class.

1379
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:21,630
And so we're going to talk about this
forever because we're going to build this

1380
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:25,350
up, build this up to the point where
it becomes Pacquiao, Mayweather and it,

1381
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:27,510
you lost it years ago.

1382
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,510
And with MMA people look and they go,

1383
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:33,380
I wish there could be cross
promotions and look at there.

1384
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:38,300
There are the only one that doesn't
is the UFC. Okay and, and you can't,

1385
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,370
you have to understand that.
First off, Dana did do that.

1386
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,950
He did it with pride and he got screwed.

1387
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:48,940
They tried it with member when Vandelay
came over and they made this little van,

1388
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:53,980
I didn't come over. They fighting
chuck and Dave put them in the cage.

1389
01:20:53,981 --> 01:20:58,260
They put soccer Robin in the cage.
All it did was promote pride. Exactly.

1390
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:03,540
Because Dana gave, chuck took pride,
he gave Rico Rodriguez to pride.

1391
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:06,350
He gave them fighters, right.
That went over there and fought.

1392
01:21:06,351 --> 01:21:11,010
Especially chuck when Chuck was
really a very big part of the UFC.

1393
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:13,700
She just wasn't the champion.
He was number one, you know,

1394
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:16,200
and he got screwed by it and he was like,
okay,

1395
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:19,500
that ain't gonna ever happen again. And
so you can't blame him. I look and go,

1396
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:23,310
I understand why you say screw
that. And it can, you know,

1397
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:25,890
in some ways I guess it
can diminish your product.

1398
01:21:25,891 --> 01:21:30,750
If someone comes from the outside and
you know it goes against your champion,

1399
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:33,690
it could diminish your product
if you want to say that.

1400
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:38,010
I don't think it does look at,
it's a matter of people watch fighting,

1401
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:41,830
not for promotions. They watch
fighting for fighting. It's,

1402
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,430
that's why lead versus athlete.
That's why it's weird.

1403
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:49,080
That's why this UFC thing or Bella tour
thing is weird because nobody gives a

1404
01:21:49,081 --> 01:21:52,830
fuck who Gennady Golovkin fights for.
They don't give a shit.

1405
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:55,350
They don't give a shit.
If it's on HBO or if it's on showtime,

1406
01:21:55,351 --> 01:21:59,940
it's like triple g's fight tonight. How
do I watch how I watch it? You know?

1407
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:04,570
But that's the difference between what
happened with MMA. Right. I can tell you,

1408
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:06,410
you know,
back before UFC,

1409
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:12,660
UFC 30 was the first one that the
Fertittas were the owners of the UFC.

1410
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:14,380
And I can remember going to,

1411
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:19,400
was it the market is arena at the Trump
Taj Mahal and you know they're doing

1412
01:22:20,581 --> 01:22:22,890
Tito's walkout cause
Tito was the champion.

1413
01:22:22,891 --> 01:22:26,670
He's going to fight Evan Tanner and it's,
they're doing this,

1414
01:22:26,671 --> 01:22:31,671
they had to actually do this firework
display and they had to do it before the

1415
01:22:31,951 --> 01:22:36,000
show. So the fire marshal would approve
it. So you had to pay for it twice,

1416
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:40,860
you know, and it was like $50,000
worth of fireworks. Right.

1417
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:43,380
And so it was this whole
thing and he says, Hey,

1418
01:22:43,381 --> 01:22:45,890
do you want to watch it and you know
normal. I said, yeah, absolutely.

1419
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:49,830
And we're standing there
talking and Lorenzo at that
time told me, he says, man,

1420
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:54,630
I want to be the first promoter to be
able to pay an MMA fighter $1 million for

1421
01:22:54,631 --> 01:22:58,630
a fight. And I told him, that's awesome.
He goes, he says, he goes, and he goes,

1422
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,520
we're going to build this up.

1423
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:02,390
And he's talking to me and when he was
talking about, I said, you know Lorenzo,

1424
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:06,910
the only thing I can tell
you is, hey, that everything
you're saying is fantastic,

1425
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:07,833
I love it,

1426
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:12,700
but there's only one thing you can
control and that's your promotion.

1427
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:16,890
You have the UFC, because he was
talking about Bob [inaudible],

1428
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:20,650
it's not pushing fighters.
He was pushing the UFC more and I said,

1429
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:23,710
there'll get a point where you think you
have that fight or you have them under

1430
01:23:23,711 --> 01:23:27,460
contract and now you want them to do this,
you're going to set them up for this.

1431
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:31,860
And he's like, no, I don't
want to do that. I think I'd
rather just do this. I said,

1432
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,630
you're always going to have
issues with fighters to a point.

1433
01:23:34,631 --> 01:23:36,850
It's just they're looking
at what's best for them.

1434
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:38,980
And you're looking at what's best for you.

1435
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:41,740
And there's got to be always that
compromise towards the middle.

1436
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,900
I go so you can always control the brand.

1437
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:49,680
And eventually that's what he realized
his and he pushed and he made the UFC the

1438
01:23:50,921 --> 01:23:55,870
brand cause it was pride UFC.
And he started,

1439
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:58,000
you know,
from the ultimate fighter.

1440
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:03,450
He started having this term where people
associated the UFC with mixed martial

1441
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:07,210
arts. They didn't say mixed martial
arts. They said, oh the UFC,

1442
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:12,100
it's like Kleenex or xerox.
And he did an unbelievable job with that.

1443
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:15,490
That's what his job was, is to build
his company. He did, he sold it.

1444
01:24:15,491 --> 01:24:16,540
And he's a smart man.

1445
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,210
They definitely didn't nail it.
There's no doubt about Lilly.

1446
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:23,120
Obviously I'm a giant fan of
the UFC and very low them. But,

1447
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:27,370
but I want to see Rory Macdonald
fight the best fighters in the world.

1448
01:24:27,371 --> 01:24:30,490
And I think that Roy McDonald is
one of the best, if not the best,

1449
01:24:30,491 --> 01:24:33,250
170 pound fighter on the planet.
There's no doubt. There's no doubt.

1450
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:36,520
I mean you watch his fight
with Tyron Woodley and I
understand. I did that fight.

1451
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,980
It was a long time ago and
Woodley's a different fighter now,

1452
01:24:38,981 --> 01:24:41,200
especially under the tutelage
of Duke Roufus. He's just,

1453
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:45,910
but he's a better fighter. Roy Shut
them down. I mean, took away everything.

1454
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:50,110
It took away everything he did and
he showed this very, very deep,

1455
01:24:50,111 --> 01:24:51,610
well rounded game.
Look at

1456
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,540
there's,
and this is what this is.

1457
01:24:53,541 --> 01:24:58,541
Another thing that people don't get is
the UFC has a huge stable of fighters and

1458
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:00,950
I will tell you, look, you can,

1459
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:03,560
how many fighters?
His belt or having a contract,

1460
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:08,650
probably about 200 to 220 UFC
is going to be about 600 yeah,

1461
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:13,190
it's quite a bit more. Yeah, and
it's, in terms of world class,

1462
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:17,540
there's no competition. There's many,
many more world class fighters in the UFC.

1463
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:20,390
But you got Michael Chandler,
you got,

1464
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:24,250
you got some serious fighters
over in, in Beltour. Look at you.

1465
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:28,160
You take a look at the hunter
and seventies you know who
Ed Ruth is? Sure. Okay.

1466
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:32,700
Yeah. Add Ruth's going to be a monster, a
monster, a monster. Aaron Peko. Eric. Oh,

1467
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,040
how about that left hook again?
That's under left.

1468
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:39,470
Took second one of the body kids only had
two fights, you know, three fights now.

1469
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:42,140
And I'm telling you right
now they're talking in fact,

1470
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:43,940
cause he works out with Freddie Roach.

1471
01:25:43,941 --> 01:25:48,320
I was with Freddy the other day cause
they brought back the contender number,

1472
01:25:48,321 --> 01:25:50,910
the contender that was from boxing.
They're bringing it back and so I'm,

1473
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:55,220
I'm doing stuff there. And when
is Pecos third fight? His, his.

1474
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:57,830
He just had his fourth fight.
He just had his fourth. Yup.

1475
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:02,960
Why did I think he only had three? He
did until Saturday night. Oh that he,

1476
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,560
that's right. Once finally
Morrison. That's right. Yeah.

1477
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:10,670
And it took them to the body. Yup. Yeah,
it's left. Took his nasty, you know,

1478
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:15,440
Freddie Roach will tell you
John, you know, he'll tell
you Joe, he's the real deal.

1479
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,990
Oh, he's definitely going to be
a champion in boxing. He goes,

1480
01:26:17,991 --> 01:26:18,860
and I'm not kidding you,

1481
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:24,020
the kid was Miguel Cotto sparring
partner for Miguel's entire camp. Okay.

1482
01:26:24,021 --> 01:26:28,310
He goes, I wouldn't put anybody in.
That's not going to be perfect for Miguel.

1483
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:31,190
That can actually stay with Miguel.
Maybe not hurt Miguel,

1484
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:35,330
but I wouldn't put anybody in there
that wasn't a high level. He goes,

1485
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:39,980
I used them the entire camp.
Yeah, he's a super athlete. Scary,

1486
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:44,510
scary, good. And what
2021 now. 21 yup. Yeah.

1487
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:49,580
I mean he hasn't even started scratching
his prime. Not even in the neighborhood.

1488
01:26:49,581 --> 01:26:53,090
And he's just a freak as far look at,
this is what he does and he gets it. He's,

1489
01:26:53,091 --> 01:26:55,460
he's Kinda like the Floyd and you know,
he gets up at two o'clock in the morning,

1490
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,820
starts running or working out, you know,
he jumps up out of bed and does, you know,

1491
01:26:58,821 --> 01:27:03,320
a hundred pushups. You go do go to
sleep, but it's a drive. You know,

1492
01:27:03,321 --> 01:27:05,930
you want to feed the drive as much as
you want to feed the body. And that's,

1493
01:27:05,931 --> 01:27:07,490
you know,
when you're looking at fighters,

1494
01:27:07,491 --> 01:27:12,491
it's that drive to get to somewhere and
then the ability to hold on to that.

1495
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:16,610
Once you've reached that pinnacle,
now it's the drive to,

1496
01:27:16,990 --> 01:27:19,790
to get excited and to do things here.
There it is right there.

1497
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,960
You got to get away.
Just a little bit all the way back.

1498
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,730
It's just highlights.

1499
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:31,940
Bring it back to the beginning so you
can see that it is, oh, he throws it,

1500
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:35,270
he doesn't throw wide either.
He throws it up the middle like right,

1501
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:39,060
right to the rib area right next to the
solar plexus. You gotta stop doing that.

1502
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:42,800
Whatever iron fisted
matador means matador.

1503
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:48,680
Let that go. I have kids that kill
her though. No doubt about it.

1504
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,610
I mean, look, Beltour also has Bella tour
kickboxing, which I'm a great admirer.

1505
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:57,440
I love that they're doing that high level
and that's obviously Scott's original

1506
01:27:57,441 --> 01:28:01,010
background. You know, I love the fact
that doing high level kickboxing too,

1507
01:28:01,011 --> 01:28:06,011
and you know John Wayne par and Joe over
there and Ray Daniels Petrosian Georgia

1508
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:12,200
petrosal was he something to watch?
See, that's what I like when I'm,

1509
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:16,200
when I'm refereeing him, I go,
thank God I never had to fight you.

1510
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:19,070
He's such a master.
Oh,

1511
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,460
Petrosian is doing just some really
special things in there when you watch his

1512
01:28:22,461 --> 01:28:26,630
movement and this sub, some great
breakdowns of his technique online.

1513
01:28:26,631 --> 01:28:30,590
But if you watch is just footwork and
angles and he's just never there for you.

1514
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:31,880
You know what I mean?
He's just,

1515
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:35,150
he's one of the masteries the
Loma Chenko of kickboxing. Yeah.

1516
01:28:35,151 --> 01:28:38,640
He's one of the masters. Yeah. But I mean,
I've always made the argument that I,

1517
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:41,930
I love kickboxing, but I really would
appreciate more tie better. I liked,

1518
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:45,440
I liked the elbows. I like the knees. If
you're gonna, if you're just striking,

1519
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:49,550
she'd be able to do everything, be able to
clench. And this is the, in my personal,

1520
01:28:49,551 --> 01:28:50,241
and I could be wrong,

1521
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:53,660
but this is the problem that we
have with kickboxing and Muay Thai.

1522
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:57,590
Both is people don't know
what they're watching. Right.

1523
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:59,960
And then when they don't understand it,
same as you said,

1524
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:01,860
I don't understand football.
I don't understand soccer.

1525
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:05,310
As soon as you don't understand what
you're watching, you start to get, Eh,

1526
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:06,660
I could not not do it.

1527
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,960
It's understanding this is what's
allowed and being part of it now you're

1528
01:29:12,481 --> 01:29:16,050
invested in it. But if you don't
understand what the rule sets are,

1529
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:18,960
and there's so many rules sets when
it comes to kickboxing, they've,

1530
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:22,100
they've got to come together
and come up with one another.

1531
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,300
And if it's the Muay Thai set,
fine,

1532
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:27,450
get rid of the music because the
music doesn't work here in the,

1533
01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:30,810
in North America. Now the
music and also the, you know,

1534
01:29:30,811 --> 01:29:34,590
the why crew in the beginning around,
no, no one's going to get into that.

1535
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:38,100
It's just not gonna fly in
America. Nope. I mean there's some,

1536
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:43,700
I don't think it's a bad idea to make
some changes for the American audience.

1537
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:46,120
Some you've got one and that's,

1538
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:49,230
that's where you get the pushback
and the resistance is, hey,

1539
01:29:49,231 --> 01:29:52,170
this is part of our tradition and I,
I totally understand that.

1540
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:56,490
I'm not against it, but do you
want this to work or do you not?

1541
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,450
Because that's what it's come down
to. The tradition I get, I mean,

1542
01:30:00,451 --> 01:30:03,570
I do get it and I appreciate it and
it's nice and everything like that,

1543
01:30:03,571 --> 01:30:07,170
but people aren't going to sit
around for that. There's not, nope,

1544
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:10,380
we don't have time. And
everyone's on Adderall. That's
going to want to go, go, go,

1545
01:30:10,381 --> 01:30:14,340
go, go, go, go. They don't want
to sit around for that, you know?

1546
01:30:14,341 --> 01:30:17,350
Where do you think MMA is
headed? When you, when you,

1547
01:30:17,351 --> 01:30:20,620
you look at the sport and you,
do you have a sense, I mean you,

1548
01:30:20,621 --> 01:30:22,080
you've obviously been
there from the beginning.

1549
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,020
Do you have a sense of the direction?
I have an idea,

1550
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:28,650
you know what I think is
going to happen. Yeah. It's,

1551
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:32,850
everything has got to evolve
or it dies. Right? All right.

1552
01:30:32,851 --> 01:30:35,520
And when you talk about the evolution,
there's evolution for fighters,

1553
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,040
there's evolution for promoters,

1554
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:41,850
there's evolution for fans as far as what
they get to watch and how they get to

1555
01:30:41,851 --> 01:30:42,660
watch it.

1556
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:47,580
And all of that has to evolve for the
sport to continue to rise and build.

1557
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:52,800
When the UFC sold, you know, and
this is no disrespect to anyone.

1558
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:56,700
Look at the greatest thing that
the UFC had was Lorenzo Fertitta.

1559
01:30:57,330 --> 01:30:58,290
I'm just being honest.

1560
01:30:58,350 --> 01:31:03,350
Dana was fantastic for the UFC as
far as his work effort and the,

1561
01:31:04,690 --> 01:31:07,230
the amount of work he
put into it and you know,

1562
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:12,110
nonstop just going after deals. Trying
to make things happen. Right. You know,

1563
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:15,900
he was the workhorse for it, but Lorenzo's
was the brains behind it. You know,

1564
01:31:15,901 --> 01:31:20,640
there's a wizard, oh my God.
And the loss of him is great.

1565
01:31:20,970 --> 01:31:24,740
Yeah, I agree. It's already, you've
already seen things. Well it's also the,

1566
01:31:24,741 --> 01:31:25,920
the issue is the price.

1567
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:31,340
They had to pay $4 billion for
something that's probably worth two.

1568
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:36,930
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't know,
I'm not a business person, but again,

1569
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:39,960
seems like a lot of it.
How did it get, you know,

1570
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:46,200
how did it get to that? Where they,
exactly. Yeah, he's a wizard. He is,

1571
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:49,830
he, you know, and that's, but it is one
of those things that you look and you go,

1572
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:52,440
all right, things have,
they've changed and the,

1573
01:31:52,441 --> 01:31:54,000
and the way he went about doing things,

1574
01:31:54,001 --> 01:31:57,270
cause look at the one thing that the
Renzo was not afraid of was spending money

1575
01:31:57,570 --> 01:31:59,650
right now that's how the UFC survived.

1576
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:00,221
You know,

1577
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:05,221
that here's a guy that gambled and he
was 54 million because he has $44 million

1578
01:32:05,351 --> 01:32:09,130
in the hole. And when he then put 10
million more into the ultimate fighter.

1579
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:10,660
Exactly. Yeah. That was a,

1580
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:14,950
that was a time buy and he paid for all
the production and it launched a sport.

1581
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:15,750
Absolutely.

1582
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:19,570
Because you know he deserves everything
that he got from that and he deserves

1583
01:32:19,571 --> 01:32:21,250
that giant payout.
No doubt about it.

1584
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:26,460
My concern is that the monthly nut is
so gigantic that I just wonder if like

1585
01:32:29,351 --> 01:32:33,070
some people say there's too many fights,
they say there's too many fights,

1586
01:32:33,071 --> 01:32:36,700
too many televised fights
and that this is, you know,

1587
01:32:36,701 --> 01:32:39,010
this is a part of the problems.
It's oversaturated.

1588
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:41,740
So it's very difficult to sell the
paper views cause people are like, no,

1589
01:32:41,741 --> 01:32:45,340
I'm not going to buy this when I
got to watch next week on fs one,

1590
01:32:45,341 --> 01:32:48,400
there's a big card. I'm just gonna wait
for that. And that's true. That money,

1591
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:51,580
you look you at it for a while there,

1592
01:32:51,581 --> 01:32:54,970
they were almost competing against
themselves with pay per views and it was,

1593
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:59,680
you had to pay per views in a month and
you went and said, I'll buy that one.

1594
01:32:59,681 --> 01:33:02,170
I'm not going to buy that one. Yeah. You
can't be in business against yourself.

1595
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:06,070
They got rid of that.
There's also a mistake in the kind of,

1596
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:11,470
especially initially did a lot of
sort of Hollywood style promotion.

1597
01:33:11,471 --> 01:33:15,190
Like when I thought there was a real
problem was when Ronda Rousey was making

1598
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:18,190
her comeback against Amanda Nunez and
they weren't even mentioning Amanda Nunez.

1599
01:33:18,191 --> 01:33:21,970
Mike, you guys are out of your
fucking mind. Okay. This is the,

1600
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:23,650
this is the woman that
I was saying before.

1601
01:33:23,651 --> 01:33:25,570
Rhonda got one that's down by Holly Holm.

1602
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:30,520
I was saying Amanda Nunez is more
dangerous. She's fucking dangerous man.

1603
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:33,850
Especially see or in his last weekend
against Raquel Pennington and like holy

1604
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:38,050
shit just got better and better and
better and better and her fucking

1605
01:33:38,051 --> 01:33:42,450
conditioning is off the charts. It's
always a problem for the past. Yeah.

1606
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:46,340
Not Anymore. And come out like a
gang buster and she would fade. Yup.

1607
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:50,380
She's not fading anymore. Just fifth
round. She was coming out guns blazing.

1608
01:33:50,410 --> 01:33:54,730
She's a monster man. She has a fucking
monster. So when I was backstage,

1609
01:33:54,731 --> 01:33:58,200
I don't know who it was, but I remember
this guy talking and they, they did.

1610
01:33:58,201 --> 01:34:01,540
He did not know who Amanda Nunez was.

1611
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:05,980
There's some agent and he said,
whoever she is, she's cannon fodder.

1612
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:10,270
And I remember just going,
what in the fuck are you talking about?

1613
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:11,920
How can you say that?
They were so,

1614
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:15,580
they were hyped up on that video that
they made where Ron is like rottenness

1615
01:34:15,581 --> 01:34:19,300
back and she's in this mansion and
wandering on a mansion and watching Amanda

1616
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:21,820
Nunez on TV and like you
guys are out of your mind.

1617
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:25,270
You're out of your mind because it doesn't
matter how many hype pieces you make,

1618
01:34:25,271 --> 01:34:28,690
she's still got to fight Amanda
fucking Nunez. That woman is,

1619
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:34,390
she's so good and it fucking power in
our hands is like nobody else in the

1620
01:34:34,391 --> 01:34:35,170
division.

1621
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:40,170
Oh I nobody else soldier physically
strong and fast and that creates power.

1622
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,850
It's a matter of Raquel Pennington
and you look at it as a tough girl.

1623
01:34:45,851 --> 01:34:48,250
She's tough as fuck.
You look at her fight with Holly Holm.

1624
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:51,850
I mean that was the first fight for
UFC and the UFC for Holly and it was a

1625
01:34:51,851 --> 01:34:52,840
fucking split decision.

1626
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:57,620
Raquel Pennington is world class and
she's about as tough as it gets. She is

1627
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,820
me ask you this,

1628
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:02,750
what did you think after the fourth
round when she said I'm done. And her,

1629
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:04,250
her coach was like, no, you're not done.

1630
01:35:04,251 --> 01:35:06,060
You get back in there and you
get back in there. You're gonna,

1631
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:10,260
you're gonna power through. You're going
to, what'd you think of that? Yeah.

1632
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:11,630
And I'm telling you it's wrong for this.

1633
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:18,020
We as fans, as humans, we put way,

1634
01:35:18,021 --> 01:35:22,400
way too much emphasis on the
importance of a fight. Okay?

1635
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:23,460
Now it's a,

1636
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:28,190
it's a fight and it's important to that
fighter as they step into that cage for

1637
01:35:28,191 --> 01:35:30,080
that first round.

1638
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:35,590
And it's important for them as long as
they are mentally capable of enduring

1639
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:37,790
what is occurring.
Because you know,

1640
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:43,430
fighters go through evolutions
during the fight. They're strong,

1641
01:35:43,431 --> 01:35:46,280
they're weak, you know, they're
doing well, they're not doing well.

1642
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:51,710
And once a fighter tells
you, I'm done, it's gone.

1643
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:55,550
Yeah, you're expecting her. Let's
look at what you really have.

1644
01:35:55,790 --> 01:36:00,140
She lost four rounds in a row. Okay?
She lost four rounds in the row,

1645
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:03,410
particularly brutal one. Her nose
was shadow. He's got crushed.

1646
01:36:03,411 --> 01:36:06,110
Blood was pouring out all over
the place. And you know, again,

1647
01:36:06,111 --> 01:36:09,980
for people to understand, let me break
your nose and now let me punch it again.

1648
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:13,710
Okay. You have no concept because
what I'm telling you is, you know,

1649
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:18,620
during a fight, fighters don't
feel pain the way people think.

1650
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:21,470
Cause there's adrenaline and there's
all these things and it's muted.

1651
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:24,830
You feel things and sometimes
you really start to feel him.

1652
01:36:24,831 --> 01:36:26,450
And as soon as you really
start to feel them,

1653
01:36:26,451 --> 01:36:31,451
you start to lose really bad in that
situation where she had lost four rounds

1654
01:36:31,730 --> 01:36:34,970
badly. Okay. So what's going
to happen in the fifth?

1655
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,690
You think she's going to come out
with this home run shot. Okay. Okay.

1656
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:42,950
If her mind is still there, maybe,
maybe it, maybe it could happen,

1657
01:36:42,951 --> 01:36:47,060
but as soon as she says
I'm done, I want out. Hey,

1658
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:49,123
it's a fight.

1659
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:54,520
And did she received more damage after
that statement in the fifth round?

1660
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,310
Oh yeah.
She received more damage.

1661
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:01,550
And what I'm telling you
is it's like you can,

1662
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:06,140
you can have the greatest car in the
world. All right? You can have, you know,

1663
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:09,350
be it, you know, I'm not
a real great car guy,

1664
01:37:09,351 --> 01:37:11,990
but a truck that says you're
the raptor Ford Raptor truck.

1665
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:15,380
You can only crash it into the wall
so many times before it says fuck you,

1666
01:37:15,381 --> 01:37:19,550
I'm done. Okay. And is not
now no longer a nice truck.

1667
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:21,860
It's a piece of shit. It
doesn't work. Exactly.

1668
01:37:21,861 --> 01:37:26,861
And the real question is how much
damage did you do for the rest of Raquel

1669
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:28,573
Pennington's career?

1670
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:32,690
Because she took extra damage and
you never know when it is Joe.

1671
01:37:32,691 --> 01:37:33,800
And I can tell you I can,

1672
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:37,310
I can pick out fights where I can tell
you this is the difference in that

1673
01:37:37,311 --> 01:37:41,090
fighter from this fine.
In that moment he is no longer the same.

1674
01:37:41,091 --> 01:37:44,570
She is no longer the same. And
so as the trainer, what do you,

1675
01:37:44,571 --> 01:37:48,590
therefore you are there to get
your fight or ready for the fight.

1676
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:53,120
You're there to be the person that's
helping them during the fight and giving

1677
01:37:53,121 --> 01:37:56,190
them instructions and telling them
how to attack person and saying,

1678
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:58,830
you're doing this wrong. I need you
to do this. Whatever it's going to be.

1679
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:00,330
That's your job.

1680
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:05,690
You are there to sometimes motivate them
when they start to lose the belief that

1681
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:09,870
I don't know if I can beat this person
and that happens to everybody. I don't,

1682
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,890
I don't know if I can actually, this
person's kicking my ass to be that purse.

1683
01:38:13,891 --> 01:38:16,500
Hey, you're doing fine. What I
need you to do is this, you know,

1684
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:21,150
get yourself together. Be that motivator.
But once the fighter tells you,

1685
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:26,520
I'm done, hey, that's the,
mine's gone. It's over.

1686
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:30,360
Don't put them back out there
because they're not going to perform.

1687
01:38:30,361 --> 01:38:33,870
They're not going to do well. They can sit
there afterwards and say, Oh, you know,

1688
01:38:33,871 --> 01:38:37,770
I'm glad that I went out there. It
didn't change any what, what changed?

1689
01:38:37,771 --> 01:38:41,190
The only thing that changed was the
amount of damage that she incurred.

1690
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:45,390
That's it. She defended her
coach after the fight, you know?

1691
01:38:45,391 --> 01:38:49,680
But most people would know
and she believes in her
coach and she said it was the

1692
01:38:49,681 --> 01:38:50,514
right decision.

1693
01:38:50,850 --> 01:38:54,960
But most people that watch that said they
should have stopped the fight. Right.

1694
01:38:54,961 --> 01:38:55,800
When she said that,
and I,

1695
01:38:55,810 --> 01:38:59,460
and I agree with you and I
think especially when you're
dealing with someone as

1696
01:38:59,461 --> 01:39:04,050
tough as her for Raquel Pennington,
I'm a giant fan of hers.

1697
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:07,770
For her to say, I'm done. Like
you, you got to respect that.

1698
01:39:07,771 --> 01:39:10,460
When have you ever seen her quit?
Never. Okay. Never. She's just,

1699
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:15,060
she's battered and beaten down and, and
that can happen to anybody. Anybody,

1700
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:19,950
anybody look at it. You know, I mean,
it's so hard to get people to understand.

1701
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:24,750
You have no idea how hard these people
are being hit. You know, people,

1702
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:28,620
people get this idea of, oh,
I could fight with an MMA.

1703
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:31,860
You have no fucking
clue how good they are.

1704
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:37,080
They are dangerous people. And
they hit with power. You know,

1705
01:39:37,081 --> 01:39:39,930
when you're actually Nunez, when
you're weak. Well, when you're,

1706
01:39:39,931 --> 01:39:44,931
when your cage side or ring side in a
fight and you actually not only see that

1707
01:39:45,061 --> 01:39:48,100
shot,
you hear it and you hear the,

1708
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:50,340
the actual impact it's telling you.

1709
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,540
Do you realize how hard that
just hit that person, you know,

1710
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:56,700
and they're walking through a lot of those
men and you go, God damned are tough.

1711
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:00,400
Yeah. That's what I tell people
about in Ghana. Like I'm like you,

1712
01:40:00,410 --> 01:40:05,410
you think you know what it seems like
when someone hit someone really hard and

1713
01:40:06,211 --> 01:40:09,060
they see Francis hit people and he'd go,
oh Jesus,

1714
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:11,350
he's a game changer as far as his power.
Yeah.

1715
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:15,360
It's some new thing going on with
that guy. Some new new thing,

1716
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:18,160
some new thing. I mean a
guy who's got to cut, wait,

1717
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:23,180
a natural guy got to cut weight to get
the [inaudible] 65 and when he hits you,

1718
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:26,940
you literally can't take it. The
only guys being able to do it, right.

1719
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:30,150
But he's done away from everything.
But it's deeply has done it.

1720
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:34,230
And this going into that fight, man, and
this is one of the ones that the UFC,

1721
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:39,270
they were hyping the hell out of
steam out of a Francis. And I go, man,

1722
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:42,090
you are not hyping your champion.
And I'm telling you right now,

1723
01:40:42,091 --> 01:40:45,150
if this flight gets out of the first
round, Steve Bay is gonna win it.

1724
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:48,300
I didn't have,
and I'm not the smartest guy in the world,

1725
01:40:48,301 --> 01:40:53,301
but it's looking at Steve Bay is the more
complete fighter and look at the guys

1726
01:40:54,101 --> 01:40:58,630
that he's fought. Mara can destroyed him.
Yup. Okay. Do you think Mark Hunt can hit?

1727
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:00,610
Yup.
You know it's like don't,

1728
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:05,640
it's not like he hasn't fought guys that
can fricking Bang Junior dos Santos and

1729
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:09,580
destroying y'all have fought him twice.
Overeem drive by Overeem came back,

1730
01:41:09,581 --> 01:41:13,560
came back to him out. So he's
demonstrated what he can do. But you're,

1731
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:18,600
you got Francis and he's got that almost
Mike Tyson type of mystique about that

1732
01:41:19,511 --> 01:41:20,820
power and I understand that.
Look it,

1733
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:24,880
you just don't see guys hitting upper
cuts at snap. Someone's head back.

1734
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:27,610
My mind can do for that fight.

1735
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:31,850
That was more impressive than anything
Tyson never did because he'd knocked over

1736
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:35,650
him into orbit. Oh my God. Overeem
was completely unconscious.

1737
01:41:35,651 --> 01:41:40,651
Toes curled with one shot in a way that
like you just don't see Michael Spinks.

1738
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,700
Yeah,
that was speaks,

1739
01:41:42,701 --> 01:41:46,480
it already been dropped and he drops
banks and had him hurt and then spanx get

1740
01:41:46,481 --> 01:41:49,750
up and he hit him with that right
hand. That was, that was real similar.

1741
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:53,170
But there's something about Frances is
power and if obviously you're dealing

1742
01:41:53,171 --> 01:41:56,290
with four ounce gloves, but you're dealing
with a way bigger man too. Absolutely.

1743
01:41:56,291 --> 01:41:59,530
Is 40 plus pounds bigger
than Mike near lows? Oh yeah.

1744
01:41:59,590 --> 01:42:02,470
Two well to 75 the night of the fight.

1745
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:06,010
Easy compared to no
bigger than not even that.

1746
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:09,910
Probably right to 18 at the both.
Somewhere in there. So yeah, I mean, look,

1747
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:12,440
obviously completely
different sports bikes,

1748
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:15,340
one of the greatest heavyweight
boxers of all time, without a doubt.

1749
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:19,540
But there's something about in Ganos
power that's, it's other worldly. Oh yeah.

1750
01:42:19,541 --> 01:42:22,990
It's freakish. Like you see people get
hit and he see this look on their face.

1751
01:42:22,991 --> 01:42:27,640
They're like, oh Geez. But you've had
that same look. And no matter if it's,

1752
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:30,960
you're doing kickboxing sparring
or grappling with summer,

1753
01:42:30,961 --> 01:42:33,820
and all of a sudden someone's
doing something and you're
like, Holy Shit. Yup, Yup.

1754
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:37,120
There's some holy shit people out there,
man. There's some next level people,

1755
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:38,050
scary people.

1756
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:42,240
Well it makes you think like what would
happen if you got a guy like a Lebron

1757
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:42,260
James,

1758
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:47,200
like a real super athlete and they got
invested in MMA the way Aaron Peko is,

1759
01:42:47,710 --> 01:42:51,550
you know, I'll tell you what I did. I
did, uh, he might be too big. There was,

1760
01:42:51,551 --> 01:42:56,250
there was a guy named God,
I want to say Golston. Uh,

1761
01:42:56,290 --> 01:43:00,220
he was a safety for the
frickin 40 niners and um,

1762
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:04,960
can't remember his first name. I'm an
idiot. But I was doing trading with, uh,

1763
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:08,650
a bunch of NFL players and
MMA guys and just, you know,

1764
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:13,710
getting NFL guys to do martial arts
type training to help with their

1765
01:43:13,721 --> 01:43:16,360
flexibility, to help with their
strength, helped with their conditioning.

1766
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:20,710
And I had, frank Trigg was one of the
guys there and then I, and Gholston was,

1767
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:24,250
I had them doing armbars just swinging
hips left to right, left to right.

1768
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:29,110
And you know, crunk, you know, to keep it
for core and he's doing it. I said, no,

1769
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,810
look, this is what I want you
to do. Every time you grab this,

1770
01:43:31,811 --> 01:43:33,610
I want you to take this and I want
your legs to do this and I want you to

1771
01:43:33,611 --> 01:43:38,590
squeeze, right? Just, you know, basic
stuff. And he starts doing it. Frank Goes,

1772
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:43,570
God, God dammit. Thanks John.
Right? I think he's getting cracked.

1773
01:43:43,571 --> 01:43:45,190
I mean,
it's pressure.

1774
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:48,910
And then we'd go and we're doing kicking
exercises and I got him up and his back.

1775
01:43:48,911 --> 01:43:49,744
I said,
not what?

1776
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:53,510
I want you to take your foot and I need
you to rotate on the ball of your foot.

1777
01:43:53,511 --> 01:43:54,350
I need you to do this.

1778
01:43:54,710 --> 01:43:56,750
Your foot's going to come right
here and I want it to end up here.

1779
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:00,680
And he starts cracking this bag.
And Joe, I'm like, oh my God.

1780
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:05,000
Could you imagine that this guy wanted
to fight until he got real training? Oh,

1781
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:10,640
gun, talking about Vernon
Vernon goals. He's that guy.

1782
01:44:12,130 --> 01:44:16,670
He was, he was a safety for the 40. Niners
and then, uh, then went to Tampa Bay.

1783
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:18,920
Let's just gaze at this man's
physique for a few months.

1784
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:23,790
What in the fuck all men or not,
but that's exactly what gentlemen,

1785
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,700
they must be brothers because they
know there's, there's some next level.

1786
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:31,200
W Jamie,
how much do you think Lebron ways?

1787
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:36,280
Probably to 50 oh, six
foot eight. He's not even,

1788
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:41,660
not even too big to fight him.
That's a good question.

1789
01:44:41,661 --> 01:44:45,920
What do you think about that weight class?
Like the two 65 weight limit.

1790
01:44:45,921 --> 01:44:48,660
It shouldn't heavyweight.
Just be fucking giant. Yeah.

1791
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:52,670
Just should be as big as he can
get. Yup. Yeah. Why is that?

1792
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:57,700
Because he looked and there really should
be something between two oh five and,

1793
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:02,060
well there is, okay, let's, let's,
let's bring this out right now.

1794
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:04,580
There are weight classes that
aren't being used, right? Okay.

1795
01:45:04,581 --> 01:45:09,230
They're out there as far as they
are a part of athletic commissions.

1796
01:45:09,231 --> 01:45:13,820
They're approved by the ABC.
You've got one 65.

1797
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:18,980
Okay. This is California started this, I
believe Andy Foster, he started as far as,

1798
01:45:18,981 --> 01:45:23,330
um, I'm a big fan of that guy. Look at
him. He's outstanding and what he does,

1799
01:45:23,331 --> 01:45:26,750
he's proactive. He's trying to
make things right for fighters.

1800
01:45:26,751 --> 01:45:31,710
He's absolutely fine. Be Boxed. He
fought MMA. He had a good record. Yup.

1801
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:35,660
You know, he's done it all and he's, he's
officiated, he's done the entire thing.

1802
01:45:35,661 --> 01:45:40,661
So He's fantastic for the sport
of boxing and the sport of MMA.

1803
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:46,040
But when you're looking at
everything that, you know,
as far as weights, you know,

1804
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:47,660
we went and said,
look it,

1805
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:52,750
there's 10 pounds between (253) 054-0550
five why are we jumping 15 pounds?

1806
01:45:53,810 --> 01:45:55,190
Okay,
let's,

1807
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:58,100
because we have all these guys making
these cuts and there are those guys that

1808
01:45:58,101 --> 01:46:02,060
are the tweeners, you know, if
you want to say, you know, Kelvin,

1809
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:07,750
is he a tweener at one 70 to one
75 he could make the one 75 wait,

1810
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:13,390
he can't make the one 70 well he can, he
can't because of the way he does things.

1811
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:18,350
Yeah, he has any can you just can't do
it the way he likes to eat. Exactly.

1812
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:23,120
But he could do with the things he
likes. Yes. Seven 75 yeah, no, I agree.

1813
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:25,730
But in the, this is where, you know,

1814
01:46:25,731 --> 01:46:30,650
and this is the UFC is the most powerful
entity with an MMA. And you know,

1815
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:33,620
look at, they've done a ton
of great things for the sport,

1816
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:37,360
but they've also done things that have
held the sport back. Like what? Weight,

1817
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:41,660
weights, weight classes. Because as
soon as we start to come up with, hey,

1818
01:46:41,661 --> 01:46:43,240
we're going to do this,
this is going to be a real change.

1819
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:47,300
They're the first ones to go with. What
we've forgotten that UFC used to have,

1820
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:52,330
the weight class was one 90 it wasn't
two oh five when we've changed a lot of

1821
01:46:52,411 --> 01:46:54,330
shit.
We first did the unified rules.

1822
01:46:54,331 --> 01:46:59,331
Tito Ortiz was the light heavyweight
champion at one 99.9 and as soon as the

1823
01:47:00,631 --> 01:47:02,010
unified rules came in and we said,
okay,

1824
01:47:02,011 --> 01:47:05,820
that is two five two zero t his was the
light heavyweight champion at two oh

1825
01:47:05,821 --> 01:47:08,100
five right. Why don't they
do that? Why don't they?

1826
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,320
Because you have some new champions,

1827
01:47:10,350 --> 01:47:15,210
have some new championship fights because
you have people that are in a position,

1828
01:47:15,650 --> 01:47:19,470
you know, it's like Dana,
it's Dana doesn't know. Okay.

1829
01:47:19,471 --> 01:47:24,330
Dana's told things by people because he
can't know everything and when he hears

1830
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:27,960
that, oh, they're talking about
new weight classes, the fur,

1831
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:31,950
he doesn't make a comment about it. He
goes to his people and he says, Hey,

1832
01:47:31,951 --> 01:47:36,540
is this a problem for us?
And you have Sean Shelby and Mitt mic.

1833
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:41,040
Maynard are the two matchmakers
for the UFC and they look in the,

1834
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:46,710
they have enough problems as it is
with they're getting everybody to the,

1835
01:47:46,711 --> 01:47:46,951
you know,

1836
01:47:46,951 --> 01:47:49,890
the fight and making sure that fight
happens and stuff and guys are pulling out

1837
01:47:49,891 --> 01:47:53,160
and stuff and they're going to tell
you, oh, we don't want that. Right,

1838
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:57,980
because you're diluting my weight class
now when you're not diluting your weight

1839
01:47:57,981 --> 01:48:00,810
class, just move that person here
and move this person. You're,

1840
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:01,833
you're putting them in.

1841
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:04,680
But they're is going to say that you're
diluting it and you're making it too

1842
01:48:04,681 --> 01:48:07,950
narrow for them. And so they don't
want that change in the way class.

1843
01:48:07,951 --> 01:48:10,920
So Dana goes, we don't want
changes in the way class. Okay.

1844
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:17,930
The sport of MMA needs changes in the
weight class because there's so many

1845
01:48:18,571 --> 01:48:22,770
fighters out there that look
at when we make changes,

1846
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:25,560
the change is not for the UFC.

1847
01:48:25,770 --> 01:48:30,770
The UFC does not have to have that
weight class if they don't want it.

1848
01:48:31,530 --> 01:48:32,700
They can sit there and say,

1849
01:48:32,701 --> 01:48:37,701
and the reason that the 170 pound weight
class stayed and remained is because of

1850
01:48:38,281 --> 01:48:43,110
the UFC. They said, ah okay, we'll agree
to bringing in more weight classes,

1851
01:48:43,111 --> 01:48:47,100
but we want to keep the one 70 cause they
didn't want to move Tyrone Woodley and

1852
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:51,900
they didn't want to have to move their
champions when it's not a big deal,

1853
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:55,980
but when we do a change to the sport,
it's to the sport.

1854
01:48:55,981 --> 01:49:00,900
It's not to the UFC, it's not
to Bella tour. It's not two one,

1855
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:05,100
so it's valid to are adding
weight classes. Delta has
an added those either. Okay.

1856
01:49:05,101 --> 01:49:09,240
I haven't added them. That's
the promotions. Right.

1857
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:11,340
The promotion can sit there and say,

1858
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:14,570
you know right now Bella tour doesn't
have 125 pound champion there.

1859
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:17,040
They're doing the heavyweight. They
don't even have a heavyweight champion.

1860
01:49:17,041 --> 01:49:20,190
Which there will be after the
Grand Prix tournament. So they,

1861
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:25,250
so there's a 55 now there's a 65 to
develop that they move the 70 to 75 70 is

1862
01:49:26,881 --> 01:49:31,370
still there at this moment. So right
now he does have a log jam as well.

1863
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:36,330
70 is legal, 75 is legal.
65 is legal. 55 asleep.

1864
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:40,680
I feel like 10 pounds is perfect.
I think that's perfect. It is.

1865
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:45,740
The jumps between like 85 and two oh
five and then it's 2005 and two and

1866
01:49:46,430 --> 01:49:48,980
heavyweight to 65 that's
crazy to see by the end.

1867
01:49:48,981 --> 01:49:50,700
This is where you get into this.
You know,

1868
01:49:50,890 --> 01:49:54,220
everyone gets back into the well hoists.
Gracie fought guys that were bigger.

1869
01:49:54,221 --> 01:49:58,120
It's like they didn't know any better
back then. They were clueless. Yeah.

1870
01:49:58,121 --> 01:50:03,121
It's a different world when you talk
about size now and when the skill level is

1871
01:50:03,491 --> 01:50:07,300
the same and the size is different. I can
tell you who's going to win that fight.

1872
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:10,360
The Bay guys, 100% okay.
Just about every time.

1873
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:13,480
So when you look and you said
if I went and said, okay,

1874
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:17,470
let's take a look at Brock Lesnar
versus Randy couture. Okay.

1875
01:50:17,471 --> 01:50:20,920
Brock Lesner is coming in
weighing two 65 for the,

1876
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:25,150
for the Scales and he's two
85 at least for that night.

1877
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:28,000
Radic tourists coming in and
he's two 24 for the scales.

1878
01:50:28,150 --> 01:50:31,810
That's what he's going to be
that night. Okay. So we have, eh,

1879
01:50:32,110 --> 01:50:36,760
only a 60 pound difference. Okay. So if
I sat sat here right now and said, okay,

1880
01:50:36,761 --> 01:50:41,380
I'm going to take Demetrius Johnson
and put him against Chris Weidman,

1881
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:45,820
you're well Romero. Right? Okay. You'd
look at me and go, are you fucking nuts?

1882
01:50:46,630 --> 01:50:49,510
Okay. Yeah, because, well that's stupid.

1883
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:53,320
But that's reality of what we do at
times and the heavyweight division.

1884
01:50:53,321 --> 01:50:56,830
So we do need something
that is two or five sort of,

1885
01:50:56,860 --> 01:51:00,310
you do have smaller heavyweights. We deal
with the percentage of the body size,

1886
01:51:00,330 --> 01:51:05,320
that it's far greater percentage of the
body size going from one 25 to one 85

1887
01:51:05,530 --> 01:51:10,530
versus biggest percentage is going to
be in that one 55 to one 85 that you've

1888
01:51:11,111 --> 01:51:12,040
got more fighters.

1889
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:15,730
One 45 two one 85 what I'm saying to
someone fighting someone was 60 pounds

1890
01:51:15,731 --> 01:51:19,560
larger than them when they're 125 pounds
is a way different thing percentage

1891
01:51:19,561 --> 01:51:23,710
wise. Yes. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. But
it's, it's that same concept, right?

1892
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:26,740
I could sit there and move it up to 45
still ridiculous that you have a two oh

1893
01:51:26,741 --> 01:51:31,150
five to two 65 you have a 60 pound
weight class. That's a crazy, crazy,

1894
01:51:31,151 --> 01:51:33,910
but it should be off of, you
know, you got guys that are,

1895
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:38,860
are smaller heavyweights that cut so much
way to get to light heavyweight. Right.

1896
01:51:39,190 --> 01:51:42,460
Okay. And that it's not
held at two 25 absolutely.

1897
01:51:42,461 --> 01:51:47,461
So you create a to 25 and then
everything else is 55 657585905205 to 25.

1898
01:51:50,951 --> 01:51:54,220
You get a little bit of a gap there and
then heavyweight and heavyweight should

1899
01:51:54,221 --> 01:51:59,110
be fucking whatever you are. You are,
you know the big, the big, heavy,

1900
01:51:59,111 --> 01:52:01,480
heavy, heavy guys. They're
not going to do well anyway.

1901
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:07,080
Remember that guy boxing huge
boxing seven, seven one tall,

1902
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:12,340
gigantic. Who beat him? Did
David? Hey beat him. Did he?

1903
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:16,090
I was um, was it David had to leave
David. Hey beat him and somebody,

1904
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:19,680
which is crazy cause David is, I think
at the end our holy father fought him.

1905
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:24,640
Did he? I think he's wonderful. He
did? Yeah. Wow. Yeah. That's crazy.

1906
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:29,470
Yeah. That guy was almost,
well not almost, he was too
big cause body didn't work.

1907
01:52:29,471 --> 01:52:34,140
Right. Look at there is a a point
of diminishing returns. Yeah,

1908
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:39,070
no return. You're going to go down
from that point and to be a big guy,

1909
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:42,410
you can accept more punishment,
but you can only accept it for so long.

1910
01:52:42,411 --> 01:52:44,110
I lost the David. Hey,
that was his last fight.

1911
01:52:44,111 --> 01:52:45,850
Evander Holyfield David
here where you go see,

1912
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:48,830
oh, he'd beat Evander Holyfield
but he'd beat Holyfield in 2008.

1913
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:53,670
That was a different beat. John
Ruiz, Clifford Clifford it.

1914
01:52:53,671 --> 01:52:56,280
Nene let Larry Donald John Ruiz.
Interesting.

1915
01:52:56,370 --> 01:53:00,980
He went through some people there
because he's so big. He's a tough, uh,

1916
01:53:01,370 --> 01:53:05,150
yeah. I mean just so body to push
against. Yeah. It's just so big.

1917
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:10,010
But I mean it would be interesting to
see what would happen if you let Francis

1918
01:53:10,011 --> 01:53:10,970
and gone. Oh, powerlift

1919
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:17,170
yeah. And again, you look
at this and you go, hey,

1920
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:21,820
I would rather see Francis
[inaudible] not cutting weight at all.

1921
01:53:22,710 --> 01:53:27,670
You know, and being healthy, being
healthy and stepping in that cage.

1922
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:31,540
This is the thing that people don't
get is when we talk about weight cuts,

1923
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:36,400
you talk about boxing and MMA there,
there are two different sports. One,

1924
01:53:36,430 --> 01:53:40,690
I will tell you, MMA is more
violent than boxing. Okay.

1925
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:44,970
Vi more violent because you could pick
somebody up six feet off the ground,

1926
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:49,480
drop them down onto the
surface. Okay. You can pull,

1927
01:53:49,540 --> 01:53:53,980
pull someone's arm back to the
point, the elbow hyperextends. Okay.

1928
01:53:53,981 --> 01:53:57,730
And to the point where it actually
dislocates that's a more violent but more

1929
01:53:57,820 --> 01:54:00,010
damaging is boxing

1930
01:54:00,210 --> 01:54:04,750
you team mean overall career
careerwise eet more day. Exactly. Yeah,

1931
01:54:04,751 --> 01:54:06,910
because you get hit in the head more.
You've got to target,

1932
01:54:07,170 --> 01:54:11,340
I got two tools to targets and 90%
of those blows go to the head. Okay.

1933
01:54:11,341 --> 01:54:16,341
But when you're looking at boxers or MMA
fighters and when we have problems with

1934
01:54:17,341 --> 01:54:20,550
the weight cuts and we have
problems with subdural Hematomas,

1935
01:54:20,551 --> 01:54:25,551
it's always the smaller fighters and it's
because they lose so much weight that

1936
01:54:26,251 --> 01:54:30,690
it becomes a problematic thing
with that fight where their,

1937
01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:34,620
their brains are dehydrated,
it pulls away from the Dura.

1938
01:54:34,621 --> 01:54:38,550
You have all these things that can happen
with bleeding and it cannot stop it

1939
01:54:38,970 --> 01:54:42,570
and we get problems from it.
So let's try to get guys in the closer,

1940
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:47,200
credibly unusual for a heavyweight
to die in the ring. And in fact,

1941
01:54:47,201 --> 01:54:52,150
I think that guy who fought Luis
Ortiz, remember that Russian cab? Yeah.

1942
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:54,280
That was about what, three
years ago maybe? Yeah.

1943
01:54:54,281 --> 01:54:58,150
That was in New York and that guy got
really, really badly hurt and that fight,

1944
01:54:58,151 --> 01:55:02,270
and that was one of the rare situations
where a heavyweight experience like

1945
01:55:02,410 --> 01:55:05,410
serious brain bleeding got
rushed to the hospital.

1946
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:08,400
He had his cheek crushed
in the second round. Okay.

1947
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:13,720
Imagine fighting and having a heavyweight
boxer punching your face when your

1948
01:55:13,721 --> 01:55:17,860
cheek is broken and crushed. Yeah.
All right. Just everything in that,

1949
01:55:17,861 --> 01:55:22,861
and this is where sometimes corners need
to stop for you are there to protect

1950
01:55:23,141 --> 01:55:25,330
your fight or sometimes from themselves.

1951
01:55:25,810 --> 01:55:29,830
They are so tough that doing
the stink of a no moss,

1952
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:32,770
you know that and that,
especially in boxing, look at,

1953
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:37,840
think about when did that fight occur and
it's still talked about 40 years later.

1954
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:41,200
One of the things that Conor McGregor and
Floyd Mayweather was saying during the

1955
01:55:41,201 --> 01:55:44,730
fight, Floyd may was said, there's no
tap outs in, does no tap outs in boxing.

1956
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,750
Listen Dude, if you got an MMA,
you'd fucking tap out, tap out.

1957
01:55:48,751 --> 01:55:50,290
He'd go to sleep or get your arm broken.

1958
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:54,300
And you don't want either one
of those things to happen.
Nope. Yeah, talk is great,

1959
01:55:54,301 --> 01:55:58,950
but it's great. I will give them credit
as far as the way they hyped that fight,

1960
01:56:00,110 --> 01:56:03,410
it got out of hand at some point. It's
exciting, but you got to look down

1961
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:07,890
at the weigh ins.
Connor with a boner in his underwear.

1962
01:56:07,891 --> 01:56:10,380
I don't know what he did
to give himself a boner,

1963
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:14,470
but he's like kind of at least at
least at three quarters. But got a job.

1964
01:56:14,610 --> 01:56:18,030
He's got a Chubby and he's screaming
at him in his face like, Whoa,

1965
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:21,000
what is happening here? He was being
attacked from both and angle. Yeah.

1966
01:56:23,630 --> 01:56:27,600
Yeah, but it didn't help in the
long run. You knew. Come on.

1967
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:30,530
Anybody think about on that crazy.
Talk about it turned Jane.

1968
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:31,890
Dan has said it's 100% bullshit,

1969
01:56:31,891 --> 01:56:36,891
but the crazy talk about Conor and
Floyd fighting in MMA cage with boxing

1970
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:41,490
gloves. No kicks, no
takedowns, no submissions.

1971
01:56:41,660 --> 01:56:46,380
But you can clinch. It's
ridiculous because the clinch
is going to do you what?

1972
01:56:46,381 --> 01:56:50,670
Good in that you can
dirty box and you know,

1973
01:56:50,850 --> 01:56:51,683
I'm going to tell you,

1974
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,100
Connor has the ability to dirty box better
than Floyd because Floyd is not used

1975
01:56:56,101 --> 01:56:59,310
to doing it. It's a different
element. But look it,

1976
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,830
if you're going to come
into another man's sport,

1977
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:04,620
quit trying to change the rules.
Yeah. Just come into this.

1978
01:57:04,621 --> 01:57:07,410
Carter went into his sport.
He didn't change the rules.

1979
01:57:07,411 --> 01:57:10,300
Now he did some things illegally.
I'll give him that. You know,

1980
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:13,500
he's hitting it with a hammer fist. He's
doing things. You Go, you can't do that.

1981
01:57:13,730 --> 01:57:18,270
Right. But for the most part,
he's following those rules part.

1982
01:57:18,390 --> 01:57:19,031
Okay.
Oh,

1983
01:57:19,031 --> 01:57:23,720
you'd have to do is just say no take
downs and no submissions and no glasses

1984
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:26,880
before that first one. Go ahead.
Before the first one I said, no,

1985
01:57:26,881 --> 01:57:29,130
I don't want to see Conor box.
And I said, tell you what,

1986
01:57:29,131 --> 01:57:33,480
let's make it halfway even. Yup.
Kickboxing. Yeah. Okay. No take downs.

1987
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:38,100
No Brown. But he gets to get kicked.
It would have changed that fight.

1988
01:57:38,190 --> 01:57:42,390
Oh fuck yeah. Yeah. But
you know, Floyd smart,

1989
01:57:42,391 --> 01:57:45,030
I don't blame him for doing what you know.
And he's a moneymaking machine.

1990
01:57:45,031 --> 01:57:48,420
He's smart and he's not going to
do anything stupid. If anything,

1991
01:57:48,421 --> 01:57:51,930
he'll wait for some other box to get
really pop or other MMA fighter to get

1992
01:57:51,931 --> 01:57:56,220
really popular and box
him. Smart man. I mean,

1993
01:57:56,221 --> 01:58:00,750
he literally might not ever
box a boxer again. I mean,

1994
01:58:00,751 --> 01:58:05,700
he made his biggest pay day ever fighting
a guy was zero zero zero professional

1995
01:58:05,701 --> 01:58:09,810
boxer boxing fights. Pretty
crazy. It's absolutely crazy.

1996
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,880
What was his payout,
would they say? Overall,

1997
01:58:11,881 --> 01:58:15,210
it was like something more the
hundred million, $300 million.

1998
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:17,280
That's a good piece of change.
That'll,

1999
01:58:17,310 --> 01:58:22,080
that'll tide him over for about two
years and I'm not even kidding. Hey,

2000
01:58:22,230 --> 01:58:25,600
that guy spends money like water.
It's crazy. He does. He's crazy.

2001
01:58:25,601 --> 01:58:28,950
He's fun to watch though. It's fun
to watch you spend all that money to,

2002
01:58:29,370 --> 01:58:34,260
it's like Jesus Christ. You know? I
watch him split it. I cringe. Yeah,

2003
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:35,850
I can't. It's like, oh, I can't,

2004
01:58:35,890 --> 01:58:38,220
I can't even believe that you're
paying that money for that. Why?

2005
01:58:38,221 --> 01:58:42,100
It's like every gets like that broke.
They all go

2006
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:46,360
broke. It's just a matter of time. That's
what I don't want to see. Yeah, but don't,

2007
01:58:46,361 --> 01:58:48,630
Ya know, isn't it kind of fun? I mean,

2008
01:58:49,030 --> 01:58:52,720
is it terrible that he has to get a job
like regular folks? He's a terrible,

2009
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:55,360
I mean, what, what is tig? There's
something about that, right?

2010
01:58:55,361 --> 01:58:59,290
If we give you go to a fucking
job site and you see a guy,

2011
01:58:59,291 --> 01:59:01,270
I was working as a finished carpenter,
you don't go,

2012
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:05,050
poor guy's got to work as a
finished carpenter. He'd go,
hey man, what's going on?

2013
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:08,020
He goes, hey, how you doing? Everybody's
fine. Everybody's fine with that.

2014
01:59:08,230 --> 01:59:12,100
But if that guy used to be
Floyd Mayweather and now
he's working as a finished

2015
01:59:12,101 --> 01:59:16,360
carpenter. Is that poor
bastard? Oh, amber, those
nails. No. No. What's it like?

2016
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:19,840
Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I hit that.
Oh yeah. That you fucking loser.

2017
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:23,080
You used to be on top of the world. Sure.
To spit all the fucking money, Floyd.

2018
01:59:23,610 --> 01:59:26,470
Right? Isn't that weird? It's
a weird thing that people do.

2019
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:31,090
I used to work with a guy named Mike
Quarry. I remember Mike Pori Corey. Sure.

2020
01:59:31,450 --> 01:59:34,690
And you know Mike was a professional
boxer like every way, right? Absolutely.

2021
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,020
Fuck Bob Foster for the man
we title back in the day.

2022
01:59:38,050 --> 01:59:41,470
I used to dig holes with my query.
Wow.

2023
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:46,240
I used to do plumbing with him and he was,
he was a great guy, but he was a mess.

2024
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:51,010
I mean punch drunk. Oh yeah, absolutely.
And his brother was even worse,

2025
01:59:51,011 --> 01:59:54,310
but you know, it couldn't, he couldn't,
you know, couldn't wheel a wheelbarrow.

2026
01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:56,920
They didn't have the balance
and coordination to do any more.

2027
01:59:56,921 --> 02:00:00,460
But if you put him in and I would spar
with him, we'd go in and we would,

2028
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:03,790
we would work out and you put them in a
ring and all of a sudden he started to

2029
02:00:03,791 --> 02:00:05,740
bounce.
He could fight still.

2030
02:00:05,741 --> 02:00:10,150
It was just part of who that
ability to do it. Exactly.

2031
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:14,860
He carved. Yep. And it's, you know, and
it's, but it's sad because, you know, he,

2032
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:18,010
he ended up leaving that and he ended
up going, he tried to become a, uh,

2033
02:00:19,740 --> 02:00:24,040
a haircutter tried to become a blouse.
Yeah. He tried to become a barber.

2034
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:29,590
He cut his thumb off, you know, all
day. And you're looking at go, it's sad.

2035
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:32,620
You know,
it's like he had had to do those things.

2036
02:00:32,670 --> 02:00:37,180
Cause though is that he's physically
damaged and he can't move right and can't

2037
02:00:37,181 --> 02:00:40,680
talk right and all that stuff. But is it
Saturday has to work a regular job? No,

2038
02:00:40,930 --> 02:00:41,651
that's not sad.

2039
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:44,950
But it's sad when you look and you say
he could have gotten away with that if

2040
02:00:44,951 --> 02:00:46,180
you just saved all that money.
If you,

2041
02:00:46,181 --> 02:00:49,390
if someone was smart enough
to tell you back then look it,

2042
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:51,580
I want you to take this
much and put it here.

2043
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:56,020
Maybe you wouldn't have to be doing
this today. And you look at, you know,

2044
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:58,160
his whole thing,

2045
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:02,190
his way his dad was with him and you know
with the things he went through, it's,

2046
02:01:02,191 --> 02:01:04,540
you look and you go,
I feel bad.

2047
02:01:04,780 --> 02:01:07,660
I feel bad that you're having to
come in here everyday like I am.

2048
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:10,470
But after what you've
done in your life and the,

2049
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:14,560
and the status that you actually had
at one time, yeah, I feel bad. Yeah,

2050
02:01:14,710 --> 02:01:17,140
you feel bad. But if he was just a
regular guy, you wouldn't feel bad.

2051
02:01:17,170 --> 02:01:21,730
That's where it's weird. That's fucking
weird. It's a weird thing, right? It is.

2052
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:23,950
You know, it's, we, we, we elevate people,

2053
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:30,100
but it's also nobody really wants to
work. Right. Very few of you love work.

2054
02:01:30,101 --> 02:01:32,550
Not a regular job. I don't
know. You're working at bell.

2055
02:01:32,551 --> 02:01:35,970
Tore your fucking commentator. Stop. Okay.
Stop. Hold on. I want to send me my job.

2056
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:39,350
I told you that's easy. I want you to
think of it. This is my third career. Yes.

2057
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:40,240
Okay.

2058
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:42,740
I was a police officer. He loved
that too. Okay. I loved it.

2059
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:47,160
I had a ball doing it and then I had
a career as a referee. Basically.

2060
02:01:47,450 --> 02:01:49,610
I loved it. I still do. You know,

2061
02:01:49,611 --> 02:01:52,970
don't think that I wouldn't like to
go and still do fights and stuff and,

2062
02:01:52,971 --> 02:01:55,250
and I watch a fine. God Damn,
I wish I was sitting there.

2063
02:01:55,490 --> 02:01:59,660
Why can't they let you do both? It doesn't
make any sense to me. Ah, you know,

2064
02:01:59,661 --> 02:02:03,000
I was running shit.
I will absolutely let you do both,

2065
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:05,060
but this is the differences,
you know,

2066
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:11,020
MMA and boxing or set up
completely different than
any other sport as far as how

2067
02:02:12,411 --> 02:02:16,110
they're run, you know, the NFL, you know,

2068
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:18,290
this is why I tried to say this with,
you know,

2069
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:22,950
people wanting to come into
officiating for the MMA. And the,

2070
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:26,870
the big questions I get is, you
know, oh, how much, you know,

2071
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:29,540
how long will it take and
how much can I make? Okay.

2072
02:02:29,700 --> 02:02:32,810
Then my first response is get
the fuck away from me. Okay.

2073
02:02:32,811 --> 02:02:36,520
Because you don't get it
in. And this is, and I tell,

2074
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:39,170
I tell guys that are doing
it. I said, hey, let me,

2075
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:43,180
let me explain what this is to
you. And it's, you know, you,

2076
02:02:43,181 --> 02:02:46,580
you get paid for doing what you do and I
don't know what it is and I don't care,

2077
02:02:46,940 --> 02:02:48,140
but you deserve it.

2078
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:53,470
But tell me what it's like for
Joe Rogan to walk into an arena.

2079
02:02:54,740 --> 02:02:58,640
Some of the biggest arenas in the
world. Madison Square Garden, you know,

2080
02:02:59,030 --> 02:03:03,740
t-mobile staples, no one stops you,
they don't fricking hold you back.

2081
02:03:03,770 --> 02:03:07,640
You get to walk anywhere you want in
that arena, you get to walk to the cage.

2082
02:03:07,670 --> 02:03:10,250
If you want to walk in the back and go
to the locker rooms, you can do that.

2083
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:12,500
No one stops you.
You don't pay a dime for it.

2084
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:17,120
And you get to sit and watch the greatest
fights in the world. Good Gig. Hello.

2085
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:20,120
It's priceless. It's
priceless. Yeah, I enjoy it.

2086
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:25,130
And it's exactly it because you love the
sport and it's not about how much money

2087
02:03:25,131 --> 02:03:25,491
you make.

2088
02:03:25,491 --> 02:03:29,540
It's about being a part of something and
being able to do something that other

2089
02:03:29,541 --> 02:03:33,230
people would give their left
fucking nut for sure. You know?

2090
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:36,200
And the other one that I'm
talking to them, I like,

2091
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:40,010
how much have you done to prepare
yourself for this? Because look at,

2092
02:03:40,011 --> 02:03:41,990
I started doing stuff
back when I was a kid.

2093
02:03:41,991 --> 02:03:45,650
Now I didn't do it to prepare to be an
official that just fell into my lap.

2094
02:03:46,220 --> 02:03:51,140
But all the stuff that my dad made made
me do. Okay, I'll, you know, doing,

2095
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:54,350
you know, anything that you know,
had to do with combative sports.

2096
02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:59,270
And then from there continuing
on and then you know,

2097
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:04,300
meeting Horian Gracie and going and
learning that and all of that set me up to

2098
02:04:04,430 --> 02:04:09,430
have the ability to be successful at
this sport where I tell people all the

2099
02:04:11,691 --> 02:04:14,540
time, look at it, let's,
let's look at the NFL.

2100
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:17,720
You want to be an official and you
want to do the Superbowl. Great.

2101
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:20,840
Because the UFC is the NFL,

2102
02:04:20,930 --> 02:04:24,320
two fighters and two
officials. Okay. It should be,

2103
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:28,520
but they're looking at it and they go,
I get people all the time saying,

2104
02:04:28,540 --> 02:04:30,560
oh I could do that. You know, I
would be great. I know I'd be,

2105
02:04:30,561 --> 02:04:32,870
I've been watching since
the beginning and you go,

2106
02:04:32,871 --> 02:04:37,830
you have no fucking clue because
if you want to do this in the NFL,

2107
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:39,060
how would you go about doing it?

2108
02:04:39,061 --> 02:04:41,760
Well you'd start off in peewee
football with little six year olds,

2109
02:04:41,761 --> 02:04:43,740
eight year olds doing,
you know,

2110
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:48,570
officiating on the weekends and you would
do that for a couple of years and then

2111
02:04:48,571 --> 02:04:50,190
you graduate to a higher level.

2112
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:53,130
And then finally you might even get to
high school and from high school you

2113
02:04:53,131 --> 02:04:56,010
might even get into junior
college and junior college.

2114
02:04:56,010 --> 02:04:58,170
You might start doing division three,
division two.

2115
02:04:58,230 --> 02:05:02,100
You might make it to Division One and
by the time they call and say, Hey,

2116
02:05:02,101 --> 02:05:06,240
do you want to come here and start
to do summer league for the NFL?

2117
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:11,540
You've put in 15 to 20
years of officiating and of
going through problems and

2118
02:05:12,391 --> 02:05:16,650
situations and everything and that's the
big difference that people don't get.

2119
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:18,510
Even the athletic commissions,

2120
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:24,260
they all will have somebody that has
been their guy at their state who is,

2121
02:05:25,470 --> 02:05:29,180
well, he's there for all our small
shows and he, oh, he's always, you know,

2122
02:05:29,250 --> 02:05:30,690
he's always available and
he's always doing stuff,

2123
02:05:30,691 --> 02:05:33,240
so we want to give them that bigger
shot and the UFC is coming here.

2124
02:05:33,241 --> 02:05:35,940
We want to put them in that
main event fight and you go,

2125
02:05:35,941 --> 02:05:40,941
don't do it to them because they have
no concept that when that official steps

2126
02:05:41,161 --> 02:05:45,000
into that octagon for that
very first prelim fight,

2127
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:49,530
their heart rate's at about 145
beats per minute just standing still.

2128
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:53,850
Why the adrenaline's flowing and
they're scared. They're scared because,

2129
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:58,530
oh my God, I can't make a mistake because
now I've got all these eyeballs on me.

2130
02:05:58,860 --> 02:05:59,350
All right,

2131
02:05:59,350 --> 02:06:03,810
and that's where you get all of that
knowledge is doing the small shows and

2132
02:06:03,811 --> 02:06:07,020
going through time and had seeing,
you know, having problems yourself,

2133
02:06:07,021 --> 02:06:09,300
seeing other people have those problems.
How do they deal with it?

2134
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:11,820
Talking to other officials,
what do you do in this situation?

2135
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:17,180
That's where that experience is going to
help separate you from the other people

2136
02:06:17,431 --> 02:06:21,990
and when the bad thing happens, you make
it look easy. Sometimes it's not easy.

2137
02:06:21,991 --> 02:06:25,140
Sometimes you don't make it look easy.
Sometimes it's just as a mess,

2138
02:06:25,590 --> 02:06:29,910
but it's that experience that's going
to get you out of the problem without

2139
02:06:29,911 --> 02:06:31,680
everyone wanting to take your head.
Yeah,

2140
02:06:31,681 --> 02:06:34,410
it's always an issue or it
was an issue for a while.

2141
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:39,410
At least when we would go to a new town
and they would do local guys in the

2142
02:06:40,141 --> 02:06:41,700
local guys would have to referee.

2143
02:06:41,701 --> 02:06:45,480
They wanted a certain percentage of local
guys refereeing fights and local guys

2144
02:06:45,481 --> 02:06:48,980
would do big high level fights
and make gigantic mistakes. Yup.

2145
02:06:49,140 --> 02:06:52,380
And separate guys when they were working
and separate guys when they were on the

2146
02:06:52,381 --> 02:06:56,850
ground and people would go crazy,
including me, I would go crazy too.

2147
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:01,880
Well that's because you're expecting
how certain level of competence in doing

2148
02:07:02,131 --> 02:07:05,990
that job and well, I've seen it done
this way multiple times, multiple times.

2149
02:07:06,010 --> 02:07:09,300
All of a sudden boom, something
different now it goes whoa. Right.

2150
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:13,830
And arbitrary subjective decisions that
affect professional fighters careers.

2151
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:17,900
If it's not fair, if I win and
I put you with official, I said,

2152
02:07:17,901 --> 02:07:20,770
I explained to me when you stand
somebody up, when you don't, right,

2153
02:07:20,790 --> 02:07:25,590
they're not going to do a good job of it.
Okay. I'll tell you exactly why I do it.

2154
02:07:25,591 --> 02:07:29,730
When I would do it, why I
wouldn't. Okay. Because you get,

2155
02:07:29,731 --> 02:07:31,780
you know there's positions and
you know what they are. I mean,

2156
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:36,100
when a guy takes somebody down, it's not
easy to get somebody down. Okay? Now,

2157
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:38,830
if I'm the guy getting taken
down and I close my guard,

2158
02:07:39,700 --> 02:07:43,960
grab a hold of him gable grip, pull him
in tight. Let's see, what am I doing?

2159
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:48,250
I'm stalling on the guy
underneath stalling this fight,

2160
02:07:48,310 --> 02:07:51,430
trying to get stood up because I wanted
to get stood up because I have a referee

2161
02:07:51,431 --> 02:07:55,330
that's going to stand me up because
the crowd starts to go, boo. Well,

2162
02:07:55,630 --> 02:07:59,110
I'm not being fair if,
if I'm the referee in this situation,

2163
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:00,700
I'll never stand you up.

2164
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:05,200
I'm going to give that guy in the top
position all the time in the world to get

2165
02:08:05,201 --> 02:08:09,190
past what you're doing. As long
as he's working, trying to do it,

2166
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:14,230
it's when he starts to stall in the top
position and not try to do anything and

2167
02:08:14,231 --> 02:08:18,960
just sit there. Now you're stalling to
stop stand up, but from a lot guard,

2168
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:22,240
Dale Grit. What submissions
do I have? Nothing.

2169
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:25,960
What did you think of this past
weekend with John Fitch and Paul Daley?

2170
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:29,330
We're Paul Daley was yelling out booboo.

2171
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:32,830
You know that that was a strange,
strange scene.

2172
02:08:32,860 --> 02:08:35,020
What is it come on to you?
What is it?

2173
02:08:35,050 --> 02:08:39,040
He was very frustrated with his inability
to stop. John Fitches game. Yeah.

2174
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:41,500
John Fitch game is obvious
to everybody that watches,

2175
02:08:41,501 --> 02:08:43,660
he wants to take you down and pound.
And was there any,

2176
02:08:43,930 --> 02:08:47,290
was there any doubt in your mind what
John Fitch is going to try to do in that

2177
02:08:47,291 --> 02:08:49,120
fight? Okay, so if you're Paul Daley,

2178
02:08:49,121 --> 02:08:51,760
is there any doubt in your mind what
John Fitch is going to try to do in this

2179
02:08:51,761 --> 02:08:55,120
fight and isn't any doubt would Paul
dailies can to try to do exactly right.

2180
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:55,511
Okay,

2181
02:08:55,511 --> 02:09:00,511
so because the fact that I
can't stop what he does now,

2182
02:09:00,911 --> 02:09:04,320
I'm just going to sit there and you know,
boo, I'm breaking mentally. I broken.

2183
02:09:04,330 --> 02:09:07,370
I can't stop what he's doing and
so I'm going to try it. It was,

2184
02:09:07,371 --> 02:09:12,160
he booing about the matchmaking. He boot
about everything. He booed John. He said,

2185
02:09:12,161 --> 02:09:15,550
you know, you're not fired. He booed
a bellatore. He booed the crowd.

2186
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:19,540
He pooed everything because you know,

2187
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:24,160
there's that point where we all,
you know, I can't get out of this.

2188
02:09:24,190 --> 02:09:27,160
Why doesn't Paul daily just kickbox.
You know what?

2189
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:31,810
I talked to him before the fight
and he seemed like he was, you know,

2190
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:36,490
mentally better off and he was
happy. And you look and you go, hey,

2191
02:09:36,491 --> 02:09:39,640
you know what you're getting
yourself into. I mean, here's a guy,

2192
02:09:40,150 --> 02:09:44,500
when you look at it, Joe, he really
has 32 knockouts in 40 victories.

2193
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:47,210
You know what he's going to do.
Okay.

2194
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:51,260
And he has explosive
lefthand from hell man,

2195
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:54,550
his left hand when it hits you and I
don't care where it hits you h in the top

2196
02:09:54,551 --> 02:09:59,200
of the head, even block it,
you know, so you know what
he's gonna do. And it's like,

2197
02:09:59,230 --> 02:10:03,580
if you don't want to be that guy,
that can be taken down,

2198
02:10:03,581 --> 02:10:07,900
stop doing this sport because this is
part of the sport. It is not a matter of,

2199
02:10:07,901 --> 02:10:11,620
well, I th I want to be able to fight
standing up because it's more exciting.

2200
02:10:11,621 --> 02:10:14,680
Have you ever talked to him about, I have.
What does he say? Yeah, he goes, he says,

2201
02:10:14,681 --> 02:10:17,890
I just use the grappling is boring.
Then stop it. Wait a minute.

2202
02:10:17,891 --> 02:10:22,810
The grappling is boring. Well, why does
it need just kickbox alo? And he has,

2203
02:10:22,811 --> 02:10:25,900
he has, he kickbox to when they
have the dynamite card. Yeah,

2204
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:29,140
but why doesn't he just do that? I
mean, he's a fucking dynamite striker.

2205
02:10:29,170 --> 02:10:34,080
He is a phenomenal kickboxer. But there's
a difference. You know, I, and I'm,

2206
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:38,960
you know, you know, look, you can
take some kickboxers out there. Okay.

2207
02:10:39,350 --> 02:10:42,620
And put them in an MMA fight.
They're in trouble. Yeah, but man,

2208
02:10:42,621 --> 02:10:47,000
you put them in a kickboxing fight.
Those dudes are phenomenal.

2209
02:10:47,450 --> 02:10:50,630
And just the fact that what they do,

2210
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:55,490
they cannot do in an MMA cage because
the ability for them to be taken down,

2211
02:10:55,491 --> 02:10:59,540
it stops them from trying to do some
of those things. Well, with Paul,

2212
02:10:59,600 --> 02:11:03,350
Paul is that guy, he's the, he's
the high level striker in MMA.

2213
02:11:04,070 --> 02:11:06,980
Put 'em in kickboxing against some
certain guys. Hey, you know what?

2214
02:11:06,981 --> 02:11:08,750
There's guys out there,
they're going to,

2215
02:11:08,751 --> 02:11:12,290
he's going to wish you could go to
the ground. Let's just be honest.

2216
02:11:12,291 --> 02:11:16,380
He's that guy. He's kind of in the
Middle Lane. He's a tweener. Yeah,

2217
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:18,530
man.
I just phenomenal fighter.

2218
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:22,220
But I feel like if he fully concentrated
on kickbox and maybe that would be the

2219
02:11:22,221 --> 02:11:26,150
thing. Yeah, it's just, to me it doesn't
make any sense. Like I was watching that.

2220
02:11:26,150 --> 02:11:30,530
I was like, man, this is like
career implosion. Watching
him. I felt bad for him.

2221
02:11:30,531 --> 02:11:32,030
I really did.
You know?

2222
02:11:32,031 --> 02:11:35,150
And I felt bad for him not because
he was losing the fight. Right.

2223
02:11:35,210 --> 02:11:38,450
I feel bad for him that you know what?
You're making such bad choices.

2224
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:42,060
That was a bad choice and enjoying things.
Ultimate frustrated.

2225
02:11:42,080 --> 02:11:44,600
It just makes you look bad.
I mean,

2226
02:11:44,601 --> 02:11:47,750
he's just stuck in this situation where
he just doesn't seem like he can get out

2227
02:11:47,751 --> 02:11:50,810
of it, you know? And look at it when he,

2228
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:54,980
in the end of the first round
and when he went after John, hey,

2229
02:11:54,981 --> 02:11:57,800
no one's sitting there saying, stop. Let's
put you on the ground. Right. Of course.

2230
02:11:57,830 --> 02:12:00,710
Okay. Because you have an advantage
here. You're utilizing that advantage.

2231
02:12:00,711 --> 02:12:01,544
Good for you.

2232
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:06,470
But John fought the exact fight that
you would expect him to try to fight

2233
02:12:06,471 --> 02:12:10,040
against a guy like Paul Daley. I mean,
it's amazing that John is still swinging.

2234
02:12:10,370 --> 02:12:14,900
He looks better. John looked
better physically, mentally,

2235
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:16,140
everything.
He,

2236
02:12:16,170 --> 02:12:19,580
he had a lot of problems and I talked to
him about those problems and you know,

2237
02:12:19,581 --> 02:12:24,290
he was messed up. His neck was completely
screwed up. He actually switched,

2238
02:12:24,291 --> 02:12:25,460
you know, he talked about it. He goes,

2239
02:12:25,461 --> 02:12:29,420
I had to switch to a southpaw to fight
Jake shields because if I got hit

2240
02:12:29,421 --> 02:12:32,150
standing right handed, I got hit.
My head went that way. He goes,

2241
02:12:32,151 --> 02:12:35,420
my entire arm would go numb and
I couldn't feel it. Whoa. Yeah.

2242
02:12:35,421 --> 02:12:38,570
And there was a lot of things. He says it.
He goes, I've, I've got all that fixed.

2243
02:12:38,571 --> 02:12:41,540
And he did. He's fixed it and not through
surgery. He had doctors telling him,

2244
02:12:41,541 --> 02:12:45,440
you need surgery.
And he's done it through physical therapy,

2245
02:12:45,470 --> 02:12:48,470
exercise and nutrition that he believes.
He goes,

2246
02:12:48,471 --> 02:12:51,050
I don't have the same problems anymore.
He said, he goes, I was taking,

2247
02:12:51,051 --> 02:12:53,380
I was utilizing a lot of
marijuana to take care of painter.

2248
02:12:53,390 --> 02:12:56,840
I don't do that anymore. You
know, he's a, that's a pity.

2249
02:13:00,350 --> 02:13:03,920
But I know a, he tried veganism for
a while, but he said it made him,

2250
02:13:03,950 --> 02:13:07,250
made him feel weak and then went back
to eating meat and he said that really

2251
02:13:07,251 --> 02:13:10,430
made him feel better. And then I know
he'd gone through a bunch of things,

2252
02:13:10,431 --> 02:13:12,320
but I wasn't aware of
his neck injury big time.

2253
02:13:12,740 --> 02:13:14,840
So it was a bulging disc or
something along those lines.

2254
02:13:15,410 --> 02:13:20,410
Stenosis and bulging disc and big problems
with he would get hit and his entire

2255
02:13:20,781 --> 02:13:24,650
side would go. And how did he fix
that? I mean, what could you know,

2256
02:13:24,740 --> 02:13:26,930
in talking to him, he said, I, I've,

2257
02:13:26,990 --> 02:13:29,840
I started doing a nutritional and he says,

2258
02:13:29,841 --> 02:13:32,160
I take like 40 different
pills a day that he's,

2259
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:35,220
I wish I could, I wish I could
remember the guy who said them.

2260
02:13:35,221 --> 02:13:37,350
I don't mean medication.
No. Yeah, supplements,

2261
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:41,970
supplements for bone things and,
and opening of,

2262
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:46,240
of uh, blood vessels and
all these different things.
I'd love to hear about that.

2263
02:13:46,490 --> 02:13:48,090
It's really interesting.
It is interesting and it's,

2264
02:13:48,150 --> 02:13:53,150
it's great that he was able to find that
person that what this guy told them to

2265
02:13:53,161 --> 02:13:56,400
do has worked for them. Well, you know,
Jake had gone through a similar situation.

2266
02:13:56,401 --> 02:13:58,740
He had a back injury and the doctors
are telling them to stop fighting.

2267
02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:02,370
They would tell him, stop fighting. Stop.
That's, well that's, that's a doctor's,

2268
02:14:02,371 --> 02:14:04,930
you know thing all the time. You
can't do it anymore. You know,

2269
02:14:04,931 --> 02:14:08,400
and you can sit there at any paths.
He hands a movie actually.

2270
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:13,170
But I know the actual scene. I know
what actually really happened to Vinny,

2271
02:14:13,230 --> 02:14:17,010
you know, with a broken neck. Yeah. I mean
they told them you're done. He's like, no,

2272
02:14:17,011 --> 02:14:20,880
I'm not. Yeah, he went on to have some
of his best fights. Absolutely. Yeah.

2273
02:14:20,881 --> 02:14:23,270
But then again, sometimes
you are done. I mean it's,

2274
02:14:23,271 --> 02:14:24,900
it's hard to make that distinction.

2275
02:14:24,901 --> 02:14:28,860
Like when do you know when your body is
broken to the point of no repair? Well,

2276
02:14:28,861 --> 02:14:33,510
you know, it comes down to everyone. I
don't care who you know, you, me, anybody,

2277
02:14:34,050 --> 02:14:39,050
you know the difference
between you physically now
at the age of 50 compared to

2278
02:14:40,111 --> 02:14:43,020
what you physically could do
at the age of 30 you know,

2279
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:46,380
there's a big difference and it just,
you know, father time's undefeated,

2280
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:50,340
beat starts to go and everything
starts to go mentally.

2281
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:54,450
You're way smarter now. Well,
that's why TRT was so dangerous.

2282
02:14:54,830 --> 02:14:59,070
Like the TRT v toward days.
You got a guy who's 37 years old,

2283
02:14:59,190 --> 02:14:59,911
much smarter,

2284
02:14:59,911 --> 02:15:03,810
who's also hopped up on apple sauce and
throwing fucking wheel kicks at people.

2285
02:15:04,050 --> 02:15:05,340
And there's just a different,

2286
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:08,760
he was a different animal because he
had so much knowledge behind them,

2287
02:15:08,761 --> 02:15:13,320
but his body was moving like a young man's
body. Yup. Yeah. Which is interesting.

2288
02:15:13,321 --> 02:15:15,730
It's like you're, you're
hacking father time. You're,

2289
02:15:16,050 --> 02:15:19,970
you've got all that knowledge,
wisdom and discipline. Look at it.

2290
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:21,660
The more knowledge you have,
the better off you are.

2291
02:15:22,340 --> 02:15:24,990
And I have a whole lot of old
[inaudible] stories when he was young,

2292
02:15:24,991 --> 02:15:29,940
when look at it, he was mentally God.
God gives everybody certain things,

2293
02:15:30,270 --> 02:15:33,110
but very rarely does he give
them everything you know.

2294
02:15:33,180 --> 02:15:36,440
But physically he blessed VTR.

2295
02:15:36,870 --> 02:15:41,580
Physically Vittorio was fast.
Oh yeah. He had good strength.

2296
02:15:41,581 --> 02:15:45,660
He was, you know, balance wise, he was
great. All kinds of credible. Yeah.

2297
02:15:46,290 --> 02:15:50,910
But up here, that was where he was
lacking. It wasn't that he was stupid,

2298
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:55,170
but he lacked confidence and he would
have to have people telling him that he

2299
02:15:55,171 --> 02:15:59,790
could do stuff all the time. And because
he never believed in himself. Later on,

2300
02:16:00,090 --> 02:16:04,260
he started to believe in himself. He
started, he matured. And you know, that's,

2301
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:09,480
that's what a successful person does.
Yeah. I mean that's a thing too,

2302
02:16:09,481 --> 02:16:12,180
that people have to realize those low
points in your life where you don't

2303
02:16:12,181 --> 02:16:15,570
believe in yourself. That doesn't define
you. That's just you at that moment.

2304
02:16:15,571 --> 02:16:16,770
And you can improve on that.

2305
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:19,830
So many people just go through
this life thinking who they are,

2306
02:16:19,831 --> 02:16:23,160
is who they will be forever. Know who
you are is what you make. Yeah. I mean,

2307
02:16:23,161 --> 02:16:23,731
if that's the case,

2308
02:16:23,731 --> 02:16:26,730
like I'd still be that fucking
idiot who I was in high school.

2309
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:30,010
I was on big idiot. Everybody was,
I'm embarrassed by this stuff I

2310
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,870
used to do.
Of course you shouldn't be in is like,

2311
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:35,710
just knows Christ what an
ass I was. Especially people
that have a lot of energy,

2312
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:39,810
right? You have a lot of
energy and enthusiasm. You
make giant colossal mistakes.

2313
02:16:39,830 --> 02:16:43,510
Then you're like raw and then you think
about yourself. You're like, is that me?

2314
02:16:43,930 --> 02:16:47,470
You're not even the same person you were
a year ago. He no one is your, your con.

2315
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:50,860
If you're paying attention and you're
learning from life's mistakes and life's

2316
02:16:50,861 --> 02:16:53,890
decisions and all the
trials and tribulations,

2317
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:58,480
you should theoretically at least be
improving in the way you approach life

2318
02:16:58,510 --> 02:17:02,080
every day. You really should be.
Should be, and then with fighting,

2319
02:17:02,081 --> 02:17:05,770
those things are highlighted because
you only fight if you're lucky two,

2320
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:08,570
three times a year, you
know, unless your, you know,

2321
02:17:09,010 --> 02:17:12,430
Jeremy Horn and he was fighting
all over the place and you know,

2322
02:17:12,431 --> 02:17:16,660
or Travis Walton. Hello. I think Travis
is well over 200 fights now, right?

2323
02:17:16,661 --> 02:17:18,760
He's still fighting while he
fights boxing, I've done it.

2324
02:17:18,761 --> 02:17:22,300
I've done boxing matches with the brazy
how many fights that guy has and he

2325
02:17:22,301 --> 02:17:27,220
seems fine. He is. That's
nuts. That's genetics.

2326
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:31,390
There's certain people, I don't care
what anyone wants to say. Oh, it's true.

2327
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:36,220
There's certain people that they're
predisposed. If they get head trauma,

2328
02:17:36,580 --> 02:17:39,010
they're going to have problems
and there are certain people do.

2329
02:17:39,030 --> 02:17:42,280
You could hit him in the
head with everything you
have for as long as you want

2330
02:17:42,281 --> 02:17:44,230
and they're just going to be
fine. Yeah, there's a certain,

2331
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:47,830
there's certain guys that one or two
knockouts and they're basically done.

2332
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:51,910
It's just one or two that was
Freddie Roach look at, you know,

2333
02:17:52,690 --> 02:17:56,470
if you go back and use, you know,
Eddie Fudge was Freddy Roach.

2334
02:17:56,471 --> 02:18:01,120
His trainer he flushed was the trainer
for Joe Frazier during his, you know,

2335
02:18:01,900 --> 02:18:03,950
like Thrilla in Manila against,
uh,

2336
02:18:04,030 --> 02:18:08,290
Muhammad Ali and Eddie fetches the one
that pulled Joe Frazier out of that fight

2337
02:18:08,291 --> 02:18:13,120
when he was winning the fight in the,
between the 14th and 15th round, right?

2338
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:14,770
When Muhammad Ali was going to say,

2339
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:19,290
I can't go back out there and Eddie Fudge
because Joe Frazier couldn't see, says,

2340
02:18:19,291 --> 02:18:19,900
you're done.

2341
02:18:19,900 --> 02:18:22,450
I'm not going to let you back out there
because he cared when it's the right

2342
02:18:22,451 --> 02:18:25,930
thing. But he was the trainer of
Freddie Roach and Freddie Roach.

2343
02:18:25,931 --> 02:18:28,300
I think it was 14 to know
when he lost his first fight.

2344
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:33,430
And you watch at that point
when he gets knocked out,

2345
02:18:33,940 --> 02:18:37,170
Eddie Fudge told him, son,
you're done. You don't,

2346
02:18:37,180 --> 02:18:40,780
you shouldn't fight anymore because
he's seeing something in him now.

2347
02:18:40,810 --> 02:18:42,280
Freddie Roach goes,
you're crazy.

2348
02:18:42,281 --> 02:18:46,440
I lost one fight and he goes with
somebody else and starts to add,

2349
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,700
but he progressively goes down.

2350
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:52,390
His box can goes away and he probably
saw something in the gym as well.

2351
02:18:52,810 --> 02:18:55,960
Absolutely he did. Cause it's every
day that he's with me. You can see it,

2352
02:18:56,580 --> 02:18:58,000
you know,
and it's a hard thing man.

2353
02:18:58,050 --> 02:19:02,080
Cause you care about that person
and it is part of your livelihood.

2354
02:19:02,081 --> 02:19:04,120
You're working with them.
You do get paid through them,

2355
02:19:04,121 --> 02:19:07,180
but you do care about that person.

2356
02:19:07,181 --> 02:19:10,180
You don't want to see him go
down and you know that happens.

2357
02:19:10,430 --> 02:19:15,280
How's it for you when you were being
a referee and you were seeing guys who

2358
02:19:15,281 --> 02:19:17,290
probably shouldn't be doing anymore?
Kills me.

2359
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:20,890
People when it comes to refereeing,

2360
02:19:20,891 --> 02:19:25,420
what they don't understand
is you're responsible.

2361
02:19:26,050 --> 02:19:26,883
Okay.

2362
02:19:26,990 --> 02:19:31,990
You're that last level of responsibility
for the fighters and the on the,

2363
02:19:33,161 --> 02:19:35,660
the, the matchmakers put the
fight together. You know,

2364
02:19:35,710 --> 02:19:37,280
the promoter promotes that fight.

2365
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:41,120
The Athletic Commission
approves that fight and then
puts you in there with them.

2366
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:42,110
And you know,

2367
02:19:42,110 --> 02:19:45,200
I can tell you there's sometimes they
give you what I call a shit sandwich.

2368
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:49,580
You know, this is bad from the beginning,
but you deal with it and you handle it.

2369
02:19:49,580 --> 02:19:54,410
But what people, what fans don't
understand is, you know, as a,

2370
02:19:54,411 --> 02:19:56,490
as a reference,
I never care.

2371
02:19:56,491 --> 02:20:01,030
There's only been one time that I
ever cared who want to fight. Okay.

2372
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:05,750
One time. What was that?
Marilla Bustamante versus
Matt Lindland. I screwed up.

2373
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:11,250
I screwed up and trust me
from that point. Well, I'll,

2374
02:20:11,300 --> 02:20:15,770
I'll explain it real quick. Matt Lindland,
uh, got caught in an arm bar, tapped,

2375
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:19,810
said he didn't tap. You listen to
him, you said, okay, go back again.

2376
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:23,690
He's like Jesus Christ. And then you
realize you'd made this big mistake, huge.

2377
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:27,920
Matt Lindland who was a great competitor
but maybe perhaps a little bit over

2378
02:20:27,921 --> 02:20:31,290
enthusiastic about the outcome, was
willing to bend the rules a little bit.

2379
02:20:31,630 --> 02:20:34,730
And that's his job. I don't
have a problem with that. Sure.

2380
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:39,760
The problem is the referee
who is not decisive too bad,

2381
02:20:41,170 --> 02:20:44,480
cause I, I second guessed
myself and I said, oh my God,

2382
02:20:44,481 --> 02:20:49,070
cause it wasn't a tab so enthusiastic
about adamant about John. I did not.

2383
02:20:49,071 --> 02:20:51,290
And it's like, did I
make a mistake? Right.

2384
02:20:51,291 --> 02:20:53,720
And at the time I could have
no instant replay and I,

2385
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:54,790
well I couldn't put them back in the,

2386
02:20:54,791 --> 02:20:58,460
even in the same position because at
the time if I interfered with the fight,

2387
02:20:58,550 --> 02:21:03,550
the rule said that I must put them to
their corners and restart the fight.

2388
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:08,240
Wow. So you just ate it. Oh
yeah. Well you just ate it.

2389
02:21:09,230 --> 02:21:12,740
Marillo eight it really felt horrible.
He came back,

2390
02:21:13,230 --> 02:21:18,170
he came another full round, I believe
it went into that next round. Yeah. Yup.

2391
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:18,620
Yeah.

2392
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:23,270
And I felt dude to this day
that still drives me crazy.

2393
02:21:23,360 --> 02:21:27,650
But really it was a guy that people
forget. Oh, he was one of the very,

2394
02:21:28,580 --> 02:21:33,260
another crossing guy, but just
phenomenal Jujitsu. Just, I mean,

2395
02:21:33,261 --> 02:21:36,170
when he was in his prime,
when he was at UFC middleweight champion,

2396
02:21:36,290 --> 02:21:39,530
he left the UFC as the middleweight
champion, I believe. No.

2397
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:42,410
Did he lose the title in the UFC?
I'm trying to release too.

2398
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:46,130
I feel like you left as champion.
He might of,

2399
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:49,550
I think he left his champion and went
to pride. If I remember correctly.

2400
02:21:50,030 --> 02:21:54,210
I'm foggy on this guys. He got beat
by Dan Henderson in pride. Yup. Yeah.

2401
02:21:54,690 --> 02:21:58,650
He might've walked out, walked
away and gone there. You're
right. But he, you know,

2402
02:21:58,910 --> 02:22:02,030
he was never,
when he fought big Tom Erickson,

2403
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:04,770
that fucking started.
See,

2404
02:22:04,870 --> 02:22:08,390
they're right there at that
fight and people talk about
the rules and that fight.

2405
02:22:08,570 --> 02:22:11,960
There's a rule because of it. Yeah. When
you sit there and you have a fighter,

2406
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:16,250
you had Tom Erickson being
the big 290 pound wrestler.

2407
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:20,630
He was fucking huge. The
cat, big cat against Marillo.

2408
02:22:20,660 --> 02:22:24,380
He goes to the ground with
Marillo and goes, fuck that.

2409
02:22:24,381 --> 02:22:27,900
I'm not going to be on the ground. This
cow, I'm in danger. He gets up and says,

2410
02:22:27,901 --> 02:22:30,690
I'm going to be a boxer. And rural is
like, I don't want to stand up with that.

2411
02:22:30,830 --> 02:22:33,690
I do hits hard for it too.
You may not be good with what he's doing,

2412
02:22:33,691 --> 02:22:34,590
but he's still hits hard.

2413
02:22:34,930 --> 02:22:38,220
And I remember when he knocked out
Kevin Randleman in Brazil. Oh yeah.

2414
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:41,590
Ooh Tom. Eric starts
fucking bang. Oh yeah.

2415
02:22:41,690 --> 02:22:46,560
But Marillo is chasing him on his
butt and Erickson's backing away.

2416
02:22:46,870 --> 02:22:50,010
It looked horrible. So we said at that,
that was when we came up with, look at,

2417
02:22:50,760 --> 02:22:53,730
we've got to have one fighter in control
of it. The person that's standing,

2418
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:58,400
if they back away from their opponent
and you'll know to this day you watched

2419
02:22:58,401 --> 02:23:00,720
fighters, you see the referee
coming and you got to get up.

2420
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:04,580
That was like a three hour, I mean, not a
three hour, 30 minute fight right there,

2421
02:23:04,590 --> 02:23:09,060
isn't it? It's one of those crazy ones.
Yeah, it was. It was. It was horrible.

2422
02:23:09,061 --> 02:23:11,730
But it taught us a lot.
Wasn't that the same event?

2423
02:23:11,731 --> 02:23:14,330
We're all [inaudible]
up kicked or a hands up,

2424
02:23:14,331 --> 02:23:17,490
hands up kicked Olig
tech tar off Mars event.

2425
02:23:18,730 --> 02:23:23,040
Mars event.
Would that stand for martial arts reality.

2426
02:23:23,041 --> 02:23:23,874
Super fights.

2427
02:23:26,790 --> 02:23:28,070
Why do people like that?

2428
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:31,560
I tried to get away from an
LAPD cause that's all they did.

2429
02:23:31,720 --> 02:23:34,350
Well because the UFC is so good.
It's such a good acronym.

2430
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:37,430
That's an [inaudible] an acronym though.
That's just the initials, that piece,

2431
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:41,190
right? You're right, you're right.
It's not like Mars. The just,

2432
02:23:41,220 --> 02:23:43,980
what is it called when it's not in
an acronym and it's three to just an

2433
02:23:43,981 --> 02:23:48,050
abbreviation. What is it? No,
it's like NFL. What is that
called? I forget that word.

2434
02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:51,190
I just learned. I never, I
never know that word. Um,

2435
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:54,310
but people just try to recreate
something like that. You know,

2436
02:23:54,490 --> 02:23:58,530
they try to the IFC or whatever the
fuck they try to come up with something.

2437
02:23:58,710 --> 02:23:59,550
Well you look,

2438
02:23:59,551 --> 02:24:03,390
you'd talk to Lorenzo and you know his
thing was in the end I bought three

2439
02:24:03,391 --> 02:24:07,800
letters. Yeah. About the U
F C and the Octagon. Yeah.

2440
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:12,570
Yeah. Cause all this day, right? Bell
has to use a circle. Circles better.

2441
02:24:12,820 --> 02:24:15,780
Ooh, no, that has nothing to talk.

2442
02:24:15,781 --> 02:24:20,650
And Chat has nothing to do with,
it has nothing to do with us.

2443
02:24:21,950 --> 02:24:26,730
You talk about your basketball court?
Well, any corner creates a problem.

2444
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:27,570
I get it.

2445
02:24:27,570 --> 02:24:32,550
So the circle at least is there's nothing
different in any section of that to

2446
02:24:32,551 --> 02:24:36,150
where that those two points come
together for the the octagon.

2447
02:24:36,210 --> 02:24:37,840
I can see that logic and it's no,

2448
02:24:38,050 --> 02:24:43,050
I still look at the safest environment
for fighters is actually the cage because

2449
02:24:44,281 --> 02:24:47,160
it contains them.
If you watch Bella toward kickboxing,

2450
02:24:47,820 --> 02:24:52,820
you see that what they do is they do a
kickboxing and an MMA show in the same

2451
02:24:52,921 --> 02:24:53,970
night.
Same Day.

2452
02:24:54,150 --> 02:24:58,440
I was just going to say that I think
they do the best ring for boxing and why?

2453
02:24:58,540 --> 02:25:02,350
Well, I can't fall out of it. When Bernard
Hopkins and his last price minutes,

2454
02:25:02,370 --> 02:25:03,203
Joe Smith,

2455
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:06,420
he got knocked out and fell through and
hit his fucking head on the ground. Yeah,

2456
02:25:06,450 --> 02:25:07,470
it was a terrible law.

2457
02:25:07,500 --> 02:25:09,750
I mean this is the guy who was
one of the greatest of all time,

2458
02:25:09,780 --> 02:25:12,630
but you'd look at the ropes compared
to the end of the not much space.

2459
02:25:12,631 --> 02:25:16,860
It's ridiculous. Whereas the ring
sitting in the belt or cage circle,

2460
02:25:16,890 --> 02:25:20,760
there's plenty of room every fall say
roof. It's all safe. Yup. Yeah, I agree.

2461
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,220
I think it's smart, but she'll
get promoters that don't want that

2462
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:28,780
because it takes away seating. Ah,
based on the ground sisters. Yup.

2463
02:25:29,050 --> 02:25:33,550
Monsters. It's crazy. But that's the way
they are. Well, listen, big John. Uh,

2464
02:25:33,551 --> 02:25:36,670
glad we finally got a chance to do this.
It's been a pleasure to be your friend.

2465
02:25:36,700 --> 02:25:40,540
It's been a pleasure knowing you all
these years and you are the Oge of ogs.

2466
02:25:40,630 --> 02:25:43,540
Thank you. I appreciate it. Let's
do this again sometime. Absolutely.

2467
02:25:44,050 --> 02:25:46,630
And congratulations on
your success with valador.

2468
02:25:46,660 --> 02:25:49,120
I think you're doing a great
job over there and I really,

2469
02:25:49,370 --> 02:25:52,270
I'm happy they're doing really well too.
Thank you brother. I appreciate it, man.

2470
02:25:52,271 --> 02:25:54,540
Big John McCarthy.
Motherfuckers respect.
