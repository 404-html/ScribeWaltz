1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,190
I asked us historian and my podcast if
they were really that bad and he spent

3
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,540
his life studying the Mongols.

4
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:06,781
I said,

5
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:06,871
no,

6
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:07,501
they really that bad.

7
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:08,010
And he said,

8
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,790
yeah,

9
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,421
they were really,

10
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:09,920
there is no,

11
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,240
well there were Great Wall of China.

12
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,670
The Great Wall of China was
built to keep the Mongols out.

13
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,820
And uh,

14
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,501
if you go there now,

15
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:16,951
I was just,

16
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,810
I just got back from China on Monday.

17
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,640
I went to the Great
Wall like two weeks ago,

18
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:23,730
but the first time I went to the
Great Wall was about 12 years ago.

19
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,690
And,

20
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:24,930
uh,

21
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,960
there's Mongolian people
hang out on the top,

22
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:31,920
just a few of them that are like selling
things like woman selling postcards and

23
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:32,754
cheap stuff.

24
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,630
And uh,

25
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,430
I bought some postcards.

26
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,211
It was like a dollar.

27
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:37,290
I gave the woman a 10.

28
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,760
She wouldn't give me the change.

29
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,541
Uh,

30
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,230
so it's,

31
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:40,480
you know,

32
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,070
the change,

33
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,640
they might,

34
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,060
uh,

35
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,950
be rotten people historically,

36
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:46,410
but I also want to remind you that
they'll cheat yet the Great Wall,

37
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,530
Tom,

38
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,280
that's outrageous.

39
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,010
So she wouldn't eat the Great Wall.

40
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,440
She wouldn't give you change.

41
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:53,280
How did that go down?

42
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,250
Uh,

43
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,083
you know,

44
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,221
good friend,

45
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:57,001
good friends,

46
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:57,301
you know,

47
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:58,620
it was just fun to keep the money.

48
00:00:58,621 --> 00:00:59,290
It was awkward.

49
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,100
Yeah.

50
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,470
Friends.

51
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,730
Yeah,

52
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,110
yeah,

53
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,580
yeah,

54
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,260
yeah.

55
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,720
Good for interested friend.

56
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,471
Uh,

57
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:05,640
I would just set the Great Wall.

58
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,631
And again,

59
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:07,464
did you get your money?

60
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:07,891
Uh,

61
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:08,724
I didn't.

62
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,550
They,

63
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,050
they,

64
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,861
there was a few.

65
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:13,890
They're selling like cokes
and some different trinkets.

66
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:14,341
I didn't,

67
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,000
uh,

68
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,110
I didn't fall for it this time.

69
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,690
It's crazy at the wall.

70
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,461
I never got it back.

71
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:21,100
No,

72
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,480
no,

73
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:21,661
no,

74
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:22,100
no.

75
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,471
Uh,

76
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:27,471
I have a detailed questionnaire at the
Great Wall is a twosie Kangan he had my

77
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:28,801
friend,

78
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,634
my good friend.

79
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,700
I got a video on Youtube,

80
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,300
uh,

81
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,930
Beijing,

82
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,381
Tom Rhodes,

83
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:34,980
Beijing,

84
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,641
and it's on there.

85
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:36,900
I had my camera running.

86
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,291
Oh,

87
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,270
you could see the woman as a
woman and giving me the change.

88
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:40,511
It's just so,

89
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,330
it's in my little Beijing video.

90
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:43,650
And what's the title again?

91
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,341
It's Tom Rhodes,

92
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:45,174
Beijing.

93
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,010
Uh,

94
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:46,460
and Wa.

95
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,200
And what's in that video
also is the greatest thing.

96
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,880
As great as the Great Wall is,

97
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,200
there is a Toboggan
slide that you'd go down.

98
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,093
It's a little,

99
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,521
you get it.

100
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:59,550
Sit on like a little luge plastic thing
and you've got to stick between your

101
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:03,750
legs and you push it forward to go fast
and pull it back to slow down and it's

102
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:06,030
windy and it's got some huge drops in it.

103
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,111
And I went there.

104
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:07,771
I don't remember that.

105
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:08,011
Damn.

106
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:08,670
There's three,

107
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,960
there's three sections.

108
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,460
This tourists can go to the Great Wall
and there's only the one section that has

109
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:15,510
this fantastic,

110
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,890
magnificent slide,

111
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:17,250
right?

112
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,150
And it's thrilling.

113
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:20,310
And then you get down to the
bottom and there's a big,

114
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,050
it's on that Beijing video.

115
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:23,160
I filmed it while I did it.

116
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,120
I just did it again a few
weeks ago and at the bottom,

117
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:27,570
uh,

118
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,560
are there,

119
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:29,394
it is exactly.

120
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,533
Uh,

121
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,910
there's some Chinese soldier,

122
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,660
communist guys with like military jackets
on down at the bottom on these big

123
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:37,740
turns going slow down,

124
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,590
slow down or move because obviously
they've had a few people like fly all flip

125
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:42,810
off the corners.

126
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,793
Oh my God.

127
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,183
And you good.

128
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,320
How are you slowing down?

129
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,110
How do you slow it down?

130
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,641
What you just,

131
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:49,320
you pull the stick towards you.

132
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,580
Oh my God.

133
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,010
And I did it.

134
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,790
I wouldn't see that was in
winter when I first went,

135
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,980
but I just did it again,

136
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:56,251
man.

137
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:56,890
It's,

138
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,540
it's,

139
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,010
I wanted to go right back up to the top.

140
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,191
That's great.

141
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,024
It's a Great Wall is,

142
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,100
I think that slide is even cooler and
that's so avoid the Mongols at the top.

143
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,720
I want to see the Mongol footage.

144
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,220
I want to see that broader thing.

145
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,260
The only manmade structure,

146
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:12,880
from what I understand
that you can see fairly.

147
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:13,840
That's horse shit.

148
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,900
I said that to where it is.

149
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:17,734
Here it is.

150
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,540
Oh yeah,

151
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:18,730
yeah.

152
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,540
There's some Mongolia.

153
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,373
Peachy.

154
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,250
You look at [inaudible]
with the snow on it.

155
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,750
Okay.

156
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,583
10 cars.

157
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,033
Alango oh,

158
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,280
oh $1 or two per,

159
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,030
we're talking dog shit.

160
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:32,760
All right.

161
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,593
How much is a,

162
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,381
what's that?

163
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:34,950
10.

164
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,783
10 yeah.

165
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,540
Good change.

166
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,700
Okay.

167
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,370
When you do that,

168
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,203
uh,

169
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,300
yeah.

170
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,080
Where's my chain?

171
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,913
Let's go.

172
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:44,810
No,

173
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,030
no,

174
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,300
10 10 sorry.

175
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,560
Can we all one one thing?

176
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,850
No,

177
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,683
one 10

178
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,983
the Great Wall.

179
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,933
Give me one of them.

180
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,720
Okay,

181
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,553
and then where are you?

182
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,340
Okay.

183
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:58,740
All right.

184
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,050
Thank you.

185
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,540
Sounds to me like you asked her a 10
I gave her 10 it was a dollar for the

186
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,240
postcards,

187
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,073
right?

188
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:05,820
Yeah.

189
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,653
10 Oh,

190
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,230
okay.

191
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,880
Well very good.

192
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:07,990
Well,

193
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,611
if you go back,

194
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:09,890
I think it was a miscommunication.

195
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,210
No,

196
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,850
she thought you were paying 10 bucks.

197
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,960
That's what it sounded like to me.

198
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,170
Then cars fully.

199
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,820
What was how I trust on
dollar and get it all right.

200
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,570
How much is 10 10 yeah.

201
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,370
10 10 yeah.

202
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,160
The change.

203
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,680
The change.

204
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,460
Change.

205
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,293
Okay.

206
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:30,660
Okay,

207
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,493
so she didn't change.

208
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,550
She did say change.

209
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:33,384
I change.

210
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,640
What can we all a one time change?

211
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,870
She's pushy to look at her.

212
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:39,704
She's Kinda like,

213
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,803
she slapped you.

214
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,540
She's every bit as you are by the way,

215
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,270
and then where are you
should probably eat you.

216
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,190
Yeah.

217
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,023
No one's around.

218
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,740
I guess I just spent three weeks
in China and she probably wouldn't

219
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:51,771
eat.

220
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,140
You look the by drink my
horses gave you that too.

221
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,820
Is that the compensation?

222
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,391
That was it.

223
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:56,571
Yeah.

224
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:57,950
That's actually not bad deal.

225
00:04:57,951 --> 00:04:58,560
That wasn't a bad.

226
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,420
Got a cold metal dude.

227
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,111
You won.

228
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:00,940
You won the bronze.

229
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,773
Exactly.

230
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,830
I just got back from China on Monday.

231
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:04,491
And it's,

232
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:05,031
I have to say,

233
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:07,580
the nice thing about our country
is the price is the price.

234
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,780
You don't have to,

235
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,360
how much is this a 200 are you kidding me?

236
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,194
That's,

237
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:13,670
you know,

238
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,560
they'll give you like the highest price.

239
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,060
You want to buy something and you know,

240
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:18,150
it's only a couple dollars.

241
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:18,891
And you say,

242
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:21,980
how much is that $80 Turkey Turkey was,

243
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:24,770
there's no way that that can
be $80 and then you get home,

244
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,940
you're like halfway.

245
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,340
Why don't you just tell me what you need?

246
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:28,791
Yeah,

247
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,310
this is all I want to hear
Tom Rhodes to tell a story,

248
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:31,910
please.

249
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,990
So I was just in Hong Kong
a few weeks ago and uh,

250
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,570
I remembered this story of something
that happened to me the very first time I

251
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:43,340
went to Hong Kong was like 12 years ago.

252
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,460
And I'd never been to Hong Kong
and China and I was really excited.

253
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:47,294
And one of the it,

254
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,880
I was staying at the Shangri la hotel,

255
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,460
the most opulent,

256
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:53,121
fancy,

257
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:55,340
luxurious hotel I've ever been in my life.

258
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:56,174
I mean above,

259
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,010
beyond Fivestars,

260
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,240
just swank.

261
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,400
And so the first day I just walked and
walked and I'm wanting to soak a as much

262
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,680
of Hong Kong and my eyeballs.

263
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,030
I could and just see the
city and I'm walking around.

264
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,720
And when I got back to my hotel
room at the end of the day,

265
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,410
they had put a goldfish in a little
goldfish bowl on my desk and it had a note

266
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,513
and it said,

267
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,260
traveling is sacred,

268
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,960
but no one deserves to be alone.

269
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,950
That's why we've provided the goldfish.

270
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:35,270
That's awesome to be your friend and
keep you company during your stay here.

271
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,133
Thank you.

272
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,390
So two nights later,

273
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,990
Fatboy slim is doing a concert on
the Calhoun side of the harbor.

274
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:43,220
I love Fatboy slim.

275
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,300
I'd never seen him.

276
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,170
I had a,

277
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:45,710
you know,

278
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,510
somehow,

279
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,343
uh,

280
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,970
got some ecstasy or whatever it was.

281
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,220
And uh,

282
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,050
it,

283
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:52,220
it,

284
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,730
it was,

285
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,140
it was such a great night.

286
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,910
These Chinese people were just
so stylish and fashionable.

287
00:06:57,911 --> 00:06:58,120
It was,

288
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,380
I had fallen out of fashion magazines.

289
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:04,430
I just had such a great time
dancing in the middle and a fat boy,

290
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:05,870
slim was just electrifying.

291
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,390
That night I drank tons and I got really,

292
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:09,771
really drunk,

293
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:10,390
you know,

294
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,300
life of a cow.

295
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,503
Uh,

296
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,790
that night when I'm sleeping
back in my hotel room,

297
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,890
I shit the bed.

298
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,250
I'm like a half awake,

299
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,681
you know,

300
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:24,140
that kind of a wet or drunk sleep.

301
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,460
And I thought it was a Fart,

302
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:25,731
you know?

303
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:26,170
And I look,

304
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,530
I blow it out and it's like a
wet ass p goes all over the bed.

305
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,210
And I had never had,

306
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:33,320
never should have been before.

307
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,750
I'd never should have better
my welcome to the team.

308
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,650
Absolutely say I was absolutely
ashamed that it happened.

309
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,580
I felt terrible.

310
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,240
So the next day I went and
I walked all over the city,

311
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,170
you know,

312
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:45,440
uh,

313
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,820
when I came back to my hotel room,

314
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,730
they had taken my goldfish away.

315
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,580
You need to go above and rolling
deserves to be alone except for you.

316
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:56,250
You've been shitting.

317
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:56,630
You agree?

318
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,463
Bad,

319
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,993
bad shit.

320
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,153
X Freak.

321
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,190
That's the problem with ecstasy.

322
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,440
Sexy until you ship.

323
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,760
Such as the lovely thing.

324
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:06,410
They put a little goldfish in my room.

325
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:06,921
That's nice,

326
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:07,730
man.

327
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,563
Beautiful.

328
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:17,990
Yeah.
