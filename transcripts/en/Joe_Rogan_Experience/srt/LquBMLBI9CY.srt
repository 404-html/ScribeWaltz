1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,410
Bom,
bom five four three two,

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,700
one.
We're live here from the valley with the

3
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:11,550
artist formerly known as the amazing 
atheist.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,370
Hello.
If I just started talking like that,

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,650
no explanation.
I just kept it going for years.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,690
Everything.
Like one day he's going to drop it.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,570
I um,
I kind of dropped it a little.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,950
The amazing atheist,
right?

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,330
Yeah.
I mean I still,

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,680
I still use it.
I oscillate.

11
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:28,620
I'm kind of trying to transition to just
using my real name.

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,483
Well,
the last time you were here you talked 

13
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:33,390
about that and that was I think two 
years ago.

14
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:37,320
So this was a low,
it was a year and three months ago.

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,010
Oh,
that's it.

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,850
Yeah.
Really?

17
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,140
Yeah.
Wow.

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,710
It was January of 2016.
Why do I feel like it was so my memory,

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,450
I don't know.
You know what,

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,600
that Dunbar's number thing where you can
only fit so many people in your brain.

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,220
Yeah.
And there's a,

22
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,520
there's definitely that going on in my 
head and then too much data.

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,930
My hard drive is fucked.
You know,

24
00:00:58,931 --> 00:00:59,764
have to get an old laptop and he keeps 
telling you you'd have to delete some 

25
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:04,260
files because you're running out of 
space.

26
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:06,990
And that's my brain.
Yeah.

27
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,853
I mean my brain is even worse because 
literally things like things I knew 

28
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:14,760
yesterday,
I don't know today anymore.

29
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,460
Yeah.
Like my memory is dog shit.

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,620
And you were just saying you haven't 
smoked pot days.

31
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,790
Yup.
Hmm.

32
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,590
Not In days.
Interesting.

33
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,070
Days and days,
days and days and days I fucked up with,

34
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:27,904
had an edible last night I did this a,
this is a show that my friend Jeremiah 

35
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,063
Watkins House and it's um,
like a make 'em up show or they call it 

36
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:36,540
stand up on the spot where the audience 
would yell out,

37
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,550
you know,
uh,

38
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,150
Fried Broccoli,
like whatever.

39
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,440
And you just have to rant on Broccoli,
like what,

40
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,740
what your thoughts are,
try to get some comedy out of it.

41
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:46,560
And occasionally maybe one out of 10 
subjects,

42
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,280
it will actually yield a real bit.
That'll come become a bit in your act.

43
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:52,860
It's really kind of amazing because when
you put on the pressure like that,

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,650
so I said,
what a good time to test the deep end of

45
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:58,980
the pool and uh,
find out what these a speed we'd edibles

46
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:00,470
are all about.
Oh,

47
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,540
I fucked up.
Yeah.

48
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,371
Fucked up.
My,

49
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:06,204
uh,
my brother had a like a panic attack on 

50
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:13,800
a edibles just like a few days ago.
Uh,

51
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,060
my friend brought over some like pot 
brownies and um,

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,260
he had one,
he's not really used to edibles.

53
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,330
Anyway,
I go to bed,

54
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,150
I'm laying down and watching like star 
Trek,

55
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:30,630
deep space nine or some shit.
I got a knock on the door like,

56
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,940
Tj,
Hey Max,

57
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,220
you come out here for a minute.
I'm like,

58
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,040
okay,
what the hell is this?

59
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,473
I got there.
It's like,

60
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,420
I feel like a man had a heart attack 
dude.

61
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,980
I'm like,
dude,

62
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:49,530
you probably just having a panic attack 
from too much weed.

63
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,060
Okay.
Has this ever happened to you?

64
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:54,900
Is this we're having to you?
I'm like,

65
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,240
yeah,
it's happened to me before.

66
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,040
Just calm down.
I know your heart's,

67
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,130
you feel disoriented and shit.
And,

68
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:05,890
uh,
I thought it was calming him down.

69
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,230
I've spent like 30 minutes talking him 
down,

70
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:08,891
but fine.
You know,

71
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:10,360
and he seemed like he was like,
okay,

72
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:11,230
yeah,
yeah,

73
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm cool now.
I'm cool now.

74
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,650
And then just all the sudden like,
no,

75
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,970
I feel terrible.
We gotta go to the hospital.

76
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,870
I got to go the hospital,
I got to go to the fucking hospital.

77
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,200
And um,
I drove him over there and uh,

78
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,333
I,
I sat down in that fucking hospital 

79
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,384
waiting room and they,
there was like this fucking ad for 

80
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,500
Stanley steamer and there was this 
terrible jingle and I'm like,

81
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,500
it's like the worst jingle I've ever 
heard.

82
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,120
It's not going to get stuck in my head.

83
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,930
And now to this day,
call one 800 steam Stanley steamer years

84
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,394
certified cleaner,
I'll be in bed at night and that should 

85
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:53,560
all be in my head.
Just over and over and over and over and

86
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:54,394
over again.
They have wizards would come up with 

87
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,134
those things,
man.

88
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,180
Even the ones that suck,
they just get in there,

89
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,961
you know?
Oh yeah,

90
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:01,120
it's a terrible one.
And he gets out.

91
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,930
They gave him some fucking,
um,

92
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,720
Adavan,
you know,

93
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,570
you can give them next time.
Just give him some coffee.

94
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,050
Coffee is like one of the best things.
Really.

95
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,063
Yeah.
There's something about caffeine 

96
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:14,590
apparently that counteracts the effects 
of marijuana when you're a really high,

97
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,230
they said just drink some coffee.
I'll have to do that next time.

98
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,490
Yeah.
If that happens.

99
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,950
Isn't that true?
That is true.

100
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:21,370
Right?
At an a hot shower.

101
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,893
That's right.
Everyone's got their own fucking home 

102
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:25,210
remedy for this shit I guess.

103
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,480
But here's the thing,
once you've done it a few times,

104
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,470
you realize,
well what the panic attack is,

105
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,304
is essentially your brain taking an 
audit of all the things that are real 

106
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,460
and a real worries that you haven't been
considering at home.

107
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,430
And then they fly,
well,

108
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,310
you're going to die someday.
Are you prepared?

109
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,020
Like what if it's tomorrow?
Are you ready?

110
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,760
Have you had a good life?
Oh,

111
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,193
what if someone close to you dies?
You think you're gonna be able to 

112
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:49,340
recover.
Ah,

113
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,510
you just start thinking like really 
crazy shit.

114
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,510
And it just makes you aware of those 
things.

115
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,030
And then once it wears off,
you know,

116
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,450
you reach that sort of a neutral point 
again.

117
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,660
Well he's a hypochondriac to begin with 
so that's not good.

118
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,640
You can't keep guys like that weed.
You should know better.

119
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,080
Well he's fine if he smokes it,
but if he eats it it's different things,

120
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,040
different,
different shit.

121
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,620
Totally different thing.
So um,

122
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,840
your podcast,
yeah.

123
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,200
Was the big podcast that kind of Sunk 
Milo.

124
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,870
It's kind of a combination of Mama need 
yours.

125
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,000
And I remember it was years,
it was me watching him on your show that

126
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:28,834
led us to ask about that cause I saw him
on your show and he was like God at the 

127
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:33,874
time.
Cause I remember at the time he was on 

128
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:37,500
our show,
uh,

129
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,240
I told Paul,
one of my cohosts like Paul,

130
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,500
this guy ain't no lightweight and he's 
got a huge army of sycophants right now.

131
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,490
If you get into debate with him,
if you lose,

132
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,040
you're a total bitch.
If you tie,

133
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,710
you lose.
If you win by a little,

134
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,573
you lose.
The only way you can actually beat him 

135
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:59,960
with his army of sycophants at this time
is if you just demolish him.

136
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,010
So don't even try.

137
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,263
You were concerned about this,
like this is like something you planned 

138
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:05,240
out in advance.
No,

139
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,310
I mean I wasn't really,
it wasn't really a plan.

140
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,220
I just wanted to bring it up cause I saw
him on your show sane and I'm like,

141
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,300
that's very strange.
I kind of knew where he was coming from.

142
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,373
Sure.
Cause I knew that he had had 

143
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:17,384
experiences,
like sexual experiences when he was 

144
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:22,490
younger and he was kind of,
I think he was trying to trivialize them

145
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,990
and turn them into humor.
Yeah.

146
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,040
I mean,
you know,

147
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,520
I mean his way of dealing with it or 
whatever,

148
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,290
um,
you know,

149
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,530
say I owe me and it was mutual between 
me and the priest.

150
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,960
I was molested by a priest,
but I was in new it,

151
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,010
so it was cool.
He was like,

152
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:38,460
I was the predator.
Yeah.

153
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,800
Like,
like he said,

154
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:41,260
Deuce the priest,
you know?

155
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,340
Yeah.
Uh,

156
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,800
it's kind of hard for me to imagine a 13
year old boy,

157
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,040
no matter how flamboyantly gay or 
sexually aggressive,

158
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,440
uh,
you know,

159
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:55,340
jumping the priest bones or something,
you know.

160
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,450
Well,
I think it,

161
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,283
it sort of gives you a better 
understanding of how this guy came to 

162
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:05,120
be,
who he is today and why he's so relishes

163
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:08,570
this role of being the contrarian and 
being this,

164
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:09,404
uh,
this sort of very difficult to 

165
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:16,361
pigeonhole gay man who's very 
conservative but yet believes in man.

166
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,680
Boy Love.
This is a,

167
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,233
if you go back and you read old articles
that he wrote for publications that he 

168
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,200
worked for in the past,
um,

169
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,880
there was a lot of stuff like we're 
going to take on bullying on twitter and

170
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,950
you know,
we need to make a safe space for people.

171
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:34,940
Um,
online.

172
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,280
This is Milo and now,
yeah,

173
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,740
he's like the biggest troll.

174
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,600
Right?
Uh,

175
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,170
I mean we talked about my low last time.
Uh,

176
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,320
I was on your show and you told me you 
kind of put the seed in my brain,

177
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:52,940
like [inaudible] kind of like fake.
And the more I've looked into it,

178
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:53,774
the more I have to question whether or 
not that shit with the priest even 

179
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:57,500
happened to begin with.
Yeah.

180
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,640
Cause I just don't,
I don't know.

181
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,503
I don't really trust the shit that comes
out of his mouth in terms of like face 

182
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:03,430
value.
Right.

183
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,470
And I think a lot of times when Milo 
tries to make a point,

184
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,293
um,
he doesn't necessarily make it by 

185
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:13,590
directly saying it.
He tries to make it through uh,

186
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,510
like performance art.
Like when he went on Bill Maher and,

187
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:19,910
um,
and you know,

188
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,883
he's,
he's doing this whole flamboyant gay 

189
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,294
conservative thing because he wants the,
the Liberal Bill Maher audience to be 

190
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:28,310
like boom,
boom.

191
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,020
Cause it's like,
oh look what hypocrites.

192
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,960
They say they accept gays,
but the second you don't tow their line,

193
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,750
what they obviously like is people who 
told their line,

194
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,090
not gay people.
Uh,

195
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,410
I think that was the point he was trying
to make.

196
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,220
I thought it was funny too,
how Bill Maher the next day after,

197
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,193
um,
Milo scandal broke was like I took him 

198
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:48,770
down.
It was me.

199
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:49,590
It was his hand.
Yeah.

200
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,200
It's like I took,
I took them down.

201
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:51,591
It's like,
dude,

202
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:52,424
you compare it.
You said he was the next hitchens when 

203
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:54,680
he was on your shit.
Wait a minute.

204
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,050
He really said he tells him down and 
said,

205
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,780
I took him down.
No,

206
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,790
choke him down.
Oh,

207
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,520
he's a fool.
That's such a foolish thing to think.

208
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,181
I don't,
I,

209
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:07,320
you know what I think is what Milo does,
a lot of it is performance art.

210
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,200
Yeah.
It's a lot of trolling and it's a lot of

211
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:11,034
very calculated stuff designed to sort 
of rile people up and get people active 

212
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:16,284
and get people to talk about him.
I mean that's the reason why he does 

213
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:21,010
this tour on colleges.
I mean,

214
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,883
why wilds?
Why not do it in the lion's den if you 

215
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:27,630
want to get the roars?
I mean he's doing it like where he feels

216
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:29,430
like this problem is the greatest.
Oh,

217
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:30,264
he wants to stir that pot too because he
knows if he just does it in some club 

218
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,910
downtown.
Yeah.

219
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,803
And it's,
there's not going to be any protest and 

220
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:36,144
was going to give a shit.

221
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,530
It's still protest,
I'm sure.

222
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:38,364
But not like bringing it to their camp.
They won't be like what happened at 

223
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,670
Berkeley?
Yes.

224
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,780
Yeah.
What happened at Berkeley?

225
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:44,640
It was just fucking insane.
It's really insane.

226
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:45,474
Is that,
was it the mayor of San Francisco that 

227
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,270
was applauding the protests like,
hey,

228
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:49,104
fuck face.
There was $100,000 worth of property 

229
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,590
damage.
People throwing chairs through starbucks

230
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:55,060
windows and light and cop cars on fire.
If this,

231
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,023
this ain't good.
There's been articles on like the 

232
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,330
Huffington,
I almost made a video about this article

233
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:02,640
on the Huffington post actually,
that was basically like,

234
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,100
um,
violence is as valid a reaction to trump

235
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:10,140
as anything.
And it's like,

236
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,303
wow,
you're literally just advocating for 

237
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,880
violence.
Uh,

238
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,430
and you think you're so enlightened.
Yeah.

239
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,440
It's completely foolish.
It's like,

240
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,210
it goes in once.
Things aren't going their way.

241
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,010
It goes against everything they've stood
before.

242
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,690
Before.
What about kindness?

243
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,450
What about compassion?
What about treating people with love?

244
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:28,590
What about facts?
Well,

245
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:29,880
that's okay.
When they're in power.

246
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,620
Exactly.
That's okay when they're in power,

247
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,370
but when someone else's in that they 
don't like it all kind of goes out.

248
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:36,730
They'll kind of goes both ways though 
it.

249
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,150
Oh yeah,
it definitely does mean,

250
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,680
remember when Obama was in office and 
there was people that were calling him a

251
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,540
Muslim and they were talking about 
taking them out.

252
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,460
I ain't fucking,
I remember,

253
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,780
uh,
I heard rednecks.

254
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:48,810
I was living in Louisiana at the time he
was elected and I heard redneck say shit

255
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:49,201
like,
man,

256
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:51,000
I can't wait for someone who was Sasha,
nate,

257
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:54,000
this piece of shit,
you know,

258
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,320
there's like,
they were looking forward to it.

259
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,680
Like not only did they think it was 
inevitable he'd be assassinated,

260
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,670
but it was like,
yeah,

261
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:00,660
that's going to be a good thing.

262
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,690
That's going to be a good day for 
America when Obama was finally killed.

263
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,530
And when they say things like that and 
you corner them,

264
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:05,941
you go,
okay,

265
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:07,740
well what,
what's so bad about them?

266
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,600
What Bob would drives you?
So nuts.

267
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,360
He's a Kenyan,
he's a Muslim and he says Shosha list.

268
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,470
Yes.
Socialists,

269
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:16,140
socialist months.
Muslim Kenyon,

270
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,230
communist,
a secret Muslim.

271
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,960
I would love it if someone pulled off 
socialism somewhere.

272
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,980
Like if there was one country can go,
well,

273
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:25,350
look,
those guys are happy.

274
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,813
I mean those folks,
if you look at socialism as like a 

275
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,054
gradient,
then there's plenty of countries that 

276
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:32,214
are,
that have like more or less they're 

277
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,194
socialists.
Pure socialism is a good idea anymore 

278
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,240
than like pure capitalism.
Like,

279
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,740
oh,
we just need laissez faire.

280
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,860
Liberty.
Like the the the libertarian idea.

281
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,143
Like yeah,
the markets will take care of 

282
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,304
everything.
How many libertarians is it take to 

283
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:49,770
screw in a light bulb?

284
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,990
None.
The free market will take care of it.

285
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,490
Yeah,
well those people get a little goofy and

286
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:55,324
you know,
the the most frustrating to me is the 

287
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:58,120
anarchists.
The ones who walk on,

288
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,860
no taxes.
No,

289
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,530
no cops.
No.

290
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,300
Nobody fixes the roads and private 
police.

291
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,270
All those.
Even wars.

292
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,940
Yeah.
It's like private police.

293
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,920
Like how does that work?
You mean everyone,

294
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,090
if you're,
if you have money,

295
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:10,924
you just hire out your own justice.
I mean higher up thugs d does that 

296
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:19,960
really seem like they would be objective
and in pursuit of like a justice?

297
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:20,794
It seems like they would just be your 
armed thugs that are going to meet out 

298
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:25,420
whatever form of justice you think is 
appropriate.

299
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,950
Yeah,
well for sure.

300
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:28,810
If they're working for you,
that'd be an issue.

301
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,930
If you're the big boss and the big boss 
wants these laws and forest,

302
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,033
you know,
and then the big boss passes zone laws 

303
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:36,490
on his property,
it makes things different.

304
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,090
It's like it gets real weird when you're
dealing with 350 million people.

305
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,250
That's really a part of the problem.
It's what,

306
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,123
what the style of civilization that 
works well for one person is not what's 

307
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:52,290
preferred by another person and all 
those things combined with the,

308
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,124
the whole an antiquated voting system,
the whole ridiculous electoral college 

309
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,510
system.
He just said,

310
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,000
we're never going to achieve some sort 
of peace of mind.

311
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:04,870
Super Delegates and Democratic Party.
Those are the most ridiculous.

312
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:05,471
Wait,
wait a minute.

313
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:09,130
Hold on you a super delicate so you can,
how does that work?

314
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:13,060
You can decide not to vote for the way 
the entire state voted.

315
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,200
Yes,
that's right.

316
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,153
Unbelievable.
And leaving it up to them to make sure 

317
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:18,700
that trump doesn't get a stop gap.
You know,

318
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:19,534
like because the,
the people in power have always been 

319
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:24,220
afraid of the actual will of the people.
So anything they can do,

320
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,600
they want to safeguard like,
well if the people choose poorly,

321
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,613
you know,
we want to be able to stop that from 

322
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:31,360
happening.

323
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,150
Yeah,
we have to those uninformed fools.

324
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:35,860
We can't leave them up to their own 
decision.

325
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,930
In all fairness,
I've been around America and there are a

326
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:40,060
lot of uninformed fools.
There's a few,

327
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,373
quite a few.
What do you think you think it's like 

328
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:42,634
half of us are uninformed fools.
I wouldn't even want to throw out a 

329
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:46,744
number,
but there's just a lot of people that 

330
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:49,474
are stupid.
I mean it's hard to know because you 

331
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:51,544
know,
you really almost don't know what 

332
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,300
someone really thinks until you sit down
with them one by one,

333
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,700
you know,
one on one and have a conversation.

334
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,040
And even then,
well you don't keep a real job.

335
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:00,874
Right.
When was the last time you had a real 

336
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:02,260
job?
A job job.

337
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,000
I worked at,
I hop for two days.

338
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,820
About 10 years ago.
That's it.

339
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:10,654
More than 10 years ago.
And what have you been doing for the 

340
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:12,670
most part since then?

341
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,050
Youtube.
Yeah.

342
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:17,080
See if you can make it live and doing 
something else.

343
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,570
In this day and age you're,
you're,

344
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:21,730
you're removed from the grid.
And if you,

345
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:25,300
if your mood from the employer,
employee grid,

346
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,520
you get to see things in a different 
way.

347
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:30,490
You Go,
well this is all temporary and you know,

348
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:34,090
everyone's working towards some future 
that really never comes.

349
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,073
You're,
this is like the life that you're 

350
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:38,140
experiencing right now is life.
Yeah.

351
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,123
And most people are spending that time 
doing shit they don't want to do and it 

352
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:42,874
fills up all their time.
So then when it comes to government and 

353
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:48,640
it comes to like who's leading the 
country,

354
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:51,740
which directions the country going into,
how much time to be

355
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,843
actually spend paying attention to it 
and actually spend really considering 

356
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:56,481
it.
I mean,

357
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:57,314
I've had a,
I've been at people's houses where I'll 

358
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:01,100
try to bring up,
um,

359
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,440
Paul news or politics or something like 
that.

360
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,463
They get sick and people are just like,
we don't talk about that in this 

361
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:08,360
household.
Whoo.

362
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,920
It's like Wiley.
You don't want it.

363
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,580
I mean,
like,

364
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,170
even like,
not even necessarily politics,

365
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:13,160
but just news like,
yeah.

366
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:14,240
Did you hear about this thing that 
happened?

367
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,400
I don't like news.
It depresses me.

368
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,950
Is this a woman?
Is this also like a woman's voice?

369
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,510
Yeah,
that was the woman.

370
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:21,580
And this is a,
this is the,

371
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,390
it was a woman voice.
Not In my house.

372
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,710
Woman,
not in my house.

373
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,023
We don't,
we don't put up with that shit around 

374
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:27,554
here.
We have ways that we allow you to 

375
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:30,410
communicate inside these borders.

376
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,370
By the way,
I did lose my,

377
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:34,070
I hop job by dumping pancakes on 
somebody.

378
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,993
You did?
Yeah.

379
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,130
Who Was it?
This fat fuck.

380
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,880
You know what?
But I went into the job and,

381
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:41,810
uh,
and I was like,

382
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:42,640
all right,
look,

383
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,970
I,
I'm not good with people.

384
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,060
Don't put me anywhere near front of 
House.

385
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,460
I'm being the kitchen.
I'm going to do.

386
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,220
I was living in Alabama at the time.
I was like,

387
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,270
uh,
18 I had a 32 year old girlfriend.

388
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,250
Oh Shit.
So I was like,

389
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,150
you know,
you're mature.

390
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,200
Yeah.
And um,

391
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,820
and she's like,
you know,

392
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:04,400
I was laying around the house every day 
while she went and worked and eventually

393
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:05,600
she's like,
you need to get a job.

394
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,361
And I'm like,
all right,

395
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:09,380
reasonable.
I guess.

396
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,880
Hey,
you're banging a 32 year old.

397
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:12,170
It should have been psyched.
Yeah.

398
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:12,951
Oh,
well,

399
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,960
I was at first,
but then when she said,

400
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:15,890
get a job,
I was like,

401
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,510
yeah,
but I did.

402
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,501
I'm like,
all right,

403
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,570
I'm going to try to make this work.
So I went to,

404
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:21,560
I hop and they were like,
yeah,

405
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:22,940
you just work the back.
I'm like,

406
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:23,451
okay,
cool.

407
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:24,320
I'll work the back.
I'll just,

408
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,940
I'll do dishes.
I'll just turn my brain off and wash the

409
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:28,620
dishes and you know,
I'll,

410
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,950
I'll learn to do the grill or whatever 
the fuck else.

411
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,580
A second day I was there,
they're like,

412
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:35,414
we're short staffed.
We're gonna need you to just take care 

413
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:37,460
of a few tables.
I'm like,

414
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,620
it's not a good idea.
I'm not,

415
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,020
I'm not good with the public training.
We've had to do it.

416
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:44,000
When they say short stuff now sent you 
out there,

417
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,641
they're just like,
yeah.

418
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:45,740
And I mean they get,
they told me like,

419
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:46,251
yeah,
you just,

420
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,980
you know,
hang out down there orders.

421
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,671
Yeah.
Just go out,

422
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:50,504
write out,
you know,

423
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,010
we know you're not going to be great at 
it,

424
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,330
whatever,
but go do it.

425
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,890
We're short staff.
We need you.

426
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,853
Everyone else in the kitchen is more 
vital than you are because they've all 

427
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:00,710
been here a long time.
So,

428
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,410
uh,
I went out and I took,

429
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,670
I waited on unlike three or four tables 
and then there was this one fat fuck who

430
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,820
maybe like,
I mean it,

431
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,290
it had been awhile.
This bliss place was not well run.

432
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,100
The fact that they sent me out to 
fucking wait tables is evidence of that.

433
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,400
So it was like 15 minutes and he hadn't 
got his fucking,

434
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,180
uh,
pancakes and breakfast and shit.

435
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,630
And he's like,
where my pancakes?

436
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:27,261
I'm like,
Oh,

437
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:29,330
I'm,
I'll go check you better.

438
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,190
You better,
you better.

439
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,640
That just rang in my head,
you know,

440
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,650
like the same as that jingle.
You better,

441
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,090
you better,
you better,

442
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,983
you better.
It's like I don't recall you sign in my 

443
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:41,320
fucking paychecks.

444
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,473
Uh,
so I just went up to him with a pancake 

445
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:47,730
train.
I just dumped it in his lap and like,

446
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,710
there you go bitch.
Wow.

447
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,830
I walked out.
That's all it took was you been,

448
00:17:51,831 --> 00:17:53,130
you know what,
I fucking,

449
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,083
I was,
I was out there in the parking lot for 

450
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:58,020
about seven hours because I didn't have 
a cell phone.

451
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,420
Uh,
I didn't have a ride.

452
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,850
It wasn't seven hours and we're like 
four or five,

453
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,760
but I was just wandering around in a 
parking lot.

454
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,803
I couldn't even stay in the IHOC parking
lot cause I didn't want anyone from 

455
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:09,894
there to come in.
But I just wondered around the parking 

456
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:12,594
lot at the shopping center for four 
hours waiting for my girlfriend to show 

457
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:17,340
up when she finally did,
I was just like,

458
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,863
yeah,
I quit.

459
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,200
Didn't tell her the story.
Just told her I quit.

460
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,083
And uh,
we broke up shortly after that I would 

461
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:27,360
imagine that wouldn't work out.
It didn't work out well.

462
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:28,590
You were 18.
Yeah,

463
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,450
I was young,
so I was young and stupid.

464
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,520
You were young.
Now I'm a little stupid.

465
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,683
You were antisocial,
slightly forced into a situation that 

466
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:38,850
you didn't desire.
I'm extremely antisocial in general.

467
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:39,691
Are you?
Yeah,

468
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:40,524
still to this day.
But that's interesting because you do 

469
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:46,350
youtube videos and you talk and you talk
with people on a podcast,

470
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:48,000
which is pretty social.
Yeah.

471
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,280
I'm getting better at it,
but I'm,

472
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,360
you know,
I'm still,

473
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:53,370
I'm still not comfortable around 
strangers and shit.

474
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,863
Yeah.
You get uncomfortable when you do 

475
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:57,840
podcasts like this one.
Does this make you and go,

476
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,501
oh yeah.
You know,

477
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,820
like a lot of people,
um,

478
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,743
when,
when I guess they figured out I was 

479
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:03,900
coming on here again,
I read a threat on,

480
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,790
uh,
the,

481
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,643
the drunken peasants,
a subreddit where people were talking 

482
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:09,240
about,
yeah.

483
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,073
You know,
he's gonna be on Joe Rogan again and 

484
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,131
then,
you know,

485
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:11,761
people are like,
yeah,

486
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:12,594
I liked last time,
but I hope he's not so nervous this 

487
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,300
time.
Oh,

488
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,670
we can't say that because he's like,
I'm like,

489
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:18,850
Oh shit.
Well,

490
00:19:18,851 --> 00:19:20,430
I,
I was nervous last time,

491
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:21,264
like last time I did your show,
I came in here and I talked to you and 

492
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:27,204
then I left and I was like,
I have no idea what the content of the 

493
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:34,250
conversation I just had was when I got 
here.

494
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:35,084
I don't remember fucking word.
You were already baked out of your mind 

495
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:38,730
when I got here.
That's true too.

496
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,623
That was,
I don't remember much of what we talked 

497
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:41,700
about either,
but it was good.

498
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,200
That's why you're back.
Yeah.

499
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:43,531
I mean,
I,

500
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:44,550
I,
I enjoyed it.

501
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,200
I've never been able to watch it though.
Yeah.

502
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,980
I don't watch them.

503
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,120
I can't watch it at all.
I mean,

504
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:51,270
usually I will watch everything that I'm
in and just am in love with the sound of

505
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:53,490
my own voice and obsessive and you know,
all that shit.

506
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,703
But,
uh,

507
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,280
like this,
this shall,

508
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:58,114
I couldn't watch it just because I can't
stand like I can't watch my CNN 

509
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:03,270
appearance either.
What'd you do CNN about?

510
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,270
Uh,
I went on CNN because they were doing,

511
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,650
there was like a new poll out that 
showed that the faith was on the decline

512
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:12,240
in America.
So they had me on there,

513
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:14,340
but unfortunately I was supposed to be 
on 30 minutes,

514
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,380
but unfortunately that was the day that 
fucking,

515
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,900
uh,
ratzinger resigned.

516
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:23,520
Uh,
so that it got preempted for that shit.

517
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,620
But I was on for about four minutes and 
I,

518
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:26,454
I had like an argument with a William 
Lane Craig about statistics and you 

519
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,990
know,
William Lane Craig,

520
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,400
he's a Christian apologist piece of 
shit.

521
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,340
He's horrible.
He's just wretched.

522
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,640
You can watch him debate,
uh,

523
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,553
hitchins and I think now he never 
debated duck and speak and watch them 

524
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:46,470
debate hitchens.
Terrible stuff.

525
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,093
Yeah,

526
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,190
that sounds like not,
not so good.

527
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,880
Just the name William Lane Craig.
It's like settle down buddy here.

528
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,760
Yeah.
Why not just William Craig?

529
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:58,594
Why you got through that lane in there?
Unless you're married to someone whose 

530
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:02,620
last name is lane and that's always a 
disaster.

531
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,610
A hyphenated marriages.
That shit just seems like someone's like

532
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:08,380
the,
that is an oil wrestling match.

533
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,840
Someone's going to lose.
You guys are going to lose.

534
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,610
It's not going to work.
It's too much.

535
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:15,190
Too much struggle for power there.
That's true.

536
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,593
Hyphenated name plus.
What do you do if you have what I mean 

537
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:19,000
it?
Yeah.

538
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,660
Well what happens when it compounds,
you know like the kids are born.

539
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:25,180
Do they take the hyphenated name?
Exactly.

540
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,043
And then what if they meet and fall in 
love with someone else who has a 

541
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:28,924
hyphenated name?
Do they then have like four last names 

542
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,890
with 300 kids in it?

543
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,723
You know,
it's like so is it just compound over 

544
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:38,740
time like until eventually everyone has 
every single last name.

545
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:40,960
Just hyphenated.
That's true.

546
00:21:40,961 --> 00:21:44,890
If everybody was so greedy and wanted to
be special the way those assholes do,

547
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,970
we would all have hyphenated names.
Yeah,

548
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:50,260
it'd be a real problem.
Maybe just get rid of the fucking name,

549
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:52,960
change shit and just argue about what 
the kids are going to be named.

550
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:53,794
I don't want to,
how do you feel about people changing 

551
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:55,624
their names?
Like what if you just decided like I 

552
00:21:57,971 --> 00:22:00,370
want to change my whole name.
I'm based in last,

553
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,190
might want to become a new person.
My Dad changed his name.

554
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,241
Did he?
Yeah,

555
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,010
it did have a crazy last name.
Hard to pronounce.

556
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,160
No,
it wasn't that my grandfather,

557
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,500
look,
I'm Thomas James Kirk the third,

558
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,050
but I'm the first person in my family to
have that name.

559
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,840
So what?
Yeah,

560
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,470
what happened was my grandfather was 
named James Vardaman,

561
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:25,471
Kirk James Kirk.
So when my dad was James Vardaman,

562
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:31,441
Kurt junior star trek came out at some 
point and he's James Kirk.

563
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,510
So he's getting star trek jokes nonstop 
all the time.

564
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,490
Finally he was in France and uh,
he ordered up some champagne.

565
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:43,324
It was Rome.
He's impressing a young woman and 

566
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,710
they're like,
oh it,

567
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,330
we'll beam,
it's right up sir.

568
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,650
And he's like,
fuck this name.

569
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:55,300
I got to get rid of this.
So when I was born,

570
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,200
uh,
Thomas James Kirk the third,

571
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,580
because he knew he was changing his name
to Thomas James Kirk Junior,

572
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:06,250
but he didn't actually officially change
it till after I was born.

573
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,940
So even though I'm the third,
I'm actually the first.

574
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,040
Whoa.
That's crazy.

575
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,200
No one would ever guess that an 
attribute test.

576
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,750
Nope.
He would sneak that one right through.

577
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,873
That's annoying.
That's like there's no one probably 

578
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:22,990
today that's named Rick James.

579
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,780
Like anyone born after the Chappelle 
show,

580
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,650
there's no fucking way anyone who saw 
the Chappelle show was named their kid,

581
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:31,150
Rick James.
If you're,

582
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,030
if your last name's James,
you're not going to name your boy rick.

583
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,830
Right.
I mean,

584
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,570
I don't know.
Maybe some people are like,

585
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:40,360
damn right,
Rick James Bitch James Bitch.

586
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,510
That was a real problem with Chappelle's
career.

587
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,580
Um,
that Rick James Bitch thing.

588
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:49,640
People yell it out at shows.
Just constantly yell it out.

589
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,970
Like White Bros,
like,

590
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:53,900
you know the,
you know,

591
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:55,190
the,
you know,

592
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:57,110
the guy who would yell at,
you could see him,

593
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,000
you know,
I'm Rick James Bitch.

594
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:03,320
Like drunk Rick James Bitch.
Woo.

595
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,180
Yeah.
And he'd just,

596
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,193
people apparently just kept doing that.
It shows it was like a real problem for 

597
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,530
awhile.
You should've done like,

598
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,364
uh,
just be like Schwartzenegger just 

599
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:12,530
embrace it.
Yeah.

600
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,640
Schwartz in here,
it goes around.

601
00:24:13,641 --> 00:24:16,820
He always is using all,
you were terminated and all this shit.

602
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,653
You know,
he just embraces it because he knows 

603
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:21,500
people just fucking get that shit in 
their head and they want to hear it.

604
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,310
So he's like,
fuck it.

605
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,300
Give it to him.
Yeah,

606
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:24,740
he did it on the new apprentice.
Right?

607
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,140
Dominate.
Yeah.

608
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,630
I never saw it.
Did you see it?

609
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,643
No.
No I didn't.

610
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,960
I didn't even watch the old one.
But he'll fucking go around like he'll,

611
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:35,660
he'll do all of this little lines.
I'll be back and all this shit.

612
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,180
You know he doesn't care.
No,

613
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:39,740
he doesn't.
That's just a trademark.

614
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,200
That's his shit.
I got scared of it.

615
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,183
I love the fucking,
there was a rally where someone threw 

616
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:46,820
eggs at Arnold Schwartzenegger.
They threw eggs.

617
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:48,710
I don't know how they threw eggs and got
on his suit and he's like,

618
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:51,590
well that's what's great about America,
but they owe me some bacon.

619
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:51,950
You know?

620
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,910
It's like,
what?

621
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,190
You're so fucking smooth,
Arnold.

622
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,230
You should be president.
Threw eggs at them.

623
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,273
Yeah.
What kind people just looking for a 

624
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:02,660
reason to get mad.
I'm pissed because Arnold,

625
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,583
he's the problem in America.
Arnold fucking Schwartzenegger was he a 

626
00:25:06,411 --> 00:25:08,900
good governor now?
Was he a bad governor?

627
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,793
No,
not really.

628
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,270
It was just half assed,
half assed,

629
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,170
mediocre.
Governor,

630
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,213
do you think it's almost impossible to 
jump in later in life without going 

631
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:21,180
through the river of politics first?
Well,

632
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,060
house of cards style,
I'm just kind of done it.

633
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,620
You're right.
But housing,

634
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,840
I mean he's in,
but I mean is it going to work?

635
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,420
You know what I mean?
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger got into like

636
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:31,730
in the relationship to the same,
you know,

637
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,500
the same sort of situation.
I mean,

638
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:34,490
does it really,
I mean,

639
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,340
it works enough to where he's president.
It's true.

640
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,330
I mean,
yeah,

641
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:39,290
it worked that well.

642
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,553
I mean,
his approval ratings are kind of dog 

643
00:25:41,991 --> 00:25:44,480
shit,
but they always were.

644
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,620
But like when you say whether or not 
Arnold Schwarzenegger was a good,

645
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,520
good governor,
I don't know.

646
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,383
I don't really know enough about it.
I would have to like really look into 

647
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:52,851
it.
But yeah,

648
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:53,684
I mean,
uh,

649
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,370
the,
the big thing was that,

650
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:56,330
uh,
he,

651
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,420
he tried to pass all these,
um,

652
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,103
um,
I guess the laws is not really the word 

653
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:05,030
I'm looking for,
but I'll use that.

654
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,660
He tried to pass all these like laws and
uh,

655
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,503
they all failed at the ballot and um,
people said he was done and he would 

656
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:13,034
just went out and like he went out and 
made a speech that almost gave you the 

657
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,230
impression like he'd been against them 
from the start.

658
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,990
Like yes,
these terrible laws,

659
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:22,790
they are gone.
It's like,

660
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,010
okay,
you're the one who pushed them,

661
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,993
but whatever.

662
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,100
He was really smooth that just,
uh,

663
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,370
operating with crowds and just knew what
to say,

664
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,960
new,
the right attitude to strike.

665
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,930
But in terms of actually governing,
it was just mediocre.

666
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,880
He didn't really get much done 
legislatively,

667
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,580
but he didn't really,
he wasn't really a disaster either.

668
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,430
Yeah.
Well that's what I was thinking like,

669
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:45,000
oh,
wonder how difficult it is to get things

670
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:45,834
done.
Like we'd only be guessing like sitting 

671
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:49,830
here on the outside and that guy that 
you were talking to,

672
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:52,410
like Obama was a piece of shit like that
kind of a guy.

673
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,970
Yeah.
Like how much of it,

674
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,310
how much of it do you think he really 
grasps?

675
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,780
Very little.
Yeah.

676
00:26:57,781 --> 00:27:02,781
I don't think anybody who's not doing it
grasps how complex that system,

677
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,863
you know,
you and I probably both know that the 

678
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,520
more people you involve in any sort of 
endeavor or project,

679
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:09,803
the more difficult it becomes because 
you're managing all these different 

680
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:13,770
interests for sure.

681
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,070
So when you're,
you know,

682
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,000
president or governor or something like 
that,

683
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:21,720
you have so many people that you're 
supposed to be representing and they all

684
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:24,480
have different ideas and there they all 
have their own,

685
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,310
uh,
there's other legislators who have their

686
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,160
agendas and shit.
So it's probably pretty difficult to get

687
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:29,994
much of anything done.
Could you imagine the stress of that 

688
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:33,780
job?
I mean,

689
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:36,870
just a mansion.
That's why,

690
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:37,704
uh,
trump's been golfing so many times just 

691
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,470
to try to relieve stress.
Yeah,

692
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,523
yeah,
sure.

693
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,040
I mean like he,
he criticized Obama for golfing too much

694
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,200
and now trump's like a big avid golfer.

695
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,170
I can't even imagine it.
I mean,

696
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,190
the guy's 70 years old to like,
why would even want to take this on with

697
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,370
all that money and all that,
you know,

698
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,380
all that power already.
Like,

699
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:03,840
why would he,
why would he want to be the president?

700
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,130
It just seems like such a fucking 
helacious job.

701
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,293
Unless he really feels like he can fix 
things or he's really gonna make a ton 

702
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:15,030
of money from it.
I mean this is a guy who plasters is his

703
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:17,280
fucking name on,
on hildings and shit,

704
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,900
you know.
So I think it's really just a matter for

705
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:21,750
him of like,
this is part of my legacy.

706
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,573
You know,
towards the end of my life I was 

707
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:26,970
president of the United States.
It's so weird.

708
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,800
It's so weird cause it's,
it's another version of what many people

709
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:36,801
did with Obama in this weird way in that
when Obama got into office,

710
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:38,124
there was all these like really,
really irrational people that said all 

711
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:42,180
kinds of crazy shit.

712
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,190
And by the way,
trump was amongst them.

713
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:45,450
He was a birther.
Yeah,

714
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:48,960
he was a member for the longest time.
He was convinced.

715
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,210
Somebody convinced him.
I Dunno who convinced him.

716
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,073
I Dunno if you've really relinquished it
and realize that it was wrong or if he 

717
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:58,530
still holds on to the idea.
Did he ever really believe it too?

718
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,920
I don't know.
You know,

719
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,863
I don't know.
But you know who started that whole 

720
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:03,990
birther thing?
Hillary Clinton.

721
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,890
Yeah,
she did.

722
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,990
That's right.
That's something that people forget.

723
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,000
It was during the,
uh,

724
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:08,834
the campaign between her and a Obama 
when they were trying to get the 

725
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:14,700
nomination in 2008.
Yeah,

726
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,271
yeah.
She,

727
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:16,104
she had,
well she had one of her little org send 

728
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:19,134
out materials that you know,
showed Obama and like the like he was 

729
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:25,530
wearing like some African Muslim garb 
shit.

730
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,070
Cause he went on a visit to some other 
co.

731
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,380
You look at him,
you know,

732
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,450
he's Muslim and uh,
you know,

733
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,660
and trump just ran with that.
Yeah.

734
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,890
Or a lot of Republicans did to cause 
it's,

735
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:38,724
you know,
well I guess that's just how they play 

736
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,060
politics.
They have some like that,

737
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:47,680
they just run with it.
It's just so strange to see when you got

738
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:51,040
to Canada named Barack Obama,
I know it's easy.

739
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,140
Hussein,
Hussein Obama,

740
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:56,420
like Barack Hussein Obama Sane in that 
to guide it,

741
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,210
you know,
ran a rack and Obama,

742
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,133
it had the similar to the name of the 
guy that crashed those planes into the 

743
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:03,520
towers.
And yeah,

744
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:06,310
somebody had a joe really good,
well wrote a joke.

745
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,293
I don't remember who it was though.
It might have been Tony Hinchcliffe but 

746
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,740
the,
I mean it's just,

747
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,430
this is almost a s a similar reaction.
I don't mean it's less,

748
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,780
it's more rational or less rational.
What I mean is almost like the energy of

749
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:20,614
the reaction,
like the energy of the birthers and the 

750
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:23,944
guys who were convinced that he was some
sort of undercover Muslim and then he 

751
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:27,664
was going to get into the White House 
and try to take America down from the 

752
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:29,710
inside.

753
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,543
Like that feeling,
that the amount of energy that way his 

754
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:36,010
mirror now on the left maybe even 
though,

755
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:37,570
yeah,
maybe even past,

756
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,160
I would say probably I might not be 
right because I might not be remembering

757
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:42,994
it perfectly,
but I feel like the energy on the left 

758
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:49,420
of people getting mad at trump is more 
powerful or more,

759
00:30:49,421 --> 00:30:53,560
there's more to it than the energy that 
I saw from people on the right.

760
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,700
They wanted Obama out of office,
but it might just be my memory.

761
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,910
And you gotta remember too,
there's an age gap there.

762
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,380
Yeah.
Cause you know,

763
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,830
most of the people who were talking this
shit about Obama were,

764
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,260
were pretty old.
Right.

765
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,980
And a lot of the people now that are 
pissed or really young,

766
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:06,814
so they're more likely to take to the 
streets and smash things and hold up 

767
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:12,650
signs and,
you know,

768
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,920
act wild and shit and mace people.

769
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:15,983
Yeah.
You know,

770
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,900
when Bush took office though,
like when Bush,

771
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,100
uh,
was,

772
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:23,680
was being inaugurated,
I remember that he was driving down,

773
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,311
uh,
to the,

774
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:26,500
to the White House during the 
inauguration day.

775
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:27,700
And they were,
you know,

776
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:28,391
with,
with trump,

777
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:31,800
the protesters kinda came the next day.
But with,

778
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,643
when Bush was inaugurated,
the protesters were all there the day 

779
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:35,370
of.
And you know,

780
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,213
Bush couldn't even do the little 
traditional walk down the last few 

781
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:40,384
blocks of the,
the journey because there was so many 

782
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:42,784
protestors and people were just throwing
things at the fucking motorcade and 

783
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:49,720
shit.
So I mean like this is not unusual,

784
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,440
but that was towards the end.
Now that was the very beginning.

785
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,440
What am I,
which 1:00 AM I thinking of?

786
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:58,270
Wasn't there one towards the very end?

787
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,323
The W

788
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,720
I think we're thinking of different 
ones.

789
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,680
Okay.
I think I'm,

790
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:04,514
my memory's fucked up,
but I think there was one towards the 

791
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:11,741
end where they had planned on having him
walk down some long stretch and they had

792
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:14,360
to abandon it and get them into a car.
Is that the same stores?

793
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:14,920
Uh,
yeah.

794
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,120
Well I think that was both times.
I think it was the first,

795
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:18,770
but even during his first,
uh,

796
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,873
time,
like when he was just first being 

797
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:25,481
inaugurated president in 2000 so right 
after Clinton that inauguration was bad.

798
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,230
It was almost the same.
Yeah,

799
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:28,064
it was terrible.
It was almost the same as what you see 

800
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,053
now because people had had this Democrat
in power for eight years and they 

801
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,300
thought like,
yeah.

802
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,600
And they thought Gore is a shoe in 
because Clinton's popular,

803
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:40,220
just same

804
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,740
as like Hillary's a shoe in because 
Obama's popular.

805
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,300
Right.
But,

806
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,480
you know,
a Republican ended up taking,

807
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,780
uh,
taking it and,

808
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,013
and they just freaked out.
And it seems like that always just 

809
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:53,181
happens.
I mean,

810
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:54,014
like this kind of like backlash.
Like it always is kind of sold to us as 

811
00:32:58,341 --> 00:32:59,450
like,
this is new,

812
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,160
this is like,
Oh wow,

813
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:01,994
look at what's going on now.
Isn't this crazy what crazy times we 

814
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:04,910
live in?
But it's,

815
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,390
I look back at my memories of the past 
and it seems like this is pretty par for

816
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:09,980
the course.
I think you're right,

817
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,143
now that I'm thinking about it,
it's almost like we go through these 

818
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:13,910
like cycles.
Yeah.

819
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,820
And if a president gets past one cycle 
removed from his,

820
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,200
his tenure,
then people forgive them.

821
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,570
They forget and they changed their 
opinion.

822
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,680
Yeah.
Like Reagan,

823
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:28,970
like man,
when I was a kid,

824
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,740
Reagan was a pariah.

825
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:35,240
Like people were so upset about Reagan,
they were so upset.

826
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:38,450
And there was the contra versus 
Nicaragua,

827
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,284
a trial that was on television with 
Oliver North and we were finding out on 

828
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:45,134
tv like whether or not the government 
had sold arms and lied about it and 

829
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:52,880
weather.
And then,

830
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:53,521
you know,
the,

831
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:56,510
the whole Reagan thing with winning that
Reagan sold arms to Iran,

832
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,433
the great Jimmy Tangle,
hilarious standup comedian and Boston 

833
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,004
has this bit about it because they were,
that was when Reagan started claiming 

834
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:05,870
all timers or when he claimed memory 
issues,

835
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,550
which turned out to be true.
I mean,

836
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:09,680
you really did have memory issues and he
probably did it at a time,

837
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,200
but they asked him,
did you sell arms to Iraq?

838
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:13,821
He said,
I don't know.

839
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:15,590
And Timmy tangles,
like mister president,

840
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,850
if you ever sell arms to people who hate
us,

841
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,220
jot it down.

842
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,780
I was like,
make a note,

843
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:28,250
put it on the refrigerator today.
I sold Amz to people who hate me.

844
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,440
You have to hear him say,
I mean,

845
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:31,274
you know it.
You have to realize that like America's 

846
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,870
always has been a huge arms dealer.
I mean,

847
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:37,910
we're constantly selling weapons.
Oh yeah.

848
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,010
I mean like if he,
if he didn't remember why he did it,

849
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,650
it's probably because there were just so
many other transactions.

850
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,513
I don't think the president personally 
gets involved too much in that sort of 

851
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,330
stuff,
but probably not.

852
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,180
Country sells weapons all over the place
and we continue to do that.

853
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,610
Yeah.
My point was that like eight years later

854
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:55,660
he was the great Ronald Reagan.
Oh yeah.

855
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,240
Eight years later,
and eyes,

856
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,510
he goes through the Clinton 
administration.

857
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:00,344
Everybody's done with the Clinton 
getting his dick sucked and the White 

858
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,630
House and all that craziness.
And,

859
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,570
and then as soon as that's over,
people start reminiscing to Reagan.

860
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,050
It's really interesting.
It's really interesting how we do it.

861
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:17,120
And so now Bush went through this period
of being hated and he's out of office at

862
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:17,954
Obama,
goes through his period of being hated 

863
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:21,530
for eight years.
And now that,

864
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:26,330
and even more unreasonable Republicans 
in office people long to the Bush days.

865
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,193
Oh yeah.
Like you noticed they're trotting Bush 

866
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:30,080
out and doing interviews with him.
Like,

867
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,973
Hey,
remember this war criminal now he's 

868
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:33,380
okay.
He's,

869
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:38,010
he's an uncle Bush the bush here.
Uncle Bush go set you on his knee.

870
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,080
They um,
super imposed.

871
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:43,470
What does that protests during the Bush 
administration now figurations.

872
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,740
Yeah.
Yup.

873
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,570
Wow.
What does it say?

874
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,700
Fuck Bush.
Oh,

875
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:49,730
buck flush.
Flush.

876
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,680
There's a couple of years,
not my president of course.

877
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,080
Man,
of course.

878
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,430
So you know,
this is,

879
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,740
this is all so cyclic.
Yeah.

880
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:02,340
It just happens over and over again and 
people think it's new and you know,

881
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:03,300
for some,
I think,

882
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:07,530
I guess it's the country just has a 
short memory to what a crazy show.

883
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:08,364
This is.
What a crazy show we're watching the 

884
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:13,190
battle to control the world.
Yeah.

885
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,910
Political Theater,
pageantry.

886
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,370
But you know,
like it's just,

887
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:18,204
I mean like I don't want to get into 
like you already had Alex Jones on the 

888
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:23,640
show,
so I can't really get into that level of

889
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:27,150
territory.
But I mean I do agree that these parties

890
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:27,984
are constantly just working together 
behind the scenes and that 90% of the 

891
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:32,214
issues they agree on,
they just make a big spectacle of the 

892
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:39,450
little things they actually disagree on 
to distract us with a show.

893
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,300
You Look America,
look,

894
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,390
look at us,
we're fighting,

895
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:44,550
we're fighting.
Have they stopped paying attention?

896
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:45,640
Okay,
now we've met,

897
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,000
now we do the real deals.
Who are we going to bomb?

898
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,050
Who we going to invade?
You know,

899
00:36:50,051 --> 00:36:50,884
uh,
who were going to sell weapons to 

900
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,700
whatever.
Yeah.

901
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,550
It's probably definitely some of that.
I mean,

902
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:58,740
if they're all working together,
if you watch house of cards,

903
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,980
do you watch house of cards?
Uh,

904
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,893
I watched the first season,
but when he started pushing people in 

905
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:04,830
front of trains and shit,
I was like,

906
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,050
sh spoiler alert.
Sorry.

907
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,580
This is the beginning of season two.
I mean the vein,

908
00:37:09,581 --> 00:37:10,620
seeing that whatever.
Listen man,

909
00:37:10,621 --> 00:37:12,210
I'm only on season three.
Oh,

910
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,380
okay.
I just got into it.

911
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,870
I've been been binge watching Jeanette.
Look,

912
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:17,790
I really like Kevin Spacey's 
performance,

913
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,560
but it just got a little over the top 
for me,

914
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,180
you know.

915
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,660
All right buddy.
Well,

916
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,670
we all have different standards,
I guess.

917
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:24,570
Uh,
I'm sorry.

918
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,560
I'm sorry.
I don't,

919
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:27,780
I'm not insulting the show.
Isn't that a funny thing though?

920
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:31,170
Like if someone likes something and you 
don't like it,

921
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,590
it gets personal sometimes.
Yeah.

922
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,280
Like,
especially like music.

923
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,060
Oh,
music.

924
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,210
It's like you listen to that shit.
This is really shit you listen to.

925
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,470
Like,
people get mad.

926
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,620
I can get,
I can get mad.

927
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:45,450
Like if someone's like,
you know,

928
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,540
I really liked beyonce or something,
I'd be like,

929
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:49,710
you'd get mad.
What if you got in the car and someone's

930
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:52,430
playing like some like Electronica,
Eh,

931
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,350
Eh,
Eh,

932
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,100
Eh,
Eh,

933
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,933
Eh,
Eh,

934
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:55,870
Eh,
Eh,

935
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,570
Eh,
uh,

936
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,510
uh,
you know,

937
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:58,344
like a,
like a villain and some sort of a coen 

938
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:03,270
brothers movie,
like Belsky Villain.

939
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,153
Remember those guys?
You know,

940
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,003
I was a,
I was in an uber the other day where 

941
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:09,120
someone was playing like,
it sounded like fucking elevator music.

942
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,763
Like it was like he was just listening 
to the shit you hear in fucking 

943
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:16,890
elevators and it was like a 45 minute 
drive and I'm just like,

944
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,331
oh my God.
I mean,

945
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:20,580
I can't say anything.
It's his fucking car.

946
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,040
This is drive to be fucking up the wall.
Could you bring it up to me?

947
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,650
A lot of it bring it up.
I mean,

948
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,810
I,
I'm sure I'm allowed to,

949
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,530
I mean there,
there's,

950
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,750
there's nothing's going to happen if I,
if I bring it up,

951
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:31,584
but I just don't want it.
I don't want to have that discussion 

952
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:33,451
like,
Hey,

953
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:34,284
can you change your music because it's 
horrible to me and it's grading on my 

954
00:38:37,451 --> 00:38:41,700
last nerve right now you're supposed to,
you get control of that music and the,

955
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,790
with the APP,
you know,

956
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,933
like,
I didn't mean that we bad at dealing 

957
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:45,820
with people with the APP.

958
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,591
Yeah.
With Uber App.

959
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,424
There's a button it connects to your 
spotify said like they're supposed to 

960
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:49,744
offer the ox cord when you get in the 
car so you can control the music with 

961
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,310
double annoying for the driver I would 
imagine.

962
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:56,860
But yeah,
if they're supposed to give you control,

963
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,110
really?
Whoa.

964
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,970
See I've never,
I've never taken that right.

965
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,793
So you let them just,
I just let them do what they do over 

966
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,493
with the shitty music.
I mean cause I mean at the end of the 

967
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:08,763
day they're the ones who have to drive 
around in this fucking car all day and 

968
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:13,420
I'm just getting a ride.
So I feel like an asshole being like,

969
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,313
no,
I'm going to pose my musical tastes on 

970
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:19,150
you cause I feel like it's their car,
whatever there.

971
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,820
Well it's definitely their car.
It's also,

972
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:26,821
what's weird is why is music suck to us 
and it's great to some people.

973
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,060
Like what is that?
What is it about a song that you go,

974
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,870
oh that's a fucking great song.
And someone else would go turn that off.

975
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,240
I don't know.
It's like it,

976
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,530
it kind of reminds me of something with 
food.

977
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,010
Like people have different food 
preferences and shit and I was wondering

978
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:45,190
like,
I'm eating a pickle and you know,

979
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:47,170
I like it.
Other people hate pickles.

980
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,873
So when they eat a pickle,
does it taste different to them than it 

981
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:52,324
does to me?
Or is it the same taste but they just 

982
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:56,500
don't like that taste?
Yeah.

983
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,720
And I kind of wonder the same thing 
about the music thing.

984
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,820
Yeah,
I think for sure.

985
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,370
I think it's,
um,

986
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,933
I probably,
it's probably a visual thing too and 

987
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:06,064
not,
not visual in terms of like taking 

988
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:10,870
account of space and mass,
but visual and account of like what,

989
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,210
what each individual image does for you.

990
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,530
Like how it looks too.
Yeah.

991
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,020
I like the overall feeling it gives you,
I think it's different for everybody.

992
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:19,690
It just has to be,
it has to be,

993
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,780
I mean,
what would it,

994
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,990
what else would account for all the 
different tastes?

995
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,340
Yeah,
the obvious different,

996
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,640
especially music,
but then this like tastes that you very,

997
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:28,474
yourself,
like you ever catch yourself in some 

998
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:30,904
weird mix?
Like you hit ipod shuffle or something 

999
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:35,260
like that and you catch some weird mix 
of songs that you like and you're like,

1000
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:36,970
wow,
they just do not go together.

1001
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,700
Like these two are just really weird.
Back to back.

1002
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,950
Yeah.
You know,

1003
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,160
going,
going back to the food thing,

1004
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:42,551
like,
you know,

1005
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:46,060
there's certain foods you might like,
but maybe together they're not so great.

1006
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,080
Oh yeah,
for sure.

1007
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,063
And then certain foods you would think 
would not be good together but are 

1008
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:54,430
amazing like a pineapple and anchovies.
See,

1009
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,323
uh,
I don't,

1010
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,100
I don't like either of those by 
themselves.

1011
00:40:57,101 --> 00:41:00,970
So dude on pizza,
the high end apple anchovy pizza.

1012
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,983
Oh,
you're one of those pineapple on Pizza 

1013
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,220
People,
Huh?

1014
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,740
Very rarely.
Only with anchovies.

1015
00:41:05,741 --> 00:41:07,460
I'm not a Hawaiian pizza guy.
Yeah.

1016
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,693
Uh,
I don't even think Hawaiians are 

1017
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:10,710
Hawaiian pizza people.
Who's,

1018
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,980
who's getting that?
Hammond?

1019
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,130
I'm a,
I'm a big,

1020
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,070
if it's Canadian Bacon,
why is it a Hawaiian Pizza?

1021
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,720
That's a real good question,
man.

1022
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,583
That's a super good question.
Why is it and how the fuck is that 

1023
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:24,160
Bacon?
It's not,

1024
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,890
if you go to Canada and say,
I want some bacon.

1025
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:28,650
They don't bring you that shit.
Yeah,

1026
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,730
that's some,
yeah.

1027
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,600
What is that?
That's like a Belgium waffle.

1028
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,370
Why is it from Belgium?
This is a god there isn't a waffle.

1029
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,293
No,
the fucked up thing is I went to 

1030
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:37,064
Belgium,
then I got a waffle there and it's 

1031
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:41,810
nothing like what they fucking say it,
you know that we Belgian waffles here,

1032
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,300
they're like round and you put it on a 
plate with syrup.

1033
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,370
They give you like,
it's like street food there.

1034
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:49,430
You get like a little tiny fork and 
there's like a small waffle,

1035
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:50,390
it's not even round.

1036
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,210
And they put whatever the fuck you want.
It's not just syrup.

1037
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,044
They'll put like fresh strawberries and 
all kinds of shit on there and you just 

1038
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,750
sit there and eat it with this little 
tiny ridiculous fork.

1039
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,243
And it's totally different than what 
what's called a Belgian waffle in 

1040
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:05,300
America.
So it's like one of those,

1041
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:06,134
um,
you ever go to one of those crepe 

1042
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,390
stands?
Yeah,

1043
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,840
it's in the mall.
You know,

1044
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:10,683
like they make you a little crepes and 
waffles and stuff and they put new tell 

1045
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:13,604
autumn and the watch different.
I would say it's probably closer to 

1046
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:16,250
that.
Yeah.

1047
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,100
That's God damn delicious.
That's way better than a Belgium waffle.

1048
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:19,963
Fuck yeah.
But at Belgium [inaudible] was easy to 

1049
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:22,420
do,
you know,

1050
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,810
put it in that mold.
Yeah.

1051
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,720
Stamp that sucker down.
Paul.

1052
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:26,554
Dot.
Waffle Tj and Joe Rogan talk about 

1053
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:31,940
waffles.
It's important to talk about Waffles,

1054
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:34,640
waffle house,
one of the best road foods ever.

1055
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,500
And uh,
cause you can guarantee you're gonna get

1056
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:38,810
the same thing pretty much everywhere.
No one else,

1057
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,880
no one else can do hash browns that I 
like other than waffle house.

1058
00:42:41,881 --> 00:42:42,920
Sam,
good Hash browns.

1059
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,800
They're putting crack in his fucking 
Hash browns to the waffles.

1060
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,670
Ridiculous Dude.
And you see someone,

1061
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:51,800
you see so much crazy shit at waffle 
houses too.

1062
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,280
Like I was at a waffle house and uh,
the service was terrible.

1063
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,690
I was in there for like an hour and a 
half,

1064
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,553
but God damn the show was amazing 
because the cook and the one waitress 

1065
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,570
hated each other and we're fighting the 
entire time.

1066
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,930
And it got to the point where she,
she runs out,

1067
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,030
she's in the parking lot crying and he's
like,

1068
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:11,893
giving me free food,
don't report this and now you got free 

1069
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:15,680
food.
Oh Jesus.

1070
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:16,723
It's like,
all right,

1071
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,520
thanks.
Went to another waffle house.

1072
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:20,540
And I was like,
uh,

1073
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:21,890
not really a kid but like,
you know,

1074
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:25,340
a teenager,
the guy that ran that waffle house was a

1075
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:27,320
fucking psycho,
the cook,

1076
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:28,820
he would just yell at you.

1077
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,940
He came over to my table one time and 
he's like,

1078
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,090
this waitress is uh,
getting off soon.

1079
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,510
I think you guys need to go pay your 
bill and go,

1080
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,890
whoa.
I'm like,

1081
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,970
okay.
I mean this is open 24 hours.

1082
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:45,680
Right?
Like what?

1083
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,001
He's like,
no,

1084
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:47,834
close it out cause she's got to go,
I guess she wants the tip before she 

1085
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,790
leaves or whatever.
Um,

1086
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,373
so that was weird.
One time a drunk came in there holding 

1087
00:43:56,691 --> 00:44:00,520
the like a bottle of wine or something 
and he,

1088
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:02,900
and he was just like,
no,

1089
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,700
get that Outta here.
That's not allowed in here.

1090
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:06,350
Get Out.
Whoa.

1091
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,243
Just like very intense all the time.
I think it was like a retired cop or 

1092
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:13,310
something that was just didn't,
I don't know,

1093
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:16,040
didn't get his pension or some shit.
So he's at a waffle house,

1094
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:18,290
then his pension on the waffle house to 
make it big.

1095
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:19,910
I mean,
I don't think he wasn't the owner.

1096
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:21,590
He's just a fucking cook.
Oh,

1097
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:23,143
just a cook who's like cantankerous and 
angry and would yell at you and attack 

1098
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:28,040
you.
Weird food places,

1099
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:31,800
men like weird food places you traveling
and you for a brief period of time,

1100
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:32,090
enter

1101
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,770
into these people's worlds and watch 
them interact with iron skillet.

1102
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
I went to,
um,

1103
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,253
this Montana diner,
this really small diner outside of 

1104
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:42,450
billings,
Montana with a few of my friends.

1105
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,030
And uh,
we uh,

1106
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:45,864
we pulled into this diner and we had 
just got done hunting for five days in 

1107
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,171
the,
in the mountain.

1108
00:44:50,171 --> 00:44:52,750
So we're just,
we were dirty and it was,

1109
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:56,250
it was like we were tired.
We just been camping this whole time.

1110
00:44:56,251 --> 00:44:59,430
We just got off of a boat and this guy 
had a,

1111
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:04,470
like a big piece of cardboard,
like four by four,

1112
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,333
like four feet by four feet,
cardboard with photos of all these 

1113
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:13,101
different marines that he had propped up
on like an easel board and on it had all

1114
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:14,844
the different soldiers that had died 
under Obama's watch and this one 

1115
00:45:18,871 --> 00:45:21,270
particular mission.
And he kept pointed out like,

1116
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:22,104
these are,
these are 11 of our boys that died 

1117
00:45:24,411 --> 00:45:25,244
because of this president,
so-called president that was not my 

1118
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:29,140
price and it not my brethren,
you know,

1119
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,433
it got to that weird shit.
And he was coming over to the table and 

1120
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:35,400
talking to us while like,
while we were there eating.

1121
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,630
I'm never forget that guy.
It was just so bizarre.

1122
00:45:39,631 --> 00:45:40,590
Like he had to go.
Yep.

1123
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:41,970
It's terrible.
Yup.

1124
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,620
It was terrible.
Can we leave?

1125
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:47,310
Like we're stuck while this guy like 
hovered over us with his,

1126
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,460
his lecture is powerpoint presentation.
I mean,

1127
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:51,294
he had like photos of these guys up on 
this thing and he wanted to talk to 

1128
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:54,384
everybody about it.

1129
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,110
Yeah.
He,

1130
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,820
yeah.
I had a weird food experience in,

1131
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:59,130
uh,
Colorado because driving,

1132
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,083
I drove all the way from Columbus to 
Seattle when I was moving because we 

1133
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:05,080
had,
um,

1134
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,070
like dogs and lizards and all kinds of 
shit.

1135
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,960
So we just decided to drive it and,
uh,

1136
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,120
you know,
to make kind of a road trip of it.

1137
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:15,954
We stopped off in Colorado for like a 
couple days to check that out cause I'd 

1138
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:23,100
never been there.
We're at the hotel restaurant.

1139
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,253
The waiter we had was fucking like the 
most bipolar fucking dude in history 

1140
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,630
because we ordered this,
you know,

1141
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,670
uh,
fruit and meat,

1142
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,450
cheese tray or whatever,
meat and cheese and you know,

1143
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,390
some other shit and there's some nuts on
it.

1144
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,160
And,
um,

1145
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,880
somehow it comes up.
My girlfriend has like nut allergies.

1146
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,280
Oh No.
And you know,

1147
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,423
they're not severe.
They're really mild and she just avoids 

1148
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:56,250
it by not eating those nuts.

1149
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,930
You know,
if something touches them,

1150
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:59,370
they're fine.
But this guy,

1151
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:00,953
he's over there like,
why didn't you tell me she had a nut 

1152
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:04,920
allergy?
And we're just kind of like,

1153
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,170
ah,
this is not just not a joke.

1154
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,870
This is a serious matter.
Don't laugh.

1155
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:10,763
We take this very seriously here.
I'm not exaggerating this fucking guy 

1156
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:16,110
either.
Like this is like,

1157
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:19,080
he's like a costing us about this shit 
and he's like,

1158
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:20,310
I don't even know if I should bring that
out.

1159
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:21,720
I don't even know if I should bring that
out now.

1160
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,640
And we're like,
just,

1161
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:26,190
just bring it out.
She just won't eat the nuts.

1162
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,740
And you're just like,
she can not have anything from the tray.

1163
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,973
You understand?

1164
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,810
Oh,
nothing from the tray.

1165
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:32,770
Can She,
and were like,

1166
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,050
and he kept asking like,
is it airborne?

1167
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,410
Is the nut allergy airborne?
Some people have an airborne nut out.

1168
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:40,960
Sure.
But she doesn't,

1169
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:43,300
and she told him that and he's 
persistent and he wouldn't,

1170
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:45,910
he'd like ask it but not wait for the 
answer.

1171
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,240
And then he'd come back and he'd be 
totally pleasant.

1172
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,520
Like,
so you guys on the Dah,

1173
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:51,970
Dah,
Dah.

1174
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:56,440
And then he'd leave any,
come back again and he'd be crazy again.

1175
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,570
Like she,
she held up her glass.

1176
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,433
He's,
he's like refilling and her glass kind 

1177
00:48:00,581 --> 00:48:01,480
of far away.
So she like,

1178
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,710
you know,
holds it out.

1179
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:04,660
And he's like,
put that back on the table,

1180
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,870
put that back on the table.
It's like,

1181
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:08,710
what?
Whoa,

1182
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,753
you're a fucking psycho.
That whole city though was high strung 

1183
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,773
shit.
Cause I remember I went to a pot shop 

1184
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:17,920
there and the guy at the pot shop,
he was like,

1185
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,490
first of all you had,
I had to go to a waiting room,

1186
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,400
which is just weird and like take a 
number.

1187
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:25,263
And then I was called into another room 
when I thought it was gonna be able to 

1188
00:48:27,131 --> 00:48:27,964
buy weed,
but instead it was just another waiting 

1189
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:30,934
room.
And then I finally get to the fucking 

1190
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,353
little broom closet where they keep 
their meager supply a fucking weed and 

1191
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:42,820
there's this guy behind the counter and 
he know shit was like,

1192
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,580
what?
I'm like,

1193
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,480
okay,
please watch.

1194
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:52,530
And then we had four people with us.
He proceeds to do it to everybody.

1195
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,030
So four times in a row,

1196
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:57,050
Yay.

1197
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,330
I'm like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

1198
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:04,320
Like I smoke weed to like chill out and 
relax and shit,

1199
00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:05,290
but you're just like,
okay,

1200
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:06,750
okay.

1201
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:07,583
And he's,
he's bitching about how hard his job is 

1202
00:49:08,851 --> 00:49:09,361
there too.
It's like,

1203
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:10,194
man,
I can't wait till we get off works that 

1204
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:12,024
we could get really high.
I mean we're already high but we're 

1205
00:49:15,211 --> 00:49:16,044
going keep it real.
That guy gets a vote to and then there 

1206
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:20,610
was a,
when I was leaving that fucking place,

1207
00:49:20,611 --> 00:49:24,960
there was like a syringe like on the 
floor of the fucking weed shop.

1208
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,970
I'm like this fucking,
it was Colorado.

1209
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:29,910
We'd shit as a joke.
I think it's way better in Washington.

1210
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,870
You just go into a fucking store like 
any other store and buy it.

1211
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:34,883
Well,
I think what they're worried about more 

1212
00:49:35,401 --> 00:49:36,234
than anything is people robbing them.
Maybe that's probably why they make you 

1213
00:49:38,551 --> 00:49:41,460
go through steps.
Like step one and step two.

1214
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,560
Yeah,
phased introduction.

1215
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:44,573
Yeah.
I mean also they can isolate you from 

1216
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:48,660
the outside if you have,
if they have cameras,

1217
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:49,613
the cameras are monitoring you.
It's probably makes people less likely 

1218
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:55,410
to try to attempt an armed robbery.
Who knows?

1219
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:57,770
But you could arm robbed any fucking 
place I made.

1220
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,500
Sure.
No,

1221
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,870
it's not like it was exclusive to weed 
shop for sure.

1222
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,370
It's just a scary thing what they're 
doing where they're not allowing them to

1223
00:50:05,371 --> 00:50:06,204
use credit cards so that they have the 
keep large chunks cash around and I 

1224
00:50:10,021 --> 00:50:12,150
think they're trying to resolve that.
I don't know if they have yet,

1225
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,193
but it was a giant issue for a long time
because they would have to hire these 

1226
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:16,503
like,
uh,

1227
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,710
like mercenaries essentially.
Yeah.

1228
00:50:19,711 --> 00:50:21,440
You know,
guys who worked for like black water and

1229
00:50:21,441 --> 00:50:22,274
stuff like that to the,
those kind of guys to carry the money 

1230
00:50:24,681 --> 00:50:27,140
around or to guard the people that are 
carrying the money around.

1231
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:27,980
Did you hear

1232
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,980
a jeff sessions recently saying that 
marijuana is a dis,

1233
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:37,963
like it's,
it's just a destructive fucking drug 

1234
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,060
that is almost as bad as heroin?
Yeah.

1235
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,860
He said that to,
was it today or yesterday?

1236
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:48,120
I think it was either today or yesterday
that he said,

1237
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,093
I saw it.
It's hilarious that this guy is in 

1238
00:50:50,871 --> 00:50:53,900
charge of anything.
Only slightly less awful.

1239
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:56,270
Was his words only slightly less off of 
the heroin.

1240
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:00,860
Someone is without a doubt,
if that's what he's expressing,

1241
00:51:00,861 --> 00:51:02,660
someones without a doubt influencing 
that.

1242
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,990
Like there's,
there's more than just his opinion here.

1243
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,180
This is not these,
when these,

1244
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:09,014
they have these meetings when they're 
discussing policy or the discussing how 

1245
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:13,334
they proceed.
Like this isn't as simple as this one 

1246
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:18,500
wacky dude's opinion and they leave him 
alone with his opinion.

1247
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:20,180
He has ultimate power.
There's no way.

1248
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:22,250
There's a bunch of vested interests.

1249
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,083
There's a bunch of people that have 
tremendous amount of money at stake and 

1250
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:30,490
would lose money if marijuana was legal.
That is 100% why that guy was doing it.

1251
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,333
Sure.
But I mean,

1252
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,413
he's,
his personal opinion towards weed has 

1253
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:37,460
always been mean.
Like he was at lie like that.

1254
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,294
Like that's just a fucking lie.
You don't have any data to show that 

1255
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:44,930
that's even remotely true.
Heroin kills fuck loads of people.

1256
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:47,030
People,
their bodies are ravaged by it.

1257
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:50,630
Pot doesn't do a goddamn thing to you.
It might make you a little loony.

1258
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:51,800
Yeah.
Just,

1259
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,550
I mean like,
you know,

1260
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,230
it's not even comparable.
No.

1261
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:58,620
And if you might be schizophrenia exams 
where they looked at all the,

1262
00:51:58,621 --> 00:52:00,070
the population and they said,
you know,

1263
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,120
marijuana contributes to schizophrenia.
And they were like,

1264
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:02,361
well,
no,

1265
00:52:02,361 --> 00:52:04,430
actually no.
If you look at the number,

1266
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:08,150
it's always 1% and it feels 1% of 
smoking pot or not smoking pot.

1267
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:08,983
It's still,
the schizophrenia numbers have always 

1268
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:11,570
been around 1%.
Yeah.

1269
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:14,540
I mean like it can be exacerbated by 
marijuana,

1270
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,160
I'm sure.
But it's not,

1271
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,990
it doesn't cause it.
Yeah.

1272
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:18,990
I think,
I don't,

1273
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,230
I'm not a brain scientist,
nor are you,

1274
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,090
are you?
You're not.

1275
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:22,710
I had,
I've,

1276
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:24,080
I've dealt with schizophrenia.
People,

1277
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:24,941
you know them,
right?

1278
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:25,341
Yeah.
Yeah.

1279
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,990
I've known a few.
It's,

1280
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:27,824
um,
I think it probably varies like any 

1281
00:52:29,391 --> 00:52:30,224
other kind of mental illness.
But what pisses me off though more than 

1282
00:52:32,121 --> 00:52:32,954
even like the personal angle of like,
I'm a pot smoker and this affects me 

1283
00:52:36,261 --> 00:52:37,130
personally.
I mean,

1284
00:52:37,131 --> 00:52:37,964
that does get my goat a little bit,
but what really pisses me off is that 

1285
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:43,910
trump is mr jobs.
Yeah.

1286
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:44,803
This industry,
this $7 billion recreational marijuana 

1287
00:52:48,771 --> 00:52:50,990
industry is employing,
uh,

1288
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,880
like a hundred,
150 people.

1289
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:54,050
Yeah.
Uh,

1290
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:59,050
part time and full time that are along 
some rung of the ladder of like,

1291
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:00,650
oh,
well,

1292
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:01,483
you know,
either they're working for the growers 

1293
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:06,830
or they're doing the packaging are there
helping with the shipping.

1294
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:10,820
So this is like a huge job creator.
It's a huge money maker.

1295
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:14,390
This is what trump ran on.
Trump's like,

1296
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,253
I'm the jobs president.
I'm going to bring jobs back if they go 

1297
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:18,824
after this industry.
That's the exact opposite of bringing 

1298
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:23,430
jobs back that's shutting jobs down.
Yeah.

1299
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,100
What's shutting jobs down though?
With a

1300
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,130
kind of people that we don't really want
around the first place?

1301
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:30,643
I mean,
they can,

1302
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,273
they can sort of surmise that people 
that are running pot shops are probably 

1303
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:36,360
pretty left wing,
you know,

1304
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:37,740
pretty,
pretty quickly.

1305
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,660
Sure.
So you're making almost,

1306
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:41,340
you're making more money for your 
opposition,

1307
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:43,500
whereas the pharmaceutical companies,
they,

1308
00:53:43,501 --> 00:53:44,910
they,
they're nonpartisan.

1309
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,920
Don't forget the alcohol and just,
yeah,

1310
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,140
that's true.
Both of them.

1311
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,660
The prison unions,
prison guard unions.

1312
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:52,643
That's what's really crazy.
You find out that prison guard unions 

1313
00:53:54,091 --> 00:53:55,670
have worked to try to keep marijuana 
illegal.

1314
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,550
You're like,
wow.

1315
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:57,743
Like what you're really saying is we 
want to extract money by putting people 

1316
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:02,550
in cages and says,
you're really saying that's what you get

1317
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:06,290
when you do a private prison industry.
Goddammit,

1318
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:06,931
Dj.
I mean,

1319
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:09,600
I've done videos about this fucking 
private prison industry.

1320
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:11,130
It's crazy.
And you know,

1321
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:13,820
I'm always surprised by just how tap it,
the responses.

1322
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:14,663
People are like,
Eh,

1323
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,201
yeah,
whatever.

1324
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:17,610
You know,
prisoners who gives a shit.

1325
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,241
It's like,
yeah,

1326
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:20,640
but what about the fact that plenty of 
people don't belong to be there?

1327
00:54:20,641 --> 00:54:21,474
What about the fact that these people 
who run these prison industries 

1328
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,833
sponsored legislation to put more people
in jail in a country that already has 

1329
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:28,824
the disproportionately highest prison 
population of any country on the planet 

1330
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,450
while claiming to be the fucking land of
the free?

1331
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,630
Yeah,
we put a fuck load of people in jail.

1332
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,510
Tons.
I think what,

1333
00:54:38,511 --> 00:54:39,630
uh,
what is this statistic?

1334
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:40,523
Some,
some bananas thing about the percentage 

1335
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:43,254
of people to the United States puts in 
jail as opposed to the rest of the 

1336
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:48,780
world.
But the rest of the world kills people.

1337
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:49,561
Yeah.
I mean,

1338
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:50,790
look,
they don't bother me.

1339
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:53,910
Don't bother locking you up as much in 
some other countries.

1340
00:54:53,911 --> 00:54:55,980
They just take out in the back and 
fucking shoot you in the head.

1341
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,700
So you know that mass grave they just 
found no,

1342
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,820
they found a mass grave in Mexico.
Really,

1343
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:06,180
really bad one.
Apparently they've found has made 200 as

1344
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:08,490
many as 250 bodies.
Cartels or,

1345
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,840
yeah.
Yeah.

1346
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,590
See if you can find that Jamie.
It's a creepy story man,

1347
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:17,340
because some teachers found it.
They were looking for something else and

1348
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:18,174
they,
I think they just found some bones and 

1349
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:20,124
they started digging in and they've only
done like an excavation of a certain 

1350
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:28,140
percentage of the land too that they're 
looking at and then look,

1351
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:28,974
it might be as much so there could be 
extensive mass graves throughout the 

1352
00:55:31,531 --> 00:55:33,030
entire area.
Sure.

1353
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:33,864
They didn't know this existed.
Here it is more than 250 human skulls 

1354
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:39,540
found in Mexico.
Jesus.

1355
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,433
Yeah.
Mass grave containing more than 250 

1356
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:45,000
human skulls was uncovered in central 
Mexico.

1357
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:49,230
Most likely the victim of drug cartels 
over the years of Jesus.

1358
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,950
Either then or one very prolific serial 
killer.

1359
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,800
That's a guy who's really getting shit 
done.

1360
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,960
Yeah.
This is terrifying,

1361
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:00,820
man.
And it's really terrifying that this,

1362
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,673
this massive drug war is happening to 
fuel the illegal drug market over here 

1363
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:10,050
and it's happening with a country that's
connected to us.

1364
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:12,810
It's right there.
It was like this massive issue going on,

1365
00:56:12,811 --> 00:56:13,530
right?
Yeah.

1366
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:14,363
And well,
why do you think the build a wall 

1367
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,640
rhetoric is so effective?
Of course.

1368
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,170
Sure.
But it's just even more,

1369
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,290
well that's like,
that's like the least effective option.

1370
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:24,070
It's terrible.
It's just the best option

1371
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,700
would be to make it legal and regulate 
everything and to let adults do whatever

1372
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:30,340
the fuck they want to do.
And if some asshole wants to take math,

1373
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,170
let them take math.
Let them by math.

1374
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,450
Yeah.
He can buy adderall already.

1375
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,120
A lot of these people who are doing 
these crazy drugs,

1376
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:39,700
they're only doing it because better 
drugs aren't available.

1377
00:56:39,701 --> 00:56:41,470
They can't find them.
They're too expensive.

1378
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,333
Like,
if you just legalize and regulate all 

1379
00:56:43,391 --> 00:56:44,230
these markets,
which are,

1380
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:45,183
we know for a fact are going to exist no
matter what because people are just 

1381
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:51,310
going to do fucking drugs,
whether it's legal or not legal.

1382
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,450
Do you know the only variable?
The only thing that I really worry about

1383
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:59,200
though as opiates because I feel like if
you made opiates legal,

1384
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:00,034
if you made them more accessible,
I just know way too many people have 

1385
00:57:02,261 --> 00:57:03,310
lost their lives on them.

1386
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,203
Yeah.
I know way too many people that have 

1387
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:06,394
taken them and then they just,
the whole thing got real slippery and 

1388
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:12,370
they just started fucking up at work and
they do,

1389
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:15,010
we're on them all the time and they got 
real foggy.

1390
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:15,401
I mean,
look,

1391
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:18,340
we live in a country full of obese 
people and uh,

1392
00:57:18,341 --> 00:57:18,850
you know,
I'm,

1393
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,240
I'm pretty obese.
Um,

1394
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,233
that's terrible for your health.
Probably not quite as bad as severe 

1395
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:26,700
opiate addiction.
Nah,

1396
00:57:26,701 --> 00:57:28,030
it's not even close.
But you know,

1397
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:28,864
like it,
it leads to a whole plethora of health 

1398
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:31,030
problems.
And look,

1399
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:31,864
I mean,
like we live in either we believe that 

1400
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:37,120
people have the freedom to make their 
own choices about their own bodies or we

1401
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:37,990
don't.
Right.

1402
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,310
And to me,
you know,

1403
00:57:39,311 --> 00:57:40,144
even if there is negative repercussions,
negative repercussions to being pro 

1404
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:45,100
second amendment,
you know,

1405
00:57:45,101 --> 00:57:45,934
we,
we do have more gun violence because of 

1406
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:47,770
that.

1407
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:51,610
I still believe in the second amendment.
I do believe in probably more regulation

1408
00:57:51,611 --> 00:57:52,444
for it.
But do you just fucked up right there 

1409
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:54,960
son?
Yeah,

1410
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:55,843
he's opened up.
The Gates happened opening the gates of 

1411
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:57,724
hell.
It's like you're smarter than the 

1412
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:01,150
founding fathers.
You're fucking,

1413
00:58:01,151 --> 00:58:03,070
were you going to update the Second 
Amendment?

1414
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:04,503
I mean,
we've already got the damn waffle house 

1415
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:07,650
waiter.
We already updated a plenty of,

1416
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,400
uh,
aspects of the constitution.

1417
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:11,140
Not Officially,
but you know,

1418
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:14,020
like the privacy clause that's just 
fucking gone.

1419
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,420
You know.
So the fourth amendment is just,

1420
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,370
you know,
it's,

1421
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,750
it's basically no and void at this 
point.

1422
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,613
I don't want anybody doing heroin,
but I don't think that it should be 

1423
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:25,270
illegal.
I just,

1424
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,270
I think that stuff,
I,

1425
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,090
I bet in certain circumstances under 
severe pain,

1426
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,690
certain opiates,
especially like natural opiates probably

1427
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:37,090
feel wonderful if you have like a severe
back pain,

1428
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:39,130
you can't rast and you take something 
like that and you can,

1429
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:44,230
the real problem is those fucking pills 
get in people's DNA,

1430
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:44,620
man.

1431
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,453
They,
they get attached to you in some 

1432
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:49,340
terrifying way.
Yeah.

1433
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,673
And they,
people get into the more than almost 

1434
00:58:53,441 --> 00:58:55,600
anything I've ever seen.
And they actually are like,

1435
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:59,020
the gateway drug thing is kind of mocked
because it's attributed to weed.

1436
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,110
Those pills usually our gateway to,
you know,

1437
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:05,920
begin injecting if they don't inject.
I mean they'll inject if it,

1438
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,800
if it works just as good and that's the 
only way they can get it.

1439
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:09,703
Yeah.
And that's what happened with a lot of 

1440
00:59:10,031 --> 00:59:11,660
people in Massachusetts.
It was a,

1441
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,170
one of those episodes of Anthony 
Bourdain's show,

1442
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:17,470
he was out like near,
I forget what area of Massachusetts,

1443
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:22,070
but it was all about how many people had
been devastated by heroin

1444
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:22,903
addiction and heroin overdoses.
And a lot of it came out of the 

1445
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:26,880
oxycontin addictions.
Yeah.

1446
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:30,110
They got the pills really easily.
And then when it became less,

1447
00:59:30,111 --> 00:59:30,944
Lindsay started cramp clamping down the 
regulations and made it harder for 

1448
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:34,634
people to get prescriptions,
then people turn to heroin because they 

1449
00:59:36,801 --> 00:59:38,270
were addicted to opiates.
Right.

1450
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:39,490
Because a,
it was a nap.

1451
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:41,600
It was just a part of who they were at 
that point.

1452
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:44,060
And you know,
the whole country right now,

1453
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:47,150
I mean like,
because of there's a big opiate crisis,

1454
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,013
you know,
they're trying to,

1455
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:48,853
doctors are not writing as many of these
opiate prescriptions and if they're 

1456
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:51,824
trying to make it harder to get,
so a lot more people are turning to 

1457
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:54,344
heroin.
So now we just have a heroin crisis and 

1458
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:58,730
people don't know how much to take and 
they're overdosing and dying.

1459
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:03,290
It's so spooky and yeah,
but if it was regulated,

1460
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,210
um,
you know,

1461
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:07,490
the same people who are already addicted
to it,

1462
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:09,560
who are already going to seek it out or 
are you going to find it?

1463
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:10,933
First of all,
there's no stigma so they can actually 

1464
01:00:12,261 --> 01:00:14,960
go seek fucking treatment for it,
you know?

1465
01:00:14,961 --> 01:00:15,710
Right.
It's pretty,

1466
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:16,543
it's pretty difficult to admit you're a 
heroin addict when you're scared that 

1467
01:00:19,341 --> 01:00:21,470
you might go to fucking jail just for 
what you do.

1468
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:23,023
Well,
they don't use the best stuff to get 

1469
01:00:24,381 --> 01:00:26,000
people off drugs anyway.
Yeah.

1470
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:27,043
Supposedly the most effective,
and this is not from my personal 

1471
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:29,804
experience,
but the most effective drug to get 

1472
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:34,850
people off drugs is that I began stuff I
began,

1473
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:37,160
which is from the Boga Tree.
And uh,

1474
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,013
apparently it has a massive impact on 
people that are addicted to heroin and 

1475
01:00:41,301 --> 01:00:44,660
pills and alcoholics and things along 
those lines.

1476
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,870
Apparently that stuff just fucking 
knocked it right out of your system.

1477
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:49,430
Interesting.
And yeah,

1478
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:52,480
and like really excellent rate of,
um,

1479
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,863
people staying off of it.
Excellent percentage of people stay off 

1480
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:58,940
of it permanently as opposed to a lot of
the other methods.

1481
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:01,010
It's hard for people to change their 
ways,

1482
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:01,844
you know,
that people get into these little 

1483
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:05,450
patterns and they get into these habits 
and if,

1484
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:08,660
if one of those habits also is 
physically addicting as well,

1485
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:10,550
like heroin is,
or like pills are.

1486
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:12,920
Yeah.
It's just really hard for people to kick

1487
01:01:12,921 --> 01:01:14,810
that shit.
It's terrifying to me,

1488
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:17,000
man.
I understand the kind of,

1489
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:18,990
because I do smoke.
Right.

1490
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,200
How much do you smoke?
Uh,

1491
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:22,151
you know,
uh,

1492
01:01:22,151 --> 01:01:22,984
at,
at the worst it was probably like two 

1493
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:25,040
packs a day.
Oh Dude,

1494
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:26,190
that's a lot.
And um,

1495
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:27,463
you know,
now it's probably like half a pack a 

1496
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:29,480
day.
That's better.

1497
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:32,660
I've been down though to as low as like 
three or four cigarettes a day.

1498
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,780
Why don't you just limit yourself to 
something like that?

1499
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:37,183
Uh,
cause the only way I can actually do it 

1500
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:40,183
is to get my girlfriend or my brother or
somebody to Dole them out to me cause I 

1501
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:48,200
don't have the willpower to just say I 
ain't going to do it.

1502
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,230
What if you like?
And then he puts a lot of stress on them

1503
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:54,380
to have to regulate it and me fucking 
bothering them and I'll,

1504
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:55,843
I'll fucking deviously just like sneak 
out and go to the gas station had like 

1505
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:00,860
another pack.
So I'm smoking those four,

1506
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:04,650
but I'm also secretly smoking like 
another four or five off somewhere else.

1507
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:05,940
Well that's ridiculous.
Yeah,

1508
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,010
I'm terrible.
Yeah,

1509
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,140
that's absolutely awful.
Do you,

1510
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:09,974
uh,
have a problem with that type of 

1511
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:13,640
behavior or accepted?
No,

1512
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,260
no,
no.

1513
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,250
I realize when I'm doing it like,
wow,

1514
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:17,840
I'm a total piece of shit for doing 
this.

1515
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:19,530
You,
you know,

1516
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:23,290
is it just the moment feel so good to 
suck on that cigarette to feed?

1517
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,440
It's really not because it's fucking 
horrible.

1518
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:26,730
Every time I smoke a cigarette,
I'm like,

1519
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:28,420
why am I doing this?
Huh.

1520
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:33,680
But what happens is there's that moment 
before or more than a moment,

1521
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:35,490
like the,
the lead up to smoking a cigarette.

1522
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,630
It's like,
God damn,

1523
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,420
pet cigarette.
When I get it,

1524
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:41,320
it's going to be so fucking good.
Really.

1525
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,380
It's going to make me feel just fine and
all this.

1526
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:44,970
And then I start smoking.
I'm like,

1527
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:46,320
man,
this fucking sucks.

1528
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:47,963
And then I put all smoke it or I'll 
smoke half of it and put it out or 

1529
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:51,960
whatever.
And then,

1530
01:02:51,961 --> 01:02:53,310
you know,
next thing I know,

1531
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,530
30 minutes to an hour later it's like,
man,

1532
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,820
that next cigarette I smoke,
it's going to be so fucking nice.

1533
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,200
Oh,
okay.

1534
01:03:01,201 --> 01:03:04,620
So it's the feeling before the cigarette
that you,

1535
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:09,621
the anticipation and the immediate 
reward is what the immediate reward is.

1536
01:03:10,111 --> 01:03:11,670
Like.
Disappointment.

1537
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,720
Really.
It's just like,

1538
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:13,590
this sucks.
This is,

1539
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,453
this doesn't taste good.
This isn't really changing my brain 

1540
01:03:17,401 --> 01:03:20,520
chemistry in a significant enough way.
It looks cool though.

1541
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,020
It,
you know what rebel,

1542
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:24,150
the visual element is nice.

1543
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:28,170
I like seeing the smoke just fucking 
climb up and shit.

1544
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,213
Yeah.
That big fucking little stream of smoke 

1545
01:03:31,561 --> 01:03:32,394
and it curls around and gets bigger and 
does all those fucking little weird 

1546
01:03:35,431 --> 01:03:36,264
acrobatics and shit.
But it does put you into a certain 

1547
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:39,414
mindset if you're acknowledging that 
you're doing something absolutely 

1548
01:03:42,271 --> 01:03:44,430
ridiculous.
This detrimental to your health.

1549
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:44,881
Yeah,
no,

1550
01:03:44,881 --> 01:03:45,870
it is.
There's no,

1551
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,900
there's no debate.
There's no division,

1552
01:03:47,901 --> 01:03:49,050
not a terrible it,
and you're like,

1553
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:52,290
I'm going to fuck as naive and I don't 
give a fuck though.

1554
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,270
I'm just,
I'm just fucking stupid.

1555
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,770
It's just like,
wow,

1556
01:03:55,771 --> 01:03:58,770
I'm just a fucking drone for this shit.
It's a little bit of that,

1557
01:03:58,771 --> 01:03:59,604
but it's a little bit of,
I want this cigarette in my body right 

1558
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:04,620
now more than I want to be healthy 
later.

1559
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,633
Yeah,
exactly.

1560
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:08,490
That's true.
Cause you're healthy enough to smoke it.

1561
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:09,930
Instant gratification.

1562
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:10,883
Instant.
You'd just given a little piece of 

1563
01:04:12,781 --> 01:04:17,781
yourself to death.
Just a little piece.

1564
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,070
Yeah.
Just let me take a little piece.

1565
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,200
Ego Death.
Yeah.

1566
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:23,070
You're just going to give you a little 
bit of my life force.

1567
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:26,310
You just take that and in exchange I'll 
puff on this stupid.

1568
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:27,283
Yeah.
It's like there's a bank of stick of 

1569
01:04:27,721 --> 01:04:29,070
leaves.
How much she put in.

1570
01:04:29,071 --> 01:04:30,840
How much do you take out and when 
you're,

1571
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:32,550
when you're smoking cigarettes,
you're greedy.

1572
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:36,230
Who take a lot out of your account.
Yeah.

1573
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,480
Just digging into your account and all 
of sudden,

1574
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,870
you know,
you go to the shop and you're like,

1575
01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:41,010
yeah,
can I get this on credit?

1576
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:41,521
And like,
dude,

1577
01:04:41,521 --> 01:04:43,620
you're out of credit.
Oh it's over.

1578
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,020
Damn,
you fucked up your lung son.

1579
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:48,570
He burnt them off.
Yeah.

1580
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:49,920
That's really what kind of,
what it is.

1581
01:04:49,921 --> 01:04:50,940
Right.
I agree.

1582
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,760
I don't have any argument with that 
analogy.

1583
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,530
I don't know.
Wouldn't say stop doing it if you don't,

1584
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:57,730
if you don't feel like,
you know,

1585
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:58,580
I'm,
I'm,

1586
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,730
I'm uh,
uh,

1587
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:02,610
I went to my fucking a doctor recently 
and they,

1588
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,520
they gave me a book and I haven't read 
it yet,

1589
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:08,460
but it's supposedly it's going to help.
So on cigarettes.

1590
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,363
Yeah.
I'm Mike Lacey who owns a comedy and 

1591
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:12,534
magic club.
His wife works with people that have 

1592
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:17,460
terminal lung cancer.
Yeah.

1593
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,330
And he was explaining how they die and 
he's explaining that you're essentially,

1594
01:05:22,331 --> 01:05:26,170
you're drowning in your own fluid and 
that you're,

1595
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:29,050
you're,
you're gasping for air as you leave this

1596
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:29,960
life.
Yeah.

1597
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:33,760
He goes and people are in sheer horror 
and terror and he said,

1598
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:37,570
it is not something you ever want to do.
The fucking,

1599
01:05:37,571 --> 01:05:40,540
uh,
the smokers war or some shit,

1600
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,000
man,
maybe should I fit.

1601
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:46,240
Thing is when they go bad,
they go bad away from us.

1602
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,313
They go bad there in those hospitals 
somewhere locked up in a room and the 

1603
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:50,764
nurses get to see them and they'll tell 
you the nurses are the ones once you 

1604
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:54,454
talk to,
if you want to find out how horrible it 

1605
01:05:55,631 --> 01:05:57,460
is to watch someone die from lung 
cancer.

1606
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:58,563
Yeah.
Well the way Mike Lacey was explaining 

1607
01:06:01,031 --> 01:06:01,864
it to brian red band,
but meanwhile went right in there and 

1608
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:08,800
write out there and fell on the ground.
Yeah.

1609
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:10,510
You know,
that could happen.

1610
01:06:10,511 --> 01:06:11,980
Right.
And hit by a bus tomorrow,

1611
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,410
but not live forever anyway.
Yeah.

1612
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,590
Just too much,
too much a desire to get that,

1613
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,600
that feel.
It's also,

1614
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:22,690
it's like a rebellious attitude that 
goes with it.

1615
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,040
I don't give a fuck about my health.
Why do I give a fuck about anything?

1616
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:27,931
Yeah.
I mean,

1617
01:06:27,931 --> 01:06:29,500
I,
I do have problems,

1618
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:30,383
uh,
finding like things to be passionate 

1619
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:33,460
about or care about.

1620
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:34,683
Um,
but I guess in some ways I've tried to 

1621
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:39,910
cultivate that because you know,
like George Carlin and shit.

1622
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:43,150
Yeah.
Like I loved that idea of,

1623
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,531
yeah.
I'm just,

1624
01:06:44,531 --> 01:06:46,000
I'm an observer here.
Like,

1625
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:46,834
I'm not going to be part of this.
I'm just going to look at it from the 

1626
01:06:48,581 --> 01:06:51,840
outside and be detached from it.
And I've tried to,

1627
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,710
I've kind of tried to cultivate that in 
myself,

1628
01:06:53,711 --> 01:06:55,810
but I've also noticed like it's kind of 
hard to,

1629
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:00,550
to draw upon my own passions the more I 
do that.

1630
01:07:00,551 --> 01:07:03,340
So I don't know if I need to find a 
happier medium or what.

1631
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:06,490
But that's interesting.
So in your analysis of a subject,

1632
01:07:06,491 --> 01:07:08,620
like when you're doing these youtube 
videos,

1633
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,480
you almost like an outsider looking in 
and you,

1634
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,333
you feel like there's like,
there's like a good strategy to that 

1635
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:16,730
maybe are a good,
uh,

1636
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:19,720
I think it's,
I try to make it,

1637
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:23,620
I guess I try to use it as like a thing 
to bolster objectivity.

1638
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:27,460
Like I don't want to be just saying what
the crowd wants to hear,

1639
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,473
right?
I don't want to be a just saying things 

1640
01:07:31,241 --> 01:07:34,030
because I think like this is gonna be 
the most entertaining or whatever.

1641
01:07:34,031 --> 01:07:37,330
Like I want it to be like,
here's what I really fucking think about

1642
01:07:37,331 --> 01:07:38,164
this.
And I think you have to have like some 

1643
01:07:41,081 --> 01:07:43,150
kind of a wall of detachment because you
know,

1644
01:07:43,151 --> 01:07:45,460
people aren't always going to react well
to it and shit too.

1645
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:47,950
Yeah,
that's a really good point.

1646
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:52,080
You almost have to be in this sort of 
antisocial place because you,

1647
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:55,840
if you're too social with these people,
you won't judge them correctly.

1648
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,003
I mean like,
look,

1649
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:59,440
people are very worried about,
um,

1650
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,580
especially lately about like advertising
and Shit influencing,

1651
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,250
uh,
what people do and say,

1652
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,350
but like,
people don't really realize that it's,

1653
01:08:10,351 --> 01:08:11,184
it's,
it's really just as much of a danger to 

1654
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:16,280
become beholden to the audience or to 
the

1655
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:18,890
mob and to go along with,
here's the,

1656
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:21,350
here's what we really want to hear from 
you for sure.

1657
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:22,280
And it's like,
well,

1658
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:23,143
maybe I might be what you want to hear,
but that's not what I'm gonna fucking 

1659
01:08:24,711 --> 01:08:26,000
say.
Hey Tj,

1660
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,740
how about you stick to this?
Yeah,

1661
01:08:27,741 --> 01:08:30,440
exactly.
To go back to your lane,

1662
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,670
what's your lane,
Bro?

1663
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:32,391
Yeah.
I mean,

1664
01:08:32,391 --> 01:08:35,250
I'm sure you sound like you've 
experienced this as well.

1665
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:37,103
Look,
there are a lot of people out there in 

1666
01:08:40,621 --> 01:08:41,454
this world and if you want to get 
opinions from every single one of them 

1667
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:47,250
and consider them individually without 
meeting any of those people,

1668
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,250
to me that's shitty data.
Okay.

1669
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,200
That's not good data.
If I know you,

1670
01:08:52,201 --> 01:08:53,034
I've talked to you.
If you tell me something and you're 

1671
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:55,920
smart guy,
I'll consider,

1672
01:08:55,921 --> 01:08:56,754
I'll be like,
okay,

1673
01:08:57,150 --> 01:08:57,983
well I know Tj and Tj was saying that he
wouldn't be saying it if he didn't 

1674
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:01,344
believe it.
So I have to think about what he's 

1675
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:05,160
saying and I'll have to go through my 
head and find out whether or not I agree

1676
01:09:05,161 --> 01:09:07,470
with them.
I'd have to objectively look at it.

1677
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,530
You could be talking to a million insane
people.

1678
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:11,483
You really,
there's no way you could individually 

1679
01:09:13,921 --> 01:09:14,754
react to each one of them,
but you can get a sense of whether or 

1680
01:09:17,701 --> 01:09:19,290
not people were upset at you or not.
Oh,

1681
01:09:19,291 --> 01:09:20,124
sure.
It can get a sense of whether or not 

1682
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:24,990
logical people make sense.
Like that makes sense.

1683
01:09:24,991 --> 01:09:26,250
Feel like you've crossed a line.

1684
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:26,681
Look,
I've,

1685
01:09:26,681 --> 01:09:30,040
I've noticed this really weird shift in 
the Zeit geist um,

1686
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:33,520
in the last like year or so.
Um,

1687
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,980
and it kind of started with this whole 
fake news thing.

1688
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,713
You know,
the left was saying the trump got in 

1689
01:09:40,061 --> 01:09:42,030
because of fake news and then trump 
saying,

1690
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:42,883
oh,
they'll all the attacks against me or 

1691
01:09:43,781 --> 01:09:46,120
fake news.
And uh,

1692
01:09:46,121 --> 01:09:48,400
I've seen on Youtube,
I'm like,

1693
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,350
we used to do this kayfabe stuff on our 
show.

1694
01:09:50,351 --> 01:09:52,780
Kayfabe is like wrestling talk for like,
you know,

1695
01:09:52,930 --> 01:09:54,370
fake,
you know,

1696
01:09:54,371 --> 01:09:54,711
the,
the,

1697
01:09:54,711 --> 01:09:55,070
the,
the,

1698
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,350
the,
the pageantry of it.

1699
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,240
Like we're just pretending drama and 
shit.

1700
01:09:58,241 --> 01:09:59,440
We used to do it all the time on my 
show,

1701
01:09:59,441 --> 01:10:02,770
the drunken peasants podcast.
Suddenly people turned on it.

1702
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:04,330
They're like,
we don't want this anymore.

1703
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,800
And it's it,
you know,

1704
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,780
and I got,
I got shit because I did this,

1705
01:10:07,781 --> 01:10:10,150
a sponsored ad for this app called 
candid.

1706
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:11,883
And people are like,
you know,

1707
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:15,320
everything you say is bullshit because 
you did this sponsored spot for candid,

1708
01:10:15,321 --> 01:10:17,740
and you're fucking a shill.
So we dismiss you.

1709
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:22,150
And it's because everyone's on this big 
fucking authenticity kick.

1710
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:26,530
But they're not really actually 
skeptical though.

1711
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,520
They're,
they're just,

1712
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:30,640
they just want a demagogue to spew.
Like,

1713
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:31,773
here's what you already think is true.
I am here to validate all of your 

1714
01:10:34,661 --> 01:10:35,494
feelings and all of your opinions.
And a lot of these people seem to want 

1715
01:10:38,771 --> 01:10:41,920
me to be that,
but I'm not that.

1716
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:43,653
Yeah,
they,

1717
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:47,170
they're going to want you to form to 
whatever their opinion of you is.

1718
01:10:47,171 --> 01:10:48,004
And if you deviate from that,
there's going to be a certain amount of 

1719
01:10:50,261 --> 01:10:53,440
people that are going to be upset,
but it's up to you to,

1720
01:10:53,441 --> 01:10:56,800
to figure out,
like what is the worst thing,

1721
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:57,663
I think for any,
any performer or artist is to get boxed 

1722
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:02,224
into like kind of a fake thing.
Like maybe a character that you do or 

1723
01:11:05,411 --> 01:11:07,570
something along those lines and then you
can't get out of it.

1724
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,080
Rick James Bitch.
Yeah.

1725
01:11:09,081 --> 01:11:09,910
Well like,
yeah,

1726
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:14,110
like Bobcat goldthwait had the hardest 
time because he had that I,

1727
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:14,963
you know,
the character that he would do with 

1728
01:11:15,451 --> 01:11:17,340
screaming and yelling bobcat character.
Yeah.

1729
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:21,060
And then he wanted to just eventually b 
Bob Goldthwaite and people like,

1730
01:11:21,061 --> 01:11:22,140
no,
fuck that man.

1731
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,003
Where's the bobcat thing?
Like it took him years to get away from 

1732
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:27,480
that.
He got his films by the way.

1733
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:27,871
Oh,
it's,

1734
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:28,704
films are great.
Did you see the big foot movie know 

1735
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,430
Willow Creek?
It's haven't seen any horror movie.

1736
01:11:32,431 --> 01:11:33,840
It's really good.
Is it?

1737
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:34,823
It's,
he did it like a Blair witch project 

1738
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:40,620
type thing of these people up there,
a sasquatch hunting.

1739
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,850
And,
uh,

1740
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:43,840
look,
I don't want to say anymore,

1741
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,220
but I'm pretty skeptic.
I'm,

1742
01:11:45,221 --> 01:11:47,690
I'm like a big skeptic.
I don't believe in a lot of this stuff,

1743
01:11:47,691 --> 01:11:48,524
but I'm really fascinated by things like
big foot and aliens and the lochness 

1744
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,460
monster in the flat earth and the hollow
worth and all this stuff.

1745
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,950
Don't believe in any of it.
In fact,

1746
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:00,620
I think most of it's like totally 
fucking ridiculous.

1747
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,550
But I find it really fascinating,
um,

1748
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,740
because I kind of view it as like almost
like modern mythology.

1749
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:07,850
You know,
you,

1750
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:10,310
you kind of see the genesis of how 
people talk.

1751
01:12:10,311 --> 01:12:11,144
You know,
people used to talk about like suck 

1752
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:14,720
buses coming in in the night and you 
know,

1753
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:15,763
stealing their,
their essence and shit and seducing 

1754
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:18,824
them,
you know?

1755
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:19,733
Um,
and you kind of see like the modern 

1756
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:21,794
versions of that is like the alien that 
takes you up and it was ship and shoves 

1757
01:12:24,051 --> 01:12:26,690
a probe up your ass or whatever.
Yeah.

1758
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:30,460
Well I think alien,
the alien thing absolutely has something

1759
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:31,294
to do with dreaming 100%,
because a giant percentage of these 

1760
01:12:35,111 --> 01:12:35,944
abduction events occur when someone's 
either napping or when someone's 

1761
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:40,780
sleeping.
It's a,

1762
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:43,630
they're always unconscious sleep 
paralysis.

1763
01:12:43,631 --> 01:12:44,460
Yeah.
Well,

1764
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,650
it's not even just that.
It's,

1765
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:50,560
it's probably psychedelic compound 
compounds that are released in the brain

1766
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:51,423
during rem sleep.
The reason why you have these wacky 

1767
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,280
fucking dreams,
I mean,

1768
01:12:54,281 --> 01:12:57,670
you have dreams that are so insane.
They're like a psychedelic trip.

1769
01:12:57,690 --> 01:12:59,360
Yeah.
Like an imagination.

1770
01:12:59,361 --> 01:13:01,480
It has control of the psychedelic 
chemicals,

1771
01:13:01,481 --> 01:13:03,490
a power your brain and runs you on a 
trip.

1772
01:13:03,491 --> 01:13:04,301
I mean,
that's where are,

1773
01:13:04,301 --> 01:13:04,450
or,

1774
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:06,250
um,
I had,

1775
01:13:06,251 --> 01:13:07,084
uh,
I don't really suffer from it too bad 

1776
01:13:08,081 --> 01:13:09,180
anymore,
but like in,

1777
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:14,020
in my late teens and early twenties,
I had really bad sleep paralysis.

1778
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,190
Whoa.
And,

1779
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:16,120
uh,
also,

1780
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,320
uh,
a company that was a,

1781
01:13:17,321 --> 01:13:18,154
I forget if it's called hypnopompic 
hallucinations or hypnagogic 

1782
01:13:20,111 --> 01:13:22,300
hallucinations,
but,

1783
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:23,740
um,
I could tell you right,

1784
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,730
you know,
like,

1785
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,233
uh,
I'll be laying in bed or I would be at 

1786
01:13:28,961 --> 01:13:31,030
the time and,
um,

1787
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:36,040
I would kind of wake up but I wouldn't 
be able to move my body.

1788
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:36,671
And then,
you know,

1789
01:13:36,671 --> 01:13:38,230
and,
and aside from that,

1790
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:39,843
you feel the overwhelming sense of like 
there's another presence here and it's 

1791
01:13:46,391 --> 01:13:49,030
ominous and you fucking,
uh,

1792
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:50,203
if you have the hypnagogic 
hallucinations or hypnopompic 

1793
01:13:51,971 --> 01:13:53,830
hallucinations that there one is when 
you're,

1794
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:55,480
you hallucinate as you're going into 
sleep.

1795
01:13:55,481 --> 01:13:56,980
One is when you loosening as they're 
coming out,

1796
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,200
I have the one where you hallucinate or 
coming out of sleep.

1797
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:01,023
So I would wake up and uh,
probably the first time it happened I 

1798
01:14:04,631 --> 01:14:09,631
was 11 and I saw this robe to figure 
like walk across my bedroom.

1799
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:12,820
And then when I was 15,

1800
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,520
what did it look like?
A real thing.

1801
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:17,650
Oh yeah.
Like it looked totally real.

1802
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,330
It didn't look like it was transparent,
right?

1803
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:20,290
No,
no,

1804
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:21,470
no.
It just like,

1805
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,000
it didn't look like a dude.
Cause there was like four feet tall.

1806
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,080
Oh look,
a gnome.

1807
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,200
Yeah.
I mean I,

1808
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:30,820
I assumed it was like,
because my uncle is a big Ufo guy,

1809
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:31,654
so I'm like,
I saw an alien and at the time I was 

1810
01:14:33,461 --> 01:14:37,240
convinced to that.
Later I became more skeptical and when I

1811
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:42,241
was like 15 I woke up and I saw this 
fucking a figure standing at the foot of

1812
01:14:43,481 --> 01:14:46,210
my bed.
You ever seen the movie dark city?

1813
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:47,253
Yes.
It did that sleep thing from dark city 

1814
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:50,950
and I was like,
okay.

1815
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:53,440
And I went back to sleep.
Holy Shit.

1816
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:55,210
I woke up the next morning.
I'm like,

1817
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:56,980
uh,
if that happens again,

1818
01:14:56,981 --> 01:14:58,510
I'm going to fucking tackle this thing.

1819
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,730
You sure that wasn't just a dream?
Uh,

1820
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,610
I'm pretty sure I was awake because the 
fall,

1821
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,210
the fall of two weeks later I saw it 
again and I did like,

1822
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,044
I plan to do,
I fucking jumped up and I tried to 

1823
01:15:09,431 --> 01:15:10,264
tackle it.
It just kind of disappeared in my arms 

1824
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,490
when I got to it too.
And I was like,

1825
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:17,140
okay,
well that was okay.

1826
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:17,470
I'm,
I'm,

1827
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:18,303
I was relieved because I'm like,
it was obviously a hallucination and I 

1828
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:20,704
look up and it's fucking head is 
floating there and it just done this 

1829
01:15:24,251 --> 01:15:26,020
head vanishes.
Whoa.

1830
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:28,720
Um,
but these are just hallucinations.

1831
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:29,583
I mean maybe,
maybe if they're not houses hard 

1832
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:34,760
interdimensional beings,
how do you know cause uh,

1833
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,440
sound so confident.
I've read pretty extensively about it.

1834
01:15:38,441 --> 01:15:39,730
Cause like when that shit happens to 
you,

1835
01:15:39,731 --> 01:15:41,830
you want to know like what's going on 
here.

1836
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:46,690
So when they can,
they can induce that state and uh,

1837
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:47,583
you know,
like they can put you into sleep 

1838
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:49,804
paralysis and you'll feel the presence 
and you'll experience seeing things and 

1839
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:53,020
all that stuff.

1840
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:53,853
They can put you in that mindset.
It's a matter of electrically 

1841
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:58,030
stimulating certain areas of the scalp.
Right.

1842
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,560
Yeah.
Which is really fascinating,

1843
01:15:59,561 --> 01:16:00,394
isn't it?
That they can actually target areas of 

1844
01:16:01,811 --> 01:16:05,530
the scalp and induce certain feelings 
and certain thoughts.

1845
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,930
Yeah.
We kind of delved into this last time we

1846
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:08,764
talked.
Yeah.

1847
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:11,740
Consciousness and the afterlife,
things of that nature.

1848
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:16,890
I wonder though,
like what would cause you to recall like

1849
01:16:17,591 --> 01:16:20,020
an image from a really fucking cool 
movie like that?

1850
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:23,920
And have it be like what would weird 
combination of things would cause,

1851
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:27,940
you know like when I was reading causes 
a hallucination to take a certain storm.

1852
01:16:27,941 --> 01:16:28,774
Like what is it?
Is it your insecurities and fears is 

1853
01:16:30,731 --> 01:16:31,540
you're,
you're,

1854
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:32,373
you're nightmarish vision of,
it's the same thing that leads you to 

1855
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:37,150
have certain visions and dreams and 
things.

1856
01:16:37,151 --> 01:16:37,984
I mean like it's part of your memory and
psychology just manifest imagination as 

1857
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:41,980
well.

1858
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:42,813
Yeah.
Yeah.

1859
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:43,940
Like A,
there was a guy,

1860
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:44,813
uh,
I was reading about his experiences and 

1861
01:16:45,581 --> 01:16:46,870
he,
he would see the,

1862
01:16:46,871 --> 01:16:47,704
the,
the guy from the front of the extra 

1863
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:49,720
poster.
Oh,

1864
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:50,411
Shannon,
his room.

1865
01:16:50,411 --> 01:16:52,840
He'd see that that silhouette holding 
the,

1866
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,600
the briefcase and Shit and looking up at
the bill.

1867
01:16:55,601 --> 01:16:57,730
The building dude,
when I was a kid,

1868
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,593
that movie was fucking terrifying.
Like you could watch it today and never 

1869
01:17:04,001 --> 01:17:07,660
fully impact what it did to people like 
me.

1870
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,003
What year is that?
Like I want to say it was like 76 does 

1871
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:14,360
that make sense?
Which means I was like nine years old.

1872
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,850
Find out what,
what year the extras this was,

1873
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,790
what year was that?
I remember seeing the 25th anniversary.

1874
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:22,490
73 isn't like 73,
so I was younger than that.

1875
01:17:22,491 --> 01:17:24,020
Who the fuck?
Let me watch that.

1876
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:25,400
That's ridiculous.
Mom,

1877
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,200
mom,
how dare you?

1878
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,393
But uh,
I remember being scared out of my 

1879
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:33,290
fucking mind at this movie.
Yeah,

1880
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:35,480
there's that.
There's the image that movie fucked with

1881
01:17:35,481 --> 01:17:36,314
my head for years and I started thinking
about demons and the idea of being 

1882
01:17:39,681 --> 01:17:41,680
possessed and what could happen.
Yeah.

1883
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:43,580
He watched it today.
You'll laugh your ass off.

1884
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,340
Oh yeah.
I was watching,

1885
01:17:46,341 --> 01:17:47,174
I was watching that movie a at my 
uncle's house and my mom came in the 

1886
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:50,294
room and she,
she's like really easily frightened and 

1887
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:54,050
stuff and she just thought it was 
hilarious.

1888
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,970
The extra assist is hilarious.
I mean,

1889
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:56,813
it's funny by today's standard,
but like if you go watch it in the 

1890
01:17:58,131 --> 01:17:58,964
context of like watch horror movies that
came around around the same time and 

1891
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:03,230
before it,
and it's like,

1892
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,153
okay,
you can kind of see why this blew 

1893
01:18:05,061 --> 01:18:06,910
people's minds at the time.
Well,

1894
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,170
when it happened,
when that movie came out,

1895
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:12,530
they had never been anything like on 
that level.

1896
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:13,363
We're a little cute little girl had,
becomes a demon and starts ramming 

1897
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,920
across and do her pussy.
Yeah.

1898
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:22,430
Just fuck me father.
Fuck my father's slamming.

1899
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:24,050
Which saint fuck me.
Jesus.

1900
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,940
Which what did she,
she was just saying fuck me.

1901
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:28,100
I don't remember whether she was like,
fuck me.

1902
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,120
Fuck me.
Oh,

1903
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,310
Jesus Christ.
I like what she's like,

1904
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:33,650
yeah.
I'm not a Saas Cox and hell yeah.

1905
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:35,930
It was a beautiful moment in cinematic 
history.

1906
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:36,793
I couldn't believe that that was 
actually in a movie that they said that 

1907
01:18:39,021 --> 01:18:39,801
in a movie.
Yeah.

1908
01:18:39,801 --> 01:18:43,610
I mean like she was having trouble 
getting away with that fucking now given

1909
01:18:43,611 --> 01:18:45,350
the age of the actress.
Oh,

1910
01:18:45,351 --> 01:18:47,900
they wouldn't be allowed to.
It would be illegal now.

1911
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,520
It would,
it would be illegal.

1912
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:50,540
No,
no,

1913
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:52,370
it didn't,
it didn't like show anything.

1914
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,380
Uh,
but yeah,

1915
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:57,260
it would probably be controversial even 
if it was made.

1916
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:59,450
Just making that little kid act like 
that.

1917
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:01,580
Yeah.
Look at those pictures of her,

1918
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:03,830
like when she was screaming and yelling,
first of all,

1919
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:07,130
that little kid was fucking terrifyingly
good.

1920
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:07,941
Oh yeah.
And you know,

1921
01:19:07,941 --> 01:19:08,511
the,
they,

1922
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:08,960
they,
uh,

1923
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,540
she was,
they didn't have much,

1924
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:12,403
well,
like care for her wellbeing or anything 

1925
01:19:13,311 --> 01:19:13,881
either.
Cause like,

1926
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:14,714
you know,
that scene where she's spasming and 

1927
01:19:15,801 --> 01:19:17,990
flopping up and down.
They were doing that with wires and that

1928
01:19:17,991 --> 01:19:19,820
fucked her backup for life.
Really?

1929
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,580
Yeah.
Oh Man.

1930
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:26,060
Total disregard for,
for her safety or wellbeing.

1931
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:29,480
Fucked her backup for life when she was 
a little kid making his movie.

1932
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:30,810
Yup.
Wow.

1933
01:19:30,811 --> 01:19:32,750
Like what did it do to her back?
Do you know specifically?

1934
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,610
I don't know.
It just gave her back back issues.

1935
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:36,890
I don't know if they were severe or 
what,

1936
01:19:36,891 --> 01:19:37,724
but she,
something got polled or something got 

1937
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,990
out of alignment.
I mean,

1938
01:19:41,991 --> 01:19:44,930
you saw how violently they had flopping 
up and down on that bed.

1939
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:46,490
Yeah.
That's not good.

1940
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:47,511
So,
you know,

1941
01:19:47,511 --> 01:19:48,710
the,
the standards were different,

1942
01:19:48,711 --> 01:19:49,960
I guess at the time,
but,

1943
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:52,220
but uh,
I think most people should realize,

1944
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:53,300
don't,
uh,

1945
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:56,840
don't permanently injure a child just to
get an effect.

1946
01:19:56,841 --> 01:20:00,080
You want in a movie.
My kids are watching this TV show.

1947
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:02,180
It's like an old Disney show called good
luck,

1948
01:20:02,181 --> 01:20:03,070
Charlie.
Yeah.

1949
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,590
And Charlie's a little baby.
It's a baby.

1950
01:20:06,591 --> 01:20:08,040
Baby is the cutest little baby,

1951
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,540
but it's a baby.
Yeah,

1952
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:13,920
like maybe a year old or maybe two at 
the most like it's tiny little thing.

1953
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:15,383
And that's the bane character.
Like imagine like not only do you not 

1954
01:20:20,071 --> 01:20:22,500
get to choose whether or not you want to
be famous,

1955
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:24,390
want to be an actor cause you're a 
fucking baby.

1956
01:20:24,391 --> 01:20:25,224
You can't even talk yet.
You're already on tv but the whole 

1957
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:31,530
show's about you so you can't quit.
Yeah.

1958
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:32,364
And you know,
I was wondering like it when I'm 

1959
01:20:33,331 --> 01:20:34,164
watching movies,
like you see babies like crying and 

1960
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:38,310
stuff and you know like how they make 
that baby cry,

1961
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,960
they bite them.
Does this seem ethical?

1962
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:42,240
It doesn't really seem ethical.
Definitely not ethical.

1963
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:46,470
It's fucked up man.
That's why when people are like make fun

1964
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:50,940
of that a American sniper movie for 
using that little shitty plastic baby.

1965
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:52,230
Oh it was obviously fake.

1966
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:53,063
I'm like whatever.
It's better than fucking having some 

1967
01:20:55,591 --> 01:20:58,890
real kid and getting it to cry and stuff
and whatever.

1968
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,040
I blame clinics went on that.
Like you should have phrased that better

1969
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:04,470
to frame away from that.
You could have sold it better.

1970
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,490
Yeah,
you could.

1971
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,200
You could have filmed that in a 
different way.

1972
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:10,620
He films things a lot of times in a very
sort of traditional way.

1973
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:11,503
Yeah,
he's a great director and everything 

1974
01:21:12,121 --> 01:21:12,954
like that.
But how the hell did he not see that 

1975
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:16,160
rubber baby?
They'll look so funny.

1976
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:18,470
He's pretty old,
you know,

1977
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,290
give him,
give him a little,

1978
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:20,123
I guess,
but somebody there with them in the 

1979
01:21:21,451 --> 01:21:22,500
editing room,
going home,

1980
01:21:22,501 --> 01:21:24,840
street swept off.
It's rubber baby.

1981
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:25,770
It's pretty obvious.
Who's going to,

1982
01:21:25,771 --> 01:21:27,930
who's going to tell dirty harry that the
scene doesn't work?

1983
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:29,790
Did you know?
I know,

1984
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:31,740
I got it.
Remember when,

1985
01:21:31,741 --> 01:21:33,810
uh,
that whole movie was,

1986
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,480
that was a weird time when that movie 
came out.

1987
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,490
That was like a movie where you had to 
say you liked it.

1988
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:40,980
If you didn't say you liked it,
you risk violence.

1989
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,140
I just,
I just didn't see it,

1990
01:21:43,141 --> 01:21:45,900
so I seen it.
I've seen it since then,

1991
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:49,980
but at the time I didn't watch it.
It just wasn't a very good movie.

1992
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:53,580
Now a lot of people love the movie and 
to them it was really good.

1993
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:54,780
To me it was,
it was,

1994
01:21:54,781 --> 01:21:58,860
it was like so much,
and this is probably my personal bias of

1995
01:21:58,861 --> 01:21:59,694
like being out here and being in 
Hollywood and knowing how writers work 

1996
01:22:03,271 --> 01:22:04,360
and knowing how,
you know,

1997
01:22:04,361 --> 01:22:05,194
like they,
they structure these things and how 

1998
01:22:06,961 --> 01:22:07,794
this,
what kind of effect the studio wants to 

1999
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:10,950
have on the audience.
For big mainstream movie,

2000
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:16,130
you could feel like the heavy hand of of
Hollywood all over it and you could feel

2001
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:20,100
like the way they were,
the wording,

2002
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:24,090
the things that he said and the just all
the whole thing was like so affected.

2003
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:25,103
It's like I'm,
I'm not getting a good sense of what 

2004
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:28,830
this guy's real life.
It was propaganda.

2005
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:31,080
Yeah.
And then you know,

2006
01:22:31,081 --> 01:22:31,914
and then you find out about the Jesse 
Ventura thing where Jesse Ventura sued 

2007
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:38,760
him because he made up some story and 
them up.

2008
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:39,603
And apparently there was a few other 
stories that weren't true as well that 

2009
01:22:42,631 --> 01:22:46,680
were in that book that fucked a Jesse 
venture is a career up a little bit too.

2010
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,240
Yeah.
He was just don,

2011
01:22:48,241 --> 01:22:49,074
he was talking about it.
It cost him over a million dollars in 

2012
01:22:51,061 --> 01:22:51,980
legal fees.
Yeah.

2013
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:54,100
And he's been doing it for what,
four years now.

2014
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:56,280
Got a judgment in his favor,
but then they,

2015
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:59,730
they did shift lead,
took it away somehow.

2016
01:22:59,731 --> 01:23:01,440
I forget.
They lost on appeal.

2017
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,910
It's not good.
The whole thing is not good because hey,

2018
01:23:03,911 --> 01:23:05,680
he's a hero.
Well

2019
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,360
it's,
it's really,

2020
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:09,200
it's just,
you know,

2021
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,093
the truth is truth and you,
you can't just make stuff up about 

2022
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:13,354
people and you know,
maybe he should've dropped the lawsuit 

2023
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:17,560
when the guy died.
You know,

2024
01:23:17,561 --> 01:23:19,720
maybe that would have been better for 
everybody,

2025
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:22,630
but that this his decision,
he felt like he was wrong.

2026
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,430
Then he felt like he was going after the
publishers.

2027
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:27,100
When the legend becomes truth print the 
legend.

2028
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:28,510
Yeah.
Sorry.

2029
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,153
It's just,
I think also you're dealing with the 

2030
01:23:33,281 --> 01:23:34,114
pressures of war being so alien to most 
people that when you and I who have not 

2031
01:23:40,421 --> 01:23:41,470
been to war,
sit,

2032
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,333
sit around talking and debating about 
what it's like to be like the most 

2033
01:23:45,041 --> 01:23:45,874
decorated sniper ever.
Or a guy who experiences that much 

2034
01:23:48,911 --> 01:23:49,744
action and sees that much death and to 
really try to rationalize what goes in 

2035
01:23:53,201 --> 01:23:56,650
and out of their mind and like what 
their grasp on reality is like.

2036
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:59,680
And then there's also the opportunity 
that this guy has.

2037
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:02,260
If you're leaving the military and 
writing a book,

2038
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:03,363
why not just make a bunch of crazy shit 
up and make it even better to sell more 

2039
01:24:06,491 --> 01:24:08,080
fucking books?
You know?

2040
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:12,400
I mean it's very possible that someone 
would take that attitude like,

2041
01:24:12,401 --> 01:24:13,234
look,
I'm not going to tell you most of the 

2042
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:16,240
truth anyway cause it's not in your 
business.

2043
01:24:16,241 --> 01:24:17,074
And it's,
some of it might be classified and some 

2044
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:21,640
of them might be illegal for me to talk 
about,

2045
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:23,770
but maybe I'll make up a bunch of crazy 
shit,

2046
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:24,813
sell some bucks.
Now I'm on the selling me stage of my 

2047
01:24:27,401 --> 01:24:28,020
life.

2048
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:28,540
Yeah.
You know,

2049
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:29,373
and look,
he was probably always doing that to 

2050
01:24:30,901 --> 01:24:31,800
some extent,
you know,

2051
01:24:31,801 --> 01:24:32,840
because you didn't,
you know,

2052
01:24:32,841 --> 01:24:33,674
you don't become the,
the top American sniper unless you 

2053
01:24:36,361 --> 01:24:38,790
already have a preconceived notion of 
yourself as like,

2054
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,980
I'm this bad ass and I'm this great 
warrior.

2055
01:24:40,981 --> 01:24:43,620
And anything you can say to add to that,
you're gonna,

2056
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:44,580
you're gonna say,
well,

2057
01:24:44,581 --> 01:24:47,370
I think maybe more,
maybe you could just be a badass sniper,

2058
01:24:47,371 --> 01:24:48,204
right?
Can you just be just some dude who just 

2059
01:24:49,201 --> 01:24:50,620
excels?
Well,

2060
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,290
I mean,
but you look at his character in this,

2061
01:24:52,291 --> 01:24:54,210
the sort of stories these made up and 
shit,

2062
01:24:54,211 --> 01:24:55,590
and it's obvious that,
you know,

2063
01:24:55,650 --> 01:24:56,483
while he did have actual skills,
he was also fond of embellishing the 

2064
01:24:59,581 --> 01:25:02,790
skills he did have to make himself even 
more legendary.

2065
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:04,800
Yeah.
And why is the question,

2066
01:25:04,801 --> 01:25:07,650
you know,
because there are people that think that

2067
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,990
the horrors of war,
like we talked about,

2068
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:13,140
bend the mind and Ben Perception and 
Ben,

2069
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:13,974
the way you look at reality and in some 
people more severe ways and other 

2070
01:25:16,651 --> 01:25:17,484
people.
Sure.

2071
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:19,043
It's,
uh,

2072
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:19,570
the,
the I,

2073
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:22,380
the,
the request or the,

2074
01:25:22,381 --> 01:25:23,214
the,
the,

2075
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:24,173
the task that we give young people where
they go off to war at fucking 18 years 

2076
01:25:29,401 --> 01:25:30,990
of age and we ship

2077
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:31,853
them off,
get them to shoot people and then 

2078
01:25:33,331 --> 01:25:37,410
comeback and integrate and try to be a 
normal part of society.

2079
01:25:37,411 --> 01:25:41,430
And then with almost no education,
almost no assistance,

2080
01:25:41,431 --> 01:25:42,270
no help.
No,

2081
01:25:42,271 --> 01:25:43,440
no.
Karen them along.

2082
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:44,480
No.
You know,

2083
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:47,520
you mean she'd be looking at them and 
talking to him very carefully.

2084
01:25:47,521 --> 01:25:48,354
You've asked him to do

2085
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,410
crazy thing.
Yeah.

2086
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:50,280
I mean,
especially at the,

2087
01:25:50,281 --> 01:25:50,591
the,
you know,

2088
01:25:50,591 --> 01:25:51,424
like 18 is around the time when I was 
just willing to dump like pancakes on 

2089
01:25:56,221 --> 01:25:58,440
some dude's lap because he fucking,
you know,

2090
01:25:58,530 --> 01:25:59,363
set across thing to me.
So to take people at that age and who 

2091
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:04,910
haven't even really,
I mean,

2092
01:26:04,911 --> 01:26:08,210
I guess they've kind of reached the age 
of reason and stuff,

2093
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:09,710
uh,
in the eyes of society,

2094
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:11,080
but you know,
they're,

2095
01:26:11,081 --> 01:26:14,030
they're not like fully formed adult 
minds yet.

2096
01:26:14,031 --> 01:26:14,864
It's like,
hey,

2097
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:15,973
you're,
you're pretty much still a kid in a lot 

2098
01:26:17,361 --> 01:26:19,820
of ways.
Go overseas and kill some other people's

2099
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:22,730
fucking kids.
Let's just see what happens.

2100
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:23,773
You know,
let's try over there and blow some 

2101
01:26:24,231 --> 01:26:25,011
brains out.
Oh,

2102
01:26:25,011 --> 01:26:26,840
you blew out more brains than anyone 
else.

2103
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:28,370
You're a hero.
You're great.

2104
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:33,650
It's a weird way of looking at it,
but that's,

2105
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,180
that's what it is.
Yeah.

2106
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:36,043
You know,
when you're asking someone to do 

2107
01:26:37,011 --> 01:26:41,180
something before there a certain age,
like you're,

2108
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:45,260
you have a certain amount of authority 
over a 17 year old or an 18 year old.

2109
01:26:45,261 --> 01:26:47,420
When you give them a gun and tell them 
that they're supposed to do it,

2110
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:48,283
they believe they're supposed to do it 
because you're older and you tell them 

2111
01:26:49,831 --> 01:26:50,664
that they're supposed to do it.
So reason why 40 year old guys don't 

2112
01:26:54,321 --> 01:26:58,610
sign up for the army because when a 
guy's 40 might have a family of his own,

2113
01:26:58,611 --> 01:26:59,720
might have a life of,
as long as they're like,

2114
01:26:59,721 --> 01:27:00,260
wait,
what?

2115
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:02,840
Why the fuck are we going over there?
What are these guys done to us?

2116
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:03,710
Hold on,
hold on.

2117
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:06,830
When are we charging a dawn with the 
plan?

2118
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:07,903
Like you're going to ask questions and 
I've going to just trust you at face 

2119
01:27:09,651 --> 01:27:10,730
value and that's no good.

2120
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:12,230
It's terrible.
Well you want,

2121
01:27:12,231 --> 01:27:14,300
when you want soldiers,
you want someone who just listens.

2122
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,760
Yeah.
Who are you listening to though?

2123
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:20,450
Like who were you listening to and why 
you listen to that guy and what,

2124
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:22,140
how'd you get into this situation?
Well,

2125
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:23,960
they don't think about that.
They're fucking 18.

2126
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,620
It's just asking people to go from that 
to regular life.

2127
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:29,780
It's such a bizarre request.
Yeah.

2128
01:27:29,781 --> 01:27:31,610
My stepdad tried to get me to join the 
uh,

2129
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:33,650
the military when I was younger cause 
he's like,

2130
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,900
he saw me and like your life has no 
direction.

2131
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,030
You know what?
You need military.

2132
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:41,510
I thought about doing it.
I didn't really give it much thought.

2133
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:44,450
I went to the recruiting office and let 
them give me a sales pitch.

2134
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:46,640
But yeah,
I'll see you went that far.

2135
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:48,500
I never went into her acuity recruiting 
office.

2136
01:27:48,501 --> 01:27:51,830
Thank God I took a test and they're 
like,

2137
01:27:51,831 --> 01:27:53,170
you could be a,
you know,

2138
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,440
military intelligence.

2139
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:55,903
I'm like,
Eh,

2140
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:58,850
but I heard that a lot of times they 
sucker you in with that.

2141
01:27:58,851 --> 01:28:00,260
Like you're going to be military 
intelligence.

2142
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:01,370
Then if you don't cut it,
they're like,

2143
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,211
well,
you didn't cut it.

2144
01:28:02,211 --> 01:28:03,560
You're a grunt now.
Yeah,

2145
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:06,140
I've heard that.
I've heard that recruiters will bullshit

2146
01:28:06,141 --> 01:28:06,974
you and tell you they're going to get 
you some cool job inside the military 

2147
01:28:09,891 --> 01:28:12,260
and then once you get in there they give
you or fuck the job.

2148
01:28:12,261 --> 01:28:14,000
They were thinking about giving you in 
the first place,

2149
01:28:14,001 --> 01:28:15,080
you know?
Yeah,

2150
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:15,950
yeah.
They don't,

2151
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:18,050
it's not like a college where you,
you know,

2152
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:19,413
yeah,
you get to choose your major and all 

2153
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:21,590
this,
none of that.

2154
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:22,723
No.
They,

2155
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:27,140
they'll decide in many ways it's like 
it's sort of communist in a way,

2156
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:29,120
you know,
you get paid very little.

2157
01:28:29,121 --> 01:28:31,040
He worked very hard.
Everything is for company.

2158
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:31,510
Yeah.

2159
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:32,690
You know,
it's really kind of weird.

2160
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:33,943
Yeah.
Well America has a a strange 

2161
01:28:35,271 --> 01:28:36,104
relationship with that sort of 
collectivism when you think about it 

2162
01:28:38,121 --> 01:28:38,954
that way.
Like it has to probably be that way in 

2163
01:28:40,911 --> 01:28:43,160
order for you to function together.
A soldier's.

2164
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:44,361
Yeah.
I mean,

2165
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:45,194
I don't think you,
I don't think you really want a unit 

2166
01:28:47,571 --> 01:28:49,860
where everyone's constantly questioning 
orders and you know,

2167
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:50,540
like,
no,

2168
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:51,373
I mean,
as much as we kind of placed value on 

2169
01:28:53,331 --> 01:28:53,751
that,
like,

2170
01:28:53,751 --> 01:28:55,340
you know,
it's good to think for yourself and it's

2171
01:28:55,341 --> 01:28:57,870
good to question things.
Um,

2172
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:00,230
if you're trying to be an effective 
military,

2173
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:00,960
it's,
it's,

2174
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,793
that's not what's good.
What's good is you do what your fucking 

2175
01:29:03,241 --> 01:29:04,320
told.
Exactly.

2176
01:29:04,321 --> 01:29:06,870
So that's probably why they use 18 year 
olds to begin with.

2177
01:29:06,871 --> 01:29:08,920
But the problem is,
you know,

2178
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:11,940
even if we're going to accept the 
reality that that's how it has to be,

2179
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:15,780
there has to be more oversight about 
where are we going to send these people?

2180
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:18,930
What reasons have to be in place for us 
to send these people.

2181
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,270
And you know,
we're,

2182
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:21,930
we're still at,
now that we're still in Iraq,

2183
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:25,080
we're still in Afghanistan.
Obama during his presidency,

2184
01:29:25,081 --> 01:29:28,560
bombed a seven countries with drone 
strikes.

2185
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:29,401
Uh,
by the way,

2186
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:30,234
I don't know if you've ever seen the,
the report that like 90% of drone 

2187
01:29:32,551 --> 01:29:34,470
strikes didn't kill their intended 
targets,

2188
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:37,410
90% civilian casualties.
Yeah.

2189
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,340
Uh,
you know,

2190
01:29:38,341 --> 01:29:39,180
so,
uh,

2191
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:40,373
terribly ineffectual.
Like why our country is like spreading 

2192
01:29:43,531 --> 01:29:46,920
bad will across the world,
especially in the Middle East,

2193
01:29:46,921 --> 01:29:49,740
which is like a hotbed of fucking crazy 
fucks anyway.

2194
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:54,090
Just doing it that way in general robots
flying from the sky.

2195
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:55,063
Oh look,
you got,

2196
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:58,710
you gotta make sure those things work.
Like if you're going to just,

2197
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:02,460
you can't be that off where you're 
killing.

2198
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:04,410
I mean it was,
it's in the high 80%,

2199
01:30:04,411 --> 01:30:06,930
wasn't it last time we checked with the,
uh,

2200
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:08,243
the civilian casualty rate was 
unintended casualties for drone strikes 

2201
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:13,523
and you know,
like if you have any weapon that has 

2202
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:17,550
like 10% effectiveness at killing its 
target,

2203
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:19,620
you know,
like that's not a good weapon.

2204
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,140
That's a piece of shit.
It's just w but we're like,

2205
01:30:22,141 --> 01:30:22,620
yeah,
yeah,

2206
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:23,453
but listen,
this way we don't have to send soldiers 

2207
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:26,243
and we just fly it in and we just shoot 
the missiles and we get the fuck out of 

2208
01:30:28,441 --> 01:30:29,070
there.
Yeah,

2209
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:31,740
that's really what I'm saying.
I can see the appeal of that,

2210
01:30:31,741 --> 01:30:32,574
but make sure the technology is there 
and in a way it might be like the most 

2211
01:30:37,471 --> 01:30:39,810
racist way to kill people.
Yeah.

2212
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,140
We're not even willing a whisk at risk 
our own lives to kill you.

2213
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:44,123
We're just going to kill you from afar.
And we were not as concerned about 

2214
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:50,010
killing civilians because no one's,
they're doing it cause we're all the way

2215
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:52,470
in Nevada with a fucking xbox 
controller.

2216
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:54,250
Yeah.
And everyone were killing is just some,

2217
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:56,280
some brown Muslim people.
So it's okay.

2218
01:30:56,370 --> 01:30:57,203
Okay.
Nearly 90% of the people killed in 

2219
01:30:58,621 --> 01:31:00,600
airstrikes were not the intended 
targets,

2220
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:01,170
you know.

2221
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:02,790
And some of these still might have been 
bad people.

2222
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:04,380
I mean they're hanging around with 
fucking,

2223
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:06,420
you know,
or they might have Eris and shit.

2224
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:11,230
Some of them were,
I mean we saw in the Yemen raid a,

2225
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:12,113
the plenty of those victims were kids.
Is there footage of a drone like 

2226
01:31:15,991 --> 01:31:19,260
watching a drone shoot down something is
there,

2227
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:22,500
I want to see what it looks like.
See if you could pull up a video.

2228
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:24,960
Is it from the drones point of view or 
is it,

2229
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,820
it is people seeing the,
usually,

2230
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:29,310
usually you'll see it from the drone 
perspective.

2231
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:32,340
I would like to see what it looks like.
Like a drone launch.

2232
01:31:32,341 --> 01:31:33,570
Something like if you were on the 
ground,

2233
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:36,420
you saw a drone launch,
something in the distance.

2234
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,790
Here we go.
Just,

2235
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:41,190
yeah,
that's what it usually is like.

2236
01:31:41,191 --> 01:31:43,090
So dehumanized,
boom,

2237
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:43,501
boom,
boom,

2238
01:31:43,501 --> 01:31:46,230
boom.
You're dead insane too.

2239
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:47,041
I mean,
the way it just,

2240
01:31:47,041 --> 01:31:50,760
some dudes walking down the street and 
then the Ambo Book,

2241
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:54,360
look at that guy.
He's moved.

2242
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:55,223
Oh my God.
You imagine that just walking down the 

2243
01:31:57,121 --> 01:31:58,650
street due to due to do,
boom.

2244
01:31:58,651 --> 01:32:00,300
You're dead.
Fucking fiery.

2245
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:03,250
Fire ball of death consumes you 
instantly.

2246
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:06,303
Oh Man.
Incinerated off the face of the fucking 

2247
01:32:08,831 --> 01:32:09,850
earth.
Well,

2248
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:13,780
that Wiki leaks one,
the first one.

2249
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:16,000
Yeah.

2250
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,900
Um,
yeah.

2251
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:18,320
You see,
I'm trying to get away and shit.

2252
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:19,183
Collateral murder.
Remember they call it the collateral 

2253
01:32:20,451 --> 01:32:21,030
murder.
Yeah.

2254
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:21,863
Put that video out and you got to see 
like how they're reacting to gutting 

2255
01:32:25,761 --> 01:32:28,490
these people down the street and they 
find out it's the wrong people.

2256
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:30,530
Yeah.
It's like,

2257
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:32,030
whoops.
Yeah.

2258
01:32:32,031 --> 01:32:32,930
Like,
wow.

2259
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:36,320
And that this got out and it shouldn't 
have gotten out.

2260
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:37,623
You know,
that's the,

2261
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,950
that was the big wikileaks rub.
Right.

2262
01:32:39,951 --> 01:32:42,110
They shouldn't have released that.
We shouldn't know.

2263
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:43,213
Yeah.
We shouldn't know when our tax dollars 

2264
01:32:44,511 --> 01:32:45,180
fund,
uh,

2265
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:46,013
the murder of civilians,
the accidental unintended murder of a 

2266
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:52,800
guy with a camera that you thought was a
gun yet.

2267
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:53,780
But when you,
when you,

2268
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:54,613
when you see this statistic that 90% of 
these strikes are killing the wrong 

2269
01:32:56,781 --> 01:32:58,100
people.
I mean,

2270
01:32:59,270 --> 01:32:59,980
you know,
I mean like,

2271
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:03,980
it's happening all the time,
but isn't it crazy how shit their optics

2272
01:33:03,981 --> 01:33:04,814
are that they can't tell the difference 
between a rifle and a camera at 

2273
01:33:08,241 --> 01:33:08,760
distance?

2274
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:09,593
Yeah.
And it's not even just the optics to is 

2275
01:33:10,611 --> 01:33:13,070
just bits is bad intelligence.
Like they'll,

2276
01:33:13,071 --> 01:33:15,020
they'll just,
because they don't have to actually risk

2277
01:33:15,021 --> 01:33:16,370
any troops.
Yeah.

2278
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,690
They'll just be like,
someone says like,

2279
01:33:17,691 --> 01:33:18,890
yeah,
I think he's at this house.

2280
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:19,610
Oh,
okay.

2281
01:33:19,610 --> 01:33:19,971
Boom,
boom,

2282
01:33:19,971 --> 01:33:20,870
boom.
Yeah,

2283
01:33:20,871 --> 01:33:21,501
that's true.
Right.

2284
01:33:21,501 --> 01:33:23,960
If they were on the ground,
they wouldn't treat it that way.

2285
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:26,690
If they were on the ground and we saw 
people on the ground,

2286
01:33:26,691 --> 01:33:29,090
they were walking down the street and 
they saw the photographer with the,

2287
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:30,223
with the camera,
they probably wouldn't treat it and it 

2288
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:32,511
does.
No Way.

2289
01:33:32,511 --> 01:33:33,344
They would just open fire and gun 
everybody down as soon as they saw the 

2290
01:33:35,211 --> 01:33:36,044
people.
Yeah.

2291
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:36,913
So you just,
you just gone everybody down that you 

2292
01:33:38,041 --> 01:33:41,570
run into on your way to the bad guys.
It bad guys.

2293
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:42,471
But when it,
when it's,

2294
01:33:42,471 --> 01:33:44,210
when you have that level of detachment 
where it's like,

2295
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,710
oh,
this is like a fucking video game.

2296
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:46,610
Oops,
I killed some,

2297
01:33:46,611 --> 01:33:47,930
uh,
I killed some civilians.

2298
01:33:47,931 --> 01:33:48,764
Okay,
well the ducks and points from the 

2299
01:33:49,401 --> 01:33:50,090
scoreboard.
Yeah,

2300
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:53,120
because if you were on the ground and 
the same thing happened,

2301
01:33:53,150 --> 01:33:53,983
wouldn't you be judged differently?
Like if you are on the ground and you 

2302
01:33:56,001 --> 01:33:56,834
are moving down the street and you saw a
bunch of people in front of you and one 

2303
01:33:58,551 --> 01:34:01,850
guy had a camera and you just gun them 
all down,

2304
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:03,170
the women,
the kids,

2305
01:34:03,171 --> 01:34:04,290
everybody in front of them.
Yeah.

2306
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:05,270
And you're like,
well,

2307
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:06,133
you know,
hey,

2308
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:07,700
they shouldn't have been out here with 
their kids.

2309
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:09,560
And uh,
I didn't think that was the camera.

2310
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:10,640
Well,
that's essentially,

2311
01:34:10,670 --> 01:34:12,740
is that exactly what the guy said from 
the helicopter,

2312
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:13,603
right?
Yeah,

2313
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:14,503
but it's different.
It's because there's a level of 

2314
01:34:16,581 --> 01:34:18,680
detachment.
There's that wall of separation,

2315
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:20,810
that wall of separation.
It's kind of fucked.

2316
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:21,883
Oh,
it's terrible.

2317
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:24,620
It's scary.
90%.

2318
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:25,723
90.
So let's just keep doing it that way 

2319
01:34:29,391 --> 01:34:30,224
then.
For sure.

2320
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,480
We're going to,
there's nothing we can do about it.

2321
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:33,731
Uh,
look at it.

2322
01:34:33,731 --> 01:34:34,341
This is what I'm,
what I'm,

2323
01:34:34,341 --> 01:34:35,400
when I went,
when I talk about that,

2324
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:36,303
when I talk about this,
when I talk about the collusion between 

2325
01:34:37,791 --> 01:34:38,624
the Democrats and the Republicans,
this is the kind of shit I'm talking 

2326
01:34:39,801 --> 01:34:41,840
about.
This doesn't stop military stuff.

2327
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:42,670
Yeah.
Like,

2328
01:34:42,670 --> 01:34:44,690
yeah,
this stuff doesn't seem to stop.

2329
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:47,270
Whether it's D or R,
right?

2330
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:48,163
This military,
this American Empire that we're trying 

2331
01:34:50,961 --> 01:34:53,450
to maintain across the globe,
that keeps happening.

2332
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:56,750
That's actually a very good point 
because that stays consistent.

2333
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:57,613
And the battle over transgender 
bathrooms take front page of the news 

2334
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:01,483
and then the,
but the war aspect of it stays 

2335
01:35:03,351 --> 01:35:05,870
consistent.
The drone aspects days consistent.

2336
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:10,520
If it doesn't ramp up and it looks like 
it's ramping up a little bit with trump.

2337
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:11,900
Right.
Maybe.

2338
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:13,670
I think that remains to be seen.
Yeah,

2339
01:35:13,671 --> 01:35:14,180
it does.
It,

2340
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:16,640
Obama's been pretty,
Obama Obama was pretty bad about it.

2341
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:18,710
I mean he was extremely violent.
Uh,

2342
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:19,753
drone strikes increased under him.
And that's some of that's just because 

2343
01:35:21,141 --> 01:35:22,820
the technology improved.
Well,

2344
01:35:22,821 --> 01:35:25,370
there's a lot of things about him that 
were so confusing.

2345
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:28,850
The drone strikes is just one of them.
How about the attacks on whistleblowers?

2346
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:29,813
Like whatever happened and what you said
in your shit like yet that hope and 

2347
01:35:33,051 --> 01:35:33,884
change website,
like the whole thing was going to give 

2348
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,250
an offer protection to whistle blowers.
Well,

2349
01:35:37,251 --> 01:35:40,160
you have like one of the biggest whistle
blowers in the history of the world.

2350
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:43,880
Yet the idea of transparency to that was
like a big thing.

2351
01:35:43,881 --> 01:35:45,500
He transparency,
transparency,

2352
01:35:45,501 --> 01:35:46,334
but then you prosecute whistleblowers 
who revealed the gay illegal activities 

2353
01:35:49,491 --> 01:35:51,560
of the government.
That's why when trump was like,

2354
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,480
he wiretapped trump tower.

2355
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,210
I'm like,
so what he wiretapped America,

2356
01:35:56,270 --> 01:36:01,270
the NSA was instill is like just 
gathering everyone's text messages.

2357
01:36:01,971 --> 01:36:02,804
Everyone's phone calls,
archiving that shit in a big server 

2358
01:36:05,421 --> 01:36:07,060
somewhere.
So it hasn't,

2359
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:10,760
how's he walked that back though?
Hasn't he said now that he doesn't think

2360
01:36:10,761 --> 01:36:12,800
that it was a wire tap that it was mike 
something else.

2361
01:36:12,801 --> 01:36:13,634
Yeah,
sure.

2362
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:14,533
But the point is that all the,
all the phones are fucking tapped 

2363
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,130
course.
So what does it matter?

2364
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:21,020
Yeah.
That information is already there.

2365
01:36:21,021 --> 01:36:21,561
And you know,
the,

2366
01:36:21,561 --> 01:36:25,460
the crazy thing is that not only is it 
there for those agencies,

2367
01:36:25,461 --> 01:36:28,790
but it's there for anyone who can hack 
into those agencies to get,

2368
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:33,740
and you know,
if the cio at the,

2369
01:36:33,741 --> 01:36:34,221
the,
the,

2370
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:35,870
uh,
the NSA developed it,

2371
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:37,220
the CIA,
we now know,

2372
01:36:37,221 --> 01:36:40,370
has its own version of it.
I wonder how many private companies have

2373
01:36:40,371 --> 01:36:42,590
their own version of this fucking 
server.

2374
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,480
Yeah.
When we found out that the CIA has their

2375
01:36:44,481 --> 01:36:45,620
own version of it,
everybody was like,

2376
01:36:45,621 --> 01:36:48,650
well,
what them to done,

2377
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:49,820
todd?
Well,

2378
01:36:49,821 --> 01:36:52,580
they're even worse than the NSA.
So how would you know?

2379
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:53,701
Well,
I mean,

2380
01:36:53,701 --> 01:36:54,534
I guess I can't,
I guess I can't say with certainty 

2381
01:36:56,631 --> 01:36:57,464
they're worse,
but the NSA has never been involved as 

2382
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:01,094
far as I know,
in toppling the democratically elected 

2383
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:05,533
leaders of other countries and 
installing puppets that are good for 

2384
01:37:08,181 --> 01:37:11,150
American business interests.
So the CIA has,

2385
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:13,370
yes.
Numerous times.

2386
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:14,550
Yeah.
The,

2387
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:18,430
the idea of them all being able to 
listen to anybody's telephone calls were

2388
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:20,540
regardless of whether or not you're a 
terrorist,

2389
01:37:20,570 --> 01:37:22,700
regardless of whether or not you're a 
felon,

2390
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:25,790
regardless of whether or not he was the 
nicest person of all time,

2391
01:37:25,791 --> 01:37:26,240
they're like,
Yep,

2392
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,320
let me just check.
Yep.

2393
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:28,640
You're still the nicest guy of all time.

2394
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:30,400
And they're using it for,
uh,

2395
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:31,970
I mean,
it's not just being used for terrorism.

2396
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:32,451
Me,
they're using it for,

2397
01:37:32,451 --> 01:37:34,130
there's through their drug war as well.
Yeah.

2398
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,660
Yeah.
Well,

2399
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:36,350
it's,
um,

2400
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:37,183
the drug war is going to have to ramp up
if this marijuana legalization keeps 

2401
01:37:39,531 --> 01:37:41,240
kicking in,
they're going to have to figure out some

2402
01:37:41,241 --> 01:37:44,270
other way to arrest people.
They have to keep the same jobs.

2403
01:37:44,271 --> 01:37:45,470
I mean,
they have a lot of jobs.

2404
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,700
They're going to have to justify,
I mean,

2405
01:37:46,701 --> 01:37:51,701
jeff sessions could come to the pot 
shops like where I live and uh,

2406
01:37:52,821 --> 01:37:54,800
I guess there's pot shops around here 
too and uh,

2407
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:56,250
and they could fucking

2408
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:57,840
read them.
They could shut them down.

2409
01:37:57,990 --> 01:37:59,190
Yeah,
they could legally,

2410
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:00,330
yeah.
They're the,

2411
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:02,490
because it's still illegal under federal
law.

2412
01:38:02,491 --> 01:38:03,324
Obama chose not to do that.
He chose her respect the will of the 

2413
01:38:04,951 --> 01:38:05,784
states,
but the trump administration has at 

2414
01:38:07,231 --> 01:38:11,370
least signaling that it's not going to 
because of sessions.

2415
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:12,293
You think because of a point.
I don't think it's just because of 

2416
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:14,214
sessions.
I think sessions is where he is 

2417
01:38:15,121 --> 01:38:18,030
partially because they want to do this 
crackdown.

2418
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:19,170
Hmm.
That's interesting.

2419
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:22,230
You might be right.
We'll have to find out about that,

2420
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,420
but the crackdown is not going to go 
well.

2421
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,790
It's a terrible idea.
You let the genie out of the bottle,

2422
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:29,100
you gave people their freedom.
That will be the,

2423
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:30,023
that'll be the death of a,
of the power of the trump 

2424
01:38:32,461 --> 01:38:33,294
administration.
If they actually go through with 

2425
01:38:34,201 --> 01:38:37,680
something so stupid.
It would be stupid economically as well.

2426
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:38,970
Oh yeah.
It would show.

2427
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:40,670
I mean,
you want to talk about transparency,

2428
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:41,593
it will show really clearly who your 
loyalty is to that it's not to the will 

2429
01:38:45,781 --> 01:38:46,614
of the people that it's to these 
companies that are benefiting from 

2430
01:38:48,391 --> 01:38:50,130
keeping marijuana illegal.
Period.

2431
01:38:50,131 --> 01:38:50,964
That's it.
And then we'd have to figure out a 

2432
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:53,870
marijuana coalition.
We've,

2433
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:54,843
we've got to figure out a way,
like there are fucking 100 million of 

2434
01:38:58,951 --> 01:39:00,630
us.
I guarantee you in this country,

2435
01:39:00,631 --> 01:39:01,464
100 million people that smoked pot.
That's a lot of fucking people and that 

2436
01:39:04,801 --> 01:39:06,510
number's going to grow a third of the 
country.

2437
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:07,171
It's,
yeah.

2438
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:09,720
And it's going to grow.
The more things are people are

2439
01:39:10,090 --> 01:39:15,000
jubilee room.
Really believe you fucking idiot.

2440
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:16,300
You fucking point.

2441
01:39:18,230 --> 01:39:20,780
There's a lot of fucking people.
I might've made that number up.

2442
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:23,180
I fucking,
uh,

2443
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:24,410
I mean,
I believe it.

2444
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:25,623
I believe it's probably at least close 
because even when I was living down 

2445
01:39:27,891 --> 01:39:30,620
south and I was hanging out with 
conservatives who love trump,

2446
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:32,720
they smoked a little weed,
smoking weed,

2447
01:39:33,070 --> 01:39:34,900
not a little weed.
They're smoking weed like crazy.

2448
01:39:34,901 --> 01:39:36,170
It's fun.
It's fun to get high.

2449
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:37,063
There's nothing wrong with it.
The only thing that's wrong with it is 

2450
01:39:38,031 --> 01:39:40,490
the fact that it's been buttoned down 
into our brain,

2451
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:42,433
deep,
deep in our memory through propaganda 

2452
01:39:44,031 --> 01:39:45,380
that it's bad for you.
That's it.

2453
01:39:45,381 --> 01:39:46,214
Yeah.
If you looked at the actual effects it 

2454
01:39:47,001 --> 01:39:49,100
has on you,
like we were talking about schizophrenia

2455
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:53,480
and blaming marijuana on schizophrenia,
but it still seems across the board it'd

2456
01:39:53,481 --> 01:39:56,510
be 1% it's the same thing with dummies 
and lazy people.

2457
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:58,850
When dummies and lazy people find out 
about pot,

2458
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,450
it ruins the idea of it for other 
people.

2459
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:02,181
Oh,
well look,

2460
01:40:02,181 --> 01:40:03,980
it's associated with his loud mouth 
dummy.

2461
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:05,173
His loud mouth,
fucking lazy person never gets anything 

2462
01:40:06,651 --> 01:40:07,640
done.
He's always broke.

2463
01:40:07,641 --> 01:40:09,350
So I was asking for money.
That's a pothead.

2464
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:11,260
Potheads don't get shit done.
Don't be a pothead.

2465
01:40:11,570 --> 01:40:13,190
And then you get that in your head and 
you're just run with it.

2466
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:14,053
Well,
there's plenty of men.

2467
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:17,170
We know there's plenty of potheads that 
are really industrious and hardworking.

2468
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:18,573
You know a lot of them,
you can't attribute something that was 

2469
01:40:20,721 --> 01:40:22,640
always part of someone's personality and
say,

2470
01:40:22,641 --> 01:40:24,200
well,
marijuana cause that.

2471
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:25,543
Exactly.
It doesn't totally change the nature of 

2472
01:40:27,441 --> 01:40:28,274
a person.
It's not that powerful of a fucking 

2473
01:40:29,781 --> 01:40:31,250
drug.
Nor does coffee.

2474
01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:32,143
No.
Nor does alcohol nor do cigarettes for 

2475
01:40:33,921 --> 01:40:34,930
that matter.
Exactly.

2476
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,070
Well,
alcohol can change some people.

2477
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:38,780
That's true.
It was bad example.

2478
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:42,800
Canada justice system is crumbling as 
cannabis rates continue.

2479
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,320
So,
um,

2480
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:46,333
there've been,
there had been busted all these fucking 

2481
01:40:47,721 --> 01:40:48,470
pot places.

2482
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:53,470
I thought you guys had your social 
justice warrior president and uh,

2483
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:54,483
everybody was going to get to pick their
own gender pronouns and now you're 

2484
01:40:57,281 --> 01:40:58,114
aerating pot places.
Kaloga this 6,500 cases in provincial 

2485
01:41:02,111 --> 01:41:02,944
court could be soon drop due to delays 
including 38 for homicide or attempted 

2486
01:41:06,251 --> 01:41:08,530
murderer.
One terrible case last year,

2487
01:41:08,531 --> 01:41:09,364
a man named Kenneth Williamson was 
convicted of raping a minor over a 

2488
01:41:11,681 --> 01:41:12,514
hundred times.
But because of lengthly delays and 

2489
01:41:14,411 --> 01:41:16,360
taking his truck,
his case to trial,

2490
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,770
his conviction was overturned.
Wait,

2491
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,340
is that so they could prosecute more 
marijuana?

2492
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:24,300
No,
this is just saying that they are there.

2493
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:25,153
They're there.
They're system is in such crisis and 

2494
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:29,403
this marijuana case where they're 
arresting all these people from 

2495
01:41:31,481 --> 01:41:34,900
marijuana,
it's insane because their justice system

2496
01:41:34,901 --> 01:41:37,120
is already in the crisis.
So it says,

2497
01:41:37,121 --> 01:41:37,954
considering the justice system crisis,
cannabis should obviously be the lowest 

2498
01:41:40,271 --> 01:41:43,180
priority for police and the courts,
but it's not,

2499
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:44,103
not only your police launching more 
raids against suspensory than ever 

2500
01:41:46,301 --> 01:41:47,134
before,
but ridiculous charges for small scale 

2501
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:53,470
cannabis crimes are con continuing from 
coast to coast.

2502
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:54,633
So they,
they have a justice system that's so 

2503
01:41:56,051 --> 01:42:01,051
broken that they can't even convict 
people who raped miners a hundred times.

2504
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:04,660
They can't take them to trial.
I mean there is there,

2505
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:05,733
but it's that broken.
But they're still trying to fucking 

2506
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:13,200
catch people for a smoking weed and,
and just a rating dispensary's and Shit.

2507
01:42:13,511 --> 01:42:15,370
Like if I had to get a waste of fucking 
time,

2508
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:16,233
if I had to guess,
I would say it's some sort of 

2509
01:42:17,231 --> 01:42:19,990
compartmentalism and that like the drug 
people aren't,

2510
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:22,740
they don't go after the other crimes and
they don't have to do with it,

2511
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:23,833
you know?
And then there's a legal system that's 

2512
01:42:24,461 --> 01:42:25,294
backed up,
but to put more people into the legal 

2513
01:42:27,371 --> 01:42:28,204
system,
just because you have to somehow or 

2514
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:34,610
another justify the position that you're
in a cop of,

2515
01:42:34,611 --> 01:42:37,150
of a dea cop,
whatever they're called up there,

2516
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:38,680
that's fucking crazy.

2517
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:39,970
You got a broken system.
You have,

2518
01:42:39,971 --> 01:42:40,410
uh,
you're,

2519
01:42:40,410 --> 01:42:42,440
you're preying on people.
You're locking people up.

2520
01:42:42,441 --> 01:42:43,480
Yeah.
You mean if you,

2521
01:42:43,481 --> 01:42:47,590
if you want to impress us then convict 
that fucking a rapist.

2522
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:48,400
Don't,
yeah.

2523
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,233
Don't fucking,
uh,

2524
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:52,000
prosecute people who are smoking weed 
for sure.

2525
01:42:52,001 --> 01:42:54,460
And by the way,
what you're doing right now seems like a

2526
01:42:54,461 --> 01:42:55,090
crime.
You're,

2527
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:59,770
you're locking people up in a cage for a
plant that everybody on the planet knows

2528
01:42:59,771 --> 01:43:00,604
is not bad for you.
So if you just decide that because of 

2529
01:43:03,521 --> 01:43:06,220
some fucking bullshit thing that's 
written on paper,

2530
01:43:06,340 --> 01:43:09,400
that you should be able to go against 
all the science that's available today.

2531
01:43:09,401 --> 01:43:11,830
All the common sense and the will of the
people.

2532
01:43:11,831 --> 01:43:13,600
And you should be able to go into 
people's houses,

2533
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,640
going to people's businesses,
arrest them,

2534
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,380
take all their money,
take all their pot.

2535
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:19,930
That's a crime.
That sounds like a crime.

2536
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:20,763
It sounds like you're using your 
position and you're using it to just 

2537
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:26,850
mark one up on the scoreboard.
You know,

2538
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,230
we got some convictions today.
Good solid ones.

2539
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:30,133
Bunch of dopers caught us.
A bunch of dopers had to let that crazy 

2540
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:37,350
pedophile go,
but we got all the dopay.

2541
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:42,340
It dopers real scourge of society to a 
hundred kids.

2542
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:43,240
But you know what?
He didn't,

2543
01:43:43,270 --> 01:43:45,400
he didn't fuck them over by giving him 
pot.

2544
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:48,200
Yeah.
Casey wasn't smoking no weed.

2545
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:50,860
It's those kids are going to remember 
what he did to them.

2546
01:43:50,861 --> 01:43:52,950
It's not going to damage their memory.
Yeah,

2547
01:43:54,150 --> 01:43:55,970
I remember it.
So you remember it explicitly?

2548
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:58,100
Jesus Christ.
It's just,

2549
01:43:58,101 --> 01:44:02,000
I can't believe that in this day and age
that shit is still going on.

2550
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:04,220
It just seems like,
and Canada,

2551
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:08,900
I thought with this Trudeau guy was 
going to be more progressive than ever,

2552
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:12,260
which Canadians are complaining about it
like crazy and you know,

2553
01:44:12,261 --> 01:44:13,094
I've had Jordan Peterson on the podcast 
and he hates what's going on now with 

2554
01:44:16,101 --> 01:44:16,934
this push towards being as open minded 
as possible with all these accepting of 

2555
01:44:20,781 --> 01:44:24,500
the gender pronouns and that you're 
going to have to start putting people,

2556
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:27,200
uh,
you're going to have to start processing

2557
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:28,034
cases through the human rights council 
because if you don't use a person's 

2558
01:44:31,491 --> 01:44:32,324
proper gender pronoun,
it could literally be considered a 

2559
01:44:33,741 --> 01:44:34,280
crime.

2560
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,970
Like I think all that stuff on the left 
when it goes way far,

2561
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:37,813
it gets really crazy,
but it's probably a good thing to 

2562
01:44:39,531 --> 01:44:40,364
balance out the stuff on the right and 
people figure out some sort of 

2563
01:44:43,161 --> 01:44:45,890
comfortable medium that he's not being 
that at all.

2564
01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:46,963
He's not,
if you,

2565
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:49,700
if the president is allowing this to go 
on,

2566
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:52,580
he's not being this progressive 
president.

2567
01:44:52,581 --> 01:44:53,414
He's just not,
if he's only going to be progressive 

2568
01:44:54,831 --> 01:44:55,664
towards Trans Gender Pronouns and 
whatever other ridiculous laws that 

2569
01:44:59,691 --> 01:45:01,880
they're swamped with.
This is,

2570
01:45:01,881 --> 01:45:04,280
this is just a terrible precedent to 
set.

2571
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:05,263
Allowing them to lock people up for pot 
in 2017 is a fucking criminal waste of 

2572
01:45:10,731 --> 01:45:14,780
resources,
a criminal waste of manpower,

2573
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:15,500
uh,
criminal,

2574
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:16,333
uh,
criminal intrusion on the freedom of 

2575
01:45:18,801 --> 01:45:19,634
those people that you're locking up a 
criminal on the disruption that you're 

2576
01:45:23,241 --> 01:45:26,150
putting into their lives and the money 
that you're taking away from them for,

2577
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,250
for trading out your economy as well.

2578
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:29,083
Yes.
And fucking your economy up and these 

2579
01:45:30,171 --> 01:45:31,004
people were trading in something that is
very valuable to the community and to 

2580
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:36,170
the human beings that consume it.
Yeah.

2581
01:45:36,171 --> 01:45:37,250
You know,
I'm a,

2582
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:41,540
I consider myself probably more liberal 
than I am conservative,

2583
01:45:41,541 --> 01:45:46,541
but when I see the priorities of 
liberals being identity,

2584
01:45:47,211 --> 01:45:48,140
politics,
shit,

2585
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:52,430
gender pronouns and stuff,
and then so much of the real issues like

2586
01:45:52,431 --> 01:45:54,380
just get ignored like this.
Yeah.

2587
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:58,040
Uh,
that makes me hesitant to even say like,

2588
01:45:58,070 --> 01:45:58,903
I'm a liberal or I'm more left wing and 
right wing or whatever because I'm just 

2589
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:03,021
like,
you're,

2590
01:46:03,021 --> 01:46:05,390
your priorities are totally fucked.
They're totally out of order.

2591
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:07,390
Uh,
you know,

2592
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:08,233
apparently in Canada they're fighting 
all these fucking politically correct 

2593
01:46:11,690 --> 01:46:16,310
identity politics battles,
but they can't deal with the pot issue.

2594
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:17,503
They're gonna their police raids against
pot dispensaries are actually up and 

2595
01:46:20,121 --> 01:46:23,720
they're trying to charge people with 
petty fucking weed,

2596
01:46:23,721 --> 01:46:25,100
smoking crimes.

2597
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:27,200
And this is a thing that people always 
go on about.

2598
01:46:27,201 --> 01:46:31,040
Like it's because it's pot,
it seems like it's not a big issue.

2599
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:33,530
It's like it's not,
we've got bigger fish to fry.

2600
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:34,880
Yeah.
When you look at Tj,

2601
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:35,833
okay.
I don't know if you've been paying 

2602
01:46:36,381 --> 01:46:37,760
attention to the stock market.
Okay.

2603
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:39,920
Dj,
you know what the war in Afghanistan,

2604
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:40,520
Tj,
yeah.

2605
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:41,390
Okay,
we've got problems.

2606
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:43,670
Real problems.
I was fucking pop thing.

2607
01:46:43,671 --> 01:46:45,620
You got damn potheads if it's off for 
your pot,

2608
01:46:45,710 --> 01:46:46,510
oh,
what do I do?

2609
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:47,343
Whatever.
But it's not that this what people have 

2610
01:46:49,741 --> 01:46:52,200
to realize,
it's about personal freedom.

2611
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,273
It's about a person telling you what you
can do and enforcing it to the point of 

2612
01:46:57,031 --> 01:46:59,550
putting you in a fucking cage.
And that thing,

2613
01:46:59,551 --> 01:47:00,384
which had been an accepted part of 
civilization for thousands of years and 

2614
01:47:04,831 --> 01:47:07,590
is today accepted.
It's an accepted part of civilization,

2615
01:47:07,770 --> 01:47:09,090
civilization right now.

2616
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:13,110
But there's just these people that don't
engage in it,

2617
01:47:13,111 --> 01:47:13,944
that don't understand it,
and that feel like they have the right 

2618
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:18,540
to go and lock people up for it.
You know,

2619
01:47:18,541 --> 01:47:21,000
when the trump administration started 
signaling that they were going to,

2620
01:47:21,110 --> 01:47:21,943
uh,
take on weed or that they were thinking 

2621
01:47:23,851 --> 01:47:25,860
about it,
at least that it was on the table,

2622
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:29,490
like stupid at that point,
I was,

2623
01:47:29,550 --> 01:47:31,410
I made a video where I was,
I was basically,

2624
01:47:31,411 --> 01:47:33,810
it was like making all the cases why 
this is terrible.

2625
01:47:33,811 --> 01:47:35,850
This is a bad idea.
Uh,

2626
01:47:35,851 --> 01:47:36,570
you know,
the,

2627
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:39,360
I made the economics argument,
I made the personal freedom argument.

2628
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:40,980
Um,
I may,

2629
01:47:40,981 --> 01:47:41,251
I,
you know,

2630
01:47:41,251 --> 01:47:42,084
I pointed out the tremendous amount of 
revenue this is generating for the 

2631
01:47:44,071 --> 01:47:49,071
states that have legalized it.
And a huge part of the response was just

2632
01:47:49,861 --> 01:47:51,540
like,
yeah,

2633
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:52,680
oh yeah,
of course.

2634
01:47:52,681 --> 01:47:56,350
He goes after trump when trump goes 
after his precious weed,

2635
01:47:57,170 --> 01:47:58,260
when he cares.

2636
01:47:58,410 --> 01:48:00,090
That's the only thing that got them to 
care.

2637
01:48:00,091 --> 01:48:00,924
It's like fucking junkie.
I made fucking so many cogent arguments 

2638
01:48:05,851 --> 01:48:06,684
that hold water about the economic and 
personal liberty ramifications of 

2639
01:48:10,141 --> 01:48:10,974
something like this.
And all you want to focus on is my 

2640
01:48:12,811 --> 01:48:16,320
personal usage of this fucking 
substance.

2641
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,330
It's bullshit.
You Bet.

2642
01:48:18,331 --> 01:48:19,164
It's a good thing to talk about cause 
it'll get you talking about it like 

2643
01:48:21,421 --> 01:48:23,100
right now.
It'll get ya.

2644
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:24,103
It'll poke coucher they know because 
they know that people like you and I 

2645
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:30,060
really do enjoy our marijuana.
And when you tried to take away the pot,

2646
01:48:30,061 --> 01:48:31,440
we really do get upset.
Yeah.

2647
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:32,303
I mean it was like kind of the like I 
was kind of like on the give trump a 

2648
01:48:34,441 --> 01:48:37,350
chance bandwagon until they started 
signaling this stuff.

2649
01:48:37,351 --> 01:48:40,110
So that's why it really why I got shit.
It's a very,

2650
01:48:40,111 --> 01:48:40,944
very foolish thing to try to step in in 
2017 with all the signs and all the 

2651
01:48:45,151 --> 01:48:45,984
information and the public opinion and 
to say that marijuana is something that 

2652
01:48:48,721 --> 01:48:51,000
can get you locked up,
get you locked up,

2653
01:48:51,001 --> 01:48:52,320
but it's almost as bad as heroin.

2654
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:55,290
He's so stupid.
That's a silly man.

2655
01:48:55,291 --> 01:48:58,470
That guy needs a pot Brownie more than 
anything in this life.

2656
01:48:58,471 --> 01:49:01,380
He just needs a just a quarter.
Just give them a quarter.

2657
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,393
Let him sit there and let him think 
about his grandchildren and let them 

2658
01:49:04,231 --> 01:49:05,064
think about fishing and let them think 
about just napping in the sun and going 

2659
01:49:08,071 --> 01:49:10,710
to meet the good Lord in a few years.
You don't have much time left,

2660
01:49:10,711 --> 01:49:12,640
motherfucker.
You want to ruin it for potheads.

2661
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,150
You're barely alive.
Your hair's white,

2662
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:18,000
your posture's bad,
and you're standing there lying.

2663
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:21,540
You're lying on television about heroin 
and pot being like really close.

2664
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:24,600
That's a crazy person who doesn't know 
what pot does.

2665
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:25,643
You're talking about pot.
You obviously have no idea what it's 

2666
01:49:27,361 --> 01:49:28,194
like.
It's like a person who's colorblind 

2667
01:49:29,311 --> 01:49:30,144
describing some sort of a kaleidoscope.
You don't know what you're even talking 

2668
01:49:33,181 --> 01:49:35,430
about.
Like for a guy like him,

2669
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:40,880
if you want to have a person who's 
talking about individual experiences,

2670
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:41,933
they should have had,
like if you're talking about someone 

2671
01:49:43,651 --> 01:49:44,484
who's talking about the effects of a 
chemical and whether or not it should 

2672
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:47,613
be,
they should have had some sort of 

2673
01:49:49,751 --> 01:49:51,190
experience with that chemical.

2674
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:53,950
They should know what it's doing.
They should understand it,

2675
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:56,290
especially if it's safe.
Something like marijuana.

2676
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:58,810
So if you to talk about it and to have 
these ridiculous,

2677
01:49:58,811 --> 01:49:59,644
you,
you can't,

2678
01:49:59,950 --> 01:50:03,520
you can invest one evening in a safe 
environment.

2679
01:50:03,521 --> 01:50:05,830
They'll do it in a laboratory or a 
hospital somewhere.

2680
01:50:05,831 --> 01:50:09,160
Pat Up the rooms and give you a pod 
cookie and then put,

2681
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:13,780
put pink Floyd's the wall on just 
someone,

2682
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:16,510
someone tell this fucking guy what it 
really is.

2683
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:18,430
Cause he's just talking out of his ass.
Yeah,

2684
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:19,390
I mean,
uh,

2685
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:21,690
I don't know if this is just apocryphal 
or if they're,

2686
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:22,533
this is an actual story,
but I remember there being something 

2687
01:50:23,921 --> 01:50:26,430
about him saying that he thought the,
the KKK,

2688
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:28,390
we're good guys until he found out they 
smoked weed.

2689
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:29,860
That was,
uh,

2690
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:33,730
I think that was wrongly attributed to 
him and that not only that,

2691
01:50:33,731 --> 01:50:37,990
there has been evidence that he's done 
many things for civil rights.

2692
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:40,120
I had read that too,
but I think that's,

2693
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:41,373
it just might be the case of people 
being overzealous and trying to paint a 

2694
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:46,210
demean.
You could find things,

2695
01:50:46,211 --> 01:50:47,044
I'm sure that you've said or that I've 
started to take them completely out of 

2696
01:50:48,821 --> 01:50:49,654
context.
You could paint a very different 

2697
01:50:50,411 --> 01:50:51,670
opinion.
Definitely.

2698
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:54,850
It's fucking very hard to form an 
opinion of someone,

2699
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:57,430
like a legitimate opinion if someone 
without actually knowing them,

2700
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:58,593
but you can have an opinion.
It's not that hard when they call and 

2701
01:51:01,181 --> 01:51:02,014
say that,
uh,

2702
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:02,993
that pod is nearly as dangerous as 
heroin because then you did that person 

2703
01:51:05,801 --> 01:51:06,634
at that point you're just like,
this person is either delusional or is 

2704
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,450
willfully deceptive.
Right.

2705
01:51:10,451 --> 01:51:13,420
And the important part about it is it's 
not just a person.

2706
01:51:13,421 --> 01:51:15,370
It's a person with an extreme amount of 
power.

2707
01:51:15,490 --> 01:51:16,380
Yeah.
It's a person,

2708
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:19,480
a very dangerous position of enforcing 
laws and you go,

2709
01:51:19,481 --> 01:51:21,670
okay,
well will you think that that's crazy.

2710
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:23,470
That's not true.
That's not true.

2711
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:27,160
Like,
I just drives me nuts because I think it

2712
01:51:27,161 --> 01:51:28,690
helps people.
I really don't.

2713
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:29,583
I really do.
I really do think it's probably one of 

2714
01:51:31,991 --> 01:51:35,680
the best elements in terms of uh,
a happy,

2715
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:39,550
healthy society.
Staying grounded and being like a little

2716
01:51:39,551 --> 01:51:40,630
more kind.
I give,

2717
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:44,380
I think it gives you a certain 
percentage more of kindness.

2718
01:51:44,410 --> 01:51:44,921
Yeah.
I mean,

2719
01:51:44,921 --> 01:51:47,950
uh,
I've definitely seen it make people more

2720
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:50,710
empathetic,
more tolerant towards one another.

2721
01:51:50,711 --> 01:51:53,800
I've seen people who have anxiety that 
it helps.

2722
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:55,083
I've seen people who have anxiety that 
it exacerbates their anxiety to the 

2723
01:51:57,431 --> 01:51:58,630
edibles.
You're sure?

2724
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:01,030
Like with a story I told about my 
brother at the beginning of show,

2725
01:52:01,031 --> 01:52:02,410
but for the,
for the,

2726
01:52:02,411 --> 01:52:03,244
by and large,
I know a lot of people with like bad 

2727
01:52:04,601 --> 01:52:07,090
anxiety who smoke weed and it makes them
feel better.

2728
01:52:07,091 --> 01:52:09,430
It makes them feel more comfortable in 
social situations.

2729
01:52:09,810 --> 01:52:11,160
Um,
stuff like that too,

2730
01:52:11,161 --> 01:52:13,090
bro.
It makes you fucking talk about weed.

2731
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:14,103
Yeah.
How come you guys keep talking about 

2732
01:52:15,131 --> 01:52:15,881
wheat?
I get it.

2733
01:52:15,881 --> 01:52:18,370
You like weed enough already,
Bro.

2734
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:21,790
I can read that.
No could read it in the comments there.

2735
01:52:21,970 --> 01:52:24,660
It's already there.
So much typing and stop talking about.

2736
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:25,780
We get 'em.
I'm going to get,

2737
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:29,170
I know tj reads these motherfucker.
I'm going to get them.

2738
01:52:29,230 --> 01:52:31,660
Don't talk about this.
Talk about this instead.

2739
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:35,080
Suck it.
Feel the burn you motherfucker.

2740
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:36,760
Well,
if you don't want us to talk about weed,

2741
01:52:36,761 --> 01:52:39,040
then tell jeff sessions to stop a 
signaling.

2742
01:52:39,041 --> 01:52:39,874
He's going after it.
Jeff sessions needs to get high on 

2743
01:52:41,561 --> 01:52:42,394
mushrooms to get that guy in a nice room
with Velvet curtains and gentle 

2744
01:52:46,491 --> 01:52:50,660
Jefferson airplane from the 1960s real 
low candlelight.

2745
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:52,910
Put some black light posters on the 
wall.

2746
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:54,090
You don't need that.
You need,

2747
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:55,100
and he's a black light.

2748
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:56,413
I want it to just,
I want him to just sit there and stare 

2749
01:52:58,071 --> 01:53:02,000
at a poster and watch it change shapes 
and colors a bunch of times and like,

2750
01:53:02,001 --> 01:53:02,811
whoa.
Yeah.

2751
01:53:02,811 --> 01:53:04,880
You know what?
We do do black light posters areas,

2752
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:07,520
but only only,
uh,

2753
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:09,620
it's hard to imagine that fucker on 
shrooms.

2754
01:53:09,710 --> 01:53:10,940
No,
it's not easy.

2755
01:53:10,941 --> 01:53:13,600
I see him wearing like an African garb.
Oh.

2756
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:17,090
Like some sort of macrame beads around 
his neck and shit,

2757
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:18,343
but all the posters on the wall,
they're all that Bruce Lee poster from 

2758
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:22,760
enter the dragon with a blood across his
chest.

2759
01:53:24,050 --> 01:53:26,060
That's the greatest velvet poster of all
time.

2760
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:30,590
That's the ultimate trailer Park Kung Fu
master poster.

2761
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:32,270
Oh yeah.
I have that mother fucker up.

2762
01:53:32,271 --> 01:53:35,690
Have him watch that.
Watch all the things that turns into,

2763
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:38,570
yeah,
poor old guy.

2764
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:40,460
It's going to go to his grave without 
trying mushrooms.

2765
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:43,190
It's going to go to his grave thinking 
we'd is as bad as heroin.

2766
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:43,970
Maybe.
Uh,

2767
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:46,550
maybe he took mushrooms and that was the
revelation he had.

2768
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:47,593
Wow.
Marijuana is almost as bad as heroin is 

2769
01:53:50,730 --> 01:53:51,563
so stupid because it doesn't kill you 
and it's actually better for a lot of 

2770
01:53:55,401 --> 01:53:58,910
people for pain than even heroin is.
Especially edible pot.

2771
01:53:59,190 --> 01:54:01,760
Edible pod is supposed to be really good
for people that have chronic pain,

2772
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:04,250
stump,
massive producer of information,

2773
01:54:04,610 --> 01:54:08,690
but you can function on it like it is.
Especially physiologically.

2774
01:54:08,691 --> 01:54:09,524
You can function.
Like if you do something you already 

2775
01:54:10,851 --> 01:54:13,220
know how to do and you're a,
you're high on pot,

2776
01:54:13,221 --> 01:54:16,640
especially edibles.
It doesn't have any like performance,

2777
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:20,340
uh,
like decreasing elements to it.

2778
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:22,550
It doesn't,
doesn't decrease your performance.

2779
01:54:22,551 --> 01:54:23,384
In fact,
a lot of people do it right before they 

2780
01:54:25,071 --> 01:54:28,670
do Jujitsu cause they think it increases
their performance zone.

2781
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:29,523
Where I've known people who get high 
before they go work out because they're 

2782
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:31,641
like,
yeah,

2783
01:54:31,641 --> 01:54:32,474
you know,
it's going to keep me more focused and 

2784
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:34,673
you know,
especially if you're smoking like a 

2785
01:54:35,391 --> 01:54:38,420
strong sativa strain,
it might give him a little energy burst.

2786
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:39,530
Yeah.
You feel it man.

2787
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:41,600
It feels like the fibers of your 
muscles.

2788
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:42,800
It's great.
Before Yoga.

2789
01:54:42,850 --> 01:54:44,090
Oh yeah.
I mean I,

2790
01:54:44,091 --> 01:54:47,390
I don't really do a lot of like physical
activities that much,

2791
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:49,730
but like if I'm going to do like 
stretching or something,

2792
01:54:49,731 --> 01:54:51,750
it's nice to be high and just like,
oh yeah.

2793
01:54:51,830 --> 01:54:55,060
Cause the best your muscles are way more
relaxed and stuff.

2794
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:57,620
You're able to get your,
you have like flexibility.

2795
01:54:57,621 --> 01:54:58,454
You don't really have,
if you're just stone cold sober and all 

2796
01:55:00,261 --> 01:55:03,050
your tension is still there and it feels
really good.

2797
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:04,760
Like when you're stretching,
you're high,

2798
01:55:04,761 --> 01:55:06,650
it feels like,
oh you're supposed to be doing this.

2799
01:55:06,651 --> 01:55:07,484
You should do this more often dude.
Like you just have a better accounting 

2800
01:55:10,491 --> 01:55:12,590
of what the signals your body sending 
you.

2801
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,900
Cause I think when you're,
when you're sober,

2802
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:16,123
you know you can try to think about all 
your different areas and tune into the 

2803
01:55:19,611 --> 01:55:20,444
body and all the various points of 
contact where the elbows meet the 

2804
01:55:24,681 --> 01:55:27,050
forearm and think about all the muscle 
tissue.

2805
01:55:27,051 --> 01:55:27,884
But you'd have to like really go through
it like step by step and be really 

2806
01:55:32,811 --> 01:55:34,940
conscious of what you're doing when you 
smoke pot.

2807
01:55:34,941 --> 01:55:37,390
It's just there.
I really enjoyed watching you fight with

2808
01:55:37,391 --> 01:55:38,224
a steven crowder about this by the way.
Oh he's a silly boy when it comes to 

2809
01:55:41,451 --> 01:55:43,650
pot.
He's a silly boy overall.

2810
01:55:43,651 --> 01:55:44,070
I've had some

2811
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:44,903
dealings with him.
The pop thing is interesting though 

2812
01:55:46,970 --> 01:55:47,803
cause he didn't want to even debate it.
Like when we were pulling up the 

2813
01:55:50,341 --> 01:55:52,980
information he thought it was being a 
bully because we were pulling up things.

2814
01:55:52,981 --> 01:55:56,460
It showed a contrary to what he was 
saying about car accidents.

2815
01:55:56,461 --> 01:56:01,461
I've since looked into it and the 
American Automobile Association has some

2816
01:56:01,921 --> 01:56:05,070
statistics where they think that it's 
increasing.

2817
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:08,460
There's an increased number of people 
that have marijuana in their system,

2818
01:56:08,461 --> 01:56:10,470
but the,
when they have the car accidents.

2819
01:56:10,471 --> 01:56:11,304
But the real problem with that is there 
might be just as much of an increase in 

2820
01:56:14,521 --> 01:56:16,830
those people smoking marijuana in that 
area.

2821
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:17,753
It might not be related to the accident.
Just because it's connected to the 

2822
01:56:20,761 --> 01:56:22,450
accident doesn't mean it caused the 
accident.

2823
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:24,180
Car accident argument too.
Like,

2824
01:56:24,181 --> 01:56:25,014
you know,
you got to realize alcohol is causing 

2825
01:56:26,911 --> 01:56:29,760
way more traffic accidents than,
than weed is.

2826
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:31,290
That was what they were talking about.
There's,

2827
01:56:31,291 --> 01:56:33,300
in these places,
there's a lot of the places where people

2828
01:56:33,301 --> 01:56:35,160
were smoking pot.
There's a decrease,

2829
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:39,870
a decrease in Dui fatalities.
There's a decrease in violent crimes.

2830
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:41,940
There's quite a few different statistics
to look at,

2831
01:56:41,941 --> 01:56:42,774
but Colorado seems to be saying there's 
a decrease in these car accidents and 

2832
01:56:46,681 --> 01:56:47,514
in,
um,

2833
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:49,920
Dui related incidents.
You know,

2834
01:56:49,921 --> 01:56:53,220
Steven crowder wanted to sue me too.
Why do you want to tell you he wanted to

2835
01:56:53,221 --> 01:56:54,510
see me?
We were on the same,

2836
01:56:54,530 --> 01:56:55,363
uh,
network for a while on Youtube and it 

2837
01:56:57,961 --> 01:57:02,460
was called poly pop.
And the guy that was like my assigned,

2838
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:04,380
I forget what the position is called,
the,

2839
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:09,440
the fucking facilitator or whatever the 
fuck he had the same one as I did.

2840
01:57:10,501 --> 01:57:12,540
And he told me,
you know,

2841
01:57:12,541 --> 01:57:14,850
uh,
that video you made about Steven crowder

2842
01:57:15,390 --> 01:57:16,320
and that,
that shit,

2843
01:57:16,321 --> 01:57:19,040
cause he got in a fight with some union 
guy on footage and he was like,

2844
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:21,480
I was attacked by this union thug and I 
punched him.

2845
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:24,390
I looked at the footage and I'm like,
wait a minute,

2846
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:29,400
this guy gets up from the ground.
He's facing away from you.

2847
01:57:29,401 --> 01:57:33,000
It looked like someone pushed him from 
behind because you see the whole video.

2848
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:34,590
Yeah,
the beginning of it.

2849
01:57:34,591 --> 01:57:38,370
The guy threw a punch at him.
Well the guy was on the fucking ground.

2850
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:40,080
Uh,
one point.

2851
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:40,591
Yeah,
like,

2852
01:57:40,591 --> 01:57:41,160
but he's,
he,

2853
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:43,260
you don't really see what happens with 
them when you see,

2854
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:45,120
you see the guy throw a punch at him 
first.

2855
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:46,870
I'm very familiar with the video.
I don't,

2856
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:47,611
I don't know.
I don't,

2857
01:57:47,611 --> 01:57:48,480
I don't,
I looked at it,

2858
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:50,070
I did the guys in his face.
Can we,

2859
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:50,933
can we maybe see the guys in his face?
The guy comes close to him to get into 

2860
01:57:53,731 --> 01:57:57,420
some sort of a grappling situation with 
a guy like physically manhandled them.

2861
01:57:57,590 --> 01:57:58,410
I hold,
hold on.

2862
01:57:58,410 --> 01:57:59,790
This is on crowder's channel.

2863
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:01,450
I want to see the,
there's like an un uh,

2864
01:58:01,590 --> 01:58:03,650
anelle edited version of this somewhere,
but it's,

2865
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:06,750
you could see the full education when it
does happen.

2866
01:58:06,751 --> 01:58:11,160
It's taken even on crowder's channel.
Go scroll ahead a little bit.

2867
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:13,050
I want to get to a,
I'll tell you what,

2868
01:58:13,051 --> 01:58:15,270
that's the guy that's the guy that gets 
the guy that hits him.

2869
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:16,853
Oh wait,
it's the guy's telling him to back the 

2870
01:58:17,821 --> 01:58:19,660
fuck up.
So he puts his hands and hold on that,

2871
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:21,060
that's the guy that fights and right 
there,

2872
01:58:21,061 --> 01:58:21,894
the guy with the mustache,
which guy the mustache did and you see 

2873
01:58:25,650 --> 01:58:26,400
this guy.
Okay.

2874
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,710
You see that?
Like we don't,

2875
01:58:28,770 --> 01:58:30,990
there's like a missing piece of footage 
there,

2876
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:35,220
but in the footage I saw the,
you don't see that guy attack him first.

2877
01:58:35,221 --> 01:58:39,250
You see that guy get up from being on 
the ground on his stomach.

2878
01:58:39,390 --> 01:58:41,070
I see what you're saying.
So something,

2879
01:58:41,190 --> 01:58:44,290
so when I was thinking is through the 
guy that gets steven crowder pushed this

2880
01:58:44,291 --> 01:58:45,340
guy,
I don't know,

2881
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:46,270
cause you don't,
there's no,

2882
01:58:46,271 --> 01:58:47,380
there's no footage on there.
But I,

2883
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:48,273
I surmised based on what I looked at in 
the footage that this guy was maybe 

2884
01:58:51,221 --> 01:58:53,560
pushed and then got up and then started 
wailing on crowder.

2885
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:54,970
Hmm.
Interesting.

2886
01:58:55,050 --> 01:58:57,550
And I put that out there and here's the 
interesting thing.

2887
01:58:57,551 --> 01:59:00,160
He said he was gonna sue me for what I 
said about it.

2888
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,953
Uh,
he then later went to court and a judge 

2889
01:59:04,990 --> 01:59:08,950
looked at the footage and kind of came 
to the same conclusion I did and said,

2890
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:11,860
I don't think that this went down the 
way you're saying based on the footage.

2891
01:59:11,861 --> 01:59:12,694
I see.
He lost that court case and then he had 

2892
01:59:14,621 --> 01:59:18,160
to drop any sort of idea of a lawsuit 
against me because the judge had already

2893
01:59:18,161 --> 01:59:20,050
ruled that the tape was bullshit.

2894
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:21,730
Didn't really show what he thought it 
said shed.

2895
01:59:22,570 --> 01:59:23,403
This is also instances where I 
challenged him to debates back in the 

2896
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:26,950
day,
not recently,

2897
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:28,743
but he would never acknowledge me.
I mean at one time he did send his like 

2898
01:59:31,061 --> 01:59:33,100
little brother after me.
His brother?

2899
01:59:33,130 --> 01:59:33,963
Yeah.
Like I don't know if it was his younger 

2900
01:59:34,511 --> 01:59:35,410
brother,
his older brother,

2901
01:59:35,411 --> 01:59:37,090
I think it was his little brother was 
like,

2902
01:59:37,091 --> 01:59:38,830
you're a fucking faggot or whatever.
I'm like,

2903
01:59:39,070 --> 01:59:41,420
why won't your brother debate me?
Cause we were at the time on the Seine,

2904
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:43,750
that word you're saying he sent them 
after you physically?

2905
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:44,613
No,
no,

2906
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:45,760
just on twitter.
Oh,

2907
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:47,140
okay.
You got to get best five.

2908
01:59:47,141 --> 01:59:47,974
Sorry.
Two dudes are looking at each other 

2909
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:50,590
outside of Barr.
He didn't come.

2910
01:59:50,591 --> 01:59:53,020
He didn't come and try to fucking fuck 
me up or anything.

2911
01:59:53,021 --> 01:59:55,960
He just talking shit on twitter and they
talk shit on twitter.

2912
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:58,530
You're sure that Steven's brother.
It was okay.

2913
01:59:58,600 --> 01:59:59,530
Yeah,
it was steven's brother.

2914
01:59:59,531 --> 02:00:02,230
But um,
but Stephen himself has never taught.

2915
02:00:02,231 --> 02:00:04,930
I made several videos about him.
Maybe not several like three.

2916
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:06,670
Mm.
Uh,

2917
02:00:06,671 --> 02:00:07,504
but he's never confronted me.
Polyprop tried to get us to do a debate 

2918
02:00:11,381 --> 02:00:12,214
at the time he wouldn't do it.
That seems when it's weird because like 

2919
02:00:14,651 --> 02:00:17,050
he's mister like,
I'm going to go like,

2920
02:00:17,051 --> 02:00:19,180
he just trolled Janky yogurt the other 
day,

2921
02:00:19,181 --> 02:00:19,781
you know,
it was,

2922
02:00:19,781 --> 02:00:21,100
I thought that was funny.
His,

2923
02:00:21,101 --> 02:00:23,230
his impression of Janky Yoga is fucking 
fun.

2924
02:00:23,231 --> 02:00:25,930
It is pretty spot on.
The one that he did where he played Anna

2925
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:28,060
and junk back and forth.
I didn't see that.

2926
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:29,380
Oh fuck it.
Pull it up.

2927
02:00:29,410 --> 02:00:32,080
He'll let us use it.
But I like Steven crowder.

2928
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:33,340
I do.
I really do.

2929
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:35,080
I think he's a good guy.
I just,

2930
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:35,860
you know,
he's like,

2931
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:37,960
he's a little bit heavy on the right 
wing.

2932
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:41,080
He gets a little silly,
but he does some funny shit like this.

2933
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:44,350
And when he crashed genx thing,
like with this,

2934
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:46,690
the saddest thing was how Jank was 
responding to it.

2935
02:00:46,691 --> 02:00:47,524
Like he,
he didn't have any sense of humor about 

2936
02:00:48,761 --> 02:00:50,130
it.
Uh,

2937
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:52,670
well Jank obviously takes himself very 
seriously for some reason.

2938
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:58,530
Do the research.
That's absolutely correct.

2939
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:03,510
You will have it listed a Goc I agree 
with you.

2940
02:01:03,511 --> 02:01:07,620
Cenk so much.
That's absolutely right.

2941
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:09,060
When you use the f word,
you know,

2942
02:01:09,061 --> 02:01:12,600
it's real time.
So we have a bunch of people anyway.

2943
02:01:12,820 --> 02:01:15,880
You could see it online at one point.
He's porn bacon,

2944
02:01:15,881 --> 02:01:18,040
grease down his mouth.
I just thought it was funny.

2945
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:19,350
It was pretty fine.
It's,

2946
02:01:19,410 --> 02:01:20,350
it's,
look,

2947
02:01:20,410 --> 02:01:21,243
dude,
I reached out to be able to make fun of 

2948
02:01:22,151 --> 02:01:24,010
yourself.
I recently sat down,

2949
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:25,930
uh,
we did this.

2950
02:01:26,350 --> 02:01:27,183
We went and watched a bunch of young 
Turks videos so we could put out this 

2951
02:01:30,041 --> 02:01:32,950
special drunken peasants versus the 
young Turks.

2952
02:01:33,690 --> 02:01:35,370
A video.
We,

2953
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:39,410
we shot about five hours of us watching 
young Turks videos and just tearing them

2954
02:01:39,411 --> 02:01:39,980
apart.
And one

2955
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:44,360
of the things I noticed is what Jank 
we'll do [inaudible] and watch for this.

2956
02:01:44,361 --> 02:01:46,700
If you ever watch an his shit,
uh,

2957
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:51,710
he'll have his panel say something 
that's like super crazy left wing.

2958
02:01:52,190 --> 02:01:53,660
Like someone will say it,
like animal,

2959
02:01:53,661 --> 02:01:55,520
say it or one of the Steven O or 
whatever.

2960
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:57,980
Whoever got on Ben,
make a wits,

2961
02:01:58,040 --> 02:01:58,873
whatever.
They'll say something that's real far 

2962
02:02:00,501 --> 02:02:04,550
left wing and then it'll cut to Janke 
and Jank.

2963
02:02:04,551 --> 02:02:05,384
We'll have more of like a,
a moderate left wing opinion and then 

2964
02:02:08,991 --> 02:02:12,230
it'll go back to them and they'll 
immediately capitulate to Jank like,

2965
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:14,030
oh yeah,
Jank you're,

2966
02:02:14,031 --> 02:02:14,571
you're,
you're,

2967
02:02:14,571 --> 02:02:17,150
what you're saying is way more sensible 
than what I said a second ago.

2968
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:20,000
And I just saw that pattern recurring 
over and over and over again.

2969
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:23,090
So I don't know if that's like by design
or if they're just,

2970
02:02:23,091 --> 02:02:23,924
they feel like the need to capitulate to
him because there they'd be scared of 

2971
02:02:26,421 --> 02:02:27,590
him or something,
you know,

2972
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:28,663
or uh,
or what it was definitely a lot of 

2973
02:02:30,261 --> 02:02:30,810
emotion.

2974
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:34,350
What's going on there too.
There's a lot of emotion in the way they

2975
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:38,550
describe things and some people I think 
at least initially connected to that,

2976
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:41,040
but then they see where it gets 
problematic.

2977
02:02:41,041 --> 02:02:41,874
If you're dealing with any like really 
serious issue and you want to debate 

2978
02:02:44,851 --> 02:02:46,980
just the facts like and have your ducks 
in a row,

2979
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:47,873
the wool,
the wool over my eyes was the Harris 

2980
02:02:49,801 --> 02:02:51,930
debate because think most people,
exactly.

2981
02:02:51,931 --> 02:02:55,870
That was like the first like major chink
in the chank ugur armor.

2982
02:02:57,370 --> 02:02:58,880
I never know how to pronounce his first 
name.

2983
02:02:58,881 --> 02:03:00,780
So when you said it that way,
I was like you,

2984
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:01,743
you kind of think it's been changing 
Cenk in the Jank you've Cenk in the 

2985
02:03:04,671 --> 02:03:05,720
Jank.
Yeah,

2986
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:07,340
there we go.
I think he's a good guy.

2987
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:12,200
I liked talking to him too.
I just think people handle certain types

2988
02:03:12,201 --> 02:03:14,790
of confrontation and disagreements.
Um,

2989
02:03:14,870 --> 02:03:16,970
and they don't handle the best way they 
could.

2990
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:21,260
And then those things escalate and they 
compound and then it becomes who you are

2991
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:22,183
and then you defending who you are and 
then you're always trying to argue with 

2992
02:03:24,741 --> 02:03:26,600
people about who you are and what you've
done.

2993
02:03:26,601 --> 02:03:28,150
And like that's when you're gone.
Yeah.

2994
02:03:28,270 --> 02:03:30,230
It's when you're over the top,
it's like we've done that,

2995
02:03:30,260 --> 02:03:32,450
we've done that and we've done this,
we've done that.

2996
02:03:32,451 --> 02:03:33,680
Like,
Hey,

2997
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:36,320
you're talking about shit that's 
happening in the world.

2998
02:03:36,350 --> 02:03:38,690
That's all you're doing.
That's all any of us are doing.

2999
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:42,500
That's all anybody's doing it.
Unless you're out there digging wells in

3000
02:03:42,501 --> 02:03:43,334
the Congo with Justin wren,
what you're doing is you're talking 

3001
02:03:46,011 --> 02:03:46,844
about shit.
So if you got a bunch of people 

3002
02:03:48,381 --> 02:03:51,380
listening to you talk about shit,
it's just talking about shit.

3003
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:52,393
The end of the day you don't get any 
extra points because more people are 

3004
02:03:55,371 --> 02:03:59,120
listening or more people are watching.
Your point isn't more valid.

3005
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:02,420
Your point still has to stand up in the 
marketplace of ideas.

3006
02:04:02,430 --> 02:04:03,263
Yeah.
And yours is just as valid as his is 

3007
02:04:05,301 --> 02:04:07,300
just as valid as mine.
It just,

3008
02:04:07,301 --> 02:04:09,410
if the delivery system is a bigger 
delivery system,

3009
02:04:09,411 --> 02:04:12,080
it doesn't mean that like everybody has 
to stop.

3010
02:04:12,710 --> 02:04:15,860
I'd take you into account because you've
had more success in this market.

3011
02:04:16,390 --> 02:04:19,070
That's a crazy way of looking at shit.
Sure.

3012
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:20,413
And when him and Alex Jones battle back 
and forth between who gets the most 

3013
02:04:24,141 --> 02:04:26,540
viewers and who has the model like,
Holy Shit,

3014
02:04:26,541 --> 02:04:28,600
this is ridiculous.
Like what,

3015
02:04:29,210 --> 02:04:32,330
when did you see when Alex went onto the
stage at south by southwest?

3016
02:04:32,331 --> 02:04:34,310
Is that what it was south by southwest?
I think so,

3017
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:35,200
yeah.
Last year.

3018
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,680
It's hilarious.
Oh yeah.

3019
02:04:36,681 --> 02:04:37,770
That was the,
was one of the greatest,

3020
02:04:37,810 --> 02:04:38,360
uh,

3021
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:39,990
uh,
trollings of all time.

3022
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:41,820
But it,
jen got so mad.

3023
02:04:41,970 --> 02:04:44,820
I was furious.
And then dumb ass that little,

3024
02:04:44,821 --> 02:04:47,250
they oppose Saudi Arabia,
little weasel,

3025
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:52,480
Jimmy Dore spitting on that.
So unfortunately Alex Jones did.

3026
02:04:52,770 --> 02:04:53,603
You know,
it's unfortunate that Guy Jimmy Dore 

3027
02:04:54,451 --> 02:04:55,480
does some good stuff.
Yeah,

3028
02:04:55,550 --> 02:04:58,560
I've seen some of his stuff too.
This is a really good to put some really

3029
02:04:58,561 --> 02:04:59,530
good videos up.
He,

3030
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:01,200
he's done some really good work.
Yeah.

3031
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:04,560
I can't keep them.
I don't really care for him.

3032
02:05:04,650 --> 02:05:05,610
But um,
but,

3033
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:07,350
but you recognize that some of this 
stuff's really good,

3034
02:05:07,351 --> 02:05:09,570
right?
I've never seen this stuff.

3035
02:05:09,571 --> 02:05:10,404
That's good.
And maybe,

3036
02:05:10,530 --> 02:05:11,700
maybe,
maybe it's out there.

3037
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:14,070
I haven't seen it.
I've seen it makes some good points.

3038
02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:15,740
Very good points.
Uh,

3039
02:05:15,930 --> 02:05:17,580
you know,
he,

3040
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:19,260
when he was covering the whole Milo 
thing,

3041
02:05:19,261 --> 02:05:20,094
he played a very deceptive version of 
the Milo clip and he credited us 

3042
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:25,880
basically as a podcast.

3043
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:30,240
And one that's talked about us is like,
we're doing this podcast from a basement

3044
02:05:30,241 --> 02:05:31,950
somewhere or something.
Meanwhile,

3045
02:05:31,951 --> 02:05:34,110
isn't it funny that a podcast like 
yours,

3046
02:05:34,111 --> 02:05:35,910
which gets hundreds of thousands of 
downloads,

3047
02:05:35,911 --> 02:05:36,744
I'm sure,
right?

3048
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:39,990
Like you,
if it was more than that,

3049
02:05:39,991 --> 02:05:41,460
he would have to say the name of the 
podcast.

3050
02:05:41,461 --> 02:05:42,130
Right.
Like if he was,

3051
02:05:42,130 --> 02:05:45,390
he was on the Adam Carolla show,
he would say the Adam Carolla show.

3052
02:05:45,570 --> 02:05:46,890
Sure.
Cause it's yours.

3053
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:47,783
Even though he knows what it's like,
like I'm not going to give these guys 

3054
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:50,200
now.
And you know,

3055
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:51,810
a lot of the media did that to us.
I was,

3056
02:05:51,811 --> 02:05:52,644
I was a,
there was like transcripts of the Milo 

3057
02:05:54,571 --> 02:05:59,250
episode where it was like,
and then unknown host said this,

3058
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:00,330
it's like,
fuck you,

3059
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:04,800
I'm not in a bunker whites.
You guys can't just look it up.

3060
02:06:05,250 --> 02:06:07,050
Aren't you supposed to be like 
journalists?

3061
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:09,780
Can't you figure out what the fuck the 
podcast was?

3062
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:12,750
And I saw ones that attributed,
um,

3063
02:06:12,870 --> 02:06:13,703
stuff to me,
but then had stuff of yours where they 

3064
02:06:17,761 --> 02:06:19,890
didn't even,
I didn't even know that you guys had him

3065
02:06:19,891 --> 02:06:20,724
on.
I thought that all the shit was coming 

3066
02:06:21,901 --> 02:06:22,734
from my podcast because I got a text 
message from my friend Chris Mcguire 

3067
02:06:25,951 --> 02:06:28,770
informing me of all of it.
And so I went and I said,

3068
02:06:28,771 --> 02:06:30,210
well,
this isn't even my podcast.

3069
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:31,860
And then I realized like,
oh,

3070
02:06:31,861 --> 02:06:32,694
he was on your podcast too.
And they combined the two different 

3071
02:06:35,251 --> 02:06:36,480
things.
I even saw people say like,

3072
02:06:36,481 --> 02:06:40,190
he was on Joe Rogan's drunken peasants 
podcast.

3073
02:06:40,191 --> 02:06:42,060
It's like,
wow,

3074
02:06:42,061 --> 02:06:44,580
people are supposed to trust you for 
fucking information.

3075
02:06:44,581 --> 02:06:46,710
You're supposed to be a fucking credible
source.

3076
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:49,380
You can't even get this basic shit.
Right.

3077
02:06:49,381 --> 02:06:51,690
So the media is a fucking joke.
Well,

3078
02:06:51,691 --> 02:06:54,370
the media now is,
it's total fucking joke.

3079
02:06:54,371 --> 02:06:56,400
He's like a few places we could still 
trust.

3080
02:06:56,550 --> 02:06:57,980
Like where?
Um,

3081
02:06:57,981 --> 02:07:00,780
I'm hoping you were on the answer 
because you know what?

3082
02:07:00,781 --> 02:07:02,370
People come to me all the time and 
they're like,

3083
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:05,280
Tj,
what news media outlet do you trust?

3084
02:07:05,281 --> 02:07:06,120
I'm like,
none of them.

3085
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:08,550
I don't trust a single God damn fucking 
thing.

3086
02:07:08,551 --> 02:07:11,430
Any of these institutions have to say 
whatever Megan Kelly has to say.

3087
02:07:11,431 --> 02:07:12,850
I'm listening.
I'm Megan,

3088
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:14,460
I'm in.
Hey again.

3089
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:15,700
You're right about everything,
man.

3090
02:07:15,780 --> 02:07:16,800
It a lot.
That's what I like.

3091
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:19,210
Like ice princesses.
Yeah.

3092
02:07:19,211 --> 02:07:22,770
I don't know why.
Like a main like Amina and smart,

3093
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:23,933
really?

3094
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:27,390
Not really.
No.

3095
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:28,740
I'm like,
no,

3096
02:07:28,741 --> 02:07:31,470
but I'm fascinated by people who must,
you know,

3097
02:07:31,471 --> 02:07:32,450
some people,
you know,

3098
02:07:32,610 --> 02:07:35,190
they're perfect structure,
perfect bone structure,

3099
02:07:35,290 --> 02:07:37,600
steely blue eyes and peck will be 
dressed,

3100
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:42,820
talking about guns and the war and crime
and poverty and pot and prison.

3101
02:07:42,970 --> 02:07:43,803
We'll be right back.
You know the fucking bitch I really 

3102
02:07:45,041 --> 02:07:48,310
hated back in the day was a nancy grace.
Oh,

3103
02:07:48,311 --> 02:07:49,390
she's the worst.
She's hideous.

3104
02:07:49,391 --> 02:07:51,340
Stole the worst.
She's horrible.

3105
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:54,910
And like that,
that moral indignation that she has over

3106
02:07:54,911 --> 02:07:56,380
everything.
Like everything is always like,

3107
02:07:56,890 --> 02:07:58,100
yeah,
oh my God,

3108
02:07:58,420 --> 02:08:00,340
I cannot believe.
You know.

3109
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:02,560
I hate that.
I hope that constant,

3110
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:03,453
I'm indignant about everything in the 
world and I'm this great moral judge 

3111
02:08:06,311 --> 02:08:07,144
here to fucking tell people what's 
really what another dead baby in 

3112
02:08:10,781 --> 02:08:14,410
Florida.
Oh,

3113
02:08:14,411 --> 02:08:15,244
she's a monster.
Remember when she went up to those Duke 

3114
02:08:16,511 --> 02:08:17,700
Lacrosse kids?
Yep.

3115
02:08:18,130 --> 02:08:21,100
The fake rape case and then never 
apologized.

3116
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:23,230
Now why would she?
She's perfect.

3117
02:08:23,290 --> 02:08:24,123
In fact,
she's probably still thinks those kids 

3118
02:08:25,061 --> 02:08:27,670
did it.
Imagine that.

3119
02:08:28,390 --> 02:08:30,000
Imagine,
imagine being those kids and go home.

3120
02:08:30,001 --> 02:08:32,890
What in the fuck we didn't do that.
Oh,

3121
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:34,420
Nancy grace.
Show up.

3122
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:36,670
Nancy grace.
That's not the truth.

3123
02:08:36,970 --> 02:08:41,970
Those boys are terrible.
She's made her entire career off of like

3124
02:08:45,310 --> 02:08:46,143
exploiting the worst human beings and 
their worst case scenarios and then 

3125
02:08:50,471 --> 02:08:52,690
putting it on tv and getting everybody 
outraged.

3126
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:55,720
Yup.
[inaudible] machine hot mom.

3127
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:59,230
She was the one who was chasing that 
lady down that killed her kid.

3128
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:00,430
Casey Anthony.
Remember that?

3129
02:09:00,460 --> 02:09:02,380
That was,
that was her big bloodhound moment.

3130
02:09:02,381 --> 02:09:06,940
Nancy Grace Review renews her criticism 
of Taught Mom.

3131
02:09:07,180 --> 02:09:12,070
Who the fuck is Tottenham renewing?
She's that lady that killed her kid.

3132
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:12,993
Oh,
okay.

3133
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:15,090
Yeah.
Oh,

3134
02:09:15,090 --> 02:09:17,290
so it's Casey and Casey Anthony.
I didn't,

3135
02:09:17,291 --> 02:09:18,910
I've never heard her called tot mom 
before.

3136
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:22,600
Yeah,
that's who she calls her or taught mom.

3137
02:09:22,601 --> 02:09:25,810
I tried to avoid experiencing Nancy 
grace on any level.

3138
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:27,910
Did you ever see her debate with two 
chains?

3139
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:31,780
Now they debated about pot,
two chainz and Nancy grace.

3140
02:09:31,781 --> 02:09:34,690
We're debating about pod on TV.
It was the most ridiculous shit ever.

3141
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:36,640
Two chains and that have actually seen 
that.

3142
02:09:36,641 --> 02:09:38,390
Now that you mention it,
why?

3143
02:09:39,310 --> 02:09:41,860
Why they let two Chainz do it?
Cause she probably thought he was a soft

3144
02:09:41,861 --> 02:09:44,350
target that she could just row 
steamrolled in.

3145
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:46,990
Oh yeah.
If you're going to do that with her,

3146
02:09:46,991 --> 02:09:49,180
you'd need to be in the room too.
You can't be on that split screen.

3147
02:09:49,181 --> 02:09:51,470
They talk over.
You could barely hear them.

3148
02:09:51,510 --> 02:09:52,960
This delay,
it's confusing.

3149
02:09:53,170 --> 02:09:54,940
They know what the fuck they're doing.
They'll split,

3150
02:09:54,941 --> 02:09:56,020
scream.
Things are weird.

3151
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:58,270
You have something in your ear and 
they're talking to them.

3152
02:09:58,280 --> 02:09:58,960
You don't see them.

3153
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,760
You're staring right at camera,
dude.

3154
02:10:00,761 --> 02:10:01,141
Yeah.
Don't,

3155
02:10:01,141 --> 02:10:02,950
when I wasn't looking at them and I was 
on CNN,

3156
02:10:03,250 --> 02:10:04,083
like not only that,
but like I was in a huge gigantic room 

3157
02:10:07,630 --> 02:10:08,463
and the camera was like 30 feet away,
so I'm looking at this camera that's 

3158
02:10:12,161 --> 02:10:14,700
like in the distance,
like talking and nothing it,

3159
02:10:14,770 --> 02:10:19,770
there's a fucking earpiece in my ear 
that keeps falling out and it's designed

3160
02:10:20,201 --> 02:10:21,034
that way,
man.

3161
02:10:21,130 --> 02:10:23,140
It's designed to,
well,

3162
02:10:23,141 --> 02:10:25,780
first of all for convenience for them,
for the people that are filming.

3163
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:29,350
Yeah,
but also like the best way to get a good

3164
02:10:29,351 --> 02:10:30,184
reaction out of a,
the guest is put the guests under 

3165
02:10:31,991 --> 02:10:34,100
pressure,
put them on a press button and then some

3166
02:10:34,101 --> 02:10:34,934
weird situation and have some smooth 
talking cukor Tucker Carlson type 

3167
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:38,810
character.
Oh Dude.

3168
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:39,933
Tucker Tucker,
I'm really disappointed he didn't stick 

3169
02:10:42,201 --> 02:10:44,450
with the bow tie.
I was hoping I am too,

3170
02:10:44,451 --> 02:10:44,950
but you know what?

3171
02:10:44,950 --> 02:10:48,990
He seems like his ratings or better.
So maybe the bow tie this fucking lot.

3172
02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:49,843
But like I remember like,
I love how every fucking answer anyone 

3173
02:10:52,281 --> 02:10:54,440
gives to him on his show.
He always does this like,

3174
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:56,460
yeah.
Hmm.

3175
02:10:56,570 --> 02:10:58,040
Yeah,
yeah.

3176
02:10:59,090 --> 02:11:01,160
Always has this like perplexed.
Like what,

3177
02:11:01,490 --> 02:11:03,770
yeah,
he's an interesting guy.

3178
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:08,120
He's sort of taking this middleman 
republican approach,

3179
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:10,460
sort of the middle,
you know,

3180
02:11:10,461 --> 02:11:11,294
like more reasonable,
more and more towards the middle will 

3181
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:14,960
be,
can I understand your position?

3182
02:11:14,961 --> 02:11:15,590
Like,
let me,

3183
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:17,390
let me go over your position one more 
time please.

3184
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:18,553
Like he's,
he's,

3185
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:22,010
he's sort of semi mocking,
but clearly on the right.

3186
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:22,970
Oh yeah.
And uh,

3187
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,610
the,
the great thing too is that he's kind of

3188
02:11:25,611 --> 02:11:27,020
brought that,
um,

3189
02:11:27,230 --> 02:11:31,700
that Internet strain of conservatism 
over to Fox News.

3190
02:11:31,701 --> 02:11:32,534
Cause like,
you know,

3191
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:35,930
Bill O'reilly and Sean Hannity,
they're not tapped into that shit.

3192
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:36,800
Right,
right.

3193
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:38,090
Bill Tucker is,
yeah.

3194
02:11:38,091 --> 02:11:39,070
And it's clear.
Right,

3195
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:39,913
right,
right.

3196
02:11:39,950 --> 02:11:40,671
So He's,
he's,

3197
02:11:40,671 --> 02:11:42,770
he's basically appealing to,
uh,

3198
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:44,840
probably a younger conservative 
demographic.

3199
02:11:44,841 --> 02:11:48,350
I would imagine than than Hannity and a 
o'reilly get,

3200
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:49,273
he's appealing to the people that have 
seen one too many Alex Jones videos 

3201
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:55,160
where they've gotten to that one point 
that like,

3202
02:11:55,161 --> 02:11:57,260
I can't do this anymore.
I can't do this anymore.

3203
02:11:57,860 --> 02:12:01,050
And then they go over to Tucker.
So what was it,

3204
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:04,250
what was it like having him having him 
on here by the way,

3205
02:12:04,370 --> 02:12:06,350
Alex Jones,
it was a dream come true.

3206
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:09,290
Like sit and face to face and listen to 
him talk.

3207
02:12:09,410 --> 02:12:10,243
Well,
I've been friends with them for a long 

3208
02:12:10,641 --> 02:12:11,474
time,
right on that guy since 1999 I think it 

3209
02:12:14,601 --> 02:12:16,250
was fun.
It was fun for me,

3210
02:12:16,251 --> 02:12:17,084
but it was also something like for the 
longest time people thought I was 

3211
02:12:19,431 --> 02:12:22,070
avoiding having him on for some reason 
and he kept saying,

3212
02:12:22,130 --> 02:12:22,963
well,
I tried to get ahold of Joe Rogan every 

3213
02:12:24,030 --> 02:12:24,650
month,
Tom and Tom,

3214
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:25,520
but he blows me off.

3215
02:12:26,090 --> 02:12:28,730
He was always texting the wrong number.
He's always like,

3216
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:31,010
he didn't get worried.
Get Ahold of me that day.

3217
02:12:31,011 --> 02:12:31,491
And I'm like,
dude,

3218
02:12:31,491 --> 02:12:33,650
I already have a podcast schedule.
I can't do it today.

3219
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:35,090
Well,
I'll be back soon.

3220
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:36,350
One of my bag.
We'll figure it out.

3221
02:12:36,351 --> 02:12:37,490
We'll figure it out.
And then he would go on.

3222
02:12:37,491 --> 02:12:41,600
I show Joe Rogan's been avoiding me.
I've been trying to get in there to give

3223
02:12:41,601 --> 02:12:45,590
out this information is very important.
Maybe scared,

3224
02:12:45,591 --> 02:12:47,780
maybe he's been threatened.
The government threatened him.

3225
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:49,093
He won't open up about bigfoot.
I believe Joe Rogan did experience big 

3226
02:12:52,361 --> 02:12:54,770
foot.
He saw he was there in the woods.

3227
02:12:55,390 --> 02:12:56,840
Now Alex doesn't really believe in big 
foot.

3228
02:12:56,841 --> 02:12:59,770
I guess.
Who knows what he's got fries.

3229
02:13:00,770 --> 02:13:01,603
I know he believed.
He seems to believe in demons these 

3230
02:13:03,380 --> 02:13:03,771
days.
Oh yeah.

3231
02:13:03,771 --> 02:13:06,080
Well they are demons.
They're all,

3232
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:08,240
they're all demons from hell.
All of them.

3233
02:13:08,241 --> 02:13:09,620
They're damned.
They're damned.

3234
02:13:09,650 --> 02:13:10,483
I'm sorry.
And if you see red thing where he 

3235
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:11,990
doesn't eat,
you apologize.

3236
02:13:12,290 --> 02:13:14,690
The apology,
the apology compilation.

3237
02:13:14,990 --> 02:13:17,090
Excuse me.
It's amazing.

3238
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:19,880
I will stop your head.
Excuse me.

3239
02:13:19,881 --> 02:13:21,920
I've got to,
that's just a Christian family show.

3240
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:22,961
It's like,
what the hell?

3241
02:13:22,961 --> 02:13:23,794
I am a Christian and I apologize.
He's just such a fucking awesome guy to 

3242
02:13:27,471 --> 02:13:28,304
me.
He's awesome.

3243
02:13:28,670 --> 02:13:29,503
He's,
he's like a boundless source of 

3244
02:13:30,381 --> 02:13:32,070
entertainment.
And if you knew

3245
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:32,491
him,
man,

3246
02:13:32,491 --> 02:13:34,440
like if you,
me and him went out,

3247
02:13:34,441 --> 02:13:35,970
we went to a bar,
we had a couple of drinks,

3248
02:13:36,090 --> 02:13:38,130
we would have a great fucking time.
I'm telling you,

3249
02:13:38,131 --> 02:13:40,440
he's a really nice guy.
He's a real nice guy.

3250
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:41,690
And he would start telling you,
well,

3251
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:42,533
the Barium,
they'd been putting bury him in the 

3252
02:13:43,351 --> 02:13:44,220
water and you're like,
what?

3253
02:13:44,410 --> 02:13:46,680
You want another beer?
Like it's,

3254
02:13:47,170 --> 02:13:49,440
it's,
I'm telling you he's a great guy,

3255
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:50,333
but I understand that people are upset 
that he has the president's ear and 

3256
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:53,933
maybe the president is like me.
Maybe the president just thinks he's 

3257
02:13:55,291 --> 02:13:57,390
awesome.
Listen to crazy stories.

3258
02:13:57,430 --> 02:13:58,220
I'm just like,
yeah,

3259
02:13:58,220 --> 02:13:59,640
Berryman.
The water sounds great.

3260
02:13:59,670 --> 02:14:03,210
Inner dimensional child molesters are 
coming in through the cigarette,

3261
02:14:03,211 --> 02:14:04,044
smoke cigarettes with the 599 chemicals 
are designed to let the gates of hell 

3262
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:09,113
come loose.
Knit interdimensional child molesters 

3263
02:14:10,441 --> 02:14:13,860
come in and he just will go on and on 
and on.

3264
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:15,083
I love the interdimensional child 
molester thing because it's like they 

3265
02:14:18,481 --> 02:14:19,314
have interdimensional travel 
capabilities and they're like immediate 

3266
02:14:22,711 --> 02:14:24,090
thing.
Like what do we use this for?

3267
02:14:24,150 --> 02:14:27,990
I know what's will kids will rape kids 
and other dimensions,

3268
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:29,580
you know,
like what?

3269
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:30,563
Well there always is that really the 
best application of that fucking 

3270
02:14:32,341 --> 02:14:33,174
technology.
They're always like the archetypes of 

3271
02:14:34,921 --> 02:14:37,770
like when you get into the really hard 
core conspiracy theorists,

3272
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:38,633
the heart,
the archetypes are always like very 

3273
02:14:39,571 --> 02:14:40,404
satanic.
The archetypes are always like a 

3274
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:43,013
eugenics.
Like they want to kill off a massive 

3275
02:14:44,641 --> 02:14:46,360
amount of the population.
Um,

3276
02:14:46,710 --> 02:14:48,870
engineering a master race,
like,

3277
02:14:49,150 --> 02:14:49,983
oh,
there's all like keeping all the 

3278
02:14:51,241 --> 02:14:54,690
medicine and the resources for the 
elites killing off everyone else.

3279
02:14:55,060 --> 02:14:56,940
Uh,
preparing to get off this planet because

3280
02:14:56,970 --> 02:14:58,710
they know it's doom cause Nibiru who's 
coming?

3281
02:14:58,860 --> 02:14:59,693
It's all this like apocalyptic shit.
It's really fascinating because it's 

3282
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:06,330
like so much of it revolves around 
these,

3283
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:07,223
these like,
and then they sell supplements and 

3284
02:15:08,341 --> 02:15:09,090
survival kits.

3285
02:15:09,090 --> 02:15:11,670
Well that's what he does.
Nobody sells a better than Jim Baker.

3286
02:15:11,671 --> 02:15:13,800
He sells them his furniture.
He seen that video.

3287
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:15,780
He's selling his toilets.
Dude.

3288
02:15:15,990 --> 02:15:17,160
Have you seen him sell it?
Like,

3289
02:15:17,370 --> 02:15:18,203
you know,
after he says after the bonus bucket is 

3290
02:15:19,561 --> 02:15:21,930
empty,
you can use it as a toilet.

3291
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:23,453
Oh,
so like when you're out there in the 

3292
02:15:24,031 --> 02:15:25,000
woods.
Yeah.

3293
02:15:25,030 --> 02:15:29,640
You know the modern plumbing after the 
apocalypse,

3294
02:15:30,150 --> 02:15:31,800
people don't even know how bad shit 
smells.

3295
02:15:31,801 --> 02:15:33,210
Cause most of the time you don't really 
smell it.

3296
02:15:33,211 --> 02:15:34,410
You smell it.
Water down,

3297
02:15:34,740 --> 02:15:36,330
plop logs.
When you,

3298
02:15:36,331 --> 02:15:38,670
when you take a shit in the woods,
that's when you really go,

3299
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:39,533
oh Jesus Christ.
And at least then you're outside with 

3300
02:15:42,301 --> 02:15:46,140
all that air and a nice stiff breeze.
But if you take a shit in a room,

3301
02:15:46,290 --> 02:15:48,720
in a bucket,
it's going to smell so horrible.

3302
02:15:48,721 --> 02:15:50,640
You will start gagging and throwing up.

3303
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:51,593
You'll be so disgusted.
Not to mention you'd have to actually 

3304
02:15:53,490 --> 02:15:54,323
eat,
they're supposedly fucking five years 

3305
02:15:56,191 --> 02:16:00,150
worth of disgusting macaroni and cheese 
or mashed potato.

3306
02:16:00,151 --> 02:16:02,670
It was to actually get the bucket empty 
enough to shit in it.

3307
02:16:02,730 --> 02:16:03,563
That's true.
So I mean like look at that as Jim 

3308
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:07,133
Beggar's bowl and look at all in any of 
these fucking old fucks gonna live long 

3309
02:16:09,661 --> 02:16:11,220
enough to even,
they are,

3310
02:16:11,221 --> 02:16:13,320
who cares if they survive the 
apocalypse?

3311
02:16:13,321 --> 02:16:16,500
They're fucking probably not even going 
to survive this demo for fuck's sake.

3312
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:17,353
Well you don't know is we are all 
battening down the hatches and waiting 

3313
02:16:20,461 --> 02:16:22,770
for Jesus's return.
Okay.

3314
02:16:22,771 --> 02:16:24,690
The slop that was in the bucket and the 
slap,

3315
02:16:24,691 --> 02:16:26,490
they're putting their mouths is not the 
same.

3316
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:27,840
Oh,
you think there's different?

3317
02:16:28,130 --> 02:16:30,010
It does not the same.
There's just

3318
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:32,470
like a rice pudding maybe.
It looks like a fine risotto.

3319
02:16:32,690 --> 02:16:33,820
It's a risk Soto.
Yeah.

3320
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:34,773
Oh,
look at those poor people in the 

3321
02:16:35,891 --> 02:16:36,724
audience.
Forget about being so fucking stupid 

3322
02:16:38,831 --> 02:16:41,230
that you watch it on tv because it's 
just on.

3323
02:16:41,350 --> 02:16:43,510
But imagine being so fucking stupid.
Like you said,

3324
02:16:44,330 --> 02:16:45,163
go to see the chairman today and take 
the bus into the town to go and sit in 

3325
02:16:49,271 --> 02:16:51,520
the audience and this in the past you're
doomed.

3326
02:16:51,550 --> 02:16:54,070
I think they offer them free food.
I think they tell him like,

3327
02:16:54,071 --> 02:16:55,780
yeah,
you get a free meal if you come in here.

3328
02:16:55,810 --> 02:16:57,580
That's all they need.
A free meal.

3329
02:16:57,610 --> 02:16:58,121
They're like,
Ooh,

3330
02:16:58,121 --> 02:16:59,440
sweet.
Free food.

3331
02:16:59,890 --> 02:17:01,960
All they probably excited to be on 
television as well.

3332
02:17:01,961 --> 02:17:02,960
That's true.
Books.

3333
02:17:03,010 --> 02:17:04,300
They have books open.
Pack that up.

3334
02:17:04,301 --> 02:17:05,134
Look,
but don't they have like books in their 

3335
02:17:08,111 --> 02:17:10,990
hands?
Probably those same books you see on the

3336
02:17:10,991 --> 02:17:11,320
stage.

3337
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:12,153
Probably just passing them out.
Get them to try to fucking buy this 

3338
02:17:13,841 --> 02:17:15,040
bonus bucket.
Shit.

3339
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:16,900
Hey look,
we've got like notes.

3340
02:17:16,990 --> 02:17:19,780
People are taking notes.
This is important stuff.

3341
02:17:19,810 --> 02:17:20,890
What's important?
Well,

3342
02:17:20,891 --> 02:17:21,724
okay,
if vile eat one played that Rojo would 

3343
02:17:25,221 --> 02:17:28,570
die.
I could be underground for 50 years.

3344
02:17:29,770 --> 02:17:33,160
I've got willpower.
I got a wind shirt on.

3345
02:17:33,161 --> 02:17:35,080
Look at these fucking people.
They're taking notes.

3346
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:37,720
Like,
this is like really important stuff that

3347
02:17:38,290 --> 02:17:40,750
Jim Baker's talking about.
I just loved this guy.

3348
02:17:40,751 --> 02:17:42,610
Keeps on keeping on.
Oh yeah.

3349
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:44,950
He's like the energizer bunny dude.
Yeah.

3350
02:17:44,951 --> 02:17:46,630
No one's talking to Jessica Hahn these 
days.

3351
02:17:46,930 --> 02:17:48,680
Okay.
Nobody even cares about her anymore.

3352
02:17:48,681 --> 02:17:50,650
I look at him.
He looks smooth as fuck.

3353
02:17:50,830 --> 02:17:53,860
He's got that sleek white hair.
I got a cute little beard.

3354
02:17:53,990 --> 02:17:55,570
Look at him.
He's thin.

3355
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:57,040
It looks healthy.
Passionate.

3356
02:17:57,070 --> 02:17:58,540
Yeah.
He's got the drive.

3357
02:17:58,541 --> 02:17:59,374
He's got the energy.
It's got this hot little piece of ass 

3358
02:18:00,971 --> 02:18:02,140
behind him in the green shirt.

3359
02:18:02,290 --> 02:18:03,250
Yeah.
Look at her.

3360
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:04,240
It's fun.
Actually.

3361
02:18:04,270 --> 02:18:06,490
If you watch this shit,
sometimes you'll see them like,

3362
02:18:06,630 --> 02:18:08,950
uh,
openly argue on the show.

3363
02:18:09,130 --> 02:18:11,530
But like,
it'll be like very like,

3364
02:18:12,380 --> 02:18:13,870
uh,
restrained.

3365
02:18:13,871 --> 02:18:14,704
Like I remember one time he was,
he was like talking about marijuana or 

3366
02:18:17,231 --> 02:18:18,064
something and he's like,
you used to smoke marijuana in your 

3367
02:18:20,381 --> 02:18:21,970
college days didn't change.
She's like,

3368
02:18:21,971 --> 02:18:23,140
Oh yeah.
And then,

3369
02:18:23,170 --> 02:18:24,003
you know,
just picture a smoking pot and taking 

3370
02:18:25,391 --> 02:18:26,830
tech like a champ.
Oh yeah.

3371
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:28,180
Right.
I mean,

3372
02:18:28,181 --> 02:18:28,960
uh,
she,

3373
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:30,400
she does have that vibe,
doesn't she?

3374
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:36,060
For sure on strong sure.
Trophy wife vibe going on.

3375
02:18:36,320 --> 02:18:38,350
Yeah.
Especially for someone that guy's age.

3376
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:40,270
Well,
we found out from the Jessica Hahn days,

3377
02:18:40,330 --> 02:18:42,160
that dude was a party.
He liked to party.

3378
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:43,263
That's his deal.
He likes to talk about the Lord and he 

3379
02:18:45,481 --> 02:18:48,390
may be even believes it,
but after that she has done woo,

3380
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:49,900
let's parties down to fuck.

3381
02:18:49,990 --> 02:18:50,823
Yeah.
That's what Christianity Christianity's 

3382
02:18:51,161 --> 02:18:51,941
all about.
Forgiveness.

3383
02:18:51,941 --> 02:18:52,670
Y'All.
Yeah.

3384
02:18:52,670 --> 02:18:54,460
Listen man,
I'm just get forgiven the next day.

3385
02:18:54,580 --> 02:18:56,320
That's a beautiful thing.
He's got a good market.

3386
02:18:56,590 --> 02:18:58,060
He's got it locked in.
Who's that?

3387
02:18:58,061 --> 02:19:00,100
Joel Olsteen guys that his name?
Yeah.

3388
02:19:00,220 --> 02:19:01,540
Joel Olsteen.
That guy.

3389
02:19:01,570 --> 02:19:03,070
He does arenas,
man.

3390
02:19:03,110 --> 02:19:03,581
Oh,
that guy.

3391
02:19:03,581 --> 02:19:04,414
Just the same place where we do the UFC.
He was coming the next day or the next 

3392
02:19:07,450 --> 02:19:07,751
week.
I was like,

3393
02:19:07,751 --> 02:19:10,900
that's crazy.
He fills the fucking arena.

3394
02:19:12,310 --> 02:19:15,520
Is that like prosperity doctrines shill?
Look at homeless people.

3395
02:19:16,510 --> 02:19:18,640
Maybe I'm in the wrong business.
Yeah.

3396
02:19:18,730 --> 02:19:19,840
I've thought about it before.
I'm like,

3397
02:19:19,841 --> 02:19:21,370
man,
how much do I have to know about Jesus?

3398
02:19:21,371 --> 02:19:23,440
Talk about him on stage.
Not a whole lot.

3399
02:19:24,310 --> 02:19:25,001
I was thinking like,
oh,

3400
02:19:25,001 --> 02:19:27,590
I could fucking spinned this yarn about 
like I used to be this,

3401
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:29,120
uh,
youtube atheists.

3402
02:19:29,121 --> 02:19:30,410
Yeah,
dude,

3403
02:19:30,411 --> 02:19:34,460
you should totally do that.
And now all deemed and I found Jesus and

3404
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:35,373
Oh yeah,
I'll just,

3405
02:19:35,590 --> 02:19:38,010
I'll do it all nice and conservative and
shit and,

3406
02:19:38,050 --> 02:19:38,661
and I'll be like,
yeah,

3407
02:19:38,661 --> 02:19:40,280
I found Jesus turned my life around.

3408
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:41,780
I was depressed.
We'll stop right there.

3409
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,070
Stop right there.
And no one's going to believe you.

3410
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:45,510
Change your fucking accent to a mocking 
southern accent.

3411
02:19:45,590 --> 02:19:47,930
You know,
obviously you can't do that for you,

3412
02:19:47,931 --> 02:19:50,450
but let's,
let's just run through how we would have

3413
02:19:50,451 --> 02:19:51,200
you do it.
Okay.

3414
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:52,630
If we're going to reinvent you,
look,

3415
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:54,440
let's just say the company,
the country,

3416
02:19:54,470 --> 02:19:56,630
rather,
move so far into conservatism.

3417
02:19:56,631 --> 02:19:58,580
That is dangerous.
Being an atheist is dangerous,

3418
02:19:58,581 --> 02:20:02,150
being a liberal and you've got a certain
amount of financial requirements.

3419
02:20:02,151 --> 02:20:03,860
Now you've got a mortgage,
you know,

3420
02:20:03,861 --> 02:20:05,540
maybe you got a car payment.
You're like,

3421
02:20:05,570 --> 02:20:06,403
well fuck man,
I need to get this money to keep coming 

3422
02:20:07,581 --> 02:20:09,020
in.
I know what I'm going to do.

3423
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:12,410
I'm going to reinvent myself and 
there'll be a performance art piece I do

3424
02:20:12,411 --> 02:20:14,540
for a few years or become a 
conservative.

3425
02:20:14,580 --> 02:20:16,450
Come conservative Christian.
Yeah.

3426
02:20:16,490 --> 02:20:17,960
Give my life over to Jesus.

3427
02:20:17,990 --> 02:20:20,570
What would be the event that we would 
need to talk about?

3428
02:20:20,571 --> 02:20:24,560
Like we'd have to describe an event that
motivated you to make the big chain.

3429
02:20:24,610 --> 02:20:26,990
Oh Shit.
It had to be something that I could,

3430
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:29,630
I could fake easily,
but it seems credible and believable.

3431
02:20:29,631 --> 02:20:32,270
Like maybe a little baby heart attack.
Oh yeah,

3432
02:20:32,271 --> 02:20:33,170
that's true.
Yeah.

3433
02:20:33,171 --> 02:20:34,270
You're a little overweight.
Yeah.

3434
02:20:34,271 --> 02:20:35,104
Yeah.
I guess it'd be like I had my heart 

3435
02:20:35,751 --> 02:20:38,360
attack and uh,
I can't even fucking,

3436
02:20:38,420 --> 02:20:42,260
maybe I could spend some kind of like 
near death yarn or some shit.

3437
02:20:42,290 --> 02:20:42,891
Yeah.
Yeah.

3438
02:20:42,891 --> 02:20:43,850
Look,
you blacked out.

3439
02:20:44,150 --> 02:20:44,983
Like something happened yet to like a 
little minor heart attack and your legs 

3440
02:20:47,061 --> 02:20:48,350
stop working.
You blacked out.

3441
02:20:48,710 --> 02:20:49,543
And I saw it was in a tunnel and I saw 
the lights and I felt like a presence 

3442
02:20:53,601 --> 02:20:56,930
and an energy love that I'd never 
experienced before.

3443
02:20:56,990 --> 02:20:57,740
What did,
what did,

3444
02:20:57,740 --> 02:21:00,590
what was your initial reaction to this 
love and this experience?

3445
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,520
Oh,
um hmm.

3446
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:04,993
I think,
uh,

3447
02:21:05,110 --> 02:21:05,960
she was,
Lord,

3448
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:07,550
should we go the hell route?
Should we go?

3449
02:21:07,551 --> 02:21:08,390
Like I saw,
you know,

3450
02:21:08,450 --> 02:21:10,790
I was cast out of this place and I went 
to hell.

3451
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:13,580
Or is that too over the top?
Here's my take on things.

3452
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:14,660
Yeah.
This is what I believe.

3453
02:21:14,690 --> 02:21:17,270
I believe you're allowed to talk about 
God all day long,

3454
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:18,283
but as soon as you talk about the devil,
only a select group of people are going 

3455
02:21:20,911 --> 02:21:21,830
to hear you.
That's true.

3456
02:21:21,831 --> 02:21:22,664
If you talk about your cause more people
believe in God and believing in the 

3457
02:21:24,481 --> 02:21:25,610
whole fuck.
Yeah.

3458
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:29,120
Not only that,
it's culturally acceptable to describe a

3459
02:21:29,121 --> 02:21:32,660
belief in a higher power.
And if you don't even say God,

3460
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:34,970
you get away with it.
Like for 90% of the people.

3461
02:21:35,030 --> 02:21:36,050
Oh yeah,
that's true.

3462
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:40,670
All you have to do is say I'm spiritual,
I'm nondenominational,

3463
02:21:40,671 --> 02:21:41,690
but I'm spiritual.

3464
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:44,540
And ultimately I believe in a higher 
power.

3465
02:21:44,570 --> 02:21:46,850
I just think it's very possible that 
some,

3466
02:21:46,870 --> 02:21:47,703
I,
I leave the option areas like the seven 

3467
02:21:49,371 --> 02:21:52,550
planets fucking thing.
Like what's that?

3468
02:21:52,610 --> 02:21:53,390
They say?
Uh,

3469
02:21:53,390 --> 02:21:54,223
it's like a,
it's like a reincarnation trope where 

3470
02:21:55,581 --> 02:21:58,480
you're like,
you go through like seven stages of,

3471
02:21:58,530 --> 02:22:03,260
of life where like the first year I 
think humans are like second or third on

3472
02:22:03,261 --> 02:22:05,030
the list.
But eventually,

3473
02:22:05,031 --> 02:22:09,080
like in your seventh life,
you become like a being of a,

3474
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:11,420
well,
I mean it's not necessarily your seventh

3475
02:22:11,421 --> 02:22:12,140
cause you're,
you're,

3476
02:22:12,140 --> 02:22:15,500
you're like repeatedly attempting you.
So you become like an enlightened being.

3477
02:22:15,530 --> 02:22:16,131
Yeah.
Like if you're,

3478
02:22:16,131 --> 02:22:17,810
if you're,
if you're a shitty human being,

3479
02:22:17,811 --> 02:22:20,180
you might get sent back or you might 
just be a human being again,

3480
02:22:20,181 --> 02:22:21,014
but eventually you get reincarnated is 
like an immortal being of the pure 

3481
02:22:25,891 --> 02:22:26,700
enlightenment

3482
02:22:26,700 --> 02:22:28,950
and just did one with the cosmos and all
that shit.

3483
02:22:28,980 --> 02:22:29,940
I got Dalai Lama.
Yeah,

3484
02:22:29,941 --> 02:22:30,930
you could do like a,
like a,

3485
02:22:30,931 --> 02:22:32,910
you know,
can you put the pedal that new age shit,

3486
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:35,180
right?
Because they've,

3487
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:37,650
they like said it and I'm like seven 
different planets too.

3488
02:22:37,651 --> 02:22:42,240
Like you go from one planet to the next 
as you progress up the ladder of fucking

3489
02:22:42,241 --> 02:22:43,950
liars.
This all of us.

3490
02:22:43,980 --> 02:22:45,720
But what is this?
What religion is this one?

3491
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:46,913
I don't know.
It's just some crazy shit I heard one 

3492
02:22:47,881 --> 02:22:48,714
time,
but I could roll with that seven 

3493
02:22:51,121 --> 02:22:51,900
planets.
Yeah.

3494
02:22:51,900 --> 02:22:55,130
You have seven times to re reinvent 
yourself and like totally.

3495
02:22:55,150 --> 02:22:57,120
I'm totally,
I have my shit together now.

3496
02:22:57,121 --> 02:22:59,550
I'm 500 years old,
but I'm totally together.

3497
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:02,880
Finally I can say I'm whole.
Nope.

3498
02:23:02,970 --> 02:23:03,803
Then you ascend.
Then you're saying you send to 

3499
02:23:05,011 --> 02:23:05,844
enlightenment to the seventh planet 
where you live out the rest of your 

3500
02:23:08,461 --> 02:23:09,090
existence.

3501
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:09,923
So in pure love and joy,
if we just had you talking on CNN again 

3502
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:15,840
and they would go,
well,

3503
02:23:15,841 --> 02:23:16,674
what,
what inspired you to make this decision 

3504
02:23:19,530 --> 02:23:24,480
after all your years of atheism,
youtube videos to become a Christian and

3505
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:27,960
now that you are a Christian,
are you going to take those videos down?

3506
02:23:29,460 --> 02:23:31,200
No,
I'm going to leave them up so people can

3507
02:23:31,201 --> 02:23:34,260
see that.
I really was this atheist.

3508
02:23:34,261 --> 02:23:38,100
I really did give credence to these 
atheist beliefs,

3509
02:23:38,790 --> 02:23:40,140
but now I've,
I've just,

3510
02:23:40,141 --> 02:23:40,974
I've,
I've rejected that all and in fact I'm 

3511
02:23:42,631 --> 02:23:43,464
going to go through all my old videos 
and rebut them and show where I was 

3512
02:23:47,221 --> 02:23:50,790
wrong and explain why I was wrong.
So stay tuned for that.

3513
02:23:51,130 --> 02:23:52,080
Oh,
genius.

3514
02:23:52,081 --> 02:23:54,510
I love it.
And you can also say,

3515
02:23:54,570 --> 02:23:55,403
you know what's really ironic is I did 
Joe Rogan's podcast and we joked around 

3516
02:23:59,311 --> 02:24:01,380
about this happening and then it did 
happen.

3517
02:24:01,380 --> 02:24:02,213
And it's so crazy.
You just fucked this whole plan because 

3518
02:24:03,890 --> 02:24:04,890
it's all,
it's all public.

3519
02:24:04,891 --> 02:24:05,251
No,
no,

3520
02:24:05,251 --> 02:24:06,680
no,
it's not because it's your,

3521
02:24:06,690 --> 02:24:07,523
your belief in the Lord.
So powerful that despite the fact that 

3522
02:24:09,811 --> 02:24:10,644
you talked about faking it,
you're going to talk about it in the 

3523
02:24:12,691 --> 02:24:14,760
exact same way because it actually did 
happen.

3524
02:24:15,010 --> 02:24:16,980
It's almost like God was like,
Oh,

3525
02:24:16,981 --> 02:24:18,300
you think you're so smart,
Tj?

3526
02:24:18,450 --> 02:24:19,410
Well,
I'll show you.

3527
02:24:19,590 --> 02:24:21,630
I'll show you and I'll have the exact 
same scenario,

3528
02:24:21,631 --> 02:24:24,420
play itself out and I will show myself 
to you and I will touch your heart.

3529
02:24:24,510 --> 02:24:25,260
Yeah,
there you got.

3530
02:24:25,260 --> 02:24:26,460
The Lord did.
He touched my heart,

3531
02:24:26,850 --> 02:24:27,840
tj.
Just a few,

3532
02:24:27,900 --> 02:24:30,840
a scant few years later.
How much my heart,

3533
02:24:30,870 --> 02:24:33,450
how much you think Joel Olsteen clears 
in one day.

3534
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:34,553
We can look,
you can look and his net worth some 

3535
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:39,620
probably scary.
And what's that's gotta be here.

3536
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:41,040
Supposedly what it's worth.

3537
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:46,100
56 million lives in a $10 million house.
It's a good little good little scan he's

3538
02:24:48,421 --> 02:24:49,254
got going.
That's probably more ag balling Hashtag 

3539
02:24:52,681 --> 02:24:54,660
ball and for Jesus.
That's incredible.

3540
02:24:54,990 --> 02:24:56,280
Now,
how does one justify that?

3541
02:24:56,281 --> 02:24:59,220
We had this guy on will mccaskill who,
uh,

3542
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:02,640
runs this organization called effective 
altruism.

3543
02:25:02,970 --> 02:25:07,970
He donates all of his income above 
$35,000 so he gets to $35,000.

3544
02:25:08,341 --> 02:25:10,170
He keeps that everything else he 
donates.

3545
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:12,540
Yeah.
That's like a real holy man.

3546
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:13,651
And a lot of ways.
I mean,

3547
02:25:13,651 --> 02:25:14,484
he's just living laughable.
Olsteen $56 million net worth $10 

3548
02:25:18,170 --> 02:25:20,220
million just comes home and his gold 
underwear.

3549
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:21,833
Well,
look,

3550
02:25:22,020 --> 02:25:23,560
he's kind of smart.
He's,

3551
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:25,960
he's built prosperity into the his 
doctrine.

3552
02:25:25,961 --> 02:25:28,510
Cause what he pedals is like,
if you,

3553
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:29,433
if you're good and God loves you,
God wants you to be successful and 

3554
02:25:32,171 --> 02:25:33,004
prosperous.
Right now there's nothing in Christian 

3555
02:25:35,321 --> 02:25:36,154
doctrine actually back that up.
Like Christians are persecuted and God 

3556
02:25:38,531 --> 02:25:40,420
does not give them an easy life.

3557
02:25:40,420 --> 02:25:41,253
They get crucified upside down and they 
get persecuted by authorities and all 

3558
02:25:44,051 --> 02:25:44,884
sorts of stuff.
But he's figured out some way to spin 

3559
02:25:46,811 --> 02:25:49,450
it.
Like if you love God and God loves you,

3560
02:25:49,451 --> 02:25:52,090
that God wants you to be successful.
So basically his,

3561
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:54,550
all his money in his houses and his 
prosperity,

3562
02:25:54,551 --> 02:25:55,384
that's all that's,
God gave that to me and that's part of 

3563
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:00,130
my faith.
Yeah,

3564
02:26:00,131 --> 02:26:01,390
but you asked for it,
bitch,

3565
02:26:01,450 --> 02:26:03,040
you asked for money.
The people paid,

3566
02:26:03,041 --> 02:26:05,440
they paid to hear the word of God and 
hearing it through you.

3567
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:06,333
God didn't get involved at any point.
What happens if somebody really 

3568
02:26:09,011 --> 02:26:13,120
charismatic who's really smart,
decides to play that as a scam?

3569
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:14,493
I mean,
it's happened a bunch of time start 

3570
02:26:15,681 --> 02:26:16,514
history,
but like someone is like a really good 

3571
02:26:18,131 --> 02:26:19,750
actor.
Like Denzel Washington,

3572
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:22,360
Denzel Washington becomes a religious 
icon too.

3573
02:26:22,410 --> 02:26:27,410
Could you imagine if Denzel Washington 
at a nowhere had some religious epiphany

3574
02:26:27,941 --> 02:26:32,941
or faked it and then decided to go on 
television and and,

3575
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:34,023
and had like a very powerful message for
people and then started making youtube 

3576
02:26:37,361 --> 02:26:39,880
videos and then started preaching and 
arenas.

3577
02:26:40,030 --> 02:26:41,710
People would,
oh my God,

3578
02:26:41,711 --> 02:26:43,720
you would leave there.
Your life would be changed.

3579
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:44,973
Denzel Washington,
Denzel Washington from like training 

3580
02:26:48,491 --> 02:26:49,324
day,
like the kind of fucking power that guy 

3581
02:26:51,701 --> 02:26:54,190
can deliver.
If he could deliver a sermon like that,

3582
02:26:54,370 --> 02:26:56,650
Joel Olsteen would just jump off a 
building.

3583
02:26:57,070 --> 02:26:57,903
He would watch that and go with the FEC 
business and Joel Olsteen would be like 

3584
02:27:00,521 --> 02:27:02,500
his opening act.
If an email is,

3585
02:27:02,501 --> 02:27:05,650
it would be like the shitty opening band
that no one cares about.

3586
02:27:05,860 --> 02:27:07,750
Yeah.
If you got like a real actor,

3587
02:27:07,751 --> 02:27:11,680
like a real powerful actor to go up 
there and do it in a real,

3588
02:27:11,740 --> 02:27:15,370
I mean there's like,
like a guy like Leonardo Dicaprio,

3589
02:27:15,610 --> 02:27:16,443
like Leonardo Dicaprio.
It's a problem with Leo is he's too 

3590
02:27:19,211 --> 02:27:21,970
handsome and he gets too much posey.
You're not going to take them seriously.

3591
02:27:21,971 --> 02:27:24,310
You just not,
he's just got too much money.

3592
02:27:24,430 --> 02:27:28,270
He's always bawling on all over the 
world is on yachts with models.

3593
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:29,860
Too much money.
I'm sorry.

3594
02:27:30,040 --> 02:27:30,873
But if we could get past that,
if somehow or another we could get past 

3595
02:27:33,791 --> 02:27:35,140
that,
like if that guy has settled down,

3596
02:27:35,141 --> 02:27:35,974
he had a wife and he had a kid and then 
he had some religious epiphany and then 

3597
02:27:40,031 --> 02:27:40,864
he really got close to the Lord and he 
was really like gathering up the 

3598
02:27:43,061 --> 02:27:44,920
scripture and then he started fucking 
preaching.

3599
02:27:44,950 --> 02:27:48,460
You really want this happen to you want,
I can sense it in you like,

3600
02:27:48,490 --> 02:27:49,350
oh yeah,
yeah.

3601
02:27:49,450 --> 02:27:53,350
Well I soon politics is for people that 
suck at Showbiz.

3602
02:27:53,380 --> 02:27:55,030
Yeah.
It's for ugly people.

3603
02:27:55,060 --> 02:28:00,060
The Suck Showbiz and that's essentially 
what religion is.

3604
02:28:00,310 --> 02:28:02,470
I mean it's like a four.
It's another form of show business.

3605
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:06,550
Does it mean what you're doing is by 
doing it that way.

3606
02:28:06,580 --> 02:28:09,430
The only way you do it that way is you 
have to put on a performance.

3607
02:28:09,431 --> 02:28:10,264
If you've got to stand in front of all 
those people and talk about what the 

3608
02:28:13,121 --> 02:28:15,210
Lord does to me,
like whatever.

3609
02:28:15,220 --> 02:28:18,430
What do you have passion for it or not.
That is an orchestrated performance.

3610
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:20,330
It's an art form.
Your design,

3611
02:28:20,380 --> 02:28:22,520
your riling sensibilities

3612
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:26,990
up and stimulating their minds.
Fucking weird.

3613
02:28:27,170 --> 02:28:29,780
It's a fucking weird way to worship.
You know,

3614
02:28:29,781 --> 02:28:32,450
it's very weird.
You pay a bunch of money to get no arena

3615
02:28:32,750 --> 02:28:36,560
and some con man screams and yells about
the lord and pretends that he could read

3616
02:28:36,561 --> 02:28:37,394
people's minds and heal the sick.
Those motherfuckers that touch people 

3617
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:43,900
wiggle there.
There.

3618
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:44,871
Oh,
your death.

3619
02:28:44,871 --> 02:28:47,690
I'll wiggle my finger in your ear and 
now you can hear it's a miracle.

3620
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:50,600
And then they're rushed off real quick.
You know,

3621
02:28:50,601 --> 02:28:54,020
like by deaf person or formerly deaf 
person.

3622
02:28:54,050 --> 02:28:56,840
What's really creepy when the,
I forget which one,

3623
02:28:56,870 --> 02:29:00,290
which guy got busted with the earpiece 
or the preacher.

3624
02:29:00,370 --> 02:29:05,300
They exposed to my James Randy.
That fucking set up that,

3625
02:29:05,301 --> 02:29:09,960
that the operation where you could hear 
his wife talking to him and tell him,

3626
02:29:09,990 --> 02:29:14,990
no doubt people yell is healer guys as 
Benny Hinn type dudes.

3627
02:29:15,101 --> 02:29:16,400
And I didn't destroy his career either.

3628
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:19,100
He kept going,
why don't people aren't reading?

3629
02:29:19,460 --> 02:29:22,760
Just keep going.
Peter popoff was Peter popoff.

3630
02:29:22,761 --> 02:29:23,594
Peter popoff.
I didn't know who that guy was to so 

3631
02:29:26,061 --> 02:29:27,290
many of them know.
It's just,

3632
02:29:27,291 --> 02:29:28,124
it's,
I guess that's the way they make a 

3633
02:29:28,641 --> 02:29:29,301
living.
Yeah.

3634
02:29:29,301 --> 02:29:31,760
It's a nice little racket.
They got going.

3635
02:29:31,761 --> 02:29:34,340
We were talking about doing it for you.
I think you could do it though.

3636
02:29:34,341 --> 02:29:35,810
You can fucking nail.
You could do it.

3637
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:38,690
Any of us could do it.
You could really do it.

3638
02:29:38,730 --> 02:29:39,660
I could really do it.
Yeah.

3639
02:29:39,700 --> 02:29:43,190
Cause I got the whole atheist angle.
I can play like I used to be this way,

3640
02:29:43,220 --> 02:29:47,420
but now I've seen the light,
the former amazing atheist.

3641
02:29:47,421 --> 02:29:49,400
Now the amazing Christian.

3642
02:29:51,830 --> 02:29:54,290
I can see the title now.
Yeah.

3643
02:29:54,380 --> 02:29:55,380
I have to get some,
uh,

3644
02:29:55,400 --> 02:29:57,110
like teeth.
Whitener and dude,

3645
02:29:57,111 --> 02:29:58,260
you get it.
Cut My hair a little bit.

3646
02:29:58,310 --> 02:29:59,510
Your hair short.
It'd be fine.

3647
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:01,040
Cut the hair a little shorter.
Yeah.

3648
02:30:01,340 --> 02:30:04,400
Find yourself a nice Christian Gal.
Dress up in a nice,

3649
02:30:04,590 --> 02:30:07,490
that's,
it would be hot Christian Pussy.

3650
02:30:07,730 --> 02:30:09,650
That's what took you over to the top.
Oh yeah.

3651
02:30:10,370 --> 02:30:11,390
I can even tell.
Tell him that.

3652
02:30:11,391 --> 02:30:11,751
Like,
look,

3653
02:30:11,751 --> 02:30:14,630
I just noticed that the Christian Pussy 
is just way higher caliber,

3654
02:30:14,631 --> 02:30:17,390
so it's way better.
They're freaks,

3655
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:19,490
they're all suppressed and when you 
finally get him alone,

3656
02:30:19,610 --> 02:30:21,650
they think Jesus isn't looking.
Yeah,

3657
02:30:21,740 --> 02:30:23,900
thank you.
And that's why I decided to convert.

3658
02:30:24,210 --> 02:30:26,570
Imagine if like it took a few years and 
then you had made it,

3659
02:30:26,571 --> 02:30:28,160
look,
I'm just going to be real with y'all.

3660
02:30:28,850 --> 02:30:33,050
I converted because Christian Pussy is 
the best pussy.

3661
02:30:33,170 --> 02:30:34,700
It's like it's not even close.

3662
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:36,470
You know it.
Come on.

3663
02:30:36,530 --> 02:30:37,363
Why do we mind?
You got to believe in Jesus when you 

3664
02:30:38,781 --> 02:30:39,614
just know.
I mean you know you fucking atheist 

3665
02:30:41,691 --> 02:30:44,120
pussy or a pagan pussy or whatever and 
you're like,

3666
02:30:44,150 --> 02:30:46,070
all right,
I guess this is okay,

3667
02:30:46,820 --> 02:30:50,330
but you hit that Christian pussy and you
just feel that the might of God touching

3668
02:30:50,331 --> 02:30:53,180
your cock is almost like Jesus himself 
is giving you a hand job.

3669
02:30:53,450 --> 02:30:54,283
Can you imagine if there was a belief 
system that changed the way your pussy 

3670
02:30:57,171 --> 02:30:58,190
felt?
Like if,

3671
02:30:58,230 --> 02:31:00,230
if,
if you knew that the girl didn't believe

3672
02:31:00,231 --> 02:31:01,064
in Jesus when you had sex,
like oh it was all wishy washy down 

3673
02:31:03,051 --> 02:31:04,750
there.
No structure.

3674
02:31:05,540 --> 02:31:06,373
Like,
like we were talking about this the 

3675
02:31:07,911 --> 02:31:11,060
other day about wild pigs that when wild
pigs get loose,

3676
02:31:11,061 --> 02:31:13,190
like you take a domestic pig,
when they get loose,

3677
02:31:13,400 --> 02:31:15,530
their body morphs,
their snout grows,

3678
02:31:15,531 --> 02:31:18,110
the hair gets thicker,
their tusks role grow longer.

3679
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:19,980
Imagine if like when a

3680
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:23,370
woman really believes in Jesus,
if she really believed in God,

3681
02:31:23,610 --> 02:31:28,500
her pussy would just tighten down like a
fist and you would realize it when you,

3682
02:31:28,501 --> 02:31:29,430
when you were fucking,
they're like,

3683
02:31:29,431 --> 02:31:30,690
wow,
the Lord is inside of her.

3684
02:31:30,691 --> 02:31:33,840
This is a garage should come inside of 
that cause I should make babies with her

3685
02:31:34,020 --> 02:31:35,630
because the Lord is inherent.
She really,

3686
02:31:35,790 --> 02:31:39,010
when the Lord Lord resides within this 
con man,

3687
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:41,190
we could maybe you could tell by having 
sex with them.

3688
02:31:41,290 --> 02:31:43,800
Imagine that and the guys would cry.

3689
02:31:44,210 --> 02:31:45,830
Bill grew,
believed in the Lord,

3690
02:31:46,600 --> 02:31:49,140
whoever,
girl bereaved or girl I believe,

3691
02:31:49,150 --> 02:31:51,470
believed in the Lord.
I was out outsource where I was like,

3692
02:31:51,471 --> 02:31:53,420
just take him out dick and a bucket of 
Jello.

3693
02:31:53,870 --> 02:31:56,240
There was enough and there's nothing.
There's no,

3694
02:31:56,241 --> 02:31:57,350
hey,
there's no hope.

3695
02:31:57,440 --> 02:31:58,340
There's no future.

3696
02:31:59,620 --> 02:32:01,930
And there's this guy holding his wife's 
hand,

3697
02:32:01,931 --> 02:32:02,764
like a death grip.
She's got this Christian smile and her 

3698
02:32:04,811 --> 02:32:06,220
eyes and you know,
our pussies,

3699
02:32:06,221 --> 02:32:09,340
a vice grip,
just up ball Milkin,

3700
02:32:09,341 --> 02:32:13,090
vice grip,
industrial suction power,

3701
02:32:16,700 --> 02:32:20,100
clamp down.
Imagine

3702
02:32:21,870 --> 02:32:24,410
there's already a lot more Christians.
Yes.

3703
02:32:24,430 --> 02:32:25,263
You know,
that would be something that would be 

3704
02:32:26,271 --> 02:32:27,104
something that would uh,
would definitely get people on the side 

3705
02:32:28,371 --> 02:32:29,204
of Christianity.
That's one of the weird things about 

3706
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:34,220
Islam.
This is only the more radical sex of it.

3707
02:32:34,221 --> 02:32:35,054
And the more,
the deeper that people get into it when 

3708
02:32:37,221 --> 02:32:41,180
they want to cover up the entire woman,
like cover everything came and see her,

3709
02:32:41,390 --> 02:32:43,130
can't even see her when she goes out,
cover it up.

3710
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:46,160
And the,
the idea is like if you don't cover up,

3711
02:32:46,161 --> 02:32:46,994
then you know,
men are just going to be like totally 

3712
02:32:48,081 --> 02:32:49,040
rape crazy.
Like,

3713
02:32:49,041 --> 02:32:50,570
oh my God,
they must,

3714
02:32:52,130 --> 02:32:54,230
they must really like the fuck.
Yeah.

3715
02:32:54,650 --> 02:32:55,850
I mean it was,
they,

3716
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:56,421
they,
you know,

3717
02:32:56,421 --> 02:32:56,960
like the,
the,

3718
02:32:56,960 --> 02:32:57,950
I don't know how,
how,

3719
02:32:58,250 --> 02:33:00,200
how true statistically it is.
But you know,

3720
02:33:00,201 --> 02:33:01,034
they say that like they're,
the rape is a big problem when they go 

3721
02:33:02,871 --> 02:33:05,210
to these western countries,
these refugees and shit.

3722
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:07,400
Oh they're probably not used to seeing 
all these little short,

3723
02:33:07,401 --> 02:33:09,530
short like God,
it's like a fucking buffet,

3724
02:33:09,531 --> 02:33:10,364
a pussy around here.
Don't you think that any country that 

3725
02:33:13,731 --> 02:33:14,564
has been around for as long,
like any part of the world really we're 

3726
02:33:17,301 --> 02:33:19,940
civilization has existed in [inaudible] 
for a long,

3727
02:33:19,941 --> 02:33:20,930
long,
long time.

3728
02:33:21,170 --> 02:33:23,720
It's very difficult to get those people 
off their old ways.

3729
02:33:24,170 --> 02:33:25,003
You know,
and when you're dealing with a place 

3730
02:33:26,361 --> 02:33:29,830
like the Middle East,
Iraq is the oldest with,

3731
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:31,033
they think that like sue mayor,
which is where our rack is as far as we 

3732
02:33:33,861 --> 02:33:34,694
know,
that's the oldest civilization we're 

3733
02:33:35,780 --> 02:33:37,970
currently totally aware of.
Right?

3734
02:33:38,150 --> 02:33:42,350
6,000 years ago there was people living 
in there and they had mathematics.

3735
02:33:42,351 --> 02:33:43,184
They had,
agriculture has really advanced 

3736
02:33:44,331 --> 02:33:49,130
civilization for the time and the,
the people that are there today in a lot

3737
02:33:49,131 --> 02:33:49,964
of ways.
I mean there's people who have come in 

3738
02:33:50,601 --> 02:33:51,434
and people have left.
But a lot of the fucking energy and the 

3739
02:33:53,811 --> 02:33:54,644
ideas that culture are still in some way
connected to this 6,000 year old 

3740
02:33:59,601 --> 02:34:02,210
culture.
We're still kinda fucked in this country

3741
02:34:02,211 --> 02:34:03,044
cause we're connected to,
the puritans were connected to the 

3742
02:34:04,731 --> 02:34:05,564
pilgrims that landed.
I mean all these people that came over 

3743
02:34:07,551 --> 02:34:08,384
here seeking religious freedom and they 
were super religious and super 

3744
02:34:11,451 --> 02:34:12,284
puritanical and their beliefs,
remember it wasn't just the puritans 

3745
02:34:14,530 --> 02:34:15,291
were saying it was,
it's,

3746
02:34:15,291 --> 02:34:17,620
it was kinda like the puritans were 
sent.

3747
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:18,110
Well

3748
02:34:18,110 --> 02:34:18,943
the puritans came here to escape 
religious persecution and then a lot of 

3749
02:34:20,681 --> 02:34:22,600
the dregs of their society were sent 
here.

3750
02:34:22,601 --> 02:34:23,680
Like,
get the fuck Outta here.

3751
02:34:23,681 --> 02:34:24,970
Go over there.
Yep,

3752
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:28,330
go colonize the new world forum,
a new life for yourself there.

3753
02:34:28,390 --> 02:34:29,770
That's my family.
Well,

3754
02:34:29,771 --> 02:34:30,604
you know,
that's what I'm saying like,

3755
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:32,740
but if you really look at it,
that's like the flip side.

3756
02:34:32,750 --> 02:34:33,583
I mean,
you can kind of even look at America 

3757
02:34:34,421 --> 02:34:35,890
today and still see like,
oh,

3758
02:34:35,891 --> 02:34:36,724
here's the pure,
here's where the puritan element comes 

3759
02:34:37,991 --> 02:34:40,630
in and here's where the degenerate scum 
fuck element comes in,

3760
02:34:40,631 --> 02:34:41,610
and then you got America,

3761
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:42,670
right,
right.

3762
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:45,520
Yeah.
It's a look.

3763
02:34:45,550 --> 02:34:46,383
Anytime you start a fresh country,
it's a God damn gamble and a bunch of 

3764
02:34:49,271 --> 02:34:51,730
people are going to come over here and 
you're not going to get the best stuff.

3765
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:52,773
But look at Australia.
Australia was started as a prison 

3766
02:34:54,251 --> 02:34:56,350
colony.
It's one of my favorite places to visit.

3767
02:34:56,351 --> 02:34:58,120
The people were fantastic.
Never been there.

3768
02:34:58,240 --> 02:34:59,410
Oh Man,
you'd love it.

3769
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:02,560
Fucking Melbourne is amazing.
It's amazing.

3770
02:35:02,561 --> 02:35:03,940
One of the best cities I've ever been 
to.

3771
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:06,880
The people are so cool.
They're like,

3772
02:35:06,881 --> 02:35:10,870
it's like a cool San Francisco type vibe
with a weird accent.

3773
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:14,710
Not Weird to them.
Fucking nicest people in the world.

3774
02:35:14,740 --> 02:35:15,573
There's so few of them.
They have it so much better over there 

3775
02:35:18,130 --> 02:35:18,963
because there's as many as there is in 
the La area and their entire fucking 

3776
02:35:23,351 --> 02:35:26,650
country.
Now what?

3777
02:35:27,010 --> 02:35:28,930
What I do?
That's a lot of fucking people,

3778
02:35:28,931 --> 02:35:29,770
man.
Oh you just like,

3779
02:35:29,771 --> 02:35:31,330
we're like,
I just,

3780
02:35:31,331 --> 02:35:32,380
cause I'm thinking about that,

3781
02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:34,690
like how ridiculously overpopulated we 
are.

3782
02:35:35,050 --> 02:35:35,883
Oh yeah,
the second I land in La like you go 

3783
02:35:38,711 --> 02:35:41,110
watch,
there's like a weird vibe instantly.

3784
02:35:41,111 --> 02:35:45,300
Like I just feel like way more guarded 
here and stuff cause I,

3785
02:35:45,320 --> 02:35:46,153
there's like a sense of like,
like a faint whiff of like violence 

3786
02:35:50,501 --> 02:35:54,190
that's always in the air here.
You can just feel like the tensions that

3787
02:35:54,191 --> 02:35:56,320
exist.
And I noticed people are like,

3788
02:35:56,380 --> 02:35:57,213
a lot of people aren't here a super 
apologetic all the time for like the 

3789
02:35:59,321 --> 02:36:00,154
slightest thing.
And I think it's just cause they all 

3790
02:36:00,911 --> 02:36:01,744
feel it.
Like there's like kind of a powder keg 

3791
02:36:03,311 --> 02:36:07,720
here that could just explode at anytime.
Or maybe they're just polite.

3792
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:09,153
They're not like,
what are people that are super 

3793
02:36:10,151 --> 02:36:12,300
apologetic about what look like I was 
when I went,

3794
02:36:12,510 --> 02:36:15,130
first thing happened to me when I walked
out of the airport was this guy,

3795
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:16,593
he's,
he's doing a suitcase and he hits my 

3796
02:36:18,011 --> 02:36:20,230
foot with it and he says he's sorry.

3797
02:36:20,230 --> 02:36:21,400
He's like,
oh I'm so sorry.

3798
02:36:21,430 --> 02:36:23,920
But he keeps pulling it like,
you know,

3799
02:36:23,921 --> 02:36:26,020
so he's not really changing what he's 
doing.

3800
02:36:26,050 --> 02:36:30,640
He's just given me an apology for it so 
I won't get mad about it basically.

3801
02:36:30,850 --> 02:36:31,301
Oh,
I see.

3802
02:36:31,301 --> 02:36:34,540
So he didn't stop what he's doing and 
readjust and try to not hit your foot?

3803
02:36:34,570 --> 02:36:36,250
Yeah,
I mean I just got out of the way at that

3804
02:36:36,251 --> 02:36:37,084
point,
but,

3805
02:36:37,270 --> 02:36:37,751
but you know,
it's,

3806
02:36:37,751 --> 02:36:39,820
it's,
it's like people around here,

3807
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:41,050
they almost,
they tried to like,

3808
02:36:41,140 --> 02:36:41,973
uh,
diffused a sorry over things to diffuse 

3809
02:36:43,721 --> 02:36:45,670
any possible like,
well if I say sorry,

3810
02:36:45,671 --> 02:36:46,504
then people won't be as pissed and 
everyone's kind of stepping on each 

3811
02:36:49,061 --> 02:36:50,590
other's toes here because it's so 
crowded.

3812
02:36:50,591 --> 02:36:51,424
There's so many fucking people,
there's so many different cultures 

3813
02:36:53,621 --> 02:36:55,000
trying to coexist,
you know,

3814
02:36:55,030 --> 02:36:56,920
in one place,
like even,

3815
02:36:57,850 --> 02:36:59,260
you know,
from Seattle and shit,

3816
02:36:59,261 --> 02:37:02,740
like the area I live in has got like a 
lot of Asians there and stuff,

3817
02:37:02,741 --> 02:37:07,741
but like you don't really feel that 
sense of like the clash going on or like

3818
02:37:08,111 --> 02:37:08,944
there's tensions between these different
groups of people because the attitude 

3819
02:37:11,330 --> 02:37:13,510
that they have like in the northwest,
uh,

3820
02:37:13,570 --> 02:37:15,770
at least the parts of it I live in and 
just kind of like,

3821
02:37:16,430 --> 02:37:18,230
people just can't really,
don't give a shit about each other.

3822
02:37:18,890 --> 02:37:20,870
And there's sort of like an air of like 
detached,

3823
02:37:20,871 --> 02:37:21,351
like,
yeah,

3824
02:37:21,351 --> 02:37:23,840
you know,
I'll be somewhat friendly and shit,

3825
02:37:23,841 --> 02:37:24,674
but we're not all going to fucking,
we're not going to exchange all these 

3826
02:37:27,651 --> 02:37:28,484
niceties and shit in his very brusque 
attitude and people are to speak the 

3827
02:37:31,641 --> 02:37:33,200
entire area.
Yes.

3828
02:37:33,290 --> 02:37:36,590
You view this spokesperson.
I am their spokesperson in Seattle to be

3829
02:37:36,591 --> 02:37:37,700
very friendly.
Well,

3830
02:37:37,701 --> 02:37:40,370
I don't live exactly in Seattle.
So maybe you're in the area where people

3831
02:37:40,371 --> 02:37:42,050
go to escape the friendliness of 
Seattle,

3832
02:37:42,051 --> 02:37:42,884
maybe.
So.

3833
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:44,630
Maybe I am.
Well,

3834
02:37:44,631 --> 02:37:45,070
I mean,
I,

3835
02:37:45,070 --> 02:37:45,891
there's a lot,
like I said,

3836
02:37:45,891 --> 02:37:47,570
there's a lot of Asians there.
They tend to be brusque.

3837
02:37:47,571 --> 02:37:49,970
I feel like racism here comes,
Oh yeah.

3838
02:37:50,390 --> 02:37:52,920
Especially against Eskimos.
I don't fucking put up with that in you.

3839
02:37:52,930 --> 02:37:54,840
Which shit?
Yeah,

3840
02:37:54,850 --> 02:37:56,420
I'd like Pacific northwest.

3841
02:37:56,450 --> 02:37:57,940
I think it's a,
you're,

3842
02:37:57,950 --> 02:37:58,783
there's a neat,
unique connection with nature when you 

3843
02:38:00,231 --> 02:38:02,720
get rained on all the time and 
everything's green is fuck.

3844
02:38:02,780 --> 02:38:03,613
Oh yeah.
I think you guys have a better 

3845
02:38:04,221 --> 02:38:05,740
connection with nature.
Like A,

3846
02:38:05,741 --> 02:38:08,660
I have some friends that live in Ballard
and we went to,

3847
02:38:08,661 --> 02:38:10,520
um,
there's a park over there,

3848
02:38:10,790 --> 02:38:11,623
you know,
and they have kids that are my kids' 

3849
02:38:13,071 --> 02:38:13,904
age.
We all went to the park and we were 

3850
02:38:14,571 --> 02:38:16,790
hanging out there and we're like,
God damn,

3851
02:38:16,791 --> 02:38:18,740
everything is so green.
It was like,

3852
02:38:18,741 --> 02:38:21,140
you guys are not just used to this.
Like this is like normal for you.

3853
02:38:21,141 --> 02:38:21,820
Right?
Yeah.

3854
02:38:21,820 --> 02:38:22,351
And we will.
And,

3855
02:38:22,351 --> 02:38:23,184
and,
and it was a rare day where it was like 

3856
02:38:24,501 --> 02:38:26,330
super sunny and warm and it was like,
okay,

3857
02:38:26,331 --> 02:38:27,164
if this was like this all the time,
do you know this place would be so 

3858
02:38:29,961 --> 02:38:31,070
fucking crowded?

3859
02:38:31,460 --> 02:38:32,293
Like your,
your relationship that you have with 

3860
02:38:33,891 --> 02:38:38,150
nature is what keeps people away.
But it also enhances,

3861
02:38:38,210 --> 02:38:39,043
in my opinion,
the way the people that live there look 

3862
02:38:40,551 --> 02:38:42,200
at things.
I think they're more grounded.

3863
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:43,073
Yeah.
Like I,

3864
02:38:43,220 --> 02:38:45,070
I'm not really one who like,
uh,

3865
02:38:45,140 --> 02:38:48,380
focuses a lot on like the physical 
beauty of an area.

3866
02:38:48,410 --> 02:38:53,410
But like I love just driving through 
like over a bridge or something in,

3867
02:38:54,921 --> 02:38:55,550
uh,
in,

3868
02:38:55,550 --> 02:38:56,383
in the Seattle area and just seeing all 
the fucking hills and all the entries 

3869
02:38:59,961 --> 02:39:03,710
and all the water and everything just 
looks really like serene and picturesque

3870
02:39:03,711 --> 02:39:06,560
and beautiful even though you know,
there's a shit ton of people there.

3871
02:39:06,650 --> 02:39:08,610
Yeah,
there's a giant potluck,

3872
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:11,420
but like in la it's like there's the,
the sun and everything,

3873
02:39:11,421 --> 02:39:13,250
but you just,
it just looks like a fucking,

3874
02:39:13,630 --> 02:39:14,463
when you fly in la,
that's just like a big grid of fucking 

3875
02:39:16,431 --> 02:39:17,750
lights and shit.

3876
02:39:17,780 --> 02:39:21,890
There's not much of a of nature left for
you to be like,

3877
02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:24,590
ah,
well this is a flat patch of desert.

3878
02:39:24,890 --> 02:39:26,900
They slapped all these stupid buildings 
up on.

3879
02:39:26,901 --> 02:39:27,734
If it wasn't for this,
it'd be like chaparral and fucking 

3880
02:39:30,530 --> 02:39:31,363
tumbleweeds and dirt.
But what Seattle also has is you guys 

3881
02:39:34,581 --> 02:39:37,950
have the ocean and the mountains all 
just jammed up on top of you too.

3882
02:39:38,380 --> 02:39:41,720
Like you can get to mount rainier from 
Seattle and what is it like 70 minutes,

3883
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:44,510
something like that.
I think it might be a little longer,

3884
02:39:44,511 --> 02:39:47,180
but maybe an hour and a half,
two hours at the most because we were,

3885
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:50,000
we were up there,
big foot squash and we were squashing me

3886
02:39:50,001 --> 02:39:52,490
and Duncan trussell and we drove down 
from there,

3887
02:39:52,491 --> 02:39:55,110
from Mount Rainier to a hotel in,
you know,

3888
02:39:55,130 --> 02:39:55,963
in the mainland and the regular area.
So it was close enough that like within 

3889
02:39:59,540 --> 02:40:00,373
two hours or whatever it was,
we could be in the middle of this 

3890
02:40:01,821 --> 02:40:04,790
incredible rain forest and then go right
back down then.

3891
02:40:04,791 --> 02:40:06,590
And you're looking at the ocean right 
there too.

3892
02:40:06,980 --> 02:40:10,310
It's just so fucking vibrant.
I look at it,

3893
02:40:10,330 --> 02:40:12,770
it's like where I live,
I'm like,

3894
02:40:12,830 --> 02:40:13,980
I feel like I'm in the middle of

3895
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:18,800
the fucking woods are,
but I can drive five minutes and be in,

3896
02:40:18,801 --> 02:40:20,870
in the downtown area.
Right.

3897
02:40:21,030 --> 02:40:22,010
It's just crazy.
Yeah,

3898
02:40:22,020 --> 02:40:23,580
it is crazy.
You can't really get that.

3899
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:24,473
Uh,
in,

3900
02:40:24,480 --> 02:40:25,260
in La.
No.

3901
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:27,090
And you have a good amount of people up 
there too.

3902
02:40:27,091 --> 02:40:27,924
Like what is Seattle's population,
like 5 million or something of the 

3903
02:40:30,571 --> 02:40:32,820
entire metropolitan area.
Something like that.

3904
02:40:32,900 --> 02:40:34,650
I know off hand,
but find out what it is.

3905
02:40:34,651 --> 02:40:37,020
Young Jamie,
I'm going to guess it's like 5 million,

3906
02:40:37,021 --> 02:40:37,854
which I think you should put a cap on.
Don't let anybody move to me will die 

3907
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:41,910
dude.
Like even when I moved there,

3908
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:47,000
less than 5 million.
How many city says it's only 650,000 you

3909
02:40:47,731 --> 02:40:50,040
got to look at the Seattle metropolitan 
area though.

3910
02:40:50,430 --> 02:40:53,040
That's a good number though.
650,000 that's beautiful.

3911
02:40:53,070 --> 02:40:53,903
But even when I moved there,
like when I told people just went 7 

3912
02:40:56,550 --> 02:40:58,650
million,
703.7 so that ain't shit.

3913
02:40:58,740 --> 02:40:59,580
That's beautiful.
Yeah.

3914
02:40:59,581 --> 02:41:00,990
You know,
but like even when I moved there,

3915
02:41:00,991 --> 02:41:04,770
like people are already kind of like,
I could sense like people being like,

3916
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:05,633
Eh,
more people and people always do that 

3917
02:41:08,611 --> 02:41:09,150
though,
man.

3918
02:41:09,150 --> 02:41:09,601
Yeah.
They're like,

3919
02:41:09,601 --> 02:41:10,740
no,
we're good.

3920
02:41:11,490 --> 02:41:12,480
It's just like you said,
you know,

3921
02:41:12,481 --> 02:41:14,880
like,
let's try to try to stop anyone new from

3922
02:41:14,881 --> 02:41:16,210
coming.
Greedy fucks.

3923
02:41:16,211 --> 02:41:17,044
It's like,
fuck you.

3924
02:41:17,190 --> 02:41:20,310
You've got a great spot.
If you wanted to go more hippy though,

3925
02:41:20,311 --> 02:41:22,650
would you go portland?
Uh,

3926
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:24,000
no.
No.

3927
02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:25,860
I don't know.
I've never really been to portland sweet

3928
02:41:25,861 --> 02:41:26,694
spot.
I'm actually planning on going to 

3929
02:41:27,901 --> 02:41:31,710
Portland to see,
you're a concert you're doing there.

3930
02:41:32,180 --> 02:41:33,990
Yeah.
20th of February.

3931
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:35,820
Don't.
By 20th of April.

3932
02:41:35,850 --> 02:41:36,840
You didn't buy tickets,
did you?

3933
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:38,820
I don't know.
I'll hook it up.

3934
02:41:39,030 --> 02:41:40,440
Yeah,
I got a lot of people coming.

3935
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:41,390
Okay.
How many people?

3936
02:41:42,900 --> 02:41:44,670
Uh,
six or seven.

3937
02:41:44,970 --> 02:41:45,750
I can make that happen.

3938
02:41:45,750 --> 02:41:46,583
All right,
cool.

3939
02:41:46,830 --> 02:41:48,570
But um,
that's bought is a,

3940
02:41:48,571 --> 02:41:50,520
portland to me is like,
um,

3941
02:41:51,030 --> 02:41:51,863
there's a few,
there's like a handful of places that I 

3942
02:41:52,861 --> 02:41:56,260
would live outside of La,
Seattle,

3943
02:41:56,360 --> 02:41:58,770
Seattle for sure.
Portland for sure.

3944
02:41:58,980 --> 02:42:00,120
Denver,
Austin,

3945
02:42:00,121 --> 02:42:02,190
Texas.
And then it would get weird.

3946
02:42:02,760 --> 02:42:04,650
I get weird after that.
Everything else would get like,

3947
02:42:04,651 --> 02:42:05,790
man,
maybe I could do it,

3948
02:42:06,060 --> 02:42:08,670
but outside of Denver or boulder,
when I say Denver,

3949
02:42:08,671 --> 02:42:09,630
I'm really mean.
Colorado.

3950
02:42:09,631 --> 02:42:11,240
Like I could live in aspen too.
I love it.

3951
02:42:11,290 --> 02:42:12,123
I love when I was trying to escape Ohio,
like we all sat down and we were trying 

3952
02:42:14,791 --> 02:42:15,624
to all come to a consensus about where 
to move to and like a lot of those 

3953
02:42:17,911 --> 02:42:20,910
places were considered like we,
we were tossing around Austin,

3954
02:42:21,230 --> 02:42:22,063
we were tossing around La,
we were tossing around Portland and 

3955
02:42:24,241 --> 02:42:25,074
we're tossing around Seattle.
So it's kind of pretty similar places 

3956
02:42:27,571 --> 02:42:28,404
where we would live.

3957
02:42:28,440 --> 02:42:31,380
Those are the only places cause I was 
not happy living in Columbus,

3958
02:42:31,381 --> 02:42:32,520
Ohio.
Yeah.

3959
02:42:32,521 --> 02:42:35,700
Well there's a lot of great people in 
Columbus.

3960
02:42:35,701 --> 02:42:38,010
Sure.
But that winter can suck my dick.

3961
02:42:38,970 --> 02:42:39,541
Yeah,
that's,

3962
02:42:39,541 --> 02:42:41,220
we were done with it.
Fuck you.

3963
02:42:41,790 --> 02:42:44,790
Giant mountains of fucking snow just 
piling on us.

3964
02:42:44,791 --> 02:42:45,624
I mean,
I mean Duncan trussell I'm texting him 

3965
02:42:47,071 --> 02:42:47,904
every day.
Fuck New York City cause another 

3966
02:42:48,841 --> 02:42:49,950
blizzard just hit,
you know,

3967
02:42:49,951 --> 02:42:52,320
and I'm like fuck you and fuck New York 
because Duncan just moved there.

3968
02:42:52,321 --> 02:42:53,910
I'm like,
why'd you leave me bitch,

3969
02:42:53,940 --> 02:42:54,773
you leave.
You left me and went to a stupid spot 

3970
02:42:56,011 --> 02:42:58,230
that's nose in the middle of Goddamn 
March.

3971
02:42:58,320 --> 02:42:59,640
It's deep.
We're deep into March.

3972
02:42:59,641 --> 02:43:00,474
Right.
What is it like the 16th or something 

3973
02:43:02,430 --> 02:43:05,610
15th Fuck Outta here.
Can't be snowing.

3974
02:43:05,970 --> 02:43:07,260
That's,
that's too late.

3975
02:43:07,710 --> 02:43:09,270
It's no more snow.
No,

3976
02:43:09,271 --> 02:43:09,991
no,
stop it.

3977
02:43:09,991 --> 02:43:11,800
It's not allowed to snow anymore.
Fuck this.

3978
02:43:11,860 --> 02:43:13,420
You get jammed in there for a couple of 
days.

3979
02:43:13,420 --> 02:43:14,253
But even that,
like I think New York is a weird 

3980
02:43:16,121 --> 02:43:19,450
combination of weather and extreme 
population.

3981
02:43:19,720 --> 02:43:22,660
I think when you get that,
whether there could be,

3982
02:43:22,661 --> 02:43:23,494
there's good things like what Seattle 
has is like a good amount of whether 

3983
02:43:25,721 --> 02:43:26,554
like it gets rain but it only snow.
It was like a couple of days a year if 

3984
02:43:29,831 --> 02:43:30,664
that,
like it only gets below actually a 

3985
02:43:32,141 --> 02:43:35,270
pretty weirdly heavy snow storm.
Um,

3986
02:43:35,410 --> 02:43:36,190
this year.
Yeah,

3987
02:43:36,190 --> 02:43:37,350
I saw that.
But um,

3988
02:43:37,390 --> 02:43:40,150
that was very unusual for the area.
Yeah,

3989
02:43:40,151 --> 02:43:40,990
like spring,
the winter,

3990
02:43:40,991 --> 02:43:43,810
it's more like just constant cold,
dreary,

3991
02:43:43,811 --> 02:43:45,460
rainy.
But I'm okay with that.

3992
02:43:45,490 --> 02:43:48,250
Like I walk out in the sun in la here 
and I'm like,

3993
02:43:48,251 --> 02:43:50,690
fuck this shit.
Like I'm,

3994
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:52,750
I'm look how white I am.
Look at this.

3995
02:43:52,751 --> 02:43:53,310
I mean,
I don't,

3996
02:43:53,310 --> 02:43:56,380
I don't want that.
You love the overcast skies.

3997
02:43:56,381 --> 02:43:58,900
I love the rain.
Do you love reasons to be depressed?

3998
02:43:59,440 --> 02:44:00,101
I mean,
I don't,

3999
02:44:00,101 --> 02:44:00,934
I don't need a reason to be depressed.
I'll be depressed no matter where the 

4000
02:44:02,561 --> 02:44:05,830
fuck I am.
My surroundings might as well at least a

4001
02:44:05,831 --> 02:44:07,960
reflected.
Um,

4002
02:44:07,990 --> 02:44:10,540
you get used to the weather out here,
you get used to this son.

4003
02:44:10,570 --> 02:44:12,820
But I'll tell you one time I lived,
I used to live in Palmdale.

4004
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:14,080
Oh,
did just so I Kinda,

4005
02:44:14,081 --> 02:44:17,110
I kinda understand the climate a little 
bit that places a bit mathy.

4006
02:44:17,230 --> 02:44:19,480
Yeah.
Palm Dale gets a bit messy.

4007
02:44:19,481 --> 02:44:21,070
It gets a bit messy.
And in and Audi,

4008
02:44:21,100 --> 02:44:24,310
there's a lot of in and outs out there.
It seems like main food source be in and

4009
02:44:24,311 --> 02:44:26,590
out and then quite methy.
Yeah.

4010
02:44:27,660 --> 02:44:28,720
Uh,
I just remember,

4011
02:44:28,721 --> 02:44:29,554
you know,
I remember living out there and just 

4012
02:44:29,980 --> 02:44:31,130
seeing like the,
you know,

4013
02:44:31,131 --> 02:44:33,490
it was just like,
we want to live near La,

4014
02:44:33,491 --> 02:44:35,320
but yeah.
You know,

4015
02:44:35,350 --> 02:44:37,710
we don't really want to pay la prices so
exact.

4016
02:44:37,710 --> 02:44:40,750
Homedale and they did just have to 
commute every day for an hour,

4017
02:44:41,320 --> 02:44:42,153
which if you see it in the morning,
I drove up there once real early in the 

4018
02:44:44,861 --> 02:44:48,370
morning.
I was driving up towards Bakersfield and

4019
02:44:48,371 --> 02:44:49,810
it was like,
boy,

4020
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:50,673
I want to say like before dawn.
So it was about five 30 in the morning 

4021
02:44:53,740 --> 02:44:58,740
and the amount of people coming towards 
la from way past bakersfield was fucking

4022
02:44:59,471 --> 02:45:01,780
stunning.
Like stunning.

4023
02:45:01,781 --> 02:45:02,614
Like I really had no idea.
And it's people that can't afford 

4024
02:45:04,751 --> 02:45:05,584
housing in La and so they commute and 
they commute and they have to get up 

4025
02:45:08,651 --> 02:45:09,484
really early in the morning to do it 
because at five 30 in the fucking 

4026
02:45:11,891 --> 02:45:12,724
morning,
it's bumper to bumper traffic on the 

4027
02:45:14,861 --> 02:45:16,360
five.
It's nuts,

4028
02:45:16,361 --> 02:45:16,931
man.
Like yeah,

4029
02:45:16,931 --> 02:45:18,910
I ain't never seen anything like it when
you,

4030
02:45:18,911 --> 02:45:19,321
you,
you,

4031
02:45:19,321 --> 02:45:20,650
you just go,
oh my God.

4032
02:45:20,651 --> 02:45:22,600
Like this is something that I didn't 
even realize was an issue.

4033
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:23,673
All those people that can't afford to 
live in La and they drive down and it's 

4034
02:45:26,181 --> 02:45:27,014
a lot of fucking people that live out 
there and drive down here for work a 

4035
02:45:30,881 --> 02:45:32,650
lot.
They should just build it.

4036
02:45:32,651 --> 02:45:34,990
They should put in some high speed rail 
and just fucking with it,

4037
02:45:34,991 --> 02:45:38,700
talking about doing more affordable 
housing along the way for people to just

4038
02:45:38,710 --> 02:45:42,310
establish these artificial communities.
But there's a lot of resistance to that.

4039
02:45:42,460 --> 02:45:45,280
People that live in that area don't want
those areas developed.

4040
02:45:45,930 --> 02:45:48,700
Who the fuck knows?
Now we're developers.

4041
02:45:48,730 --> 02:45:50,260
Now we're talking.
When we're talking to Melvin,

4042
02:45:50,470 --> 02:45:52,270
we talked about,
and we talk about Jesus.

4043
02:45:52,271 --> 02:45:54,340
We talked about bossy and we talked 
about waffles.

4044
02:45:54,460 --> 02:45:57,310
Does anything we should talk about land 
development.

4045
02:45:57,370 --> 02:45:59,380
Same thing.
We should take back what we said today.

4046
02:45:59,410 --> 02:46:00,280
I thought,
I don't feel bad.

4047
02:46:00,281 --> 02:46:01,630
I feel,
I feel pretty good.

4048
02:46:01,660 --> 02:46:03,010
I feel pretty good.
I'm pretty good about it.

4049
02:46:03,830 --> 02:46:04,663
I'm not,
I don't feel like there's anything that 

4050
02:46:05,471 --> 02:46:07,750
was said that needs to be like,
oh,

4051
02:46:07,751 --> 02:46:10,040
we better revoke that.
People take it

4052
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:12,590
the wrong way or so.
You definitely are going to fuck them.

4053
02:46:12,680 --> 02:46:14,330
There's nothing you can do about that.
Nope.

4054
02:46:14,660 --> 02:46:16,850
But it is what it is.
Uh,

4055
02:46:16,851 --> 02:46:18,710
if people want to see your youtube 
videos,

4056
02:46:18,711 --> 02:46:20,660
your channel is still the amazing 
atheist.

4057
02:46:20,690 --> 02:46:22,610
That's right.
Or they can check out my podcast,

4058
02:46:22,611 --> 02:46:24,950
a drunken peasants,
and that is the podcast.

4059
02:46:24,980 --> 02:46:25,813
No matter what Bill Maher says,
your podcasts is essentially the 

4060
02:46:28,101 --> 02:46:29,240
podcast.
It's sunk.

4061
02:46:29,510 --> 02:46:31,040
Milo.
That is wasn't mine.

4062
02:46:31,130 --> 02:46:31,581
I mean,
well,

4063
02:46:31,581 --> 02:46:34,310
Milo Sunk Milo more than anyone else 
did,

4064
02:46:34,700 --> 02:46:36,170
but thanks dude.
Let's do this more often.

4065
02:46:36,171 --> 02:46:37,004
All right,
cool.

4066
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:38,570
Thank you.
Thank you for having me.

4067
02:46:38,630 --> 02:46:39,850
Bye everybody.
See you.

4068
02:46:45,410 --> 02:46:50,370
