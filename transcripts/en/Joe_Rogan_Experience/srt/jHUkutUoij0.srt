1
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,080
Oh my man,

2
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:14,990
Duncan Trussell has been
here for the podcast.

3
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:17,080
I believe this maybe
the fifth or six times.

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,270
I think you've been on more than anybody
else and said you're the greatest guy

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:21,730
ever.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,880
Crt is nobody better
than you for the podcast.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,470
You're the most entertaining.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,483
Interesting.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,390
And you're changing the world,

10
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:27,810
dude.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,680
Whether they liked it or not.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,150
You're freaking p two
fists and flashlights.

13
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,523
It's got two.

14
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,360
He's got one that he could
pretend as a beer can.

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,510
It's kind of sneaky ass asshole.

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,603
That's better.

17
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,450
I theoretically at the front and the back,

18
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,180
maybe a mouth feel.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:49,561
Oh,

20
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:51,180
it says like girls.

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,850
I think it's a model that there
some particularly fun stuff.

22
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,020
Let's see.

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,561
Oh my God.

24
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:57,290
It's modeled after Margaret Thatcher.

25
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,060
Pour it out.

26
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,640
Imagine Margaret Thatcher was into,

27
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,320
this is modeled after
someone named Teagan.

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,990
It comes with Lou and I
guess it's modeled after her.

29
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,030
He put apparently plays guitar.

30
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,530
She's pictured here with
the electric guitar.

31
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,530
What is that,

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,433
sir?

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,681
How did they do that?

34
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:26,681
Is that a little cliches or a muscle
car behind her to Mustang perhaps your

35
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,860
break Christmas.

36
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,880
You know what?

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,960
Holding the flashlight.

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,640
I could say anything.

39
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:36,300
I get like come up with
like cure for all disease.

40
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,130
You know the,

41
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,330
you're in the perfect position as a
comic where if you were sending girls

42
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,111
pictures of your Dick,

43
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:48,840
it wouldn't hurt your career at all.

44
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,190
You would go on stage and say,

45
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:51,030
look guys,

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,870
here's the deal.

47
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,700
Okay.

48
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,101
I,

49
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:53,461
yes,

50
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,420
what I did was stupid,

51
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:58,110
but I get lonely and I'm in front
of my computer and I do dumb shit.

52
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,180
I'm not a bad person or hurting anybody.

53
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,580
Yeah.

54
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,040
Never even fucked anybody.

55
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,040
He never even fucked anybody who wiener.

56
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,730
Please don't.

57
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,400
We did.

58
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,760
Sherry didn't catch him
fucking end game and catch him,

59
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:12,060
but he definitely did
well in this little thing.

60
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:13,020
What got him fired?

61
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,870
None of it had to do with
him fucking somebody.

62
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,213
He definitely,

63
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,510
someone's skeptical.

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,530
I'm skeptical that he did that.

65
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:24,640
He just sent pictures of his direct
cock and underwear and nothing else.

66
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:25,320
It's the end.

67
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,250
Everybody's got their thing.

68
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,961
Did we ever dated a girl?

69
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:28,760
Doesn't anyone have sex?

70
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,080
Just wants to blow you now.

71
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,050
Now you've never dated a girl
who only wants to give blowjobs.

72
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,390
I would hate that girl.

73
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,280
I know a few friends
that have had that girl.

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,001
Yeah,

75
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:42,571
I know.

76
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:43,630
I have one friend who's like,

77
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:44,580
you shouldn't even know like sex.

78
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,720
She just likes to blow me and then

79
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,570
she have a penis.

80
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,690
Maybe no sex before.

81
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,740
She just doesn't like it.

82
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,850
Maybe it's because or posts
you sort of eaten up awards.

83
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,870
Charles,

84
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,030
I've cut that out.

85
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,000
Love you and we don't want to
think bad has happened to you.

86
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,893
Yes,

87
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,353
that's right.

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,571
Thank you.

89
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:05,404
Bye Bye.

90
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,133
Ooh.

91
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,583
Oh,

92
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,210
Brian Cowen was on the podcast today.

93
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:16,990
Ladies and gentlemen,

94
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,660
almost always the grands.

95
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,620
Podcasts of all time when the Brian Cowen,

96
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,910
Duncan Trussell,

97
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,350
Joe Diaz podcast,

98
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:23,741
that's the,

99
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:24,760
that's the deadly.

100
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,653
That's the

101
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,753
TRIFECTA.

102
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,360
Trifecta.

103
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,320
We call it the TRIFECTA.

104
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,340
The axis of evil.

105
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,220
That's the best I think
everybody should do.

106
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:35,490
Contobox is just doing a little
bit of actual really good.

107
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,251
I feel like a fucking man.

108
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:36,520
Right?

109
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,080
I feel like I just had
coffee or something.

110
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:38,914
Yeah.

111
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,851
I'm getting sick.

112
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:40,400
My neck.

113
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,921
I'm intimidated.

114
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,670
If you are intimidating guy,

115
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,803
what am I neck?

116
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,903
Scary.

117
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,690
Frightening to be this close
in proximity to a killer.

118
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,291
I like.

119
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:50,781
That's all I do.

120
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:52,180
The guys I know who are pro fighters,

121
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:52,911
I just,

122
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:53,281
I just,

123
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:54,630
I can't help it.

124
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,830
It's just an idiot.

125
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,090
But just like when you answer,

126
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:59,370
say if I'm here and I'm
like this and then I go,

127
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,480
hey,

128
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,150
like that,

129
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,870
what do you do?

130
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,703
I'll ask the question.

131
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,280
Nothing.

132
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,730
You fucking crumpling you learn,

133
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,580
want to learn how to fly or quite with
a bolster your key other than that.

134
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:09,820
Yeah.

135
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,480
Other than that,

136
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:10,771
uh,

137
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:10,950
it,

138
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,160
it doesn't really work.

139
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:12,880
And if it did,

140
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,660
people would be training in Kung Fu
when they stepped into the after guy.

141
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,930
A lot of guys go well,

142
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:17,980
but in real life,

143
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,200
if I'm hearing,

144
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:19,580
you know,

145
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,460
the funniest thing is when people say,

146
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:21,671
well,

147
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:22,091
hey bro,

148
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,500
you know what you do as a sport,

149
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,240
as a sports situation,

150
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,780
the best stuff works on trained killers
and the trained killers are the guys

151
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:31,700
like mayhem did Martha Vega,

152
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,380
there is one guy I know who,

153
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,860
who uh,

154
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,720
I think his name's Mark Makita and he,

155
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:35,930
uh,

156
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,590
he took a,

157
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,850
he's a knife fighter.

158
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,300
Like Katie teaches knife fighting
like on a high level and he goes,

159
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:42,070
he goes up.

160
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,140
He was talking about is an
important learning Jujitsu.

161
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,961
Absolutely.

162
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:46,420
Do you need to understand ground funding?

163
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:47,091
Do you see what I'm saying?

164
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:47,691
Kicking and punching.

165
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:48,021
Yes,

166
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:48,621
and he knows it all.

167
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,190
He goes,

168
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,431
he goes,

169
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:50,264
but you know,

170
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,200
I got out,

171
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,190
he pulled out a little,

172
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,260
he was like this and it was a
little hook thing like that.

173
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:54,531
And he goes,

174
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:55,364
see now this,

175
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,970
I can actually scribe
your spine from the front,

176
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:00,110
from the front.

177
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,920
And he goes,

178
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,180
see this year about eight inches,

179
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:02,930
you're in shape.

180
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,380
He goes,

181
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:03,891
see this?

182
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:05,000
I get in here and I'm,

183
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,270
I basically am bumping against
your spine and I pull here.

184
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,111
Then he goes this to me,

185
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:09,620
he goes,

186
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,770
see now we're in a fight here and you,

187
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:12,980
you throw a punch or whatever.

188
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:13,820
I catch you here.

189
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,250
What's hide?

190
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:14,481
I'm like,

191
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:14,930
that.

192
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,370
See,

193
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,240
like all you stabbing goes skivvy now
I take my knife and I cut all this soft

194
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:20,210
seat and I go,

195
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:20,811
oh.

196
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:21,231
And then he goes,

197
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:21,570
God,

198
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,230
I keep cutting and he's doing
this with this rubber knife.

199
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:24,950
And I was like,

200
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,611
that's what I was doing.

201
00:05:25,611 --> 00:05:26,211
You see that face?

202
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:26,910
I was going,

203
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,260
hello?

204
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,041
Like this game.

205
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:28,874
This is terribly goes.

206
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,150
Yeah,

207
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,560
that's real fighting this way.

208
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:30,890
He told me,

209
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,131
he said,

210
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,690
he's got this little hook
thing and he goes like this.

211
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:33,110
He goes,

212
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,180
see if I'm standing here like
that and you don't see you just,

213
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:35,320
you'd,

214
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,110
it looks like a,

215
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,891
I'm just holding things.

216
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:37,440
It looks like a,

217
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,600
like a key holder.

218
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,880
But if I come under here and pull this,

219
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,020
then your whole life,

220
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,560
someone screaming.

221
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:48,801
Yeah,

222
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:49,634
that's weird.

223
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,203
Stop filming.

224
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,730
Turns out those kids screaming
was just kids playing,

225
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,090
which is always good.

226
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,960
It's always good to be wrong.

227
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,960
Brian Killen was awesome
on the podcast and uh,

228
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,150
since we didn't really
end to end his interview,

229
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,313
we'll do it this way.

230
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,240
Powerful Thomas girl,

231
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:09,890
ladies and gentleman,

232
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,723
he's here

233
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,531
next week.

234
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,360
I start back on fear factor again.

235
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,470
Holy Shit.

236
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,400
That's ridiculous.

237
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,990
I can't even believe I agreed to do that.

238
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,340
I'm like a goddamn raccoon young,

239
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,800
something shining in front of my face.

240
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:22,131
And I said,

241
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:22,541
yes,

242
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,390
it's shiny.

243
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,820
It's going to be eating.

244
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,653
[inaudible].

245
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,060
I'm Joe Rogan and this is fear factor
and the stunts are about to see where all

246
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:34,400
design that supervised
by trained professionals.

247
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,240
They are extremely dangerous and should
not be attempted by anyone anywhere.

248
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,330
Anytime I remembered that and then
under any circumstances don't add shit

249
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:43,960
to me.

250
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,960
[inaudible] I said
[inaudible] want anywhere,

251
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,720
anytime.

252
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,690
That is any circumstances
you critique is like

253
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,223
what about this shit?

254
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,730
And then I have to say evidently
fear is not a factor for you.

255
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,080
Everything else is free ball.

256
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,870
You're going to get that back now people
are going to come and say that to you

257
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:06,261
again.

258
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:07,094
Now

259
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,681
again,

260
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:13,610
I've gone back to my post fear
factor days where everyone would get,

261
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:13,881
you know,

262
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:18,080
my boy wants needs more and that's
like your how many times have you heard

263
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:18,914
people say that?

264
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,690
No,

265
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,280
it's the [inaudible] as well.

266
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,350
It's going to make comedy
a little more interesting.

267
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,320
It's going to be old
heckles that are new again,

268
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:30,861
right?

269
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:31,694
Because it's

270
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,540
already got that shit right.

271
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,583
I'm already,

272
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,770
I'm already ready.

273
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,290
I'm ready.

274
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:37,870
Ready?

275
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,310
I don't.

276
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:38,990
I hope not,

277
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,860
but it probably will,

278
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,030
but I think it will survive.

279
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,380
The good thing about the podcast is the
podcast fans buy out the tickets before

280
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,520
the retards have a shot at it.

281
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,240
Right,

282
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,630
so that's what it's going
to keep them out of.

283
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,473
Clues.

284
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,760
Steps on stirrup.

285
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,060
We'll see you guys soon and soon.

286
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,800
There's a lot of shit going on.

287
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,140
Ah,

288
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,740
shit man.

289
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,573
A lot of shit happen.

290
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,430
Tommy Segura is going to go to
Montreal and we'll get a full fold.

291
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,580
The description of what happened there
when he comes back on his podcast,

292
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:08,720
which is your mom's house,

293
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:12,050
your mom's House on
desk squad and that TV.

294
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,340
You could find that shit on iTunes.

295
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,470
This might be the most boring fucking
post podcasts interview we've ever done.

296
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,340
This no fucking continuity to any of
the things we're saying where there's no

297
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:25,160
energy behind it when I have
a lot to offer you today,

298
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,000
but look,

299
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,830
there's cycles good and bad.

300
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:28,850
There's pro and con.

301
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:29,990
There's ebbs and flows.

302
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:31,310
The wave it comes in,

303
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,150
it goes out.

304
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,213
Can I,

305
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,151
oh,

306
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:37,070
this is the wrap up of the podcast.

307
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,120
We had a very fascinating podcast with
Giorgio from ancient aliens and of course

308
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,820
a good time as your bra.

309
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,070
Who is it to just satisfy your,

310
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:45,111
uh,

311
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:45,471
your,

312
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,420
your anxious knowledge alien thing?

313
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,401
Alex Jones.

314
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:50,390
I just want them to talk

315
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,450
when I told him that you were
coming on the podcast man site too,

316
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,580
I got to do this podcast with you.

317
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,990
I got to do this podcast with you.

318
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,500
I've got,

319
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,333
I've got to see this guy.

320
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,630
I got the questions for this guy,

321
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,920
but Nazis and aliens.

322
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,160
A lot of questions.

323
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,880
That was a good time is the
first podcast here we gun.

324
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:08,761
Are you going to what?

325
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,050
Let's just do this like this.

326
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:10,800
Yes.

327
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,150
But I've done a lot of over the phone

328
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,270
tweet that I'll read to it.

329
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,530
You've done a lot over the phone.

330
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah.

331
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,250
This is definitely more interesting
picture of US intimately,

332
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,084
right?

333
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,613
Yeah.

334
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,540
So this is the first time I've
ever done a podcast like this.

335
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,680
We'd get to go deep,

336
00:09:30,681 --> 00:09:30,951
deep,

337
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:32,330
deep into the crazy Ben.

338
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,841
Cause he,

339
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:33,281
I told you,

340
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,730
you broke my crazy meter with
the ark of the Covenant Day.

341
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,663
I love it.

342
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,780
It's never happened before.

343
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:40,180
I think that like,

344
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,401
listen,

345
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:41,234
the fuck is he saying?

346
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,250
He's saying it was a
fucking vending machine.

347
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,353
Yes.

348
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,830
An extraterrestrial one.

349
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:47,664
None of us.

350
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,140
It's pretty crazy stuff,

351
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:49,560
man.

352
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,560
What is it like living in your world is
overwhelmed by all this speculation and

353
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:01,620
crazy stuff and things that most
people will never take seriously,

354
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,460
but yet you're,

355
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,290
you've spent on incredible amount of
time invested in all these things.

356
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,550
What does that like man?

357
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,571
Well,

358
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:07,841
I mean,

359
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:08,051
look,

360
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:08,410
I,

361
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:08,690
I,

362
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,523
uh,

363
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,493
it's,

364
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:12,790
it's bizarre.

365
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,080
I mean,

366
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,110
I rarely,

367
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:16,630
I rarely go to conferences because,

368
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:20,710
because there's so much weird stuff
going on as it's even weird for me,

369
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,060
you know?

370
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,330
And,

371
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,163
and that's,

372
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,040
and that's the thing that,

373
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:24,401
you know,

374
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:25,330
I'm just some dude,

375
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:29,170
I'm just a regular guy and
the moment I hear about,

376
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,000
you know,

377
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,490
you know,

378
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,241
crazy,

379
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:32,410
crazy stuff to me,

380
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:32,831
it's like,

381
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,101
you know,

382
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,800
slow it down a second
here because this is,

383
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,170
how are you going to lose the mainstream?

384
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:43,030
Because just to talk about the
potential or the possibility at ets,

385
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:43,780
where here,

386
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,051
dude,

387
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:45,120
that's fucking enough.

388
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,113
That's enough.

389
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,800
That's enough.

390
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,633
You know and so,

391
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,940
so need vending machines for space.

392
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,660
What about [inaudible] possible?

393
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,430
You can't even put a dollar
billing between the fittings

394
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,183
about it.

395
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,790
Freddy Loc hard and I was just talking
about keeping the pimp hand strong.

396
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,930
He was just telling me how it keeps a
pimp hand strong and I got admitted some

397
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,900
high level shit.

398
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,280
He knows what the fuck he's doing done.

399
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,050
It's done.

400
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,640
It's done.

401
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,160
It's a man who's grown up with it.

402
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,460
Did,

403
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,870
did your dad have a strong compound?

404
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:19,471
Extremely.

405
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,370
It's still strong.

406
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,540
It works on me still.

407
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,050
Yeah.

408
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,841
So you could tell him,

409
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:23,041
man,

410
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:27,150
you understand the psychology
behind the pimp hand strong.

411
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:27,990
You need to let you know.

412
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:30,540
If you don't use the pen pen then things
get out of control and you can take an

413
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,460
advantage of the dazzling.

414
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:33,130
You're right.

415
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,860
You got to realize that
nature in this life.

416
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,950
And women want men and men want women and
occasionally a woman wants to be a man

417
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:43,510
and a man wants to be a woman
and that's a catastrophe.

418
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,580
And what a woman wants to be a man and
you're a man you usually submit because

419
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:50,320
she has the pussy and then
you know what I'm in anymore.

420
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,183
She's the math.

421
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,730
When someone's telling you what to
do with that person to the your man,

422
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,000
at least how your man a little
pussy and some companionship,

423
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,201
the only sound,

424
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:00,340
anything that's your happiness,

425
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,380
not your man that don't rely
on anybody for anything ever.

426
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,210
That's how public service
messages of the day.

427
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,530
Now that I'm back on NBC,

428
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,891
the whole,

429
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,390
you know,

430
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,300
keeps a pimp hand strong the more
you know like rainbows and shit.

431
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,480
My pants ready.

432
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,950
Lockhart Lockhart has a
brand new podcast folks.

433
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,870
For those of you who are
watching this video blog,

434
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,720
we don't actually listen to the podcast
cause you ain't got that kind of time.

435
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,830
I understand that you're out there a
Fetty Lockhart has a fantastic podcast

436
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:23,950
though.

437
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,430
If you ever,

438
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,300
I'm going to go on a trip.

439
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,111
You know what I'm saying?

440
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:26,740
I want to go somewhere.

441
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,110
Your needs.

442
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,671
Listen to something.

443
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:29,770
Your 11 hours on a plane Friday.

444
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:30,760
Lockhart's podcasts.

445
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,150
Perfect for such situations.

446
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:32,500
Yeah,

447
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,333
it's called what's good.

448
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,280
It's on the death squad label
can get on iTunes for free.

449
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,323
It's free.

450
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,351
If you don't like it,

451
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:39,130
you don't have to listen,

452
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:39,881
then tune in next week.

453
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:40,101
You know,

454
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:41,020
I thought I would delete that too.

455
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,933
He's a fuck.

456
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,833
I hope you'll,

457
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,110
I think you'll like it.

458
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,770
I hope so.

459
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,360
There's those who do and
those who haven't heard,

460
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,641
you know,

461
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:47,800
you don't even do guests yet.

462
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,890
Right now you're just like interacting
with people on Twitter and shit on

463
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,380
finding it.

464
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,900
We're finding the voice and then I think
I might start playing my own guests.

465
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,641
Maybe dude,

466
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:55,474
go back.

467
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,970
When we were doing our first podcast,

468
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,770
Brian and I started over a year ago,

469
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:00,430
year and a half ago.

470
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,270
It was terrible.

471
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:02,110
We were awful.

472
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,340
The first couple of podcasts
are unwatchable snowflakes
and we'll like reading

473
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:06,851
off Twitter.

474
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:07,684
What is he saying?

475
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,663
What is wrong with this guy?

476
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,091
We're like,

477
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:10,900
it was like so dumb and boring.

478
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,111
Yeah.

479
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:11,891
He let me know the first,

480
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:12,380
the second one,

481
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,330
cause I snuck in and Twitter.

482
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:16,570
So much as if you're listening to this
on your iPod a couple of days later,

483
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,100
this is not exciting.

484
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,121
So I was like,

485
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:19,271
yeah,

486
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:19,481
all right,

487
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:20,314
I'll leave to,

488
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,650
you know,

489
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,483
you've got to leave.

490
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,380
I think the third time we
just did it more relaxed.

491
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:25,690
The second time it was almost like it's
a radio show going to be professional.

492
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:26,471
But then the third time it's like,

493
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:26,711
yeah,

494
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:30,040
just shoot the shit and see where we
had one mistake that we did where we let

495
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:30,940
people in the chat room,

496
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,860
we let a chat room rather than we like
read the chat room and it's also like

497
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,500
nigger,

498
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,350
nigger kind craziness.

499
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,021
Fuck you fucking,

500
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:41,620
we'd have to ban this guy and this guy
would be spam and show me your cock.

501
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,600
Oh are so crazy.

502
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:44,020
They just,

503
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,400
they just want you to acknowledge them.

504
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,680
They want their name to be said.

505
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,270
Yes.

506
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,220
So we had to figure it out.

507
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:50,950
We had to figure out that you can't talk
to them and you're just going to kind

508
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:53,710
of do your own thing and you
got to listen to feedback.

509
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:55,030
You learn from some feedback,

510
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,200
but you gotta you know,

511
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:59,690
you also got to like insulate some
people for having an impact on the show.

512
00:13:59,760 --> 00:13:59,930
Nah,

513
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,040
there's no part of it.

514
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,820
That's the only God damn crazy.

515
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,800
It's so fascinating.

516
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,810
There's so many nutty
fucking people out there.

517
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,800
And uh,

518
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,270
when you have a podcast,

519
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,830
you could bring those
nutty people together.

520
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:12,970
Yeah.

521
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,170
The death squad label,

522
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,420
I ran into a guy in San
Diego of his lesson.

523
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,650
He was telling me everything about it.

524
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:19,230
Should I forgot about this?

525
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,410
The first one we did.

526
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,801
Oh Man.

527
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:21,251
People love it,

528
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:21,401
man.

529
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:22,390
It helps them get through their day.

530
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,950
Know if you have a boring ass job,

531
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,970
some shit during the day
while you're doing things.

532
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,560
Yes,

533
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,070
but it's making radio passe now isn't
that a buddy of mine emailed me,

534
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,120
said he went to a bar,

535
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:33,641
we went to a bar.

536
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:35,030
I think that there's
somewhere in the north east.

537
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,050
Went to a bar and in the inside the barn,

538
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:38,050
they were playing the podcast.

539
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,651
Oh Wow.

540
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:39,330
Speakers.

541
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,960
Why was it the ice house two weeks ago,

542
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:41,591
the bartender,

543
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:42,251
I went to go pay.

544
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:42,560
He goes,

545
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,110
I listened to on Joe Rogan's podcast.

546
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:46,050
They charge charging
your nothing's Freddy Loc

547
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,720
that strong ladies and gentlemen.

548
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:50,290
I mean,

549
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:50,900
boom.

550
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,733
Hey,

551
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,050
we're back with my friend,

552
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,880
formerly known as Chris now,

553
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:56,714
Aubrey,

554
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,770
what's going on?

555
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,870
It's so fucked up on Iowasca.

556
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:05,000
He changed his name and you can see
the whole story or listened to it or

557
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:05,834
whatever you want to do.

558
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,810
A podcast one,

559
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,880
one 27,

560
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,400
27.

561
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,710
Yeah,

562
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,041
whatever.

563
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:10,701
If you read about it,

564
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,460
I'm warrior poet,

565
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,310
a u s there you go read about it and
you can watch his videos on it and uh,

566
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,360
it's not for kids.

567
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,300
This is some real shit folks right out.

568
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,290
We just got started
doing the podcast and uh,

569
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,010
I think what I told him was that I
think it was the best depiction of the

570
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,930
Iowasca experience that I had ever heard.

571
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:30,860
The most detailed,

572
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:31,880
the most compelling,

573
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,260
the best story.

574
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
It was really,

575
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,270
you went in depth and you,

576
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,050
you did it without any worry
about how ridiculous the sounds.

577
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,100
He didn't apologize for any of it.

578
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:43,611
You just,

579
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:44,630
you just jumped in there.

580
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,040
It's easy when you're just
telling what happened.

581
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:47,701
You know what I'm saying?

582
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:48,780
It's like I didn't have to.

583
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,261
It is,

584
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:49,980
but it's not,

585
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,460
yeah.

586
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:50,641
Well,

587
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:51,510
maybe not how you do it,

588
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:52,470
but it's so,

589
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:52,801
I mean,

590
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,690
I didn't have to make anything up.

591
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,390
That's what happened to me out there.

592
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,760
So it sounds like
complete utter horse shit.

593
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,410
But yeah,

594
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:01,920
for sure.

595
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,710
It's just because it's
too crazy for our reality.

596
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:05,820
It's too crazy for our reality.

597
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:08,760
But that was the beauty of the way you
told it is that even though it sounds

598
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:10,710
like complete other wish it like on paper,

599
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,491
you know you're reading it,

600
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:12,480
you go what?

601
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,080
But the way you said it
was so sincere and so,

602
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,850
so honest and open about it.

603
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:18,301
Like you know,

604
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:19,420
just like this is what happened.

605
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,091
This is what I saw.

606
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:21,310
That's what I felt is what I experienced.

607
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,390
No apologies goes a very fascinating man.

608
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,860
I guarantee you it's a lot of people
listen to that and they're going to go and

609
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:29,630
try that shit.

610
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,463
I should up,

611
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,230
bro.

612
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,580
It can only benefit your life.

613
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,840
I mean if you go,

614
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,261
you know,

615
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:35,490
maybe I'll write a blog or something.

616
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:36,780
There's some basic things you learned.

617
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:37,530
Don't fight it.

618
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:37,801
You know,

619
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:39,000
don't try to fucking,

620
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,630
you know,

621
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,500
let things happen.

622
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,740
Let the medicine work and follow some
basic guidelines and it'll change your

623
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:44,450
life for the better.

624
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,350
And the guy you went with
that they called the Dragon,

625
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:46,890
the Dragon.

626
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,401
The Maestro.

627
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:47,780
Maestro.

628
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,120
Orlando's cure on Dama.

629
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,010
Yeah.

630
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,330
Do we need to get that dude on Twitter?

631
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,683
Oh yeah.

632
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,520
I watch him up.

633
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:53,800
You know,

634
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,890
he's got just to give you his number.

635
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,360
Learning.

636
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,660
Yeah.

637
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,090
Text him in touch with them by email.

638
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,420
But you've got to learn Spanish
cause it's a bit of an option.

639
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,690
All right.

640
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,250
Did the Rosetta stone get
all that shit son on it?

641
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,020
Alright,

642
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,220
we got to go to a movie premiere.

643
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,080
We're going to go see
Kevin Smith's red state.

644
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,200
Hopefully it's good.

645
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,400
Yeah,

646
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,861
I'm excited.

647
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,220
I love cat in a blaze up
and see what the fuck is up.

648
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,850
But thank you for tuning into the podcast
and the podcast video blog and we'll

649
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:14,181
see you soon.

650
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:14,361
Okay,

651
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:14,481
bye.

652
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:15,314
Bye.

653
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,870
[inaudible]

654
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,873
and um,

655
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,291
they're celebrities.

656
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,180
Cause I don't know if
you know this is America,

657
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,420
but are there actually the
guys who brought planking
to America fucking serious?

658
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:34,331
Yes.

659
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:34,751
So,

660
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:34,960
uh,

661
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,420
please welcome the very
talented Walsh brothers.

662
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:41,950
Hm.
