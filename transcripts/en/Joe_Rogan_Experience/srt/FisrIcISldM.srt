1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,700
Thank you.

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,770
You sugar over there.

3
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:02,843
No sugar.

4
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,730
We have a thing called Stevia natural.

5
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:06,564
Whereas it Ryan,

6
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,853
we're on

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,060
the Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:15,901
A boy,

9
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:16,501
Sam triple.

10
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,960
He got his first flashlight
today in his moy.

11
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,280
Excited though Christmas up in here.

12
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,350
It is like Chris don't put too
much of that stuff and that strong.

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,350
It's not sugar.

14
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,820
It's super healthy though,

15
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:27,600
man.

16
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,680
Super Healthy.

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,750
San Aaa first flashlight ever
today will be Christening it folks.

18
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:33,931
You know,

19
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:35,730
it's a silly product and people go,

20
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:35,911
well,

21
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,100
why do you have the flashlight
sponsoring your podcast?

22
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:38,641
Like,

23
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:39,510
what's up with that?

24
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,523
Like it's Kinda,

25
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,630
it's Kinda like why wouldn't you?

26
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,321
Well,

27
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:47,250
because I think people think that there's
something silly and there's something

28
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:48,990
where people are not going
to take you seriously,

29
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,431
you know,

30
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:52,140
you're admitting to
fucking some fake vagina,

31
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:52,980
you know?

32
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,211
But,

33
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:53,550
but,

34
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,271
but here's the thing,

35
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:57,120
I do shows and I have like
a sex toy company name,

36
00:00:57,121 --> 00:01:02,121
a fun factory does my live shows with me
and there they had the cadillacs of FEC

37
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,210
and vibrators and girls
go crazy over that issue.

38
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:05,940
He ever is.

39
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,920
Definitely a vibrator.

40
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,460
Girls are allowed to get vibrators.

41
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,340
Dudes are not allowed to have it before.

42
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,910
Like something that
smelled like a raft pop.

43
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,370
Yeah.

44
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,270
Those things are useless.

45
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:16,200
When fleshlight came along,

46
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,010
there was nothing else.

47
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,360
It's fucking good dude.

48
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,050
It's good.

49
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,431
I,

50
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:19,771
I,

51
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:20,130
uh,

52
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,330
have used it several times.

53
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,590
It's way better than beating off.

54
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,090
And that's like a weird thing to admit.

55
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:25,500
People don't admit that they masturbate.

56
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,110
My name is Joe Rogan and I masturbate.

57
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,800
So this podcast is brought to you by the
fleshlight because it's fucking solid

58
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:32,251
product,

59
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:32,700
man.

60
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,030
Alright.

61
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,620
Forget about all the what?

62
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,760
When I first moved down here,

63
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:38,280
I didn't masturbate or talk
about masturbation to anybody.

64
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:40,350
You're the first person from Ohio.

65
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,910
You're the first person that I remember.

66
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:43,320
You were always like talking about it.

67
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:43,560
I'm like,

68
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,490
I should talk about it.

69
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,210
And I remember I started talking about
masturbating and then now it's just like,

70
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:48,750
I do it every day.

71
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,410
There are definitely some
suppress people there.

72
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,253
You know?

73
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,861
How about everywhere,

74
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:53,071
man,

75
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:53,810
all over the country.

76
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,670
You know when you're just hanging
out with comedians now anyway,

77
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,630
if you go to Joe Rogan.net and click
on the link for the flashlight,

78
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,270
that was an extended commercial was great
commercial about it because I've taken

79
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,320
shit about this product.

80
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,340
People think it's ridiculous.

81
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,240
I used it the other day.

82
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,320
It's a good product.

83
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,950
God dammit.

84
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,910
There's literally given with it.

85
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:09,241
I don't.

86
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:10,480
I think people will.

87
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,790
Some people are not going to want to Zeus.

88
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,360
You associated with the flashlight.

89
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,783
Good.

90
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,350
Good.

91
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,490
Those eggshells.

92
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,300
Who knows?

93
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,780
Who knows?

94
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,150
I don't get that are
out there and they're.

95
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,880
They're the people that want
to stop occupy Wall Street.

96
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,780
If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on
the link and enter in the code and name

97
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:27,340
Rogan,

98
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,780
and you will get 15 percent off
the number one sex toy furman.

99
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,840
Sam Tripoli is also going to
get some Alpha brain today.

100
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,130
I'm very excited about.

101
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,140
We're also sponsored by Alpha brain.

102
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,550
If you go to [inaudible] dot com,

103
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,580
o n n I t a,

104
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,120
we have a bunch of products now.

105
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,440
We have Alpha brain and
then we have this new,

106
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:45,870
uh,

107
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,650
new mood knew mood is
a five htp supplement,

108
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,251
which,

109
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:50,441
uh,

110
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:52,080
I found out about that
shift from Neal Brennan,

111
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:54,180
but there's a bunch of different
things that you can do.

112
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:56,280
They're called nootropics
to tweak your mind.

113
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,031
And uh,

114
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:59,800
this Alpha brain thing has
not been without controversy.

115
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:00,640
I have to be honest.

116
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,050
There's people who love it.

117
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,360
And then there's people
who say it's a placebo.

118
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:05,350
It doesn't do shit.

119
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,190
I mean,

120
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,190
people have been taking these particular
nutrients like Coleen and a bunch of

121
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:12,820
different other ones were like,

122
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,500
they're referred to as nootropics.

123
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,540
They've been taking them for years.

124
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,710
And the idea behind it is that it
just makes you think a little clearer.

125
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,230
It's not this fucking Bradley Cooper,

126
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,070
limitless shit.

127
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,140
It's not going to make
you smart if you're dumb.

128
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,420
But I liked the way it affects me.

129
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,870
I take two every morning with
water and I believe in it.

130
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,441
And you know,

131
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:33,250
there's um,

132
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,540
there's a lot of
controversy about it though.

133
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,570
There's controversy about the science
behind it and we are doing the best to

134
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:38,890
clear up all that stuff.

135
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,660
We're going to release
a new document tonight.

136
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,290
I think it might already be up there on
on it for people who are concerned about

137
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,770
the amount of l Dopa in it
from a being the velvet bean,

138
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:48,071
actually,

139
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:49,390
it's an extract of food extract.

140
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,630
The idea behind all of this is that I
think the body works better when it's

141
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,280
supplemented with nutrients
with a lot of nutrients.

142
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,770
I think you work better
when you take fish oil.

143
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,420
There's a lot of controversy behind that.

144
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,680
I think your body works,

145
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:05,770
but I know my joints work better
when I take fish oil for sure.

146
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,410
No question about it because I
do a lot of really hard training.

147
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:11,620
I do Jujitsu and lift weights
and when I don't take fish oil,

148
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,930
I notice a difference
in how my joints feel.

149
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,091
Well,

150
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:17,220
you're fine tunes and fine
tuned instrument and uh,

151
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,100
I take vitamins,

152
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:21,510
I take multivitamins and take them
coital mineral drink everyday.

153
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,110
I do a lot of different drink,

154
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,970
a lot of fresh squeezed juices.

155
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,230
I'm very concerned with
keeping my body running at a,

156
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:28,720
at a,

157
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,310
at a good place,

158
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:30,821
you know,

159
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:34,540
keeping my body running
healthy and well fulfilled.

160
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,160
I always want to make sure
I get the right shit in it.

161
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,640
And when I take this stuff
and I take this alphabet,

162
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,180
I can definitely notice a difference.

163
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,560
This is like,

164
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,130
I don't know if everybody
can and I don't know,

165
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,630
maybe some people are just negative.

166
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:43,961
I don't know,

167
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:46,570
maybe some people's bodies are
just different because it's weird.

168
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,870
You get to the variations
are people love it.

169
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:50,710
It's changed like mayhem.

170
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:53,080
Miller is fucking in love with this stuff.

171
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,930
Do you think it's people that are just
not fine tuned to them themselves?

172
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,190
He could because there's another,

173
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,070
there's another product
that we're selling that uh,

174
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:00,341
you know,

175
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,810
it took me a while to be sold on.

176
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,520
It's based on the quarter steps mushroom,

177
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:07,330
it's called shroom tech and with a
quarter zips mushroom is a mushroom that

178
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:11,560
enhances your body's ability to
utilize oxygen and Olympic athletes.

179
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,840
And China used it and
won a bunch of metals.

180
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,800
And um,

181
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,140
this,

182
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,820
this mushroom is we've
known for free like many,

183
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:22,900
many hundreds of years that people in
Tibet and people in high high altitudes

184
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,870
will eat certain routes and certain
plants to make them feel better,

185
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:26,140
like,

186
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,420
you know,

187
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,920
in the Andes or were in Peru rather they,

188
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:30,460
um,

189
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,990
they chew cocoa leaves,

190
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,351
you know,

191
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:35,250
because they're like way up
high in the mountains and um,

192
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,621
you know,

193
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:35,831
they,

194
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:36,640
they figured out,

195
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:36,811
well,

196
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:38,620
what's the best nutrient
to help us up here?

197
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,861
Well,

198
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,150
it turns out it's fucking cocaine.

199
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:40,750
No,

200
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,351
that makes sense.

201
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:42,161
And the coca leaves.

202
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:42,700
Yeah.

203
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,240
But people have been taking
these extracts like velvet bean,

204
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:48,640
especially one of the
ingredients in Alpha brand.

205
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,400
They've been taking it for
thousands of years and it's,

206
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,990
if you think it's too expensive,

207
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:53,920
I totally understand.

208
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,560
We use the best ingredients
available and it's not cheap.

209
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,410
So what I would suggest you
do is go to the website.

210
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,760
If you're interested in nootropics,

211
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,091
first of all,

212
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:02,960
just read up on them.

213
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,010
The Internet is amazing,

214
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:04,490
right?

215
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,060
Just enter in the word neutral,

216
00:06:06,061 --> 00:06:07,520
big n o tropic.

217
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,460
And you know,

218
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,960
you find out so much information about
all the different compounds in different,

219
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,060
different ones that people offer,

220
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:14,841
not just Alpha brain,

221
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,510
there's a bunch of them on the market
and there's a bunch of different

222
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:21,320
individual ingredients that you can get
if you want to try this specific formula

223
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:23,900
that's an Alpha brain we
list on [inaudible] dot com.

224
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,150
Oh,

225
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,240
and it the exact ingredients.

226
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,860
So please just buy it in bulk.

227
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:28,970
If it's a budget issue,

228
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,180
buy it in bulk and try it and mix it up.

229
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:33,290
Find out what's good for you,

230
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,400
find out about other things,

231
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:37,160
run out about some of the other
nutrients that are available,

232
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:38,870
that enhanced cognitive function.

233
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,820
Just fuck around with it if you like to,

234
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,900
if you don't like to,

235
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:42,980
well not offended,

236
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:45,110
but it is a sponsor of the podcast.

237
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,500
And if you go to Joe Rogan.net and click
on the link for Alpha brain entering

238
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:49,430
the codename Rogan,

239
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,750
you will get 10 percent off.

240
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,100
A hotly debated issue.

241
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:52,341
Sam,

242
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:55,680
triple a lot of people have been giving
you are the fifty cents of podcast.

243
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,230
You're pushing product.

244
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,651
I am.

245
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,760
I am pushing a product,

246
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:00,230
but it's only products that I believe in.

247
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,350
I think the fleshlight is
awesome to fuck period.

248
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,980
Hope that pure like vitamin water where
you sell it and you got a piece and it's

249
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,360
worth.

250
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,120
I wish I had a piece of the flashlight
but they were already huge before I came

251
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:11,480
along.

252
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,070
But I have a piece of Alpha brain boom,

253
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,210
boom.

254
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,043
But I listen.

255
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,973
If I didn't,

256
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,850
I wouldn't say.

257
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,830
I mean if I,

258
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:19,430
if I didn't have a piece in it,

259
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:21,470
I wouldn't say anything different
than what I'm saying now.

260
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,540
This is something I believe in.

261
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,120
I might say it less because
I'm not trying to sell it,

262
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,780
but I would say the truth and if I didn't
believe in it I wouldn't be selling

263
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:29,841
it.

264
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:30,500
Period.

265
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:30,830
You know?

266
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,000
So think what you want.

267
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,020
Try what you like.

268
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,760
Don't be mean on the Internet though.

269
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,530
The troll.

270
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:36,711
Oh,

271
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:37,544
and by the way,

272
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,560
100 percent money back guarantee.

273
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,490
One hundred percent.

274
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,473
If at any,

275
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,030
in any,

276
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,130
anytime after you take it,

277
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,300
you're not satisfied.

278
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,230
I don't know how many days is for brain.

279
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,031
What is it?

280
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:48,050
Like 30 days or something like that,

281
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,800
15 days,

282
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,371
whatever it is,

283
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:53,290
it gives you a couple of weeks to take
it and you will feel some sort of an

284
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,260
effect fairly quick.

285
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:56,740
How many days you got a ticket
to feel an effect right away?

286
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,610
It took me about two weeks,

287
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,150
honestly.

288
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,030
I an effect to feel like I prefer a while.

289
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:03,560
It was like trying to figure it out,

290
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,410
buddy.

291
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,050
So out of Wack Dude with Sarah.

292
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,050
Wasn't that great?

293
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,210
Wasn't that immediate pussy.

294
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,020
It's like taking the condemned house
and throwing down on it and being like,

295
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:16,100
why don't I look better?

296
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:16,511
It's like,

297
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:19,520
it's like I want you to take the test
and let me know if you're the same as me

298
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:21,920
because I took two weeks to figure it out.

299
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:22,850
I look at our guts.

300
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:25,320
We have the same problems here,

301
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:26,154
so like,

302
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,931
you know what I'm saying?

303
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:27,890
I don't smoke cigarettes,

304
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:28,880
but we've got the same problem.

305
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:29,930
You should take a little time.

306
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,933
You might start to show.

307
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,510
You would start this motherfucker,

308
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,260
Sam Tripoli's the house live and crowd.

309
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,880
I was on Ted talk.

310
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,680
What we did was we just push product.

311
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,980
Joe Rogan podcast

312
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,290
can easily

313
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,680
one of the greatest
moments in my young life.

314
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,643
How'd that feel?

315
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,650
Fucking awesome.

316
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:56,280
I didn't know

317
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,670
it was going to say that when
Nick Diaz that that was so cool.

318
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,511
Laurie's dude.

319
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,560
I was in my glory's.

320
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,311
I was like,

321
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:02,611
oh,

322
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:04,320
this is fucking most awesome shit.

323
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:05,154
Ever.

324
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,630
That could be better than if he said,

325
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:06,941
hey,

326
00:09:06,941 --> 00:09:11,941
I am so excited about fucking your TV
show coming back like this is even better

327
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:12,721
at it now.

328
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:15,060
That's nothing and the
podcast is way better.

329
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,330
Yeah,

330
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,050
right.

331
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,831
What are you doing over there,

332
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:17,510
Brian?

333
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,570
You're going to sniff things.

334
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,250
Smoking Weirdo fucking
smelled it for some reason.

335
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:26,720
I don't know what Mike Pocket Brian's
going to be like when he's like 60.

336
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,040
What do you think is going
to have the same child?

337
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,490
Their sense of humor just like this,

338
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,830
but I did not realize I did that.

339
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,360
I know.

340
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,470
I have no idea why.

341
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,323
Just did that.

342
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,970
Because you tell so many
people to sniff yours at home.

343
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,400
No,

344
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,791
no,

345
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:39,960
I think it's just with new things.

346
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,100
I like smelling new things,

347
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:42,870
but I thought I do that.

348
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,680
I smelled things like getting a
new laptop or a video game system.

349
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:47,970
We'd take off that Styrofoam.

350
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:48,650
We go,

351
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:48,890
well,

352
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,050
I ate lobster last night and they give
you the little bib thing and you gotta

353
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,060
put it on,

354
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,590
you know,

355
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,440
it seems ridiculous,

356
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:58,500
but my little daughter wanted me to
put it on and I decided to smell it.

357
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,270
The Bib smelled gross.

358
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:00,530
Well,

359
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,860
it's plastic,

360
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,230
but like a weird plastic smell.

361
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,120
Not like the Macdonald Bibs or whatever.

362
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,520
Like throw away ones.

363
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,210
Yeah.

364
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:09,691
Really?

365
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:11,070
I am thinking of that age.

366
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,250
I would ever go near lobster.

367
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,980
Yeah,

368
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,671
because it's a kid.

369
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:15,660
It looks like a monster.

370
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:16,410
You don't want to go.

371
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,100
They need a octopus real fucking.

372
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,560
There's a.

373
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,770
there's the eat octopus doesn't to like.

374
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,220
No.

375
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,053
Oh my daughters.

376
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,361
I was like,

377
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:27,300
what optimism is that video?

378
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:27,661
I was like,

379
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,980
is that even fucking possible?

380
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,023
Lobsters.

381
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,100
There's a fucking pee.

382
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,973
There's a group of people,

383
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,581
believe it or not.

384
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:36,360
I called the lobster liberation
group and these motherfuckers,

385
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,470
they go out and they break into markets
and restaurants and they take the

386
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:43,140
lobsters out and they
release them in the wild.

387
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,070
Could you fucking imagine how dumb you
have to be to risk your freedom because

388
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:54,981
you will go to jail for this or for a
bunch of solace fucking bugs or how like

389
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,650
how like Kushy Kushy
your life must be that.

390
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:03,270
That's the problem that you want to solve
in the world of all the problems like

391
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,130
you must have your credit
cards must be paid off.

392
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,600
Your credit must be great.

393
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,230
You must be on some kind of salary from
your parents that you want to go save

394
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,660
little creature from like water.

395
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,321
It's weird.

396
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:13,741
Yeah,

397
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,710
and little creatures that
don't give a fuck about you,

398
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,480
that not only do they not
give a fuck about you,

399
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:18,700
they,

400
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,520
they're too stupid to feel pain,

401
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,090
but what about the thing about the
killer whale where they're like people,

402
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,080
that's what they wanted to say,

403
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:25,730
that they,

404
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,320
they should have the right to people
that killer whales are a completely

405
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,040
different animal.

406
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,411
You know,

407
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:32,070
you're now you're talking about something
where I'm probably agree with them.

408
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,440
I think what's going
on with killer whales,

409
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:38,070
killer whales are a super intelligent
life form that we can't understand and

410
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:39,610
because we can't understand them like,

411
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,000
well that's a category and getting a
fucking cage then a light going in cages.

412
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:46,200
They don't like being in those ponds.

413
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:48,540
They want to be in the goddamn ocean
and they're really attached to their

414
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,310
families and they steal them.

415
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,070
They steal them from their
fucking mothers when they're,

416
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,020
man,

417
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,140
this is really the most evil shit ever.

418
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:56,681
You know,

419
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:58,840
Dolphin Training and Orca training,

420
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,240
it might look cool because they're
jumping up to get their fish,

421
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,811
but guess what?

422
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:03,340
They have to jump up to get their fish.

423
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,750
You don't know how depressed they are.

424
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,390
You don't know how fucked it must
be to live that kind of a life.

425
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,500
It's like us getting abducted by aliens
and they put us in a really small

426
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,090
apartment complex with a pool and
we all kind of hang out at the pool,

427
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:16,781
you know?

428
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,150
And then that's exactly what
it's like for these dolphins.

429
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,301
So,

430
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:19,580
you know,

431
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,660
as for social world and
they can never have freedom,

432
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,180
they can never be free then in that sense,

433
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:27,820
I think often never over.

434
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:29,410
It's fucked up for life.

435
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,280
Yeah.

436
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,150
That's fucked up.

437
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,080
That's not cool.

438
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,290
I was thinking the other day
about how like I just got a dog,

439
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:35,950
you know,

440
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,410
it's my first responsibility
in a long time and uh,

441
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,100
I just watched his dog and all
it does is I'm basically can't.

442
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,870
It's like Kathy Griffin's assistant.

443
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:46,060
I just get ran by this dog constantly.

444
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,030
And algae does is eat
poop and eat herself out.

445
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,500
That's pretty much all my dog does.

446
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,640
Jesus stuff out all day,

447
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,330
all day.

448
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,610
It was done a little under a year,

449
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,473
little over a year.

450
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,980
And I'm like,

451
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:58,900
if aliens come and make us pet,

452
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,540
is this what I'm going to be able
to do it because that's not so bad.

453
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,730
Like I could just eat
and then suck myself off.

454
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,253
That's ridiculous.

455
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,741
First of all,

456
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:06,790
you can suck your own Dick.

457
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,720
I can try.

458
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,471
Second of all.

459
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:08,861
Really?

460
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:09,111
You don't.

461
00:13:09,111 --> 00:13:11,350
You don't want to have the
freedom to go as you choose.

462
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:12,220
That's ridiculous.

463
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,130
You don't know,

464
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:13,370
man,

465
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,180
number one thing that would drive you
the most craziest to know that your

466
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,390
existence is defined
by four walls forever.

467
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,740
That's a for a person.

468
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:21,640
That's maddening.

469
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,100
The person wants to experience new things,

470
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:26,230
is a natural thing to
check out new movies,

471
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,940
go down to a new restaurant,

472
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:28,211
you know,

473
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:28,570
go,

474
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,310
go drive through a new neighborhood.

475
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,660
It's part of what we are.

476
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,220
We like to explore things.

477
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:34,000
We're curious.

478
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
You tell a person and this is
all you're going to see this,

479
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,050
the only input you're
going to get forever.

480
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,700
They'll go fucking crazy.

481
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,530
It was what we're doing in those dolphins.

482
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,030
That's what we're doing in those orchids.

483
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,150
We just assume that because they
can't alter their environment,

484
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:47,890
that they can't be as intelligent as us,

485
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,840
but they could be a matter of fact,

486
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:53,320
the cerebral cortex of an ORC is like
40 percent larger than that of a human

487
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:53,890
being,

488
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,551
so we don't know.

489
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:57,190
We don't know if that's because it has
to manipulate this really super large

490
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:00,190
body because we do know that
neanderthals were dumber than people,

491
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,330
but they had bigger brains.

492
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:01,950
You know,

493
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,530
so it might have been just too,

494
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,040
because neanderthals had
basically like superhero bodies.

495
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,540
They were like an anatomic,

496
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,021
like five,

497
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:08,441
three,

498
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:11,230
200 fucking pounds of
solid muscle with these.

499
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,150
It's crazy bone structure like a chimp,

500
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:13,931
but you don't know.

501
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:14,231
Maybe,

502
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:14,711
maybe that,

503
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:15,220
you know,

504
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,070
I mean they could be as smart
because they were starting from less.

505
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:18,904
Do you know what I'm saying?

506
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,660
Like we're farther along in the past so
we're dealing with more complex shit.

507
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,860
But you had to start at the simple
thought and then build on that.

508
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:30,370
Over time you may have just had
the same kind of ability to think,

509
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,700
but you have to start at nothing
and build that something.

510
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:34,570
Do you understand what I'm saying?

511
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,380
We don't quite know whether or not
neanderthals were making tools before they

512
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:40,240
learned them from Homo sapiens either.

513
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:41,074
They don't know.

514
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,830
There's a lot.

515
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,180
I think there's a lot of debate on that.

516
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:46,570
I think they think that the homosapiens
just fucking basically wiped them out.

517
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,070
We were just too clever,

518
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,720
but that might be wrong.

519
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,290
Who knows?

520
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,640
I mean maybe they were about it.

521
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,030
What if

522
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,980
one of their cell phones,

523
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,410
they send a grated from that long?

524
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,370
That's a good point.

525
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:55,910
What if,

526
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,640
what if their heads were that big because
they were looking on their screens so

527
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:01,820
much and the Internet made their head's
bigger and then they all got wiped out

528
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:02,241
and died.

529
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:04,910
And you really think that there could
have possibly been an internet at some

530
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:05,630
point in the past?

531
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,280
Yes,

532
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,770
I think so.

533
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,210
Definitely 100 percent.

534
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:08,720
Really?

535
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,290
I think so.

536
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,320
How many thousands of years ago do
you think it would have to have six?

537
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:12,570
No,

538
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,403
I'm just kidding.

539
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:15,770
I mean,

540
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,180
but,

541
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,610
but based on what this is,

542
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,820
30,000 years ago.

543
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,371
Yeah.

544
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:22,230
So you got to go way back because six,

545
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:24,720
we know we go to six and we know like,

546
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,700
they know that a Sumerian text they know,

547
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:27,930
uh,

548
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,280
they wrote the tuner form.

549
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,233
It's just weird.

550
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,140
It looks like little,

551
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:31,590
um,

552
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,910
like nails,

553
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:33,481
you know,

554
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:36,360
like old nails ever see how an old nails,

555
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:38,460
not like a straight line
with a flat top on it,

556
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,590
but it's almost like
the whole piece is like,

557
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,221
you know,

558
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:43,230
angled and that's what
they're like writing,

559
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:43,681
look like,

560
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:44,700
look like old nails,

561
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,050
like sideways and upside down.

562
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,590
It really weird fucking crazy language
when you think about it because it was

563
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:54,591
all basically most of the same characters
just reused in some weird order that

564
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:57,390
they understood and they
had come to agree on.

565
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,720
And so we had to sort of decipher
that because it's a dead language.

566
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,160
We don't even know what it sounds like,

567
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:02,701
you know,

568
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:04,350
like no one talks it so they,

569
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,000
they know of the Sumerians wrote,

570
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,451
although it's,

571
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:10,230
a lot of it is under debate because of
there's a guy named Zechariah switching.

572
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,280
You've probably heard about him.

573
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:14,290
I wouldn't trust anyone named
Zechariah who was a bad motherfucker,

574
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,270
but he was never.

575
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,830
He was a believer and he believed that
the Sumerian texts was all about the

576
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:20,521
Annunaki,

577
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,930
which is a an alien race from another
planet that came down here that isn't an

578
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:25,860
elliptical orbit,

579
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:26,310
this planet,

580
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,091
every 3000,

581
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:32,091
600 years and that they came down here
to get humans and they created us from

582
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:34,260
lower hominids by adding their DNA.

583
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,950
This is all like
supposedly in the scenario

584
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,780
I don't have.

585
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,291
You know what man,

586
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,460
when they talk about angels,

587
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:39,570
you never know man.

588
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,700
There could be some
crazy shit coming down.

589
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,241
You know what?

590
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:42,580
I think

591
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,440
a lot of it probably is
what Brian is saying.

592
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,990
A lot of it probably is 30,000 years ago,

593
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:47,621
not six,

594
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:48,790
but 30,000 years ago,

595
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,890
there was like a super
fucking advanced civilization.

596
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:54,100
They'd reached the heights that
we've reached and what happened?

597
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:54,870
Who knows

598
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,410
if someone came in his answer,

599
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,210
I think there are way past us and then
they invented something that's still with

600
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:02,220
us that we just don't
know even know about yet.

601
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,521
You know,

602
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,160
like they like,

603
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,993
like they,

604
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:09,070
they invaded like air that could a heel
and send information or something like

605
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,220
that.

606
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,740
And we haven't turned into it
once we figured out a machine.

607
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,310
Yeah,

608
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,300
I believe in that.

609
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:15,601
Yeah.

610
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,560
And it's like the Internet.

611
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:18,740
It's like the version of
the Internet now look,

612
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:18,881
well,

613
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:21,630
you could never have explained the
Internet to somebody 50 years ago.

614
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,380
That's nothing you ever looked at the
old videos when they try to explain

615
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:27,120
computers like in the eighties,

616
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:28,771
you know what,

617
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:31,920
what was the thing that they used
to use back in the wild west days?

618
00:17:31,921 --> 00:17:35,130
Remember de de de de de de Morse code.

619
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:35,401
And that,

620
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,200
what they used back in
the old wild west days?

621
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,590
No,

622
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,161
it was called.

623
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:38,791
What was it called?

624
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,051
Um,

625
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:39,270
it was,

626
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,120
it wasn't called Mars.

627
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,380
You could troll someone
so easy on Morris Code.

628
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,570
They'd have no idea it was you,

629
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,091
you know,

630
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:46,050
it sounds like facebook.

631
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:46,890
Or let me see your picture.

632
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,870
Take a picture right now
of you and put it on your

633
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,821
is what I want you to do.

634
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:51,720
Want you to wear red,

635
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:52,800
white and blue socks on.

636
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,570
Old people talk more

637
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,330
imagined back then telling people that
you're going to be able to watch people

638
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,590
fuck on your phone.

639
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,401
So look at that,

640
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:03,090
see my phone,

641
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,440
I can watch people fuck on this.

642
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,770
It will be mind blowing.

643
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,900
You watched me go fuck on it.

644
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:08,700
It's streams and perfect time.

645
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,730
So yeah,

646
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,160
I mean like just to quantum leap,

647
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,461
I can't,

648
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:13,620
I can't imagine what's
going to be in 10 years.

649
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,390
In 20 years the real,

650
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:15,631
you know,

651
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:20,631
there's people that have a real scientific
be scientifically based theory that

652
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,770
the entire world that we live in is like
a computer simulation and there's like,

653
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,150
you know,

654
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,640
when they start getting into
quantum theory and you know,

655
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,790
I don't understand quantum physics
and Richard Feynman said it best.

656
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:33,061
He said,

657
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:34,620
if you think you
understand quantum physics,

658
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:38,130
you don't understand quantum physics
because even the scientists don't really,

659
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:38,370
they're,

660
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,600
they're still like a lot.

661
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,300
It just violates all these laws.

662
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:45,330
Like there's things like a particle and
being superposition where it's moving

663
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:48,930
and still at the same time and they can
appear in more than one place at the

664
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:50,820
same time and disappear
and they literally,

665
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,930
the particles disappeared.

666
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,160
We don't know where the fuck they go.

667
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:56,040
They go away and then they
come back and on top of that,

668
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,140
particles seem to be interacting with
each other despite no matter how long the

669
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,520
distances between them,

670
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,780
they seem to be able to automatically
like instantaneously interact with each

671
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:06,871
other.

672
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:07,690
That's crazy.

673
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:07,921
There.

674
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:10,260
They can interact quicker than
the speed of light apparently.

675
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:10,710
So it's.

676
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,520
So it's.

677
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,090
I can't even talk about it because
I'm not exactly sure what I'm saying.

678
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:15,660
It's like,

679
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,470
to me it's like what I'm saying is like,

680
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,290
it's like if you taught me how
to say something in French,

681
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,420
but I don't know what it means
and if you're like xenophobic,

682
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,030
why Misha and then I
just replete the noises,

683
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,870
but I don't know what I'm saying.

684
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,580
That's what I'm saying right
now what I'm talking about this,

685
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,811
you know it's there,

686
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:29,190
but you're not quite
sure what you're saying.

687
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,220
But the bottom line is it's so strange
and so bizarre and so not something that

688
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:36,541
you can bang on.

689
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,320
So not what we're used to in this
world that really literally anything is

690
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:40,801
possible.

691
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:41,030
This,

692
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,390
this,

693
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,130
this may very well be
a computer simulation.

694
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,371
Well,

695
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:46,380
going back to that
computer simulation thing,

696
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,410
that scene in the matrix is
kind of what that's about.

697
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:54,411
Do you know where like neo neo meets
like the creator and he talks about how

698
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:59,640
like he's the eighth one or the 11th
one and he's reacting different than all

699
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:00,474
the other ones.

700
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,840
That's kind of what that's about
and that no matter what happens,

701
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,920
people react the same way to stimulate
and you hear that a lot about when they

702
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:08,401
talk about,

703
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:08,920
you know,

704
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,211
uh,

705
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:10,500
the Illuminati or whatever,

706
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,670
when they're trying to do a,

707
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,170
they do certain things and see how people
will react over time so that when they

708
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:17,760
want to cause something to happen,

709
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,690
they know the exact reaction of what
people mean when they crashed the economy.

710
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,370
They want to see how people react,

711
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:24,150
all that stuff.

712
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,340
And that was the scene in
the matrix where he's like,

713
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,360
you're reacting different than the last
seven guys have because it's no matter

714
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:31,230
what happens,

715
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,030
people are going to do the same thing.

716
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,260
We act like we're different.

717
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,600
And that's a whole thing
from talking like your stone.

718
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:37,321
You're not even a stone.

719
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,154
This is crazy.

720
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,390
That's what that old saying.

721
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:39,660
Yeah,

722
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,160
that's what he's saying.

723
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,461
Yeah.

724
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:42,294
He's just.

725
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,150
Yeah.

726
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,250
We don't understand what I'm saying.

727
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:45,080
I'm not making sense.

728
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,680
You connected a couple of things
together that I'm baffled by.

729
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,160
I don't know

730
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,210
the scene in the matrix.

731
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,580
I think I might be on the wrong scene.

732
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,980
Explained to me there's a
scene where he walks in.

733
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,240
This is the first matrix.

734
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:55,451
No,

735
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:56,620
this is like the second,

736
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,813
third possible.

737
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,740
Why cut off after the first?

738
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:00,790
No,

739
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,090
you have to go back and watch
those without the emotions.

740
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,470
It's so much better.

741
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,700
Without the expectations.

742
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,770
The emotions of this is going to be great.

743
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:10,300
This is going to be the
greatest movie ever.

744
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,250
You put too much,

745
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:11,530
uh,

746
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,360
too much into it and then you're like,

747
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:14,740
it doesn't live up to your expectations,

748
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,090
but without those expectations,

749
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:18,410
it's actually a great
movie in the maximum here.

750
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:18,971
Here's what it is,

751
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:19,420
buddy.

752
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,070
There was one really good movie
and then the next one sucked.

753
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,600
I like the first and second one.

754
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,130
I thought the third one was okay.

755
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:29,520
Just that one scene was
the only problem I have.

756
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,610
Watch them again.

757
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,250
So,

758
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,340
so what are you saying it yet?

759
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,100
What do you say?

760
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,100
So neo walks into this room and he meets
the creator of the Matrix and the guy

761
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:40,600
says that the,

762
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:45,130
based upon the neos reaction to what he's
saying is that he's different than the

763
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,083
rest.

764
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,230
And basically what he's saying
is that the human beings,

765
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:53,430
they keep resetting everything
because they keep getting freewill.

766
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
They keep fighting back
against the matrix.

767
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,570
So they reset everything and
everyone reacts the same way.

768
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:03,040
They reset it and it becomes
another computer program and he act,

769
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,620
he acting different
than all the past ones.

770
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,150
His emotions are different.

771
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:08,440
So that's what I'm trying to say.

772
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,900
And then I've read books
about how like these guides,

773
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,700
the Illuminati or whatever
you want to call them,

774
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,980
who supposedly running
the country and the,

775
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:15,910
you know,

776
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,080
they opened the Federal Reserve and
stuff like that from the Federal Reserve.

777
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,500
They created the Federal Reserve.

778
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:21,334
Sorry about that.

779
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,790
That,

780
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,240
you know,

781
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,631
that is,

782
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:24,700
that's like one was listening
to Magic Johnson today.

783
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,100
Uh,

784
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,871
and he was in,

785
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:29,590
they were replaying his whole speech
about catching the HIV and he used the

786
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:33,090
wrong words instead of contract says,

787
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,720
I have a penis,

788
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,970
I forget what word you.

789
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,380
I'm like,

790
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:36,530
Oh,

791
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,500
a speechmaker must have
gotten pissed right there.

792
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,450
But back to what I was saying that they,

793
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,050
they do certain things where they just
see what the reaction of people will will

794
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:44,770
be over time.

795
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,110
You should see that movie multiple times
and every time you see it you get into

796
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,150
some emotion to it and become a what a
mind fuck it would be if you went to a

797
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:54,400
movie and you know,

798
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:58,300
like maybe the glitch in the computer
program was that when you went to see the

799
00:22:58,301 --> 00:22:59,260
movie the second time,

800
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,390
there was a scene in that
wasn't there the first time.

801
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,591
Oh that's cool.

802
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:03,580
And you're like,

803
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:03,971
wait a minute,

804
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:04,470
what,

805
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,530
what the fuck is going on?

806
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:05,770
No,

807
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,640
the movie ends,

808
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,210
but it's different and you,

809
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,650
you're,

810
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,420
it's a mind fuck because you're like,

811
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:10,931
God damn,

812
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:11,770
I don't remember that.

813
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,100
And the people on the other end like,

814
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,020
shit,

815
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,390
I don't think that fucking
scene was in the movie.

816
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,650
I don't think we showed them that.

817
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,300
I think we showed him
the first version of it.

818
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,290
Fuck.

819
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,570
So this poor guy has got
to like wander through,

820
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,100
try to figure out if this going insane.

821
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,680
Imagine if that's what it was.

822
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,890
Insane people are,

823
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,450
it's their program,

824
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:29,051
their program,

825
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:31,400
the one that they're living
in has a crazy glitch in it.

826
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,950
It's just some glitch.

827
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,780
So just wandering around.

828
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,030
They're all fucked up and homeless.

829
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,800
They're trying to explain
the fucking things.

830
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:41,080
Did you see that video that everyone's
got on reddit and they're going after

831
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:42,850
this kid in Chicago because he,

832
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:43,030
uh,

833
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,070
he punched this old homeless man
in the head and knocked him out

834
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,730
on video.

835
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,240
Yeah.

836
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,140
And then they were laughing about it.

837
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:48,974
And you see this,

838
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,450
the whole Internet is going after this
kid because it's one of the cruelest,

839
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:54,141
nastiest,

840
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:58,070
meanest fucking things I've ever
seen someone do to an old man who,

841
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:58,963
a homeless guy.

842
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,020
And he's broke and he's
asking people for a young kid,

843
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,470
17,

844
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:03,861
18,

845
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,060
maybe it looks like your kid,

846
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:05,301
you know,

847
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:05,661
I don't know,

848
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:06,430
it could be 20,

849
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,263
it looks like a kid.

850
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,090
And uh,

851
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,691
he is,

852
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:08,960
uh,

853
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,920
they're all standing there and this poor
guy is like old and rickety and barely

854
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:13,580
walk.

855
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,580
And the gates of the train opened the
doors to train open and he says something

856
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:19,700
to the old man like,

857
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:20,540
you want some change?

858
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,813
Oh.

859
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,690
And hits him full blast.

860
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,820
And the old man goes backwards and
balances his fucking head off the cement

861
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,271
easily.

862
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:30,620
Could be dead easily,

863
00:24:30,621 --> 00:24:31,454
could be dead.

864
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:31,911
You know,

865
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:32,270
I,

866
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,260
people die like that.

867
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:37,250
I had a friend who was working in a bar
and one of the bouncers punched him on

868
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:37,731
that lightly.

869
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:38,271
Same thing,

870
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:39,410
fell back on his head dead.

871
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,730
It happens all the time.

872
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,030
You're getting hit by the fucking
world thinking about what's happening.

873
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,020
The world,

874
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,080
the concrete concrete behind the
world is hitting you in the head.

875
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,400
That's really what it's like.

876
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,000
I mean,

877
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,191
it's,

878
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:50,880
it's,

879
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,390
that's an amazing amount of blunt force.

880
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,040
Your fucking son stop.

881
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,630
And this kid just started laughing and
they hopped on the train and drove away

882
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,800
and they're all laughing about,

883
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,880
oh shit.

884
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,773
He was

885
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,620
just laughing and laughing and laughing.

886
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,750
The most heartless crew.

887
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,550
It was so disheartening,

888
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:10,851
man,

889
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:12,470
that someone could be like that,

890
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:16,700
that someone could want to do that to
someone for no fucking reason whatsoever.

891
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,151
Yeah.

892
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:19,850
I don't give a fuck of you're 15 or 16,

893
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,900
you want to do that,

894
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:21,380
man,

895
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,510
fuck you.

896
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,423
But you know,

897
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,160
it goes back to this whole thing that
sometimes people don't get the discipline

898
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,610
when they're young and sometimes that's
like spanking or stuff like that where

899
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:34,890
they don't realize the pain that comes,

900
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,560
you know,

901
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,250
it's almost like bill burrs bit about
how like chicks mess with people because

902
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:41,750
no one's ever popped them before.

903
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,670
So they video games and porn,

904
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,570
right?

905
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,770
It's just like they don't get it.

906
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,000
So he said that about women.

907
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:50,390
I've been with women where women want
to start fights and that was a fuck you,

908
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,980
you fucking shut your fucking mouth.

909
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:52,551
And you're like,

910
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:52,971
whoa,

911
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:53,301
whoa,

912
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:53,631
whoa.

913
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:54,740
What the fuck are you doing?

914
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:55,580
Why are you with me?

915
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:57,830
And you're yelling at a
dude's stop this right now.

916
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,760
What are we going to do it?

917
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,410
You gotta you gotTa beat that guy's ass.

918
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:00,621
No,

919
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:01,700
you're going to get me shot.

920
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:02,601
That's what you gonna do.

921
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:03,700
Stupid ones.

922
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,670
Craziness.

923
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,451
One hundred percent.

924
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:07,340
I saw a video like the
one you're describing,

925
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,680
it was on television was some.

926
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,970
I don't know what the show was,

927
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:12,900
but they're showing it and
it was this really old guy.

928
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:13,910
He's about 75.

929
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,810
He's trying.

930
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,580
He is cars right next to this group of
like kids talking and he goes to his car.

931
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:20,390
He's trying to get in.

932
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,060
This other kid comes up and
just starts wailing on this.

933
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,260
This old man,

934
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:24,770
dude,

935
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,580
boom.

936
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,680
All the other people are
just standing there watching.

937
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,581
The guy gets in,

938
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:31,940
his car drives off and the guy just
laying down all of his friends,

939
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,610
just all the guys who are
watching just walk off,

940
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,710
a stranger has to come up and help them.

941
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:37,011
I'm like,

942
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:38,550
so what's the motivation behind this?

943
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,393
Just no motivation.

944
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,700
Stealing his car.

945
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,440
She's crushed.

946
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
It's like it's all people,

947
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:44,514
man.

948
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,510
It's a free shot.

949
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,360
It's free shot at people that feel like
they have no friends and they have no

950
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:51,060
one who loves them and no one gives a
fuck about them and they'll just take a

951
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:52,230
free shot at some old person,

952
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:52,471
man.

953
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:53,304
Fuck it.

954
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:53,880
It's a,

955
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,310
it's,

956
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,470
it's a dark,

957
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:55,801
dark,

958
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:58,080
dark part of human nature,

959
00:26:58,081 --> 00:26:58,420
man.

960
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,140
The need to pick on people
that need to fuck with people,

961
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,530
you know.

962
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,990
And that's something that we
really have to teach our kids.

963
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:04,560
Man.

964
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:04,801
You know,

965
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:07,170
the bullying in schools
has gotten worse and worse.

966
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:07,501
Man,

967
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:07,711
it's,

968
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:08,190
you know,

969
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,490
people are bullying people and then taking
the pictures and putting them online.

970
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:11,880
You know,

971
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,110
I saw this picture of this girl,

972
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:14,370
she blacked out at a party.

973
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,130
She got drunk,

974
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:15,510
says dude,

975
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,980
shit on her face.

976
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,630
Oh Shit on her face.

977
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,640
Took pictures of it
and then put it online.

978
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:21,960
It's horrible.

979
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:23,280
She's just cute little cheerleader,

980
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:23,761
you know,

981
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:24,311
it's really hard.

982
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:24,431
Well,

983
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:25,080
it's funny.

984
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,770
It is funny,

985
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,061
but it's,

986
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:26,681
it's horrible.

987
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:27,511
And that's someone's daughter.

988
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:30,330
Man was a little baby
for the rest of her life.

989
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,080
She recognize that.

990
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:32,550
Are you.

991
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,820
The girl got shit on the fate.

992
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,180
I mean,

993
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,590
it's like,

994
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,041
exactly,

995
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:35,851
and I can laugh at it,

996
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:36,660
but pictures.

997
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,100
She had a piece of shit on her mouth.

998
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,390
It's got shit on her mouth.

999
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,560
It's horrible.

1000
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,670
Is there no one there going?

1001
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:42,420
What are you doing?

1002
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:42,800
Yeah.

1003
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,050
Yeah.

1004
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,540
It's not.

1005
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,371
That's not that funny.

1006
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,204
You don't do that too.

1007
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:45,900
It was a dude.

1008
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,740
It would be way funnier,

1009
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:48,120
but doing it to a cute little girl.

1010
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,720
It's like,

1011
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,291
come on man.

1012
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,124
Why you doing that?

1013
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,270
So this was a little girl.

1014
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,660
Yeah.

1015
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,471
And she's a little girl.

1016
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,320
She's drinking.

1017
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:53,701
It's like,

1018
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:54,534
why are you shitting on?

1019
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,770
Where's your boyfriend?

1020
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,880
Where somebody's boyfriend.

1021
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:57,714
She didn't have a boyfriend.

1022
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,400
I guess they were drinking.

1023
00:27:59,401 --> 00:27:59,750
You know,

1024
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,700
should it gets crazy you.

1025
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,070
Especially when you're 17,

1026
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:02,371
18,

1027
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:03,061
whatever the hell she is,

1028
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,020
you don't know what the hell you're doing.

1029
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,180
But I have this thing
with the bullies to man.

1030
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:07,180
It's just like I,

1031
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:07,870
I,

1032
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,380
I understand the whole move to
stop bullying and it's true.

1033
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,450
But I have this thing where
you got to understand it.

1034
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:17,070
Some of these bullies also are rarely
hurt children and they come from bad

1035
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:17,910
situations.

1036
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,790
So it's like,

1037
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,890
I'm not saying,

1038
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,401
Hey,

1039
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:20,820
you know,

1040
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,960
let's not stop bullying,

1041
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,440
let's,

1042
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,981
I don't want,

1043
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:27,870
I hate when adults put their issues
on children and because a lot of these

1044
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:29,310
adults got bullied in high school,

1045
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:31,050
they want to go back and clean it up.

1046
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,710
But you got to understand that these
kids have social issues and mental issues

1047
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:35,160
too,

1048
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,090
that you don't want to.

1049
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,220
You don't want to tag them with something,

1050
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:42,260
some kind of police record that's going
to screw their whole rest of life up

1051
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,440
though the rest of their life up.

1052
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:43,830
So.

1053
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,150
But you have to protect her,

1054
00:28:45,151 --> 00:28:45,870
the other students,

1055
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,400
100 percent of the other students.

1056
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:48,151
And you've got to figure out,

1057
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:48,410
you know,

1058
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:53,220
the real issue is parents that do a
terrible job of raising kids are never

1059
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:54,060
penalized for it.

1060
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:54,710
You know,

1061
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,710
you never get in trouble.

1062
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,011
You know,

1063
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:58,800
you can do a terrible job of driving
your car and you can get tickets.

1064
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,371
You know,

1065
00:28:59,371 --> 00:28:59,850
you don't.

1066
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,190
Nothing happens when you raise a shit kid.

1067
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,200
Your kid could be a
God damn serial killer.

1068
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,660
My dog got sound bites.

1069
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,830
Someone I get sued 100 percent.

1070
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,820
I'm going to go to jail,

1071
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:09,750
I got a bad dog,

1072
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,180
but if you have a kid and your
kid goes out and kill somebody,

1073
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,980
you're not even somehow
responsible for it.

1074
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,050
That tried to do that for a while.

1075
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,230
Then there was this big
bash backlash against Moses.

1076
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,920
There was something where like the
this one area and I honestly Chicago,

1077
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:27,060
but I'm not 100 percent sure that they
were going to try to do something where

1078
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:30,120
parents were going to be held
accountable for their children's actions.

1079
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:31,050
It doesn't surprise me.

1080
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,970
You kind of should be in some way,

1081
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,570
you know,

1082
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,110
I mean,

1083
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,310
not entirely named me,

1084
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,270
but can.

1085
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,310
You never know what happens
once the kid leaves the nest.

1086
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,031
You know,

1087
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:41,680
and what if the kid has a
predilection for addiction?

1088
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:42,070
You know what,

1089
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,290
if the kid has got that wacky gene,

1090
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,380
they can't drink cough syrup
or fucking goes on a bender,

1091
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:47,741
you know,

1092
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:49,010
and that is a real gene man.

1093
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,260
I think you and I have both seen it.

1094
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,330
We all in the comedy world especially,

1095
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:54,640
we know a lot of wacky
people that can't smoke.

1096
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:56,050
A joint camp can have a drink,

1097
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,650
can't do it,

1098
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,431
can't do it.

1099
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:58,420
I don't care what you say.

1100
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,320
Everyone's different man.

1101
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,100
You know,

1102
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,000
I have my own problems
with that stuff and uh,

1103
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,411
you know,

1104
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:03,230
it's just,

1105
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:03,440
you know,

1106
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,720
it's like in my family,

1107
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,190
they have different forms of it,

1108
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:06,881
you know what I'm saying?

1109
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:08,290
Everyone's got their own kind of little.

1110
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,120
They're little vice and I,

1111
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:10,431
you know,

1112
00:30:10,431 --> 00:30:12,070
I have my advice too and I just,

1113
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,290
it's just I'm all or nothing type of guy.

1114
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:14,650
Well,

1115
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,210
I have a very similar personality,

1116
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:17,260
but it's not with substances.

1117
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,710
Luckily I take time off
of weed all the time.

1118
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:21,850
I'll take a couple of weeks off.

1119
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,160
Doesn't,

1120
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,993
it doesn't bother me at all.

1121
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,790
I'd never feel the need to drink coffee
is the only thing that I've ever been

1122
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:32,140
convinced that I was addicted to because
I took off once when I was writing,

1123
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,750
I was writing right before
I did my last special.

1124
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,340
I was for every day for 30 days I was
writing a blog because I think there's

1125
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:40,450
something about writing everyday.

1126
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,040
It really keeps your mind real sharp,

1127
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,350
you know,

1128
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,450
it's great for performing.

1129
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,920
It seems weird,

1130
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:45,910
but writing all the time,

1131
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:46,744
it's great for performance.

1132
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,650
So I was drinking a lot of coffee man and
then I tried to not have coffee once I

1133
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:52,840
was done and Iud did I get a headache?

1134
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,110
I got a 100 percent and I felt like shit.

1135
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:58,810
I felt like really like
sluggish and I was like,

1136
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,560
oh great.

1137
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,610
I'm addicted to caffeine.

1138
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,090
So I've done it a couple of times where
I've gotten off of caffeine and every

1139
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:07,330
time I've done it I have this weird
like for like a couple of days I have a

1140
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:07,571
rule.

1141
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:11,650
I don't drink caffeine after a certain
time unless I have to perform and I'm

1142
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:12,700
really sluggish,

1143
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:17,980
but like after 8:00 I try to cut it off
because then I can't sleep at night and

1144
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:21,160
I'm twitching and I'm waking up in the
middle of it and like to get a good

1145
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:22,000
night's sleep.

1146
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:22,950
I like I,

1147
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,160
I stopped drinking coffee.

1148
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,270
I'm addicted to.

1149
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:27,760
I have a bunch of different things
that I do to get ready for shows,

1150
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:31,270
but the number one best one
for sure is warm your body up.

1151
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,860
I do a lot of stretching,

1152
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,860
stretching is big
because when you stretch,

1153
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,420
like you really fucking stretch,

1154
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,580
you release tension and it just,

1155
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:39,811
you like,

1156
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:40,720
you feel better,

1157
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:41,510
you feel easier,

1158
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,360
like tension builds up in you.

1159
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,620
So before a show,

1160
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,290
like I warm up and I stretch
and I learned this new.

1161
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,890
I've learned this new breathing
stuff from Steve Maxwell.

1162
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,993
He's into this,

1163
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,641
he's this,

1164
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:52,890
uh,

1165
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:57,460
I'm a fitness trainer world would down
really high level fitness trainer.

1166
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,470
It's got degrees and he's also a
black belt in Jujitsu and he's a,

1167
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,060
you know,

1168
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,870
a world famous Kettlebell
instructor and really cool guy.

1169
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:06,330
But he's basically a,

1170
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,880
a guy who's lived his whole
life with a passion for fitness,

1171
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,301
you know,

1172
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:13,300
so he's always constantly
gathering information and
one of the things he's been

1173
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:13,991
concentrating on,

1174
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:15,280
his breathing techniques,

1175
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,480
he's been concentrated on a Pranayama
and all this yoga breathing.

1176
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,000
And so we did a bunch of these crazy,

1177
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:21,190
uh,

1178
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,450
breathing exercises like,

1179
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,313
God damn.

1180
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,180
I thought breathing was just bullshit.

1181
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:26,750
I thought it was like
breathe through your mouth.

1182
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,643
Breathe.

1183
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,800
I thought it was just something
where you're not being tough enough.

1184
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:30,251
Suck it up,

1185
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:31,230
Pussy Stop,

1186
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,510
stop boiling and about how your breathing.

1187
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:32,861
Let's go.

1188
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:33,830
Let's go do another lap.

1189
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:34,081
You know,

1190
00:32:34,081 --> 00:32:35,620
like that's what I always
stopped breathing was.

1191
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,080
But what it is is a,

1192
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:39,370
a much more rapid way of recovery.

1193
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
This pranayama

1194
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,760
breathing and that you can
actually control your breath
when you become like a,

1195
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,520
like a yoga guy,

1196
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:47,211
like a Yogi,

1197
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:48,530
like one of those high level guys,

1198
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,480
they actually can control their breath,

1199
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:51,171
like in control,

1200
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:52,620
their heart rate and it,

1201
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,820
like they can calm themselves down
when they're in periods of stress.

1202
00:32:55,821 --> 00:32:57,320
And so I started doing these,

1203
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:57,680
uh,

1204
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,041
these,

1205
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:58,370
uh,

1206
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,190
breathing exercises and
it's a fascinating shit.

1207
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:02,480
So that along with stretching,

1208
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,480
that's the best shot when I get older,

1209
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:05,751
man,

1210
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:06,710
and I'm not working out,

1211
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:06,981
man,

1212
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:10,730
my breathing goes to shit like when
I'm trying to run and stuff like that.

1213
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,410
It's like when you get older man,

1214
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,400
and you don't work out,

1215
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:17,210
you're rigor mortis starts setting
in and that's what you're fighting.

1216
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:18,080
Even though you're still alive,

1217
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,370
you're fighting rigor mortis,

1218
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:23,240
setting in and breathing
is a big part of that man.

1219
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:23,391
Well,

1220
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:25,400
this maxwell guy is 59 years old.

1221
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,170
He's in incredible shape,

1222
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:27,470
dude.

1223
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,910
I mean he does shit that I can't do it.

1224
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,450
He shows me some things and I can't
fucking do them and he's 59 years old.

1225
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:36,260
She's super healthy and just every day,

1226
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:38,330
super shredded and make
sure you train every day,

1227
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,980
trains everyday and when you do that,

1228
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:40,191
man,

1229
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:41,410
he force your body to work everyday.

1230
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:45,280
Your body just keeps flowing that blood
through their keeps building it up keeps

1231
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,480
and then you have this bag,

1232
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,860
better reserve of energy.

1233
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:48,694
It feel better.

1234
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,970
When I see dudes slowly let it slip
away and the gut grows and yeah man,

1235
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:53,430
I see.

1236
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,080
I just wanted it.

1237
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,820
That's why I brought you on this
podcast is a fat intervention.

1238
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,631
As soon as we leave here,

1239
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:00,620
we're going to go straight to the gym.

1240
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,580
We're going to do rounds in the bag.

1241
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,660
Don't know about that,

1242
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,811
but yeah,

1243
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:04,160
that's going.

1244
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,993
Even going back to your,

1245
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,050
your writing thing,

1246
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:06,270
it's,

1247
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:06,620
it's.

1248
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,140
I tell young comedians
like always be writing.

1249
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,430
It's a muscle,

1250
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,031
you know,

1251
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:12,120
so and also makes you.

1252
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:13,910
It reinforces the fact
that you're a professional,

1253
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,680
that you have worked to do,

1254
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,070
you know,

1255
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,490
there's a lot of comics who like to feel
like they're just fuck off's and you

1256
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:19,630
know,

1257
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,300
they just like to just go on stage and
try to remember what their jokes are and

1258
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:24,440
don't write anything down.

1259
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,750
You can do that.

1260
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,170
You chuckled.

1261
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:26,691
Junkies,

1262
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:29,570
they're very nervous about
not getting the laugh.

1263
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,160
They're afraid of that.

1264
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:32,750
They're afraid of that silence.

1265
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,591
Terrifying.

1266
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:37,820
Sometimes I just don't mind the silence
and then sometimes what I like to do

1267
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:38,091
now,

1268
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:40,190
if I run into a really shitty crowd,

1269
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:45,430
I like to go on my ipod and I get pocket
Sitcom and I add my own laughter to the

1270
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:50,000
crowd because sometimes I don't like the
crowd and I'd rather have my own life's

1271
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:52,790
going so I'll do this and to the
crowd or something like that.

1272
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,140
I'll do.

1273
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,540
I'll just go and just
enjoy my own laughter.

1274
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,493
You did,

1275
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:58,940
you know,

1276
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,330
this is an Internet meme and then have
you ever seen those where it says you're

1277
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:03,164
doing it wrong?

1278
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,023
Yeah.

1279
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,080
So that's what I do now.

1280
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,740
Well that's ridiculous,

1281
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:08,060
Sam.

1282
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,271
Well,

1283
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:11,540
I sometimes the crowds just staring at
me and I just don't feel that I did.

1284
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,520
The way the deal is you
to get your own crowds.

1285
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,140
That's when the world changes.

1286
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,320
It's real hard to like when you show
up at the store on a Tuesday night.

1287
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:19,610
That's why everybody likes doing that.

1288
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,360
Like people with the real reason why
people like to stop in and places is

1289
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:27,080
because until you become like really
super famous where every crowd is your

1290
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:27,650
crowd,

1291
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,850
Chris rock or something like that.

1292
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,571
You know,

1293
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:31,010
when you just stop in,

1294
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,470
then you get sort of a
slice of people that,

1295
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:33,880
you know,

1296
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,070
they're,

1297
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:34,700
they're not,

1298
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,800
they're not as inclined to laugh at you.

1299
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,310
They're not like super

1300
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,660
psyched to have seen you.

1301
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,710
Like all my God,

1302
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:42,030
we're going to go see Damon Wayans.

1303
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:42,864
We're so pumped up.

1304
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,810
Big Difference between that and
then sitting in the audience.

1305
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:44,971
Oh,

1306
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:45,870
Damon Wayans is here.

1307
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:46,560
You know,

1308
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,780
so he's going to get a much
more honest response from,

1309
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:49,351
you know,

1310
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:52,590
I've seen that before to see
comics who get out of there like,

1311
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,160
you know,

1312
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,640
uh,

1313
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,450
I'm not gonna say names,

1314
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,010
but you see him there in the crowd.

1315
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:56,521
They're crushing.

1316
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,311
Take them out of their crowd.

1317
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:58,710
It's just like,

1318
00:35:58,711 --> 00:35:59,790
well I'm back in the gym.

1319
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:00,660
I got to work out,

1320
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:01,681
you know,

1321
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:02,461
so it's like,

1322
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:02,941
yeah man.

1323
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:05,220
I mean once you have a big crowd,

1324
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:06,150
once you have your crowd,

1325
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:09,150
it's easier to work on new
finds a crowd sometimes.

1326
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:10,390
I don't know man,

1327
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:11,760
I just enjoy just going up there.

1328
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:13,110
I only do that when I'm doing like.

1329
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:13,590
What'd you say?

1330
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:18,100
Not everybody finds a buddy will
sometimes you have a crowd there.

1331
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,520
I think they're all at yourself short.

1332
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,980
Well they are definitely all fucked up.

1333
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,400
I hate to say these are the same.

1334
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,450
Those are St Louis people too,

1335
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,000
man.

1336
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,550
I ain't mostly crazy.

1337
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,250
My cloud fucked up but like to drink.

1338
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:33,084
Cool as fuck.

1339
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,290
So the mind man,

1340
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,850
my crowd is always fucked up.

1341
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,590
I have more pot smokers.

1342
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:38,424
I need to do that probably,

1343
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,420
you know,

1344
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,320
big pot smoker guy,

1345
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:40,711
but you do.

1346
00:36:40,711 --> 00:36:42,470
Sometimes you go in these waves.

1347
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,560
Depends on where I'm at right now.

1348
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:46,710
That's doing Sam Tripoli's on
and I'm sober wave and you know,

1349
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:47,521
it works better,

1350
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:49,830
but my problem is when
everything works better.

1351
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,320
A dude listen.

1352
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,640
I like the party dude.

1353
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:54,570
I like to get out there.

1354
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:55,404
I like to go,

1355
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,040
go nuts.

1356
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,370
Yeah.

1357
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,600
I'm a Nazi Guy Dude,

1358
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,160
because I just,

1359
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,150
I want it all.

1360
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,290
I want to do everything.

1361
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:01,831
I just,

1362
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:02,930
that's how I am man.

1363
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:03,980
And you know,

1364
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,401
you're funny.

1365
00:37:04,401 --> 00:37:06,960
It's while you're crazy impulsive.

1366
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,590
Yeah,

1367
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,423
I'm not.

1368
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,220
I want everything to be the
greatest story of our life.

1369
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,320
Every time I go out at
night drink I'm like,

1370
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,750
I want this to be legendary moment.

1371
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,710
And people are like,

1372
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,431
oh my God.

1373
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:18,930
Last night we were with AAA.

1374
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,070
Shit got crazy.

1375
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:20,550
And you know what?

1376
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,550
That catches up with
you after awhile and I,

1377
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:26,250
I know just sipping a beer or just like,

1378
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,350
that means that does nothing for me.

1379
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,340
Are you working this Friday?

1380
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,361
Uh,

1381
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:30,601
yeah.

1382
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:31,434
I'm in La Jolla.

1383
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,760
Why?

1384
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,740
Because I'm doing the comedy
Magic Club in Hermosa Beach.

1385
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,880
You're killing me dude.

1386
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:36,714
I love the.

1387
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,940
I love that place and fun.

1388
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,020
He's so nice.

1389
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:40,590
Man.

1390
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,330
Looks to be about twice a year and
a and I'm not right for his crap.

1391
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,121
I mean like I am,

1392
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:48,540
but even my nice stuff
has a little edge to it,

1393
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:49,410
you know what I'm saying?

1394
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,060
But he's so nice to put me up,

1395
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:51,481
you know?

1396
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:51,831
And uh,

1397
00:37:51,831 --> 00:37:53,060
I love playing that crap.

1398
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:56,250
I love editing myself as I go
because the nicest guy ever.

1399
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,220
It's just a nice fun club
and it's a great club.

1400
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,450
But he allows me,

1401
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,490
you know,

1402
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:01,680
well,

1403
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,650
because you bring a certain crowd
that packs bringing them in,

1404
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:05,940
but he won't let joey.

1405
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,431
Oh really?

1406
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:08,940
I've had joey a couple of times.

1407
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:09,960
It's too extreme.

1408
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,960
Crazy.

1409
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,580
We started talking about
stuff and things up.

1410
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:16,020
You're muffling yet he lifts are,

1411
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:16,950
which makes no sense.

1412
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,521
Well,

1413
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:17,940
Ari,

1414
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,000
apparently his sister.

1415
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,480
A little different dirt.

1416
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,230
Well first of all,

1417
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,080
he's Jewish so he gets a little pastor.

1418
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,213
That's right,

1419
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,030
Annie.

1420
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,260
And he looks,

1421
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,300
he doesn't,

1422
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,240
he's not threatening.

1423
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,830
You're going,

1424
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,610
oh my God,

1425
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,040
he's going to bang my
daughter tonight at your

1426
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,610
daughter tonight.

1427
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,091
He doesn't know.

1428
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:38,290
You look like he's from here.

1429
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:42,310
He goes back to the library and he
starts working on a dewey decimal system.

1430
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:42,971
Do you know what I'm saying?

1431
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:44,890
It's like I don't look at it that way.

1432
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:49,891
I look at dirty guys as having just as
much of a density for anger and violence

1433
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,030
as a as scary looking
people because Nerdy,

1434
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,730
a lot of times when you
kitchen nerdy person,

1435
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,730
you're catching them when
they're fucking about to break.

1436
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,870
You know their whole life.

1437
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,670
Someone's been fucking
with them their whole life.

1438
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,820
Girls have been shitting on them and
fucking they're ex boyfriends behind their

1439
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:04,390
backs.

1440
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,210
People have been stealing their
lunch by stuffing them into lockers,

1441
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,450
so when the shit goes wrong with
the nerdy guy could get crazy quick.

1442
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,530
Nothing falling down,

1443
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:14,950
Bro.

1444
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,731
Exactly,

1445
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:16,480
exactly.

1446
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,291
Falling down.

1447
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:20,450
I know a lot of nerdy dudes
that are suicidal too and know.

1448
00:39:20,451 --> 00:39:20,891
I know.

1449
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,720
I know some nerdy dudes that you know,

1450
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,700
especially when they
get into their thirties,

1451
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:25,270
you know,

1452
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,340
and their body starts to
slow down when they're,

1453
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,960
they're still unhappy with life.

1454
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,080
It gets tricky man.

1455
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:31,660
And when you're running a suicidal person,

1456
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,171
you know,

1457
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:33,490
if they're willing to kill themselves,

1458
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,460
the fuck are they willing to
do to you 100 percent man.

1459
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,890
Watch your p's and q's around crazy sun,

1460
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,200
super hot chicks who are suicidal.

1461
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:43,720
I mean because it's their reality.

1462
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,950
You're looking at them going,

1463
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:45,491
you're hot,

1464
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:45,790
you have.

1465
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,320
Everybody was bending over
backwards just to sniff your,

1466
00:39:49,321 --> 00:39:53,260
your magic and at the but
in their head they're like,

1467
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,490
they're miserable.

1468
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:55,324
It's not enough.

1469
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,310
You need a lot of things
to be happy in this life,

1470
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:57,550
man.

1471
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:57,971
You need,

1472
00:39:57,971 --> 00:39:58,990
you need fulfillment.

1473
00:39:58,991 --> 00:39:59,860
You need love,

1474
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:00,694
you need friendship.

1475
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,540
You need honesty.

1476
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,100
You need honesty about yourself.

1477
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,940
You need to be able to assess
your strengths and your
weaknesses and find your

1478
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,500
goals and achieve them.

1479
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:10,810
And you need a lot of
fucking things to be happy.

1480
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:11,180
You need,

1481
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:11,730
you need,

1482
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,420
you know,

1483
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,140
when I say find your
goals and achieve them,

1484
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:14,620
I mean like,

1485
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,070
you know,

1486
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,260
not necessarily like your
ultimate goal to be happy,

1487
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:18,094
but you have to do.

1488
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:23,430
People require improvement in their life
to be happy and it might be improvement

1489
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:24,160
of just you.

1490
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,210
I'm going to paint,

1491
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,370
I'm going to paint a landscape scene,

1492
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,331
get it done,

1493
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:29,164
and you look at it,

1494
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,513
I fucking did it.

1495
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,060
You know,

1496
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,390
when I,

1497
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,710
whenever I do anything,

1498
00:40:32,711 --> 00:40:34,810
whether it's a podcast
or I write something,

1499
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,840
that feeling that you get when
you're done like I did it.

1500
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,920
You need that to be happy.

1501
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:43,090
You got to just be a lazy fucking sit
around doing nothing while know a hundred

1502
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,700
percent and I'm to just going to
drink and fucking suit outside.

1503
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,780
You were going to get bored,

1504
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:47,021
man.

1505
00:40:47,021 --> 00:40:48,100
You're gonna want to do something?

1506
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:52,270
The idea of the ultimate idea of
ultimate vacation is a stupid idea.

1507
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:52,811
Uh,

1508
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:53,081
you know,

1509
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:54,130
even when I go on vacation,

1510
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:56,500
I'm good for like a day and
then I want to do something.

1511
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,340
I want to do some shit.

1512
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,420
So then it's vacation.

1513
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,440
What's go do fun shit.

1514
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:00,400
While we're on vacation,

1515
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,630
but the idea of just sitting and just
drinking in front of a fucking ocean for

1516
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:06,400
three days like Jesus Christ,

1517
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,540
how long can you do that?

1518
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,190
What kind of attention span do you have?

1519
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,720
But do you have a day of rest?

1520
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,650
One day?

1521
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,100
Yeah.

1522
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,890
That's my son.

1523
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,840
Sit down one day,

1524
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,501
Sunday.

1525
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:15,334
I just don't.

1526
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,780
I try not to do shit,

1527
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,610
but I sometimes I don't
feel like I deserve it,

1528
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,870
but I don't feel like I deserve it.

1529
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:21,760
I won't give them feel guilty sometimes,

1530
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,780
but I feel like you have to
have that moment of just relax.

1531
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:26,440
You Do,

1532
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,890
you do.

1533
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,870
But I think you have
to earn it in my mind.

1534
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,100
For me to be happy,

1535
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,420
I have to earn it.

1536
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,610
I have to make sure that I've not like
slacking off about a bunch of shit that

1537
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:38,390
piles up in your subconscious because
that's the shit that fucks with you when

1538
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:40,810
you're on brownies and that's
the shit that fucks with you.

1539
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:42,140
And when you're in the isolation tank,

1540
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,400
when I'm in the isolation tank,

1541
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,620
everything that fucks with me
as things that I'm not doing,

1542
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,270
it's 100 percent things that I'm not
doing or some mean stuff I said to someone

1543
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:51,200
when I was 10 or something.

1544
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,830
Like sometimes that'll come back and
you'll get some weird memory of that.

1545
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:56,490
But for me like you know,

1546
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,900
where I am in my life and what
I've done and all that stuff,

1547
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,980
I have one thing someone said to me
is I asked them how they were doing.

1548
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:06,400
They go a lot better
than I think I am know.

1549
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,260
Because sometimes people
like Neal Brennan,

1550
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,640
you're doing,

1551
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,610
you're actually probably doing better
than you give yourself credit for.

1552
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:14,421
But you know,

1553
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:18,100
sometimes people focus on what
hasn't happened yet or you know,

1554
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:20,990
then what has gone well in their life.

1555
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:25,820
And a lot of people sometimes compare
their insides to other people's outsides.

1556
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:29,150
And that's where you start
getting really weirded out.

1557
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:33,470
Like when you start looking at this guy
and he's got what you've always wanted

1558
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:35,120
or you think you've always
wanted and you're like,

1559
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,380
oh I don't get anything.

1560
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,380
And you don't realize how much
you've done with your life.

1561
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:44,710
I'm really just in the moment of there's
tons of stuff I would love to do and

1562
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:46,520
I'm working on doing.

1563
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,990
But like at the end of the day,

1564
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,800
like from what I've wanted to,

1565
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,810
I've done a lot of it.

1566
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,220
There's a lot more to do,

1567
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:53,320
but I've done a lot of it.

1568
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,390
The most important thing to
me when you have that feeling,

1569
00:42:56,391 --> 00:42:58,160
you compare yourself to other people.

1570
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,230
This is not a bad thing to do,

1571
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:05,290
but what you gotta do is only be
inspired and have that as an ethic.

1572
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,700
Don't ever be jealous.

1573
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:11,880
Don't ever be Uber self critical
or down yourself instead of.

1574
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:12,860
Yeah.

1575
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,693
Instead of going,

1576
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,410
I'm fucking lazy piece of Shit,

1577
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:15,561
you know,

1578
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:19,210
look at this guy's doing his fucking
second comedy central special and I don't

1579
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,500
even have a fucking hour and
a half that I really like,

1580
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:21,911
you know,

1581
00:43:21,911 --> 00:43:24,260
this is my socks and I
can't keep a relationship.

1582
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,270
Instead of saying that
instead of saying that,

1583
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,710
watch some guy that you really
love or respect or in instead of,

1584
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:31,580
you know,

1585
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,760
instead of being put down by it,

1586
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:37,210
be elevated because $100 got it.

1587
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,510
You can choose to do that,

1588
00:43:38,511 --> 00:43:39,050
man.

1589
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,250
People could choose to do that.

1590
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:40,590
Yeah,

1591
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,091
you might.

1592
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:41,901
You might be right.

1593
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:43,610
You might be a lazy piece of Shit.

1594
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,450
You might be right,

1595
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,470
but don't think about it.

1596
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,560
Don't concentrate on that because if you
concentrate on the fact that you're a

1597
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:49,520
lazy piece of Shit,

1598
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,800
you will continue to
manifest that reality.

1599
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,690
It sounds like hippie bullshit.

1600
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:54,813
Fucking true.

1601
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,270
Energy and intent.

1602
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:57,500
I have some thoughts,

1603
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:01,880
man about about reality and I have some
thoughts about the use of the mind and

1604
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:03,890
the imagination of how it sculps reality.

1605
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,130
I don't think it's as simple as they
want to break it down and like the secret

1606
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:10,490
and the law of attraction and I put
a picture of this house on the wall.

1607
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:10,611
Yeah.

1608
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:13,100
That's where years later I
was moving into that house.

1609
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,570
I don't think it's that,

1610
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,910
but I think it's kind of that.

1611
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,180
I think there's something to the idea
that your thoughts and imagination have an

1612
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:23,180
effect,

1613
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,013
a reality.

1614
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,750
This isn't my reason why
I say this because I think
the imagination is something

1615
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:34,560
that we're not taking it as
seriously as we should be,

1616
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,660
and what I mean by that
is that I don't think.

1617
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,220
If you looked at like what?

1618
00:44:38,221 --> 00:44:40,710
What part does this play in life?

1619
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,210
What part does food play in life?

1620
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:43,720
What part does the.

1621
00:44:43,721 --> 00:44:48,721
The imagination has a huge impact on our
reality because we take things out of

1622
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:54,150
the imagination and we build
them like this fucking laptop.

1623
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:59,540
It's came from originally from someone's
idea and it blossomed and evolved into

1624
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:00,660
what you see in front of you,

1625
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:02,370
but it came out of the imagination.

1626
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,720
It came out of the air.

1627
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,930
Someone figured out how to put something
together because they had an idea.

1628
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,831
They had a spark.

1629
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:08,790
They saw the vision,

1630
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:13,320
they saw it feel fully formed in their
mind or they saw steps along the way

1631
00:45:13,321 --> 00:45:15,390
fully formed and they
figured out how to do that.

1632
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:20,220
I think your mind doesn't just control
things in a sense that you bring things

1633
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:21,054
out of the ether,

1634
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,690
you bring things out of your imagination
and bring them and manifest them in the

1635
00:45:24,691 --> 00:45:25,524
real world,

1636
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:30,560
but I think your mind actually has an
effect on how things go in the real world.

1637
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,463
As I said before,

1638
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,061
don't.

1639
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:35,100
I don't understand quantum physics,

1640
00:45:35,101 --> 00:45:35,940
I don't get it,

1641
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,680
but I do know that they've done tests
where they show that particles react

1642
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:45,060
differently if you're observing them
than if you're not observing them and I

1643
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,890
think there's probably something,

1644
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:51,870
some unmeasurable thing that's too
fucking freaky and far out and really

1645
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:52,800
difficult to prove,

1646
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,870
but I don't think it's outside the realm
of possibility that there's your mind

1647
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,850
might have some sort of
an impact on reality.

1648
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,631
You know,

1649
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:03,650
babies are still going to get killed by
drive bys and people are still going to

1650
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,920
get caught in avalanches just randomly.

1651
00:46:05,921 --> 00:46:06,111
To me,

1652
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:06,630
it's not.

1653
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,460
Not to say that shit can't happen.

1654
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,940
Shouldn't most certainly can happen
and most certainly there are natural

1655
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:15,030
occurrences that are going to be
absolutely beyond anyone's control.

1656
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:15,361
You know,

1657
00:46:15,361 --> 00:46:17,280
there's levels of
experiences like you know,

1658
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:18,720
you get to a meteor impact,

1659
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:19,554
that's a wrap.

1660
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,600
Maybe 65 million years ago,

1661
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:24,930
a big one slammed in and there's nothing
bigger than a fucking hamster lived.

1662
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:25,640
That's it.

1663
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,340
Boom.

1664
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,190
And that could happen again and no,

1665
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,200
no matter how much imagination
you have and how much you,

1666
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:30,540
you,

1667
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:30,751
you,

1668
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:31,021
you,

1669
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,940
you dream of a perfect world.

1670
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,440
I don't know if you can prevent that.

1671
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:36,900
I think that there
might be quantum things,

1672
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:39,900
there might be macro things that might
be a whole bunch of things working

1673
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:40,470
together,

1674
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:45,470
but I don't discount the idea that you
can use your own mind and you're in your

1675
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:48,900
own imagination to manipulate
reality to a certain degree.

1676
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:49,411
Now,

1677
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:50,101
100 percent,

1678
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:54,440
I've always felt felt the energy you
give out sometimes most of the time here,

1679
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:54,650
Angie,

1680
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,200
you get back.

1681
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,510
How about dudes who just
force shit with their mind?

1682
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,000
You know,

1683
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,980
this is going to sound crazy,

1684
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:01,350
but when Dane Cook became really famous,

1685
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,080
that was one of the first things
that I thought of and I was like,

1686
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:04,351
wow,

1687
00:47:04,351 --> 00:47:08,940
this guy wanted it so much that he figured
out a way to make it like Dane Cook,

1688
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,790
we all have talked about
it in the comedy world.

1689
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,220
That was a real shocker
for a lot of us were like,

1690
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:14,611
wow,

1691
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:15,480
how did he do that?

1692
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:16,410
That's amazing.

1693
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,610
How do you get that big,

1694
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,710
that big,

1695
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,381
that big.

1696
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:19,740
Yeah,

1697
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,573
but the whole thing,

1698
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:22,440
you can always point.

1699
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:25,080
You could always tell someone's
going to work and I always felt,

1700
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,040
you know,

1701
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,370
he's,

1702
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,960
he's a different person right now.

1703
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:29,590
I feel that that when I him,

1704
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,290
which was many years ago,

1705
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,330
was way different now because it's
successful and he sort of relaxed and he's

1706
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:38,350
realized that things in his life have
happened that made him reassess where he

1707
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:40,910
wants to be and what he has brought us.

1708
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,710
We want them all.

1709
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:41,841
Yeah,

1710
00:47:41,841 --> 00:47:42,021
yeah,

1711
00:47:42,021 --> 00:47:42,854
yeah,

1712
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:44,170
yeah.

1713
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,030
But he was a win at all cost guy.

1714
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:46,331
Yes,

1715
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:46,990
exactly.

1716
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,710
And with that comes a
certain price and you know,

1717
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:52,420
I've always said that and
not that he's a bad person,

1718
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:55,480
but I've always said sometimes
bad things happen to good people,

1719
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,010
but I always felt bad things always
happen to bad people and it may not be

1720
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:02,830
instantaneous and it may
not have the board bad.

1721
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,200
Maybe isn't the right
way to describe somebody.

1722
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:08,290
But I feel like if you're always
putting out energy and you're,

1723
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:08,900
you're,

1724
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,020
you're fucking over your fellow man to,

1725
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,570
to win almost.

1726
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,510
It's going to come back.

1727
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:14,980
And it might not be instantaneous.

1728
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,160
Meaning if I fuck you right now that you
know I'm going to walk out and get hit

1729
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:18,820
by a car,

1730
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,580
you never know.

1731
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:19,731
Well,

1732
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:20,540
this is what I think.

1733
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,630
I think that the only time that
doesn't work as associate paths,

1734
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:27,920
because sociopaths don't seem to have
any feelings about things like that.

1735
00:48:27,921 --> 00:48:29,510
They don't worry about
hurting people's feelings.

1736
00:48:29,511 --> 00:48:29,710
They don't,

1737
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:30,830
they don't feel connected.

1738
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,440
But the real problem with
regular people like you and I,

1739
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,260
is that you feel connected with
someone when you hurt their feelings.

1740
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,070
Like I've had people that are hecklers
there that are just idiots and they're

1741
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:41,270
ruining a show.

1742
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,210
There's a thousand people in
there and one person wants to,

1743
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,250
wants to fucking throw in their own
stupid brain and and slosh up the whole

1744
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:49,491
show.

1745
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:50,990
So I'll destroy this person,

1746
00:48:50,991 --> 00:48:51,591
I'll torture them.

1747
00:48:51,591 --> 00:48:52,490
I break down their life,

1748
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:53,390
but I feel bad.

1749
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,320
I don't feel good about it.

1750
00:48:54,321 --> 00:48:55,340
I don't want to do that.

1751
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:56,840
I want everybody to have a good time.

1752
00:48:56,841 --> 00:48:57,950
I don't want to hurt this guy's feelings.

1753
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,120
And as the guys leaving,

1754
00:48:59,121 --> 00:48:59,721
fuck you,

1755
00:48:59,721 --> 00:49:00,800
you're fucking zero.

1756
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:01,461
And I'm like,

1757
00:49:01,461 --> 00:49:01,831
come on man,

1758
00:49:01,831 --> 00:49:02,900
I'm at least on one or a two.

1759
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:03,763
This is ridiculous.

1760
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,210
And everyone's laughing and I'm like,

1761
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,920
what the fuck are you 100 percent.

1762
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:08,990
He crazy asshole.

1763
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,320
100,000 people here and you're trying
to ruin their night and people are

1764
00:49:12,321 --> 00:49:13,011
screaming and cheering.

1765
00:49:13,011 --> 00:49:13,844
This guy's leaving.

1766
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:14,720
And as the guys leaving,

1767
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,733
I feel bad.

1768
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,870
I do like,

1769
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,530
does he want his night's ruined?

1770
00:49:18,531 --> 00:49:18,921
Yes.

1771
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:19,541
I don't want to hurt him,

1772
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:20,450
but you really just want to

1773
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,800
perform and entertain people
that paid money to see exactly.

1774
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,970
I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.

1775
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,420
I think people that that
hurt people's feelings,

1776
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,520
even if you justify it,

1777
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,940
you know you did something and I think
the thing that fucks with your head and

1778
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:36,490
it devalues you in your own eyes.

1779
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,990
You're not a hero in your own eyes.

1780
00:49:37,991 --> 00:49:38,381
You're not,

1781
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:39,700
you're not someone who you respect,

1782
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:41,950
you know you're doing what
you gotta do to get by,

1783
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:44,380
but ultimately you're
not respecting yourself.

1784
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,130
And I think we all have a certain amount
of appreciation and respect for hero

1785
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:48,581
figures.

1786
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:48,831
You know,

1787
00:49:48,831 --> 00:49:52,330
like we all look at like the guy who
never lies and it always does the right

1788
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:54,430
thing and fucking helps everybody out.

1789
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,050
And that's the John Wayne character.

1790
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:56,261
You know,

1791
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:56,521
that's,

1792
00:49:56,521 --> 00:49:57,020
that's the,

1793
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:57,940
the ultimate hero.

1794
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:01,300
And when you look at your own
life and you don't stack up,

1795
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:02,051
you're a thief.

1796
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:06,400
You stole money from your wife's purse
and you know you don't want to smoke

1797
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:06,821
cigarettes,

1798
00:50:06,821 --> 00:50:08,200
but you fucking have to.

1799
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,460
You can't deal with the stress.

1800
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:10,210
You smoke,

1801
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,380
you devalue yourself.

1802
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,180
You slowly start devaluing yourself.

1803
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:13,680
You will.

1804
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,501
You look at yourself,

1805
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:16,660
you realize that if you
were judging yourself,

1806
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:18,100
you would judge yourself unfavorably.

1807
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,120
If you're stealing,

1808
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:20,170
if you're hurting people,

1809
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,241
so no matter who,

1810
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:24,980
you can't pretend you're the the,

1811
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:25,340
the,

1812
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,040
the hero of your story.

1813
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:27,891
You can't.

1814
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:31,430
You have to be the hero of your
own story and you can do that.

1815
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:34,340
You can be the hero of your
own story that woke up today.

1816
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:38,990
You can be the hero of your own story
that at 40 years of age stopped,

1817
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,850
got out of bed and said,

1818
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,680
I'm not doing this anymore.

1819
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,100
I'm doing this different Andrea.

1820
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:49,170
I am going to figure this out and I want
to do it only by my instincts and only

1821
00:50:49,581 --> 00:50:53,420
by my morals and my ideals and my mind
and I'm going to be dead honest with

1822
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:56,180
myself because I'm realizing this is not
going to last forever and I'm going to

1823
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:58,850
be the nicest fucking
human being to everyone.

1824
00:50:58,850 --> 00:50:59,990
I meet possibly,

1825
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,190
and I'm going to get myself in shape,

1826
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:03,230
but I'm going to eat healthy and I'm
going to do this because this is.

1827
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,071
This is me.

1828
00:51:04,071 --> 00:51:04,550
Now.

1829
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:09,550
I decided that this is me and people have
to realize that you are not your past.

1830
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,650
You are not all the times you fucked up,

1831
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:13,900
you are not all the times.

1832
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:14,810
You couldn't get it up,

1833
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:17,330
you're not all the times
you were drunk and you know,

1834
00:51:17,331 --> 00:51:19,310
and you threw up in someone's car,

1835
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,210
you that's not you,

1836
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:20,861
but you,

1837
00:51:20,861 --> 00:51:25,520
you are the person who's learned from
a great deal of experiences that if you

1838
00:51:25,521 --> 00:51:28,490
learn correctly and if you
process them correctly,

1839
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,230
you'll have a happier life.

1840
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:30,890
You know,

1841
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:31,671
in recovery.

1842
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,930
That's a big part of it.

1843
00:51:32,931 --> 00:51:33,370
When they,

1844
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,010
you know,

1845
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,280
you're supposed to list all the stuff
you've done and apologized to them and

1846
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:37,650
you.

1847
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:39,860
What it is is you just get
it out and you're like,

1848
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:40,694
I did this.

1849
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,570
I'm sorry.

1850
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:42,440
Now it's gone.

1851
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:43,280
You have done.

1852
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:45,020
And usually the person you admit to,

1853
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:45,621
they'll be like,

1854
00:51:45,621 --> 00:51:47,540
I did all that and a little more.

1855
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:48,740
Look where I am,

1856
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,120
it doesn't define you.

1857
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,021
And that's the truth.

1858
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:52,430
And sometimes people hold onto that.

1859
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:53,150
So you know,

1860
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,030
psychological stuff like
athletes and entertainers.

1861
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,140
Sometimes they'll do something
and something bad will
happen and it almost like

1862
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:00,771
wounds them.

1863
00:52:00,771 --> 00:52:01,604
It's like high school,

1864
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:02,241
so in shit,

1865
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:02,870
Anya,

1866
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,320
it sticks with us instead of understanding
that that was a moment in time and

1867
00:52:06,321 --> 00:52:08,720
that person was probably hurt themselves.

1868
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,700
It doesn't define you as a person.

1869
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:11,091
Yeah.

1870
00:52:11,091 --> 00:52:11,481
Yeah.

1871
00:52:11,481 --> 00:52:12,110
You,

1872
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:15,050
we all do things that were
not happy that we did.

1873
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,740
But that doesn't mean that's you now,

1874
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:17,600
you know,

1875
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:17,831
I mean,

1876
00:52:17,831 --> 00:52:18,380
do you know going to.

1877
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,360
You got to learn that and the,

1878
00:52:19,361 --> 00:52:23,540
the thing about apologizing to
someone once you get it out there,

1879
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,160
once you've relieved this tension,

1880
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,160
then it's no longer this burden that
you're carrying around because otherwise

1881
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:29,120
you have like burdens.

1882
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:30,260
Like I seriously,

1883
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:35,060
I was all think about some shit that
happened from fucking 20 or 30 years ago

1884
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,020
and I'll be like,

1885
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:36,601
oh,

1886
00:52:36,601 --> 00:52:37,700
I should have been nicer to her.

1887
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:38,300
Or Oh,

1888
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,590
I shouldn't have talked to
him that way and it will,

1889
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:41,480
it will fuck with me.

1890
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:43,310
Like 20 or 30 years later,

1891
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:44,900
there's this girl named Aaron mcnally.

1892
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:48,920
I went to school there and I went to my
last reunion just hoping that she would

1893
00:52:48,921 --> 00:52:53,510
show up because during elementary school
we treated her so badly and I hated it

1894
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:54,321
and it wasn't part of it,

1895
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:54,800
but I,

1896
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,850
I saw it happening,

1897
00:52:55,851 --> 00:52:57,950
but I wasn't strong enough
to cause I was a kid.

1898
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,260
I've always wanted to like,

1899
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:00,830
just be like,

1900
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,230
I'm sorry that that had happened,

1901
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:02,810
man.

1902
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:03,140
Yeah.

1903
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,190
Well when I was a kid,

1904
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:04,610
um,

1905
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:08,180
especially as I got older and
it was more and more angry,

1906
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,080
I became,

1907
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:09,470
uh,

1908
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,000
the first person to pull the trigger.

1909
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:14,090
I was like the first person to
insult someone because I figured,

1910
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:14,241
well,

1911
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:16,670
you're going to insult
me so I'll get you first.

1912
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,270
You know,

1913
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:17,841
and you know,

1914
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:18,071
you,

1915
00:53:18,071 --> 00:53:18,450
you,

1916
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:21,950
you develop this sort of a
protective personality like that.

1917
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:24,020
Especially if like you're a little
guy and people want to fuck with you.

1918
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:25,770
And that was me.

1919
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:26,370
And

1920
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,390
when you do that,

1921
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:27,630
you know,

1922
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:30,330
you all of a sudden that'll
be a way you behave now.

1923
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:31,830
And then you'll say things like,

1924
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:32,830
I don't even say that that's,

1925
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,470
that's such a Douchey
fucking thing to say,

1926
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,570
but it's just a purely.

1927
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,700
It's based purely on insecurity.

1928
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:39,210
We used to,

1929
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:43,420
I used to call it the triple a low
blow where we would be like having,

1930
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,101
what are you doing over there,

1931
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:44,341
buddy?

1932
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:45,660
You want to participate
in the conversation?

1933
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,460
And there's no way I could do that

1934
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:52,320
anticipating this conversation
because it was so long winded.

1935
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:54,330
I don't even know what you guys
were talking about near the end.

1936
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,870
I know we're talking about to break it
down for her and it's like a two year old

1937
00:53:57,871 --> 00:53:58,370
boy.

1938
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:58,580
No,

1939
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,310
I mean I got the,

1940
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:02,820
the main point near the beginning and
then it was kind of like I just stopped

1941
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:03,300
listening.

1942
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:03,630
You know,

1943
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:03,790
I,

1944
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:07,140
I have a real problem like in
school with anything when it,

1945
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:10,020
when something gets really deep
into a conversation and less,

1946
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:12,720
it's about something that
I'm totally interested in,

1947
00:54:12,721 --> 00:54:14,550
like to solve some kind of mystery.

1948
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,181
Uh,

1949
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:15,661
it's,

1950
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:15,911
I,

1951
00:54:15,911 --> 00:54:17,220
I just lose interest in it.

1952
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,230
How about we talk about
are you going to stink,

1953
00:54:19,231 --> 00:54:19,900
dude,

1954
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,731
you fucking shoes.

1955
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:23,890
But really think something's
wrong with my feet right now.

1956
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:25,800
It's wrong.

1957
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,790
Or is it your shoes?

1958
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:28,710
I think these shoes are fucked up.

1959
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:29,790
This is the grossest thing ever.

1960
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:32,310
When someone takes their shoes
off track right next to you.

1961
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,720
But did you smell it?

1962
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:34,920
I smell it.

1963
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,430
Just smelled it right when he said it.

1964
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,370
I'm going to light some incense.

1965
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:39,470
You Stinky motherfucker.

1966
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,690
I have really old gym shoes
on because I was moving on.

1967
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,960
Let's talk about whether Brian's going
to be okay with a tranny being on the

1968
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:47,630
podcast tomorrow.

1969
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,620
So who is this girl guy?

1970
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,950
It's a listen,

1971
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,010
here's my whole thing,

1972
00:54:53,011 --> 00:54:53,640
man.

1973
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,421
I'm already,

1974
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:55,051
you know this person.

1975
00:54:55,051 --> 00:54:55,291
By the way,

1976
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,190
did you meet this person?

1977
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,340
Meet this person at a bar or a friend.

1978
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,250
Now what a bitch.

1979
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:07,490
I just feel like in the naughty show is
I want to explore all stuff and I'm fine

1980
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:10,110
with anybody.

1981
00:55:10,111 --> 00:55:12,390
Do whatever they want with
the consenting adults.

1982
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,111
And so,

1983
00:55:13,111 --> 00:55:13,381
you know,

1984
00:55:13,381 --> 00:55:15,060
you can't do naughty show
and it just can't be like,

1985
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,050
let's Bang Pornstar.

1986
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:20,310
I want to explore everything and all the
different aspects of not just sexuality

1987
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:21,570
but just people.

1988
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,390
And their behavior and everything like
that and I just wanted to and I thought

1989
00:55:25,391 --> 00:55:28,080
it might be interesting to have
her on and see what that's like.

1990
00:55:28,081 --> 00:55:28,720
How do you get.

1991
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,553
I'm always interested.

1992
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:30,060
I mean,

1993
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,060
it's a funny subject.

1994
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,380
I'm glad you brought this up because I
wanted to talk about this very subject

1995
00:55:34,381 --> 00:55:36,540
because so many on the
message board printed.

1996
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:36,810
Uh,

1997
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:37,141
he goes,

1998
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:37,281
uh,

1999
00:55:37,281 --> 00:55:38,850
I organized my porn folder.

2000
00:55:38,851 --> 00:55:43,851
That was the thread and it look at it
and it's like 80 percent she mails and

2001
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:47,910
trannies and everybody
was like a trolling,

2002
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:48,360
like what,

2003
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,290
what are you doing with your trail?

2004
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:51,060
You joking around like what are you doing?

2005
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:52,260
And um,

2006
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:56,220
it was basically what he was doing was
getting the conversation started and then

2007
00:55:56,221 --> 00:55:57,380
as you go to the conversation starter,

2008
00:55:57,381 --> 00:55:57,541
it's like,

2009
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:57,721
no,

2010
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:58,590
I'm in a regular girls.

2011
00:55:58,591 --> 00:55:59,111
But uh,

2012
00:55:59,111 --> 00:55:59,281
I,

2013
00:55:59,281 --> 00:55:59,611
you know,

2014
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:00,810
I do watch a lot of tranny porn.

2015
00:56:00,811 --> 00:56:05,460
I've had some training x escorts
and like super honest about it.

2016
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:05,971
And everybody's like,

2017
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:06,541
whoa dude,

2018
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:07,374
you got balls.

2019
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:08,821
But not really.

2020
00:56:08,821 --> 00:56:09,001
I mean,

2021
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:09,530
yes,

2022
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:10,500
he definitely has balls,

2023
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,750
but it's a cool environment
that you're doing it in.

2024
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:15,990
Like that's the best way to use the
Internet if you've got some crazy fucking

2025
00:56:15,991 --> 00:56:18,720
freak thing and you can talk
about it and your name is,

2026
00:56:18,721 --> 00:56:19,554
you know,

2027
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,860
mock ficky 50,

2028
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:21,720
right?

2029
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,800
No one's going to know who you want.

2030
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:23,650
Let's.

2031
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:24,070
You can make

2032
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,590
up whatever the fuck you want
your name to be and then you know,

2033
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:28,690
it's just a character on a message board.

2034
00:56:28,691 --> 00:56:30,010
Who knows if he's even telling the truth.

2035
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,191
I mean,

2036
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:31,840
it might just be an ultimate troll.

2037
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,160
People love to do things like that and
then giggle and pretending I'm pretending

2038
00:56:36,161 --> 00:56:36,994
I'm Brazilian.

2039
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,260
People love doing things like that.

2040
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:39,881
I just found it,

2041
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:40,080
you know,

2042
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,670
it's like sort of two
biggest porn types out.

2043
00:56:42,671 --> 00:56:47,470
The genres are interracial and
tranny porn because I missed a bit.

2044
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,150
One of the biggest,

2045
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,360
the two biggest wow.

2046
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,740
You would know because folks,

2047
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,060
this is not coming out of a manager.

2048
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:53,710
That's the person that's
coming to the studio.

2049
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:54,603
That's a tranny.

2050
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,713
Whoa.

2051
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,833
That looks like a dude.

2052
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:57,701
Yeah.

2053
00:56:57,701 --> 00:56:58,534
Some of them,

2054
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:01,690
when they go to fuck when they
go too far with the makeup here,

2055
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:02,050
trannies,

2056
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,070
let me give you a little piece of advice.

2057
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:08,410
You're better off looking sort of like
a man with less makeup than look like a

2058
00:57:08,411 --> 00:57:11,050
tranny with a lot of makeup because
when you have a lot of makeup on,

2059
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:12,460
it always looks like you're trying to.

2060
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:13,960
What am I trying to trick me?

2061
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,820
They try to go look like lumberjacks.

2062
00:57:15,821 --> 00:57:18,670
What guys are really at all
around with the lesbian.

2063
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,160
Butch was the ones that
don't want to work.

2064
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:22,330
They look like hot chicks,

2065
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:22,840
right?

2066
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,321
Lipstick,

2067
00:57:23,321 --> 00:57:23,950
lesbians,

2068
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:24,820
and they're my fans.

2069
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,080
Well those are the ones
that don't want to work.

2070
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:26,800
I did.

2071
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,190
They are.

2072
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:30,130
They want a woman to come along and
take care of him the way a man would.

2073
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:33,790
They want a woman to be like
their bodyguard and they're
usually passing through

2074
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,260
just Chaz Bono them,

2075
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:36,100
you know,

2076
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,990
100 grand that look like
Larry the cable guy.

2077
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:39,730
That's so fucked up.

2078
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:40,780
Is that what it costs?

2079
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,613
100 grand.

2080
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:43,180
You know what's weird about Chaz Bono?

2081
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:43,420
Look,

2082
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:43,901
first of all,

2083
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:44,690
I don't.

2084
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,440
I would never criticize someone who's
doing that because I don't know what the

2085
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:47,621
fuck.

2086
00:57:47,621 --> 00:57:48,090
It's like.

2087
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:52,540
I don't know what the inside of his body.

2088
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:53,260
I don't know.

2089
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,970
I don't think I have no problems with it.

2090
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,781
Be Yourself,

2091
00:57:55,781 --> 00:57:56,351
but don't tell me.

2092
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:57,184
It's a little weird.

2093
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:57,760
Okay.

2094
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,001
Like,

2095
00:57:58,001 --> 00:57:58,211
you know,

2096
00:57:58,211 --> 00:58:00,220
it's like if your cat
starts barking like a dog,

2097
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:01,540
it's a little weird.

2098
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:05,110
I'm not saying it's wrong and I
totally support his right to do it,

2099
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,090
but it's not normal.

2100
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:07,720
Normal.

2101
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,040
I don't think she's saying it's not.

2102
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:09,641
I think.

2103
00:58:09,641 --> 00:58:09,881
No,

2104
00:58:09,881 --> 00:58:12,230
I think that's what exactly
do you call it here?

2105
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:12,540
She,

2106
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:12,990
I call me.

2107
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,490
He at now I call my he.

2108
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:15,970
Yeah.

2109
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:16,780
That's why he is now.

2110
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,580
Respectfully.

2111
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,040
Yeah.

2112
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,370
Yeah.

2113
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,500
I have to see his dick called me.

2114
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:20,150
Hey,

2115
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:21,070
that's my idea.

2116
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:22,091
Say Hey,

2117
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:22,930
what's up Chaz?

2118
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,370
I wouldn't say he or she may.

2119
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,380
We'll just call him a chest.

2120
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:29,410
The navajos thought that
there was four basics,

2121
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,530
a basic sexist,

2122
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,640
that it wasn't for preferences.

2123
00:58:33,641 --> 00:58:34,740
It wasn't male females,

2124
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,051
male,

2125
00:58:35,051 --> 00:58:35,531
female,

2126
00:58:35,531 --> 00:58:36,580
masculine woman,

2127
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:37,690
Feminine Male,

2128
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,100
and then they thought that makes sense.

2129
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:40,510
Just a natural thing.

2130
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:43,930
And then there was always people that
wish they were born a girl and it was.

2131
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:44,830
And I believe it,

2132
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,130
I,

2133
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:45,670
I,

2134
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:46,570
100 percent believable.

2135
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:47,890
There's just too many people.

2136
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:48,131
I mean,

2137
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:49,850
I know it could be just nutty people,

2138
00:58:49,851 --> 00:58:51,660
it could be some weird imbalance.

2139
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:55,600
It's one thing that has
proven that experiences will
literally shape the mapping

2140
00:58:55,601 --> 00:59:00,010
of your fucking mind and the way your
mind makes correlations and the way you

2141
00:59:00,011 --> 00:59:01,990
know and even shape your jeans.

2142
00:59:01,991 --> 00:59:06,040
You know that it's genes are activated
because of certain stresses and different

2143
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,450
things that happened to you
like literally in the womb.

2144
00:59:08,451 --> 00:59:09,220
Man.

2145
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:09,461
You know?

2146
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:13,520
That's why so many people that come from
really super volatile environments are

2147
00:59:13,521 --> 00:59:17,140
really quick to jump and be violent and
the reason being is that they're fucking

2148
00:59:17,141 --> 00:59:18,400
program to say,

2149
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:18,820
Hey,

2150
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,710
we're going to shoot you out in
the middle of a fucking war zone.

2151
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:22,340
Okay?

2152
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,173
When you come out,

2153
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:25,400
it's craziness right out the get go.

2154
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:28,700
Your mom almost got shot today coming
home from work and you experienced all

2155
00:59:28,701 --> 00:59:32,070
this inside the womb that your
body's like getting ready for war.

2156
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:36,260
It's triggering set as triggering
everything in variances and you draw from

2157
00:59:36,261 --> 00:59:38,580
those experiences on how to react to it.

2158
00:59:38,581 --> 00:59:40,130
Search in certain situations,

2159
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,650
but the back to the
training stuff is like,

2160
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,830
I believe it's like gay
training wheels that.

2161
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:46,340
No,

2162
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,350
it's not that.

2163
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:47,710
No,

2164
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:50,690
but why it's so popular on the Internet.

2165
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,141
Oh,

2166
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:51,711
I see what you're saying.

2167
00:59:51,711 --> 00:59:52,340
The porn.

2168
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:52,730
Yeah.

2169
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,080
Why is it so popular?

2170
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:56,390
Videos?

2171
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,130
I think there's a broad spectrum.

2172
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:58,871
That's what I think.

2173
00:59:58,871 --> 00:59:59,300
I think,

2174
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,080
you know,

2175
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,460
I think there's a broad spectrum of,

2176
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,150
of uh,

2177
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:06,200
sexual likes and dislikes and some guys
literally get off and they're not even

2178
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:06,710
gay.

2179
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:09,500
They get off on looking
at other guys' dicks.

2180
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:13,520
They'll get off on looking at a guy's
dick being hard to imagine it was there.

2181
01:00:13,521 --> 01:00:13,881
Dick.

2182
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:16,580
And they get little literally low
watch porn and get off on the dix.

2183
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:16,761
Well,

2184
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:18,710
I think that's why interracial porn.

2185
01:00:18,711 --> 01:00:19,880
So they just love watching.

2186
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:24,270
These are just big bazooka was
just destroying these little girl.

2187
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:24,951
I don't know.

2188
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:27,860
I don't understand that because I can't
relate because it's not like that's a

2189
01:00:27,861 --> 01:00:28,370
black dick.

2190
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:29,090
That's not my Dick.

2191
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:30,050
That's all I was looking at it.

2192
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:32,270
That's why like when I see a
dude's got a little tiny deck,

2193
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:32,720
I'm like,

2194
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,500
come on son.

2195
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,130
That ain't my deck,

2196
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,210
I can't pretend this is my deck.

2197
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,820
So this is like fun porn for me.

2198
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,100
This is my little Dick Porno guy.

2199
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:40,461
Plenty.

2200
01:00:40,461 --> 01:00:41,510
A little dig porno guys.

2201
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:42,230
Like how?

2202
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,700
What's little like?

2203
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:44,080
I don't,

2204
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,420
I've never big.

2205
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,071
I can't relate.

2206
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:46,890
Six,

2207
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:47,723
seven,

2208
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:56,300
sometimes fat guys to fat guys with
little digs and some dudes love that shit

2209
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,580
because I go there could be me,

2210
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,423
man.

2211
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,370
I was amazed that
there's not more of that.

2212
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:06,110
Like because that's what porn start
out really ugly guys begging super hot

2213
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:07,940
chicks because that was the fantasy.

2214
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,151
Well,

2215
01:01:08,151 --> 01:01:10,490
have you seen some of the new porn
that they're doing with the porno?

2216
01:01:10,491 --> 01:01:11,600
Stars will fuck a fan?

2217
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:12,500
Yeah.

2218
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,640
The fuck a real fan.

2219
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,580
And they'll let the fan come inside
of them and everything like damn.

2220
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:16,820
Oh,

2221
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:17,653
that's what my,

2222
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:18,831
that's what my,

2223
01:01:18,831 --> 01:01:19,220
uh,

2224
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:23,480
at my naughty show they wanted a director
wanted to come and raffle off to,

2225
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:23,990
uh,

2226
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,660
one of the co selling and the,

2227
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:27,350
I don't know that the
establishment was like,

2228
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:27,711
I don't know,

2229
01:01:27,711 --> 01:01:28,360
that's legal.

2230
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,710
Which establishment cheetahs?

2231
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:31,551
They said,

2232
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:32,384
no,

2233
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:33,141
Jesus Christ.

2234
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:34,010
How is it not illegal?

2235
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:34,990
He just arranging,

2236
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:36,970
there's no money being taken change.

2237
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,720
Something weird had happened.

2238
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:42,050
Like arranging pornography
if something weird.

2239
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,420
That's their whole theory
to get some fucking savage.

2240
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:44,961
Yeah,

2241
01:01:44,961 --> 01:01:47,480
you could raffle it off and you
could say that your buddy one.

2242
01:01:47,481 --> 01:01:48,021
Who's a fucking.

2243
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:48,450
I got bay,

2244
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:50,420
a Buchi straight Outta jail dude.

2245
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:50,880
Yeah,

2246
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,713
just kill it.

2247
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:54,230
Just kind of doing ultimate
kiss night or something.

2248
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,820
It would be fucking her
on the camera though,

2249
01:01:55,821 --> 01:01:56,180
Dude.

2250
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:58,600
I mean it would be like a
video that they make there.

2251
01:01:58,610 --> 01:01:59,450
That's their whole thing.

2252
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:00,231
Someone bad,

2253
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:01,041
they could be liable.

2254
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:01,341
I'm like,

2255
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:01,941
I don't know how,

2256
01:02:01,941 --> 01:02:02,480
but.

2257
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,320
So they didn't want to do it.

2258
01:02:03,321 --> 01:02:04,440
I thought it was going to be hilarious.

2259
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:05,330
Changed the wording though,

2260
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:06,440
like ultimate kids night.

2261
01:02:06,441 --> 01:02:07,460
Like make it something like that.

2262
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:09,590
Like it was implied that everyone knows.

2263
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:10,610
I mean it doesn't.

2264
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:11,660
Howard stern do that though.

2265
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,780
He sets it up where they go and fuck God.

2266
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:15,111
Fuck guys.

2267
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:17,680
I ran it by Cheetah and they
were cheetahs and they were like,

2268
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,150
you said it really well.

2269
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,980
You know what it is

2270
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,221
men.

2271
01:02:20,221 --> 01:02:20,461
No.

2272
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:23,010
You know what it is the
risk for reward for them.

2273
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,090
It's not worth it.

2274
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:24,840
What are they going to do?

2275
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,390
They're going to make a couple hundred
people happy if they do it and what's the

2276
01:02:27,391 --> 01:02:27,781
risk?

2277
01:02:27,781 --> 01:02:30,780
The risk is they get known as
a prostitution established.

2278
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:33,090
They get fucked and
they lose their license.

2279
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:33,871
That's the risk.

2280
01:02:33,871 --> 01:02:34,141
It's like,

2281
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:36,810
why would they do that for your
silly little fucking comedy show?

2282
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:37,860
Silly boy.

2283
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:39,980
Nonbusiness sense having motherfucker.

2284
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,510
This is my business had been
in vegas for 17 fucking years.

2285
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:43,260
Dislocation.

2286
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:43,411
Yeah.

2287
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:44,530
Do it with a French accent.

2288
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:45,340
Cheetahs.

2289
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,173
Not French guy.

2290
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,120
Then they cannot do this now.

2291
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,050
The French are freaks,

2292
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:49,670
man.

2293
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:50,140
Fuck.

2294
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:50,980
They don't give a fuck.

2295
01:02:50,981 --> 01:02:51,531
I don't give a fuck.

2296
01:02:51,531 --> 01:02:54,060
Have you been to a strip
bar and a la lately?

2297
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:54,450
No.

2298
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:55,230
They're horrible.

2299
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,280
Really horrible.

2300
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:56,931
It's been hard.

2301
01:02:56,931 --> 01:03:00,030
It's never been a good one and there's
no number that bit that I used to do

2302
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:01,470
about the star strip.

2303
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:01,951
Unless you.

2304
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:02,310
Annika.

2305
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:03,060
No,

2306
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:04,380
it was a true fucking story.

2307
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,970
The girls dancing and I asked her.

2308
01:03:05,971 --> 01:03:06,211
I go,

2309
01:03:06,211 --> 01:03:06,990
Hey,

2310
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:07,830
is this fun for you?

2311
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:08,693
Do you like doing this?

2312
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,180
She goes,

2313
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:09,991
I don't talk to guys.

2314
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:11,640
You come here and I go,

2315
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:12,020
well,

2316
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:12,390
why not?

2317
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:12,840
She goes,

2318
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:12,961
well,

2319
01:03:12,961 --> 01:03:13,740
you know what?

2320
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,480
Most of the guys who
come here are assholes,

2321
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:16,950
so I don't talk to guys to come here.

2322
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:17,491
And I go,

2323
01:03:17,491 --> 01:03:17,671
well,

2324
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:18,391
it's an open door.

2325
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:18,640
I mean,

2326
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,240
like Nice people come into it at all,

2327
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:20,910
you know?

2328
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:21,421
And she goes,

2329
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:21,780
well,

2330
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,010
the only come here for one reason.

2331
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:23,580
I mean like,

2332
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,420
why'd you come in here?

2333
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:25,291
And I go,

2334
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:27,820
because somebody told me there was a
place that I could go where I could see a

2335
01:03:27,821 --> 01:03:29,980
strange girl's pussy for A.

2336
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:29,981
Oh,

2337
01:03:29,981 --> 01:03:30,591
I remember that.

2338
01:03:30,591 --> 01:03:31,140
I remember that bit.

2339
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,820
That's a true story
that really did happen.

2340
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:33,301
I was like,

2341
01:03:33,301 --> 01:03:34,500
what a gross conversation.

2342
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,040
I just,

2343
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:35,873
you dancing if,

2344
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,230
if you don't want to talk to me,

2345
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:37,861
just say,

2346
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:38,510
you know,

2347
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:38,760
uh,

2348
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,260
I would prefer to be silent or something.

2349
01:03:40,261 --> 01:03:40,830
But see,

2350
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:41,940
most guys are assholes.

2351
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:42,420
Like,

2352
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:42,841
okay,

2353
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:43,230
I get it.

2354
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:43,531
I get,

2355
01:03:43,531 --> 01:03:44,610
this is not fun all the time,

2356
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:45,390
but I'm nice.

2357
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:46,223
I'm being nice to you.

2358
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:46,610
Yeah,

2359
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:46,980
sure.

2360
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,780
There's a lot dick's going in there,

2361
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:49,620
but it's like,

2362
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:50,580
that's your job.

2363
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:50,850
I mean,

2364
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:52,540
it's like there's a bit of sales,

2365
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,760
but you should totally open up a club in.

2366
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:58,210
It's called Houston's and fly just there.

2367
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:01,900
All the girls there are just from
Texas and they get flown in every week.

2368
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,360
We're going to be cool.

2369
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:03,710
No,

2370
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:04,070
it wouldn't be.

2371
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,810
Why wouldn't be a bunch
of fucking problems.

2372
01:04:06,811 --> 01:04:07,470
That's what you got.

2373
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:07,811
I mean if you.

2374
01:04:07,811 --> 01:04:08,644
If you want to.

2375
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,370
What it is is these are
people that are broken.

2376
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:11,940
That's what it is.

2377
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:15,180
I mean the reason why this girls
angry at work is not because not even

2378
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:16,680
necessarily because so
many guys are assholes,

2379
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:19,470
which I'm sure they are just because
the reason why she's fucking got her

2380
01:04:19,471 --> 01:04:21,990
asshole in front of your face
in the first place she's broken.

2381
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:25,890
Something happened is poor girl when she
was younger and she's all fucked up and

2382
01:04:25,891 --> 01:04:28,440
most likely molested and then here we go.

2383
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:31,020
There's good la club or there's
good strip clubs though.

2384
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:35,340
You enjoy going to good strip clubs in
la or just completely broken because of

2385
01:04:35,341 --> 01:04:35,971
the actress thing.

2386
01:04:35,971 --> 01:04:36,600
Exactly,

2387
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:41,600
and less and less as I can only enjoy
it with a bunch of people and less and

2388
01:04:41,891 --> 01:04:43,260
less and less and less.

2389
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:45,660
I enjoyed then when I was younger
and it's just because I do the math,

2390
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,260
you know,

2391
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:49,350
he'd do that whole fucking Buddhist thing
where you start to think about what is

2392
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:50,370
the cause and effect,

2393
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:51,150
what is the,

2394
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:55,620
what is the initial starting point
for this per the current behavior.

2395
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,840
Or you have a couple of drinks
and you just go stare at Ted's.

2396
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,580
Do you hear about the
place in North Dakota?

2397
01:04:59,581 --> 01:05:03,990
There's a city where they've like some
mining city where the girls are stripping

2398
01:05:03,991 --> 01:05:06,480
and they're making $3,500 a night course.

2399
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:10,860
They got so much money and there's like
five chicks in the whole entire town and

2400
01:05:10,861 --> 01:05:11,694
they're taking.

2401
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:15,240
They're taking in applications
from all around the world,

2402
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:18,330
like Russia a check chicks.

2403
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,410
Oh yeah.

2404
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,220
I was talking to some dudes up in Canada.

2405
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:22,054
We were working,

2406
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,670
we were in grand prairie
and some shit like that.

2407
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:25,810
And we're way the fuck up there.

2408
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,210
And they were talking to us about the,

2409
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:28,541
the,

2410
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:29,110
um,

2411
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:32,200
there's a lot of dudes that work up there
in the minds and that there's nothing

2412
01:05:32,201 --> 01:05:32,771
to do up there.

2413
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:33,880
And they make a shitload of money,

2414
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:36,510
shitloads of money to shit.

2415
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,720
Loads of cash.

2416
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,500
That was my job when I her up.

2417
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,590
They come in from Europe for gigs there.

2418
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:41,861
Yeah.

2419
01:05:41,861 --> 01:05:42,910
I have rules with women.

2420
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:45,340
I won't fuck three types
of chicks under age,

2421
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:48,840
married or Russian chicks
to the Russian dude.

2422
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,241
One,

2423
01:05:49,241 --> 01:05:50,890
they may not be there by choice.

2424
01:05:50,891 --> 01:05:51,724
And two,

2425
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:52,930
you don't know man.

2426
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:54,490
Those chicks are just as crazy,

2427
01:05:54,491 --> 01:05:54,731
man.

2428
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:55,271
They come in,

2429
01:05:55,271 --> 01:05:57,880
they'll slice and dice and
motherfuckers the craziest,

2430
01:05:57,881 --> 01:06:01,660
which I ever used to fuck around
with was a Ukrainian girl.

2431
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:02,440
Right.

2432
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,720
She was wild.

2433
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,150
I still beat off to that girl and
they always want to get married.

2434
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,610
Like after like two months,

2435
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:09,870
I need a ring.

2436
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,380
Put a ring on this finger.

2437
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:11,790
Yeah.

2438
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:13,450
Well she was a second generation,

2439
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:14,560
but God damn,

2440
01:06:14,561 --> 01:06:15,930
this bitch was a freak.

2441
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:18,460
Like the craziest white girls,

2442
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:20,350
black girls.

2443
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:21,011
But they're there.

2444
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:21,850
They're just like,

2445
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:22,580
they have a.

2446
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:25,480
they're a much hardier stock
than your average white girl.

2447
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:30,510
It's like almost like there's almost
like a different species and the men too,

2448
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:31,090
you know,

2449
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:33,140
if you look at guys like fate or and.

2450
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:33,690
Oh,

2451
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,950
or the fucking hard Russian men.

2452
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,500
There's some fucking hard Russian men.

2453
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:40,000
They always had that country's strength.

2454
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:40,510
Yeah.

2455
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:41,051
It's like,

2456
01:06:41,051 --> 01:06:41,381
yeah,

2457
01:06:41,381 --> 01:06:42,580
like a whole country full of Matt.

2458
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:45,970
He uses faith just like they look
like they fight grizzly bears.

2459
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:46,720
It's a tough.

2460
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,051
I mean,

2461
01:06:47,051 --> 01:06:47,261
look,

2462
01:06:47,261 --> 01:06:48,450
there's Russian pussies,

2463
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,140
just like,

2464
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:49,580
you know,

2465
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,291
American pussies.

2466
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:51,670
They're all kinds of
pussies in this world,

2467
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:55,270
but Russians are some
fucking tough fucking people,

2468
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:55,600
man.

2469
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:55,931
Yeah,

2470
01:06:55,931 --> 01:06:56,291
they are.

2471
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:57,910
They've been through some crazy shit.

2472
01:06:57,911 --> 01:06:58,744
Armenians.

2473
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:00,340
Armenians are nuts.

2474
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,560
Some people are fucking people,

2475
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:03,360
man.

2476
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,690
Out of Armenian fighters,

2477
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:05,060
dude.

2478
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,280
Lot of MMA fighters,

2479
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:07,243
lot of Moitai,

2480
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,260
Armenian fighters.

2481
01:07:08,261 --> 01:07:09,670
A lot of medium boxers,

2482
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:10,810
taxi drivers.

2483
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:12,200
When you think of anything.

2484
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,450
When I moved to La,

2485
01:07:13,451 --> 01:07:16,240
that was the weirdest thing
because where I was from the,

2486
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:16,930
you know,

2487
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:19,180
the means where I'm from are very like,

2488
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:21,370
they look like white
people right out here.

2489
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,720
They're very Persian army.

2490
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:23,290
Where are you from?

2491
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,450
The upstate New York and
they look like white people.

2492
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:25,841
They look,

2493
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:27,030
if you looked at all my aunts,

2494
01:07:27,031 --> 01:07:27,400
you'd be like,

2495
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:27,671
Oh,

2496
01:07:27,671 --> 01:07:28,720
a couple of my aunts were like,

2497
01:07:28,721 --> 01:07:28,901
wow,

2498
01:07:28,901 --> 01:07:29,681
those are white people.

2499
01:07:29,681 --> 01:07:31,300
You would never know they were Armenian.

2500
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:31,600
Where did,

2501
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,170
how did uh,

2502
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:36,260
Amenia get it's Armenia Armenian night.

2503
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,960
How did they get there?

2504
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,240
They're like their ethnicity,

2505
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:41,021
like what do they come from?

2506
01:07:41,021 --> 01:07:43,990
Is it a mix of Filipinos
are Chinese and Spanish,

2507
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:47,140
like out here they're mostly a Persian,

2508
01:07:47,141 --> 01:07:47,711
Armenian,

2509
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:48,544
Persian army,

2510
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:49,481
Persians.

2511
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:50,680
But the country,

2512
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:51,180
uh,

2513
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,540
adopted Christianity.

2514
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:56,200
So it became it's own little thing and
it never really got along with any of.

2515
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:57,770
It's like neighbor.

2516
01:07:57,771 --> 01:08:01,870
So it was the Persians came into
Iran and then became Christians.

2517
01:08:01,871 --> 01:08:02,704
Know the Persians.

2518
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:03,041
Yeah.

2519
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,290
Well it was one whole thing.

2520
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:04,480
I mean,

2521
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,060
I came into Armenia and
then became a Christian.

2522
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:11,350
The country was the first country
that ever adopt Christianity as it's

2523
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:12,430
countries.

2524
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:13,263
Uh,

2525
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,350
official religion.

2526
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:14,711
So,

2527
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:15,110
okay.

2528
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:16,150
There's like

2529
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:16,881
the darker,

2530
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:18,890
more Middle Eastern Looking Armenians.

2531
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:19,820
And then there's more like,

2532
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:20,140
like,

2533
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:20,980
like European,

2534
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:21,843
European,

2535
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,180
very light skin,

2536
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,160
very light skinned.

2537
01:08:24,161 --> 01:08:25,310
You would never know.

2538
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:26,810
Did they take you the same way though?

2539
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:27,530
Because I know that there's,

2540
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:28,790
like with Mexicans,

2541
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:30,860
there's a big difference in Mexico.

2542
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:32,840
Coconuts will you get with Mexicans,

2543
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:37,100
you get dudes who look like Oscar de
la Hoya or Salma Hayek who looked very

2544
01:08:37,101 --> 01:08:38,060
Spanish,

2545
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:39,200
very European,

2546
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:43,430
or then you get dudes who
look more like Indians.

2547
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,860
Really more like native Americans
because that's the real bloodline.

2548
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,780
Like the Mayans.

2549
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:51,530
What about the one Mexican boxer
who looks red headed Irish?

2550
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:51,911
Oh yeah,

2551
01:08:51,911 --> 01:08:52,040
yeah,

2552
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:52,500

2553
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,990
Just bought Lucy did
lucy case Mexican too?

2554
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:57,741
Isn't that crazy?

2555
01:08:57,741 --> 01:08:57,980
Yeah.

2556
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:58,880
He was born in Mexico.

2557
01:08:58,890 --> 01:08:59,723
He's Mexican.

2558
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:00,680
Not Born in Mexico,

2559
01:09:00,681 --> 01:09:01,310
but he's Mexican.

2560
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,143
Wow.

2561
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,091
I never knew that.

2562
01:09:03,091 --> 01:09:06,230
That's what he has a joke about how he's
more Mexican than Carl has been seeing

2563
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,160
and he really is.

2564
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:07,401
I mean,

2565
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:08,720
Louis is Mexican.

2566
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:09,853
Yeah.

2567
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:10,760
Very fascinating.

2568
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,180
Just how.

2569
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:12,780
No,

2570
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:13,000
no,

2571
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,390
no.

2572
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:14,223
I don't know.

2573
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:15,380
I don't know.

2574
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,490
He's got a lot of Mexican animal,

2575
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:17,470
but um,

2576
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:18,081
there's a,

2577
01:09:18,081 --> 01:09:19,790
there's a very distinct look that,

2578
01:09:19,791 --> 01:09:20,120
uh,

2579
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,500
some Mexicans have,

2580
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:22,150
you know,

2581
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:22,400
it's,

2582
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,180
it's more of an American
Indian look know sort of.

2583
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:27,690
When I went to mek combination,

2584
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,440
I went to Mexico City
to see metallica and uh,

2585
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:35,840
we flew in and my friends were already
there and we didn't know what to do.

2586
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:36,700
So we're like,

2587
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,000
oh no one's here to pick us up.

2588
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:38,930
We were going to go.

2589
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:39,860
We were like,

2590
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:40,461
we need a ride.

2591
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:42,440
So we find a taxi and it gets shady.

2592
01:09:42,441 --> 01:09:44,930
Dude detects drivers like follow me man.

2593
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:49,400
We walked through the airport and as we
get through the airport we keep walking

2594
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:50,840
and gets more and more third world,

2595
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:51,920
so I'm not lying to you.

2596
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,370
Eventually were walking out the airport
through this back alley where there's

2597
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:57,890
these chickens all running
around and I'm like,

2598
01:09:57,891 --> 01:10:00,020
this is not going right man.

2599
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,310
And we got into the car.

2600
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:04,610
I made a video of it and he drove around
and like that's the worst thing you can

2601
01:10:04,611 --> 01:10:09,611
do in Mexico City is getting a
taxi because they will kidnap you.

2602
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,090
They'll drive you somewhere,

2603
01:10:11,091 --> 01:10:14,480
they'll take you in the hold you for a
couple of days until they drain your atm

2604
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,730
and if you're lucky
they'll let you come back.

2605
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,631
But I don't know.

2606
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:18,441
This guy liked us,

2607
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:21,650
we started talking about hookers and
all that stuff because there's something

2608
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:24,560
about me whenever I land to
do stand up or do somewhere,

2609
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,351
I always asked,

2610
01:10:25,351 --> 01:10:26,300
so what's going on in this town?

2611
01:10:26,301 --> 01:10:28,370
And they always tell me
where the hookers are.

2612
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:29,450
The immediately,

2613
01:10:29,451 --> 01:10:30,950
the first thing they
always tell me is like,

2614
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:31,251
oh,

2615
01:10:31,251 --> 01:10:32,540
you can get some girls over here.

2616
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:33,680
I don't know what it is.

2617
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:34,760
You seem like a party guy.

2618
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,520
I see,

2619
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,250
but do I look like I need hookers?

2620
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:37,791
Yes.

2621
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:38,370
Yes.

2622
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:38,890
Really?

2623
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:39,190
Yeah,

2624
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:40,023
absolutely.

2625
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:41,030
I mean that's cool.

2626
01:10:41,031 --> 01:10:42,080
That's a cool color.

2627
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:45,290
You'd like him like you could
tell like I don't want to.

2628
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,480
I just want to talk to
them and get to know them.

2629
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:49,220
And the hooker whisper.

2630
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:49,821
Yeah.

2631
01:10:49,821 --> 01:10:51,830
Mexico is a very tricky place.

2632
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,570
Last time I was there I was in Cancun.

2633
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,320
It was a few years back and I remember
landing and walking through the airport

2634
01:10:57,321 --> 01:11:01,340
and just all these people like coming
at you to try to give you a ride.

2635
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:02,061
And I was like,

2636
01:11:02,061 --> 01:11:03,890
well we are a ride already
range where I was like,

2637
01:11:03,891 --> 01:11:05,180
this is gross man.

2638
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:05,641
Like you,

2639
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:05,950
you,

2640
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:06,260
like,

2641
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:07,580
you can't move through them.

2642
01:11:07,581 --> 01:11:08,390
Like I'm walking,

2643
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:10,840
pulling my bags and like
one after the other unit.

2644
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:11,121
All right,

2645
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:11,401
here.

2646
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:11,780
I know,

2647
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:12,220
right?

2648
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:12,870
Sorry.

2649
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:13,850
Under eyes are

2650
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,410
holding up their fucking
sign and it's like,

2651
01:11:16,411 --> 01:11:16,681
wow,

2652
01:11:16,681 --> 01:11:17,730
this is weird.

2653
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,870
I'm uncomfortable here.

2654
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:19,741
You realize like,

2655
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:19,951
Whoa,

2656
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:20,370
this is.

2657
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:21,600
They're playing by different rules.

2658
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,880
It's a third world country son.

2659
01:11:23,881 --> 01:11:24,950
You can call it canned coon.

2660
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:25,650
All you want.

2661
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:28,680
You just landed in a place
where laws don't apply.

2662
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:29,710
Everything's different mean.

2663
01:11:29,711 --> 01:11:30,541
Some laws apply,

2664
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:31,410
but it's not the same.

2665
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:31,951
You know,

2666
01:11:31,951 --> 01:11:34,560
everything's run by
fucking violent drug gangs.

2667
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:35,370
You know there's,

2668
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:36,800
I mean they have a short.

2669
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:37,800
They have a military presence.

2670
01:11:37,801 --> 01:11:38,634
Sure they have police,

2671
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:41,100
but the fucking drug gangs in Mexico are.

2672
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,030
They run every,

2673
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:42,571
everything,

2674
01:11:42,571 --> 01:11:44,220
every spec in there near the border.

2675
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:44,930
You go to the

2676
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:46,060
even have our weapons.

2677
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:49,540
They ended up busting them
with our military weapons.

2678
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,990
Is that when you realize how fucking
nutty these government agents are,

2679
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:55,280
did you hear about that?

2680
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:56,061
What's it called?

2681
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:57,440
Operation fast and furious.

2682
01:11:57,570 --> 01:11:58,490
It was like,

2683
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,640
do you think we give it to
them or they just end up.

2684
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:04,880
Because we'd like to destabilize regions.

2685
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:06,980
Oh,

2686
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:07,910
100 percent.

2687
01:12:07,911 --> 01:12:09,200
We played both sides.

2688
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:09,561
We,

2689
01:12:09,561 --> 01:12:10,190
we,

2690
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:12,770
because guns turned up
in El Paso to the guns.

2691
01:12:12,771 --> 01:12:15,740
They turned up in crimes
that were used in El Paso,

2692
01:12:15,741 --> 01:12:19,820
so the guns that the atf sold
to the Mexican drug traffickers,

2693
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,190
those fucking guns
showed up in our country,

2694
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,060
so those,

2695
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:25,570
those guns could have easily
been used to kill Americans.

2696
01:12:25,571 --> 01:12:26,031
Civilians,

2697
01:12:26,031 --> 01:12:28,940
because our fucking government is
completely incompetent and retarded.

2698
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:33,260
Two thousand weapons were trafficked
along the US Mexico border and many were

2699
01:12:33,261 --> 01:12:37,430
using violent crimes in Mexico
and in addition to Ak 47,

2700
01:12:37,431 --> 01:12:41,150
semiautomatics involved in the program
were recovered after a US border.

2701
01:12:41,151 --> 01:12:42,980
Agent was killed south of Tucson.

2702
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:43,340
Wow.

2703
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:46,160
A US fucking border agent was
killed with one of these weapons.

2704
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:50,390
So under the program dub fast and
furious agents with the Federal Bureau of

2705
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,391
Alcohol,

2706
01:12:50,391 --> 01:12:50,841
tobacco,

2707
01:12:50,841 --> 01:12:55,841
and firearms and explosives in the Phoenix
field office allowed licensed firearm

2708
01:12:56,271 --> 01:13:01,271
dealers to sell weapons to illegal
straw buyers in the hope that the agents

2709
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:04,400
could track the weapons and arrest
Mexican drug cartel leaders.

2710
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,300
That was their walkie
fucking dopey ass idea.

2711
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:13,100
They were going to allow the fucking
Mexican drug cartels to get more weapons.

2712
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,730
Did they have gps things
at home or something?

2713
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:17,720
Then that kind of makes sense.

2714
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:20,790
If you give a bunch of
guns and you watched,

2715
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,001
that's dumb.

2716
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:22,751
They know where they are.

2717
01:13:22,751 --> 01:13:23,710
They already know where they are there.

2718
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,491
Where the drug guys.

2719
01:13:24,491 --> 01:13:25,960
Are they a fucking ranches man?

2720
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:27,940
These guys are to be bro.

2721
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:28,221
Yo.

2722
01:13:28,221 --> 01:13:29,720
They have dollars.

2723
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:31,111
So you never know.

2724
01:13:31,111 --> 01:13:36,040
Like there was a whole theory that they
want to really like bankrupt Mexico.

2725
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,760
Have you ever heard of the marrow?

2726
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,250
You buy into that at all?

2727
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,060
I heard about it,

2728
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:40,230
yeah.

2729
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:41,230
Like the whole thing was just.

2730
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,210
We actually had it on CNN.

2731
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:47,650
I think about just like how they're trying
to like make like Mexico is broke as

2732
01:13:47,651 --> 01:13:52,090
shit and then America broke as shit and
then bring down Canada with us and then

2733
01:13:52,091 --> 01:13:52,630
everything's.

2734
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:53,441
Our money's worth.

2735
01:13:53,441 --> 01:13:54,930
Nothing that they just get rid of are.

2736
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,220
It's the Amiro think that's possible.

2737
01:13:57,221 --> 01:14:00,580
Do you think that the government
actually plots to crash the economy?

2738
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,090
Absolute incompetence.

2739
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:04,990
I don't think that they
plot to crash shit.

2740
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:08,250
I do think that the
powers that be crashed,

2741
01:14:08,251 --> 01:14:11,770
the market so they can buy everything
cheaper and then it goes up and they buy

2742
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:12,250
more and

2743
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,570
I definitely think that.

2744
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:13,961
Okay.

2745
01:14:13,961 --> 01:14:14,380
Yeah.

2746
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:18,640
Well I definitely think that people short
stocks and they manipulate the market

2747
01:14:18,641 --> 01:14:21,190
and do stuff like that
to get kids to get money,

2748
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:22,300
but those aren't.

2749
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:24,640
That's not necessarily the same
people that are the government.

2750
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:25,270
These are,

2751
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:27,700
this is people that are
involved in the market.

2752
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:31,930
The market sort of pays for the government
to get the government to do certain

2753
01:14:31,931 --> 01:14:36,931
things their way that helped them and
them and stealing money and make sure

2754
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:38,130
there's a lot of clauses.

2755
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:40,570
They get away a lot of shady
shit completely legally,

2756
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,210
but I don't think they're plotting.

2757
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:43,960
Here's my theory over the,

2758
01:14:43,961 --> 01:14:44,321
you know,

2759
01:14:44,321 --> 01:14:44,981
the economy.

2760
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:45,814
I think that's kind of.

2761
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:47,470
You ever watched the first 48?

2762
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:48,693
Yes.

2763
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,730
You ever see somebody kill
somebody over $20 worth of crack?

2764
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,420
Yeah.

2765
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:52,961
And you're like,

2766
01:14:52,961 --> 01:14:54,430
well those are just thugs and gals,

2767
01:14:54,431 --> 01:14:55,420
but they're people.

2768
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:56,680
They're wired certain ways.

2769
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:58,120
You're looking at the government,

2770
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,700
you're looking at people who
are dealing with tr billions,

2771
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:02,350
if not trillions of dollars.

2772
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,520
I just don't think they're going to
let you know a flip of a coin to decide

2773
01:15:06,521 --> 01:15:09,490
where that money goes and that they
could have some problem with manipulating

2774
01:15:09,491 --> 01:15:09,850
shit.

2775
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:11,140
I'm not saying that's what happens,

2776
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:16,141
but I would never ever put a pass somebody
to manipulate something for a ton of

2777
01:15:16,631 --> 01:15:17,110
money.

2778
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:17,351
Yeah,

2779
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:17,741
maybe.

2780
01:15:17,741 --> 01:15:18,401
But you know what?

2781
01:15:18,401 --> 01:15:21,040
There's too many people would have to
be involved in rigging the whole economy

2782
01:15:21,041 --> 01:15:23,530
to collapse and then you'd have to
figure out who the hell's gonna profit on

2783
01:15:23,531 --> 01:15:25,030
this and then you'd have
to follow the money.

2784
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,103
Here's the,

2785
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:26,440
the,

2786
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,040
the.

2787
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,260
There's no mystery why things collapsed.

2788
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:29,980
There's no mystery.

2789
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,760
There was a god damn money grab and they,

2790
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:35,470
they knew that it was temporary
and they went crazy and they made,

2791
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:36,190
you know,

2792
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:36,361
the,

2793
01:15:36,361 --> 01:15:41,361
the whole economy for Julie based
on nothing based on nonsense,

2794
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:44,950
but slowly but surely not least
on gold up based on anything.

2795
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,390
It's all based on craziness.

2796
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:47,350
And then there's derivatives,

2797
01:15:47,351 --> 01:15:50,650
and I read this mat tie eeb article we
just talking about the derivative economy

2798
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:52,870
being like 100 times larger
than the regular economy.

2799
01:15:52,871 --> 01:15:55,030
Whatever the fuck that means like it's it,

2800
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:57,970
it gets so fucking squirrely.

2801
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:58,540
So they,

2802
01:15:58,540 --> 01:15:59,480
they know what,

2803
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:00,460
what went wrong.

2804
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:05,230
It's not like someone's sabotage it on
purpose so that they can profit from it

2805
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:09,430
and that they could slowly devalue the
dollar so they can combine the countries

2806
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:09,980
together.

2807
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:10,370
You know,

2808
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:11,800
there's no profit in that man.

2809
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:12,340
There's no,

2810
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:15,250
there's no ultimate profit and
creating one giant country.

2811
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:15,790
There are.

2812
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:16,390
I've listened.

2813
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:17,011
I'm not saying.

2814
01:16:17,011 --> 01:16:18,970
I guess I would say that's
the theory out there.

2815
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,591
I'm not,

2816
01:16:19,591 --> 01:16:20,120
I the,

2817
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,010
it's beyond,

2818
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:21,873
but I wouldn't,

2819
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,320
I wouldn't put it past anybody.

2820
01:16:23,321 --> 01:16:25,210
I mean you're talking about
because when they do that,

2821
01:16:25,211 --> 01:16:27,110
supposedly what's going to have to happen,

2822
01:16:27,111 --> 01:16:28,870
and this is such a radical thing,

2823
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,750
but it would be like you
would scrap the constitution,

2824
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:34,930
you'd have to scrap the constitution
and have done that anyway.

2825
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:36,220
They've sort of done that anyway.

2826
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:40,210
Slowly but surely this will be a direct
light parts of freedom of speech.

2827
01:16:40,211 --> 01:16:41,680
Parts of the Second Amendment,

2828
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:45,190
the right to bear arms has
been compromised significantly
in this country and

2829
01:16:45,191 --> 01:16:46,800
more and more now that the,

2830
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,470
the they were trying to do with the vapor,

2831
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:49,871
with,

2832
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:50,170
um,

2833
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:51,010
medical marijuana,

2834
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:53,080
they trying to make it so that
if you have medical marijuana,

2835
01:16:53,081 --> 01:16:55,630
you're not allowed to possess a gun
anymore or you're not a lot of buy a new

2836
01:16:55,631 --> 01:16:56,320
gun.

2837
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,160
It's ridiculous.

2838
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,023
It's ridiculous.

2839
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:58,411
They're there.

2840
01:16:58,411 --> 01:16:59,860
They're fucking with people's rights,

2841
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:04,240
inalienable rights as non criminals
in the United States of America,

2842
01:17:04,241 --> 01:17:04,961
as hunters,

2843
01:17:04,961 --> 01:17:05,400
as,

2844
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,730
as people that want to go target shooting.

2845
01:17:06,731 --> 01:17:08,740
It's whatever you know you're
saying because someone uses medical,

2846
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,400
they shouldn't be allowed to.

2847
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:11,570
What about oxycodone?

2848
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:12,440
You got that on your list?

2849
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:12,591
No,

2850
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:13,050
you don't.

2851
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:13,940
I'll go fuck yourself.

2852
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:14,151
Yeah.

2853
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:15,500
That's fucking criminals.

2854
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:15,800
Like,

2855
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,880
did she go to jail for that dude just for
even suggesting that medical marijuana

2856
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:24,170
should be something that you should
lose your gun for and not oxycontin and

2857
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,870
Vicodin and not a regular drinker.

2858
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:27,860
Fuck you.

2859
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:28,850
You going on your purse?

2860
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:30,740
So transparent man,

2861
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:34,310
that is one of the most transparent
pieces of corruption the world has ever

2862
01:17:34,311 --> 01:17:34,820
seen.

2863
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:39,110
The idea that the fucking atf is going
to go after potheads before they go after

2864
01:17:39,111 --> 01:17:40,250
pharmaceutical companies.

2865
01:17:40,251 --> 01:17:41,240
Alcohol companies.

2866
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,250
You're going to go after
people who smoke pot.

2867
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,390
They're the ones who can't have guns.

2868
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:48,380
Well then what about Obama and his
administration now trying to shut down all

2869
01:17:48,381 --> 01:17:50,490
the dispensary's?

2870
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:50,870
Yeah,

2871
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:51,703
it's ridiculous.

2872
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:53,480
It's a bag of goods.

2873
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:56,950
It's all bullshit and they say it's
the Department of Justice or say

2874
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:01,130
I guess they're not listening to them.

2875
01:18:01,131 --> 01:18:01,780
I don't know.

2876
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:02,060
I mean,

2877
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:02,251
I don't.

2878
01:18:02,251 --> 01:18:03,200
I don't know how that works.

2879
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:03,561
I don't.

2880
01:18:03,561 --> 01:18:04,394
I don't know how much.

2881
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,090
Say the president really wants you.

2882
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:06,710
I don't.

2883
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:10,000
That's what I think happens is
he got in there he wanted like,

2884
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:10,401
yes,

2885
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:12,440
we can get in there real.

2886
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,330
It's all the bill Hicks whole thing.

2887
01:18:14,331 --> 01:18:17,910
They showed him a different fucking
view of the Kennedy assassination.

2888
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:19,880
It's even different than
the bill Hicks joke.

2889
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:23,570
It's like instead he thought he was
going to go there and he was going to get

2890
01:18:23,571 --> 01:18:26,660
into an office and he was going to be
able to change shit and when he got there,

2891
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:30,920
there's a bunch of people
feverously working to patch
up a hole in the middle of

2892
01:18:30,921 --> 01:18:32,270
the universe and they're like,

2893
01:18:32,271 --> 01:18:32,541
listen,

2894
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:32,841
this is what.

2895
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:35,640
You can only keep this together for
another fucking year or two and it's going

2896
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:35,961
to blow.

2897
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,220
It doesn't matter if the economy goes.

2898
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:38,510
Doesn't matter if we get cancer.

2899
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:38,740
This,

2900
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:39,890
this is fucking thing's going to blow.

2901
01:18:39,891 --> 01:18:40,200
This is a,

2902
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:40,501
there's a,

2903
01:18:40,501 --> 01:18:41,420
there's a hole in the universe.

2904
01:18:41,421 --> 01:18:42,200
We're trying to patch it up.

2905
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,810
We've got our boys holding it down and
they flew him out the fucking area.

2906
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:47,630
Fifty one and Nevada and he looked
at the whole university went fuck.

2907
01:18:47,631 --> 01:18:49,260
And then his hair slowly became gray.

2908
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,620
What do you wanna go after pot after pot.

2909
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:52,030
God,

2910
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:52,640
what do you want?

2911
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,121
Who Cares?

2912
01:18:53,121 --> 01:18:54,530
At this point in Pakistan?

2913
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,393
Where with Pakistan?

2914
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:56,091
Fuck it.

2915
01:18:56,091 --> 01:18:56,720
Why not?

2916
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,200
Iran?

2917
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,010
Iran as bombs.

2918
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:58,211
Let's,

2919
01:18:58,211 --> 01:19:01,040
let's bomb them first
fucking hole in the universe.

2920
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:01,953
Well,

2921
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,920
why not get gray quick?

2922
01:19:03,921 --> 01:19:04,580
Didn't,

2923
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:04,731
well,

2924
01:19:04,731 --> 01:19:05,001
you know,

2925
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:05,661
he looks better.

2926
01:19:05,661 --> 01:19:07,160
Most black don't crack,

2927
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:07,821
that's for sure.

2928
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:08,654
Because of the bush.

2929
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,350
Oh yeah,

2930
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,771
they do.

2931
01:19:09,771 --> 01:19:13,970
They didn't care because they started
seeing shit that we don't even know about.

2932
01:19:13,971 --> 01:19:14,804
They're just like,

2933
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:16,640
you hear what Bill Clinton said,

2934
01:19:16,641 --> 01:19:17,210
man.

2935
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:19,580
One of the craziest things that
he said about being in an office,

2936
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:20,990
it was about the moon landings.

2937
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:25,220
He said that when he was a kid just a
couple of months after the Apollo 11

2938
01:19:25,221 --> 01:19:25,910
landing,

2939
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:26,180
you know,

2940
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:30,050
he said that it was amazing that man put
a person on the moon and he worked with

2941
01:19:30,051 --> 01:19:30,884
his old carpenter.

2942
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:36,790
Carpenter said that he thought that that
was bs and that a television fellows,

2943
01:19:37,251 --> 01:19:38,270
because I don't believe a word of it,

2944
01:19:38,271 --> 01:19:41,780
those television fellers can try to get
you to believe anything I don't believe

2945
01:19:41,781 --> 01:19:42,614
man landed on the moon.

2946
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,870
And he said at the time I
thought that guy was a crank.

2947
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:45,531
He goes,

2948
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,360
but after eight years in the White House,

2949
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:50,030
just stop and think about that.

2950
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:52,580
Who did he say after eight
years in the White House?

2951
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:55,100
I started to think maybe
he was ahead of his time.

2952
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:58,160
This is the fucking president
the fucking president said that.

2953
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:02,480
Just imagine the shit that he saw where
he would even pretend that the moon

2954
01:20:02,481 --> 01:20:03,980
landings possibly could have been faked,

2955
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,380
that he would even
entertain that for a moment.

2956
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:11,740
I don't think we have a goddamn clue as
to what really creepy shit is going on

2957
01:20:14,011 --> 01:20:15,120
behind closed doors.

2958
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,470
When the farmers who shopped
pharmaceutical companies
talk about the amount of

2959
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:23,640
drugs that they produce every year that
they need to sell and how they upped the

2960
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:25,470
oxycontin every fucking year.

2961
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:25,850
You know,

2962
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:28,500
they've upped it so much since
we've been in Afghanistan too.

2963
01:20:28,501 --> 01:20:29,334
What a coincidence.

2964
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:30,600
Afghanistan producers,

2965
01:20:30,601 --> 01:20:32,900
all the heroin and that's where their
fucking getting it and that's where they

2966
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:37,920
make an oxycontin and we're over there
protecting it 100 percent and it's so

2967
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:40,570
funny that people don't
believe any of that,

2968
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:40,760
that,

2969
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:40,950
that,

2970
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:43,830
that they can't sit there
and as we told them,

2971
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:46,320
that their leaders might not
have their best interest.

2972
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:49,320
Especially when you're talking about
billions and billions and billions of

2973
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,990
dollars when you're talking about
just ridiculous sums of money.

2974
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,040
We're willing,

2975
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,690
we're willing to do some creepy shit.

2976
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,310
We're willing to do some creepy shit,

2977
01:20:56,311 --> 01:20:56,870
man.

2978
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:59,250
And they don't give a fuck man.

2979
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:00,690
I always question authority,

2980
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:01,110
man.

2981
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:01,651
Always.

2982
01:21:01,651 --> 01:21:03,060
I just think it's more fun.

2983
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:04,171
It's interesting.

2984
01:21:04,171 --> 01:21:04,591
Why keep,

2985
01:21:04,591 --> 01:21:05,610
make their jobs easier,

2986
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:08,670
but look how easily they
can justify what they do.

2987
01:21:08,671 --> 01:21:09,504
Like Obama had,

2988
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:12,720
there was some fucking one of those
speeches where they talked about,

2989
01:21:12,721 --> 01:21:12,861
uh,

2990
01:21:12,861 --> 01:21:13,290
you know,

2991
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:15,420
where it was like Obama
had jokes written for him,

2992
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:15,871
you know,

2993
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,840
and he had a joke about
his daughters and he said,

2994
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:21,420
I have a two words for you predator.

2995
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:22,253
Drone.

2996
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:24,030
Like he was joking,

2997
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,360
people dating his daughter that he
will send a Predator drone on you.

2998
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,760
What's kind of a fucked up joke.

2999
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:34,350
And then when you go look into how many
people have died using Predator drones,

3000
01:21:34,351 --> 01:21:37,080
how many innocent people
have done hundreds of them,

3001
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:37,740
including like,

3002
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:40,040
I think it was like 150 children.

3003
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,360
So children,

3004
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:42,870
small jokes.

3005
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:47,870
One hundred and 50 children have been
killed by things that are ultimately under

3006
01:21:48,031 --> 01:21:52,080
his control since he is the commander in
chief of the United States army and the

3007
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:52,771
United States military force.

3008
01:21:52,771 --> 01:21:53,010
Right?

3009
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:53,910
He's the commander in chief.

3010
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:54,310
Why don't you,

3011
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:57,150
so ultimately he's at the
top of the blame list.

3012
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:02,270
A hundred and 50 babies were killed by
missiles from a flying robot and he's

3013
01:22:03,931 --> 01:22:06,360
joking around about people
dating his daughter.

3014
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:07,740
One hundred percent and here's the whole.

3015
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:09,300
I've said I'm using a predator.

3016
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:10,250
Drones go after him,

3017
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,300
but here's the thing,

3018
01:22:12,301 --> 01:22:13,650
it's back to hand to hand combat.

3019
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:16,530
If you and I are going at
it and you see I give up,

3020
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:17,520
there's a sense of like,

3021
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:17,881
okay,

3022
01:22:17,881 --> 01:22:18,600
he's giving up,

3023
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,280
but if you're a thousand miles away,

3024
01:22:20,281 --> 01:22:21,690
you're not going to see me surrender.

3025
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:22,720
And it means nothing.

3026
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,570
There's no like the detachment.

3027
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:27,030
It's the same kind of detachment you get
on the Internet where you're allowed to

3028
01:22:27,031 --> 01:22:27,900
use like a fake name.

3029
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,300
Like this guy could talk about training
porn because he doesn't have to worry.

3030
01:22:30,301 --> 01:22:30,991
He's detached.

3031
01:22:30,991 --> 01:22:32,790
Or if someone could be
mean to you and you know,

3032
01:22:32,791 --> 01:22:34,930
they don't worry about the social
repercussions of being mean to you because

3033
01:22:34,931 --> 01:22:35,970
they don't say it was like a fuck.

3034
01:22:35,971 --> 01:22:36,410
You triple,

3035
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,141
you fucking suck.

3036
01:22:37,141 --> 01:22:39,340
You will read my comments

3037
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,770
against those or did you hear that?

3038
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:45,610
The founder of Facebook,

3039
01:22:45,611 --> 01:22:49,770
his sister is trying to make it so people
have to use their real names on the

3040
01:22:49,771 --> 01:22:50,360
Internet.

3041
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:51,660
I don't know if it'll ever happen.

3042
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:52,583
I don't like that.

3043
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:54,000
I think you should be
able do whatever you want.

3044
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:55,230
If you want to use your real name,

3045
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:55,891
your real name,

3046
01:22:55,891 --> 01:22:56,311
if you don't.

3047
01:22:56,311 --> 01:22:58,710
I think there should be places where
you have to use your real name.

3048
01:22:58,711 --> 01:22:59,880
Like I my message board,

3049
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:03,900
I would like it if you had your real face
and your real name and that's what we

3050
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:05,020
saw and that's you.

3051
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,930
That's that can't make that happen.

3052
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:07,990
I mean I guess I could,

3053
01:23:07,991 --> 01:23:08,421
but I don't.

3054
01:23:08,421 --> 01:23:11,380
I don't want to be censoring
people and if that was the case,

3055
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:14,530
people wouldn't be able to post shit
because of what they do for a living.

3056
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:17,320
Like there's some people that have asked
me to change their screen names because

3057
01:23:17,321 --> 01:23:18,154
their screen name,

3058
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,100
somebody from work found
out their screen names,

3059
01:23:20,101 --> 01:23:23,830
so they asked me to change their screen
name so that they couldn't get some

3060
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:25,690
fucking tattle tattletale at work.

3061
01:23:25,691 --> 01:23:26,081
Couldn't go.

3062
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:26,321
Yeah.

3063
01:23:26,321 --> 01:23:29,350
Bob's talking about
tranny porn doesn't work.

3064
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,070
Look at the times where he's logged on,

3065
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,290
just 4:00 PM is working.

3066
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:34,240
If we're talking about
young people do that Shit,

3067
01:23:34,241 --> 01:23:34,511
man.

3068
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:36,850
It's so much track tracking to nowadays,

3069
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:37,451
like twitter,

3070
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:37,961
facebook,

3071
01:23:37,961 --> 01:23:39,400
everything you post.

3072
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:42,370
How many times have you used twitter
would ask you use your location?

3073
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:42,780
Yeah.

3074
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:44,980
They want to use my,

3075
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:45,340
the,

3076
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:46,180
my latest phone.

3077
01:23:46,181 --> 01:23:47,770
Has that turned on immediately?

3078
01:23:47,771 --> 01:23:49,630
Like I didn't even do it and I'm like,

3079
01:23:49,631 --> 01:23:49,871
great.

3080
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:50,980
Did I just like tweet?

3081
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:51,820
Did you get a forecast?

3082
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:52,130
Yeah,

3083
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:52,410
yeah,

3084
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:52,710
yeah,

3085
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:53,070
it has.

3086
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:53,970
It has that shit on it.

3087
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:54,630
Yeah.

3088
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:55,290
Yeah,

3089
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:56,010
it's creepy.

3090
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:56,843
It is creepy.

3091
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,320
I mean I just think people are.

3092
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:02,010
I mean because there's no ramifications.

3093
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:02,340
True.

3094
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:05,130
And ultimately everything
comes down to accountability.

3095
01:24:05,131 --> 01:24:08,170
That's what I think we get
away from more and more in,

3096
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:09,390
in this society,

3097
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:11,070
especially in this country in which is,

3098
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:11,491
you know,

3099
01:24:11,491 --> 01:24:15,930
my whole thing is I wish they would say
that I occupy Wall Street or la is like,

3100
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,490
you want accountability,

3101
01:24:17,491 --> 01:24:17,821
man.

3102
01:24:17,821 --> 01:24:20,370
You want accountability
for everything you do.

3103
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:20,940
You know,

3104
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:21,900
whether it's government,

3105
01:24:21,901 --> 01:24:23,040
whether it's your personal,

3106
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:23,611
you know,

3107
01:24:23,611 --> 01:24:24,180
actions.

3108
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:26,610
It's accountability and that's
what they're asking for.

3109
01:24:26,611 --> 01:24:28,740
But no one will come out
and say that on that thing.

3110
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,400
So they all put out there,

3111
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:34,550
I fucked up and the whole thing's
falling apart and no one's going to jail.

3112
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:34,990
That's a.

3113
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:35,350
that's.

3114
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:39,260
That's a sure sign that the justice
system is not working properly.

3115
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:43,880
A sure sign that our elected leaders
are not going after the people that had

3116
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:44,900
created this problem.

3117
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:45,883
100.

3118
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,990
I gotTa stop saying that 100 percent,

3119
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,350
1000 percent fighting I should say.

3120
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,490
It's like a drinking game.

3121
01:24:52,491 --> 01:24:53,091
At this point.

3122
01:24:53,091 --> 01:24:55,480
People were drinking shots at this player,

3123
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:56,630
shit faced.

3124
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:58,640
Can you imagine in the future,

3125
01:24:58,641 --> 01:25:02,360
like if there was a movie that
that was designed like prior,

3126
01:25:02,361 --> 01:25:03,590
like Avatar or something like that,

3127
01:25:03,591 --> 01:25:07,370
like Cgi and every time you wash it
and going back to what you were talking

3128
01:25:07,371 --> 01:25:07,880
about earlier,

3129
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:11,000
every time you watched
it in a new partner,

3130
01:25:11,001 --> 01:25:14,780
a new scene was in the movie and it
was created randomly buy a computer

3131
01:25:14,781 --> 01:25:16,100
generated kind of like minecraft.

3132
01:25:16,101 --> 01:25:17,300
This video that could be possible.

3133
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:21,230
You could sit down and you can
sit down and watch star wars,

3134
01:25:21,231 --> 01:25:22,310
like a whole new thing,

3135
01:25:22,311 --> 01:25:23,150
version of star wars.

3136
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:27,380
Every time you watch it becomes like a
choose your own adventure movie where

3137
01:25:27,381 --> 01:25:30,850
it's like different choices give you
a different ending to the script.

3138
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:31,470
Yeah,

3139
01:25:31,470 --> 01:25:31,980
yeah,

3140
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:32,813
absolutely man.

3141
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:38,250
The future is going to be very strange
when it comes to what you can create,

3142
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:40,080
artificial environments
that you can create.

3143
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:41,640
The real question to me is like,

3144
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,050
what is gonna?

3145
01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:43,860
What's gonna?

3146
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:46,620
When is it going to be human stupidity?

3147
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,030
Or is it going to be technology?

3148
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:48,361
It's like,

3149
01:25:48,361 --> 01:25:50,460
it's almost like there's a
race to a final conclusion.

3150
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:52,710
Theology maybe,

3151
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:57,830
but we're also invading Pakistan and
Iran has got nukes and fucking with the

3152
01:25:58,261 --> 01:26:01,770
large Hadron collider and some new laser
they're proposing to build in Britain

3153
01:26:01,771 --> 01:26:04,140
that could punch a whole
new space time and that

3154
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,760
this is a weird race going
on and at the same time,

3155
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:08,560
you know,

3156
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,290
can you go again?

3157
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:11,650
So,

3158
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:14,090
so look what's going on in the Congo,

3159
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:15,440
look what's going on in Mexico.

3160
01:26:15,441 --> 01:26:16,100
Look what's going on.

3161
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:21,080
So many different parts of the world
where human lives are just falling apart.

3162
01:26:21,081 --> 01:26:23,330
Human civilization falling apart,

3163
01:26:23,331 --> 01:26:24,164
chaos,

3164
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:24,591
you know,

3165
01:26:24,591 --> 01:26:25,760
just ultimate chaos.

3166
01:26:25,761 --> 01:26:29,750
You look at like watch like documentaries
on parts of Africa and you would swear

3167
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:31,940
this is a post apocalyptic vision.

3168
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:37,240
Things they do like just
hacking or just to get there.

3169
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:38,630
I mean,

3170
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:43,280
it's crazy eating the flesh of
innocent children on the enemy side to,

3171
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:43,570
to,

3172
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:48,140
to be little vulnerable and battle
some of the stuff that I watched

3173
01:26:48,141 --> 01:26:49,370
documentaries on Liberia.

3174
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,350
They've stained my brain forever,

3175
01:26:51,351 --> 01:26:52,070
man.

3176
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,900
Cannibalism,

3177
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:53,451
rampant,

3178
01:26:53,451 --> 01:26:54,530
rampant cannibalism.

3179
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:54,920
You know,

3180
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:58,190
we're going to have Shane Smith
on the podcast from vice tv.

3181
01:26:58,420 --> 01:26:58,821
Um,

3182
01:26:58,821 --> 01:27:01,550
he's one of the guys who
went to Liberia and uh,

3183
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:03,350
who's the other guy
went to North Korea to.

3184
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:03,561
Yeah,

3185
01:27:03,561 --> 01:27:04,251
he's gone everywhere.

3186
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:05,720
But this mother fucker me about that.

3187
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:07,730
Recently they just watched me.

3188
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:09,010
I can't wait to have this guy on.

3189
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,130
I'm fucking so fired up.

3190
01:27:10,131 --> 01:27:10,510
He's,

3191
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:11,301
he's been everywhere.

3192
01:27:11,301 --> 01:27:12,710
He was just in Beirut and he's,

3193
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:13,371
he's traveling.

3194
01:27:13,371 --> 01:27:14,390
He travels all over the world,

3195
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:15,530
the darkest parts of the world.

3196
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:18,920
He says he has to get new passports all
the time because he brings his passport,

3197
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:20,270
the fuck Iraq,

3198
01:27:20,271 --> 01:27:20,871
Afghanistan,

3199
01:27:20,871 --> 01:27:20,991
like,

3200
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:21,824
what are you doing?

3201
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:22,491
And he's like,

3202
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:23,270
I'm a reporter,

3203
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:23,601
you know?

3204
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:24,080
And then they're like,

3205
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:24,501
for what?

3206
01:27:24,501 --> 01:27:24,741
He's like,

3207
01:27:24,741 --> 01:27:26,120
VBS and they're like CBS.

3208
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:26,391
He's like,

3209
01:27:26,391 --> 01:27:26,720
no.

3210
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,350
VBS.

3211
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:28,550
Like the fuck is vbs.

3212
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:29,360
So he just,

3213
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,540
whenever we go somewhere dark,

3214
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,790
it just gets a new passport.

3215
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:37,060
You're better off telling me about his
one in North Korea and how crazy it is.

3216
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:38,721
Yeah.

3217
01:27:38,721 --> 01:27:39,950
Well he said he's got some North Korea.

3218
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:41,480
He said N K slay footage.

3219
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,320
I didn't even know what that meant,

3220
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:43,640
but in the Internet schooled me,

3221
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:45,020
North Korea Douche.

3222
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:45,950
And I was like,

3223
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:46,521
Oh yeah,

3224
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:46,851
that's right.

3225
01:27:46,851 --> 01:27:47,211
People are like,

3226
01:27:47,211 --> 01:27:48,044
you seriously?

3227
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,040
They don't know what it is.

3228
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:50,180
I didn't know.

3229
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,590
I started trying to
think of what that meant.

3230
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,290
I never associated North Korea
with slaves for some reason.

3231
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:55,550
I didn't think that there would be slaves.

3232
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:56,630
Dude,

3233
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:59,450
I guarantee you that happens
more and more common,

3234
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:00,890
you know.

3235
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:02,030
And that's a whole thing about,

3236
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:02,330
you know,

3237
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:05,750
this whole free trade where they moved
their businesses over these third world

3238
01:28:05,751 --> 01:28:06,740
and your phone off the table.

3239
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:08,570
Everybody take your phone off the table,

3240
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:11,000
everybody keeps lowering lowering prices.

3241
01:28:11,001 --> 01:28:14,120
Eventually the Labor is going to be to
the point where they don't even want pay

3242
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:16,190
for Labor to keep the prices so low.

3243
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:18,200
Well,

3244
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:18,501
I mean,

3245
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:18,771
you know,

3246
01:28:18,771 --> 01:28:18,981
look,

3247
01:28:18,981 --> 01:28:20,240
we're willing to do that to dolphins.

3248
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:21,170
Yeah.

3249
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:22,100
Why Not Chinese people?

3250
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:23,150
I don't understand that either.

3251
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:23,600
You know?

3252
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:23,771
I mean,

3253
01:28:23,771 --> 01:28:24,020
that's,

3254
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:24,853
that's really helpful.

3255
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:26,540
If you ever go to China,

3256
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,100
you'll have the best time ever.

3257
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:29,690
China is the shit.

3258
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:30,530
What'd you do in China?

3259
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:32,810
I did stand up really idea.

3260
01:28:32,811 --> 01:28:33,740
It was the best time.

3261
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:35,660
I mean Steve Byrne or Steve Byrne and I,

3262
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:36,920
we went to Beijing.

3263
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:38,930
Shanghai loved it.

3264
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:42,060
What did you perform to American expats?

3265
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:43,460
How many people were in the crowd?

3266
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,440
A different shows are different sizes.

3267
01:28:45,441 --> 01:28:47,280
All white people in the crowd
or do some Chinese people?

3268
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:47,940
Everything.

3269
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:48,773
Really everything.

3270
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:50,090
What was the percentage of white people?

3271
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:50,750
Chinese people.

3272
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:50,991
Well,

3273
01:28:50,991 --> 01:28:52,550
at our shows it was very high.

3274
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:54,200
It was like mostly white people.

3275
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:55,760
It was like 80 percent white.

3276
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:56,660
Wow.

3277
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:57,050
You know,

3278
01:28:57,050 --> 01:28:57,883
but it was the,

3279
01:28:57,890 --> 01:28:59,030
it was amazing.

3280
01:28:59,031 --> 01:28:59,570
Really.

3281
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:02,190
I had such great to nicest people

3282
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:03,000
ever.

3283
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,810
Chinese are the nicest
people ever and you know,

3284
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:07,830
you just learn.

3285
01:29:07,831 --> 01:29:09,180
It's like everybody's the same and she,

3286
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:13,800
she got governments and they're
fighting with each other over resources.

3287
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:15,750
The resources problem in China's.

3288
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:16,620
It's really a problem.

3289
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,380
You is a funny thing.

3290
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:22,140
That whole factory thing in China.

3291
01:29:22,141 --> 01:29:22,830
You know when people.

3292
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:25,020
I had a thing on the podcast
were I was trying to figure out,

3293
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:27,210
is there a Karma free cell phone,

3294
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:31,440
his cell phone that I can get where
I don't feel bad about owning it?

3295
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:32,630
Turns out there's not.

3296
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,590
Why do you feel bad about owning it?

3297
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:37,710
I feel bad that someone has to make
fucking fifteen cents an hour to make

3298
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:38,544
something.

3299
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:44,240
They should have an iphone called the
Karma and the icon has made in America and

3300
01:29:45,301 --> 01:29:49,230
they pay the people a real wage and
you're going to cost twice as much.

3301
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,410
It costs twice as much and a lot
of people would folk you do sugar,

3302
01:29:52,411 --> 01:29:52,950
brilliant food.

3303
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:53,341
My phone.

3304
01:29:53,341 --> 01:29:53,820
No,

3305
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:54,850
who are you fucking go to me.

3306
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:55,741
That's not what I'm saying,

3307
01:29:55,741 --> 01:29:55,951
dude,

3308
01:29:55,951 --> 01:29:57,150
I'm not talking about you if you want to.

3309
01:29:57,151 --> 01:29:58,320
I'm not judging you,

3310
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:03,060
but I'm saying it would be nice for me
if I knew that this was made by people

3311
01:30:03,061 --> 01:30:05,010
who were paid for their labor,

3312
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:05,430
you know,

3313
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:10,430
a really fair price so they could afford
to go on vacation so they could afford

3314
01:30:10,861 --> 01:30:12,900
to live in a nice place so
they can afford to have food.

3315
01:30:12,901 --> 01:30:13,500
And you know,

3316
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,270
I think if you fucking work all day,

3317
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:16,920
you should not have issues.

3318
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,060
You should not have issues.

3319
01:30:18,061 --> 01:30:18,350
Like,

3320
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:18,650
uh,

3321
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:19,080
you know,

3322
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:19,801
I'm homeless.

3323
01:30:19,801 --> 01:30:20,011
You know,

3324
01:30:20,011 --> 01:30:20,821
you should not have issues.

3325
01:30:20,821 --> 01:30:21,210
Like,

3326
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:21,421
oh,

3327
01:30:21,421 --> 01:30:22,770
I can't afford health insurance.

3328
01:30:22,771 --> 01:30:23,400
You should not.

3329
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,630
If you're working all day,

3330
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:25,031
your,

3331
01:30:25,031 --> 01:30:25,301
your,

3332
01:30:25,301 --> 01:30:27,310
your day should be worth something.

3333
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:27,481
Well,

3334
01:30:27,481 --> 01:30:30,870
and that's why I think the whole thing
is going to collapse because not just in

3335
01:30:30,871 --> 01:30:31,261
America,

3336
01:30:31,261 --> 01:30:34,740
but around the world because here
you're taking these jobs from here where

3337
01:30:34,741 --> 01:30:38,190
you're paying a living wage and you're
taking over here and you're not paying a

3338
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:39,930
living wage or paying next to nothing.

3339
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:43,020
So the people over here can't buy anything
and now the people over here can't

3340
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:43,710
buy anything.

3341
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:45,330
So who's going to buy the goods?

3342
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:45,511
Well,

3343
01:30:45,511 --> 01:30:46,490
the real question is,

3344
01:30:46,510 --> 01:30:46,960
yeah,

3345
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:47,681
who can buy it,

3346
01:30:47,681 --> 01:30:50,040
but the real question
is how can you compete,

3347
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:53,430
how can you make something in this
chair of support and that's why the

3348
01:30:53,431 --> 01:30:58,431
administration just same three new huge
free trade agreements they say are as

3349
01:30:58,801 --> 01:31:03,060
big as Nafta and they're going around
like job creating bill on that and you

3350
01:31:03,061 --> 01:31:03,870
just sign that,

3351
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:04,830
that free trade thing.

3352
01:31:04,831 --> 01:31:05,491
We're screwed.

3353
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:09,450
Map and stuff like that is where
people really get the motivation.

3354
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:10,290
That's the,

3355
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:10,800
the,

3356
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,800
the inspiration to think that this is a
rigged system to think that this is some

3357
01:31:16,081 --> 01:31:19,050
sort of Illuminati plan to
slowly crashed the economy.

3358
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:20,003
Things like that,

3359
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:20,520
you know,

3360
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,420
free trade agreements.

3361
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:23,310
But I think it's just
a fucking money grab.

3362
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:25,470
It's just greedy corporations,

3363
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,300
corporations and greedy cons.

3364
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:29,010
And the problem is the corporations,

3365
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:33,030
they found out that the Chinese
and all these different industries,

3366
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:37,260
nations all around the world
are willing to work harder,

3367
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:41,280
longer hours for less money and then
thus they can produce shit cheaper.

3368
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,710
And because they found out that it's like,

3369
01:31:43,711 --> 01:31:43,951
they're like,

3370
01:31:43,951 --> 01:31:44,071
well,

3371
01:31:44,071 --> 01:31:47,100
we have to compete if you
want these American jobs,

3372
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:47,610
you know,

3373
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:50,430
our whole business is going to go
under unless you move or at least our

3374
01:31:50,431 --> 01:31:52,380
factories over there.

3375
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:52,840
And then,

3376
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:53,221
okay,

3377
01:31:53,221 --> 01:31:53,520
okay,

3378
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:53,680
okay,

3379
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:56,130
move your factories over there
but sell your Nike's over here,

3380
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:56,940
you know,

3381
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:59,040
you gotta have some Nike
employees over here,

3382
01:31:59,050 --> 01:31:59,230
but,

3383
01:31:59,230 --> 01:31:59,850
you know,

3384
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:00,160
right.

3385
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:00,870
One hundred percent.

3386
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:01,990
And over there it's like,

3387
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:06,100
I guess the stuff's cheap
or to sell in terms of like,

3388
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:06,431
you know,

3389
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:08,860
what Chinese are buying
the same goods as us.

3390
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:12,700
We pay way more because we supposedly
have a higher standard of living.

3391
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,830
But eventually that's going
to have to go down to.

3392
01:32:14,831 --> 01:32:15,161
Right.

3393
01:32:15,161 --> 01:32:18,850
I mean if we're not having those jobs
and we're all working at Walmart making

3394
01:32:18,851 --> 01:32:19,930
like $7 an hour,

3395
01:32:19,931 --> 01:32:21,200
we can't afford to buy a,

3396
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:21,601
a,

3397
01:32:21,601 --> 01:32:21,870
you know,

3398
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,290
$150 phone or something.

3399
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:24,430
You eat any wacky shit.

3400
01:32:24,431 --> 01:32:25,060
When you were in China,

3401
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:26,260
did you any bugs or anything?

3402
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:26,590
No,

3403
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:28,030
they had squirrel on,

3404
01:32:28,031 --> 01:32:28,450
um,

3405
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:29,050
one of,

3406
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:30,070
one of the restaurants.

3407
01:32:30,071 --> 01:32:31,180
I just didn't want to eat it.

3408
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:32,803
Pretty normal here.

3409
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:33,490
What's that?

3410
01:32:33,490 --> 01:32:34,690
Did you sleep with any of them?

3411
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:35,291
Know?

3412
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:37,840
I banged a Israeli chick in China,

3413
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:41,493
in China,

3414
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:42,750
and she was.

3415
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:43,660
Was she doing over there?

3416
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:44,460
She's,

3417
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:45,640
she was trying to start it.

3418
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:49,930
She was working for some company
and she to stablish some kind of a,

3419
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:50,440
you know,

3420
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,580
she had a business over there.

3421
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:52,361
People go over there.

3422
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:54,140
It's like the wild west or moving there.

3423
01:32:54,141 --> 01:32:56,830
They're trying to set up
businesses and you know,

3424
01:32:56,831 --> 01:32:58,030
it's awesome though man.

3425
01:32:58,031 --> 01:33:00,100
But what they did in China,

3426
01:33:00,101 --> 01:33:02,170
someone was saying something
bad ass about that,

3427
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:03,760
but moving to another country,

3428
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:04,590
wes bro.

3429
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:07,270
It's like your reality
just completely shifted.

3430
01:33:07,271 --> 01:33:07,451
You know,

3431
01:33:07,451 --> 01:33:09,400
you move into moving to fucking Hawaii.

3432
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:10,121
It's Kinda crazy,

3433
01:33:10,121 --> 01:33:10,660
you know.

3434
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:11,620
But God damn man,

3435
01:33:11,621 --> 01:33:12,454
moving to China,

3436
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:17,350
I had the best time and
the driving is crazy.

3437
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:20,440
They'll turn anything into a car.

3438
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:21,890
I,

3439
01:33:21,890 --> 01:33:23,050
they're totally racist.

3440
01:33:23,051 --> 01:33:23,561
The Chinese,

3441
01:33:23,561 --> 01:33:24,580
they don't give a shit.

3442
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,810
They're totally racist.

3443
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:26,590
I used to,

3444
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:27,161
when I was there,

3445
01:33:27,161 --> 01:33:28,150
I had a full beard.

3446
01:33:28,890 --> 01:33:29,920
I looked Middle Eastern.

3447
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:32,470
They don't like middle easterns because
they think they're all drug dealers

3448
01:33:32,471 --> 01:33:33,070
there.

3449
01:33:33,070 --> 01:33:34,390
So I couldn't get a car,

3450
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:35,680
sometimes a taxi,

3451
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:39,340
so the only guy that would pick us
up one time was this dude who drew,

3452
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:43,510
drove what looked like they took a hot
dog vending machine and turned it into a

3453
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:47,560
car and it literally had like
the most chunkiest like shift,

3454
01:33:47,561 --> 01:33:49,910
changing device and I'm,

3455
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:53,680
you'll never scream more in your life
like a little girl then when you drive

3456
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:57,910
through China through Beijing or Shanghai
because they don't follow the lights.

3457
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:00,660
I've seen somebody try and
Chinese traffic accidents online.

3458
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:01,900
You don't have to convince me.

3459
01:34:01,901 --> 01:34:03,640
I've seen people get run
over by cars in China.

3460
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:03,970
You.

3461
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:04,151
Oh,

3462
01:34:04,151 --> 01:34:05,200
what about that little girl?

3463
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,433
I couldn't watch it.

3464
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,200
I couldn't watch it.

3465
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:08,970
I couldn't watch it.

3466
01:34:08,970 --> 01:34:10,060
It just makes me sad.

3467
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,350
That's the overpopulation thing,

3468
01:34:11,351 --> 01:34:11,561
man.

3469
01:34:11,561 --> 01:34:11,891
When you had.

3470
01:34:11,891 --> 01:34:15,190
It's just like they've done population
density studies on rats and the same

3471
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:15,840
thing happens.

3472
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,040
You get too many in one place
and they devalue each other.

3473
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:18,761
You know,

3474
01:34:18,761 --> 01:34:19,840
that's what's going on,

3475
01:34:19,841 --> 01:34:19,991
man.

3476
01:34:19,991 --> 01:34:23,590
You can't jam that many fucking human
beings in one spot and expect everybody to

3477
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:25,720
think that everybody is
precious because he's precious.

3478
01:34:25,721 --> 01:34:26,800
Things were my fucking way,

3479
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:27,311
you know,

3480
01:34:27,311 --> 01:34:28,300
so no one cares,

3481
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:28,910
man.

3482
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:29,190
Yeah.

3483
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:29,980
It's just.

3484
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:30,490
Yeah.

3485
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:32,650
I remember reading that in a college man.

3486
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:34,480
They started running in gangs.

3487
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:35,850
They said like one guy was,

3488
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:36,310
you know,

3489
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:36,920
they had.

3490
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:37,120
Yeah,

3491
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,320
it got really shady,

3492
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:39,041
like rats.

3493
01:34:39,041 --> 01:34:40,750
Just mental problems.

3494
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:41,320
Just.

3495
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:41,950
Yeah.

3496
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:42,161
Yeah.

3497
01:34:42,161 --> 01:34:42,401
They,

3498
01:34:42,401 --> 01:34:42,610
uh,

3499
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:43,870
some of them huddled in the corner,

3500
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:44,351
the rats,

3501
01:34:44,351 --> 01:34:47,050
they would huddle huddle in the corner
and just rock themselves back and forth,

3502
01:34:47,051 --> 01:34:47,261
back.

3503
01:34:47,261 --> 01:34:48,220
Just going nuts.

3504
01:34:48,610 --> 01:34:49,510
Now you look at some,

3505
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:51,460
some human behavior and you've got to go,

3506
01:34:51,461 --> 01:34:52,031
God damn.

3507
01:34:52,031 --> 01:34:54,160
How the fuck can we ever prevent this?

3508
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:55,930
What the hell happened here?

3509
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:56,370
What,

3510
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:57,203
what is this?

3511
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,010
You

3512
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,760
know what?

3513
01:34:58,760 --> 01:34:59,510
I was watching this.

3514
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:00,250
I tweeted this,

3515
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:04,820
this video about this woman
who was a pioneer in scat porn.

3516
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:05,750
It's uh,

3517
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:06,440
it's rough.

3518
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,730
And if you read my tweets,

3519
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,660
read it,

3520
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:09,890
but don't click on the link.

3521
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,740
There's a lake nearby choice.

3522
01:35:12,741 --> 01:35:13,161
Yes,

3523
01:35:13,161 --> 01:35:13,431
yes,

3524
01:35:13,431 --> 01:35:14,030
yes.

3525
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:15,800
She's one of the first while she's,

3526
01:35:15,801 --> 01:35:16,220
you know,

3527
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:17,150
she's an expert at it.

3528
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:17,710
She's,

3529
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:18,351
that's what she does,

3530
01:35:18,351 --> 01:35:19,430
but she eats shit.

3531
01:35:19,431 --> 01:35:20,620
She eats it and swallows it.

3532
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:23,990
And she was talking about how she
loves being stuffed with Shit.

3533
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:24,501
Dude,

3534
01:35:24,501 --> 01:35:24,780
it's.

3535
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:26,840
I would love to have her on my podcast.

3536
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,090
Like I want to interview those people.

3537
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:29,990
She's in Germany,

3538
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:30,470
she's.

3539
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:31,400
She speaks German.

3540
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,060
I would love Germany this video.

3541
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:33,560
But Dude,

3542
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,490
she has a website.

3543
01:35:34,491 --> 01:35:35,600
Somebody tweeted the websites,

3544
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:36,410
I retweeted it.

3545
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:37,460
If you see the retweet,

3546
01:35:37,461 --> 01:35:38,294
don't click it.

3547
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:39,163
I'm telling you right now,

3548
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:44,000
don't do it because this woman is just
smeared and shit and these videos and she

3549
01:35:44,001 --> 01:35:45,170
has people shit in her mouth.

3550
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:46,280
And she chose it and swallow it.

3551
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,050
And they asked her how many,

3552
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:50,510
how much shit you think you've
eaten over the course of your life.

3553
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:51,021
She was like,

3554
01:35:51,021 --> 01:35:51,201
oh,

3555
01:35:51,201 --> 01:35:52,640
several bathtubs full.

3556
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:53,860
Well,

3557
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:56,840
what about the guy that used to go
on sterner lake to get thrown up on?

3558
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:57,591
That's nothing,

3559
01:35:57,591 --> 01:35:57,920
dude.

3560
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:58,101
She.

3561
01:35:58,101 --> 01:36:01,040
This bitch has eaten
bathtubs full of human shit.

3562
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:03,730
Someone let's get thrown up on you.

3563
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:06,880
Them Shits were some throw off fucking.

3564
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,960
They're both equally bad.

3565
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:12,680
We watched it way worse than
when we did open anthony.

3566
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,990
We were there for the infamous baby bird.

3567
01:36:14,991 --> 01:36:16,250
It was me and Ari were.

3568
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,710
There you weren't there for baby bird
when the guy threw up the guy's mouth.

3569
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:20,210
This fucking dude,

3570
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:21,870
I forget.

3571
01:36:21,870 --> 01:36:23,270
That's right there bro.

3572
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,350
From Inaki.

3573
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:24,711
No,

3574
01:36:24,711 --> 01:36:25,160
not pat.

3575
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:25,340
Yeah,

3576
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:26,090
pat from when Nike.

3577
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:27,410
But the other Guy Smith.

3578
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:28,700
What the fuck's his name?

3579
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:30,133
Pat Duffy.

3580
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:33,950
Pat Duffy was the other guy who
let them throw up and its mouth.

3581
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:35,211
So this was a,

3582
01:36:35,211 --> 01:36:39,090
there was a eggnog eating contest and I
don't remember how many shots you have.

3583
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:39,960
It was something insane.

3584
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:41,270
He's almost a gallon I think.

3585
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,480
I think the human body can only have
a gallon of milk or two gallons.

3586
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,010
It was like 70 shots
or something like that.

3587
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:48,530
Something insane.

3588
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:49,101
So anyway,

3589
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:49,934
he does that.

3590
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:50,960
And then the,

3591
01:36:50,961 --> 01:36:51,320
uh,

3592
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:53,660
we were trying to figure out what to do
because he knew he was gonna throw up.

3593
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:58,460
And then we suggested that one of the
interns lean his head over the dumpster,

3594
01:36:58,461 --> 01:37:01,910
over the garbage bucket and open his
mouth and let the dude throw up in his

3595
01:37:01,911 --> 01:37:03,470
mouth like a baby bird feed.

3596
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,100
Not that guys.

3597
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:07,100
Now where is he?

3598
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:07,731
Where's that guy?

3599
01:37:07,731 --> 01:37:08,310
Right.

3600
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:09,530
He did a bunch of other shit too.

3601
01:37:09,531 --> 01:37:09,810
He,

3602
01:37:09,810 --> 01:37:10,130
he,

3603
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:11,780
he brushed his teeth with dog shit.

3604
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:13,731
You're all in,

3605
01:37:13,731 --> 01:37:16,010
in that open anthony world at that point.

3606
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:18,260
That's where you're going to be
working and that's where you're going.

3607
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,153
You can't go.

3608
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,810
It's like the girl got shit on.

3609
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:22,880
It's like it's gonna be hard for her.

3610
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:24,980
She didn't choose to get shit on yet,

3611
01:37:24,981 --> 01:37:27,400
but she's still going to be
the girl that got shit on him.

3612
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,030
Is this Pat Duffy guy?

3613
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:30,380
Well that's crazy.

3614
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:31,760
I'm with crazy.

3615
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:32,980
Where do you go if you're pat?

3616
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,430
There's those guys out there,

3617
01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:34,731
man.

3618
01:37:34,731 --> 01:37:37,340
This guys out there that are run to
me and put me on fucking fear factor,

3619
01:37:37,341 --> 01:37:37,521
Bro.

3620
01:37:37,521 --> 01:37:38,230
You anything.

3621
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:38,731
You know there's,

3622
01:37:38,731 --> 01:37:39,950
there's a few of those guys that just,

3623
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:40,821
they're willing to do it.

3624
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:41,060
Look,

3625
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:43,670
jackass guys that are willing
to do anything for the joke,

3626
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:44,410
you know,

3627
01:37:44,410 --> 01:37:47,780
did fucking Johnny Knoxville stood in
front of a bull with a blindfold on?

3628
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:48,620
He really did.

3629
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:49,430
He really did that.

3630
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:50,630
He's a goddamn movie star.

3631
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:50,870
Okay.

3632
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:52,530
He was in a movie with the Rock Sky,

3633
01:37:52,531 --> 01:37:56,100
stood in front of a bull with a
blindfold on and let bowl launch

3634
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:57,060
him through the air like a,

3635
01:37:57,090 --> 01:37:57,930
like a sheet.

3636
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:02,200
Steevo did the last movie completely
sober because I knew back in the day there

3637
01:38:02,201 --> 01:38:05,310
are popping Vic's and just bang
killers so they couldn't feel.

3638
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,440
He did this one completely sober.

3639
01:38:07,441 --> 01:38:08,220
I'm like,

3640
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:10,530
that's some crazy ass shit,

3641
01:38:10,531 --> 01:38:10,950
man.

3642
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:11,490
God,

3643
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:12,330
it's horrible.

3644
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:12,940
Yeah.

3645
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:14,420
Well maybe he broke his nose on the.

3646
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:15,141
The roast.

3647
01:38:15,141 --> 01:38:15,390
Yeah.

3648
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:17,270
He ran into Mike Tyson's fist.

3649
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,450
He's the nicest guy,

3650
01:38:18,451 --> 01:38:18,810
man.

3651
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:19,650
I just feel like.

3652
01:38:19,651 --> 01:38:23,920
I guess that's the thing that
Mike Tyson break his nose.

3653
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:26,280
His whole thing is he does stents.

3654
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:28,350
That's not a stunt dude a stunt.

3655
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:29,460
It's cutting yourself.

3656
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:33,510
Jump a motorcycle and you
land it and everybody cheers.

3657
01:38:33,511 --> 01:38:34,344
That's not a stunt.

3658
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:35,431
That's like saying,

3659
01:38:35,431 --> 01:38:37,170
I'm going to drive my
motorcycle into a wall.

3660
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,520
It's a stunt stunt.

3661
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:39,383
You're crashing.

3662
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:40,430
You're hurting yourself.

3663
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:41,263
I've done that.

3664
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:42,120
You have?

3665
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:42,421
Yeah.

3666
01:38:42,421 --> 01:38:43,400
My spike shell.

3667
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:43,980
That's right.

3668
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:44,190
Oh,

3669
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:45,023
that's right.

3670
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:47,011
That was a fun show,

3671
01:38:47,011 --> 01:38:47,221
right?

3672
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:47,431
It was.

3673
01:38:47,431 --> 01:38:48,690
You kicked cope and Ellis.

3674
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:49,020
Yeah.

3675
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:49,890
Jason Alice.

3676
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:50,903
What did you guys do?

3677
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:51,731
Just did it?

3678
01:38:51,731 --> 01:38:53,250
Average jackass type shit?

3679
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:54,180
Uh,

3680
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:54,900
well yeah.

3681
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:57,990
I mean later on because I
never really watched Jack Ass,

3682
01:38:57,991 --> 01:38:59,700
but later on I watched the show.

3683
01:38:59,701 --> 01:39:00,510
I'm like,

3684
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:00,631
oh,

3685
01:39:00,631 --> 01:39:01,620
they got that from that.

3686
01:39:01,621 --> 01:39:01,981
They Kinda,

3687
01:39:01,981 --> 01:39:03,720
it was Kinda like Taj Point.

3688
01:39:03,721 --> 01:39:03,901
Oh,

3689
01:39:03,901 --> 01:39:04,920
meets Jack Ass.

3690
01:39:04,921 --> 01:39:06,540
That was the premise of the show.

3691
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:07,510
And um,

3692
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:07,951
yeah,

3693
01:39:07,951 --> 01:39:11,400
I did some crazy shit man that
like the worst thing was was uh,

3694
01:39:11,401 --> 01:39:12,870
we had to make a sandwich.

3695
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,040
Why people,

3696
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:18,120
why the other guys were like eight feet
away with paintball guns and we had

3697
01:39:18,121 --> 01:39:23,010
nothing on and we were just getting shot
by paintball guns and I would feel bad

3698
01:39:23,011 --> 01:39:24,750
and I would like do it slowly.

3699
01:39:24,930 --> 01:39:26,700
Those guys didn't give a fuck.

3700
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:27,450
They were vicious,

3701
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:28,290
they were savages,

3702
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:28,501
blah,

3703
01:39:28,501 --> 01:39:28,641
blah,

3704
01:39:28,641 --> 01:39:28,781
blah,

3705
01:39:28,781 --> 01:39:28,920
blah,

3706
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:29,220
blah.

3707
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:30,490
I'm getting nailed it.

3708
01:39:30,850 --> 01:39:32,490
It was the first time I
want to quit the show.

3709
01:39:32,491 --> 01:39:33,030
I was like,

3710
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:33,863
I'm done dude.

3711
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:34,770
Fuck this show.

3712
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:35,693
I never want to do.

3713
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:38,220
I didn't even know were
doing stunts on the show.

3714
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:42,000
I just thought I got hired to talk shit
about videos and that's what I'm good

3715
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:42,121
at.

3716
01:39:42,121 --> 01:39:44,970
I could just tell when did the
stunts become a part of the show?

3717
01:39:45,820 --> 01:39:46,230
Well,

3718
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:48,180
the next day I show up.

3719
01:39:48,181 --> 01:39:48,451
They're like,

3720
01:39:48,451 --> 01:39:48,721

3721
01:39:48,721 --> 01:39:49,441

3722
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:49,740
I'm like,

3723
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:50,041

3724
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:50,431
cool.

3725
01:39:50,431 --> 01:39:51,180
That's great.

3726
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:51,451
Okay.

3727
01:39:51,451 --> 01:39:52,440

3728
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:53,430

3729
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:54,460
here's what you're going to be doing.

3730
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:54,781
I'm like,

3731
01:39:54,781 --> 01:39:55,614

3732
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:56,820
Because I didn't,

3733
01:39:56,850 --> 01:39:57,231
they didn't,

3734
01:39:57,231 --> 01:40:00,810
never mentioned that in the audition
and I got it through going with Steve

3735
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:00,811
Byrne.

3736
01:40:00,811 --> 01:40:01,950
He never mentioned that.

3737
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:03,000
And you can't say no,

3738
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:03,751
but yeah,

3739
01:40:03,751 --> 01:40:05,430
I need to get on television that point,

3740
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:05,971
you know,

3741
01:40:05,971 --> 01:40:07,050
so it's like fuck it.

3742
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:07,651
That's how you felt.

3743
01:40:07,651 --> 01:40:09,120
You felt like you had to say yes,

3744
01:40:09,121 --> 01:40:09,630
right?

3745
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:09,751
I,

3746
01:40:09,751 --> 01:40:10,021
yeah,

3747
01:40:10,021 --> 01:40:10,950
I mean I'm close.

3748
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:12,030
I love spike.

3749
01:40:12,031 --> 01:40:12,470
I was,

3750
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:12,810
you know,

3751
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:13,740
it was cool chiller.

3752
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:14,790
You didn't want to do it right.

3753
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:15,601
You didn't want to do it.

3754
01:40:15,601 --> 01:40:16,700
You didn't think that's
what you're going to do.

3755
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,200
But once you got there like
I need this fucking TV show.

3756
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:20,210
Yep.

3757
01:40:20,210 --> 01:40:21,043
Wow.

3758
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:22,093
Yep.

3759
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:22,540
They,

3760
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:26,790
I was headlining clubs when I got it and
make a big difference if the clubs and

3761
01:40:26,791 --> 01:40:27,624
shit like that.

3762
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:27,981
Yeah,

3763
01:40:27,981 --> 01:40:28,230
I was,

3764
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:29,170
I was headlining clubs.

3765
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:31,050
Did you ever try to do
something else like that again?

3766
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:31,541
Do you ever try it?

3767
01:40:31,541 --> 01:40:33,070
I would never do a show again.

3768
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:33,630
Really?

3769
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:34,110
Yeah.

3770
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:34,801
So when I was canceled,

3771
01:40:34,801 --> 01:40:35,634
you were happy.

3772
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:36,750
Uh,

3773
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:37,650
even though you're off tv,

3774
01:40:37,651 --> 01:40:39,210
you were happy now.

3775
01:40:39,211 --> 01:40:41,310
I wasn't happy so it wouldn't do it again.

3776
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:42,660
They called up again.

3777
01:40:42,850 --> 01:40:44,970
If it continued then I would have done it,

3778
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,010
but I wouldn't do it now
if they call me back.

3779
01:40:47,011 --> 01:40:47,161
Hey,

3780
01:40:47,161 --> 01:40:48,330
we're gonna do another show.

3781
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:49,170
I wouldn't do it.

3782
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:50,610
Have you seen shock fights?

3783
01:40:51,470 --> 01:40:51,810
Uh,

3784
01:40:51,810 --> 01:40:52,800
Jason Analysis?

3785
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:53,190
No.

3786
01:40:53,190 --> 01:40:53,530
No.

3787
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:53,980
This is some

3788
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:54,251
shit.

3789
01:40:54,251 --> 01:40:55,390
I don't know where the fuck is happening.

3790
01:40:55,391 --> 01:40:55,601
I don't know.

3791
01:40:55,601 --> 01:40:56,530
It looks like it's in Cuba.

3792
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,660
I don't know who came up with this,

3793
01:40:58,661 --> 01:41:01,900
but there's these guys in a
ring and they have fucking fist.

3794
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:05,290
They have things on their fists that are
electrocuting each other like tasers on

3795
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:05,980
their knuckles,

3796
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:07,990
but they're punching
each other with tasers.

3797
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,960
That's a guy knocks a guy out
with a fucking taser in his hand.

3798
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:11,670
It's bad ass.

3799
01:41:11,670 --> 01:41:12,503
It's crazy.

3800
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:13,620
They're throwing kicks and

3801
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:15,530
yeah,

3802
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:16,480
he was dog collars.

3803
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:18,980
The crowd just zap them.

3804
01:41:20,770 --> 01:41:22,840
He's willing to do some stuff
that I don't understand,

3805
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:24,670
but this shock fights is like,

3806
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:25,271
man,

3807
01:41:25,271 --> 01:41:25,461
how?

3808
01:41:25,461 --> 01:41:30,400
How far are we from throwing a dude
with a sword into an arena with a lion?

3809
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:31,341
How far away?

3810
01:41:31,341 --> 01:41:34,270
It's not that I'm sure in third world
countries is going to happen sooner than

3811
01:41:34,271 --> 01:41:35,350
you think because there was a.

3812
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:38,890
There was a thing where a guy was
going to have a fucking sword fight.

3813
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:40,030
There was a,

3814
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:42,520
I think it was the guy
going to fight a lion.

3815
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:43,960
It was a Greek guy or something like that.

3816
01:41:43,961 --> 01:41:45,520
I forget what the whole story was,

3817
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:46,301
but I was like,

3818
01:41:46,301 --> 01:41:47,290
I remember this thing,

3819
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:49,470
like it was either a sword fight
or he's going to fight an aunt,

3820
01:41:49,471 --> 01:41:50,860
a wild animal or something like that,

3821
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:51,910
but I remember thinking like,

3822
01:41:51,911 --> 01:41:52,181
okay,

3823
01:41:52,181 --> 01:41:53,470
this is how it starts.

3824
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:57,130
Because it starts where people hear
about on the Internet and then they go,

3825
01:41:57,131 --> 01:41:57,461
oh,

3826
01:41:57,461 --> 01:41:58,120
okay.

3827
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,110
And then somewhere,

3828
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:00,070
wherever the fuck it is,

3829
01:42:00,071 --> 01:42:01,330
where life's not that expensive.

3830
01:42:01,331 --> 01:42:02,164
High Tiawana.

3831
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:03,490
Somewhere along those lines,

3832
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:05,470
they set up an arena and they just say,

3833
01:42:05,471 --> 01:42:05,651
well,

3834
01:42:05,651 --> 01:42:06,580
instead of both sides,

3835
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:09,960
now we're going to have people wearing
armor and they're gonna fight lions and

3836
01:42:09,961 --> 01:42:11,500
I'm rooting for the line every time.

3837
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:12,400
Wow.

3838
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,800
Maybe how do you not?

3839
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,500
Maybe the guy has children who can't
feed and he's fucking willing to get in

3840
01:42:17,501 --> 01:42:18,281
there with a lot of line.

3841
01:42:18,281 --> 01:42:19,240
Has No choice.

3842
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:19,660
Yeah,

3843
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:20,500
and being sure.

3844
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:21,460
I mean the guy has a choice,

3845
01:42:21,461 --> 01:42:22,660
but I still root for the person.

3846
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,130
I'm reminded lying people.

3847
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:25,640
I'm on team lying,

3848
01:42:25,641 --> 01:42:26,240
Bro.

3849
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:26,861
I have to,

3850
01:42:26,861 --> 01:42:27,310
man.

3851
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:29,620
I just like the lines
aren't choosing to be there.

3852
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:30,131
He's not,

3853
01:42:30,131 --> 01:42:31,210
but he's going to kill the person.

3854
01:42:31,211 --> 01:42:33,190
It's not like the person that was
any different than the killer.

3855
01:42:33,191 --> 01:42:34,024
Well,

3856
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:35,430
that's are dumb.

3857
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:36,850
Lions aren't smart.

3858
01:42:37,390 --> 01:42:38,860
It's not that much different,

3859
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,320
but lions are not that.

3860
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:40,540
You know,

3861
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:43,720
lions are just fucking there
to remove mental capacity,

3862
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:45,430
whether it's going to be a crime or not.

3863
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:46,293
Not only that,

3864
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:48,820
I feel like lions are part of our domain,

3865
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:49,930
whereas killer whales,

3866
01:42:49,931 --> 01:42:53,410
we have to go into their world and
pull them out of their world and cap.

3867
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:56,800
They don't interact with us on a regular
basis unless we get on boats and enter

3868
01:42:56,801 --> 01:42:57,634
into their world.

3869
01:42:57,730 --> 01:42:58,301
Lions.

3870
01:42:58,301 --> 01:42:59,134
On the other hand,

3871
01:42:59,140 --> 01:42:59,681
they want.

3872
01:42:59,681 --> 01:43:01,340
You mean you're in Africa like they.

3873
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:03,970
A friend of mine was in
Africa and while he was there,

3874
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:05,950
some guy got killed where they.

3875
01:43:05,951 --> 01:43:07,750
It came into the camp.

3876
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:09,070
It came into the camp.

3877
01:43:09,071 --> 01:43:12,910
The lion came into the camp while the
dude was in the fucking shower and dragged

3878
01:43:12,911 --> 01:43:14,980
him out of the shower to female lions.

3879
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:19,420
Lions can suck my Dick.

3880
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:19,810
Okay.

3881
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:21,160
Lions can go fuck themselves.

3882
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:22,000
It's a killer whale.

3883
01:43:22,001 --> 01:43:22,510
Like guys,

3884
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:22,940
surfing,

3885
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:24,360
kill comes up and whoop some ass.

3886
01:43:24,361 --> 01:43:24,731
I don't.

3887
01:43:24,731 --> 01:43:25,150
They don't.

3888
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:25,983
They don't know.

3889
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:27,140
No one's been killed by Carol.

3890
01:43:27,141 --> 01:43:27,301
Well,

3891
01:43:27,301 --> 01:43:28,030
not only that,

3892
01:43:28,030 --> 01:43:28,511
not only that,

3893
01:43:28,511 --> 01:43:29,344
they help people.

3894
01:43:30,490 --> 01:43:32,800
They've actually saved people when
they've learned they're drowning.

3895
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:34,180
Killer whales aren't sharks.

3896
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:35,051
The sharks.

3897
01:43:35,051 --> 01:43:35,770
I could see your point.

3898
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:36,760
Sharks can suck my dick.

3899
01:43:36,761 --> 01:43:38,590
You can take a shark and throw
in a fish tank all day long.

3900
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:39,660
I don't have a feeling for a sharp,

3901
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:43,360
but killer whales are
superintelligent safe people.

3902
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:45,390
But I think that when you're,

3903
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:45,730
you know,

3904
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:46,240
I don't,

3905
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:48,490
I'm not saying you should have
Christians versus the lions.

3906
01:43:48,491 --> 01:43:51,240
I'm not saying you should pick an arm
dudes and send them in and you know,

3907
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:51,980
have a sword fight

3908
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:52,610
with the lions.

3909
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:53,990
But I am saying if it goes down,

3910
01:43:53,991 --> 01:43:55,220
I'm rooting for the fucking person.

3911
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:56,690
I think I want to know,

3912
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:58,280
can you kill a lion with a sword?

3913
01:43:58,610 --> 01:44:01,790
Can you be armored up and kill a
fucking line with nothing but a sword?

3914
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:02,720
If that guy can do it,

3915
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:03,261
good for him,

3916
01:44:03,261 --> 01:44:03,650
man.

3917
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:05,120
I just might not be able to.

3918
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:06,420
You might not be able to line.

3919
01:44:06,430 --> 01:44:07,700
Might just Jack you every time.

3920
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:10,460
It's like you want to dudes from
death row fighting to the death.

3921
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:11,390
I'm fine with that.

3922
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:13,700
Really just fighting it an animal.

3923
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,260
I just don't,

3924
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:15,651
you know,

3925
01:44:15,651 --> 01:44:16,380
it's like I get,

3926
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:17,030
I get.

3927
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:18,200
I don't think you should do it.

3928
01:44:18,730 --> 01:44:19,150
Yeah.

3929
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:19,983
If you do do it,

3930
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,660
I'm rooting for the person and then I
will put 20 bucks and I'm always going for

3931
01:44:23,661 --> 01:44:24,090
the lie.

3932
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:24,810
Really?

3933
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:25,643
I'm always.

3934
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:27,480
Was that Brian?

3935
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:27,830
Same.

3936
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:28,790
Same exact reasons.

3937
01:44:29,470 --> 01:44:32,780
But what if you found out the guy was
like super poor and you have the Guy

3938
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:33,050
Brian?

3939
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:33,321
No,

3940
01:44:33,321 --> 01:44:34,190
I just no sleep.

3941
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:35,690
Why is it black?

3942
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:38,700
It looks under the thing like you
just got rocked and your eyeball.

3943
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:39,490
That's the.

3944
01:44:39,490 --> 01:44:40,790
It's coming out of his eyeballs.

3945
01:44:42,730 --> 01:44:43,260
He had fun.

3946
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:45,410
While I agree with Sam on that,

3947
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:46,130
I think.

3948
01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:48,680
I think even if they showed
me the story of this poor,

3949
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:49,514
sad guy,

3950
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:52,770
he has a choice to chose the
choice to fucking line on it,

3951
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:56,090
but I'm rooting for him and we might
not interfere with whales because we

3952
01:44:56,091 --> 01:44:56,960
haven't moved there yet.

3953
01:44:56,961 --> 01:44:57,890
But if you went,

3954
01:44:57,891 --> 01:44:58,190
came,

3955
01:44:58,190 --> 01:45:00,500
went back thousands
and thousands of years.

3956
01:45:00,501 --> 01:45:02,420
We're in lion territory right now,

3957
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:02,821
you know,

3958
01:45:02,821 --> 01:45:04,610
so I'm sort of.

3959
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:06,080
I mean there was some
sort of big cats here.

3960
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:07,210
Saber Tooth Tigers I think.

3961
01:45:07,490 --> 01:45:07,641
Yeah,

3962
01:45:07,641 --> 01:45:08,580
I think there was lions.

3963
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:09,381
Well actually there was,

3964
01:45:09,381 --> 01:45:11,960
there was a North American
line a long fucking time ago.

3965
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:15,470
So a different commands welcome
through the jungle and a lion comes.

3966
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:16,370
I'm rooting for the guy.

3967
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:17,120
Okay,

3968
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:18,020
I'm rooting for the guy.

3969
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:19,400
But when you grabbed the lion,

3970
01:45:19,401 --> 01:45:24,401
you have very specific rules in line to
be there with no choice where it's not

3971
01:45:24,831 --> 01:45:27,460
naturally going to be there and
it could die because you're.

3972
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:28,440
You're trying to make 20.

3973
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:29,140
It's like,

3974
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:31,790
it's like why people didn't
like the dog fighting.

3975
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:33,890
Especially when you have a dog.

3976
01:45:33,891 --> 01:45:34,071
You're like,

3977
01:45:34,071 --> 01:45:34,904
I said,

3978
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:35,181
dude,

3979
01:45:35,181 --> 01:45:36,050
I'm not saying you should do it,

3980
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,130
but I'm saying if you do do it,

3981
01:45:37,131 --> 01:45:37,880
I'm going to root for you.

3982
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:38,590
I'll smack it.

3983
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:39,370
Animal though.

3984
01:45:39,370 --> 01:45:40,280
I'd not heard it though.

3985
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:42,740
Just you've got discipline your dog.

3986
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:43,933
We slept at him.

3987
01:45:44,270 --> 01:45:47,180
See the woman who heads
it like a hippo for a pet.

3988
01:45:47,270 --> 01:45:48,103
Oh my God.

3989
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:49,520
I read some article on it.

3990
01:45:49,521 --> 01:45:50,690
She has a hippo for pack.

3991
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:52,130
It's going to come and get ya.

3992
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:53,500
It's eventually going to turn on you.

3993
01:45:53,501 --> 01:45:54,334
Is it a male?

3994
01:45:54,670 --> 01:45:54,961
I didn't.

3995
01:45:54,961 --> 01:45:55,794
I didn't read it.

3996
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:57,500
Whether it was a male or a female.

3997
01:45:57,501 --> 01:45:58,940
She can keep it together
for a little while.

3998
01:45:59,450 --> 01:45:59,961
If it's a male,

3999
01:45:59,961 --> 01:46:01,280
it's going to be biting people in half.

4000
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:03,290
They bite crocodiles and half to 100.

4001
01:46:03,730 --> 01:46:05,900
I'm 100 percent.

4002
01:46:07,930 --> 01:46:09,280
Was is 100 percent.

4003
01:46:09,281 --> 01:46:09,430
No,

4004
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:09,940
no man.

4005
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:11,060
I'm just agreeing with you.

4006
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:12,320
What'd you get on your testing?

4007
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:14,120
Me One hundred percent.

4008
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:15,170
You a plus student?

4009
01:46:15,370 --> 01:46:16,050
No.

4010
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:17,520
From this weekend you're in La Hoya.

4011
01:46:17,521 --> 01:46:20,630
If people want to go see you at the comedy
store when you work with down there.

4012
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:22,280
I'm working with uh,

4013
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:23,240
Steve Simone.

4014
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:24,710
Beautiful.

4015
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:25,071
Yeah.

4016
01:46:25,071 --> 01:46:26,270
And Tony Hinchcliffe.

4017
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:29,270
They just had a couple gigs fall out.

4018
01:46:29,271 --> 01:46:30,200
I was supposed to be in sale,

4019
01:46:30,201 --> 01:46:32,060
but then I'm going to be December first.

4020
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:34,250
We're going to have the naughty
show at the comedy store.

4021
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:35,240
Powerful change.

4022
01:46:35,241 --> 01:46:37,070
Joe Rogan should make a return.

4023
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:37,521
Can't go.

4024
01:46:37,521 --> 01:46:38,030
Sorry.

4025
01:46:38,030 --> 01:46:38,970
We can do it.

4026
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:39,381
Good luck.

4027
01:46:39,381 --> 01:46:40,280
And Satan's asshole.

4028
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:41,611
Yeah,

4029
01:46:41,611 --> 01:46:42,201
I could do it,

4030
01:46:42,201 --> 01:46:43,034
but I'm not going to.

4031
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:43,460
Good luck.

4032
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:44,293
Are you one?

4033
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:46,130
I don't ever need to go back to that.

4034
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:47,030
You don't.

4035
01:46:47,030 --> 01:46:48,500
There's no win contests.

4036
01:46:48,530 --> 01:46:50,130
You know what one is

4037
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,510
the art form of comedy one,

4038
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:56,100
but the comedy store absolutely fucking
picked the wrong side so they can go

4039
01:46:56,101 --> 01:46:56,934
fuck themselves.

4040
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:58,043
Fucked up,

4041
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,330
I like the laugh factory.

4042
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:02,370
I just that places you have
a problem with that place.

4043
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:02,580
Oh,

4044
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,740
100 percent doing naughty comedy now.

4045
01:47:04,820 --> 01:47:06,090
Then the Improv is awesome.

4046
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:06,983
I love the

4047
01:47:08,210 --> 01:47:08,490
job.

4048
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:10,050
I felt it was better for my act anyway.

4049
01:47:10,350 --> 01:47:13,530
I feel like the comedy store is so dark
and angry that I think a lot of that

4050
01:47:13,531 --> 01:47:14,011
shaped.

4051
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:15,390
My material's changed.

4052
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:16,320
Braille hasn't really.

4053
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:17,700
And I don't mean that to be like,

4054
01:47:17,701 --> 01:47:18,210
it's different.

4055
01:47:18,210 --> 01:47:20,340
It's not like you leaving.

4056
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,200
Was it changed really?

4057
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:22,770
Yeah.

4058
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:25,640
Now it's much like pricing.

4059
01:47:25,970 --> 01:47:26,803
Yeah.

4060
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:29,040
I mean like it's not the
same as it used to be.

4061
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:29,670
What was it like?

4062
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:30,540
What's the difference?

4063
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:31,643
It's a,

4064
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:34,640
I think it's like the acts aren't,

4065
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,191
you know,

4066
01:47:35,191 --> 01:47:36,030
I used to watch,

4067
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:36,670
you know,

4068
01:47:36,670 --> 01:47:38,010
monsters onstage,

4069
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:39,120
just guys who are like,

4070
01:47:39,121 --> 01:47:40,200
fuck man,

4071
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,150
I don't see that as much anymore.

4072
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:43,770
It's not what it used to be.

4073
01:47:43,771 --> 01:47:45,690
There's a couple of young
guys I think are bringing it,

4074
01:47:45,691 --> 01:47:46,524
but it's not,

4075
01:47:46,890 --> 01:47:47,170
you know,

4076
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:47,701
it's like,

4077
01:47:47,701 --> 01:47:49,440
it's now a TV credit land.

4078
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:51,270
How did that,

4079
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:52,260
how did it make that change?

4080
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:54,123
Um,

4081
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:56,281
I don't know,

4082
01:47:56,281 --> 01:47:57,020
man.

4083
01:47:57,020 --> 01:48:00,340
I think it's weird how they use the
same people over and over again.

4084
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:02,423
Yeah.

4085
01:48:02,770 --> 01:48:03,630
But now they have.

4086
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:06,840
They've definitely opened the door but
just seems like I've gotten there on some

4087
01:48:06,841 --> 01:48:11,190
nights where these people are in the
main room at 8:00 on like a Wednesday or

4088
01:48:11,191 --> 01:48:12,024
Thursday or whatever.

4089
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:14,010
And I'm saying this person sucks so bad.

4090
01:48:14,011 --> 01:48:15,450
He shouldn't even be in the belly room.

4091
01:48:15,530 --> 01:48:17,010
And he's in the main stage.

4092
01:48:17,011 --> 01:48:17,520
Really.

4093
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,130
The problem is that what,

4094
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:22,020
what made that place great
and it was never perfect,

4095
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:27,050
but what made it great was that you could
be somebody who was an unknown and you

4096
01:48:27,211 --> 01:48:30,180
could get up on stage there
and start honing your craft.

4097
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:31,530
Those days are done.

4098
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:32,101
You know,

4099
01:48:32,101 --> 01:48:34,110
there's certain things
going on there were like,

4100
01:48:34,111 --> 01:48:36,060
apparently if you're on Chelsea lately,

4101
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:36,721
you know,

4102
01:48:36,721 --> 01:48:40,170
that's a sign that you've arrived and
you see like a lot of people who do that

4103
01:48:40,171 --> 01:48:44,850
panel now in the lineup and that's a
great show and she's done great for like

4104
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:46,410
blowing up some of my friends,

4105
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:50,370
but that doesn't necessarily mean you're
going to crush in that our which has

4106
01:48:50,371 --> 01:48:51,204
its own Voodoo.

4107
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:51,960
You know,

4108
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:55,020
so nothing wrong with putting
people that are coming up,

4109
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:58,830
but you got to put them in between some
really good talent and the problem is

4110
01:48:58,831 --> 01:49:01,380
they have some talent that really
doesn't work anywhere else.

4111
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:04,770
They have some people there
that can't get spots anywhere,

4112
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:08,490
but they're grandfathered in somehow and
they've got jokes that are literally 30

4113
01:49:08,491 --> 01:49:09,324
years old.

4114
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:10,260
I mean there's some,

4115
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:12,960
there's some people that tell some jokes
and you haven't seen them in a decade

4116
01:49:12,961 --> 01:49:15,840
and then they'll go through the act
the same fucking way and you know,

4117
01:49:15,841 --> 01:49:17,130
they don't get that many spots,

4118
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:17,431
you know,

4119
01:49:17,431 --> 01:49:20,010
because there's a gang of them so
they don't put them up every week,

4120
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:22,680
but they'll put them up like every two
weeks or every three or four weeks.

4121
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:24,420
And you would sit there
and you'd see them at.

4122
01:49:24,421 --> 01:49:28,410
Some of them would be like bitter and
shit and I'm thinking there's something

4123
01:49:28,411 --> 01:49:31,320
wrong with these young kids
and they suck and you know,

4124
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:33,150
our generation was better and you're like,

4125
01:49:33,210 --> 01:49:33,631
God,

4126
01:49:33,631 --> 01:49:34,464
you're an Indian.

4127
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,120
You're not even really a fucking comedian.

4128
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:37,290
Do you understand this?

4129
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:37,711
Yeah,

4130
01:49:37,711 --> 01:49:38,580
I do see that.

4131
01:49:38,581 --> 01:49:39,480
I see that lot.

4132
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:41,280
I said we're to like the other waitresses.

4133
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:42,330
It used to be waitresses,

4134
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:42,491
uh,

4135
01:49:42,491 --> 01:49:42,810
you know,

4136
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:43,560
only girls,

4137
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:44,010
waitresses.

4138
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:45,630
Now there's girls and guys.

4139
01:49:45,650 --> 01:49:46,620
It's just like the whole,

4140
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:47,980
the whole thing is just the

4141
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,920
waitresses are hot to the
gay guys and gay guy and two,

4142
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:51,900
they want some candy too,

4143
01:49:51,930 --> 01:49:52,550
Bro.

4144
01:49:52,550 --> 01:49:53,560
Gay Guys Want Candy.

4145
01:49:53,561 --> 01:49:56,050
That's what you guys have waiters.

4146
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,340
While you can look at the waitress.

4147
01:49:57,341 --> 01:49:58,240
Do you have to fuck them all?

4148
01:49:58,241 --> 01:49:58,691
Brian?

4149
01:49:58,691 --> 01:49:59,524
Yes.

4150
01:49:59,590 --> 01:49:59,861
Brian,

4151
01:49:59,861 --> 01:50:01,570
have you tried to fuck
any of the waitresses?

4152
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:02,350
Not yet.

4153
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:03,520
Brian is in a committed relationship.

4154
01:50:03,521 --> 01:50:04,321
SORTA kinda right now.

4155
01:50:04,321 --> 01:50:05,300
How's that going?

4156
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:08,170
Is it all working out?

4157
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:11,020
Stinky feet.

4158
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:12,400
She's a very nice girl.

4159
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:18,890
I have not even been home in two days
because you're setting up that place for

4160
01:50:19,121 --> 01:50:20,230
the last three days straight.

4161
01:50:20,610 --> 01:50:20,980
Well,

4162
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:22,450
why don't you come and crash your pad.

4163
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:23,590
I crashed out in the studio.

4164
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:25,340
You come over for like,

4165
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:29,350
I took naps there for like an hour or
two now I'd wake up and there's Jake

4166
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:30,010
Nicole back door.

4167
01:50:30,010 --> 01:50:32,460
You Jagan colback Jordan.

4168
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:37,500
You trying to steal your chick and Sam
Tripoli is so deep deep in the world of

4169
01:50:37,691 --> 01:50:38,430
porn.

4170
01:50:38,430 --> 01:50:39,280
I'm not really,

4171
01:50:39,330 --> 01:50:40,540
if you say the full name,

4172
01:50:40,541 --> 01:50:42,460
I guess if everybody
knows that he knows her,

4173
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:43,121
he knows,

4174
01:50:43,121 --> 01:50:44,560
but there's 500,000 people that don't,

4175
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:45,121
but you,

4176
01:50:45,121 --> 01:50:46,620
you're so deep into the winter.

4177
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:47,890
Love Jadah with it.

4178
01:50:48,170 --> 01:50:49,003
Just go with it.

4179
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:49,863
That's true.

4180
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:50,891
Who knows?

4181
01:50:50,891 --> 01:50:51,820
More porn stars and you,

4182
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:52,601
you're in that world.

4183
01:50:52,601 --> 01:50:55,090
People think I'm going
to pop the porn whisper.

4184
01:50:55,091 --> 01:50:55,924
I'm really not.

4185
01:50:56,590 --> 01:50:58,600
I'm not really like know a lot of the man.

4186
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,490
You get them to come on your
naughty shows all the time,

4187
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:02,260
but he's never seen the show.

4188
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:03,303
What's the website?

4189
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:04,151
Well,

4190
01:51:04,151 --> 01:51:04,901
it's coming back up.

4191
01:51:04,901 --> 01:51:06,040
It's been redesigned right now,

4192
01:51:06,041 --> 01:51:10,600
but to naughty comedy show.com and best
way to get ahold of use what Sam triply

4193
01:51:10,601 --> 01:51:11,230
on twitter,

4194
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:11,560
twitter,

4195
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:11,951
twitter,

4196
01:51:11,951 --> 01:51:14,590
Sam aaa on facebook or my email.

4197
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:14,981
But you're,

4198
01:51:14,981 --> 01:51:15,280
uh,

4199
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:15,650
those,

4200
01:51:15,650 --> 01:51:16,570
those are fucking,

4201
01:51:16,630 --> 01:51:17,560
those are fun shows.

4202
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:21,340
He's got these naughty shows or just he's
got a bunch of really good comedians,

4203
01:51:21,341 --> 01:51:23,710
but he's also got video
clips and they do games.

4204
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:26,590
They fuck around with the audience
and they always have porn stars who do

4205
01:51:26,591 --> 01:51:27,220
things.

4206
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:27,791
I don't know what they do.

4207
01:51:27,791 --> 01:51:31,200
They do their appearances and
they show up and you know what,

4208
01:51:31,201 --> 01:51:31,690
they're people.

4209
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:32,231
You know what man,

4210
01:51:32,231 --> 01:51:35,440
I know it sounds crazy and
like they are who they are,

4211
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:39,030
but at the end of the day they're really
not that different than comedians and

4212
01:51:39,031 --> 01:51:41,440
if you really sat down and you had
a conference that you'd be like,

4213
01:51:41,441 --> 01:51:42,010
wow,

4214
01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:43,840
that's exactly what comedians do.

4215
01:51:44,050 --> 01:51:48,600
They just have something that's kind of
more taboo in society thing guys and you

4216
01:51:48,610 --> 01:51:49,090
know,

4217
01:51:49,090 --> 01:51:51,160
most of them are just
straight business people.

4218
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,170
They're like,

4219
01:51:52,170 --> 01:51:54,070
well that's sort of how
they justified doing it too.

4220
01:51:54,071 --> 01:51:57,220
They sort of go into this business
mode and that always weirds me out.

4221
01:51:57,221 --> 01:51:58,660
Like there's two types of porn stars.

4222
01:51:58,870 --> 01:51:59,411
There's like the,

4223
01:51:59,411 --> 01:51:59,840
the,

4224
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:00,310
the,

4225
01:52:00,310 --> 01:52:01,260
the flight.

4226
01:52:01,261 --> 01:52:03,610
It doesn't know any better.

4227
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:04,900
Super Hot Pornstar.

4228
01:52:04,901 --> 01:52:09,160
It just gets worse because she saw and
then there's a super ambitious career

4229
01:52:09,161 --> 01:52:10,230
woman porn star.

4230
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:10,901
Yeah.

4231
01:52:10,901 --> 01:52:11,720
Those,

4232
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:12,553
those kind of.

4233
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:14,850
Those kind of get me in a weird way like,

4234
01:52:14,940 --> 01:52:15,221
wow,

4235
01:52:15,221 --> 01:52:16,480
this is a strange,

4236
01:52:16,481 --> 01:52:18,280
a strange animal.

4237
01:52:18,281 --> 01:52:23,050
Like this person is working hard to
create all this porn and the real focus.

4238
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:27,280
If you can blow up and you
think podcasting is saturated,

4239
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:28,920
porn is saturated.

4240
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:29,950
There's A.

4241
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:30,670
Everybody's a porn star.

4242
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:31,780
Nobody's making money in it.

4243
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:32,900
How many porn stars are there?

4244
01:52:33,730 --> 01:52:34,630
I mean there's more.

4245
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:36,070
Probably at a seven now.

4246
01:52:36,071 --> 01:52:36,904
I think

4247
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,390
porn stars in Comedians in La.

4248
01:52:40,391 --> 01:52:40,840
I would.

4249
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:41,673
I wouldn't doubt it.

4250
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:43,750
Just the camping thing alone.

4251
01:52:43,751 --> 01:52:45,510
When you find out that
like check this out.

4252
01:52:45,511 --> 01:52:45,980
I don't know if you knew

4253
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:46,191
this.

4254
01:52:46,191 --> 01:52:46,611
If you're.

4255
01:52:46,611 --> 01:52:49,190
If you're 18 years old and you need money,

4256
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:49,540
you.

4257
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:52,160
There is a way to block the
whole state you live in,

4258
01:52:52,161 --> 01:52:53,810
so like say like if
you live in California,

4259
01:52:53,811 --> 01:52:58,700
you block California and you can block
certain cities and then you can cam where

4260
01:52:58,701 --> 01:53:00,500
you can make like fucking whatever,

4261
01:53:00,501 --> 01:53:01,670
$5 a minute,

4262
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:05,840
$10 a minute and you have these things
where you have like 20 people in the same

4263
01:53:05,841 --> 01:53:09,470
room and they're all chipping in more
and more for you to stay in these rooms

4264
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:13,340
and these girls are making thousands a
night from just sitting on their fucking

4265
01:53:13,341 --> 01:53:15,860
ass masturbating and doing nothing.

4266
01:53:15,861 --> 01:53:16,694
But that's.

4267
01:53:16,770 --> 01:53:21,770
It's like it's basically sits
taking advantage of the whole,

4268
01:53:21,901 --> 01:53:24,840
like primal caveman girl,

4269
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:26,490
female relationship.

4270
01:53:26,491 --> 01:53:30,180
It's like when you go to a strip
club and the stripper makes icon,

4271
01:53:30,210 --> 01:53:34,650
she does all the stuff that if you're
at a normal club that lets the girl know

4272
01:53:34,651 --> 01:53:36,710
that she's interested in
you so you make moves,

4273
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:37,920
so they do all that.

4274
01:53:37,950 --> 01:53:41,460
They trick you and all that Shit and
all they want you to do is by lap dances

4275
01:53:41,461 --> 01:53:41,731
from.

4276
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:41,801
Oh,

4277
01:53:41,801 --> 01:53:42,511
that's the weirdest thing.

4278
01:53:42,511 --> 01:53:46,860
Most strip clubs with the roles are
reversed and we men who've never been or

4279
01:53:46,861 --> 01:53:47,730
don't usually go,

4280
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:48,810
they don't know how to deal with it.

4281
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:51,450
You get there and all of a sudden the
women are pursuing you and are super

4282
01:53:51,451 --> 01:53:52,220
aggressive about it.

4283
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:52,381
Like,

4284
01:53:52,381 --> 01:53:52,981
well you want to.

4285
01:53:52,981 --> 01:53:53,940
Well you want to dance.

4286
01:53:54,150 --> 01:53:57,600
So for a lot of guys they just melt and
like fall into it and next thing you

4287
01:53:57,601 --> 01:54:00,930
know that broke because the whole dynamic
has just been shifted and they don't

4288
01:54:00,931 --> 01:54:01,770
understand like they're,

4289
01:54:01,890 --> 01:54:02,430
they're not.

4290
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:04,170
They haven't built up a resistance for it.

4291
01:54:04,171 --> 01:54:08,220
They don't have the immune system for
a strip club social immune system.

4292
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,680
That's the whole thing about
the naughty show is just like,

4293
01:54:10,681 --> 01:54:12,850
I like to explore that
side of the world now.

4294
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:14,700
It's not just sexual either.

4295
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:15,331
It just like.

4296
01:54:15,331 --> 01:54:20,030
I like the crazier side of life and just
like what makes everybody different and

4297
01:54:20,031 --> 01:54:21,210
stuff that everybody wants,

4298
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,430
that everybody does in the shadows.

4299
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:25,260
It's like a lot of people are doing it.

4300
01:54:25,261 --> 01:54:28,770
Why is they one talking about it and not
that I don't like sex out in the open.

4301
01:54:28,771 --> 01:54:33,540
I mean meaning like I don't think porn
star should be like Oscar award winners.

4302
01:54:33,541 --> 01:54:33,930
I don't.

4303
01:54:33,930 --> 01:54:34,531
I don't think.

4304
01:54:34,531 --> 01:54:36,270
I think everybody has their place,

4305
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:38,850
but I don't think it's something you
should have to be ashamed of where like

4306
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:42,270
some find something out about you
and now you're like the town like,

4307
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:42,571
well,

4308
01:54:42,571 --> 01:54:44,340
you're just so used to it to most men,

4309
01:54:44,341 --> 01:54:47,940
the last thing they want is evidence
that the woman has fucks some other dude,

4310
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:49,040
not just fucks some other dude,

4311
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:51,390
but he went asked to mouth on
her and shot a load up her nose.

4312
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:51,501
Oh,

4313
01:54:51,501 --> 01:54:51,990
well that's a whole.

4314
01:54:51,990 --> 01:54:53,520
That's a whole different thing.

4315
01:54:53,521 --> 01:54:54,354
You're talking about

4316
01:54:55,770 --> 01:54:58,350
guys who date porn stars.

4317
01:54:58,390 --> 01:54:59,580
I'm just saying that you know,

4318
01:54:59,581 --> 01:55:02,430
you don't judge them if you don't judge
them or if you met a girl and then she

4319
01:55:02,431 --> 01:55:04,190
wanted a day and then you found
out that she was a porn star.

4320
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:04,411
Fuck,

4321
01:55:04,411 --> 01:55:05,244
hey judge.

4322
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,260
Well if that's not what you're into.

4323
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:07,670
Again,

4324
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:08,401
if you're not into it,

4325
01:55:08,401 --> 01:55:08,671
you're like,

4326
01:55:08,671 --> 01:55:08,911
fuck.

4327
01:55:08,911 --> 01:55:09,001
Yeah,

4328
01:55:09,001 --> 01:55:09,781
but that's nothing.

4329
01:55:09,781 --> 01:55:10,290
You could do it.

4330
01:55:10,290 --> 01:55:12,010
Could you date a porn star?

4331
01:55:12,011 --> 01:55:13,260
It depends on the porn star.

4332
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:14,340
Then what she did.

4333
01:55:14,370 --> 01:55:15,840
So stupid hot.

4334
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:17,360
Depends on what you do.

4335
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:18,930
She came home smelling like loads.

4336
01:55:19,650 --> 01:55:20,640
Then I couldn't do that,

4337
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:21,901
but you know,

4338
01:55:21,901 --> 01:55:25,290
he dated a girl who does lesbian
porn and like lesbos stuff's okay.

4339
01:55:25,291 --> 01:55:25,980
Right.

4340
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:27,330
Which is a weird thing,

4341
01:55:27,510 --> 01:55:28,950
but I can also see where like,

4342
01:55:28,951 --> 01:55:29,191
you know,

4343
01:55:29,191 --> 01:55:30,960
some like aiden who is married to Bella,

4344
01:55:30,961 --> 01:55:31,794
Donna,

4345
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:33,700
he's cooled watching her just get.

4346
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:35,070
I don't think she doesn't anymore,

4347
01:55:35,071 --> 01:55:37,290
but she just getting my brother

4348
01:55:37,350 --> 01:55:37,561
cool.

4349
01:55:37,561 --> 01:55:40,110
I think even the guys that
say it's not cool is still.

4350
01:55:40,610 --> 01:55:42,150
I think there's guys who are into that.

4351
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:42,921
It is cool.

4352
01:55:42,921 --> 01:55:43,754
It's not cool

4353
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,020
guys that are into.

4354
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,560
I'm not saying everybody's into it.

4355
01:55:46,561 --> 01:55:49,390
I think people evolved,

4356
01:55:49,410 --> 01:55:49,920
man,

4357
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:52,740
and sometimes they just
look what guys go to prison.

4358
01:55:52,741 --> 01:55:54,720
They all of a sudden develop
a desire to fuck man.

4359
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:55,501
You know why?

4360
01:55:55,501 --> 01:55:56,310
Because they evolve,

4361
01:55:56,310 --> 01:55:57,450
they adapt,

4362
01:55:57,570 --> 01:56:01,020
they adapt to the situation and if the
only way you can get a check like Bella,

4363
01:56:01,021 --> 01:56:03,000
Donna is to lead black
guy's coming her ass.

4364
01:56:03,450 --> 01:56:03,781
You Go,

4365
01:56:03,781 --> 01:56:04,614
all right,

4366
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:05,603
let's do this.

4367
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:07,650
But that's from your perspective.

4368
01:56:07,651 --> 01:56:08,510
I totally understand.

4369
01:56:08,630 --> 01:56:10,730
But he may be into.

4370
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:11,530
I'm just saying,

4371
01:56:11,530 --> 01:56:12,660
could be yes,

4372
01:56:12,690 --> 01:56:13,471
but could be.

4373
01:56:13,471 --> 01:56:16,140
That's the only one that's
been around forever.

4374
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:16,910
That's true too.

4375
01:56:16,910 --> 01:56:17,170
Yeah.

4376
01:56:17,170 --> 01:56:22,170
That's guys and just enjoy watching
their girls get rocked by monsters.

4377
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:26,390
Buddy of mine said that he met this girl
at a party and she was really hot and

4378
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:29,190
she was coming on to him and then all
the sudden this dude came over and

4379
01:56:29,191 --> 01:56:31,140
introduced himself as the
husband and the guy's like,

4380
01:56:31,141 --> 01:56:31,261
oh,

4381
01:56:31,261 --> 01:56:32,094
what the fuck?

4382
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:33,060
And the guy was like,

4383
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:33,421
no man,

4384
01:56:33,421 --> 01:56:33,751
it's cool.

4385
01:56:33,751 --> 01:56:34,081
It's cool.

4386
01:56:34,081 --> 01:56:35,400
It's cool that we swing.

4387
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:35,731
It's cool.

4388
01:56:35,731 --> 01:56:36,270
It's cool.

4389
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:36,720
And he was like,

4390
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:37,111
oh wow.

4391
01:56:37,111 --> 01:56:37,321
He goes,

4392
01:56:37,321 --> 01:56:38,340
if I didn't have a couple of drinks in me,

4393
01:56:38,341 --> 01:56:39,330
I would have never done this.

4394
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:40,951
Next thing you know,

4395
01:56:40,951 --> 01:56:43,560
they're in this outside patio
and this chick is blowing him.

4396
01:56:43,561 --> 01:56:47,100
While the husband gives
instructions to husband.

4397
01:56:47,101 --> 01:56:49,470
It was giving instructions.

4398
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:52,150
Really?

4399
01:56:52,150 --> 01:56:52,680
Yeah.

4400
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:52,891
Wow.

4401
01:56:52,891 --> 01:56:54,020
Maybe this guy's black too.

4402
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:57,540
Maybe it's just a black guys in
white women and white husbands.

4403
01:56:57,620 --> 01:57:00,450
Zorba the COC holding thing.

4404
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:03,210
A lot of the issues like
black men and white guy,

4405
01:57:03,211 --> 01:57:03,991
like white guys,

4406
01:57:03,991 --> 01:57:07,820
like black men to fuck their wives
because they think it's like this,

4407
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:11,310
like really like degrading kind of thing.

4408
01:57:11,311 --> 01:57:12,180
Like sexually.

4409
01:57:12,181 --> 01:57:12,570
They're like,

4410
01:57:12,570 --> 01:57:12,871
Ooh,

4411
01:57:12,871 --> 01:57:13,860
that's so dirty.

4412
01:57:13,861 --> 01:57:14,694
You know?

4413
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:15,391
He was like saying,

4414
01:57:15,391 --> 01:57:15,601
okay,

4415
01:57:15,601 --> 01:57:16,051
make them come.

4416
01:57:16,051 --> 01:57:16,470
Make them come.

4417
01:57:16,470 --> 01:57:17,310
Make them come in your mouth.

4418
01:57:17,311 --> 01:57:17,910
And he's like,

4419
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:18,241
he goes,

4420
01:57:18,241 --> 01:57:20,130
part of me just wanted
to get up and run away,

4421
01:57:20,131 --> 01:57:20,851
but it was two legs.

4422
01:57:20,851 --> 01:57:23,880
I was drunk and this girl was already
blown me and he goes to the was hot.

4423
01:57:23,881 --> 01:57:24,840
If the girl wasn't hot,

4424
01:57:24,841 --> 01:57:25,680
he would have just given up.

4425
01:57:25,681 --> 01:57:26,910
But it was just one of those like,

4426
01:57:26,911 --> 01:57:27,780
what am I doing?

4427
01:57:27,781 --> 01:57:28,740
The guys like rub his balls,

4428
01:57:28,741 --> 01:57:29,150
Roosevelt,

4429
01:57:29,150 --> 01:57:29,431
and he's like,

4430
01:57:29,431 --> 01:57:30,000
well,

4431
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:30,840
I got this dude,

4432
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:31,440
you know,

4433
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:31,920
I'm good.

4434
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:32,670
We don't need your help.

4435
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:33,503
We don't need any help.

4436
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:34,351
She can blow me,

4437
01:57:34,351 --> 01:57:34,980
but you can't.

4438
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:36,030
You can't talk back.

4439
01:57:36,031 --> 01:57:37,170
When I lived in Vegas,

4440
01:57:37,171 --> 01:57:37,950
that was like,

4441
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:38,071
I,

4442
01:57:38,071 --> 01:57:40,470
I was at this one casino and
they tried to pick me up.

4443
01:57:40,471 --> 01:57:41,310
They were swingers.

4444
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:42,010
Oh.

4445
01:57:42,010 --> 01:57:42,270
They're like,

4446
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:42,451
Hey,

4447
01:57:42,451 --> 01:57:43,110
what's up?

4448
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:43,710
What's up?

4449
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:44,820
This girls hitting on me.

4450
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:45,713
Was she hot?

4451
01:57:45,870 --> 01:57:46,321
Yeah,

4452
01:57:46,321 --> 01:57:47,370
she was vegas hot,

4453
01:57:47,371 --> 01:57:50,250
but like kind of slutty back then.

4454
01:57:50,251 --> 01:57:51,210
I love that shit.

4455
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:51,751
I will now.

4456
01:57:51,751 --> 01:57:52,441
I love that shit.

4457
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:53,274
What am I talking about?

4458
01:57:54,490 --> 01:57:57,270
I'm not judging it now
I'm into like a librarian.

4459
01:57:58,460 --> 01:57:59,820
I'm in the whatever brother.

4460
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:00,361
So,

4461
01:58:00,361 --> 01:58:00,571
uh,

4462
01:58:00,571 --> 01:58:01,100
yeah.

4463
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:01,561
And I'm like,

4464
01:58:01,561 --> 01:58:02,161
what are you going to do,

4465
01:58:02,161 --> 01:58:02,710
coach?

4466
01:58:02,710 --> 01:58:04,650
Are you going to sit in the
corner yelling out plays?

4467
01:58:04,950 --> 01:58:06,060
I can handle that shit.

4468
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,410
Just be weird to hump.

4469
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:08,940
Have somebody else's watching.

4470
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,050
You could handle that.

4471
01:58:10,051 --> 01:58:11,340
If a guy was knowing that I couldn't,

4472
01:58:11,341 --> 01:58:11,750
couldn't.

4473
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:12,000
Yeah.

4474
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,690
But I've had threesomes like the dirt
devil threesome where it's like you and

4475
01:58:15,691 --> 01:58:16,501
your buddy railing,

4476
01:58:16,501 --> 01:58:20,130
a chick given that's a buddy that's
not a guy's husband or girl's husband

4477
01:58:20,131 --> 01:58:20,650
rather.

4478
01:58:20,650 --> 01:58:21,060
Yeah.

4479
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:24,820
He's not sitting there judging and
given me scores and calling out play.

4480
01:58:25,050 --> 01:58:26,610
I just think the moment you come,

4481
01:58:26,611 --> 01:58:29,730
you would just want to run away so badly.

4482
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:30,121
You know?

4483
01:58:30,121 --> 01:58:33,270
The postnet syndrome
effect would be so hard.

4484
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:34,860
The depression that must just.

4485
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:37,800
How many women will never understand this,

4486
01:58:37,801 --> 01:58:42,700
but there's many times in a man's life
where your will convince you that this is

4487
01:58:42,701 --> 01:58:46,150
what you should be doing and then you
know that she's Kinda gross or you're kind

4488
01:58:46,151 --> 01:58:46,631
of gross.

4489
01:58:46,631 --> 01:58:49,780
So the situations gross or
she shouldn't be doing it,

4490
01:58:49,781 --> 01:58:50,650
but somebody that you're like,

4491
01:58:50,651 --> 01:58:50,891
yeah,

4492
01:58:50,891 --> 01:58:51,724
let's fucking do this.

4493
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:55,720
And then when you come to the
realization that you've been tricked,

4494
01:58:55,790 --> 01:58:57,730
there's nothing in the world like it.

4495
01:58:57,970 --> 01:58:58,660
It really.

4496
01:58:58,660 --> 01:58:59,860
It's a terrifying feeling.

4497
01:58:59,861 --> 01:59:03,250
It's like all of a sudden you have
woken up in the middle of a reality that

4498
01:59:03,251 --> 01:59:05,650
you've created while you were
under a trade quantum leap.

4499
01:59:05,950 --> 01:59:06,371
You're just like,

4500
01:59:06,371 --> 01:59:06,581
okay,

4501
01:59:06,581 --> 01:59:07,690
what's the situation here?

4502
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:08,950
Where they just do well,

4503
01:59:08,951 --> 01:59:09,980
it's like you wrote wake up for,

4504
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:10,300
you know,

4505
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:11,440
I do a bit about how you like,

4506
01:59:11,441 --> 01:59:12,970
it's like you're normal,

4507
01:59:12,971 --> 01:59:14,870
you're driving your life
until you have a hard on.

4508
01:59:14,890 --> 01:59:15,551
Then when you have a heart on,

4509
01:59:15,551 --> 01:59:18,550
it's like just sitting in the
back seat of a really long bus.

4510
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:19,960
Some other dude is driving it.

4511
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:20,501
That's what it's like.

4512
01:59:20,501 --> 01:59:20,801
And you're like,

4513
01:59:20,801 --> 01:59:21,251
where do we go?

4514
01:59:21,251 --> 01:59:22,061
What the fuck are we doing?

4515
01:59:22,061 --> 01:59:22,894
Where are we going?

4516
01:59:22,930 --> 01:59:23,390
And then when,

4517
01:59:23,390 --> 01:59:24,223
when you come,

4518
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:26,500
all of a sudden you wake up and you're
at the front of the bus holding the wheel

4519
01:59:26,501 --> 01:59:26,770
again.

4520
01:59:26,770 --> 01:59:27,010
Like,

4521
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:27,401
oh,

4522
01:59:27,401 --> 01:59:27,701
okay,

4523
01:59:27,701 --> 01:59:30,300
now I gotta get myself out
of this fucking mess in here.

4524
01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:30,730
You Dick.

4525
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:31,930
One hundred percent.

4526
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:32,610
Oh God.

4527
01:59:32,610 --> 01:59:33,790
There when I said it again.

4528
01:59:33,791 --> 01:59:34,730
You did it again.

4529
01:59:35,210 --> 01:59:35,910
Herea background.

4530
01:59:35,910 --> 01:59:36,970
We're going to wrap this bitch up.

4531
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:37,871
Where are you going?

4532
01:59:37,871 --> 01:59:38,290
Brian?

4533
01:59:38,290 --> 01:59:39,310
Got a little girl's bladder.

4534
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:40,333
He's

4535
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:41,860
A.

4536
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:42,240
Yeah.

4537
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:43,900
So that's such an interesting cat,

4538
01:59:43,901 --> 01:59:44,530
isn't he?

4539
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:46,630
He is just telling you
I can't follow things.

4540
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:47,861
He doesn't.

4541
01:59:47,861 --> 01:59:48,760
And it's very interesting.

4542
01:59:48,761 --> 01:59:49,571
We have a podcast.

4543
01:59:49,571 --> 01:59:49,741
I,

4544
01:59:49,741 --> 01:59:54,610
I know how excited Brian is about the
gas by how interactive he is if he's not

4545
01:59:54,611 --> 01:59:55,271
talking to the guests,

4546
01:59:55,271 --> 01:59:58,450
which makes me nervous right now
because he hasn't talked at all a while.

4547
01:59:58,451 --> 01:59:59,081
I've been here,

4548
01:59:59,081 --> 02:00:02,880
but we've both been
chatting up a storm and Qa,

4549
02:00:03,010 --> 02:00:04,030
chatty Cathy's here.

4550
02:00:04,031 --> 02:00:04,730
But uh,

4551
02:00:04,730 --> 02:00:06,550
it was like he just sits there quietly,

4552
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:07,090
like,

4553
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:09,010
come on and be interactive with me,

4554
02:00:09,011 --> 02:00:09,340
Dude.

4555
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:09,851
And he's like,

4556
02:00:09,851 --> 02:00:10,390
no,

4557
02:00:10,390 --> 02:00:11,470
I always got to have a girl.

4558
02:00:11,471 --> 02:00:13,420
It's almost like bring me to a beast.

4559
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:17,350
You always got to have a girl in the
room and when you bring a girl then he's

4560
02:00:17,351 --> 02:00:17,951
more interactive.

4561
02:00:17,951 --> 02:00:18,131
Oh,

4562
02:00:18,131 --> 02:00:18,640
100.

4563
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:18,791
Oh,

4564
02:00:18,791 --> 02:00:20,770
you can tell if he likes the porn star.

4565
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:22,930
He won't even let me talk.

4566
02:00:23,090 --> 02:00:23,471
Cuts me.

4567
02:00:23,471 --> 02:00:24,340
Obviously with running.

4568
02:00:24,341 --> 02:00:27,850
And this is why Brian is
so fucking interested in
podcasting is because all of a

4569
02:00:27,851 --> 02:00:29,770
sudden it's put him in
contact with all these freaks.

4570
02:00:29,790 --> 02:00:30,130
Right.

4571
02:00:30,130 --> 02:00:32,050
Do you remember when I did that he supply,

4572
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:36,050
even though I met both of the
girls I've dated off the podcast.

4573
02:00:36,210 --> 02:00:37,240
It's sort of,

4574
02:00:37,241 --> 02:00:38,510
but you know,

4575
02:00:39,570 --> 02:00:41,380
but you met the first one through comedy

4576
02:00:43,170 --> 02:00:44,003
when I did the,

4577
02:00:44,030 --> 02:00:48,250
your podcast the first time and he was
talking about how he thought podcasting

4578
02:00:48,251 --> 02:00:51,880
was a new casting couch and we both
laughed at him and then it's true.

4579
02:00:51,881 --> 02:00:52,241
It's like,

4580
02:00:52,241 --> 02:00:52,481
you know,

4581
02:00:52,481 --> 02:00:52,870
you can,

4582
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:55,200
you can work that to get some chicks here.

4583
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:55,331
Like,

4584
02:00:55,331 --> 02:00:55,481
Hey,

4585
02:00:55,481 --> 02:00:55,620
I'm,

4586
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:55,850
I'm,

4587
02:00:55,850 --> 02:00:57,490
well that's the thing
about a lot of porn stars.

4588
02:00:57,530 --> 02:00:59,350
They're looking to promote their shit.

4589
02:00:59,351 --> 02:01:01,510
They were looking to promote
like weekends at clubs,

4590
02:01:01,511 --> 02:01:02,560
just like a comedian is,

4591
02:01:02,561 --> 02:01:02,741
you know,

4592
02:01:02,741 --> 02:01:03,491
when they go on the road,

4593
02:01:03,491 --> 02:01:06,040
like Brian went on the
robos girl and he's like,

4594
02:01:06,041 --> 02:01:07,000
it's just like a comic.

4595
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:08,740
Like you go and you
have shows and you know,

4596
02:01:08,741 --> 02:01:10,900
you get paid and the club
owners kind of a Dick.

4597
02:01:10,901 --> 02:01:11,734
It's like all the same,

4598
02:01:11,950 --> 02:01:12,401
best,

4599
02:01:12,401 --> 02:01:13,010
same shit.

4600
02:01:13,010 --> 02:01:14,890
First date of dating a
porn star usually goes.

4601
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:16,810
So do you have any html skills?

4602
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:19,040
You,

4603
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:20,680
they try to get you to do their websites,

4604
02:01:21,850 --> 02:01:22,500
their websites.

4605
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:27,500
Now I've always found the girls have
somebody in their life who runs all that

4606
02:01:28,631 --> 02:01:29,200
stuff.

4607
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:29,800
Yeah.

4608
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:30,160
Yeah.

4609
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:30,610
It's,

4610
02:01:30,610 --> 02:01:30,970
you know,

4611
02:01:30,970 --> 02:01:31,111
they,

4612
02:01:31,111 --> 02:01:34,360
they take some guy who they know is not
going anywhere and that guy will start

4613
02:01:34,361 --> 02:01:35,920
managing them and taking
them on the road and,

4614
02:01:35,921 --> 02:01:36,250
you know,

4615
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:39,620
be their bodyguard and hold their money
and make sure the guys can't finger them

4616
02:01:39,621 --> 02:01:39,951
when they're up.

4617
02:01:39,951 --> 02:01:40,610
They're

4618
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:43,110
sticking their asshole on their
face because that's what it is.

4619
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:45,560
I started taking martial arts
of Brian and Brian had to go,

4620
02:01:45,561 --> 02:01:45,801
hey,

4621
02:01:45,801 --> 02:01:47,030
no finger in guys.

4622
02:01:47,570 --> 02:01:48,403
Come on,

4623
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:53,620
come on with dirty fingernails
or buttle freckles this weekend,

4624
02:01:54,411 --> 02:01:55,550
this Friday night.

4625
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:56,090
Um,

4626
02:01:56,090 --> 02:02:00,110
it will be me and Duncan at the comedy
and magic show comedy and magic club and

4627
02:02:00,111 --> 02:02:00,651
her mostly beach,

4628
02:02:00,651 --> 02:02:01,101
California.

4629
02:02:01,101 --> 02:02:02,360
There's two shows.

4630
02:02:02,510 --> 02:02:03,920
Seven and 9:30.

4631
02:02:04,210 --> 02:02:04,560
Yes,

4632
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:05,060
seven.

4633
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:05,510
I know.

4634
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:06,051
Ridiculous.

4635
02:02:06,051 --> 02:02:09,830
But that's how they roll and foremost
would be that headroom community.

4636
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:13,640
My buddy wants to get you out in Santa
Barbara or Santa Barbara was he got up

4637
02:02:13,641 --> 02:02:15,680
there a couple of clubs.

4638
02:02:15,700 --> 02:02:16,970
They want us to comedy clubs.

4639
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,530
No one's a rock club.

4640
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:19,120
In other words,

4641
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:19,953
the theater.

4642
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:20,560
He's always,

4643
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:20,830
you know,

4644
02:02:20,830 --> 02:02:22,720
he wanted to hit up your age
and try to see if you can get.

4645
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:23,130
Yeah,

4646
02:02:23,130 --> 02:02:23,963
give me his information.

4647
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:24,210
I'll.

4648
02:02:24,210 --> 02:02:24,411
Yeah,

4649
02:02:24,411 --> 02:02:25,280
I'll go to Santa Barbara.

4650
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:26,030
It's not that far.

4651
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:26,330
Yup,

4652
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:26,770
I'll do that.

4653
02:02:26,770 --> 02:02:27,561
He's a great guy too.

4654
02:02:27,561 --> 02:02:27,890
Okay,

4655
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:28,071
cool.

4656
02:02:28,071 --> 02:02:28,910
That's no further for me.

4657
02:02:28,911 --> 02:02:29,690
That Ontario.

4658
02:02:29,690 --> 02:02:29,940
Yeah,

4659
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:30,500
I'll go that way.

4660
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:30,981
Santa Barbara.

4661
02:02:30,981 --> 02:02:31,671
Just the opposite way.

4662
02:02:31,671 --> 02:02:31,850
Yeah.

4663
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:33,350
Santa Barbara's fucking beautiful.

4664
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:34,850
Incredible houses out there.

4665
02:02:34,851 --> 02:02:35,360
Huh?

4666
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:38,600
See all those ones that burned down
like the dude from a back to the future.

4667
02:02:38,601 --> 02:02:39,141
The old guy,

4668
02:02:39,141 --> 02:02:40,000
those professors.

4669
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:40,471
Oh yeah,

4670
02:02:40,471 --> 02:02:40,601
yeah,

4671
02:02:40,601 --> 02:02:40,910
yeah.

4672
02:02:40,910 --> 02:02:41,721
His house burnt down.

4673
02:02:41,721 --> 02:02:42,531
That sucks.

4674
02:02:42,531 --> 02:02:42,651
Yeah.

4675
02:02:42,651 --> 02:02:46,130
They had these giant mansions out there
and the fires just cut through a whole

4676
02:02:46,131 --> 02:02:46,964
neighborhood.

4677
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:47,811
That's crazy shit.

4678
02:02:47,811 --> 02:02:51,260
When you realized that fire can do that
and there's three colleges out there.

4679
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:51,770
Yeah,

4680
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:52,371
there's quite a few.

4681
02:02:52,371 --> 02:02:52,880
Yeah,

4682
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:54,950
there's like three topping colleges.

4683
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:58,280
One of them had like the highest rate
of stds of any college in the country.

4684
02:02:58,281 --> 02:02:58,671
So you know,

4685
02:02:58,671 --> 02:03:01,610
the rate of stds have any in the country.

4686
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:02,750
Wow.

4687
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:03,670
So you know the party,

4688
02:03:03,671 --> 02:03:04,310
it's warm out.

4689
02:03:04,310 --> 02:03:06,290
It's one people fuck more probably.

4690
02:03:06,291 --> 02:03:07,124
Right.

4691
02:03:07,290 --> 02:03:09,330
She's an outside college.

4692
02:03:09,370 --> 02:03:10,370
Remember when you were in college,

4693
02:03:10,371 --> 02:03:11,180
you're just like,

4694
02:03:11,180 --> 02:03:13,200
just tapping ass left and right.

4695
02:03:13,201 --> 02:03:13,730
And you're like,

4696
02:03:13,730 --> 02:03:15,390
it's always going to be like this.

4697
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:16,910
At some point you're like,

4698
02:03:16,911 --> 02:03:17,510
oh,

4699
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:18,680
I didn't go away for college.

4700
02:03:18,770 --> 02:03:23,120
I went to a college in Boston so that
I could still train and compete martial

4701
02:03:23,121 --> 02:03:23,810
arts tournaments.

4702
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:27,140
So I stayed for the first couple of years.

4703
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:29,510
I was at home still until I was 20.

4704
02:03:29,810 --> 02:03:30,800
When I was 20 I moved out.

4705
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:31,851
And when,

4706
02:03:31,851 --> 02:03:32,480
uh,

4707
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:32,811
I would,

4708
02:03:32,811 --> 02:03:33,140
uh,

4709
02:03:33,140 --> 02:03:33,771
go to school.

4710
02:03:33,771 --> 02:03:35,180
I would just go to school
for the day and then leave.

4711
02:03:35,181 --> 02:03:35,871
I had no like,

4712
02:03:35,871 --> 02:03:37,760
school interaction I had no,

4713
02:03:37,761 --> 02:03:38,900
I didn't go to parties.

4714
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:40,310
I didn't get laid in college at all.

4715
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:42,300
College was the high school.

4716
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:43,340
Yes.

4717
02:03:43,340 --> 02:03:46,100
But college is a biggest
drought of bisexual career ever.

4718
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:46,790
Really?

4719
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:46,980
Yeah.

4720
02:03:46,980 --> 02:03:47,450
Yeah.

4721
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:50,000
Also the most insecure in
college too because then it was,

4722
02:03:50,030 --> 02:03:50,863
I was um,

4723
02:03:51,170 --> 02:03:55,370
making this transition from being this
person who concentrated on only martial

4724
02:03:55,371 --> 02:03:56,660
arts my entire life.

4725
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:59,060
Literally barely paid attention to school.

4726
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:00,073
So all of a sudden,

4727
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:00,881
you know,

4728
02:04:00,881 --> 02:04:02,060
becoming like 18,

4729
02:04:02,061 --> 02:04:03,770
19 out in the real world and going,

4730
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:06,260
how the fuck am I gonna support myself.

4731
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:06,591
You know,

4732
02:04:06,591 --> 02:04:11,000
I was teaching taekwondo at
Boston University and I had
my own school in revere,

4733
02:04:11,001 --> 02:04:11,691
but I was like,

4734
02:04:11,691 --> 02:04:12,320
what am I going to do man?

4735
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:15,230
I just do this for the rest of my life
because this is not really what I want to

4736
02:04:15,231 --> 02:04:15,321
do.

4737
02:04:15,321 --> 02:04:16,154
I want to compete,

4738
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:18,060
but there's no money
in competing and then,

4739
02:04:18,061 --> 02:04:19,840
and then you start thinking
about brain damage,

4740
02:04:19,850 --> 02:04:20,571
all sorts of other things.

4741
02:04:20,571 --> 02:04:20,871
And I was like,

4742
02:04:20,871 --> 02:04:21,291
God damn,

4743
02:04:21,291 --> 02:04:22,280
I might become a loser,

4744
02:04:22,281 --> 02:04:22,551
you know,

4745
02:04:22,551 --> 02:04:25,880
I had no definitive direction
until I went into stand up.

4746
02:04:26,060 --> 02:04:28,400
I was just competing and
then worrying about shit.

4747
02:04:28,610 --> 02:04:29,900
From the time I was like 19,

4748
02:04:29,901 --> 02:04:32,600
I had started to realize like maybe
this was like a dead end route.

4749
02:04:32,601 --> 02:04:33,620
Like where am I going with this?

4750
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:34,880
Because I also,

4751
02:04:34,881 --> 02:04:36,350
when I was 19 I had some.

4752
02:04:36,440 --> 02:04:38,670
I've seen some of the worst knockouts

4753
02:04:38,910 --> 02:04:39,990
around that age.

4754
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:43,590
I'd seen some bad head kick
knockouts where I was like,

4755
02:04:43,591 --> 02:04:43,951
Whoa,

4756
02:04:43,951 --> 02:04:45,790
like what made you know
what if that happens,

4757
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:46,860
I may go,

4758
02:04:47,210 --> 02:04:48,210
go flat line,

4759
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:48,871
dude.

4760
02:04:48,871 --> 02:04:50,760
I saw a lot of guys get
kicked in the head man.

4761
02:04:50,761 --> 02:04:53,160
A lot of guys get like
seriously flatlined,

4762
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:56,700
like just like that dude in the subway
where the guy sucker punches him.

4763
02:04:56,940 --> 02:04:57,751
I've seen a lot of that.

4764
02:04:57,751 --> 02:04:58,471
When you get kicked,

4765
02:04:58,471 --> 02:04:59,880
like taekwondo kicks to the head.

4766
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:01,290
They don't land that often,

4767
02:05:01,291 --> 02:05:01,711
but man,

4768
02:05:01,711 --> 02:05:03,550
when they land it's like
getting hit with a bat.

4769
02:05:03,580 --> 02:05:06,330
There was a video on this
website that's really cool.

4770
02:05:06,331 --> 02:05:11,331
Called Barstool sports.com and they like
it just a fun sports website and they

4771
02:05:11,881 --> 02:05:15,260
showed these guys mma fighting
in their living room and the w,

4772
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:15,780
you know,

4773
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:16,770
the first time they fight,

4774
02:05:16,771 --> 02:05:17,790
the one guy tapped,

4775
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:18,721
the second one,

4776
02:05:18,721 --> 02:05:18,930
dude,

4777
02:05:18,930 --> 02:05:19,720
they're fighting in living.

4778
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:20,830
Do just head kicks him.

4779
02:05:20,831 --> 02:05:21,960
The guy just goes down,

4780
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:27,260
hits his head basically on like the marble
of the fireplace and like lights out.

4781
02:05:28,050 --> 02:05:28,883
Oh God.

4782
02:05:29,190 --> 02:05:30,540
See I didn't get late in high school,

4783
02:05:30,541 --> 02:05:33,810
but then I went to college
and it was just insanity.

4784
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:34,411
Sure.

4785
02:05:34,411 --> 02:05:35,610
If I went to a college,

4786
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:36,600
if I had actually gone away,

4787
02:05:36,610 --> 02:05:37,470
so I went to unl.

4788
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:38,400
Oh,

4789
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:42,290
Jesus just didn't even pretend you're
going to learn anything and I didn't.

4790
02:05:42,430 --> 02:05:43,320
Did I admit it?

4791
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:44,330
I moved there.

4792
02:05:44,330 --> 02:05:46,500
I wanted to do stand up as a lot of drugs.

4793
02:05:47,070 --> 02:05:47,420
I know,

4794
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:48,080
you know,

4795
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:50,820
I didn't really get into
anything like that until later.

4796
02:05:50,850 --> 02:05:52,620
Much is vegas as a real drug problem.

4797
02:05:52,621 --> 02:05:53,020
Right.

4798
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:55,250
There's different vegas man.

4799
02:05:55,510 --> 02:05:56,400
Sounds crazy.

4800
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:58,230
Like it was like,

4801
02:05:58,260 --> 02:05:59,730
you know how there was the modern,

4802
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:00,280
the news,

4803
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:01,680
the mob vegas.

4804
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:02,130
Yeah.

4805
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:03,960
I was out there kind of during the,

4806
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:04,591
during the,

4807
02:06:04,591 --> 02:06:04,890
uh,

4808
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:07,740
family friendly vegas that
happened for a little while.

4809
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:08,040
Right?

4810
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:08,311
Yeah.

4811
02:06:08,311 --> 02:06:10,890
And then when I left and it became mma,

4812
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:11,450
you know,

4813
02:06:11,450 --> 02:06:12,870
Terrordome Vegas,

4814
02:06:12,871 --> 02:06:13,910
that is just,

4815
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:14,550
you know,

4816
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:14,971
where they're like,

4817
02:06:14,971 --> 02:06:15,331
screw it,

4818
02:06:15,331 --> 02:06:17,160
we're just the party destination.

4819
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:17,760
And they,

4820
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:18,420
how do they,

4821
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:19,650
how do you think they made that decision?

4822
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:20,813
You were living there.

4823
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:22,710
The family wasn't making as much money.

4824
02:06:23,130 --> 02:06:23,730
That's what it was.

4825
02:06:23,730 --> 02:06:25,200
Now this one color Fred's name.

4826
02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:26,070
You'd have a joke about,

4827
02:06:26,071 --> 02:06:26,251
you know,

4828
02:06:26,251 --> 02:06:27,870
you don't take a hooker to Disneyland.

4829
02:06:27,871 --> 02:06:28,321
It's just like,

4830
02:06:28,321 --> 02:06:30,390
why would you make Vegas
a family destination?

4831
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:31,110
Yeah.

4832
02:06:31,110 --> 02:06:32,490
It was just a place where it's,

4833
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:33,353
you know,

4834
02:06:33,390 --> 02:06:35,310
it was just what's there for the kids.

4835
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:36,150
Yeah.

4836
02:06:36,150 --> 02:06:36,780
Well,

4837
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:38,570
at one point there was a treasurer,

4838
02:06:38,630 --> 02:06:43,630
a like a circus circus had this huge
like park and then the mgm grand tried to

4839
02:06:44,251 --> 02:06:45,084
create a park.

4840
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:45,721
It just like,

4841
02:06:45,721 --> 02:06:47,400
you're not going to bring your
kids where there's gambling.

4842
02:06:47,401 --> 02:06:48,490
It sounds like a good idea.

4843
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:49,620
People do all the time,

4844
02:06:49,950 --> 02:06:51,650
but not like what they wrote.

4845
02:06:51,770 --> 02:06:53,550
They were hoping to pull from Orlando,

4846
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:55,261
Orlando,

4847
02:06:55,261 --> 02:06:56,510
let's go to vegas and just.

4848
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:58,710
It's never gonna happen,

4849
02:06:58,711 --> 02:06:59,010
man.

4850
02:06:59,010 --> 02:07:02,220
It's interesting when a bunch of
different metamorphoses have gone on,

4851
02:07:02,670 --> 02:07:03,330
you know,

4852
02:07:03,330 --> 02:07:05,600
and now it's Kinda like
it's in a different place.

4853
02:07:05,610 --> 02:07:06,900
Like Vegas is broke.

4854
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:08,213
Is that what it is now?

4855
02:07:09,710 --> 02:07:10,543
Dead.

4856
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:12,330
It's just definitely have lost a lot.

4857
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:15,660
Well they sit down like 50 percent men,

4858
02:07:16,590 --> 02:07:20,460
50 percent and there's all those shopping
centers that they started to build and

4859
02:07:20,461 --> 02:07:22,830
then whatever happened and now
they're just sitting there.

4860
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:23,011
Yeah,

4861
02:07:23,011 --> 02:07:23,844
there's a few of those.

4862
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:25,703
Weird.

4863
02:07:25,790 --> 02:07:27,330
Where's it in Saudi Arabia?

4864
02:07:27,331 --> 02:07:29,050
They have that too or yeah,

4865
02:07:29,130 --> 02:07:31,440
a huge bill and that money's gone.

4866
02:07:31,820 --> 02:07:32,653
Stop that.

4867
02:07:32,670 --> 02:07:35,560
It's so weird that the same
amount of people can exist.

4868
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:36,100
The same

4869
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:37,000
amount of metals,

4870
02:07:37,010 --> 02:07:38,080
Sam Lao steel,

4871
02:07:38,081 --> 02:07:39,090
same amount of minerals.

4872
02:07:39,091 --> 02:07:42,670
Same amount of resources and yet somehow
or another there's no money anymore.

4873
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:45,280
It's so strange.

4874
02:07:45,310 --> 02:07:45,910
It's like,

4875
02:07:45,910 --> 02:07:46,300
well,

4876
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:46,810
you know,

4877
02:07:46,810 --> 02:07:47,081
a.

4878
02:07:47,081 --> 02:07:49,360
everybody was under an illusion before.

4879
02:07:49,361 --> 02:07:49,511
Well,

4880
02:07:49,511 --> 02:07:49,810

4881
02:07:49,810 --> 02:07:51,490
can you trick me again please?

4882
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:51,740
Yeah.

4883
02:07:51,740 --> 02:07:54,250
We tricked the world again
and keep this rolling.

4884
02:07:54,620 --> 02:07:55,241
It's like,

4885
02:07:55,241 --> 02:07:56,074
where does the,

4886
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:56,560
like,

4887
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:57,393
where's the money?

4888
02:07:57,610 --> 02:07:57,960
It's,

4889
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:01,990
there was money to make money are
way too stupid for this conversation.

4890
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:03,593
You know what it is?

4891
02:08:04,460 --> 02:08:05,200
I was like,

4892
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:06,160
where's the beef commercial?

4893
02:08:06,161 --> 02:08:06,994
Where's the money?

4894
02:08:07,110 --> 02:08:08,530
It's rich people hoarding.

4895
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:09,393
That's what's going on.

4896
02:08:09,430 --> 02:08:10,750
Rich people hoarding everything.

4897
02:08:10,990 --> 02:08:13,360
Friday night comedy Magic
Club in Hermosa Beach.

4898
02:08:13,361 --> 02:08:14,200
It will sell out.

4899
02:08:14,201 --> 02:08:14,680
Trust me,

4900
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:15,790
Duncan trussell's with me.

4901

And um,

4902
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:18,580
I don't know who else is
going to come with me,

4903
02:08:18,581 --> 02:08:19,280
but somebody else too.

4904
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:20,230
I try to get Tripoli.

4905
02:08:20,380 --> 02:08:21,070
I wouldn't do.

4906
02:08:21,070 --> 02:08:22,320
We haven't gigged together in a while.

4907
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:24,430
I started doing some gigs together.

4908
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:25,241
You know what I'm doing?

4909

4913
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:31,200
The next following Friday.

4914
02:08:31,201 --> 02:08:33,140
So they're done now.

4915
02:08:33,290 --> 02:08:35,530
The UFC vendelay Silva versus Kang Lee

4916
02:08:37,420 --> 02:08:40,950
shogun versus Henderson
when they are doing.

4917
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:42,360
I don't know what I did
in a past life dude,

4918
02:08:42,361 --> 02:08:43,194
but I hooked it up.

4919
02:08:43,630 --> 02:08:45,850
You did this job December first.

4920
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:47,330
December first.

4921
02:08:47,330 --> 02:08:50,200
Now convinced me I can't come.

4922
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:51,220
You can't.

4923
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:52,030
I can't come.

4924
02:08:52,030 --> 02:08:52,391
Brian,

4925
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:53,200
work on it.

4926
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:53,800
Brian.

4927
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:56,890
I figure on the good things
with the new podcast place.

4928
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:59,140
You gotta start working
on the business side.

4929
02:08:59,141 --> 02:09:01,060
We talked about that and
we'll keep talking about that.

4930
02:09:01,061 --> 02:09:03,040
You know Brian's podcast,

4931
02:09:03,041 --> 02:09:03,491
death squad.

4932
02:09:03,491 --> 02:09:04,660
For anybody who wants to sponsor it.

4933
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:07,050
We were talking to the fleshlight.

4934
02:09:07,090 --> 02:09:08,170
Hopefully they'll come through with it,

4935
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:09,640
but Brian's got A.

4936
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:12,880
I mean it's always in the
top 20 of itunes comedy.

4937
02:09:12,910 --> 02:09:16,480
There's a bunch of funny Comic Sans Aaa
has a show on called the naughty show.

4938
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:18,820
There's a Thompson Gaura and his wife,

4939
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:19,713
Mrs Laura.

4940
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:21,670
They have a show called your mom's house.

4941
02:09:21,671 --> 02:09:22,920
The whole lineup is great.

4942
02:09:22,930 --> 02:09:26,260
There's no bad one run in Washington
and now has one called the bone zone.

4943
02:09:26,350 --> 02:09:27,730
I liked that name and it.

4944
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:28,843
What it is is free.

4945
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:29,141
Okay.

4946
02:09:29,141 --> 02:09:30,430
It's free podcasts and you know,

4947
02:09:30,431 --> 02:09:32,920
if you look up for some shit to
listen to at work and by the way,

4948
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:34,960
all the people that I
saw in England weekend,

4949
02:09:34,990 --> 02:09:35,860
thank you very much.

4950
02:09:35,861 --> 02:09:37,780
That was what a fucking awesome,

4951
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:41,260
polite crowd and 90 percent
of them are like podcast fans.

4952
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:42,460
It was cool as fuck dude.

4953
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:44,980
One guy had a a t shirt on.

4954
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:46,770
So my protons,

4955
02:09:46,830 --> 02:09:48,970
I like existed in pre big bang conditions.

4956
02:09:48,971 --> 02:09:49,750
Anybody wants to change that?

4957
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:50,350
You got to come through me.

4958
02:09:50,350 --> 02:09:51,970
He had a tee shirt on without written out.

4959
02:09:52,190 --> 02:09:52,781
It was dope.

4960
02:09:52,781 --> 02:09:55,270
And then another guy had a desk wide,

4961
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:56,260
a lineup,

4962
02:09:56,260 --> 02:09:57,190
tee-shirt reservoir,

4963
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,560
reservoir dogs with all of our faces.

4964
02:09:59,710 --> 02:10:00,700
It was really dope.

4965
02:10:00,701 --> 02:10:00,881
Hey,

4966
02:10:00,881 --> 02:10:01,720
have you ever thought about.

4967
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:06,780
I was telling a Red Bandana that he should
take that thing that turned into a t

4968
02:10:07,121 --> 02:10:10,780
shirt and try to sell it to
make money for the desk water,

4969
02:10:10,781 --> 02:10:13,690
something like that where we're
going to definitely know we did this.

4970
02:10:13,691 --> 02:10:13,960
Uh,

4971
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:14,381
this thing.

4972
02:10:14,381 --> 02:10:15,310
I'm going to talk to this guy.

4973
02:10:15,350 --> 02:10:15,730
Um,

4974
02:10:15,730 --> 02:10:16,630
how cool is that?

4975
02:10:16,660 --> 02:10:18,490
If you don't always talking
about there's a gentleman,

4976
02:10:18,491 --> 02:10:18,910
what's his name?

4977
02:10:18,910 --> 02:10:19,743
What's the guy's name?

4978
02:10:19,910 --> 02:10:21,050
It's a caught me on God,

4979
02:10:21,230 --> 02:10:23,080
something sweatpants
or something like that.

4980
02:10:24,190 --> 02:10:26,530
Casual sweatpants.com.

4981
02:10:26,770 --> 02:10:27,670
I think it is that his name.

4982
02:10:27,970 --> 02:10:28,391
But anyway,

4983
02:10:28,391 --> 02:10:29,410
he made this cool thing,

4984
02:10:29,411 --> 02:10:32,440
the Joe Rogan experience
podcast and it's all these uh,

4985
02:10:32,620 --> 02:10:35,960
animated pictures of like
Kevin Smith and Ari Shaffir.

4986
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:41,840
I'm excited about Sam Aaa
Zombie like me and Joey is,

4987
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:42,380
and you know,

4988
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:42,981
everybody's in it.

4989
02:10:42,981 --> 02:10:43,081
It's,

4990
02:10:43,081 --> 02:10:44,120
it's Dunkin's in it.

4991
02:10:44,121 --> 02:10:46,550
It's really fucking
awesome at and an honor.

4992
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:49,840
And that's one of the coolest things
about this podcast is this community that

4993
02:10:49,841 --> 02:10:53,690
it's sort of brought together and that's
not something we take lightly at all.

4994
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:54,050
You know,

4995
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:54,600
I'm,

4996
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:57,150
I'm amazed and I'm honored
by it all and it's a,

4997
02:10:57,190 --> 02:10:58,610
it's kind of humbling and I don't,

4998
02:10:58,850 --> 02:11:00,040
I never know what to say.

4999
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:03,190
I'll click on some link and someone will
say something I made for your podcast

5000
02:11:03,191 --> 02:11:03,981
and I'll click it on Lincoln.

5001
02:11:03,981 --> 02:11:04,940
It's just awesome.

5002
02:11:05,210 --> 02:11:08,750
Inspirational rant to tied
to music and you know,

5003
02:11:08,970 --> 02:11:10,310
you listened to it and you're like,

5004
02:11:10,311 --> 02:11:12,680
well that's why you can't interrupt
the rants broke because they'll,

5005
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:13,730
they'll take those.

5006
02:11:14,030 --> 02:11:14,930
So you've got to be careful.

5007
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:19,930
What I do now as a kid for
foremost sweatpants is the
name of my podcast where I

5008
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:23,660
call red bands rant and we do it a half
an hour in the podcast where he can talk

5009
02:11:23,661 --> 02:11:27,980
about whatever he wants because he always
will be jamming and all of a sudden

5010
02:11:27,981 --> 02:11:29,770
it'd be like left turn out of nowhere.

5011
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:30,141
We're like,

5012
02:11:30,141 --> 02:11:30,891
what was.

5013
02:11:30,891 --> 02:11:31,671
Sometimes that's okay,

5014
02:11:31,671 --> 02:11:33,670
but you got to let people rent when
they were in the middle of a rain.

5015
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:37,010
Can't stop it because then the stop one
of these cool videos that gets made.

5016
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,180
Guys have animated them.

5017
02:11:38,181 --> 02:11:39,560
We've got a couple of
guys have animated them.

5018
02:11:39,561 --> 02:11:40,394
It's fucking awesome.

5019
02:11:40,490 --> 02:11:42,320
And Kevin Pereira from
the tech of the show.

5020
02:11:42,321 --> 02:11:43,154
He's got a wee.

5021
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:46,310
He wants to figure out a way to
animate it with his production company.

5022
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:47,780
So we do that.

5023
02:11:47,781 --> 02:11:48,021
Yeah,

5024
02:11:48,021 --> 02:11:51,350
because there's so many times people
have told crazy fucking stories and those

5025
02:11:51,351 --> 02:11:53,960
stories can make awesome
animated little clips.

5026
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:58,220
You just have to have someone
sit through the 10,000 hours of,

5027
02:11:58,270 --> 02:11:58,660
you know,

5028
02:11:58,660 --> 02:11:59,000
we got to.

5029
02:11:59,000 --> 02:11:59,960
This was like 1:50,

5030
02:11:59,961 --> 02:12:01,510
two was this number with numbers.

5031
02:12:02,070 --> 02:12:03,990
I think it's like 1:54.

5032
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:04,790
Is it really?

5033
02:12:04,790 --> 02:12:05,930
One hundred 54 podcasts.

5034
02:12:05,931 --> 02:12:08,500
Each one of them is at least two
hours and some of them are more so.

5035
02:12:08,510 --> 02:12:09,380
What's the longest one?

5036
02:12:09,590 --> 02:12:10,423
Kevin Smith.

5037
02:12:10,570 --> 02:12:12,020
That was like three and
a half hours I think.

5038
