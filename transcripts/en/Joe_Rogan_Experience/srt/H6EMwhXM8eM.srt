1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,820
Trying my day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,840
There's very few things that are as
painful as listening to bad corner work.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,870
Oh,
that's fun.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,350
Oh yeah.
I went down to his liver and a quarter I

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,740
go,
he just read.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,530
You don't want him to throw a right hand
right now.

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,200
You know.
Let him keep that here so the liver is

8
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,700
protected and I go,
yeah,

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,050
that's an idiot.
Exactly.

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,200
Who Does it see that?
Did you watch the fights this weekend?

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,273
Yeah,
I did.

12
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,310
What did you think about steep and
Allison?

13
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,440
That was crazy.

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,290
So crazy.
I might differ.

15
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,180
Or three or four last punches you gave
there on an inch.

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,050
They're all exact at the same spot.
It's got really good precision.

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,420
Yeah,
just stopped him and he got hit hard.

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,750
He waved it off,
but then that guillotine and we know 11

19
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:48,000
guillotines.
I believe that he had beats right and

20
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:49,920
tight once.
People being a one time I say,

21
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,820
I want to feel it.
I go,

22
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,470
Whoa,
this is a really tight guilty.

23
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,750
But he got out.
He's in a.

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,490
he's a freak athlete.
He really is,

25
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,020
and he's a very likable guy.

26
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,990
He's awesome.
Steve is a good guy.

27
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,300
We were talking about his composure.
Yes sir.

28
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,340
Yes.
So composed like in Brazil when he

29
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:08,360
fought for breach you to stare down.
He's just dead faced.

30
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,600
He's got his own dead face.
It's not like a fade or dead face or

31
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:14,030
cane dead phase.
He's got his own dead phase,

32
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,970
but those guys that can just stay
completely calm,

33
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,880
you know,
in that incredible environment of being

34
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:23,840
there in Brazil.
Forty 5,000 plus people screaming for

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,120
breezy overdue and he just shuts his
lights out.

36
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,640
One of the things on our own or our main
battle right,

37
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:31,580
is being able to,
to control ourselves and he's looks to

38
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:34,880
have mastered that ability to control
his own emotions,

39
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:36,590
to make sure he's directing the energy
in the right path.

40
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:38,240
So Steep Bay,
good job.

41
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:39,090
Could ask Papa.
Oh,

42
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,900
he's a bad motherfucker.
Would it be interesting to see if

43
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:45,200
someone got into his head the way like
you and dominic were going after each

44
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:47,410
other or the way connor got into all
those head?

45
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,580
I guess that was a masterclass and fuck,
and when someone's head absolutely mean

46
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,490
connor took,
although completely out of his element

47
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,180
where he was just so frazzled by the
time they actually met each other inside

48
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:00,200
the octagon.
It was just,

49
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,960
I think we're at the overeem and the
just shameless Hoven Rosie.

50
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,150
Rosie's intimidating everybody the way
she is and she wants.

51
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:12,240
She stood at the stare down.
That's when she lost because she

52
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:16,050
realized holly didn't care at all.
She was just there.

53
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm going to hurt you.
That was.

54
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,900
And that's the same as everybody's
intimidated by overeem and you shouldn't

55
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,640
be because he's a monster.
But I think over and could see in his

56
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:26,190
face already hit.
He's not intimidated.

57
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:29,180
This guy has absolutely no.
And then when you fight a guy like that,

58
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:31,170
that,
that little voice starts playing in

59
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:33,180
your,
in your mind when it gets bad,

60
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,340
you know,
and that's why maybe we saw these crazy

61
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:37,020
things of running away,
you know,

62
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,970
which I,
I say it's a good thing because I said

63
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,280
the same thing.
I guess Cortland Mcgregor,

64
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,430
but you know,
for a big,

65
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,230
huge heavy weight,
it doesn't look good,

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,030
you know,
and now you,

67
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,020
you set yourself up more as effective
because he's following you in fact.

68
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,080
And that all is an input in your,
in your own brain because now you start

69
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,150
telling yourself,
oh,

70
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,540
everybody thinks I'm a,
uh,

71
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,080
I'm hurt or that I'm afraid of.
Am I afraid I'm,

72
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,980
you know,
there's the whole cow thing that goes on

73
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,750
in the mind.
There's always these two forces I say to

74
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,700
one force wants to quit,
that Yoda voice wants to go,

75
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,690
right?
You know,

76
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:06,550
you're a really bad situation.
And then say,

77
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,770
okay,
call it quits Colloquy,

78
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,790
wait,
wait to know that.

79
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,270
Let's just,
let's just see what happens,

80
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,140
you know,
and then suddenly you come out of the

81
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:17,590
situation like I was.
I was about to step in my second fight

82
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,060
and then the audience started cheering
for him and then my ego to go over.

83
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:22,631
I go,
okay,

84
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:25,090
I get out of the situation.
And then 30 seconds later I knocked him

85
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:26,650
out with the need to deliver and I go,
okay,

86
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,420
this is the last time I'm going to think
like that because before the I stay away

87
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,230
from the bad voice.
