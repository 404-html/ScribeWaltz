1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,180
Hello bitches.
Have you ever seen that Russian lady

2
00:00:04,181 --> 00:00:07,390
that can pick up?
I think she can carry like 32 kilograms

3
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:09,580
for their pussy.
It might be more than that.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,500
It's like more than 70 pounds I believe.
She can show.

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,321
I haven't checked.
Yeah.

6
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:18,760
She has this ability to like,
I guess they put like a ball and then

7
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:23,050
attach a string to a ball at the end of
the string is a weight and she puts that

8
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:27,130
ball inside of her pussy and just locks
down on that motherfucker and then can

9
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:29,680
literally lift up like 70 pounds of
weight.

10
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,000
It's impressive.
I've been,

11
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:32,170
I've,
I've stood,

12
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:37,230
I've stood at one end of a strip club
and had a,

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,440
the in Bangkok had a tie stripper fire
dots from the other side of the room out

14
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:46,360
of her pussy and pop a balloon that I
was holding up in my head.

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,810
Wow.
And she was,

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,120
she could fire those things with such
aim.

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,120
I don't know why I was so stupid because
I could have gotten to taking an eye

18
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,430
out,
but what kind of speed of his lame at

19
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,850
speed speed.
Like a what?

20
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:04,090
She must've been a good 10 meters,
so maybe 30 feet away from me.

21
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,280
Oh my God.
She's firing him across the room fast

22
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:08,300
enough to be able to pop a balloon with
accuracy,

23
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,820
with accuracy.
That's insane.

24
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:10,810
Now,
how's she doing this?

25
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:14,560
And she had like her elbows to the back
of her knees and she's got her like her

26
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:15,880
pussy up in the air.
No,

27
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:17,950
she was standing up.
I'm trying to picture exactly what

28
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:19,660
position she was in jail.
She was sort of kneel,

29
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,510
kneeling and like standing.
Kneeling.

30
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,201
Oh wait,
no,

31
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:23,800
sorry.
Not,

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,260
not kneeling.
Bent knees bent.

33
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:28,660
Standing Upright and with a thrust of
the hips,

34
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,100
boy shooting it out.

35
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,120
What bent knees standing up are facing
you facing me.

36
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,580
Wow.
That's crazy.

37
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:39,790
That doesn't even seem like this.
That's like shooting a gun in the air

38
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,190
when you're pointing it at the ground.
It doesn't even make any sense.

39
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,730
How did she do that?
She might've had a hands on the ground.

40
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:47,951
To be honest,
Joe.

41
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:49,450
I wasn't focused on her fucking
position.

42
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:50,950
I was focused on whether or not she was
going to take my,

43
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:52,720
I had my eyes closed most of the time.
Well,

44
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:54,760
she had her hands on the ground now it
makes perfect sense.

45
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:57,760
So she's like a table table sitting
upright.

46
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,430
Yeah.
How's she getting the air til launch

47
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:03,610
that thing?
That's what's confusing about that.

48
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,670
It was so many things that she was doing
like that.

49
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,280
They have all kinds of tricks.
They had all kinds of stuff.

50
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,450
They were pink.
Started that with ping pong balls,

51
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:11,500
you know,
all the classic things.

52
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,580
Also razorblades Oh,
it's not pleasant.

53
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,180
It's an amazing what people will do if
you're confronted with a town filled

54
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,120
with drunk tourists who have already
seen everything.

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,980
They've seen Moy Thai kickboxing fights
where 16 year old kid's a fucking

56
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,230
shinned each other in the head until
they go unconscious.

57
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,530
They've seen legalized prostitution
everywhere.

58
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,530
Ladyboys everywhere.
Everything is chaos.

59
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,130
Just fucking scooters with 37 people
piled on him.

60
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,570
And what do they gotta do?
They they,

61
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,410
they have to adapt.
What's def?

62
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,580
It's evolution.
It's adapt or die.

63
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,170
You know,
you have to adapt.

64
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:50,570
You have to figure out how to,
how to,

65
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,100
how to stand out.
Well,

66
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:53,420
you got to shoot a dart out of your
pussy,

67
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:54,950
honey.
That Josh sips his head.

68
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:55,880
Yeah.
There's,

69
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,541
I mean,
you want,

70
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,940
you want to make the argument that
people are,

71
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,960
that's,
that's like one of the best arguments.

72
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:02,640
I look at that.

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,900
That's not to mention like,
I mean,

74
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,330
I've been to shows there where they're
just,

75
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,680
I remember the finale to one show where
it was like a bear about how 25

76
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,740
I may do my background,
my religion.

77
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:18,130
I mean,
this shit that we have done is,

78
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,080
it just,
it's like everything that they're saying

79
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:22,300
that every Muslim is doing right now,
it's like,

80
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,400
well,
we've done that in spades and it didn't,

81
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:30,401
it wasn't a couple of extremists.
It was the leaders of the religion,

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,320
you know,
Crusades,

83
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:34,630
the inquisition,
the fucking pedophilia.

84
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,180
It dude,
they were in bed with the Nazis.

85
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,111
Yeah.
You know,

86
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,030
when Jews went to find like where the
hell it all,

87
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:42,070
I would have took my riding lawnmower or
whatever.

88
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,220
They went up at the fucking Vatican.
Like some of this shit was there now.

89
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:46,501
Oh,
oh,

90
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:47,860
is that what those,
yours,

91
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,600
sorry.
Yeah,

92
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,800
they were on both sides.

93
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,850
They were just like,
listen,

94
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,500
I don't know how this is going to shake
out.

95
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,990
You know a lot of people in Europe who
like that,

96
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,490
they've always done that.
You know there's,

97
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,070
there's a Dang cars the Germans make,
you know,

98
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:01,240
you've got to think they're going to
win.

99
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,660
I thought enough of them,
it's just too small and island are too

100
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,450
small a country.
It was a big country like the United

101
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,760
States and they made shit like that.
It'd be pretty,

102
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:13,180
one of my favorite quotes from a German
general was said,

103
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:17,440
one tiger tank was worth four American
Sherman tanks,

104
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,770
but the Americans always had five.
That's a great quote.

105
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,540
That's what it was.
It was fucking Mcdonald's.

106
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:27,370
We were just cranking them out like
fucking quarter pounders with chase and

107
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,410
his crazy.
When you think about the fact like Audi,

108
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:31,450
Mercedes,
BMW,

109
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,200
like BMW used to make jet engines and
that technology was in their tax dude.

110
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,560
When I was,
I mean this shit I've been reading is

111
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:42,100
like when American soldiers killed
somebody German,

112
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:45,220
they dropped the American gun and picked
up the German feeling.

113
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:47,260
Yeah.
Like are are machine guns I guess

114
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,890
overheated or there's,
I don't know.

115
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,740
You know,
come on man.

116
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:52,750
You like car nearing,
you know how it is.

117
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,280
I mean we've got,
we got the corvette,

118
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:57,910
we got a couple,
but most of them are kind of a Monte

119
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,171
Carlo.
Yeah,

120
00:04:58,171 --> 00:05:01,120
we have like old muscle cars.
What I like is,

121
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,150
I like the old muscle cars cause the way
they look and the way they sound,

122
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,310
but the way they drive could be if you
took like a,

123
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,510
uh,
1980s porsche or a unit seven,

124
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,340
he's going to look in 1973 porsche like
a 1973,

125
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:13,150
nine,
11.

126
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,250
These the candle.
Pretty fucking good.

127
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,080
Pretty God damn good.
I mean,

128
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,360
not like a new car,
but pretty good.

129
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,510
The American,
what the American excuses is,

130
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:25,360
we had all this land so we could have
straight roads.

131
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:28,840
What they had over there do.
Those were like the original cow paths

132
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:32,830
when they will bring in fucking
revisions to town and then they just

133
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:35,140
paved over and basically and then all of
a sudden,

134
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,320
how do we go 200 miles an hour on this?
That's why you know Formula One has

135
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:41,530
right and left turns best we'll do is
just drive in a circle over here.

136
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,940
I love it,
dude.

137
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:46,690
I love that.
The more I travel,

138
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,330
the funnier we are.
Like we're fucking loud.

139
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,620
We got a lot of shit but were not bad.
They try to make us seem like we're bad,

140
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,820
but we're not.
But it's just,

141
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,800
we just are a product of where we're
from.

142
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,680
And who's kidding who,
man?

143
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:01,010
It's,
is it any more fun than just stomping on

144
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:03,530
the gas?
I called up 200 miles an hour to

145
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,330
straight line.
Well,

146
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,890
fine.
Get that Bentley 1929 Bentley.

147
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,610
God.
Well wait till you get towards newer

148
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,870
shit.
Look at that mercy.

149
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,340
Hold on.
Backups that Mercedes.

150
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:16,790
Look at that thing.
19 Whoa,

151
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,470
look at that.
It's amazing.

152
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,680
1930 count count.
Trossy oh,

153
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,990
that's the sound of the engine.
Yeah.

154
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,040
Oh,
you click on it,

155
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,940
you get the salary.
And this is why their tanks were better

156
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:27,770
than ours.
Look how pretty that are shit.

157
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:28,730
1930s.
It's like,

158
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:29,564
Oh God.

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh God.
How the fuck did you get started in this

160
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:40,370
business?
You seem like a fairly normal person.

161
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,590
Granted I've only met you for a very
short amount of time,

162
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,150
but you seem completely normal.

163
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,783
Uh,
it's,

164
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,340
it's a really good story.
Um,

165
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,300
I was 17 years old at the time and uh,
I was traveling abroad,

166
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:55,470
I was actually exchange student in Japan
and I was really lonely.

167
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:58,350
Like I stayed with a host family and I
didn't know any Japanese and I know you

168
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,890
and I spoke English and so I was online
just all the time,

169
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:03,810
like you know,
on,

170
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:05,970
on,
I mean this is kind of before my space

171
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:09,120
or facebook or anything like that,
but I'd go to different like social

172
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:12,130
networking sites and talk to people.
And um,

173
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,900
one day this guy starts talking to me
and he's a total pervert.

174
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:19,050
He,
he's like into a getting peed on and he

175
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:21,000
really has a thing for like panty hose
and,

176
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,930
and so he strikes up a conversation with
me cause he just thinks I'm very

177
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:29,340
attractive and all this and I was kind
of like grossed out by them,

178
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:31,350
but it intrigued at the same time,
you know?

179
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,340
And so I was like,
okay,

180
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,970
I'm talking to a guy online,
you can't do anything to me.

181
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:40,971
So I kept the lines of communication
open and we'd talk here and there and,

182
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,210
and he always tried to,
um,

183
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,350
convince me to meet him.
He really wanted me to piano and stuff

184
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:48,030
like that.
And I was like,

185
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:49,020
no,
not going to do that.

186
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:52,050
Am I going to do that?
I kept turning him down and then,

187
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:53,550
uh,
one day he was like,

188
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,140
all right,
like I get it,

189
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,510
you're not going to meet me,
but I just,

190
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,520
I think your pitch should be bottled and
sold.

191
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,950
It was like,
I was like,

192
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:04,380
all right by it then.
Like I didn't think he was serious.

193
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:05,940
I was like,
guy's full of shit.

194
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:07,800
But I was like,
fine by it.

195
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,150
And a,
and he did,

196
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:11,940
he bought a 12 ounce bottle just like
this,

197
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,970
um,
of my yearn for $250.

198
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,480
And after that I specify the ounces than
it had to been.

199
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,870
Uh,
I don't think so.

200
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:22,610
No,
I think we were just a bottle.

201
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,930
That's what we said.
Just a bottle.

202
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:24,764
Yeah.
Right.

203
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,140
And um,
yeah,

204
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:28,310
from there I was like,
oh,

205
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:32,900
there has to be more guys like this.
Like this guy found me on accident.

206
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,300
Like this is just a mistake.
Like what,

207
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:36,200
what happened if I went looking for guys
like this,

208
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,210
I'll give you promoted it.
Yeah.

209
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:40,380
Or like kind of sought it out.
And uh,

210
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,451
so I was like,
okay,

211
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:44,780
I've heard of like women selling their
use panties before.

212
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:46,400
I know that's a thing.
Um,

213
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,270
and so I started searching to see if
there was like a website that like I

214
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:52,430
could be on or something that catered to
that.

215
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,450
And a,
and I did,

216
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,310
I found this auction that's just like
Ebay,

217
00:08:56,311 --> 00:09:00,840
but it specializes and like use panties
or socks or panty hose or anything like

218
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,750
a woman can wear,
can auction on the site.

219
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,580
And a,
so I was like,

220
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,180
oh,
this,

221
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,730
yeah,
this is,

222
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,890
uh,
I'm doing this,

223
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,260
and I just started selling all sorts of
stuff.

224
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,110
[inaudible].
