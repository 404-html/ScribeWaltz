1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,860
Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,310
so it's an issue.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,600
I would,

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,770
I would encourage people,

5
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:09,880
especially maybe people that are prone
to cancer or people who have had cancer

6
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:13,570
in the past and maybe had treated and
are kind of in a state of remission.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,560
Uh,

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,400
if you go,

9
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:17,380
if you get your body into that,

10
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,130
what we call the metabolic zone where
the level of ketones are higher than the

11
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:25,630
level of glucose that puts tremendous
metabolic stress on cancer cells or

12
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:29,770
precancerous cells that have
a huge appetite for glucose.

13
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,410
So and that contribute can,

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,630
can initiate autophagy.

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,220
So even people who do not have cancer
perhaps don't want to just make sure

16
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,620
they're holding off of it as
a preventative maintenance.

17
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,160
Yup.

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,160
And I think it can stimulate almost
purge your body of cancer cells that are

19
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:52,960
weakened by in this fasted state and also
precancerous cells that may be in the

20
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,220
transition of trends.

21
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:54,890
You know,

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,460
differentiating into this no cancer cells.

23
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,740
These cells are very energy demanding,

24
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:01,090
especially if they're replicating.

25
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,120
And if you deprive them of energy,

26
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:08,740
the quote unquote energy crisis
signal that these cells receive can,

27
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,770
can initiate a program cell death
we call Apap ptosis and autophagy.

28
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,510
And that's the benefit of this.

29
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:17,770
It's almost like housekeeping.

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,670
So think about it,

31
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:18,821
you know,

32
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:23,070
you accumulate a lot of dead cells that
are kind of sluggish or mitochondria

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,711
kind of sluggish,

34
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:26,050
and then you fast for a
week and it's like reboot.

35
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,310
It's like a setting.

36
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:28,420
It's like a reset button.

37
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,593
Wow.

38
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,883
Wow.

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,330
Another one was a Norwegian man,

40
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,793
um,

41
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,550
has spent 40 years amassing of,

42
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,870
of a valuable stamp collection
on his bespoke porn film.

43
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:45,771
Was descent.

44
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:50,771
His stamp collection to the valley with
three naked porn women would destroy his

45
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:54,500
stamp collection.

46
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,291
Yeah.

47
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:56,680
Yes.

48
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:56,991
There you go.

49
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,040
That's a still from it.

50
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm A.

51
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,650
Yeah.

52
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,480
How much does the stamp collection worth?

53
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:02,950
Well,

54
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,783
live?

55
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:04,790
Well,

56
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,190
it turns out because we
managed to track down stamps,

57
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:08,000
man.

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,420
And he talked to us after
a lot of persuasion.

59
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,680
Uh,

60
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,810
and he's got 10 books of stamps.

61
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,291
Um,

62
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:19,160
once a year he sends one
to accustom producer.

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,593
And so does it.

64
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,160
So that's his thing.

65
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,491
Yeah,

66
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:27,200
it turns out it's because he grew up
in Iceland where stamp collecting was a

67
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,770
popular hobby at the time in like
the seventies and the eighties.

68
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,960
A stamp collecting was big.

69
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,153
So,

70
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,700
uh,

71
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,710
he became like an
obsessive stamp collector.

72
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:38,150
The stamps shop owners would say,

73
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:38,271
Oh,

74
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:39,870
if you buy the standards
can be Bay valley,

75
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:40,940
but in 20 years,

76
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,400
but then came the internet
and it killed off the stump.

77
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,100
Is it killed off stamp
collecting as a hobby light?

78
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,010
Yeah,

79
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,520
nerds apparently felt like over
other things to be interested in.

80
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,350
And you know,

81
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,810
the thrill of the chase
just wasn't there anymore.

82
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,690
Like you can easily pack.

83
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,200
Yeah.

84
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,980
So anyway,

85
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,830
so his stamps lost all their value.

86
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,020
The stamp stores closed down,

87
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,100
that kind of collegial atmosphere of
fellow stamp collectors just vanished.

88
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,080
He began to like,

89
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,391
you know,

90
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:12,790
regret his life choices of like spending
all that time and money collecting

91
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,510
stamps.

92
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,190
He began to feel depressed and isolated.

93
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,260
So he went to see a psychiatrist who
told them that stamp collecting is a

94
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,880
ridiculous hobby

95
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,150
because it isolates him.

96
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,140
So now he pays porn people
to destroy his stamps.

97
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,180
The psychiatrist told them that a
hobby is ridiculous according to him,

98
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,220
and I never talked to the psychiatrist,

99
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,241
but according to him,

100
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:37,451
yeah,

101
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,350
he said that stamp
collecting is ridiculous.

102
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:40,020
Hobby

103
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,600
seems like a ridiculous thing
for a psychologist to say.

104
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,200
Sounds bad.

105
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,300
Psychologist enjoys it.

106
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:46,750
Yeah.

107
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,290
If you're,

108
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,640
if you have all your ducks in a row and
everything's firing on all cylinders,

109
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,560
but you really truly enjoy stamps.

110
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,753
Who's,

111
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,040
who's to tell you there's
something wrong with that?

112
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,461
Well,

113
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:57,800
the only.

114
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,110
I mean,

115
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,950
one good thing that came out of it was,

116
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:00,784
um,

117
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,650
he really enriched the imaginations of
the people in the valley and also my

118
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:07,961
imagination too.

119
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:08,794
I mean stamps.

120
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,270
But one of the things that I used to
see early on that was so confusing to me

121
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:17,080
because I came from a striking background
was how many of these guys were

122
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:21,820
willing to beat the fuck out of each
other in the gym and like that there were

123
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:26,821
just going to war but not even
going to war with like good skills,

124
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,920
like going to war while there
were learning for the sake of war.

125
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,311
Yeah.

126
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:30,631
But I mean,

127
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:33,460
I mean I'm watching them getting
coached and they're beating the shit.

128
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:33,701
I'm like,

129
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:35,530
you guys are professionals.

130
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,910
Like this isn't like,

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,070
this isn't like some idiots at the y.

132
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:39,690
uh,

133
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,523
you guys are,

134
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,810
you're supposed to be pros
like you can damage yourself.

135
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,940
The van take years off of your career.

136
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,940
The vast majority of me working
with athletes is doing these very,

137
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,720
very basic things.

138
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,590
Like I'm not,

139
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,401
I'm asking not.

140
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:55,180
The Guru was like,

141
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,331
oh,

142
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:56,060
I know the,

143
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,360
the 18 point blood tests and
we're going to get these.

144
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,340
The vast majority of what I do is go,

145
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,241
oh,

146
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:01,481
okay.

147
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,314
I see the problem here.

148
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,010
Oh,

149
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,540
we need to do this basic thing.

150
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,553
Right?

151
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,880
You haven't eaten a vegetable in a week.

152
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,610
Got It.

153
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,060
Like that as not as much anymore.

154
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,230
But I used to really?

155
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:11,890
Yeah.

156
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,730
We get a lot of the pro athlete
that doesn't eat vegetables.

157
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,640
We get is honestly,

158
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:18,280
it's because probably because assholes
like you and they want your show or

159
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:19,114
something.

160
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,810
I tell people to eat
vegetables all the time.

161
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,240
No they weren't.

162
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,150
They watched this and then like,

163
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:23,391
okay,

164
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:26,990
and I'll come at me with a thousand
really weird nutrition questions or

165
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,351
something,

166
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,780
a really weird advanced training ones
because they went to a seminar or

167
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:30,531
something and I'm like,

168
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,470
back the train up like you're
sparring six times a week.

169
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,770
We've got a whole nother
conversation like,

170
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:36,891
oh,

171
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:37,890
we don't do that now.

172
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:38,540
That's not normal.

173
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,470
Really know,

174
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,363
okay,

175
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,890
or you're doing that or you're
running 35 miles a week.

176
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,383
Got It.

177
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,410
That's the vast majority of what I do is,

178
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:48,350
is bring these guys back
to life and go like,

179
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,310
let me help you sift through all this
internet stuff that's really complicated

180
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,140
and let's take what's actually good
and bad and dial in a very usable.

181
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,190
So I think

182
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,680
people just get overwhelmed
with options for me.

183
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,041
Internet.

184
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:01,874
Absolutely.

185
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,070
Because too many people get on exposure
again on shows or platforms and they try

186
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:07,750
to make sure that,

187
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,340
that they are known as the guy
that knows something different.

188
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,323
Right,

189
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,841
right,

190
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:12,200
right.

191
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,290
Well,

192
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,890
it's like it's not very excited if
I come up here and tell you like,

193
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,050
oh,

194
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,320
Joel has pros and cons to everything.

195
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:16,910
Great.

196
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,061
Like,

197
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:17,894
well that's not fun.

198
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,401
Boom.

199
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:20,234
And we're live.

200
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:20,830
Dude.

201
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,441
You survive.

202
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,170
What's up buddy?

203
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,003
Alright,

204
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,220
he survived the Joey Diaz experience.

205
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,591
You know,

206
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:27,120
I got gotta I got a um,

207
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,120
I got uh,

208
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,760
a text from Tom.

209
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,663
Tom.

210
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:31,681
Tom,

211
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:32,060
right?

212
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,570
Yeah.

213
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,810
I said because he asked me,

214
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:37,110
we were backstage about to go onstage
at the main room and he's like,

215
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,670
I want you to do my podcast,

216
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:39,390
blah blah blah.

217
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,350
And I'm like awesome.

218
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,180
And then we were texting just about
my schedule with him and then he's.

219
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,811
And then I'm like,

220
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:46,141
okay,

221
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:48,120
I'm going to go see Joey Diaz de da.

222
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,571
And he's like,

223
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:49,051
dude,

224
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:50,130
fucking gummy bears.

225
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:50,964
Watch out.

226
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:51,691
And I'm like,

227
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:52,501
what are you talking about?

228
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:53,010
I didn't like,

229
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,730
I didn't understand what
he was talking about.

230
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,760
Like I didn't,

231
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,371
you know what I mean?

232
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:56,701
I didn't,

233
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:58,020
I honestly didn't like,

234
00:06:58,021 --> 00:06:58,351
I was like,

235
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:58,741
whatever,

236
00:06:58,741 --> 00:06:59,580
I don't what you're talking about.

237
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,200
And then once I got there,

238
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,741
you know,

239
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:03,210
I smoke weed sometimes,

240
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,451
you know,

241
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:06,740
I don't smoke all the time but
I like to smoke weed sometimes,

242
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,170
but the.

243
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,700
But as far as the edibles,

244
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,500
I like Dean Gelber.

245
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,560
It's given me some pot stuff
but like cookies and shit,

246
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,340
but then like he was eating
these gummy bears and they in,

247
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,510
in a bag and I was like,

248
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:18,901
going,

249
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:19,351
fuck,

250
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:19,801
okay.

251
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:20,930
And he gave me just like,

252
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:21,764
uh,

253
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,950
he gave me just like an ear
or some shit and that was it.

254
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,610
And then I was just like talking to them
and then like literally I couldn't talk

255
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:30,444
anymore.

256
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,110
I couldn't talk part
of it it a half a one,

257
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,330
Scott had to leave.

258
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,560
He's got some that are
like 500 milligrams,

259
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,930
which is just insane.

260
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,060
So you probably had half of that,

261
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:45,350
which is like 250,

262
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:46,760
which is fucking insane.

263
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,530
That's an insane amount of weed.

264
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,513
But unless you're an okay,

265
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:49,830
gee,

266
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,981
yeah,

267
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:50,260
I,

268
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,060
but I had done mushrooms once before
when I was younger and it felt like that.

269
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,430
Yeah.

270
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,263
Well that's,

271
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,770
Oh,

272
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,210
to the risk of repeating
myself over and over again,

273
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:01,140
which I do all the time,

274
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:03,480
but when you eat marijuana,

275
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,800
it's processed by your liver and it
produces something called 11 hydroxy

276
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:08,634
metabolite.

277
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,130
It's a totally different
psychoactive substance sets,

278
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,280
four to five times more
psychoactive than thc.

279
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,900
So that's why it hits you like that and
that's why people think they got dosed

280
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,210
because when you smoke pot that the,

281
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,460
it's not psychoactive,

282
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,630
but when you eat it,

283
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:27,420
it's processed by your liver
and something called a one pass.

284
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,140
And uh,

285
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,340
that's how it produces that.

286
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:29,591
Yeah.

287
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,390
And I can't believe he let me drive home.

288
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,531
Like,

289
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:33,364
seriously.

290
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,500
I mean I could like.

291
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,280
Because when I was
driving home I was like,

292
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:36,491
dude,

293
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:37,181
I got to go.

294
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:37,391
Like,

295
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:37,901
I stopped,

296
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:38,110
I go,

297
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,460
I can't answer your questions.

298
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,480
And then I said let's,

299
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
I have to go.

300
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,540
And I left and I drove out and he like,

301
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,440
he let me drive,

302
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,790
like you can understand,

303
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,060
understand Joey Diaz found his mother
dead on the kitchen floor when he was on

304
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,590
acid when he was 13.

305
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,410
He would let you fly a
fucking plane on those things.

306
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:54,400
He doesn't give a shit.

307
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,411
He's just like,

308
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,060
you'll forget about

309
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,893
cock sucker

310
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,330
anyways.

311
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,560
So when did it hit you?

312
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:02,730
Like he did a podcast,

313
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:03,420
like how,

314
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,480
how different do I have?

315
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,070
Fifteen minutes into it
and I couldn't speak.

316
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,120
I had to stop.

317
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,400
I couldn't speak.

318
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,140
So you haven't released the podcast?

319
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,581
I don't know.

320
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:15,630
I think he did the audio,

321
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:16,470
but not the video.

322
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:16,950
Oh,

323
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,270
I told him not to do the video.

324
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,880
I couldn't answer any questions.

325
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,340
Yeah,

326
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,360
but wouldn't that be funny?

327
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:22,461
Yeah,

328
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:22,981
I guess.

329
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:23,814
I don't know.

330
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,240
I'd like to see myself that
fucked up where I can't even talk.
