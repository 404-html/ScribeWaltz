1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,920
The joe rogan experience. Hey,
did you see tiger yesterday? Dude,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,650
I was watching it while
we were in Georgia.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,240
We were in Georgia for the UFC and I had
a comedy show out there and we were me

4
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:15,980
and um, Santino or watching
it on the screen. Ah,

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,070
on Saturday or yesterday. We watched
it Friday or was it Friday or Saturday?

6
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:23,470
Saturday. So Friday, Saturday. Then anyone
yesterday. Well, whatever days it was,

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,200
right.
I think we watched it two days in a row.

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,790
It was in the gym every day we were there,

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,510
but then I got home and I saw it
on my phone. I was like, Holy Shit.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,340
I don't even give a fuck about golf. I
know I'm going to speak. How powerful.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,090
I made a comeback, a huge comeback
that, I mean, that's amazing.

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,450
Seven years later,
oh my God,

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,610
somebody's put on Instagram.
One of my quotes. Oh yeah,

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,380
that I attached to that.

15
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:54,180
It was pretty cool that I
love a guy get look, I love,

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,770
what did I say? I love a success story,
but even more than that, I love a guy,

17
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:02,760
fucks his life up and then gets it back
together again. Story. It's the greatest,

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,870
it's the greatest good.
It must feel to that guy.

19
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:10,770
It's kind on top of the world again. And
then he like, yeah, it was so messed up.

20
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:15,330
And then the back problems and troubles
and the kids and the wife and the thing

21
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:19,140
and it just 11 years. Yup.
And he didn't stop working.

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,950
He just went to work and went to work
and went to where? He's 11 years later.

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,240
And so he went on major championship
recently. Right. Did anyone win one?

24
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:30,290
It was a big deal. He won a major
championship within the last,

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,900
it wasn't a manager, but it was, it wasn't
a major this, this was the first major.

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,660
He's one in 11 years. Okay. So
the other one wasn't a major,

27
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:39,930
but it was a big event. It
was a big tournament. He wins
that whenever I was like,

28
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:44,580
wow, he might be back. He can, he can
fucking win big tournament's again.

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,010
And then he just, Oh,
it was so cool to see.

30
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:51,720
The crowd just kept building over the
weekend and by yesterday it was massive.

31
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,430
Thousands of people around the
green just hanging on him. Oh,

32
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:59,820
the relief that you saw just
coming out of him. It was so great.

33
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:00,541
And then at the end,

34
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:04,890
like he walks off where as a kid he was
only like 21 when he were on the first

35
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,620
time hugging his dad at the edge.

36
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,350
And now he comes off 11
years later all this time.

37
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,310
And His dad's passed and he's
hugging his child, his son.

38
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,630
Now he's the father in the
same spot. Oh, it was just,

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,500
I was trying not to cry the whole time.
Maybe.

40
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,100
Or there's guys or the guys like Louis
C K who's selling out everywhere and

41
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:28,080
doing great comedy.
Like he can't,

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,110
he could sell out fucking staple center
right now, multiple times in a row.

43
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,240
What's crazy is he doesn't want to,
doesn't want to,

44
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:36,600
it's just too in comedy
clubs just working. Yeah.

45
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,480
He could easily come back like
tiger woods easily right now.

46
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,010
He said something so fucked up too because
they asked me why I did it. He goes,

47
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:49,660
I like to jerk off and I
don't want to be alone.

48
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,230
I like to jerk off and I don't like to
be alone. Like, oh, and then you know

49
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,010
he's man. Yeah. I mean

50
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,400
he also, he did some creepy shit, but
definitely did, did some creepy shit.

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,950
I don't approve of it,
but he didn't molest anyone.

52
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,020
I don't think we know exactly
what happened either. I don't,

53
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,760
I can't say too much because I don't know,

54
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,220
but I think he did some regrettable
things and I think he would admit that,

55
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:22,090
but I don't think he did what a lot of
people are claiming he did in terms of,

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,020
that's what I've heard,

57
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,830
how often he did it or who he did
or what the circumstances were,

58
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,120
but it was either way.
There's no defending when it
was bad. No, it's not good.

59
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,090
There's no difference.
It's a terrible thing to do,

60
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,930
but what's the punishment for that?
You know,

61
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:41,650
how much I should punish or did he
not pay for it? He lost all his jobs,

62
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,520
lost all his TV deals,
$35 million in a year of work.

63
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,550
And people still were saying
no, but he's still, he's fine.

64
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:53,380
I've heard that argument that he's
fine. Like what? These are also,

65
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:56,950
these are also things that he did like
more than a decade ago. Right. What,

66
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,610
when do you offer someone compassion?
Like when do you,

67
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,280
when do you let some explain themselves?
When do you,

68
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:06,370
when is it enough is enough for,
should he have to do something?

69
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,130
Like what would people like someone to do?

70
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,910
Well I think they're coming because
there's only a year and that he's back and

71
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:16,390
killing it because he's so good at comedy.
Cause like with tiger was right,

72
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:18,250
people hated tiger.
Well there was that,

73
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:21,760
but there was also the material
that got leaked when he came back.

74
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,690
So people were upset at the jokes.
The parkland joke. Yeah. Not the best.

75
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,530
That shit falls in line with how
he's always done jokes though.

76
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,970
I tell him whether he did this or not.
He says the fucked up thing to say.

77
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:37,690
It's part of what makes him really funny.
And he does that in real life too.

78
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,750
It's not,
it's a style of comedy man.

79
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,980
I mean it's just like a Quentin
Tarantino has a style of making movies.

80
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,430
His style of comedy is
to say fucked up thing.

81
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:50,200
So that compounded the fact that people
were upset at him that a year ago,

82
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,790
you know, he said he was going to take
some time off and it's, um, I don't,

83
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,091
you know,

84
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:59,540
I think it's really important to know
that I don't know what happened and,

85
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,420
and you know,
he knows and they know and it's,

86
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,450
it's never good when someone's upset
that you jerked off in front of them.

87
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,051
That depth.

88
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:13,051
[inaudible] which is never good for
anybody but also him losing $35 million in

89
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:16,810
only being out a year. I think people are
set. That was such a quick turnaround.

90
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,920
Like if we're food Tj, is that a quick
turnaround man? I mean, not as a comic,

91
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,000
but for, to the, to the uh, normal
person like a year. That ain't shit dude.

92
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,610
My natural links in,
you know,

93
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,480
if you're getting interviewed and
some fucking idiot comes here in,

94
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,020
cuts your any rear off. Oh, you should
get punched or slapped upside your head.

95
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:36,660
You know, that'll teach you respect
not to do it and nobody else again,

96
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,500
I should immediately done it, but I
didn't. I answered his question politely.

97
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,940
Maybe. Maybe now he goes on to say,
shut up after that. I can't take that.

98
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,950
My daughter might be
watching this interview.

99
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,400
I'm been telling her stand up
to bullies your whole life.

100
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,040
Don't go running into somebody and tell
them the song. So it was picking on me.

101
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,930
Handle it yourself.
That's what's wrong with this country.

102
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,620
I think with this whole, somebody
picks on you. Go tell somebody else.

103
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,500
I'm not going to tell authorities
this hooligan speaking on me.

104
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:03,080
I'm going to handle it myself, you know,
because I'm going to see him again.

105
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:05,930
He's going to think he could pick on me.
Gotta handle it myself.

106
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,600
You know I'm in my interview,
man. You're gonna steal my moment.

107
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,790
I just worked out here.
Just kicked some butt out here.

108
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,970
You barely want to split
decision in your own country.

109
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,450
I knocked this dude out and you're
trying to steal my shine like this.

110
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,540
That's what I'm saying. And then he
got famous off though, which I hate.

111
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,270
So only thing I could take
back about that night,

112
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,720
that it wasn't filmed that and filmed
it, it'd be even better. You know,

113
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,500
he was just gone off and sign this,
you know neon got his ass.

114
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,080
I think it helped you too. Did it help me?
Yeah, but helped him more than anything.

115
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,020
It helps people know who the school
dollars. Mazda DOL doesn't take any shit.

116
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,130
People have known that since
before rainbows had color.

117
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:45,230
They already knew that they didn't,

118
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,100
they didn't need to see you open this
to the lingo that they like to see it.

119
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,910
They'd like to get remembered, Huh? Yeah.

120
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,190
They like to see people
have consequences for shit.

121
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:58,790
Talking in this weird era of
constant shit talking, you know,

122
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,930
I think people enjoy it. They like
it. And if you guys ever fight,

123
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,700
but makes it a bigger fight for sure.

124
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,250
I guess you know me guess but
does that like I beat number city.

125
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,950
I've been in this sport for a while.
I've been beating up guys.

126
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,550
Would that validate them to fight anyone?
He has a beat in a top 10 guy.

127
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,150
You still yet to be the top thing guy,
you know like,

128
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:23,890
but he could get that fight off that that
that's the new age and era they, right,

129
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,990
right. That's a concern. That's a concern.

130
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,950
I'll fuck when when his,
when he's beating in a top Tim Guy,

131
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,700
I'm going to be the first guy
to expose him to break his face,

132
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,520
but until that moment comes you're,

133
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:39,020
you're talking about the business side
because you already saw on the personal

134
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:42,830
side any day of the week I will
address you, but on the business side,

135
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,480
get to my level buddy, put in the
fucking world. Go beat a top 10 guy,

136
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,100
knock him the fuck out.

137
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,160
Did you talk at all about getting in
trouble for punching someone in another

138
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:55,790
country? I was scared out of my fucking
life, Joe. That's what I'm thinking.

139
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,430
I was scared of. I thought this
guy was going to kill me, man.

140
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,450
I might've not looked it, but I was
scared of, of my life. Yeah, I get it.

141
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:06,350
I'm very cold blooded. You know,
I get that from, from genetics,

142
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:08,750
from my pops in them.
But I was scared out of my mind.

143
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,710
I thought this guy was going to
take everything I had. You know,

144
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,430
you had to do that. I had to
defend my side. I understand,

145
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,450
but did you worry at all about them
arresting you or any weird shit like that

146
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:20,870
over there at me? You're in another
corner to press charges. Ah, I,

147
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:21,800
that's how scared I was.

148
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,730
But I'm not gonna pitch charges
because I understand how my man, yeah,

149
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,140
but that's how I felt.
I've you, you're in danger.

150
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,900
I was fucking hell of in
danger and we just do not see,

151
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:34,310
it was not just one assailant and he's
just him and his crew of hooligans,

152
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,790
hooligans, lawless people.
I had to defend myself.

153
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,560
I did everything in my
right to defend myself.

154
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:43,250
There's one against like three or four
dudes and they know it. It's on video.

155
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,040
There's no such thing as a perfectly
fair competition that will be designed by

156
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,180
God to be perfect and be perfectly fair.
Right?

157
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,290
We're always making choices about what
kind of competition we want to have and

158
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,190
what, who we want to allow
into and what sort of outcome

159
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,430
we want to have. You know what I'm
in, right? Just like in baseball,

160
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,320
too many home runs move
the mount up or down.

161
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:03,630
You know how they changed the rules a
little bit cause they want more home runs.

162
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,550
Same thing with same thing
with track and field.

163
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,910
We changed the rules a little bit to allow
this person and not allow this person.

164
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:10,890
Right. I think that when
we're talking about people,

165
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:13,950
we should always try to include
more people, not less. We should,

166
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,300
you know like if and if hey,

167
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,820
if you're a double amputee and you can
get your way into the Olympics and you

168
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:18,840
can make a plausible case,

169
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,570
I think we should try to entertain that
notion and we should try to find a way

170
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:25,500
to get that guy in there. Right. As
far as trans athletes go, you know,

171
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,250
we could have,

172
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,130
we could sit here and talk for three
hours about like all the different ways

173
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:31,410
that hormones might affect your body.
It might not affect your body.

174
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,720
And I'm not an expert on that and
I don't want to claim to be right.

175
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,080
But a sports with a
trans athletes who are,

176
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,430
uh, you know, competing with the, you
know, with their gender, right? That's,

177
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,430
uh, that is a sporting world that
I'm Morgan trusted in. Right.

178
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:49,500
And I think we should find
a way to make that happen.

179
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:53,730
I know it's gonna be really complicated,
complicated and messy, right? Um, and, uh,

180
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:55,720
there's gonna be a lot of debate about
it and there's going to make it can be

181
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,590
uncomfortable. You know, there's gonna
be a lot of arguments, but, you know,

182
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:01,140
I hope that that's the world that
we've moved forward to. That's my,

183
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,040
that's my point of view.

184
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,260
My point of view is that there's a reason,
there's a distinction.

185
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,820
There's a reason why we make the
distinction to have male athletics versus

186
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:15,360
female athletics. The reason is
that males have a physiological,

187
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,800
physiological advantage over women. So
in most sports, most physical sports,

188
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:22,260
we do not have males compete with females.

189
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,620
The question becomes when someone who
is male transitions and becomes female,

190
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,980
do those same physiological
advantages apply?

191
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,410
And what are the, what
is the evidence? Well,

192
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:38,100
the evidence and competition seems to
be that it shows that it does apply,

193
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:42,570
particularly in weightlifting,
rugby, mountain biking power,

194
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:46,590
heavy sports that are,
that favor larger people,

195
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,970
stronger bodies,

196
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,170
males that transition to females have
a significant advantage and they're

197
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:53,340
breaking world records.

198
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,560
So if you're a woman and you're a natural
woman and you don't take any extra

199
00:10:58,561 --> 00:10:59,730
hormones or male hormones,

200
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:02,640
you're not taking steroids or any
sort of performance enhancing drugs,

201
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,120
you're doing your very best to
compete in near the top of the heap.

202
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,160
But then someone comes along that was
a man for 30 years and decides that

203
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:14,910
they're going to be a woman and this has
happened and literally transition a few

204
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,290
months ago and compete as a woman and
destroys records and dominates you in that

205
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,000
sport.
That's bullshit.

206
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,750
And that's not competing
on a level playing field.

207
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,670
That's a person who is biologically a
male and who was a male for 30 plus years

208
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:32,790
of having testosterone run through their
body and affect their tendon strength

209
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,500
and affect the shape of their bones and
the mechanical advantages of the male

210
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:42,501
hips versus the female hips and then
they're competing with smaller people who

211
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:45,330
have been a woman their whole
life. It's not fair. It's,

212
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:50,331
it's is as much cheating as taking
steroids when the other person doesn't or

213
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:53,130
taking performance enhancing drugs
when the other person doesn't.

214
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,160
Maybe even more so

215
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,440
maybe in more so because you also have,

216
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,380
there's a bunch of advantages in terms
of reaction time that males enjoy.

217
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,350
It's like it's some significant difference
in reaction time between males and

218
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:09,010
even untrained males versus
female professional athletes.

219
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,310
But I see him out of beginning
of my guys call it career.

220
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,730
Like I used to not prepare at all.
I was still drinking and using.

221
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,470
I've got up on stage at trop shit up
again to confrontation like am when to say

222
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,660
truck shop. I'd take up animals, shit
part animal parts. I'd got from bookshare.

223
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,940
It's like, like a skull. We've all meat
and stuff and sinew on it. Chop it up.

224
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,650
Fry Nunes released locusts gain to
confrontation like so. Yeah, exactly.

225
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,600
The reaction you're having this
direction they were hacking.

226
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,780
Last I saw was the frame road.
I had like fights.

227
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:41,350
I've got scars on my body from bad
standup gigs from a time where I'd go to a

228
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:45,130
confrontation, like I was making a
point about pedophilia saying, oh,

229
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,450
we're all one cultural mind.

230
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,270
So when a particular P to file
is transgressed against a child,

231
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:53,030
we're all responsible. People are like,
what the fuck? I haven't messed up.

232
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,470
So I got the shit kicked out.
Well that time,

233
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,370
you know I've still got the scar
on my leg that happened there.

234
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:59,380
Ed and Brian Scotland.
People didn't take it well,

235
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,830
but what I was trying to do
was like create, I didn't
have the skills, the chops,

236
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,920
the experience than jokes.
So is so under equipped,

237
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,540
but like what I was trying to do was
create environments that felt you,

238
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,100
I'm much better at doing that now.

239
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:19,390
I can create that kind of an uncertainty
in a room or kind of a sense of chaos

240
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:20,830
and what's happening
and then bring it back.

241
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,210
I hope to a humorous conclusion where
people feel safe and amused and all of

242
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:28,990
that kind of stuff. Now I think it's, you
can like, cause I did cry and do that.

243
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:31,870
And comedy clubs and yeah, it was
confrontation. It's done what people want.

244
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,290
So don't you think that by
prepping your stand up in those.
