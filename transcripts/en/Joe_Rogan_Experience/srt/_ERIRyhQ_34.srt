1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,000
I was listening to some old timey music
the other day and it was making me think

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,480
of how depressing it would be if that
was the only music that you could hear.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,860
La La La la La la La David Lynch movie
that David Lynch in his movies,

4
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:19,530
he always has those,
those songs.

5
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:21,930
Like there's a woman dead in a hotel and
there's just this

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,923
oh

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,840
mansion.
The days where that Tuba with a needle

8
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:35,190
at the bottom of my grandfather had one
of those in my home in Pelham.

9
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:38,580
And his Colin Powell in New York,
they had an old chronic graft.

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,110
They,
it is called right phonograph and they

11
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:41,944
would play,
uh,

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,020
you know,
classical.

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,850
My grandparents never listened to.
They were Sicilian.

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,990
They never listened to music.
Did your parents or your grandparents

15
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:51,660
have the TV and a cabinet?
Ah Ha.

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,750
And they certainly did.
And then with the TV would die.

17
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:58,020
A lot of times folks who put the new TV
on top of the cabinet,

18
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:01,260
they would keep the tea,
the cabinet with the blown out TV.

19
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,311
Yeah,
dude,

20
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:03,690
everybody did that.
Well,

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,280
I had a family that never threw anything
away.

22
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,960
No my night.
Never ever.

23
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,150
I'm talking about road cones.
We got to my attic,

24
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:11,410
we find crazy.
She had her phone.

25
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,410
Yes.
Phonograph.

26
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,570
Not a chronic,
that's a chronograph,

27
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:17,060
but they always had a chronograph.
Oh,

28
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:17,701
watch.
Oh,

29
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:18,150
right,
right.

30
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

31
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,820
Cause I have a chronology,
goddammit.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,670
Yeah.
Those things were crazy.

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,530
Like that was how they used to listen to
music.

34
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:30,531
A Tuba attached to a needle bolts right
here and the speaker must have sounded

35
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:35,070
like dog shit.
My Dad used to have a dust cover for his

36
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,330
turntable and he would,
he had,

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,410
there was a ritual to how you clean your
Lp.

38
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,700
Oh,
there's a ritual.

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,620
You got to dust it off.
You have a special cloth and all the

40
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,463
shit thing.
Yup.

41
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,190
That's what we take a peek at that
fucker.

42
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,050
Look at that.
That's nuts.

43
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,650
I think for people at home,
it looks like it does a really traffic

44
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:53,820
cone.
Right?

45
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,501
It does.
Right.

46
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:57,660
Like a big old brass traffic.
A little needles.

47
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,680
I read the Ted Williams,
the great,

48
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,740
uh,
this might've been a myth,

49
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,750
but the great baseball player,
Ted Williams,

50
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,580
who could hit a fast ball,
hit any kind of ball,

51
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,030
and he apparently could read the label
of a record as it was going around.

52
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,320
His eyes could slow shit down.
Holy Shit.

53
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:15,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

54
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,430
I wonder if that's true.
I wonder.

55
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,150
Well,
yeah,

56
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,200
you know,
is this is one of those three things you

57
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,053
hear,
right?

58
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,740
Like Joe Frazier was in a hotel room.
There were four flies in the room there,

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,090
the way it was started with the flies
and he went and caught them all and he

60
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:27,541
goes,
here,

61
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:31,910
you flies the fuck out outta here.
Andy Griffin was telling us that Bruce

62
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,430
Lee's story once it was one of those,
yeah,

63
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:39,240
I heard he killed him.
Bruce Lee was in a fight with 30 men and

64
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:40,890
he stood in the center of all of them.
And you're like,

65
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,281
wait,
wait,

66
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:41,910
wait,
wait.

67
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,380
Where'd you hear this?
He never,

68
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:45,730
I heard he never wasn't harangue
already.

69
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,520
He would never,
he never sparred once.

70
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,760
I don't think Bruce Lee ever.
Did you ever fight competitive?

71
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:53,010
Was rumored.
No,

72
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:57,780
but he did one thing once where you
sparred at like this a karate festival.

73
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,290
One sparring session.
Cool.

74
00:02:59,291 --> 00:02:59,951
Yeah.
All right.

75
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:00,040
Well

76
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,481
good luck.
Yeah.

77
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:04,300
You could see good luck against the guys
to be able to read the label on the no.

78
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,150
Good luck to everybody against a guy
like Darren till that's luck.

79
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:08,000
Good luck.
I mean,

80
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,043
yeah.
Vinny,

81
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,830
vinny shoreman who is,
he does,

82
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:13,990
um,
a color commentary for a lot of big

83
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:15,010
Moitai events.
Yeah.

84
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,090
And super knowledgeable like as a
striker and he's also a hypnotist.

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,810
I got hypnotized by them a couple of
times.

86
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,940
I,
I kept my pants on,

87
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,560
but he got,
sorry.

88
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,570
Yeah,
you hypnotize me.

89
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,830
Fascinating.
V Hypnotism is feet.

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,130
You get hypnotized cause you're 100%
really?

91
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:30,880
Yeah.
Give into it.

92
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,750
Yeah.
Just let it,

93
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,550
let,
let yourself achieve the state.

94
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,470
But you realize what it is.
It's like,

95
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,870
Oh,
you've got this idea where like someone

96
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:41,680
can like turn you into Manchurian
candidate if they hypnotize you and you

97
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,910
wouldn't have to troll your brain
anymore.

98
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:43,810
No,
no,

99
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:43,961
no,
no.

100
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:45,070
You're relaxing.
Yeah.

101
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,400
You're relaxing and you're open to
suggestion in an interesting state of

102
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,980
mind that you can achieve.
Right?

103
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,260
See like I think just think there's a
larger spectrum of the way the mind

104
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,310
works then we give it credit for.
And I think what I've been thinking

105
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,040
about this a lot that that's one of the
things that happens with standup.

106
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,100
I think if you're onstage and you're
killing and stand up,

107
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,430
if I'm in the audience,
it's like you've got me hypnotized.

108
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,520
I'm locked up into your line of thinking
and like your act is a very silly,

109
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,000
so like when I'm watching you,
like I start thinking in silly ways and

110
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:22,300
then you'll keep getting sillier and
sillier and then like I'm locked into

111
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:25,180
your head.
It's like it's a form of hypnosis,

112
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,500
100% and I think that so is like being
in a good place.

113
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:29,981
Thank you.
Young.

114
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:32,650
Jamie said though.
So it'd be in a good place mentally.

115
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:34,780
So it was being in a bad place.
But I think there's like,

116
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,520
there's a large spectrum in the mind of
all these different chairs.

117
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:40,460
Where are you going fucker?
He can't.

118
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,460
What kind of staggered was fantastic.
Cheers dude.

119
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,950
It's all right.
It's a solid white on the juice guys,

120
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:49,720
gentlemen.
I like them because it's a good juice.

121
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,300
It's a good juice and those guys are
gross.

122
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,000
Hey you guys who say it's a good juice
and you're talking about wine.

123
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,570
It's a sexy juice stopped.
Honestly,

124
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:59,470
it's sexy.
Just kind of feels like talk to you.

125
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,150
It's like taking a big bite.
On one hand

126
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,220
it's like having a wet dog to great
juice shake itself out.

127
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,520
You have,
have you ever gone into like a real wine

128
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:10,810
tasting with a bunch of nerds?

129
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,190
Sure.
Have different cause.

130
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,033
Amazing.
Those nerves.

131
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,530
Nerves I ever got to a wine taste
tasting where you graded a wine and you

132
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:21,640
stood up and said it has woody after
tones and there's a s I was invited,

133
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,140
I was invited by a guy a long time ago,
20 years ago.

134
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,890
And he said,
um,

135
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,190
I'm going to invite you to a wine
tasting where we all bring our own

136
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:31,024
wines.
And he said,

137
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,863
he's a good guy.
Goes,

138
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,621
he said,
I said,

139
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:33,460
well,
what do I bring?

140
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:34,840
And he said,
I don't want to insult you,

141
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:37,450
but you can't afford the kind of wines
that we're bringing,

142
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:40,780
so I'm going to bring you a bottle from
my seller so it doesn't make you look.

143
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:42,850
That's how,
that's how big these wines were.

144
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,300
And I was there with the guy from like
Zach,

145
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:49,660
he's or whatever the different
southerby's they did the guys that set

146
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:52,810
the standard and write the thing and I
was watching him taste it and write down

147
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,610
notes.
It was really wild.

148
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,470
Nutmeg to leather,
mushrooms,

149
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,850
earth,
you know,

150
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:01,950
all kinds of weird tasting those.
It's still subject.

151
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:06,860
My buddy matt is a huge wine head.
Like he's got his own cellar in his

152
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:09,170
house.
It's all temperature controlled.

153
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,920
And if I'm out at a restaurant,
I'll call Matt [inaudible],

154
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,600
Matt Lichtenberg.
I'll call him up and I'll,

155
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,171
I'll,
I'll go,

156
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:15,920
hey,
okay,

157
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,330
let me tell you what I got.
Yeah,

158
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:18,920
tell me what to get.
And he'll just like,

159
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,720
oh,
the reason why this is this one socks

160
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,150
and stay away from this one and this is,
this is what you want.

161
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:24,720
That's your groove right there.
Grab that one.

162
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:25,554
And I'm like,
okay,

163
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,990
well he's always right.
Yeah.

164
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,340
The brand has been known as a new wine.
Kai Kai has a ridiculous,

165
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,320
a good one.
I've had that at 97.

166
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,170
Ron is a wine head.
Yeah.

167
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,640
Yeah.
He has some up quite a few bottles of

168
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:41,600
opus one apparently.

169
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,180
Which is this one is not,
that's as it guys.

170
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,940
Way better than opus one.
Look at what you wrote here last night

171
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,580
was mad real fresh out of advil.
Jesus.

172
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:51,020
Grab the wheel.
Sheesh.

173
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,900
Vegan fucked up a Lebron James.
I think I brought that wine to the one

174
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:57,710
with the yellow.
Uh,

175
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,370
I think you did.
I think I brought that here.

176
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,530
I think you did.
Yeah,

177
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,610
it looks very familiar.
Yeah.

178
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,320
That's some good ass fucking wine.
Schatz home old cliche.

179
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,120
Good ass.
Why Mr. Super Athlete and there you go.

180
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,100
That's a real one.
Why?

181
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,960
There's some real super athletes.
We go,

182
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:13,280
listen,
he's an Avatar.

183
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,930
Fuck what kind of steroids you take.
Never going to look like that.

184
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,710
Never.
Never.

185
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,760
Like there's,
there's human beings that have just the

186
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:27,410
most unfathomable physical advantages.
It's ridiculous.

187
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,430
Like Lebron James would have like an
unfathomable physical advantage over

188
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:36,380
someone who had have an unfathomable
physical advantage over you.

189
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,660
Yeah.
Well I think I asked the guy who follows

190
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,700
this,
Jimmy Burke about Lebron James and

191
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:41,900
called them up and I just,
I left.

192
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,280
I left him one message.
I go,

193
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,783
I said,
Jim,

194
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,060
and I want you to be honest and don't
insult me.

195
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,480
At what age did Lebron James Surpass me
as an athlete and be careful with your

196
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:54,270
fucking answer.
He said,

197
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,770
because I'm a proud man that man and
I'll kick your fucking ass.

198
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,250
I hung up the phone,
I got a very thoughtful,

199
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,310
very thoughtful,
this station and I just got this 12

200
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:07,610
years old and there's no question about
that 12 by the time he was 14 six four

201
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:10,610
two 35 best player in the country.
You were not that.

202
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,530
You're not even close to that.
He was 14 and he was six four,

203
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,370
yeah,
he's a freak and there you go.

204
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh six,
nine two 65.

205
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,720
And I sat next to Carlos Boozer who
played with him and they're the same

206
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:24,440
size.
And he goes,

207
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,890
he's just a step faster.
And everybody as well as as and just

208
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:30,500
ridiculously strong.
We'll see a guy like that.

209
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,380
If he was fighting,
everybody would be fucked.

210
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,330
Of course the,
they're lucky.

211
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,590
They are God damn lucky.
There's that much money at basketball.

212
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,590
Right?
He's incredible.

213
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,780
And then people go,
well,

214
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:44,750
you know what man,
some things that make great looking at

215
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,780
basketball player wouldn't necessarily
make you a great fighter.

216
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,550
Um,
listen,

217
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,870
listen to me.
Save it.

218
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,060
That guy's going to beat your fucking
ass.

219
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,940
This he's a winner.
There's,

220
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,980
there's just a certain

221
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,330
level of winners.
They like,

222
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,950
he do whatever the fuck you want.
Bo Jackson could have done ever.

223
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,460
I worked with Bo Jackson for a week.
Did you?

224
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,031
Yes,
I did.

225
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:07,410
And he was,
um,

226
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,371
and I said,
oh,

227
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:09,640
what do you,
what do you weigh?

228
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:12,870
He was in a white t shirt and I was
looking at the thickness of his fingers.

229
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,260
You know me,
I have sas because I'm basically a gay

230
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:17,610
man.
So I was,

231
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,680
I was looking at his hands,
I grabbed his hands.

232
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:22,350
It was just this giant me and I said,
what do you,

233
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,193
he goes,
um,

234
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,211
he said,
I remember in her,

235
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:25,470
he was so weird.
It's so specific.

236
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:28,440
He said,
I'm 61 and a half,

237
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:33,441
240 pounds to 245 pounds.
And he was the same size when he played

238
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:35,430
and he never has lifted weights in his
life ever.

239
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:36,780
And he didn't lift weights.
When he play,

240
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,340
he would just,
as in his words,

241
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,790
I just strap it on and I'd hear the
other team go on posing the game,

242
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,600
posing in the game.

243
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,250
But you have to also understand at Bo
Jackson,

244
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,340
not only did whatever you want it to you
on the football field faster and

245
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:50,340
everybody at two 45 and stronger.
He was also a,

246
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,410
was he,
was he not an MVP in baseball star?

247
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:56,220
At least start that.
That's unheard of.

248
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,730
Deion sanders play both ways,
but there's no one like Bo Jackson free.

249
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:01,620
That's crazy.
Throwing Bibi's,

250
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,510
throwing fucking ropes from center
field.

251
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,680
I mean he,
the whole different,

252
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,120
a whole different kinds of one tackle
one hip injury that's changed all that

253
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:11,170
shit.
Well it was his hip started to die or

254
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,380
have some kind of in a crisis in this
bone or something.

255
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,800
Let's from getting hit,
there was a very famous hit that he got

256
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,350
tackled.
You could see like the impact that has

257
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:21,900
on his hips when he goes down.
At least I am I remembering that

258
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:22,290
correctly.

259
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,230
There was a video,
right?

260
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,073
Yeah,
yeah,

261
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,190
yeah.
You can see the injury and it's just a

262
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,800
ridiculous half.
And we still came back and was smashing

263
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:31,680
home runs with a fake hip,
came back and played baseball.

264
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,960
Just couldn't really run anymore,
you know,

265
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,300
just a different kind of,
just a different kind of wonder if they

266
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,400
could fix that hip.
Now you know,

267
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,770
you think about what his hip was then
and what does hip is now?

268
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,130
Well,
I think you'd have to read,

269
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,700
you have to generate their tissue.
So I don't know if we're there yet,

270
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:47,430
but we're getting close.
What I mean is like the artificial hips.

271
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:48,900
I wonder if there,
those are better now.

272
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,720
I don't know it did you read a book
called Sapiens?

273
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:53,070
I sent you a,
probably not,

274
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:54,660
but Yuval Harari.
Everybody should read it.

275
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:57,420
It's an amazing book and it's a brief
history of mankind,

276
00:10:57,421 --> 00:11:01,950
but it brings us to present day and he
also wrote another book called Homo

277
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,310
Deus,
I think.

278
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,920
When should you send this to me?
I sent you a screenshot.

279
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,790
I said,
you've got to read this book,

280
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,300
but Oh,
but he,

281
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:10,440
he talks about where we're headed
technologically.

282
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:14,940
He's really done the research.
I mean really looking honestly at what

283
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,410
medical research,
what to expect in the next 30 years.

284
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,211
You say,
well,

285
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,044
I mean,
you know,

286
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,910
not only are we going to live much
longer if you have the money,

287
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,070
but the real question he ends the book
with in a way is we have to decide as

288
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:31,650
human beings,
for the first time in our history,

289
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:35,640
we can control our own evolution.
So we have to ask ourselves what we want

290
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:39,270
to become.
That's a really big responsibility.

291
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,670
What do you want to become?
What do we want to become?

292
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,710
Because that question can be answered.
We will have the technology to answer

293
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:49,650
that question and,
and it can get silly where you can say,

294
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:53,070
we could splice our genes with Elian or
with a gorilla.

295
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,093
But,
but

296
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,300
more importantly,
we'll be able to splice our genes with

297
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,500
synthetic biology and become what it,
but it's a very heavy question.

298
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,420
What do you if so if you want to live
forever,

299
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:07,090
if you become what he called,
I think it was a moral,

300
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,960
uh,
or a different word for it.

301
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,140
But we're going to get mad at you for
fucking 50 year olds.

302
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,120
Like they don't know anything yet.
God,

303
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:16,240
how could you fuck a 50 year old?
You'd be like a thousand years old.

304
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,130
I know you'll,
you'll be so smart.

305
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:19,680
And so,
so why is people go,

306
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,150
you know how gross you are.
You're fucking someone who's 50 years

307
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:24,250
old as a human.
We figured,

308
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,950
look,
we only think of ourselves as like,

309
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,600
Oh,
you should have your shit together by 50

310
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,520
because we know we only lived to be a
hundred.

311
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,650
But the reality is most people don't get
their shit together.

312
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,370
Period.
Yeah.

313
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,230
Like that.
It's a race that nobody's winning.

314
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,600
Yes,
but we all know that if we just,

315
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,540
if we had an infinite amount of time,
we would keep getting better at getting

316
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,670
our shit together.
You would not be who you were yesterday

317
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:44,680
and hopefully you'd be much better than
you were a year ago.

318
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,330
But I think about something different.
Like I,

319
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,450
that's the case though.
But if you get to 900 years old,

320
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,400
are you still allowed to bang 50 year
olds?

321
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,970
Like live?
Like if she's a fucking kid,

322
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:56,080
bro.
I mean when is it?

323
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:59,380
Okay.
I mean if she's super hot and vampires,

324
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,380
vampires,
fuck like 30 year olds,

325
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,830
but we're talking about people,
Bro.

326
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,040
I'll talking about like,
you're apparently not if you can live,

327
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,830
if they figure out medical science and
this is not outside the realm of

328
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,560
possibility,
they can regenerate tissue and you stem

329
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:14,260
cells to rejuvenate your body and you
live 900 fucking years old.

330
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,050
Are you allowed to bank 50 year olds or
are you gross?

331
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,740
Well,
it takes to actually have what I think

332
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,900
the answer is,
it takes time and it,

333
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:26,320
and it flips it on its head.
I mean time no longer has a consequence

334
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:27,880
because there's not,
you have very,

335
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:30,100
you don't really have limitations.
We had the biggest thing about human

336
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:30,461
beings,
right,

337
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:32,140
is that we have limitation.
We know we're going to die.

338
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,920
That's the fundamental difference
between sort of a,

339
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,240
the idea of a a robot being just like a
human,

340
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,750
we are defined by our limitations.
Right.

341
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:44,290
But you know why they bring the,
the draft around and try to get young

342
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,230
people to get drafted.
I didn't want to go out to their 40 year

343
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:51,100
olds and 50 year olds would think cause
it won't work like a wonder if it gets

344
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:52,270
to a certain age.

345
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,540
I wonder if you live to a certain age
and like cults just don't work anymore.

346
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,630
I wonder if it only works up until
you're like 50 or 60 or 70 but if people

347
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:02,620
live forever it would be just like
telling Santa Claus to like a little

348
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:04,450
kid.
Like it tell Santa Claus to your five

349
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:05,261
year olds.
They're like Whoa,

350
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,480
Santa Claus is real.
Yeah.

351
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,110
He tells the Santa Claus to a 15 year
old.

352
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:09,760
They're like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

353
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,050
The same kid,
it'd be like,

354
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:11,920
Dad,
you're retarded.

355
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,140
Like stop.
This is the sense that it depends on

356
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:15,160
how,
how,

357
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,830
whether you or not,
you've brought your understanding.

358
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,380
There are a lot of old coal,
but if you're a cult leader and you're

359
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:22,870
900 years old and you just bang and all
these 50 year old ladies,

360
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,730
you're an asshole.
They're like little kids still.

361
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,760
Maybe,
maybe,

362
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,230
well,
50 year olds are not gonna look like 50

363
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:33,330
year olds.
Now they're going to look.

364
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,650
It got really hot.
But my point is like there was still

365
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:39,310
beating me naive.
They still put the holy water on

366
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,540
themselves.
They still do.

367
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,830
You know there's going to be awake,
weird shit,

368
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,910
but there'll be attracted to that 900
year old cars full of wisdom

369
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:47,110
possibility.
A sorcerer.

370
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,240
Yeah.
It was kind of power you to have your

371
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,830
nine years old.
As you get older,

372
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:52,070
that of life breaks

373
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,540
down.
You're out when you're younger and you'd

374
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,590
see somebody who's really good at
something,

375
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:55,101
you're like,
God,

376
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:57,050
they're a genius.
And then you kind of get,

377
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,121
you start,
you know,

378
00:14:58,121 --> 00:15:00,800
you get to a certain days where you get
good at something or you just start to

379
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,400
do it enough and you go,
there's a certain formula to success.

380
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,650
Like sometimes like it to be really good
at something.

381
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:07,220
There's a,
there's a,

382
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,320
there's a,
there's a mindset for competition.

383
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:13,100
But to be really good at something also
just requires a shitload of repetition

384
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:15,800
and good toodle edge.
There's a lot of touching,

385
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,560
a lot of focus.
And one of the things that you recognize

386
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:22,280
in people when you,
you see another enough people that are

387
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:25,610
like really truly awesome at something,
you see enough of them,

388
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,890
you start to recognize this like thing.
Like,

389
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:32,891
I especially can see it in musicians
because I have zero talent cause I have

390
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,870
zero musical talent whatsoever.
Zero.

391
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,400
Have you ever tried to actually hold a
tune?

392
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,490
You're trying to just try this,
try to sing all serious.

393
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:41,324
Don't laugh.
No.

394
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,410
Try to sync.
Just look at me.

395
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:43,520
It's embarrassing,
but do it.

396
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:44,480
Okay.
Try to sing.

397
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,510
I want to sing silent night.
Holy night.

398
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,430
Try to hit it.
Don't do it right and then I'm going to

399
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:50,360
try it.
It's so hard.

400
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,940
So nervous.
It's so vulnerable.

401
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm asking this in two verses,
but isn't it funny that like making

402
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,070
noises with your mouth?
It's vulnerable.

403
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,713
Nah.

404
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,080
Oh,

405
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,273
lean.

406
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,870
That's not bad.
Oh,

407
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,480
this copy.
That was spring.

408
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:17,430
Can you get a little power?
Oh,

409
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:22,431
is Bra.
Ciao.

410
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,050
What's the rest of,
I don't know.

411
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,210
Something in heavenly peas.
Holy infant.

412
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:35,750
So tender and mild.
Oh,

413
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:42,170
so
already please

414
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,840
then leave

415
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,650
pe.

416
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,050
I went immediately to the douche singer
voice that whispery.

417
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,660
I know you did,
but you,

418
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,810
but you know what you had to do.
I think you were.

419
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,290
He was tuned was me.
Jamie entering key.

420
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,140
Don't you tell her anybody who talks to
you like that?

421
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,350
Listen to me ladies.
That's my joke about,

422
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,600
that's my joke.
Where I do I,

423
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,720
I talk about that guy.
You can say nice dressed.

424
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,110
Just don't whisper it.
That's where it's creeping.

425
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:16,760
That's funny.
That's what am,

426
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,120
I was like,
there's just some things you can't

427
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,290
whisper in life.
Like you can be like,

428
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,200
your daughter is so cute.
If you're like,

429
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,110
your daughter is so cute.
It's creepy.

430
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,410
The creepy voice is recognized,
but you know,

431
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,090
you know what?
It's a fucking confusing ass voice is

432
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:35,091
the scary voice.
You know the scary voice like next on

433
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,930
twilight zone,
like anybody taught like any scary

434
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:44,030
monster like and then they went down
that dark dark row.

435
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,680
Yeah,
like are those people who have that kind

436
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:50,010
of a scary voice this summer?
And here's

437
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,120
another one that doesn't work.
Hell just got a hot is girls all the

438
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:58,680
hottest dancing like that.
Kind of like hot and sexy.

439
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,560
There's old commercials,
remember and I would just like a weird

440
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:05,730
rhythm to the way they're talking.
They're establishing very clear

441
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:08,160
parameters for vocabulary.
Oh,

442
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:10,570
the hottest girls.
There's not going to be some soliloquy

443
00:18:10,571 --> 00:18:14,010
fees on your interpretation of
consciousness as you know it versus this

444
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,470
objective view of the universe now.
Now it's,

445
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,430
Oh,
the hobby,

446
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,530
all that.
It's dancing.

447
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,870
It's like you have these like really
short sentences.

448
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,451
Well,
so we're,

449
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:23,610
we're,
we're in tune,

450
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:26,040
we're in tune with those rhythms.
Those girls are saying,

451
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,330
look,
to cut the bullshit.

452
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,270
We're down to fuck.
We've got fake tits and we're drunk.

453
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,670
That's what they're saying with that
voice.

454
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:34,140
Like that's what that voice is.
Did you ever,

455
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,300
did you ever hear the experiment they
did where they played?

456
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,160
Um,
doctors?

457
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,850
So they took,
they took different doctors and some had

458
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:46,200
been sued a lot and then they just took
the doctors at bedside.

459
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:50,850
They recorded them speaking and they
took out the words so you could only

460
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:55,800
hear the tone of their voice.
And people said,

461
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,380
I don't like that guy.
And they didn't even know what they were

462
00:18:58,381 --> 00:18:59,171
saying.
They say,

463
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,020
I don't like that guy.
And without,

464
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:04,680
almost like most of them chose the
doctors that had been sued.

465
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:09,681
And it turned out that they had a
dominant tone so that their tone and the

466
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,530
sound of their voice was what people
objected to.

467
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,440
And because their bedside manner was a
saddle,

468
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,340
Malcolm Gladwell's book,
their bedside manner was,

469
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,990
was dominant.
They weren't,

470
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,180
they weren't sort of understanding and
listening.

471
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:26,310
They were rather telling the patient
something.

472
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,040
Those were the doctors regardless of
their,

473
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,410
their errors and what they did,
um,

474
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:32,910
that had nothing to do with their
degrees.

475
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,800
Didn't even have do with it what they
did.

476
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,780
Um,
those were the ones that got sued for

477
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:37,770
malpractice.
Don't remember.

478
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,790
That's from blink,
right?

479
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,530
Yes.
I think it's from blank blinks are great

480
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:41,041
book.
Yeah,

481
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:41,940
it is.
It's great.

482
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,090
And it's a great audio book too.
I got that one on audio book.

483
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,490
I listened to it on audio.
It's a very,

484
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,250
I always listen to shit on audio.
I listened to Sapiens on audio.

485
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,810
It's very good drive.
Yeah,

486
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:54,000
it's very good way to uh,
you know,

487
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:57,000
I like podcasts but I like to mix it up
and it's like,

488
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:58,920
I don't want to only watch
documentaries.

489
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,700
I like watching fiction too.
Oh,

490
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:01,890
work watching.
I like,

491
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,040
I like to mix things up with,
with would I take in and what have you.

492
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,950
But I think that like audio books in
particular,

493
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,040
it's a great way to utilize like wasted
time.

494
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,910
Yeah.
100%.

495
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,710
100%.
Instead of listening to music.

496
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:16,080
I always listened to,
I listen to a whole course on Nietzsche

497
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,660
would,
how crazy was that story and blink about

498
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:23,661
the artwork where they found this good
statue and this art expert looked at it

499
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,890
for a second and went,
it's fake.

500
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,760
How much would you be or what came to
his mind back?

501
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,670
Remember the word that came to what he
says?

502
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:32,100
Nay.
He knew it was fake because new,

503
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,240
nope,
close when it was supposed to be up.

504
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:38,630
Statute was buried for 3000 years.
A Kudos,

505
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:40,980
right?
Like a fully formed Kudos is young boy

506
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:43,260
in Greek,
so it's a fully formed like statute,

507
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:45,300
which is near a thessaloniki or
something.

508
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,190
And they tested the,
the marble

509
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,550
came from Macquarie near there.
They even tested the mold,

510
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,200
which actually turned out to be somebody
put it on potatoes,

511
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:55,180
but they,
but the mold seemed legit and all that

512
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:57,010
stuff and,
but he,

513
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,120
the minute he saw it,
he said,

514
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,670
can you get your money back?
This is a fake.

515
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:02,620
And he didn't know why,
but the first word that came to mind was

516
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:04,060
fresh,
fresh,

517
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,230
kind of crazy,
right?

518
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,150
Yeah.
Mason something you're supposed to here,

519
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,530
but isn't it crazy?
And he was right.

520
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,080
Yeah.
Then you could just see like for you and

521
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:12,130
I would be like,
wow,

522
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,750
crazy statue.
You know what I mean?

523
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,140
We wouldn't have,
but there's certain things that I'm sure

524
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:18,190
you could see.
You know,

525
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,880
like there's certain things like here's
one that I see all the time.

526
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,150
Um,
I see when people are about to spin from

527
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,380
all my years of taekwondo.

528
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,200
Oh yeah.
Like a little simple dip that people go,

529
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:30,050
I was getting,
he's looking at her.

530
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:31,690
Did you call that a lot?
All the time.

531
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,580
Because you see,
once you learn it when you're a little

532
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:34,900
kid,
cause he'd been kicked in the head a few

533
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:36,760
times,
like it becomes a part of your life.

534
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:39,370
How does recognition see this little
thing always kind of spin he's trying to

535
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:40,480
spend,
you know,

536
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,940
and you see it.
And as a regular person,

537
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:44,170
I was like,
how the fuck are you seeing that?

538
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,790
Well,
I've seen it cause people would hit me.

539
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,560
Yeah,
don't get hit by that.

540
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,423
Yeah.
Like when you see that,

541
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,061
like,
oh,

542
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:49,920
get out of there.
Yeah.

543
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,710
Well one of the wealthiest guys,
my friend who made $1 billion more,

544
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,830
his buddy is worth some crazy amount of
money.

545
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,170
And uh,
so what's your secret?

546
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,093
And he said,
uh,

547
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,150
mirrors and windows.

548
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,200
So what do you mean?
He said,

549
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,420
I can tell if somebody is going to pay
me back.

550
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:06,100
I can tell if somebody is a good
investment or not.

551
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,191
And he said,
well how?

552
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:08,350
And he goes,
you had to got windows,

553
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:09,980
you've got mirrors for eyes and if you
got married,

554
00:22:09,981 --> 00:22:11,080
surprise,
you can go fuck yourself.

555
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:13,570
You've got windows.
I'm a lending money and that's an

556
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:16,750
instinct he would just pick up on.
He got [inaudible] Saturday and he could

557
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:18,700
pick up on whether or not you were a
phone.

558
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,300
You know that's a real problem with
communicating with people in nonverbal

559
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:26,950
ways in non purse non-face-to-face ways.
Yeah,

560
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,650
it's a real problem with like texting
and stuff like that.

561
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,100
You're not looking into the person.
Like I think it changes the way we talk

562
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,840
to each other.
It changes interactions.

563
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:37,990
And I think most of the problem that
people have most of the time with each

564
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:40,600
other,
there's not talking like today and

565
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,570
especially not talking enough,
looking at each other in the eyes.

566
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,400
That's exactly figuring out like if
maybe someone's,

567
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,670
someone's right,
maybe you're wrong about something.

568
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,970
You got to talk to them and you go,
okay,

569
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:50,680
well when did you think I was supposed
to do?

570
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,090
And I did that.
Okay.

571
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,890
Okay.
And what time were you supposed to be

572
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:55,270
there?
What time did we say?

573
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,750
I thought we said this and you can try
to figure it out while you're looking at

574
00:22:58,751 --> 00:22:59,584
each other.
Right.

575
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,000
You know when someone gets say,
look man,

576
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:04,180
I was really bummed out.
You know it was a really important

577
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:06,370
thing.
He was supposed to pick me up and then

578
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,520
you could work it out and look at each
other and work with that.

579
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,840
But when you go through these series of
text messages,

580
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:13,060
I've had text messaged discussions with
people are like,

581
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:14,530
hey man,
I can't do this.

582
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:15,970
Like let's just talk.
Can we just talk,

583
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:19,240
cause this is crazy cause I don't know
what your face is making when you're

584
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:22,330
making the statement,
you're saying something and it's not

585
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:25,300
entirely accurate and I'm trying to
figure out what the fuck your face looks

586
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:26,500
like.
We are you laughing?

587
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,890
Is this lol right.
We look at each other cause I bet we

588
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,740
could work this shit out.
You know that that's,

589
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,750
that is the problem with reading
sometimes about something and thinking

590
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,210
you're getting the whole picture.
What I like about Thaddeus Russell is

591
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,610
that he,
his book or renegade history of the

592
00:23:42,611 --> 00:23:43,570
United States,
I think it's called,

593
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,650
he actually takes a look at

594
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,680
things that I've never heard.
I was a history major and historians

595
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:52,040
tend to be pretty conservative,
stodgy people,

596
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:52,691
right?
They,

597
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:53,660
they're not,
you know,

598
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,050
but your average college professor is a
pretty conservative guy.

599
00:23:57,051 --> 00:24:00,200
Even though he might be very left wing,
they're conservative people.

600
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:01,370
They're,
they're not,

601
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,490
they're not young.
I'm not going to find them at an orgy or

602
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,450
you know,
usually or various things.

603
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,870
And especially with historians and when
they write history,

604
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,380
they always write it from this really
stodgy kind of,

605
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:16,010
you hear about the events,
you actually don't hear about what it

606
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:19,040
was like in the brothels.
You don't hear about what it smelled

607
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,620
like in the bars.
You don't hear about the noise.

608
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:25,820
You don't hear about things that
actually have an effect on people.

609
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:28,010
Who are the criminals,
how safe are the streets?

610
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,470
Where were the prostitutes who was
actually getting laid?

611
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,520
Was there a lot of black and white sex
that went on in during the revolutionary

612
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:36,980
where,
which apparently there was a,

613
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:39,860
what about dancing on a dirty white
ladies?

614
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,750
It got some dark Dick.
I only,

615
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,260
I can only hope I co it's the ultimate
fuck you to your dad.

616
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,570
Yes it is.
Yes it is.

617
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,720
How many chicks just fucking couldn't
wait.

618
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,410
I know as soon as it was,
the veil was lifted,

619
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,030
you know,
as they say,

620
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,240
my dad is fighting to keep you asleep.
I'm fine to suck your Dick Dave.

621
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,660
It sounds like a title little hot dirty
white girl with freckles.

622
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,370
Apparently there was a lot of that
because what they would do is the Irish

623
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:12,020
who come in,
they were indentured servants.

624
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,240
Then you have this black slaves and they
danced.

625
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,070
They would go,
there'd be like these,

626
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,650
these speakeasies and everybody would
mingle.

627
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,890
It'd be late at night,
black but beautiful black women and you

628
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:23,480
know,
the black and white dudes be like,

629
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,440
dude,
these girls are hot.

630
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,420
You know,
and there was mixing and everything else

631
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:28,100
and there was all kinds of shit like
that.

632
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,120
Remember slavery was being talked about
is I'm great moral evil.

633
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:34,610
Really back when this country was
founded,

634
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,640
what really kind of,
one of the things they say that kept

635
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,850
slavery going another hundred years was
the cotton gin,

636
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,320
was the fact that Eli Whitney invented a
machine that made it fucking really,

637
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:48,590
really easy to separate the seed from
the cotton.

638
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,990
And as a result,
this guy comes up with a great invention

639
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:51,651
and it's rough.
They were like,

640
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:54,140
Whoa,
we got all this free labor down here.

641
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,540
I'm not free and slaves.
This shit is white gold.

642
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,890
I can send it over,
I can send it to Europe,

643
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,580
and there's an insatiable demand for my
cotton fuck that I'm not going to have.

644
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,010
My whole economy is built on the fact
that I've got all this free labor and

645
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:07,130
I'm making a fortune.
So a lot of historians kind of talk

646
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:11,070
about how Eli Whitney invented a machine
that was really efficient but might've

647
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,740
been responsible for keeping an entire
group of people in slavery for.

648
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,450
That is so crazy to think about.
Well,

649
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,110
you came up with an idea.
He came up with a cotton gin,

650
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:22,940
most of the clothes that were made out
of hemp,

651
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,620
hemp fiber for everything,
and apparently it's way better than

652
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:29,620
cotton.
It's stronger for sure.

653
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,990
I stronger todd mccormick.
Do remember my friend Tom Mccormick,

654
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:38,290
he had this stock of hemp in his house
and it was like from a hemp tree and

655
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,790
it's like,
it's from another planet.

656
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,370
It doesn't seem like it's a real thing,
so really

657
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,370
hard,
but it's really light.

658
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,440
It's light like,
like Balsa wood,

659
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,910
but it's hard.
Like,

660
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,070
oh cool.
Like it's weird.

661
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,900
It's cool.
And he was explaining to me,

662
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:57,180
and he knows way more about me than I
do,

663
00:26:57,181 --> 00:26:57,841
but he was like,
dude,

664
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:00,750
it's an alien planet and it's an error
on the alien planet.

665
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,450
It's very hearty.
We'd write an alien plant.

666
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,140
It's like no other plant.
It has all the essential amino acids.

667
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,360
You,
you get essential oils from it.

668
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,090
It has protein in it,
a very high protein content.

669
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,340
Like you can eat hemp seeds are great
for you,

670
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,610
Huh?
They're really healthy and you can make

671
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,150
clothing out of it.
You can make fuel out of it.

672
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:23,850
Hemp fuel.
Henry Ford made the first fenders on the

673
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,820
first model t out of Ham.
Fiber's really an,

674
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,660
there's a video of him hitting them with
a hammer and the hammer bounces off.

675
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,140
These hemp vendors,
they're far more durable than steel.

676
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,170
That's crazy.
It's an insane fiber man.

677
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:40,500
It doesn't make any sense.
It literally is like no other fiber on

678
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:44,280
the planet.
It's a really complex fiber and it's

679
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:46,880
illegal and it's illegal.
You can go home,

680
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,010
can't you grow hemp.
You just can't grow the female plant and

681
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:54,570
the government is doing their best to
make cbds being regulated by the FDA.

682
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,630
They're all trying to stop CB.
There's people that are trying to stop

683
00:27:57,631 --> 00:27:59,430
cbd.
It doesn't even have a psychoactive

684
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:00,420
effect on you.
Well,

685
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:02,120
the guy who invented that,
I mean,

686
00:28:02,121 --> 00:28:03,780
I don't know if he had vetted the dark
web,

687
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:05,100
but the the Silk Road Guy.
Oh,

688
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,880
brexit.
Yeah.

689
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,190
I got to point this out.
This is really important though.

690
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:10,170
Before I forget,
the CBD oil folks,

691
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,320
there's a,
I'm reading a lot of reports online of

692
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:15,960
people testing cbd and it tests positive
for thc.

693
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,800
Greg Fitzsimmons talked about this.
He said that he tried cbd oil and he got

694
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:21,960
him high.
I don't know what he used,

695
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:24,000
which company he used,
but the,

696
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,490
the,
the studies that I've read where people

697
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:28,840
have actually got them tested,
there's,

698
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,410
there's thc in some of them,
so you've gotta be careful,

699
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,230
especially if you have some ups job or
somewhere that,

700
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,830
I don't know if ups tests where they
test your piss.

701
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,590
If you,
if you take cbd oil for pain and

702
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:42,510
inflammation,
you've got to really make sure you trust

703
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:45,120
the sources because I guess apparently
it can,

704
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,670
it can have thc in it.
When you didn't you point that out.

705
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,100
I don't know if I did,
but I've seen that same thing for two

706
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:52,690
weeks.
I think you're the one who told me about

707
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:53,710
it first.
Yeah.

708
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,410
It's not just cause we were talking
about Greg,

709
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,300
like Greg,
it's high off CBD oil.

710
00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:00,880
Mike.
Like maybe it's just like a super

711
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:03,100
lightweight,
but I don't think so.

712
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,260
Maybe.
I think there's some weed and some of

713
00:29:05,261 --> 00:29:07,270
them I think might just be super
sensitive.

714
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,500
I love the weed.
Yeah.

715
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,440
I think if you just give him a regular
cbd oil,

716
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:13,780
Betty be fine.
It might not even just be the CBD oil.

717
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:17,050
I have noticed a something like head
shops and some states that it's not

718
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:20,110
recreationally available.
They're selling it in the same form as

719
00:29:20,111 --> 00:29:24,580
like dabs and concentrates and you smoke
the CBD the same way you would smoke

720
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:26,560
that heavy concentrated shit.
Whoa.

721
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,290
And that crazy like dab rig with a hot
torch.

722
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,430
So you smoke cbd oil that doesn't get
you high and the Dab rig and that,

723
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,060
I don't know what it is to sleep better.
It didn't work.

724
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,560
It didn't.
I'll tell you what works.

725
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,980
Smoking weed,
you a a hard time sleeping.

726
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,180
Yeah.
What?

727
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,380
Uh,
anymore so much.

728
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:45,490
But you know,
I always worry,

729
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,433
yeah,
that'll do it.

730
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

731
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,550
I worry that I,
you know,

732
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:54,250
he's just go,
it's interesting sometimes it just,

733
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,910
I feel guilty about being so lucky.
I get into my really soft bed and I do

734
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,800
what I love and I'm like,
what does the other foot gonna drop

735
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,930
here?
If you really stop and think about how

736
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:08,960
lucky you are in comparison to the vast
majority of human doings are,

737
00:30:08,961 --> 00:30:11,080
it's ridiculous.
What you know.

738
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,520
Well,
I'm what?

739
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,730
You know,
it's,

740
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,260
I have zero tolerance for people that
talk about how hard things are today.

741
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,070
Like they're complicated today.
Yeah.

742
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,250
They're not hard.
It's complicated.

743
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,390
Yeah.
Way More complicated.

744
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:24,220
Of course there are hard moments.
No one's,

745
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,370
no one's denying your,
your pain and your hard moments.

746
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:29,440
If you get a cut on your hand,
you're not going to get gang green.

747
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,030
Yeah.
It's just way easier.

748
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,800
A little thing.
You don't have to worry about the,

749
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:35,980
the pox.
There's so much more today.

750
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,250
It's a,
this is a fucking crazy time and

751
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:40,270
there's,
it's still,

752
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,240
the thing about this time is,
the good thing about it is,

753
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,860
yeah,
we're overpopulated.

754
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:45,760
Yeah.
We're crazy.

755
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,350
Yeah.
This is the system we were operating on.

756
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,160
Doesn't make a whole lot of sense,
but you could still go into the woods at

757
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:53,020
any moment.
Like there's a place where you can go

758
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:54,760
right now,
we can go in the woods.

759
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,310
Like you could go,
you can go to big bear and you just go

760
00:30:57,311 --> 00:30:58,120
for a hike.

761
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,350
Also in you're in the forest like,
oh,

762
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:00,970
this shit's still real.
It's still,

763
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,530
this is still here too.
Right.

764
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,300
You know?
Yay.

765
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,810
Yeah,
life is crazy and life's bizarre,

766
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:07,780
but we haven't completely turned the
whole world into a city.

767
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,240
That's true.
Guess what bitch that's coming.

768
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:15,460
We looked out big Los Angeles is,
it's much of it is covered in concrete

769
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,040
and streets and then the streets go off
everywhere,

770
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,110
like veins and,
oh by the way,

771
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,710
200 years ago,
no streets aren't there,

772
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,420
but are in town.
We'll admins is expanding in this

773
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:26,890
country.
Is that wrong?

774
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,260
I do not think that wildernesses are
expand.

775
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:31,040
There's more grazing land and stuff.
I,

776
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:32,710
I don't know.
I mean we're definitely suffering from

777
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:35,680
urban sprawl,
but I was surprised to see how little,

778
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,000
like the percentage of of the
continental United States has actually

779
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,000
inhabited that actually has houses and
on,

780
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,590
it was really small.

781
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,030
It surprised me that she had added me.
Yeah,

782
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:46,930
it's pretty small.
Super.

783
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:49,220
It's crazy how 6% or something.
Yeah,

784
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,100
and these little areas,
but yeah,

785
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:56,101
I'm like these people that live in these
small towns all across the country does

786
00:31:57,641 --> 00:31:59,230
a big reason.
Also why trump won.

787
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,490
They just felt totally unrepresented by
all the people that live on the sides.

788
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,810
I also think it's because they had,
I think 50% of Americans have what,

789
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:10,030
$500 in their bank account?
Something crazy.

790
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:11,180
Yeah.
She might be less than that.

791
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,490
$400 it's $400 think about that.
So that's why I get mad when people

792
00:32:15,491 --> 00:32:16,600
character.
I don't like trump,

793
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,780
but I never liked when people
characterized all trump supporters as

794
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:20,710
racist,
et Cetera.

795
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:24,700
I thought it was unfair because I think
the majority of people want to live in

796
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:26,740
some dignity,
and they had Obama,

797
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,240
eight years of Obama say,
but you will.

798
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:30,280
But their lives didn't change for a lot
of reasons.

799
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,230
I don't think Obama's to blame.
There's a lot of reasons.

800
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,920
And then along comes hilary's speaking
the same exact language.

801
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,200
So if you're going to blame people for
saying,

802
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:39,740
wait,
under eight years,

803
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:40,070
I still

804
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,370
only have $400 in my pocket.
Here comes a woman who's speaking the

805
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:44,510
same language.
Oh,

806
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:46,180
and by the way,
there's a lot of rumors about being or

807
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,930
being corrupt.
I have nothing to lose.

808
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:50,690
I'm going to try that other guy.
Did you see what Donna Brazil rope?

809
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,620
One of the reasons why she came out with
their book is after seth rich got

810
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:57,260
murdered and she called him a patriot.
Wow.

811
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,930
I didn't have seth rich got,
oh,

812
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:00,591
that,
that's right.

813
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:03,500
That was the guy worked for the DNC.
There was a Bernie Sanders supporter

814
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,160
that wikileaks has alluded to the fact
that he them information and got shot in

815
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:10,370
front of his house and it became this
big conspiracy theory where people would

816
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:14,330
mock you for saying it was a conspiracy
and then hannity ran with it and so it

817
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:18,200
became clearly there for a lot of people
that seth rich conspiracy theory that it

818
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:19,034
was nonsense.

819
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,860
Nobody knows what happened to that guy
though he was murdered,

820
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,460
his watch on his phone with him.
He had his wallet on him.

821
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,070
Nobody took anything from,
they shot him at four o'clock in the

822
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:29,840
morning.
Who knows what happened.

823
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,080
But when wikileaks starts saying that
you gave them information and that

824
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:37,550
there's consequences,
do you give them information?

825
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,220
One of two things is happening.
Either wikileaks has decided,

826
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:44,780
all of a sudden you start lying right
and making things up about people or

827
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:47,060
two,
they were misinformed and someone was

828
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:49,760
pretending to be this guy and sending
them information.

829
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,550
It's always possible if they can meet
face to face or three,

830
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,660
they're telling you something you didn't
know that this guy who was just shot and

831
00:33:56,661 --> 00:34:01,661
murdered was leaking information about
the DNC and other DNC was corrupted by

832
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:05,990
the Hillary Clinton group,
which is what Donna Brazil is saying in

833
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:10,940
her book and that this guy released that
and showed how the primaries were rigged

834
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:14,750
against Bernie Sanders and that Hillary
Ari was sending me excerpts from it the

835
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:15,560
other day.

836
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,161
He's like,
dude,

837
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:18,290
she was Donna.
Brazil was saying that Hillary was in

838
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,960
control at DNC before the primaries,
so,

839
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:24,560
so is the implication that Hillary might
have had something to do with his

840
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:26,540
murder.
That's the implication.

841
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,580
The information was already out.
I like maybe add more and maybe they

842
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:34,010
were punishing him to stop other people
from doing the same thing.

843
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,680
Maybe other people had more information,
you know,

844
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,540
I don't know if it's true,
but there was another guy that

845
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:41,060
disappeared reasonably.
It was a guy who,

846
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:42,980
uh,
had dirt on the Clintons.

847
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,210
Some,
some guy vanished.

848
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,130
This is like really,
really recent.

849
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,540
Like,
see if you could find that one.

850
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,810
Some guy just read,
just type in Google Clinton dirt.

851
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:53,060
And this is like from Newsweek.
So there's,

852
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,420
people have vanished and I dunno how
many of them had been murdered.

853
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,060
People suicide themselves.
I don't know how many of them actually

854
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:01,690
suicide themselves,
but it could,

855
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,470
let's just say one out of 10,
just one out of 10.

856
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,940
It was an actual murder,
right?

857
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,420
This guy academic at the heart of
Clinton dirt campaign vanishes.

858
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,090
What leaving trail of questions.
It's really recently.

859
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,280
See that figured out when you kill
people.

860
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:20,390
It's my piece way hearts to maybe
usually heal people.

861
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,670
Um,
it's like God damn,

862
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,980
how does body get here?
But when people just vanish,

863
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,710
tamp,
they just vanish.

864
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,970
Oof.
That's crazy.

865
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,600
They just disappeared.
What does that do when I need him?

866
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,560
Whereas Mr Bravo and I made him crazy.
He be going crazy about that one.

867
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,501
Yeah,
but Eddie's,

868
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:38,050
Eddie's

869
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,860
conspiracies turn in on themselves
because he'd be like,

870
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,990
he's disappeared,
but he's not really.

871
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:47,880
What if he's not really dead?
Eddie?

872
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,220
Um,
he loves himself a conspiracy.

873
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:51,690
He gets so excited.
Yeah,

874
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,100
I know.
It's like watching the clock in the

875
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,040
community towards like a dude is super
into sports.

876
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,031
You know?
Like he'll,

877
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,440
he fucking,
you want to talk to me about you?

878
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:02,980
All I'm saying is it's a little weird.
Well,

879
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,320
you know what I tried to see someone was
like,

880
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:05,760
well,
why does he enjoy conspiracies?

881
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:06,420
I said,
well,

882
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,440
first of all,
enjoy them.

883
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:13,020
Enjoy what you like.
But also Eddie's always been really good

884
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,290
at like shutting down people not
believing in his ideas with Jujitsu is

885
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Eddie has like revolutionary Jujitsu.
Jujitsu is rubber guard setups and all

886
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,260
the different things.
The paths that he,

887
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,680
he fixed a lot of paths in traditional
Jujitsu,

888
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:33,990
changed a lot of things and did some
things his way.

889
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,790
And when he would describe it to me,
I was like,

890
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,370
oh,
this is a guy like has an idea how to do

891
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:41,210
things and when people are opposing.
And he's like,

892
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:41,581
no,
no,

893
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:41,891
no,
no.

894
00:36:41,891 --> 00:36:43,290
I'm going to shut that down and move
over here.

895
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,160
So That's interesting.
So it's brainworks hour.

896
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,670
So when someone comes at him with an
idea,

897
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:50,760
he has an idea and he's going to try to
get that idea through.

898
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,690
And when you come at him with some weak
attacks on that idea and just expect

899
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:57,030
that he's going to relinquish his hold
on the idea,

900
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:57,420
he's like,
no,

901
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:57,960
no,
no bitch.

902
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,010
This don't make no sense.
No,

903
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,330
you don't.
You don't have any information.

904
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,770
It's going to take someone giving him
real honest to goodness,

905
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:09,090
impossible to deny information that he's
going to believe in any of the

906
00:37:09,091 --> 00:37:11,760
conspiracies that he believes in war
being false.

907
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:16,790
Or it's going to take somebody to
explain him that his feelings control

908
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:19,020
his thinking.
That is true.

909
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,200
But there have been conspiracies that
have successfully been executed,

910
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,610
which makes this whole thing way more
confusing.

911
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,250
It's like,
which one of these were real to say that

912
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:33,270
all conspiracies are bullshit.
You are a victim of like some reverse

913
00:37:33,271 --> 00:37:34,104
racism.
Yeah,

914
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,040
no,
no,

915
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,770
I,
I'm usually skeptical of conspiracies,

916
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:42,180
especially government conspiracies
because government has no tourists so

917
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:47,210
completely out of sync and not efficient
enough and certainly there are so many

918
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:49,980
different competing interests within
government.

919
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,990
Within an administration.
Yeah.

920
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,990
Everybody's trying to undermine each
other and that's the history and it was

921
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:58,050
set up that way and even if you talk
about faking the moonlight,

922
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,430
you'd have to have about a thousand,
maybe 2000 people to keep a secret.

923
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,170
That's not necessarily the case.
If you just had people thinking on a

924
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:09,930
need to know bates basis with everything
compartmentalized,

925
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,060
like this guy's responsible for making
the o rings.

926
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,800
This guy's responsible for,
I don't know how it works.

927
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:15,330
I've known,
I don't know how it works either,

928
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:18,270
but I do know that you're talking about
if you were trying to fake the moon

929
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:19,890
landing,
one of the things that would be much

930
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:23,700
easier is your d during the Nixon
administration there were getting used

931
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,440
to fake and things.
Watergate was going on,

932
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,670
you know,
found out though,

933
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,680
you know,
cause somebody drops.

934
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,670
You just starting to develop the kind of
special effects abilities where you can

935
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:37,730
sort of recreate spacings like 2001 that
was the big conspiracy theorist dream.

936
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:42,010
Was that somehow or another like there'd
be like some irrefutable proof that

937
00:38:42,011 --> 00:38:44,320
Stanley Kubrick was the one who worked
in the moon landing.

938
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,810
That was like,
if I'd found that I'd be like common in

939
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:49,990
my pants.
Like Eddie never acknowledges that the

940
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:54,730
same impulse that drives him,
which is really to find the truth and to

941
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:59,731
be skeptical of of people's claims and
even evidence that's been written down.

942
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,420
Human beings have always,
always,

943
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,640
for the most part,
unless there's something wrong with you

944
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,170
want it to be in the know.
I don't know anyone who doesn't want to

945
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:12,760
know the truth.
I don't know anybody who doesn't want to

946
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:15,160
know,
who likes being deceived and so,

947
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,540
so it it,
that's why it's almost impossible to

948
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:23,590
keep a secret longterm in government
because somebody's always talking on the

949
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:26,140
other side of it.
Here's one of the reasons why the whole

950
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:31,141
conspiracy thing is so attractive to
people because there's a reward chain

951
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,680
built into the human psyche of solving a
problem that's presented in front of you

952
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:39,670
that could potentially be dangerous.
It's a reward chain and deserves more

953
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:42,550
chain gets acted upon.
Even if you're talking about nonsense,

954
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,520
even if this is like some area 51 you
know,

955
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:50,320
Ufo body,
fucking whatever it is,

956
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,880
Roswell,
New Mexico,

957
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:53,020
the guy who was there,
the gut,

958
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,430
the general talk to my grandma.

959
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,780
Yeah.
He told me about the coffins,

960
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:58,420
four foot tall coffin.
There were little alien babies.

961
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:00,960
I took him to the back of the hearse.
They had embalmed and Mike.

962
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,890
My aunt saw it and they killed her in
the forest.

963
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,080
Like stop,
stop.

964
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,990
I know I can't,
but when you have an explanation you

965
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,220
don't feel as unsafe.
Yeah.

966
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,260
If you,
if I tell you that there are random

967
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:13,150
things that happen.
For example,

968
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:18,180
the shooter in Las Vegas,
he was 64 and there are no signs.

969
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:20,410
He was very controlling.
If you look at these good bit of a

970
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:21,150
sociopath,
he had,

971
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,830
we had this obsession with control.
But,

972
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,410
uh,
if I just tell you that sometimes people

973
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:29,140
wig the fuck out and they just want to
shoot a bunch of people,

974
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,710
that's not appropriate because then
what's going to happen?

975
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,220
It's anxiety medication.
Sure.

976
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:35,020
But I'm sure,
but there's also like,

977
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:36,100
when you say that stuff,
it's like,

978
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,190
now what you're saying is I have no real
way to protect myself.

979
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,320
Even if I carry a gun and take all my
vitamins,

980
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:44,170
wear my seatbelt.
There's always some crazy shit I didn't

981
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:45,310
think about.
It's called faith.

982
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,300
The people I've talked to,
um,

983
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,000
that,
that understand,

984
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,280
um,
psych medicines that I've talked to,

985
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:53,170
some psychiatrists I've had on the
podcast,

986
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:55,480
listen to Kelly Brogan.
Kelly Brogan talked about it quite

987
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:57,730
extensively.
One of the things that she went,

988
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:02,200
her and many other psychiatrists brought
up is the disassociative properties have

989
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:05,500
a lot of these psych medicines that
someone might have a horrible idea in

990
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:07,690
their head,
but the repercussions of it are real.

991
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,780
Like acting on it feels real.
But as soon as you have some sort of

992
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,500
heavy disassociative psych medicine
that's not even real,

993
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,840
like you don't care anymore.
You're like,

994
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:17,674
you're like,
wow,

995
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,750
like watching yourself in a movie or
something.

996
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,673
You're,
you're,

997
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,220
you're Ron.
Something that Dole's all the highs and

998
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:25,054
the lows.

999
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,760
It puts you in this weird state where
it's okay,

1000
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,100
it's okay.
It's okay to just kill these people.

1001
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,980
Like I don't know whether or not you
could,

1002
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,440
the leap from being a person who could
never kill somebody to be in a person

1003
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:37,820
doesn't have a problem with killing
somebody.

1004
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:39,140
I don't know if that's true.
I mean,

1005
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:40,580
maybe that's a,
that's a Chaz.

1006
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:44,180
I'm too far to cross.
But I guarantee you if you're the type

1007
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:49,181
of person that is having some horrible
thoughts about like being aggressive to

1008
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:53,750
people and then someone puts you on
something that makes you like,

1009
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:56,180
I don't give a fuck.
Like it's gonna.

1010
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,420
It's gonna.
If you are Ha,

1011
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,380
who knows what the right chemical is
too,

1012
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:02,510
right?
Like if they give you the wrong one,

1013
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,360
maybe it'll switch you one way or the
right one.

1014
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,070
We'll turn the other way.
Or maybe we should add some abilify into

1015
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:08,933
the mix.

1016
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,100
Just throw some of this in there.
This is an antipsychotic to help you all

1017
00:42:13,101 --> 00:42:15,050
even out.
Do you know you can have a lesion on

1018
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:17,230
your brain?
The size of the head of a pen.

1019
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,010
You can have a lesion and if it's in the
right,

1020
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,300
there's a specific area of the brain
where it can be a tiny lesion that you

1021
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:27,500
can't see really barely with the naked
eye and it can render you a homicidal

1022
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:30,200
maniac.
Doesn't my problem fighting off the

1023
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:32,180
leash?
I got lesions in my brain.

1024
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,470
Is that true?
Yeah.

1025
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,600
What is it called?
What's the leaves?

1026
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,020
Don't know.
I could look it up for you,

1027
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:39,350
but it's by eye.
But you can use where I heard it was in

1028
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:44,351
a lecture by Daniel Robinson who is a
professor at Oxford and Georgetown and

1029
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,560
the smartest man on the planet.
That's why you have to really be careful

1030
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:50,210
when you're punching people in the head,
right?

1031
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,710
Yeah.
Yes sir.

1032
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,660
That's why it causes,
well,

1033
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,090
so the guy who,
who does that make sense?

1034
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,870
Neuroscience.
Who captured the 13 year old girl?

1035
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,740
Not Elizabeth.
SMART,

1036
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:02,660
but the other one had two children with
her,

1037
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,910
kept her for 18 years and she escaped.
Finally.

1038
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,380
Yes.
That was the guy that was,

1039
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:08,180
were were,
were to he and his wife.

1040
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:11,230
It was somewhere in like,
I think Seattle is basement.

1041
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,440
Right.
You got him in the backyard,

1042
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:14,870
in a shed for an a in a,
in a sealed about shedding and they

1043
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:16,850
lived in the backyard with the daughters
until,

1044
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,910
I mean literally she was 18 then they
would go out once in a while.

1045
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:22,240
It was real Stockholm Syndrome shit.
Oh my God.

1046
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:22,881
Then she,
oh,

1047
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:23,571
crazy.
Yeah.

1048
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:24,620
And,
and she,

1049
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,630
but she got,
he got her pregnant at 13 and it was

1050
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:28,580
just a terrible story I was going to
tell you about earlier.

1051
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,920
Did you,
did you see the footage where they have

1052
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:35,450
their selling slaves in Libya?
Is it Libya or is it Iraq?

1053
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,670
It's Libya.
There was,

1054
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,440
maybe it's in Iraq too.
Yeah.

1055
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,020
But it was Libya and they were,
you know,

1056
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:46,850
there was a,
I forget who the title it was usa today

1057
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,290
that had an editorial that said,
thanks Hilary Clinton because Hilary

1058
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,600
Clinton,
apparently they're blaming her decisions

1059
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:57,980
on the reason why we went into Libya and
dethrone Mo Market Aafia who knows?

1060
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,840
Yeah.
You would know maybe more than most,

1061
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:03,980
but video of migrants,
soul and apparent slave auction in Libya

1062
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,420
provokes outrage worldwide.
It's disturbing,

1063
00:44:06,421 --> 00:44:07,550
man.
When you watch it,

1064
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,680
they got guns to these dudes heads those
photos.

1065
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,720
I retweeted it.
If you want to go to my instagram,

1066
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:16,610
you can see some of the pictures of it.
But they have like Libya is a failed

1067
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:17,840
state now.
Yes.

1068
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,360
And it's God damn terrifying in,
um,

1069
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,080
2017.
Look at that in,

1070
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:27,790
in 1970 and my father just told a story
at,

1071
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:31,560
uh,
at Thanksgiving and he was talking how

1072
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:32,394
Dubai

1073
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:35,880
and Abu Dhabi have become these
incredible countries.

1074
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,750
And when he was first there in 1970 and
1971,

1075
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:41,850
I don't know what it was.
Um,

1076
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,770
somebody said,
you see that woman over there and she

1077
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:47,610
was a black woman.
She was from Africa somewhere and uh,

1078
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:48,830
I supply,
I said yes,

1079
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,950
he goes,
that's a slave.

1080
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,250
And that was in Dubai,
I believe back in the day.

1081
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:56,820
I'm sorry to anybody from Dubai.
I know you guys have come a very long

1082
00:44:56,821 --> 00:44:58,020
way,
but slavery was the,

1083
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,510
was order of the day for in a lot of
countries.

1084
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:03,570
I'm not just picking on you in a lot of
countries and a lot of countries,

1085
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:04,800
it was,
it was the order of the day.

1086
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:06,960
I mean the idea that slavery would no
longer be a case.

1087
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:09,030
The idea that this would be outrageous
to the world,

1088
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:14,510
um,
in 1940 would be certainly in 1910 or

1089
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:16,290
something,
it would have been like what now it will

1090
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:16,830
always go on.

1091
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,760
Slavery's is,
uh,

1092
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,350
is,
is in order,

1093
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:20,490
is the way of life.
I mean,

1094
00:45:20,491 --> 00:45:22,860
you know,
I think though today with the ability to

1095
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:27,861
film slave auctions when your cell phone
and then stream that shit I [inaudible]

1096
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,380
dot com or whatever this is,
the more you learn about people and how,

1097
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:33,990
how similar we all are and how,
you know,

1098
00:45:33,991 --> 00:45:36,540
Sam Harris had a really interesting ted
talk about this,

1099
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:40,050
about the idea that you,
you have to be able to have a

1100
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:45,051
conversation about what is the most
optimal way to live for a human being.

1101
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,360
What is the most optimal?
Is it,

1102
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:53,361
is it true that women are at their best
when having to wear a full Burka in 120

1103
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:55,800
degree heat?
That's a good question.

1104
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:56,760
Is,
is,

1105
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,700
and by the way,
are all opinions are welcome at the

1106
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:01,650
table.
Are you interested,

1107
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:04,210
I'm quoting Sam here,
but are you interested in the Taliban's

1108
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,850
point of view on physics?

1109
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,400
No.
And,

1110
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:09,420
and does,
there's someone who does,

1111
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:14,400
does for that matter and he talks about
himself is his point of view on string

1112
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:16,020
theory,
which he knows nothing about.

1113
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:18,580
Uh,
as valid as somebody who studies string

1114
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:19,220
theory.
No,

1115
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,550
no,
but we get it.

1116
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:22,470
There's a tendency to kind of go,
well,

1117
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,900
you know,
that's your culture and I'm not going to

1118
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:27,840
get involved in it,
even though it's might seem brutal by my

1119
00:46:27,841 --> 00:46:30,180
standards.
You hear this a lot with like the aztecs

1120
00:46:30,181 --> 00:46:32,760
and human sacrifice,
and it's very taboo to talk about how it

1121
00:46:32,761 --> 00:46:33,810
was Barbara,
cause you know,

1122
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:36,900
that was them.
You and me and Steven Rinella had a

1123
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:39,600
conversation about that.
Rinella literally didn't believe me when

1124
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:42,600
I told them they sacrificed 80,000.
Was it?

1125
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,210
Is that the number was a number when
they'd sacrificed the,

1126
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:46,290
the,
the,

1127
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:48,850
um,
the people who are not a huge sign of

1128
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,920
ICAN,
temple of [inaudible].

1129
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,830
Is that how you say it too?
Alcon,

1130
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,580
but apparently they'd sacrificed some
fucking insane number of slaves.

1131
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,620
So it's so crazy that if you tell a
rational personally,

1132
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,481
Steve Rinelli,
he's like,

1133
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:04,530
why I can't,
I can't be true until you go and read

1134
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:05,380
about it.
And he'd go,

1135
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:08,700
how,
how horrible where people then,

1136
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,990
yeah,
they could sacrifice.

1137
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,110
I really want to say it was 80,000
people then.

1138
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,580
That was the number,
the numbers,

1139
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,271
I don't know.
I mean,

1140
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:17,340
that's a crazy,
it's like in a couple of days,

1141
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,800
they,
all the people that worked on the temple

1142
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,260
apparently after it was over,
they just sacrificed them.

1143
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,940
Wow.
Wow.

1144
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,140
Just a minute.
The aztecs,

1145
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:26,820
they,
one of the things they say is Cortez to

1146
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:30,280
able to conquer the aztecs much,
easily over a lot more easily because

1147
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:34,060
the aztecs had neighbors that fucking
hated them because they aspects would go

1148
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:37,720
in and basically if you weren't,
you know,

1149
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,120
an Aztec,
which means you a person of the son,

1150
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,570
you'd get sacrificed.
So their neighbors were like,

1151
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:46,510
are you Spanish guys?
500 guys really will help you.

1152
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,590
100% of those.
Fuck,

1153
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:48,850
we hate him.
You know?

1154
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:51,100
So have you been to cheech and Eatsa?
No,

1155
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,740
dude,
there's a fucking platform and cheech

1156
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:55,470
needs,
so with the Mayans used to behead

1157
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,430
people,
they have the sacrifice.

1158
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,170
There was this,
there's this like thing,

1159
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:02,050
it's like a demon.
It's lying on its back.

1160
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:06,370
And they would sacrifice the people and
the stomach area where they sacrificed

1161
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:08,560
people.
It was kind of grooved out from all the

1162
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:12,880
bodies had been slicing on it day on.
Well,

1163
00:48:12,881 --> 00:48:13,810
that's why.
That's why,

1164
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,730
oh my God,
I'm wrong.

1165
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,450
It's way more is high.
It's estimates.

1166
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,120
The number of persons sacrifice and
central Mexico in the 15th century was

1167
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:26,740
as high as 250,000 per year.
But um,

1168
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:31,550
go to the construction of temple a t I
don't know how to say this.

1169
00:48:31,551 --> 00:48:33,280
He,
I contentious number by the way.

1170
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,121
Of course it is.
And people,

1171
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:36,060
like people,
a lot of people were like bullshit.

1172
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:37,520
And there's a lot of historians that had
did the,

1173
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:38,530
and publishing my book,
Bro,

1174
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:41,290
I'm jacking it up 100,000.
If I was,

1175
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,480
if I was a a historian,
I was like,

1176
00:48:43,481 --> 00:48:47,170
yeah,
40 million people died on the shores.

1177
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:49,780
Although the whole male population was
trying to be warriors.

1178
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:50,140
It was,
uh,

1179
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,460
you know,
what is the,

1180
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:56,461
uh,
c just google 80,000 aztecs sacrificed

1181
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,730
temple of tea.
I don't know how to say the word icon to

1182
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,350
a con.
I forget out.

1183
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,140
How'd he say it?
But I believe what they did was they

1184
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:09,370
built this fucking spectacular struck,
spectacular structure and then killed

1185
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:10,390
everybody worked on it.

1186
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:14,170
They just killed the union.
Kind of like El Chapo when you'd build a

1187
00:49:14,171 --> 00:49:15,850
tunnel for him and he's like,
can know where it is.

1188
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:16,331
Sorry,
could,

1189
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:20,200
could you talk apparently to have a
party for him and then you guys,

1190
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:24,550
thanks for working on the tunnel.
They have a party to toast champagne and

1191
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,380
here's some lead poisoning as well.
Super,

1192
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:29,320
super hammered when hookers and then
shoot him in the head while they're

1193
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:33,310
sleeping and can't have people know.
They said that the Soviets would do

1194
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:33,981
that.
Like when,

1195
00:49:33,981 --> 00:49:37,480
when you would build a tunnel,
did you ever hear that story about how

1196
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,590
we figured out that implementer,
what does this,

1197
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,770
this is it I say that will make that
larger please.

1198
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,280
Uh,
tiene no tiene,

1199
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,830
no Chit [inaudible].
Hmm.

1200
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,140
Um,
I don't think that's the same one.

1201
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,550
I 80,000 came up with it because that's
the number of people.

1202
00:49:57,850 --> 00:49:59,830
Okay.
Maybe I've seen it said,

1203
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,630
well,
I think also when one of the things you

1204
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,260
have to deal with when you're dealing
with a,

1205
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:08,261
an English deciphering of really ancient
Aztec and Mayan code is that it's

1206
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,610
phonetic.
So like there's sounds that they made

1207
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:14,740
that they're trying to replicate with
English words,

1208
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:17,110
but they weren't really designed for
English lettering,

1209
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,453
you know?
I mean,

1210
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,020
they're designed,
they're hieroglyphs,

1211
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:21,390
they have the,
they,

1212
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,230
the way they wrote and spoke.
It's very,

1213
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:25,600
very different than the way we do.
You know,

1214
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,970
they had a,
um,

1215
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,860
like some of the Mayan writing in
particular.

1216
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,030
What does it say there,
Jamie?

1217
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:34,920
He troward thousands of,
um,

1218
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,440
some of the,
the um,

1219
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:39,980
God,
some of the Mayan languages were like

1220
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,560
images that like,
like the tenants,

1221
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:44,870
we kind of described it this way.
He was like,

1222
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,770
you have a,
like an eyeball and a picture and then

1223
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:51,440
you'd have a saw and you'd have a,
the bug,

1224
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:52,610
the ant,
an ant,

1225
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,650
and then you'd have the flower,
the rose.

1226
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,960
And that's how you would say I saw aunt
rose.

1227
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,770
That's a weird,
yeah,

1228
00:50:59,050 --> 00:50:59,780
yeah,
yeah.

1229
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,740
Because we just assume that everyone
should,

1230
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,720
what is like,
what is writing?

1231
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,550
Writing is some symbols that you make
that correspond to certain sounds that

1232
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:15,140
we've all agreed in our own personal
definitions that we have.

1233
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:18,800
And in societies,
we've all agreed that this sound means a

1234
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:21,290
certain thing.
We argue the parameters of what that

1235
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:22,280
means.
Right?

1236
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:24,740
And that's why people get super offended
when someone says it like,

1237
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:27,260
uh,
like words are violence.

1238
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,090
Okay,
okay.

1239
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,510
Like you're,
you're fucking with the real.

1240
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,210
Exactly.
Don't know if violence and never been

1241
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:35,900
punched in the face.
You haven't seen somebody like get sold

1242
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,660
by all the silos.
Say it's so important for young people

1243
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:40,880
to understand that the difference
between things and,

1244
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:45,410
and there's a real tendency to equate,
equate.

1245
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:49,340
For example,
you wrote a memo at Google and it made

1246
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,040
an unsafe work environment for women and
your healer.

1247
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,390
Now you're Hitler,
Hitler.

1248
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:54,530
And by the way,
you know,

1249
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:57,230
crab boats,
coal mines and Navy Seals,

1250
00:51:57,231 --> 00:51:59,930
they have a pretty dangerous work
environment as well.

1251
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:01,040
So let's,
let's,

1252
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:03,920
let's talk about the fucking difference
because it's very,

1253
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,270
it's,
it's,

1254
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,300
it gets very weird and dangerous and
meaningless.

1255
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:09,950
And in fact,
in my opinion,

1256
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,030
when you equate everything,
when you basically say,

1257
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:14,691
you know,
you,

1258
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:17,690
you shouted at me,
that's assault versus breaking my nose.

1259
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,880
And we have lots of different examples
of that.

1260
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,340
It does a disservice to people that have
suffered real,

1261
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,611
you know,
violence.

1262
00:52:23,611 --> 00:52:26,280
You know what I think is going on man,
and I could sum it up in Warren word

1263
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,720
tribalism.
There's a natural inclination that we

1264
00:52:30,721 --> 00:52:35,070
have to form likeminded groups and
defend our position to the death.

1265
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,780
And this is what people are doing.
And it's not that you're wrong,

1266
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:42,420
he's right or he's right or wrong.
It's that all of us are acting like

1267
00:52:42,421 --> 00:52:44,610
people trying to protect our team.
That's right.

1268
00:52:44,611 --> 00:52:47,280
And that is a,
it's an incorrect way of behaving.

1269
00:52:47,281 --> 00:52:49,140
So if you say that like words are
violence,

1270
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:49,974
like guess what?
And

1271
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:51,060
no,
they're not.

1272
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,830
Go Fuck yourself too.
Was that violent?

1273
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,070
This is what I say.
I'm talking about this in my standup,

1274
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:55,621
but it,
and,

1275
00:52:55,621 --> 00:52:59,150
and you know,
it's much easier to be full against

1276
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,700
something.
It's really easy to be against that.

1277
00:53:00,701 --> 00:53:02,760
We joined a team.
What happens is you don't have to do the

1278
00:53:02,761 --> 00:53:03,594
thinking.
He let the,

1279
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,030
let the leader do all the thinking.
You've got the bullet points.

1280
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:09,030
Now what your job as a soldier is to put
down the other team.

1281
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,000
It's much more difficult.
And think about this for young people

1282
00:53:12,001 --> 00:53:13,950
listening,
it's way harder to define what your,

1283
00:53:13,951 --> 00:53:17,460
for defining what you're actually for.
Like so if you're a revolutionary,

1284
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:19,950
you want to burn down the whole,
the whole,

1285
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,010
you know the whole house.
What are you going to replace it with

1286
00:53:23,011 --> 00:53:24,670
men,
that's really important and

1287
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,010
revolutionary.
They did

1288
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,350
with Libya.
Revolutionaries.

1289
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:30,720
Forget that shit all the time about like
when they came,

1290
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:33,020
they saw and he died.
Right?

1291
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,080
You've got really good,
bad guy.

1292
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:34,861
Cool.
Now what?

1293
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:35,940
Now?
What are you replacing it with?

1294
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:37,500
Yes.
Well welcome to the power of vacuum.

1295
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:40,890
You hope you're going to be dead before
this fucking becomes a disaster and a

1296
00:53:40,891 --> 00:53:42,420
failed state.
Well you're not.

1297
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,330
That's,
that's my problem when when people,

1298
00:53:45,331 --> 00:53:48,090
and we have a lot of people in our
government that look at a problem and

1299
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:48,960
go,
oh,

1300
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,840
it's isis.
What we need to do is get authorization

1301
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:54,480
to kill more of them in other places.
So what you're talking about is groups

1302
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,790
that identify as isis and that's going
to solve the problem.

1303
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,210
My problem with that typically is that
it goes back to that,

1304
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,520
one of my favorite sayings is it's not
what you think.

1305
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,950
What you think is way less important
than how you think.

1306
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,890
Because a lot of times if you pay
attention to your thinking exactly the

1307
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:11,220
way your enemies snaking,
I'm not so sure that that's how you do

1308
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:13,110
it.
I'm not so sure that bombing and

1309
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:15,270
shooting your way out of that problem is
the way to go.

1310
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,480
It might be in some cases I think you
need seal team six,

1311
00:54:18,481 --> 00:54:22,860
et Cetera for certain shitheads but we
can't see the Line of defense.

1312
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,720
Everyone has to know that they're real.
Yeah.

1313
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,480
That's like one of the most important
things about the elite forces of the

1314
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:30,030
government or of our military.
He said people need to know the real.

1315
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,770
You need to know that's real cause like
there's 100,000 whatever the fuck.

1316
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,920
There are people right now that are just
ready to go.

1317
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,930
All you have to do is press a button
launch.

1318
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,390
Thank God.
Thank God for Tim Kennedy,

1319
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,890
etc. Exactly.

1320
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:46,590
Cause remember this,
you need walls,

1321
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:49,680
you need strong walls.
Those walls.

1322
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:51,600
You haven't seen enough bad people.
That's right.

1323
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:53,670
You don't cause there aren't,
the Mongols are out there.

1324
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,533
They're out there.
Yeah.

1325
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,530
Look at Libya.
It's,

1326
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,580
you're out there.
That's right.

1327
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:57,930
And these people,
by the way,

1328
00:54:57,931 --> 00:55:00,090
that are in the military that the only
ones that are experiencing it,

1329
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,620
you're,
you're back here.

1330
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,680
You're passing judgment on there saying,
hey,

1331
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:06,540
there's zombies.
Like,

1332
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,250
Hey,
we'll let the fucking world's gone

1333
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:09,240
crazy.
Hey,

1334
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:12,990
they're selling slaves in the streets.
Like we need to all know that there are

1335
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:15,870
people that are in some really horrible
parts of the world right now that can

1336
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:18,330
give you valuable information.
It doesn't mean we should kill those

1337
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:20,190
people.
It doesn't mean we should fucking nation

1338
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:23,460
build.
But we need to be aware of the landscape

1339
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,890
and keep this in mind though too,
is it's not.

1340
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,550
That would be hard strength.
You need men like,

1341
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,990
you know,
Tim Kennedy,

1342
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:32,040
et Cetera.
Those guys who are,

1343
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:34,500
who are our protectors,
who we can push a button go,

1344
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:36,930
hey those fucking guys want.
And there are people out there that want

1345
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:40,020
to kill us for sure.
But I always think that it's also

1346
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:44,610
important to remember that those guys
are doing that to protect the softer

1347
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:46,890
strengths in our community.
The people that are creative,

1348
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,070
people that are inventing,
you can't have a doctor working on a

1349
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:53,100
cure for cancer and had the Mongols come
over and smash all his fucking beakers.

1350
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:54,810
Exactly.
That's why you need those.

1351
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:57,390
So you need both.
Problem is you knew you do need both.

1352
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,590
And the people on one side don't want to
recognize the people and the other side

1353
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:02,250
cause they wished they didn't have to
exist.

1354
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,700
Exactly what they do have to exist.

1355
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:06,510
Of course they do.
There's a balance to this fucking thing.

1356
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,950
You know,
and here's the thing,

1357
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,280
people in Libya,
if Kevin Spacey had a TV show in Libya,

1358
00:56:11,281 --> 00:56:14,700
we fucked all the grips right in the
mouth before every episode they would

1359
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:15,534
go.
That's what he does.

1360
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,590
He's the fucking store.
You would just talk with this stuff.

1361
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,700
Kevin's business,
this,

1362
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,100
this bombs going off of the streets with
your mouth open.

1363
00:56:27,101 --> 00:56:31,570
Your mouth is fucking ied at every
fucking dead dog on the side of the

1364
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:33,070
road.
Kick them over.

1365
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:34,440
You lose your leg?
Yeah.

1366
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,450
Okay.
Yeah.

1367
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:36,660
He fucked your mouth.
What's the appointment?

1368
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,590
He fucked your mouth.
He's Kevin Spacey is Kevin's has to guys

1369
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:43,780
to present as you fucked your mom.
Come on.

1370
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:46,600
You went to work or not to start off,
what do you want to do?

1371
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:50,320
What you went to do,
you went to live that isn't offensive.

1372
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,840
Accents,
personable.

1373
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:57,730
I don't even know why you do it because
it doesn't sound like anyone that's ever

1374
00:56:57,731 --> 00:56:59,470
lived.
It's so offensive.

1375
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,600
No ones.
It's not a bad accent.

1376
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,360
It's exactly what someone who doesn't
know how to speak English with Sally.

1377
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:09,070
I would wish that I could speak Arabic
so I could realize how fucking shitty my

1378
00:57:09,071 --> 00:57:13,420
fee bad Arabic would be if I learned
Arabic for a couple of years and tried

1379
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:16,540
to talk to those people.
Make Fun of me.

1380
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:19,360
Go ahead.
I give you full permission to make fun

1381
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:22,540
of an American pretending to be or
trying to speak Arabic.

1382
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,850
Arabic is a very difficult language to
learn.

1383
00:57:24,851 --> 00:57:27,880
Too hard for me to hide my friend,
my friend.

1384
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:30,580
It's so hard.
It's such a rich language compared to

1385
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:33,700
like French Haley.
Give Kevin Spacey a race if he was in

1386
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:35,110
Libya.
If you had a show in Livia,

1387
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,240
Netflix,
Libya would give them a raise

1388
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,320
would go,
this is method duct.

1389
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,200
This is our president would do fuck them
out of everyone.

1390
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:45,034
He can.
Fuck.

1391
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:49,990
This is what I like.
How you are behaving as a president all

1392
00:57:49,991 --> 00:57:53,350
the time.
Go Frank Underwood is a fucking grade.

1393
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:58,440
Just pull out a machine gun.
Shoot through the fucking ceiling just

1394
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:01,570
in the room.
Kiss him on the mouth and Lee's not a

1395
00:58:01,571 --> 00:58:03,940
bad fucking that's,
that's a good,

1396
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:06,630
you play a good Arab desk pot dude.
Who's a pervert.

1397
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:07,810
This,
this is what you'd do.

1398
00:58:07,811 --> 00:58:11,880
You'll fuck every once a month.
Do you have the president will have to

1399
00:58:11,881 --> 00:58:12,820
it.
There's nothing I can do it.

1400
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:16,900
They just get drunk as fuck on,
on booze made out of camel pice.

1401
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:20,650
I take camel piss and they mixed wheat.
Hear about how the president of the

1402
00:58:20,651 --> 00:58:24,220
longtime dictator of Yemen got power.
He was a major in the army.

1403
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,090
Oh,
I'm scared.

1404
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:27,370
He just showed up at uh,
like he was there.

1405
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,290
He was just going to be one of the
majors.

1406
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:33,520
And the president was having a cabinet
meeting and apparently you can look this

1407
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:34,270
up,
Jamie.

1408
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:38,950
Apparently he basically put a briefcase
down or a suitcase down and just pull

1409
00:58:38,951 --> 00:58:41,380
out two guns and went,
well cln or Kush,

1410
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:41,771
Kush,
Kush,

1411
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:42,400
Kush,
Kush,

1412
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,980
and wild.
The entire decapitated.

1413
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:46,540
The government goes,
I'm in charge now.

1414
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,770
Uh Huh.
Uh Huh.

1415
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,590
Uh Huh.
Well you was it.

1416
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:55,200
It's in the 70s you ever see what a
Pistol Grip Uzi looks like?

1417
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:59,410
See you later.
And then he rolled the nation with

1418
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,780
what's called an iron fist for about 30
years.

1419
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:03,970
I'm sure you watched Narcos,
right?

1420
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,910
I certainly have.
How about that fucking show?

1421
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,190
How about Pablo Escobar?
Amazing.

1422
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:14,020
You know what's crazy is apparently
Columbia's bounced back tremendously and

1423
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:15,820
Columbia is like a really cool place to
visit.

1424
00:59:15,821 --> 00:59:17,920
I've heard,
I've had friends who've been there,

1425
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:20,770
I want to go badly,
and that they're most,

1426
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,020
they saved the most beautiful people
voice,

1427
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:26,030
certainly the most beautiful women on
the planet where the famed,

1428
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:30,290
it's just amazing that they bounced back
so quickly from being under control of a

1429
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:30,860
drug,
Lord.

1430
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,600
Yeah.
You know that the Pablo Escobar story is

1431
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:34,610
so goddamn crazy.
It is crazy.

1432
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:37,820
Ladies and gentlemen,
you do not live forever.

1433
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:41,150
Listen to me,
make coke legal.

1434
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:45,410
It'll solve 80% of our problems.
Just make coke,

1435
00:59:45,411 --> 00:59:46,244
legal,
Agri,

1436
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,140
just make coke legal.
I agree.

1437
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,590
Are we really pretending that whiskey is
any better than coke?

1438
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:54,560
We really pretending that.
I don't know coke.

1439
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:56,780
I don't do coke.
Coke is even better cause it's

1440
00:59:56,781 --> 00:59:58,990
devastating quickly.
So you do a lot of cooked.

1441
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,100
You can drink for 40 years and before
you realize you're like,

1442
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:02,840
holy fuck,
I don't have a house or anything else.

1443
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:06,500
Yeah you fucking do below duplo everyday
for three years and come talk to me and

1444
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:07,530
see how your life works at night.

1445
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:12,030
I think that less people would be
inclined to do it if you made it legal

1446
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,720
and then let everybody see the
consequences of its use in a realistic

1447
01:00:15,721 --> 01:00:17,640
way.
I think probably part of the problem

1448
01:00:17,641 --> 01:00:21,750
with things being illegal is that people
can't choose for themselves.

1449
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:25,470
And if people can't choose themselves,
it's forbidden and forbidden things

1450
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:30,440
just like that blank deck back during
the revolutionary war come more tasty.

1451
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,510
They become more test day duck or a
barrier to switching.

1452
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:39,280
I mean that's all forbidden and stuff,
but you can't,

1453
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:41,070
human beings should not be able to tell
it.

1454
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,070
This is the bottom line.
Yeah.

1455
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:46,030
Human beings should not be able to tell
other human beings what they can or

1456
01:00:46,031 --> 01:00:48,490
can't do with their own bodies where it
doesn't make sense.

1457
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,520
It doesn't make sense.
If you have some things that are illegal

1458
01:00:51,521 --> 01:00:55,600
like cigarettes and some things that are
legal like whiskey that I don't have a

1459
01:00:55,601 --> 01:00:57,460
problem with.
Cigarettes being legal and I don't have

1460
01:00:57,461 --> 01:00:59,980
a problem with whiskey being legal and
you should be able do whatever you want,

1461
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,160
but I think it should be with all of the
things like why,

1462
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,500
how come these things right?
Why can't,

1463
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:08,560
you know,
do you telling me that whiskeys legal,

1464
01:01:08,561 --> 01:01:12,460
but mushrooms aren't like that's what
year is this?

1465
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:14,050
What are we doing?
Are we pretending?

1466
01:01:14,051 --> 01:01:17,260
We pretending there's no science.
I we in wishcraft days or no?

1467
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,210
Yeah.
Let me know when the witchcraft days are

1468
01:01:19,211 --> 01:01:21,910
over because I would say witchcraft
should be over now.

1469
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,950
Yeah.
So if it's over now we have to look at

1470
01:01:23,951 --> 01:01:24,940
science.
Right?

1471
01:01:24,941 --> 01:01:25,630
Right.
Yeah.

1472
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:29,880
Okay.
Well you can't let me by oxytocin from

1473
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:34,180
or Oxycontin from the fucking pharmacy.
You can't let go scissor control because

1474
01:01:34,181 --> 01:01:35,920
I stubbed my fucking toe.

1475
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,820
Yeah.
What do you think would happen if we,

1476
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:41,730
we made cocaine legal would win with
consumption.

1477
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:42,541
Go Up.
Yes.

1478
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:43,800
For a little bit.
Yeah.

1479
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,730
A lot of girls would show their inner ho
did let it out.

1480
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:53,040
A lot of dudes and business debt that
they'll never fucking complete.

1481
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:55,200
That's that Joe was that joke.
Cause like when you do cocaine,

1482
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:57,920
you want to start a business together.
The joke,

1483
01:01:58,860 --> 01:01:59,910
funny.
Great Joke.

1484
01:01:59,911 --> 01:02:01,140
It's so true.
So true.

1485
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:04,290
I mean open a doughnut shop.
What the fuck we doing to talk to you

1486
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:06,180
about their passion?
Yeah.

1487
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,600
Passion.
It's a weird drug to be around.

1488
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,050
I was in Jamaica and I,
I don't,

1489
01:02:11,051 --> 01:02:12,600
I'm not a big truck guy,
but I did,

1490
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,080
I did a bag of coke,
a whole bag.

1491
01:02:16,081 --> 01:02:18,720
A guy sold it to me.
I was smoking weed and this guy was

1492
01:02:18,721 --> 01:02:19,201
willing,
we're hanging.

1493
01:02:19,201 --> 01:02:20,050
He goes,
do you ever do blow

1494
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:21,330
was like,
I'm not a big cotton,

1495
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:23,070
not a drug guy.
I don't even smoke weed much.

1496
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:24,270
And he goes,
try this.

1497
01:02:24,271 --> 01:02:27,120
And I did one line of cocaine,
Jamaican cocaine,

1498
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:29,790
and I was like,
this must have fallen off a boat because

1499
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:31,710
this shit's got a yellow little thing to
it.

1500
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:32,670
And I was like,
first of all,

1501
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:34,140
I'm the coolest motherfucker on the
planet.

1502
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:36,420
Second of all,
we're going to play ping pong for good

1503
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:38,070
three hours.
Third of all,

1504
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,010
they're going to go to my fucking hotel
room and I'm going to wake my girlfriend

1505
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:44,130
up and tell her that I'm a genius and
then wait for it.

1506
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,320
I'm going to write for three,
four hours,

1507
01:02:46,321 --> 01:02:49,170
keep doing cocaine,
and I'm going to change my career

1508
01:02:49,171 --> 01:02:53,120
because I'm gonna write a three hour a
bit on how God is a roster foreign.

1509
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,550
How funny is that?
And I wrote stand up and God has Ross

1510
01:02:56,551 --> 01:02:57,750
foreign kept waking my girlfriend,
I'm going,

1511
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,920
I'm writing the funniest shit.

1512
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,370
You're not completed.
She was like,

1513
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:03,540
you wait all this.
And I looked at it,

1514
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,330
then I passed out.
I have to before my heart could give

1515
01:03:06,331 --> 01:03:08,970
out.
And I looked at the shit I wrote about

1516
01:03:08,971 --> 01:03:13,890
eight hours later and it was just,
it was basically God's a roster and he

1517
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:16,470
speaks like a Jamaican.
And that was the joke.

1518
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:19,470
And I thought it was brilliant when I
was fucking doing the blow in the right

1519
01:03:19,471 --> 01:03:21,270
state of mind.
If you captured that idea,

1520
01:03:21,271 --> 01:03:23,190
like if you gave that bit to Dave
Chappelle.

1521
01:03:23,191 --> 01:03:24,750
Sure.
He maybe he could make something.

1522
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,270
Not Brian Calvin.
He's high on cocaine in Jamaica.

1523
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:30,420
It's like you would need to to figure
out what the fuck you were trying to

1524
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:32,940
say.
Like I've written things down on

1525
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:34,340
marijuana and I,
oh,

1526
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,830
I'll figure it out when I'm sober.
But then you try to read it when you're

1527
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:39,870
sober and you're like,
tell the fuck was my point.

1528
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,160
Yeah.
What is the point here?

1529
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:44,460
Yeah,
but they did studies on people on drugs.

1530
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:47,310
I think cocaine and had them play music
musicians and stuff,

1531
01:03:47,311 --> 01:03:49,110
and they were like,
I thought I was amazing.

1532
01:03:49,111 --> 01:03:50,290
And then they listen to what they're
planning.

1533
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:50,640
Like,
Oh,

1534
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,780
what the fuck?
Well,

1535
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:56,340
the Arctic was made.
What killed the music after 1968 it was,

1536
01:03:56,341 --> 01:03:58,050
you know,
the Monterey Music,

1537
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:00,930
I mean rock and roll festival with John
Hendricks and the Mamas and Papas.

1538
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,350
So what,
what,

1539
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,070
what gave birth?
That renaissance was marijuana and

1540
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:06,690
psychedelics.
That that was it.

1541
01:04:06,691 --> 01:04:08,040
That enhance the music.
Oh,

1542
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:10,710
for sure.
Cocaine and heroin came in.

1543
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:12,930
You've got this fucking killed.
It killed it.

1544
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:15,010
People die.
Yes.

1545
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:18,120
Literally Boogie man.
Well,

1546
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:19,890
that was last year.
Some of that shit is good.

1547
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:21,330
Yeah,
there's a lot of good stuff,

1548
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,170
but it's the idea behind that music.
Like how about showgirls?

1549
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,240
Showgirls,
that movie would not exist if it wasn't

1550
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:28,110
for cocaine.

1551
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:31,920
That movie is a Goddamn cocaine movie
that movie's a move where you could see

1552
01:04:31,921 --> 01:04:35,520
the blood coming out of their nose while
they were watching the edit.

1553
01:04:35,521 --> 01:04:37,170
It's like,
keep that in.

1554
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,510
No,
fucking keep that.

1555
01:04:39,511 --> 01:04:43,650
Can you make it longer or flopping in
the pool?

1556
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:44,760
Oh,
it's a terrible movie.

1557
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,330
Duff fucking sex scene between the girl
from saved by the bell.

1558
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,940
What is her name?
Elizabeth something.

1559
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,770
Berkeley Berkeley.
Who was the dude?

1560
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,850
Kyle mcglaughlin clank.
That guy,

1561
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,290
she was on naked who?
She's a very beautiful,

1562
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:02,590
but there's a scene when they were in
the pool where they're making love Brian

1563
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:02,970
Cowen.
Yep.

1564
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:06,840
And if a girl was doing that,
if you are having sex with a girl that

1565
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,420
you were having sex with a girl and she
started doing that,

1566
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,640
you would immediate and I know you,
you're a pervert.

1567
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,500
He would still immediately call a
doctor.

1568
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:16,500
You,
you is perverted as you are,

1569
01:05:16,501 --> 01:05:17,980
as much as you love ladies.

1570
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:23,890
So I got sentenced to be that Kyle
mclachlan golf,

1571
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:27,070
Elizabeth Berkley,
and she's wrapped around and she's

1572
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:31,840
flopping around in the pool.
You would call the police,

1573
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:34,240
call the police.
This is only part of it.

1574
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,370
So this is okay,
I can handle this.

1575
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:40,570
This pitch is getting crazy.
Woo them titties are flopping.

1576
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:41,590
First of all,
if you're calm,

1577
01:05:41,591 --> 01:05:44,680
mclachlan,
walk one couple shoots all over your own

1578
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:46,180
face.
Here's the problem.

1579
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,340
His problem,
she starts flailing.

1580
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,360
Oh cool.
It's like throwing herself back.

1581
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:51,203
Got a call,
the doctor not,

1582
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:54,070
and by the way,
he blew out both his rotator cuffs in

1583
01:05:54,071 --> 01:05:56,530
the scene.
He had to get both of his shoulders

1584
01:05:56,531 --> 01:05:59,360
completely reconstructed.
I only hope you're telling me shut up.

1585
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,270
Fuck that.
He tore his Labor.

1586
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:04,030
Him.
He tore the bicep tendon from the bone.

1587
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:06,910
Goddammit.
She's flopping around like she's dying.

1588
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,300
Go.
You gotta let me know if you're going to

1589
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:13,690
do that.
You can't just them because if you just

1590
01:06:13,691 --> 01:06:16,810
die for like girls just lit.
She's crazy.

1591
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:17,591
Yeah.
You might pray.

1592
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:20,620
Let you a break my dick too,
but foot if I let her die.

1593
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,440
What have you let her die like you
asshole.

1594
01:06:23,441 --> 01:06:24,840
She was having a seizure.
You kept,

1595
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:27,130
you came inside of her.
She was having us

1596
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:29,870
seizure and you came inside of her dude.
What the fuck?

1597
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:35,290
I thought I thought you was just freaky.
You didn't see we have a video of it.

1598
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,710
You didn't see there was something wrong
with her.

1599
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:42,170
You fucking selfish all you care to
problems coming.

1600
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:44,420
Yeah,
she was dying,

1601
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:46,580
man.
She's flipping around.

1602
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,330
She can't breathe.
She hasn't seen anymore.

1603
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:50,580
Oh,
oh,

1604
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,600
oh,
I gotta take it easy.

1605
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:57,440
How can you raping her here?
You're holding onto her.

1606
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,560
You keeping her inside of you.
Just let her go.

1607
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:03,110
There's no way she's trying to just go
on for,

1608
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:03,650
can you get

1609
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:05,030
a whiff of it?
It's just on repeat.

1610
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:05,601
Oh,
sorry.

1611
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:06,950
Get away.
She's trying to get away.

1612
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:07,551
All right,
well,

1613
01:07:07,551 --> 01:07:10,580
congratulations on all that.
There's nothing funny about rape,

1614
01:07:10,581 --> 01:07:12,410
ladies and gentlemen,
but this isn't rape and that's why I

1615
01:07:12,411 --> 01:07:13,221
made a joke.
Okay.

1616
01:07:13,221 --> 01:07:13,990
I'm holding my,
I'm,

1617
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:17,600
I'm like,
it's a joke about something you

1618
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:20,750
absolutely know is definitely not rape
and I'm being ridiculous joke.

1619
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:21,800
Yeah.
Everybody.

1620
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:24,540
It's funny how you to that nowadays in
today's call.

1621
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:25,101
I know,
I know.

1622
01:07:25,101 --> 01:07:25,731
You're ready.
I know.

1623
01:07:25,731 --> 01:07:27,110
You ready to get mad at me.
Don't get mad at me.

1624
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:29,120
Everybody.
We need to stop doing this.

1625
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,120
We need,
we need to figure out what to be so

1626
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:31,920
literal.
Yeah.

1627
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,920
Being so literal.
Start start realizing this with,

1628
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:40,150
we had real problems in the world and
they've Kevin space things about

1629
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,660
example.
I was just trying to be funny about the

1630
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:42,020
Libyan.

1631
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:43,460
Yeah.
Don't let Chapman's basic grab your

1632
01:07:43,461 --> 01:07:44,210
deck.
I get it.

1633
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:45,920
I get it.
I'm not saying that that's not what I'm

1634
01:07:45,921 --> 01:07:49,010
saying.
What I'm saying is we just need to be

1635
01:07:49,011 --> 01:07:54,011
super cognizant of the fact that there
is a real highly likelihood that we have

1636
01:07:54,891 --> 01:07:58,010
achieved the highest level of
civilization the world has ever known.

1637
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:01,040
It's right now,
and we need to be aware of that.

1638
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:02,930
We made progress.
In other words,

1639
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,790
in any massive.
Yeah,

1640
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:09,791
and any seemingly important thing that
you want to go off on.

1641
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,990
You're taking energy away from
recognizing the fact that we need to,

1642
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,510
the crucial elements of this amazing
thing that we have right now,

1643
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:22,850
and one of the things that we have to do
is we've got to avoid this weird

1644
01:08:22,851 --> 01:08:27,230
tribalism that I keep talking about
tribe I thinking because it's not just

1645
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:29,630
sexual,
it's political,

1646
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:33,680
it's socioeconomic.
It's fucking blue collar guy.

1647
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:34,281
And I'm like,
no,

1648
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:35,680
you're a fucking person.
Yeah.

1649
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:36,410
We're all just,

1650
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:37,340
well,
you're in a trap.

1651
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,690
Human beings are,
were,

1652
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:41,300
were genetically predisposed to be
tribal.

1653
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,440
It's US versus them.

1654
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,000
Pass that.
If we're a tribe,

1655
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,230
okay,
we should be tried.

1656
01:08:46,231 --> 01:08:49,040
Planet Earth.
There's famous Ronald Reagan's speech.

1657
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,750
Remember that Ronald Reagan's speech,
he gave a speech,

1658
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,000
I'd want to say it's in front of
Congress,

1659
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:57,780
but he gave a speech where he was
talking about how quickly we would set

1660
01:08:57,781 --> 01:09:00,930
aside our differences if we were
attacked by an alien force from another

1661
01:09:00,931 --> 01:09:01,620
world.
Right.

1662
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:02,890
And all of us would realize,
yeah,

1663
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:06,120
just heat or the Cold War.
I mean this is like look very scary

1664
01:09:06,121 --> 01:09:07,920
times.
Do you remember growing up were the same

1665
01:09:07,921 --> 01:09:10,720
age worried about nuclear war?
We were always worried.

1666
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:15,730
A real threat of nuclear annihilation
was actually something we all thought

1667
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:16,830
about every day.
Yes.

1668
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,010
And the,
the further we're away from that,

1669
01:09:20,011 --> 01:09:21,780
the more we forgot.
And,

1670
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:25,230
but if you just pay attention to Libya,
just pay attention to Afghanistan,

1671
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:28,410
pay attention to Iraq,
pay attention to all sorts of parts of

1672
01:09:28,411 --> 01:09:32,640
the world where North Korea things are
not fucking stable at all.

1673
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:35,970
We are assuming the thing's going to
stay stable because they're stable right

1674
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,550
here,
but we're all on the same God damn

1675
01:09:38,551 --> 01:09:39,370
planet.
Yeah.

1676
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:42,510
And that's a real problem.
It's a real problem.

1677
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:47,160
And I think we're better at figuring
this out than we have ever been before.

1678
01:09:47,161 --> 01:09:49,050
But there's a lot of hiccups and bumps
along the way.

1679
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:51,720
But one of the things it's going to
eliminate a good percentage of them is

1680
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:56,721
if we can isolate tribalism and see it
when it's happening and call it for what

1681
01:09:57,811 --> 01:09:58,830
it is and avoid it.

1682
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:01,100
And it's very,
it's very tough now the tough,

1683
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,400
and I'll tell you why,
because they used to be one of the great

1684
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:08,270
people always was talking about how
religion was responsible for so much

1685
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:09,470
violence,
but they always forget.

1686
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:12,530
Religion was also responsible for a
great deal of unification.

1687
01:10:12,531 --> 01:10:14,300
So there was a national narrative in
this country,

1688
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,100
right?
We were a Christian nation for a long

1689
01:10:16,101 --> 01:10:17,930
time in this country.
And there was a national narrative.

1690
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,160
There were just certain things that
people collectively agreed upon.

1691
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,510
And usually it started in the church,
or at least it had its values in the

1692
01:10:26,511 --> 01:10:28,100
church.
I would argue that,

1693
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:31,460
you know,
even our constitution has been greatly

1694
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:35,370
influenced by the Judeo Christian ethic.
Uh,

1695
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,100
all men are created equal,
for example,

1696
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:38,320
as a Christian idea.
Did you,

1697
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:40,220
there's no way to prove it biologically
are mathematically,

1698
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:42,800
but it's something we all kind of,
it's a nice starting point.

1699
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:45,680
It's literally what our justice system
is predicated on.

1700
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:48,290
All men are created equal.
Even though Lebron James and I have

1701
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:50,930
totally different genomes and he's an
Avatar and we're not equal.

1702
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:53,040
If you kill me,
you kill Lebron.

1703
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:55,400
You do the same amount of time in jail.
Theoretically,

1704
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:57,740
that would be the idea behind our thing.
He should be worth more.

1705
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:59,540
He shouldn't be worth a little bit more
than that.

1706
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:01,610
I would agree.
I would agree.

1707
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:03,710
And,
and what's really interesting is how

1708
01:11:03,711 --> 01:11:06,770
different we are,
how we like all strive not to be equal,

1709
01:11:06,771 --> 01:11:08,150
right?
I want to be better than everybody else,

1710
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:09,950
but we believe in it.
It's a really nice starting point.

1711
01:11:09,951 --> 01:11:11,390
You know,
something that I read that's like really

1712
01:11:11,391 --> 01:11:12,350
important.
I always bring it up.

1713
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:12,440
It's

1714
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:16,950
people that free will or the ability to
do whatever you want.

1715
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:18,000
The uh,
like,

1716
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,660
uh,
a freedom of expression of freedom of

1717
01:11:21,661 --> 01:11:26,661
pursuits breeds inequality.
Because if you give people true total

1718
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:29,130
freedom,
some people are going to try harder than

1719
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:31,500
others.
Some people are going to be a bad thing.

1720
01:11:31,501 --> 01:11:34,080
Some people want to be Tyler Perry and
have a fucking island.

1721
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:34,840
Yeah.
Did the big,

1722
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,390
they remembered.
There's a fundamental difference,

1723
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:37,200
right?
Well Simmons,

1724
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,560
between being American and a communist
and American believes in equality of

1725
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:41,850
opportunity.
I'm not saying we have that,

1726
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:44,610
but that would be the goal.
Then there's equality of outcome.

1727
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,730
The only way to have equality of outcome
is to keep down the people that work

1728
01:11:47,731 --> 01:11:49,320
harder at,
they're smarter and more talented.

1729
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,000
Yeah.
You got to make everybody equal.

1730
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:53,550
That's to me a fundamental evil.
That is,

1731
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:55,620
that's my problem with Marxism.
What the fuck you,

1732
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:59,970
the only way to do this with force,
it's the problem is it's never worked.

1733
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:02,340
No.
I sent everyone worked and it almost

1734
01:12:02,341 --> 01:12:04,230
always leads to like mass murder.
Right,

1735
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:06,660
exactly,
but nobody wants to think that because

1736
01:12:06,661 --> 01:12:08,280
the idea behind is beautiful.
Okay,

1737
01:12:08,281 --> 01:12:12,530
so need to compete.
We should just share money and Sharewell

1738
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:15,750
Pol Pot,
Mao Tse Tung Hitler and Stalin

1739
01:12:15,751 --> 01:12:17,940
dictatorships.
Hitler was more of a fascist.

1740
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:21,270
Yeah.
People also don't realize that the Nazis

1741
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:24,240
were the national socialists.
That's right.

1742
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,630
The real problem with the idea in
execution,

1743
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:32,490
but the idea in the most romantic view
possible is that we don't need to

1744
01:12:32,491 --> 01:12:34,290
compete with each other.
We don't need to be greedy.

1745
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:37,740
And then we could all share resources
and wealth and we all get along and have

1746
01:12:37,741 --> 01:12:40,260
income equality.
But I see this,

1747
01:12:40,261 --> 01:12:45,150
I think it's important to recognize the
thought behind the best version of that.

1748
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,310
Right?
The thought behind the best version of

1749
01:12:47,311 --> 01:12:49,500
that is someone that just really wants
to be an amazing person.

1750
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,210
Right.
And they really want other people to be

1751
01:12:51,211 --> 01:12:53,730
amazing people as well.
I want everybody to be fine.

1752
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,270
They strive for everybody to get along.
So let's just like combine our wealth.

1753
01:12:57,271 --> 01:12:58,740
We don't have to get rich,
delicious,

1754
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:01,230
like provide for the poor.
It's super important.

1755
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,780
Let's like give healthcare to everybody
before anything.

1756
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,130
Hey man,
we don't need the military.

1757
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,120
Let's just relax.
Okay.

1758
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:07,740
You're going to get invaded,
right?

1759
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,250
As a matter of time before the Russian
shows borders.

1760
01:13:10,251 --> 01:13:11,490
Yes.
And they're going to fuck your mouth.

1761
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,470
Yes.
But on that,

1762
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,850
let me pick it back up and doing that
forever.

1763
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:19,080
Remember that the idea of Adam Smith's
idea and the idea behind making money

1764
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,010
was also that when you are rich and when
you were an Aristocrat,

1765
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,960
you have a responsibility to give back
to your community.

1766
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:26,230
That's very,
that was,

1767
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:29,910
that was very much ingrained in the
British sensibility and even in the

1768
01:13:29,911 --> 01:13:32,220
American aristocracy,
like the Kennedy's in this country,

1769
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,590
rich and you have a responsibility.

1770
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:35,341
Correct.
Bill Gates,

1771
01:13:35,341 --> 01:13:38,100
one of the boys,
it'll cases in gendered himself with a

1772
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:40,800
lot of us is that if he does an amazing
amount of charity,

1773
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:41,920
amazing,
amazing,

1774
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:44,670
creative with it too.
And by the way still lives like a

1775
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:47,410
fucking gangster.
It's not even like it's putting a dent

1776
01:13:47,411 --> 01:13:49,060
in his lifestyle.
I mean he's,

1777
01:13:49,061 --> 01:13:51,900
he's helping so many people out with the
Bill Gates Foundation.

1778
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:53,750
That's the same thing.
Warren Buffet gave his kids up,

1779
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,890
now it's up to $7 billion.
He was like,

1780
01:13:55,891 --> 01:13:57,500
go make the world a better place.
And,

1781
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:59,580
and,
and he's got all kinds of charities.

1782
01:13:59,581 --> 01:14:02,220
But that is by all accounts a super
sweet guy.

1783
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,240
Yes,
they're really humble.

1784
01:14:03,241 --> 01:14:05,490
But went back to what you were talking
about about how we're breaking into

1785
01:14:05,491 --> 01:14:09,960
tribes.
I think that we have lost any kind of

1786
01:14:09,961 --> 01:14:11,980
national narrative,
and what I mean by

1787
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,350
that is that people don't even trust
their own institutions with the

1788
01:14:14,351 --> 01:14:16,660
crumbling of any kind of like religious
institution.

1789
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:20,410
It seems that now people are looking
for,

1790
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:24,490
they don't trust main sources of
information so they don't trust most of

1791
01:14:24,491 --> 01:14:27,400
the mainstream media has earned their
shitty reputation.

1792
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:30,320
Cause now it's about clickbait.
Now it's about kind of creating some

1793
01:14:30,321 --> 01:14:31,570
that you want to be first.
Not True.

1794
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:36,580
Being true is not as important as being
the first one with the story and Blah,

1795
01:14:36,581 --> 01:14:37,330
blah,
blah.

1796
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:40,330
I think that there's certainly our
agendas with liberal media,

1797
01:14:40,331 --> 01:14:42,550
conservative media,
they both have their own agendas of shit

1798
01:14:42,551 --> 01:14:43,660
that people do.
Exactly.

1799
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:48,010
So what happens is people,
I think media's favor abilities and the

1800
01:14:48,011 --> 01:14:51,190
single fucking digits or something like
that though among most Americans.

1801
01:14:51,191 --> 01:14:52,930
Let me give you an example of how this
works.

1802
01:14:52,931 --> 01:14:55,630
Sometimes.
I'm somebody who wrote a good article

1803
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:59,050
about the debate that Eddie Bravo and I
had about the world being flat,

1804
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:00,250
but the art,
the,

1805
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:05,370
the title of the article was Joe Rogan
argues with someone about the world

1806
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:06,640
being flat.

1807
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:11,740
So it seems like you saying that the
world is flat,

1808
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,540
so you immediately click it,
but right away the first sentence has,

1809
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:19,660
God bless Joe Rogan,
and then he was in a conversation with

1810
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:22,060
his friend who was arguing with the
possibility and then like,

1811
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:22,781
but like,
okay,

1812
01:15:22,781 --> 01:15:23,830
I see what you did.
Yeah,

1813
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:26,640
I kind of let you hooked him.
You got it.

1814
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:27,680
You did it.
You did it right.

1815
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:29,650
It's okay.
But because of that,

1816
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:31,390
it,
even though it's very insignificant,

1817
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:33,430
a bunch of people have said to me,
bro,

1818
01:15:33,431 --> 01:15:35,140
you used to believe the fucking earth
was flat.

1819
01:15:35,141 --> 01:15:36,160
I saw that.
I was like,

1820
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:38,150
no.
Yeah,

1821
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:41,860
I bet you didn't.
They didn't see CNN and Huffington post

1822
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:43,570
both.
Do they all do that?

1823
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:45,790
I can't stand either one of those.
I think CNN,

1824
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,150
Huffington post started terrible,
but both of them do that.

1825
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:49,720
They,
they'll,

1826
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:50,710
they'll hit you with this.

1827
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:54,850
Like Donald Trump just said one word to
change the entire presidency.

1828
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:58,000
Let me see what the fuck you fuck.
Yeah,

1829
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,430
Dude.
Keith Olbermann is signed off is one of

1830
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,380
my favorite things to watch.
I like him.

1831
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:05,680
He's a,
he's a a spicy character,

1832
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,180
super liberal,
but I liked him anyway.

1833
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,120
We're liberal.
But I think you have to have that look.

1834
01:16:10,121 --> 01:16:13,210
I'm a,
at least who I am right now.

1835
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,840
I'm an open minded,
friendly person that allows for all

1836
01:16:16,841 --> 01:16:17,720
ideas.
Yes.

1837
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,980
Keith Olbermann is as far left as you're
going to get.

1838
01:16:20,981 --> 01:16:22,660
And I liked the fact that he was out
there.

1839
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,960
I think having a wacky dude out there
standing in front of a cable access show

1840
01:16:28,721 --> 01:16:31,780
background with red on one side and blue
on the other.

1841
01:16:31,781 --> 01:16:35,110
And he's got his notes in front of them
and he's wearing a tie and delivers

1842
01:16:35,111 --> 01:16:38,830
these super eloquent like dissertations.

1843
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:41,140
But he's decided he's going to step
away.

1844
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:43,600
And uh,
he said he's retiring from politics

1845
01:16:43,601 --> 01:16:45,130
because he thinks that donald trump's
done.

1846
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:47,380
He'd done it.
He thinks Donald Trump,

1847
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:50,070
he lists a series of things.
Keith Overman,

1848
01:16:50,071 --> 01:16:52,650
it says he's retiring from political
Calamari.

1849
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,840
Yeah.
And he lists a series of things.

1850
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:57,040
Oh,
you're no good for him.

1851
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:59,290
He's a fucking formative.
He knows his shit.

1852
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:01,400
I would not want to debate that guy.
You know what to say.

1853
01:17:01,401 --> 01:17:03,340
She did one dude.
He did one thing though.

1854
01:17:03,341 --> 01:17:06,790
That was pretty fucking stupid.
What was that you knew when that Tomi

1855
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:07,850
Lahren girl,
um,

1856
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:11,450
she,
she's like a conservative hot chick,

1857
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,110
hot white girl with blonde hair.
No,

1858
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:18,620
she put a flag on like,
she was like holding up a flag and a

1859
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:23,621
photo and he wrote something about not,
you shouldn't use the flag that way.

1860
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:29,380
And then Donald Trump Jr tweeted a photo
of the two of them together with her,

1861
01:17:30,171 --> 01:17:34,310
with the flag and keep opening,
then wrapped in a flag and said,

1862
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:36,410
you know something about him being
stupid.

1863
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:39,080
Some,
some funny thing that's also caddy to

1864
01:17:39,081 --> 01:17:42,020
say that it stopped being catty with
this fucking tall ships.

1865
01:17:42,021 --> 01:17:44,600
And I understand you don't like her
because she's a hot girl that's a

1866
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:47,540
conservative and she says ridiculous
shit sometimes and she does.

1867
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:53,020
But like you gotta save your attacks.
You can't throw rocks at every target.

1868
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:57,530
You can't stop for every dog that barks
on the way home or you never get home.

1869
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:00,680
This is why George Washington talked
about the importance of civility.

1870
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:04,130
You need civility if you start attacking
each other.

1871
01:18:04,131 --> 01:18:06,950
If I start,
you know I heard a rumor that Donald

1872
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:09,220
Trump in meetings when he was
negotiating somebody car,

1873
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:10,041
he go,
oh Jesus,

1874
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:11,360
your breath,
holy fuck.

1875
01:18:11,361 --> 01:18:13,670
You get the worst breath and the age
just gets you on your heels.

1876
01:18:13,671 --> 01:18:14,690
He'd be like,
what does it do that?

1877
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:15,620
Yeah,
he apparently,

1878
01:18:15,621 --> 01:18:16,910
that was some of the tactics.

1879
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:19,670
He would just insult you and get you off
your pins.

1880
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:21,980
You're emotional and you're insecure
about your breath.

1881
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,480
Now.
You can't talk as much.

1882
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,900
You know the little techniques.
I think Donald Trump would be super fun

1883
01:18:26,901 --> 01:18:29,900
if he was like your uncle that you were
going to take your girlfriend to when

1884
01:18:29,901 --> 01:18:32,750
you first started dating.
Like say if you dated a girl and it's

1885
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:35,120
like three months in and you're in love
and you're,

1886
01:18:35,121 --> 01:18:36,860
you're parked outside your uncle's house
and like,

1887
01:18:36,861 --> 01:18:38,420
listen,
we're going to spark,

1888
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:41,480
sparked this joint and we're going to go
meet my fucking crazy uncle.

1889
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:44,090
He's beautiful,
he's flawed,

1890
01:18:44,091 --> 01:18:47,690
but he's crazy and don't look at his
hair and we're just going to leave.

1891
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:51,950
And then like
when he talks about himself,

1892
01:18:51,951 --> 01:18:54,710
just seem fascinated and you passed the,
you guys are lucky.

1893
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:59,060
I'm here and you'd go in there so high
that you're barely alive.

1894
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:02,120
So you got like 180 beats per minute.
Your Heart's going.

1895
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:03,640
What are we doing dude?
I,

1896
01:19:03,641 --> 01:19:06,590
I golfed with his caddie,
Obama's caddy.

1897
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:09,980
George W's caddy and Cameron.
I know you golf three times.

1898
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:11,090
Yes.
Thank you very much.

1899
01:19:11,091 --> 01:19:12,320
Three times.
Those guys at the same guy.

1900
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:13,280
The same guy.
Same Guy.

1901
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,490
Same Guy.
Oh caddy for all the one number makes it

1902
01:19:15,491 --> 01:19:17,310
sound like there's three camps.
No,

1903
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:18,460
I wish.
No,

1904
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:19,730
no.
And he said,

1905
01:19:19,731 --> 01:19:23,030
he said Best Golfer in the group,
hands down by far.

1906
01:19:23,031 --> 01:19:24,580
Donald Trump,
he said,

1907
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:26,800
and t they didn't,
doesn't like trump but,

1908
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:31,810
but basically said he's very nice,
very funny and crack them as they looked

1909
01:19:32,571 --> 01:19:33,090
at me,
he,

1910
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:35,090
I didn't think I'm doing.
And Cameron was like,

1911
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:37,310
I think it got to be a lot on your
plate.

1912
01:19:37,311 --> 01:19:40,850
And then apparently he drove by there.
I just club and key largo whenever Mar

1913
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:44,150
Largo and these people were there and he
just bought as they were driving by in

1914
01:19:44,151 --> 01:19:44,984
the car,
he goes,

1915
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,270
you guys have any idea how lucky you
are,

1916
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,890
you're in the best club in the world.

1917
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:51,010
And he just kept driving.
He's,

1918
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,690
he's a very entertaining dude.
I'm,

1919
01:19:52,691 --> 01:19:55,790
I'm a little bummed out at myself that I
didn't do celebrity apprentice.

1920
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:57,080
Really?
Yeah.

1921
01:19:57,081 --> 01:19:59,540
Because uh,
the celebrity apprentice was available

1922
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:03,650
when we were doing the second run,
a fear factor and they asked me to do it

1923
01:20:03,651 --> 01:20:05,330
and I was one of the,
were on NBC.

1924
01:20:05,331 --> 01:20:05,961
I was like,
God,

1925
01:20:05,961 --> 01:20:10,290
I want to move my family to New York for
a few months and like maybe,

1926
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:13,110
and you know,
Mrs Rogan was down for it,

1927
01:20:13,111 --> 01:20:15,450
but I was like,
I don't know if that's a smart move.

1928
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:18,180
It seems like a lot of work for
something that's not really my thing.

1929
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:20,610
I don't,
I don't really want it do it that kind

1930
01:20:20,611 --> 01:20:22,650
of wish I did it.
He has no trump.

1931
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,750
Yeah.
I don't know how well you get to know

1932
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:25,890
them.
Get to know him.

1933
01:20:25,891 --> 01:20:27,190
If you let me hang onto them.

1934
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:29,220
Yeah,
I'm sure he's letting me be close to

1935
01:20:29,221 --> 01:20:31,140
smell you.
I'm sure he'd be a blast.

1936
01:20:31,141 --> 01:20:33,310
I'm sure he'd be a lot of fun because
it's one of those lives.

1937
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:35,400
Maybe I could talk to them to fix
things.

1938
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,470
Maybe we could just tell him to just
take it down a notch.

1939
01:20:37,471 --> 01:20:38,850
It would be okay.
He's not interested in,

1940
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:41,190
the problem with him is that he's not
interested in what he doesn't know.

1941
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:42,130
I,
that's how I feel.

1942
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:45,440
Maybe I feel like we could have a sit in
with homeboy.

1943
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:47,420
Yeah.
Just to just him.

1944
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,530
You get him on his podcast,
come out.

1945
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:51,870
It's wearing him out.
Just relax.

1946
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,760
Relax.
He never drinks.

1947
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:56,460
It doesn't course that's the problem.
It's part of the problem.

1948
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:59,790
Like you need a separation from the
normal states of consciousness.

1949
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:02,340
Otherwise you're acting on momentum your
entire life,

1950
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:03,810
so you like a child.

1951
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,090
They did it.
They did a psychological profile that I

1952
01:21:06,091 --> 01:21:07,980
thought it was interesting on him,
which was that he's always been on the

1953
01:21:07,981 --> 01:21:11,040
outside.
So his dad wasn't allowed to be part of

1954
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:14,460
the developers in New York.
He had to go elsewhere and he was always

1955
01:21:14,461 --> 01:21:17,160
kind of like kept out.
And he is now in the media.

1956
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:18,520
So his way of,
uh,

1957
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:22,540
and I think Roy Cohn,
the infamous lawyer,

1958
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,740
um,
was his mentor and said,

1959
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:28,440
attack,
always attack to meet any threat with an

1960
01:21:28,441 --> 01:21:30,180
attack.
He listened to the reason why he's

1961
01:21:30,181 --> 01:21:34,350
president is because Obama mocked him at
the press corps conference.

1962
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,620
Remember that?
Remember that press corps dinner meeting

1963
01:21:37,621 --> 01:21:40,050
thing?
And Obama mocked him and said,

1964
01:21:40,051 --> 01:21:41,610
I'm one thing that you're never going to
be.

1965
01:21:41,611 --> 01:21:43,710
And that's the president.
And he's go,

1966
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,903
oh,
for real?

1967
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:46,950
Yeah,
I'm fucking older than you knew.

1968
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:48,570
Can I lock?
I'm ridiculous.

1969
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,580
Look at my hair and I'm still going to
be the president.

1970
01:21:50,581 --> 01:21:52,980
How about you go fuck yourself?
How about you don't know what you're

1971
01:21:52,981 --> 01:21:55,200
dealing with here?
How about he was amazing.

1972
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:56,670
He was so amazing.
And the debates,

1973
01:21:56,671 --> 01:21:58,410
he was so entertaining.
It was funny.

1974
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,600
And even George.
Jeff Bush said,

1975
01:22:00,601 --> 01:22:02,250
you can't insult your way to the White
House,

1976
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:03,550
my friend.
Yeah,

1977
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,710
you can't change.
You can,

1978
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:06,510
you definitely can.
When you're fighting.

1979
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:08,010
Look,
it's like what's,

1980
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:12,520
what's really ironic is one of the
things that's come out to over turn your

1981
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:17,040
notes things both punters I don't,
but I do know about is talking shit,

1982
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,730
I'm good at talking shit and I
understand the strategies behind talking

1983
01:22:20,731 --> 01:22:22,800
shit.
And one of the strategies behind talking

1984
01:22:22,801 --> 01:22:26,790
shit was that Hillary felt very
confident that if she could get donald

1985
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:30,240
into a position of being the primary
candidate against her,

1986
01:22:30,241 --> 01:22:33,750
she would have an easy path to the White
House because she felt like Donald was

1987
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:38,751
so ridiculous that there the other
candidates by even being associated with

1988
01:22:39,241 --> 01:22:41,310
him in the same party,
there would be revolt.

1989
01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:44,610
It would be chaos.
And if he won he'd be an easy target.

1990
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:49,080
And there's all this like written banter
back and forth where she was trying to

1991
01:22:49,081 --> 01:22:51,780
connect him with the most ridiculous
people.

1992
01:22:51,781 --> 01:22:52,531
Like,
of course,

1993
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:53,550
you know,
there was a,

1994
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:58,560
there's just all this like strategy with
Ted Cruz where they had this idea of how

1995
01:22:59,050 --> 01:23:00,810
they would make them all look,
marginalize,

1996
01:23:00,811 --> 01:23:01,950
easy path,
the White House,

1997
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:04,470
and he just threw a monkey ridge

1998
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,170
right into that theory.
It's like stupid.

1999
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:10,210
I'm the worst person for you to argue.
I'm going to say,

2000
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:12,490
I'm going to say you should be in jail.
Lock her up,

2001
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:16,990
lock her up,
and I'll make shit up to make up my own

2002
01:23:16,991 --> 01:23:17,950
facts.
If I have to,

2003
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:22,780
I'll do whatever I want and I'll get
caught on tape talking about how girls

2004
01:23:22,781 --> 01:23:24,250
just let you grab him.
The Pussy.

2005
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,020
Yeah,
just a few weeks out.

2006
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:27,190
Yeah,
no problem.

2007
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,250
It was locker room talk.
Not a problem.

2008
01:23:30,251 --> 01:23:31,660
Let's talk about uranium.
Dude,

2009
01:23:31,661 --> 01:23:33,190
I thought he was done when I heard that.
I thought,

2010
01:23:33,191 --> 01:23:34,850
oh,
he's definitely done no precedent.

2011
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:36,970
By the way.
What's really shocking?

2012
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:40,900
What was it?
44% of the white women voted for him

2013
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:43,510
because they want that Dick.
Well,

2014
01:23:43,511 --> 01:23:45,280
they weren't that.
They weren't that offended by it,

2015
01:23:45,281 --> 01:23:46,400
I guess.
Right.

2016
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:49,210
This is a lot of women right now that
just shut off this podcast.

2017
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:52,090
You fucking asshole.
Right when I was starting to think you

2018
01:23:52,091 --> 01:23:54,220
weren't an asshole.
It's just comedy.

2019
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:57,610
I don't really think that 44%.
I think people didn't like Hillary.

2020
01:23:57,611 --> 01:24:01,090
They didn't trust her.
I think if you looked at what it is in

2021
01:24:01,091 --> 01:24:02,500
terms of like,
um,

2022
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:07,470
like good versus evil,
it's known evil versus unknown,

2023
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:08,570
you know,
it was,

2024
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:10,990
I think it's unknown.
He's known evil or known corruption

2025
01:24:10,991 --> 01:24:15,310
versus a sideshow.
Like sort of a guy who's going to be

2026
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:17,890
really entertaining for the next four
years but probably won't bring the

2027
01:24:17,891 --> 01:24:20,500
republic down.
But what if he decides to really look

2028
01:24:20,501 --> 01:24:23,290
out for the American people?
What if he decides to make America great

2029
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:25,030
again?
What if he decides to bring back

2030
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:30,330
engineering and bring back production of
goods and fucking what if he decides

2031
01:24:30,611 --> 01:24:33,490
that?
What if you really decided that then is

2032
01:24:33,491 --> 01:24:34,390
it better to take a chance?

2033
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:36,250
And I think a lot of people did that.
I agree.

2034
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:39,160
And then I also think we were realizing,
and we should,

2035
01:24:39,161 --> 01:24:42,250
this is something we need to all come to
grips with.

2036
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,630
It is irrational,
illogical,

2037
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:51,070
nonsensical,
an antiquated to have one person have

2038
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:53,470
that much power in the United States of
America.

2039
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:56,260
It is nonsense.
It's not something we need.

2040
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:57,820
It is a,
it's a,

2041
01:24:57,850 --> 01:25:01,690
it's a value system and a ruler
leadership system that's designed for

2042
01:25:01,691 --> 01:25:04,090
small groups of people and it works very
well,

2043
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:07,900
works very well for groups of hundred
and 50 people at leaves over their

2044
01:25:07,901 --> 01:25:12,400
dicks.
But as soon as you get to 320 million

2045
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:14,970
people all trapped together on a
landmass,

2046
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:19,900
you cannot have one dip shit that's good
at insulting people and standing in

2047
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:22,660
front of a camera.
I don't care if it's him or the next guy

2048
01:25:22,661 --> 01:25:24,580
or the,
it's on a assault on Donald Trump.

2049
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:29,580
It's like one person who figures out a
way to fucking manipulate and dance and

2050
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:32,830
do his best.
America's got talent,

2051
01:25:32,831 --> 01:25:35,020
fucking preppers,
a presentation,

2052
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:36,760
presentation,
representation.

2053
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:39,430
One of those things to get to the point
where people go,

2054
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:41,320
ah,
the other lady's boring and she keeps

2055
01:25:41,321 --> 01:25:43,210
fainting.
Boom and they kill.

2056
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,310
They hit the switch for trump.
I mean,

2057
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:50,350
one of the things that president always
talks about and governors talk about is

2058
01:25:50,351 --> 01:25:52,120
how little power they have.
You say that,

2059
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:55,960
but there's real problems right now with
the environmental protection agency

2060
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:58,690
being defunded.
There's real problems right now with

2061
01:25:58,691 --> 01:26:02,200
them deciding to start drilling in
places in Alaska that people have been

2062
01:26:02,201 --> 01:26:04,370
fighting for them for decades

2063
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:06,960
because they're worried that in
extracting minerals from the ground,

2064
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:09,080
they're going to ruin these salmon
waterways.

2065
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:09,890
Well,
he can eat,

2066
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:12,590
he can hit mine judges and he can,
he can appoint judges.

2067
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:17,390
You do a lot of things and obviously
that cost is a big stir in political

2068
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:19,760
discourse and people being active and
it's,

2069
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:24,320
you're seeing like some trans woman
going to a got elected somewhere and gay

2070
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:27,500
people are getting elected papers and so
you're seeing a a rebound,

2071
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:28,910
which is what?
How does that work?

2072
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:29,850
That's right.
He's,

2073
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:33,800
he's created a lot of civic unrest and a
lot of civic organization on the other

2074
01:26:33,801 --> 01:26:34,850
side.
On the other side.

2075
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:36,320
Yeah.
David from us talking about that.

2076
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:37,340
He is.
Yeah,

2077
01:26:37,341 --> 01:26:40,490
he just sent me his book.
We just have to be really careful,

2078
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:44,300
like really careful of getting tribal
with this.

2079
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:44,970
Again,
I can't,

2080
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:46,670
can't,
I hate to reiterate this,

2081
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,120
but I think that in looking at the group
of humans as a whole,

2082
01:26:50,121 --> 01:26:52,850
there's a real problem that on the left
and on the right,

2083
01:26:52,851 --> 01:26:57,290
people have with getting attached to
their particular ideology they've

2084
01:26:57,310 --> 01:27:01,280
adopted and fighting against anything
that's any different and not coming to

2085
01:27:01,281 --> 01:27:05,660
some sort of a common understanding of
what we really need to get by in this

2086
01:27:05,661 --> 01:27:06,110
plant.

2087
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:07,460
It's called,
it's called a couple of things.

2088
01:27:07,461 --> 01:27:11,210
One is there are different psychological
profiles and I've heard Jordan Peterson

2089
01:27:11,211 --> 01:27:13,680
talk about sort of like the left is
rooted in compassion and the right is

2090
01:27:13,681 --> 01:27:18,681
rooted in respect for the strong.
And then what happens is the way things

2091
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:23,900
move forward is you have an idea.
I have an idea and remember something,

2092
01:27:23,901 --> 01:27:25,790
it's very important.
Human beings,

2093
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:28,460
uh,
usually are weighing two values and

2094
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:30,530
their head at one time.
Let me give you an example.

2095
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:34,940
I don't believe in illegal immigration,
but I have a lot of compassion for

2096
01:27:34,941 --> 01:27:36,760
people who are dying to get over the
board.

2097
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:39,470
If I was a border control agent,
I would probably be the guy who was

2098
01:27:39,471 --> 01:27:40,940
like,
come on and cause I have no,

2099
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:41,970
I'm emotional,
right?

2100
01:27:41,971 --> 01:27:44,840
Doesn't mean that's right.
What it means is that I can sometimes

2101
01:27:44,841 --> 01:27:46,820
you way to values in your head,
right?

2102
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:51,850
Mercy and compassion versus justice and
fair play.

2103
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,780
Okay,
let me propose something to you.

2104
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,540
Now,
this is gonna sound crazy for a lot of

2105
01:27:56,541 --> 01:28:00,440
people that were you.
A full could call me at one point in

2106
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:03,350
time.
I believe in the future we will not have

2107
01:28:03,410 --> 01:28:06,220
boundaries in terms of places you're
allowed to travel,

2108
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,190
not to travel,
right?

2109
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:11,780
One point in time people would truly be
thought of as equal and when that point

2110
01:28:11,781 --> 01:28:14,210
in time happens,
you'll allow people to freely travel all

2111
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:16,220
over the world.
Why can't we do that now?

2112
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,350
First of all,
you won't even have to travel.

2113
01:28:18,351 --> 01:28:21,860
I think what's going to happen is when
you can interface with another brain and

2114
01:28:21,861 --> 01:28:22,840
that's,
that's possible,

2115
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:26,600
you're going to have an experience about
what it's exactly what it's like to be a

2116
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,430
woman.
Exactly what it's like.

2117
01:28:28,431 --> 01:28:29,750
By the way.
It can be a woman.

2118
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:31,790
I'm going to take it.
I want to be a woman so I can see what

2119
01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:33,860
it's like to have sexual Lebron James,
but here's the thing,

2120
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,970
what if she would you complain,
which you put your hands on her hips.

2121
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,130
I will.
I'm only going to,

2122
01:28:40,131 --> 01:28:45,131
I'm going to be able to experience it so
then if I could interface with another

2123
01:28:45,171 --> 01:28:48,050
brain,
now we got a real problem because what

2124
01:28:48,051 --> 01:28:49,820
the fuck does that mean about my
identity?

2125
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:52,730
What if they can't?
Like you can't pick what brand new

2126
01:28:52,731 --> 01:28:55,460
interface with like you're going to be a
girl out sex with a little broad james,

2127
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:59,300
but you're a 100 pound Irish girl like
shit.

2128
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:01,090
Oh boy.
You Ain't get your uterus blown.

2129
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,010
You know?

2130
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:06,180
Yeah.
Like you want like 178 pound chick from

2131
01:29:06,181 --> 01:29:09,120
Ecuador that can really take it.
I don't think any of that's going to

2132
01:29:09,121 --> 01:29:10,100
happen.
I think what's going to happen.

2133
01:29:10,101 --> 01:29:13,890
So you can have guys like Lebron James
who had these fantastic lives who have

2134
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:18,150
sex and dunk basketballs and they're
gonna sell their experience.

2135
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,850
You want to interface with my brain,
it's going to cost you this much money

2136
01:29:20,851 --> 01:29:23,770
and that is going to be the new drug.
Oh my God,

2137
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:27,450
the new drug is going to be,
I want to see what it's like to be

2138
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,010
either,
you know,

2139
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:32,160
whoever it is,
the Brian James and will rise again.

2140
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:34,620
Correct.
Dennis Robin will rise from the flames

2141
01:29:34,621 --> 01:29:38,520
like a fucking phoenix.
Be the number one superstar again in the

2142
01:29:38,521 --> 01:29:39,690
world.
And when you watch porn,

2143
01:29:39,691 --> 01:29:42,670
you're going to be able to tap into the
guy's brain and you're gonna be,

2144
01:29:42,671 --> 01:29:43,800
I'll have sex with anybody you want.

2145
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,140
So that's how you thinking about Dick.
Just like he is.

2146
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:51,240
Imagine that unless you pay your head
your favorite over to Dick and like,

2147
01:29:51,241 --> 01:29:52,770
hey,
he's thinking about Dick.

2148
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,900
This is a confusing,
why am I coming on?

2149
01:29:54,901 --> 01:29:57,570
I'm thinking about God,
but ah,

2150
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,520
Shit.
Dammit.

2151
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:03,160
People get mad at your yoga and money.
Dick by that Brian Calla video.

2152
01:30:03,161 --> 01:30:04,920
All the fucking homeboys got a giant
Dick.

2153
01:30:04,921 --> 01:30:08,130
But he's thinking about dudes bugs all
the time the way,

2154
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,270
but he folks a little hubs,
girls,

2155
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:12,060
doesn't matter man.
While he's fucking all the hottest girls

2156
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,830
digging about dude's butts.
Hold on.

2157
01:30:13,831 --> 01:30:14,340
Dope,
Bro.

2158
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:17,120
Did you come or not?
Came immediately.

2159
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:21,390
Immediately I came like a terrorist
wearing a wig in my mind.

2160
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:25,590
I came like a dude strap with dynamite,
getting his dick sucked for the last

2161
01:30:25,591 --> 01:30:27,140
time.
Ooh.

2162
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:32,850
It could give me and I took the
headphones off like,

2163
01:30:32,851 --> 01:30:34,950
fuck you Brian Cowen.
Dammit.

2164
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:38,220
He's fucking the hottest girls.
But took it about dude's butts.

2165
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:40,080
If friends and be like,
man,

2166
01:30:40,081 --> 01:30:41,370
I don't even know if he's telling the
truth.

2167
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:45,030
I've been holding out for the Bryan
count,

2168
01:30:45,031 --> 01:30:47,790
virtual reality sex video.
But now god,

2169
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:49,850
he's so medium and white.
I don't want to think about Duke,

2170
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,080
right?
I know.

2171
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:53,340
Oh,
I told you I had a dream.

2172
01:30:53,341 --> 01:30:54,560
I was gay,
right a couple of times.

2173
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:56,940
Sorry about that.
On a podcast before or after you had gay

2174
01:30:56,941 --> 01:30:57,774
sex,
uh,

2175
01:30:57,850 --> 01:31:00,480
this was during,
so I don't know if that makes sense.

2176
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:05,730
Dream I was game of gay in my dream.
I was like,

2177
01:31:05,731 --> 01:31:08,910
I can't believe I'm gay.
This is so not what I'm into.

2178
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,780
And then I knew I was going to have to
have sex with my boyfriend who may or

2179
01:31:12,781 --> 01:31:13,860
may not have been Brendan Shop.

2180
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:14,970
I can't remember.
It was a big guy,

2181
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:17,610
a gate.
You can't really bounce back and forth

2182
01:31:17,611 --> 01:31:19,800
from,
I don't know man.

2183
01:31:19,801 --> 01:31:24,801
I've actually never really had a gay,
we didn't talk to fattiest Russell,

2184
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:28,860
cause he'll tell you you're a liar.
And then all men have some sort of gay

2185
01:31:28,861 --> 01:31:31,860
fantasy somewhere deep in their head or
35 years,

2186
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:36,861
daddy has had a conversation about truth
and versus like plural truths versus one

2187
01:31:37,231 --> 01:31:39,090
fixed truth.
That's a huge debate.

2188
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:42,870
You know what I mean by that?
So like Nicha,

2189
01:31:42,871 --> 01:31:44,470
what would be the guy to talk about?
Plural truth.

2190
01:31:44,471 --> 01:31:47,160
So if you look up at a painting,
that painting,

2191
01:31:47,161 --> 01:31:48,270
is there different truths,
right?

2192
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,100
One is that painting's beautiful and
that's all I know.

2193
01:31:50,101 --> 01:31:50,990
It's a beautiful item.
It,

2194
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,560
it affects me emotionally.
That's the truth.

2195
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:54,330
Right?
Then a chemist would look at that

2196
01:31:54,331 --> 01:31:54,931
painting and say,
well,

2197
01:31:54,931 --> 01:31:58,320
you're not really seeing yellow.
What you're seeing is you know your eyes

2198
01:31:58,321 --> 01:32:00,220
are,
are at light and then reflect.

2199
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,990
There's a chemical in there and he'd
break down a chemical.

2200
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:05,000
That's a different layer to truth.
You're saying different kinds of true

2201
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:06,400
love,
right?

2202
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:08,840
So true love.
I don't know what the,

2203
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:11,560
that's still a really an interesting
mystery to me because I wonder if that's

2204
01:32:11,561 --> 01:32:14,710
a relationship with yourself.
So sometimes you're obsessed with

2205
01:32:14,711 --> 01:32:15,251
somebody,
right?

2206
01:32:15,251 --> 01:32:17,620
You love them.
You might be obsessed with the idea of

2207
01:32:17,621 --> 01:32:19,940
being the one that can break them.
That can be the one that,

2208
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:21,310
that,
that tames them,

2209
01:32:21,311 --> 01:32:24,880
the one that owns them,
the one that you know gets them to

2210
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:27,670
forget about all of the Dick and just
yours.

2211
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,730
That's,
that's what a lot of relationships are

2212
01:32:30,731 --> 01:32:33,250
predicated on.
This terror doesn't notion of

2213
01:32:33,251 --> 01:32:34,300
territoriality,
right?

2214
01:32:34,301 --> 01:32:36,070
But does that true love,
is that what we're talking about?

2215
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:37,320
Does it matter?
But,

2216
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:40,420
but does,
what really matter is the moments where

2217
01:32:40,421 --> 01:32:41,470
you are together.

2218
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:44,470
We truly care about each other,
where the intensity is almost

2219
01:32:44,471 --> 01:32:48,010
overwhelming and the love.
And the happiness to be with each other.

2220
01:32:48,011 --> 01:32:50,440
It's almost overwhelming.
That is really true.

2221
01:32:50,441 --> 01:32:55,441
Love all the other set of state though.
And how long does it last?

2222
01:32:55,630 --> 01:32:58,180
That's a good question.
And whether or not you're committed to

2223
01:32:58,181 --> 01:33:01,930
that person as a love,
not just a love interest,

2224
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,340
but like as a,
uh,

2225
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:08,760
an inhabitant in your,
your realm of truly loved ones.

2226
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:13,300
Like what is your,
your village of Trans Cynical answer for

2227
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:14,021
you on that.
So,

2228
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:16,900
so I know what the Greek says.
So why do you love your children?

2229
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:18,790
Why?
What is it about your children that you

2230
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:20,740
love?
And this is what socrates said.

2231
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:22,600
There's kind of an interesting way of
looking at it.

2232
01:33:22,601 --> 01:33:24,820
So he said love,
difficult to define.

2233
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:27,070
You have to define it as love of
something.

2234
01:33:27,090 --> 01:33:29,710
Right?
And what is the one thing man loves more

2235
01:33:29,711 --> 01:33:31,870
than anything else?
Think about it.

2236
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:34,740
Post it,
not close pussies.

2237
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:38,200
Part of it was these may be a
manifestation of what you're trying to

2238
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:40,060
Ken from it.
What is it?

2239
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,650
Come on attention.
Why would you breed a,

2240
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:45,350
you want to get rid of Jews,
goddammit.

2241
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:46,690
Goddammit,
keep going.

2242
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:49,780
You got to think deeper bro.
Like I needed to think the next level.

2243
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,210
Why?
What is it the man loves more than

2244
01:33:52,211 --> 01:33:53,890
anything else?
What does he want more than anything

2245
01:33:53,891 --> 01:33:55,060
else?
I don't know.

2246
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,010
What does he want you to tell me?
In mortality,

2247
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:59,080
you want to live forever.
Exactly.

2248
01:33:59,081 --> 01:34:00,940
What puts you at the gateway wherever
with no plus

2249
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:06,220
kids and your kids are your genetic
expression.

2250
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:10,570
Anybody worth a fuck do you,
do you want to live forever with no

2251
01:34:10,571 --> 01:34:15,571
pussy forever or live for a hundred
years and just live like Jay z on a

2252
01:34:16,361 --> 01:34:19,090
yacht and gold underwear with is
dangerously.

2253
01:34:19,091 --> 01:34:20,150
I want to live dangerously.

2254
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:24,370
You want to live dangerously?
Not Safely.

2255
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:24,950
Fuck,
fuck.

2256
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:26,260
A thousand years old.
100 years.

2257
01:34:26,261 --> 01:34:28,270
I'm excited.
So what you're saying about any

2258
01:34:28,271 --> 01:34:31,780
mortality is horse shit cause the
mortality without pussy is nonsense.

2259
01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:34,210
Immortality is represented in different
things.

2260
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:37,150
Wash legacy.
Listen to me sweetie.

2261
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:40,240
Yeah.
If someone is in my circle of friends

2262
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:44,500
and somebody offers you in mortality
with no pussy or a hundred years and

2263
01:34:44,501 --> 01:34:47,380
pussy,
if you don't take choice number two,

2264
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:49,090
lose my number.
But hold on,

2265
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:49,960
hold on,
stop.

2266
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:51,780
Stop texting her.
I can't work with you.

2267
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:57,210
I would argue that your love of pussy
might be genetically like you've evolved

2268
01:34:57,711 --> 01:34:58,160
to

2269
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,540
that.
Your love was he is.

2270
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:04,370
Is your love of Pussy because you
ultimately want to spread and further

2271
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:05,450
your DNA?
Well,

2272
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:07,370
first of all,
I think it would be very disrespectful.

2273
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,660
You as particularly,
oh,

2274
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:09,510
of course.
Giant.

2275
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:12,470
I met Vagina.
I'm talking about sexual relationships.

2276
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:16,020
What about the gay folk?
Gay Folk wouldn't want to be and then

2277
01:35:16,030 --> 01:35:17,840
assess to actually instead of sex.
Yeah.

2278
01:35:17,841 --> 01:35:19,910
Instead of calling it pussy because the
gay folk would be like,

2279
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:21,050
hey man,
I'm with you,

2280
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,150
but you're excluding me.
I'm one 10th of the population.

2281
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:25,300
Allegedly not one 38% corn.
Sandy.

2282
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:27,180
Yes.
Russell Thaddeus.

2283
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:31,070
It's what he says.
He's head of dudes get hard and they see

2284
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:32,890
dudes getting the good stuff.
Fucking do that.

2285
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,220
That's not true.
That's not true.

2286
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:35,270
He didn't say that.
He didn't say it.

2287
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:35,990
I like that.
Yes.

2288
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:36,823
Yeah,
me too.

2289
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:41,960
But I think that the idea of not being
in a sexually pleasurable relationship

2290
01:35:43,591 --> 01:35:46,020
with someone for all of eternity,
that sounds stupid.

2291
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:50,730
First of all this he had said they do
with men and women in longterm

2292
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:52,310
relationships.
You know what the secret was?

2293
01:35:52,311 --> 01:35:53,900
The long term,
the West and there were C,

2294
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:56,510
they fucked.
They had a deep sexual connection.

2295
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,730
Get the talk out of here that talked to
me.

2296
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,070
I'm just friends with you.
We have a deep friendship.

2297
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,740
You want to,
you should want to fuck the person you

2298
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:04,900
should want to.
Fuck I heard,

2299
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:07,550
but successful marriages are like that.
Yeah.

2300
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:08,490
Why you make it?
This is noise.

2301
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:11,830
This is what you do and your fuck right?
Fingers and noises.

2302
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:13,800
That's all.
Fuck no,

2303
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:14,634
I don't do that.
I go,

2304
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:17,580
I go and I do a lot of slicking back
here.

2305
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,870
Ooh,
Ooh,

2306
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,160
Ooh,
Ooh.

2307
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:25,850
That's an idea.
That's what I do.

2308
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:28,040
That's what she does on.
In all honesty,

2309
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:31,310
if you had a choice between living like
a hermit,

2310
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:32,840
like all bullshit aside,
no jokes,

2311
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,780
living like a hermit,
living like someone who occasionally

2312
01:36:35,781 --> 01:36:39,620
interacts with people but doesn't have
any real deep connection with them or

2313
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:44,750
living like you're in like a wonderful
community of people that you care about

2314
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:49,400
and drinking and carrying on.
And hugging each other and laughing and

2315
01:36:49,401 --> 01:36:51,620
joking around and waking up,
hung over and getting breakfast

2316
01:36:51,621 --> 01:36:53,060
together,
and you live for a hundred

2317
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,800
you want me to get an intellectual?
Want you to know you're talking about

2318
01:36:54,801 --> 01:36:55,770
that right now?
You know the question.

2319
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:56,560
Now you know you're,
you're,

2320
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,170
you know,
you're,

2321
01:36:57,170 --> 01:36:59,120
you know what this distinction you're
drawing my friend.

2322
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:02,330
What can I get philosophical on you?
The distinction between socrates and

2323
01:37:02,331 --> 01:37:04,010
Nichi,
socrates said,

2324
01:37:04,011 --> 01:37:08,360
a man should have quiet contempt for his
body and ultimately learn to be a

2325
01:37:08,361 --> 01:37:11,990
complete template of human being.
Just be a brain and your body is

2326
01:37:11,991 --> 01:37:13,250
nothing.
As he was dying,

2327
01:37:13,251 --> 01:37:14,150
he drank the hemlock.
He said,

2328
01:37:14,151 --> 01:37:17,270
why are you guys crying?
I'm living in a shitty shell and it's

2329
01:37:17,271 --> 01:37:20,690
all gross and I'm going onto a better,
I'm going to be in the sky with all the

2330
01:37:20,691 --> 01:37:22,340
great philosophers and neat.
She goes,

2331
01:37:22,490 --> 01:37:23,330
yes,
socrates.

2332
01:37:23,331 --> 01:37:27,290
You said that because you are ugly,
you never got laid.

2333
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:31,220
So of course you want to negate and you
turn reason into a tyrant.

2334
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:33,440
And he said,
all those seven deadly sins of the

2335
01:37:33,441 --> 01:37:35,960
Christians talk about like,
like pride.

2336
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:37,070
There's another words,
right?

2337
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:41,840
It's called self esteem.
Self esteem is a good thing and lost.

2338
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:43,880
Yeah.
Sex is a lot of fun.

2339
01:37:43,881 --> 01:37:46,400
Even though he never had sex,
but literally he never had basically

2340
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:47,570
never got laid.
They even think,

2341
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:48,321
yeah,
he might,

2342
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:50,960
they think he either got syphilis and
that's why I died and went crazy.

2343
01:37:50,961 --> 01:37:52,520
Or he was gay.
Either way.

2344
01:37:52,521 --> 01:37:54,110
He never got laid.
He had a giant mustache.

2345
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:55,740
Bring up Nietzsche and take a look at
his mustache.

2346
01:37:55,741 --> 01:37:56,100
He's talking

2347
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:59,550
about masks.
He had a crazy mustache or code if if

2348
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:00,330
need.
She was gay.

2349
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:02,260
Brilliant motherfucker.
But he talked about there'll be able to

2350
01:38:02,261 --> 01:38:05,040
make your life a circus and a work of
art and joy,

2351
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:09,690
everything and live dangerously.
Don't be fucking in a mountain when

2352
01:38:09,691 --> 01:38:11,370
you're in a mountain meditating.
It's awesome.

2353
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:13,650
But guess what?
You're not really engaged in the world.

2354
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:14,880
I wish she was gay.
Well,

2355
01:38:14,881 --> 01:38:17,490
look at that because there's so many
statutes.

2356
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:22,200
There's so many dudes that are like,
like real aggro sort of Wall Street type

2357
01:38:22,201 --> 01:38:23,970
guys that are pro Nietzsche.
Yeah,

2358
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:27,050
it'd be awesome if Nietzsche was just
like the whole time we was talking,

2359
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:27,811
hey,
you're ugly.

2360
01:38:27,811 --> 01:38:28,470
I'm thinking,
well,

2361
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:29,670
good looking guys.
Cox.

2362
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:33,020
Hopefully that's not the only
conventional ways.

2363
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:34,680
This is the noise.
I want you to think about him making

2364
01:38:34,681 --> 01:38:38,490
behind the spectacles and with this
beautiful mustache with a suit on.

2365
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,620
He's doing this.
As soon as they stopped the camera,

2366
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:43,740
thinking about Dick,
don't get,

2367
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:47,520
you're being stereotypical.
He's not licking his lips slurping.

2368
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:48,500
You don't know.
Look at them,

2369
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:51,630
but look at that face I,
that would be a Dick slurp and type face

2370
01:38:51,631 --> 01:38:54,000
things whistle through his mustache when
he says fuck,

2371
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:56,020
maybe that's why he has that mustache in
the first place,

2372
01:38:56,021 --> 01:38:59,480
so dude's can just really grab it and
get all four fingers

2373
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,840
like this problem.
Nippy late his lips,

2374
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:05,760
small discussion.
Those are lip handles.

2375
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:10,970
He could grab a hold of them and wrap
them handled Zinger and then use it to

2376
01:39:11,641 --> 01:39:14,860
just like push down on the shaft.
Lady.

2377
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:15,960
Man,
I don't want to apologize.

2378
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:18,450
I want to pause.
Check those unique.

2379
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,810
Why else would you grow mustache in your
face?

2380
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:26,220
He was basically sick his whole life.
He was sick and told like that many

2381
01:39:26,221 --> 01:39:27,054
dicks.

2382
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:30,030
You suck a lot of Dixie lose weight.
I don't know if that's true.

2383
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:31,380
Cough a lot,
sir.

2384
01:39:31,381 --> 01:39:33,710
I don't know Dick Handle on his upper
lip.

2385
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,110
A lot of girls have that.
Why else would you grow a Dick Handle on

2386
01:39:37,111 --> 01:39:39,630
your upper lip?
Because he's hiding behind his mustache.

2387
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:40,890
Oh,
so sensitive.

2388
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,020
What about a full beard?
Like fucking animal?

2389
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:45,330
It's interesting.
Some dude in special forces,

2390
01:39:45,331 --> 01:39:48,960
it's kind of a neck handkerchief on
those necker shifts.

2391
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:51,000
That was part of his,
that was his scars.

2392
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:52,470
That was part of his,
uh,

2393
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:56,670
special forces for mask.
Why do so many of those don't look real?

2394
01:39:56,671 --> 01:40:01,350
Badass ass guys have those crazy,
uh,

2395
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,960
like things around their neck.
Oh,

2396
01:40:03,961 --> 01:40:04,591
uh,
you mean?

2397
01:40:04,591 --> 01:40:05,490
Um,
eh,

2398
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:09,120
those ropes are how those uh,
Bandana type thing.

2399
01:40:09,121 --> 01:40:10,560
Do you want to know?
They're like scarves.

2400
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:12,600
I gotta I have to answer why.
Okay.

2401
01:40:12,601 --> 01:40:13,434
Ready.
Go ahead.

2402
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:18,060
I know this from my buddy Rudy Raz,
who was a recon guy and saw a lot of

2403
01:40:18,061 --> 01:40:19,290
action.
They did generation kill.

2404
01:40:19,291 --> 01:40:21,140
So why do you wear those things?
Why?

2405
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,490
Why do you wear a scarf?
Here's why.

2406
01:40:23,491 --> 01:40:24,200
Ready,
Dude,

2407
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:25,200
I'm ready for this.
And Hey,

2408
01:40:25,201 --> 01:40:27,000
all you operators out there,
please forgive me.

2409
01:40:27,001 --> 01:40:31,610
I had never done any but just but just
indulge me and all due respect as I'm,

2410
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:33,810
if I'm here and I'm shooting,
okay,

2411
01:40:33,811 --> 01:40:34,241
boop,
up,

2412
01:40:34,241 --> 01:40:34,710
up,
up,

2413
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:36,450
and you're next to me.
Where am I?

2414
01:40:36,451 --> 01:40:38,190
Shells gone.
They're fucking hot.

2415
01:40:38,910 --> 01:40:42,630
They're spitting out.
And when nutshell lands in your neck and

2416
01:40:42,631 --> 01:40:45,380
gets under your shirt.
It burns like a motherfucker and Avu

2417
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:46,550
buzzy.
No.

2418
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:49,460
So you cover your neck.
When you're in a firefight month,

2419
01:40:49,630 --> 01:40:51,450
you cover your neck.
Oh,

2420
01:40:51,451 --> 01:40:56,070
so you were that you open mother fucker
up getting Marchenko style.

2421
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:59,050
You're talking now you're [inaudible]
burn marks all over your body.

2422
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:01,360
All over.
I'm like little fucking rain.

2423
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:03,700
Teardrops rolling down your chest.

2424
01:41:07,370 --> 01:41:08,620
How about me?
And I've got to stop.

2425
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:11,350
When I went to Afghanistan,
when I went to do standup at

2426
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,110
Afghanistan,
oh,

2427
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,020
I've got to say I wore one of those and
the,

2428
01:41:15,021 --> 01:41:16,750
and the special forces guy,
we're in the truck,

2429
01:41:16,751 --> 01:41:17,590
he goes,
take that off.

2430
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:18,610
I go,
why?

2431
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:21,150
Because if we hit with an IED or face is
going to catch fire,

2432
01:41:21,151 --> 01:41:26,151
her mother
cotuit used to wear one of those and I

2433
01:41:26,251 --> 01:41:28,630
was like [inaudible].
Yeah,

2434
01:41:28,631 --> 01:41:29,920
that's a sign of what a bad
motherfucker.

2435
01:41:30,010 --> 01:41:31,690
Randy Cooke tourists.
He thinks he's going to walk around with

2436
01:41:31,691 --> 01:41:33,070
a scarf on.
He's a ranger too,

2437
01:41:33,071 --> 01:41:35,020
wasn't he?
Wasn't he in the military is definitely

2438
01:41:35,021 --> 01:41:36,880
in the army.
He learned to box in the army,

2439
01:41:36,910 --> 01:41:40,540
look at them
things all over the place.

2440
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:45,400
He says shit about it to action.
He could wear addition on his head and

2441
01:41:45,401 --> 01:41:47,980
still he signs a new five scarf deal.

2442
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,650
Oh,
what years this scarf deal sounds like

2443
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:53,750
it's,
it might be click on it and it real.

2444
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:57,160
He really,
he's a handsome magazine.

2445
01:41:57,161 --> 01:42:00,100
I guarantee this ain't a joke.
What year is this?

2446
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,410
We use,
this article's from January of this

2447
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:03,011
year.
Oh really?

2448
01:42:03,011 --> 01:42:04,600
Yeah.
Oh that old.

2449
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:06,070
Less than a year.
Do you remember?

2450
01:42:06,071 --> 01:42:07,660
You and I,
we were like 28 years old.

2451
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:08,531
Do you remember?
You and I.

2452
01:42:08,531 --> 01:42:10,960
When we first saw him,
Joe and I first saw him,

2453
01:42:10,961 --> 01:42:13,540
we were at the UFC and he was standing
there and we were like,

2454
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:14,710
wait,
let me snuck up.

2455
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:17,020
When we were looking at him and he had a
big bond,

2456
01:42:17,021 --> 01:42:19,210
his knee was like,
he has a weird knee and then we like,

2457
01:42:19,211 --> 01:42:21,540
his legs are skinny compared to his
body.

2458
01:42:21,570 --> 01:42:23,620
We were like assessing.
We were taking him down.

2459
01:42:23,621 --> 01:42:27,070
We were looking at his whole body,
but we were like two teenage girls

2460
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:28,180
looking at a rock star.

2461
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:30,610
I never forgot.
That really is days,

2462
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,520
dude.
You and I went to one of the earliest

2463
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:34,060
ever UFC is when I was like,
dude,

2464
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:36,400
I can't work for these people anymore.
I was like,

2465
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:37,870
what am I doing?
It was like,

2466
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:40,720
it was just calm.
Are you calling me saying you were going

2467
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:42,310
to announce it?
UFC?

2468
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:43,450
I remember you saying,

2469
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,380

I was like,

2470
01:42:44,381 --> 01:42:47,120

The fucking people that worked for news

2471
01:42:47,130 --> 01:42:49,170
radio,
like the production people really like

2472
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:50,710

I was like,

2473
01:42:50,711 --> 01:42:52,960
yeah,
I'm going to go to Alabama to do this

2474
01:42:52,961 --> 01:42:54,820
UFC thing.
It's a cage fighting.

2475
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:58,180
They looked at me like I was going to
watch like animal porn.

2476
01:42:58,181 --> 01:42:59,940
That's right.
I was going to watch some chicks sucks

2477
01:42:59,941 --> 01:43:02,110

Dick's and bunch of dudes get fucked by

2478

mules and like that's like literally,
I know.

2479
01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:05,621
They were like,

2480
01:43:05,621 --> 01:43:06,400
you're ruining your life.

2481
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:08,770
And I was like,
I'm not gonna fight you.

2482
01:43:08,771 --> 01:43:10,600
And I were asked.
I remember that.

2483
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:12,310
Yeah,
they have to figure out who's the best

2484
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:15,310
can I have to fight?
I remember meeting or looking at

2485
01:43:15,311 --> 01:43:18,920
Bustamante and you said,
what's his first name or low morale

2486
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:20,860
boost Manta and he's just,
he's six,

2487
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:24,610
four and he was at a food,
there was like a food laid out and I and

2488
01:43:24,611 --> 01:43:25,750

01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:27,640
that guy's one of the best Jiu Jitsu
guys in the world.

2490
01:43:27,641 --> 01:43:29,830
And I looked at him,
he had that jaw and I was just like,

2491
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:31,940
God,

or we used to train across my full head
of hair.

01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:45,640
He sure does.

2498
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:47,680
He's starting to go though.

2502
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,850
called me up.
I was the same way.

2503
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:58,850
I just,
I did Artie Lang's radio show and

2504
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:01,980
rounded off as you get older.
I had a sharp nose.

2505
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:03,990
Skinny fucking neck.
Yeah.

2506
01:44:03,991 --> 01:44:05,480
It's weird.
Like I'm a thick guy now.

2507
01:44:05,481 --> 01:44:07,700
When we first met,
we were both skinny.

2508
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:13,330
We're both like a 27 maybe.
I had breakfast with Brendan shop this

2509
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,670
morning and I came fresh,
fresh,

2510
01:44:16,671 --> 01:44:19,220
my Olympic lifting class,
you know I Olympic lift now,

2511
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:20,930
right.
And my testosterone.

2512
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:22,580
Look how,
look at Hackett.

2513
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:27,660
You
see if you get me and Brian Count

2514
01:44:28,221 --> 01:44:29,630
together.
When Brian was the pool boy.

2515
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:30,980
Dude.
You know what's really sad about that

2516
01:44:30,981 --> 01:44:32,810
picture?
I thought I was kind of tough back then.

2517
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,320
You're always a sweet guy.
No,

2518
01:44:36,321 --> 01:44:37,490
but I mean,
in my mind I was like,

2519
01:44:37,491 --> 01:44:38,440
I'm a black belt in taekwondo.

2520
01:44:38,450 --> 01:44:40,820
I wrestled in high school.
A sad story.

2521
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:43,910
I remember when we first met man,
we immediately had so much in common.

2522
01:44:43,911 --> 01:44:45,590
We started talking about martial arts.
Like what?

2523
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:47,400
You didn't take one doe?
What?

2524
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:49,370
You're a comedian.
What?

2525
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,990
Yup.
What happened to that check?

2526
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:52,670
What was her name?
Well,

2527
01:44:52,671 --> 01:44:55,280
when you said [inaudible] box and you do
Jujitsu and you have to,

2528
01:44:55,281 --> 01:44:56,690
cause you'd be in jail.
Otherwise I went.

2529
01:44:56,691 --> 01:45:00,050
All that guy speaks to my life.
We're both retards.

2530
01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:01,480
Both the pit bulls.
There you go.

2531
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:02,940
There's Brian.
Look at you.

2532
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:06,740
It's you fucking look at the dancing.
Look at you.

2533
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:10,400
Look at that.
I was doing pushups to where's her?

2534
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:11,810
Uh,
she,

2535
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:13,520
what is her name again?
Mary.

2536
01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:15,530
Um,
oh my God.

2537
01:45:15,531 --> 01:45:17,920
I can't believe I'm forgetting her name.
She's so,

2538
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:20,360
she's the most talented woman I've all
fucking funny.

2539
01:45:20,361 --> 01:45:22,580
I'll tell you that.
She's incredible.

2540
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:23,570
Fuck's her name,
man.

2541
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:25,340
I really can't believe I'm forgetting
Mary's name.

2542
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:29,130
Jamie.
Find finding me so lucky.

2543
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:31,730
You like a baby.
Look at you.

2544
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:34,670
How weird is that dude that this thing,
someone captured time?

2545
01:45:34,890 --> 01:45:37,280
I,
this actually really happened with us.

2546
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:41,890
I know.
We were actually there at us in 94 dixie

2547
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:46,130
westward to find out what her name is.
Manoj feel disrespect Mary Mary,

2548
01:45:46,131 --> 01:45:47,500
I'm so sorry.
I'm,

2549
01:45:47,501 --> 01:45:48,500
I'm,
we're going to find it.

2550
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:51,140
I'm 50 and I'm senile.
Oh my God.

2551
01:45:51,141 --> 01:45:54,230
If you smoked weed,
that's what it is.

2552
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:57,020
That's what it is.
You bastard.

2553
01:45:57,530 --> 01:46:00,020
Terracing myself.
We're doing a wonderful job of

2554
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:01,490
entertaining people.
She's incredible.

2555
01:46:01,491 --> 01:46:02,630
She's one of them.
She was,

2556
01:46:02,631 --> 01:46:07,631
I was always in awe of her talent.
She's an awesomely funny Mary masterson.

2557
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:10,040
No,
but that's patriarchy.

2558
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:13,060
Son asked her woman,
we have to smash the city.

2559
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:13,943
Park is here.
Back.

2560
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,220
Last name,
master woman.

2561
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:19,730
How can we get up masterson can even at
masterman.

2562
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:21,770
Yeah.
Masterman yeah.

2563
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:24,773
Dammit.
Eris Scheer.

2564
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,020
I'm so back to Mary.
She was very funny.

2565
01:46:27,310 --> 01:46:29,090
She's incredible.
That was a great character.

2566
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:31,760
She had to I,
she was one of those people that was so

2567
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:33,670
talented like I could,
she write shit and,

2568
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:37,100
and she would figure out what was wrong
with a sketch and I would be sewing all

2569
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,680
I did,
but then she was a groundling forever.

2570
01:46:39,681 --> 01:46:41,240
I didn't know.
I was like,

2571
01:46:41,241 --> 01:46:42,470
Oh,
you've been doing this forever.

2572
01:46:42,471 --> 01:46:45,860
Like I did.
Never done scratch specific type of

2573
01:46:45,861 --> 01:46:46,760
comedy.
Yes.

2574
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,590
You know,
it's very different doing sketches.

2575
01:46:48,591 --> 01:46:50,130
Very.
It's very different animal than doing

2576
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,960
stand up.
She,

2577
01:46:51,961 --> 01:46:54,420
she was ridiculously funny.
Yeah.

2578
01:46:56,340 --> 01:47:00,420
It's weird form of comedy,
you know those sketch little short

2579
01:47:00,421 --> 01:47:01,620
things,
writing them every week.

2580
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:03,440
You know,
that's the craziest thing about Saturday

2581
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,980
night live.
But yeah,

2582
01:47:04,981 --> 01:47:07,770
like the Chappelle show and a lot of
these other shows,

2583
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:11,250
they had time to develop these sketches
and they weren't doing them all in front

2584
01:47:11,251 --> 01:47:14,760
of a live audience like night live does.
I have friends who've gotten Saturday

2585
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:16,410
night live and that is grueling
schedule.

2586
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:17,430
They're up all night,
man.

2587
01:47:17,570 --> 01:47:18,870
Kind of an idea.
It seems like,

2588
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:22,110
well at least coming from Phil Hartman's
explanation of it,

2589
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:24,590
he said it was very like competitive.
Oh yeah.

2590
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:26,700
The point where people got real hostile
with each other.

2591
01:47:26,701 --> 01:47:29,040
It's just,
it was never like a relaxed,

2592
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:30,580
fun environment.
Like,

2593
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:35,040
in fact when he first came from Saturday
night live and came over to news radio,

2594
01:47:35,041 --> 01:47:39,000
one of the things what he was like a
little standoffish at first and then

2595
01:47:39,001 --> 01:47:42,000
eventually he like realizes like,
oh these people aren't competing with

2596
01:47:42,001 --> 01:47:42,930
me,
we're not competing.

2597
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:44,470
Right.
It took a while though really?

2598
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:45,201
But yeah,
yeah,

2599
01:47:45,201 --> 01:47:47,850
yeah.
There was like an environment of snl

2600
01:47:47,851 --> 01:47:50,940
that was like super like hyper
competitive and Michael's wants it to be

2601
01:47:50,941 --> 01:47:52,560
that way.
You have to compete to get your sketch

2602
01:47:52,561 --> 01:47:54,990
on and if you don't,
you you go away.

2603
01:47:55,410 --> 01:47:57,720
And so it's a very competitive
atmosphere.

2604
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:01,200
You could see it and felt like fit.
And Phil just relaxed after a while he

2605
01:48:01,201 --> 01:48:02,550
relaxed and I'm like,
no,

2606
01:48:02,551 --> 01:48:02,760
no,
no,

2607
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:05,130
we're not competing like you're Phil
Hartman.

2608
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:07,020
I'm some fucking dude that nobody even
knows.

2609
01:48:07,021 --> 01:48:07,560
Yeah.
Okay.

2610
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:08,850
And were both on a show together.
Hey,

2611
01:48:08,851 --> 01:48:09,684
what's up?
Yeah.

2612
01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:10,681
And he's like,
Oh okay,

2613
01:48:10,681 --> 01:48:11,490
okay,
okay.

2614
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:14,460
And then he like,
I got deeper and deeper to know him.

2615
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:16,560
You know,
this is back in my non weed smoking

2616
01:48:16,561 --> 01:48:17,400
days.
Unfortunately.

2617
01:48:17,401 --> 01:48:20,860
I wish I smoked weed cause he used to
love to smoke weed and yeah,

2618
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:21,420
yeah,
yeah.

2619
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:23,340
He would,
he would smoke weed after shows and wind

2620
01:48:23,341 --> 01:48:26,130
down and play music and go to strip
clubs and shit.

2621
01:48:26,190 --> 01:48:29,580
He does impossibly funny.
He was a really interesting guy.

2622
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:31,170
But you're not like any guy I've ever
met.

2623
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:33,180
Like legitimately not like any guy I've
ever met.

2624
01:48:33,181 --> 01:48:38,130
Like he had an incredibly unique way of
viewing opportunities and things.

2625
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:40,770
One of the things that happened is he
didn't really make it until he was quite

2626
01:48:40,771 --> 01:48:42,150
old,
you know,

2627
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:43,350
in terms of grounding.
Right.

2628
01:48:43,351 --> 01:48:44,920
Or is the second city,
I think it was brown.

2629
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:48,390
I think he was cracking city.
He might've been groundling too.

2630
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:51,960
I think you might be right.
But I know he was also an artist and he

2631
01:48:51,961 --> 01:48:54,840
did peewee's playhouse.
He did something with peewees play,

2632
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:55,703
uh,
you know,

2633
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,240
pee wee herman or an artist like a
painter.

2634
01:48:57,270 --> 01:48:57,691
Yeah,
no,

2635
01:48:57,691 --> 01:48:59,520
he needs to make album covers and stuff.

2636
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:00,140
Yeah.
It was like a,

2637
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:02,400
like a legit graphic artist.
Wow.

2638
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:04,170
Yeah.
He's a fascinating guy.

2639
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,270
Like when we first did a news radio
together,

2640
01:49:06,271 --> 01:49:08,370
he just decided that he wanted to get
his pilot's license,

2641
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:11,160
so every time I talked to him,
homeboy and have his pilots book out and

2642
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:14,310
be going over his fucking pilots book
and going like he was constantly have it

2643
01:49:14,311 --> 01:49:15,750
on the set,
like in between scenes.

2644
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:18,930
He would do a scene and they would open
up as pilots book and just as obsessed

2645
01:49:18,931 --> 01:49:20,730
with learning how to fly a plane.
My Dad?

2646
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:23,370
Yeah,
my father,

2647
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:25,590
my father was obsessed with that.
He got his pilot's license.

2648
01:49:25,591 --> 01:49:26,730
I never got it.
I was like,

2649
01:49:26,731 --> 01:49:28,830
I don't know why you care that much.
Well,

2650
01:49:28,831 --> 01:49:29,611
you know what it is,
man.

2651
01:49:29,611 --> 01:49:30,990
It's freedom.
It's like,

2652
01:49:31,170 --> 01:49:34,290
especially a guy,
obviously I can say this now since his

2653
01:49:34,291 --> 01:49:36,510
wife killed him,
he had a bad relationship.

2654
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:41,030
When you have a bad relationship,
you just want to fly these kids too and

2655
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:42,030
I want to,
I don't even know.

2656
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:44,130
I don't know.
I don't know.

2657
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:47,410
Horrible store.
That was a worst.

2658
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:49,000
I remember talking to you right after
it.

2659
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,370
Again,
this is another thing where it was a

2660
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:54,370
disassociative.
It was a psych psych medicine.

2661
01:49:54,371 --> 01:49:58,030
It was zoloft mixed with cocaine.
Not saying that she wouldn't have done

2662
01:49:58,031 --> 01:50:00,340
that without anything.
Not saying that the drugs are

2663
01:50:00,341 --> 01:50:02,260
responsible,
but I'm saying it's,

2664
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:06,280
it's eerie.
How many different violent episodes are

2665
01:50:06,281 --> 01:50:08,500
connected to psych medication.
God,

2666
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:12,370
yeah.
We are fucking with the very way that

2667
01:50:12,371 --> 01:50:16,450
your brain interfaces with reality.
To think that that doesn't have

2668
01:50:16,451 --> 01:50:18,970
consequences is absurd.
It's absurd.

2669
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:22,130
It's absurd.
And to think that you can sort of poo

2670
01:50:22,131 --> 01:50:25,270
poo those consequences,
like correlation is not causation.

2671
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:27,160
Okay,
you're right,

2672
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:29,050
you're right.
But have you done a study to find out

2673
01:50:29,051 --> 01:50:31,030
what's what,
or have you really dug into it?

2674
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:32,980
Have you looked into these people?
If you find out what they were like,

2675
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:36,170
is there a way to even back engineer
their personality before you start

2676
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:37,900
adding drugs?
Is there a wet,

2677
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:39,610
like,
do you know what the difference between

2678
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:43,030
depression and psychotic madness's?
I don't know.

2679
01:50:43,630 --> 01:50:46,780
I'm not.
And I think obviously the people like

2680
01:50:46,781 --> 01:50:47,710
the guy,
the vegas shooter,

2681
01:50:47,711 --> 01:50:48,700
nobody knew,
right?

2682
01:50:48,701 --> 01:50:50,320
If nobody knew and he just did that.
So there's a,

2683
01:50:50,321 --> 01:50:52,390
there's a line that he can cross.
Well,

2684
01:50:52,391 --> 01:50:55,210
he's capable of doing that.
You don't know what that line killed

2685
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:56,080
himself.
Point is.

2686
01:50:56,170 --> 01:50:58,100
We're not dealing with an exact science.
Yeah.

2687
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:01,370
We're dealing with something that vary
so widely.

2688
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:05,980
This for anyone has suggested dosages,
depending on how you react to it.

2689
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:09,250
Only reason why people are saying it's
fine cause they make money from it.

2690
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:11,560
That's it.
They didn't make money from it.

2691
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:12,161
They'd be like,
well blah,

2692
01:51:12,161 --> 01:51:12,401
blah,
blah,

2693
01:51:12,401 --> 01:51:12,641
blah,
blah,

2694
01:51:12,641 --> 01:51:12,941
blah,
blah,

2695
01:51:12,941 --> 01:51:14,500
blah.
How many people are being prescribed?

2696
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:15,220
What?
Yeah,

2697
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:17,440
why?
How did you try exercise?

2698
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:18,580
You didn't,
okay,

2699
01:51:18,670 --> 01:51:20,470
so you just took a pill.
You're eating sugar all day and you just

2700
01:51:20,471 --> 01:51:22,240
took a pill.
Now everything's supposed to go check

2701
01:51:22,241 --> 01:51:23,290
your hormones.
Did you do,

2702
01:51:23,291 --> 01:51:24,870
did you do anything other than that?
Yeah.

2703
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:27,820
The thyroid medications.
Try Meditation.

2704
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:30,610
Did you try exercise?
Did you try jogging?

2705
01:51:30,670 --> 01:51:31,900
I want you to try jogging for six
months.

2706
01:51:31,901 --> 01:51:33,030
It will give you the pills.
Yeah,

2707
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:35,530
but can you,
but then again,

2708
01:51:35,531 --> 01:51:37,120
is that hypocritical?
Shouldn't,

2709
01:51:37,150 --> 01:51:39,280
if I think coach should be legal,
should I shouldn't,

2710
01:51:39,281 --> 01:51:41,110
I think that people should be able to
take a pill.

2711
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:42,031
Well,
I think your,

2712
01:51:42,031 --> 01:51:45,510
your objection to that is that there's
an entire industry making lots of money

2713
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:49,870
and making claims about those psychotic
drugs,

2714
01:51:49,890 --> 01:51:51,890
those drugs,
psychosomatic,

2715
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:56,730
whatever the word is,
drugs that may be in many cases are not

2716
01:51:56,731 --> 01:51:59,430
true.
I'm sure that things like PROZAC and

2717
01:51:59,431 --> 01:52:03,120
Zoloft have their place.
I'm sure they work for some people.

2718
01:52:03,121 --> 01:52:05,250
I know.
In fact I have family members that

2719
01:52:05,251 --> 01:52:08,040
really do well with Xanax.
I do as well.

2720
01:52:08,041 --> 01:52:11,340
And I know,
I know it's just like weed is good for

2721
01:52:11,341 --> 01:52:13,080
some people and other people can't
function.

2722
01:52:13,081 --> 01:52:15,780
I can't really function on marijuana
talk a pretty good right now.

2723
01:52:15,810 --> 01:52:18,600
Thank you.
But I yes I am but,

2724
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:22,110
but for the most part,
it depends on your chemistry in your

2725
01:52:22,111 --> 01:52:23,880
body.
But I think what you're objecting to is

2726
01:52:23,881 --> 01:52:26,370
that there is people who get there,
people are getting very,

2727
01:52:26,371 --> 01:52:28,980
very wealthy.
Certainly companies on,

2728
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:31,040
on,
uh,

2729
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:34,650
claims that are not measurable and not
always true.

2730
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:35,930
There's that.
Right.

2731
01:52:35,930 --> 01:52:39,290
But there's also the same reason why I
don't think a 900 year old dude should

2732
01:52:39,291 --> 01:52:42,420
be able to fuck a 50 year old lady cause
it thinks she's basically like a phobia.

2733
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,790
This is what I think.
I think that people are goddamn

2734
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:46,580
vulnerable

2735
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:50,210
and gullible and when you have these
commercials where there's people walking

2736
01:52:50,211 --> 01:52:53,780
down the street and art cartoon
butterflies are flying around and

2737
01:52:53,781 --> 01:52:56,870
they're all jolly and you're selling
antidepressants and then you start

2738
01:52:56,871 --> 01:53:01,040
listing off be explosive,
anal bleeding,

2739
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:04,790
heart blown out of your fucking chest,
like the alien movie,

2740
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,860
Your Dick Falls off,
your feet go numb,

2741
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:10,730
you start reading off this thing while
you're showing the same cheerful

2742
01:53:10,731 --> 01:53:15,731
environment and crazy music.
I think that alone shows you that

2743
01:53:16,581 --> 01:53:18,950
there's a problem.
Just those commercials alone,

2744
01:53:18,951 --> 01:53:21,140
the fact that they exist,
the way they're structured,

2745
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:26,410
the fact that they have to say all these
horrific side effects for like a minute,

2746
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:30,290
two minutes of the commercial,
it's a horrific side effect.

2747
01:53:30,530 --> 01:53:34,400
A giant like if you have like
legitimately have and what is commercial

2748
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:38,900
30 seconds.
It's entirely possible that 15 of those

2749
01:53:38,901 --> 01:53:41,600
30 seconds are going to be the
consequences of you taking this drug

2750
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:46,490
while you're looking at cartoon bunny
rabbits and week flying through the air

2751
01:53:46,491 --> 01:53:50,630
and everybody's smiling and there's a
bunch of whistles and fucking piano and

2752
01:53:50,631 --> 01:53:52,820
it seems like everybody's having a grand
old time.

2753
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:55,280
Yeah.
And they're talking about death and

2754
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:59,630
suicidal thoughts.
It's psychotic episodes and come on.

2755
01:53:59,631 --> 01:54:02,270
Do you want a really good insight into
how big Pharma works?

2756
01:54:02,271 --> 01:54:05,930
Read Ben Goldacre is but pig farmer,
fucking bad farm.

2757
01:54:05,931 --> 01:54:10,100
I think it's called just money.
And it's the same thing as all of it.

2758
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:14,120
It's tribalism because if you could look
at your team,

2759
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:17,960
your pharmaceutical team as being you
against everybody else,

2760
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:22,550
you could figure out a way to sell fuck
up drugs to people that you really

2761
01:54:22,551 --> 01:54:24,620
shouldn't be selling it.
I just have to say you want to make

2762
01:54:24,621 --> 01:54:28,790
money cause we're doing this podcast
that my entire act right now,

2763
01:54:28,791 --> 01:54:32,390
my new hour is all about this and
everybody who's seen me that knows that

2764
01:54:32,391 --> 01:54:34,000
this is true.
That's what I want to say this.

2765
01:54:34,001 --> 01:54:35,450
Cause you're talking about teens and
tribalism.

2766
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:38,690
The theme of my fucking next hour is,
is exactly this,

2767
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:40,010
how we break up into teams.

2768
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:42,980
So I just don't want anybody to think
that my next hour has been influenced by

2769
01:54:42,981 --> 01:54:45,920
this fucking podcast cause I love that
you're thinking about the same thing.

2770
01:54:45,921 --> 01:54:47,810
I am.
I think a lot of people were thinking

2771
01:54:47,811 --> 01:54:50,960
about this now because as we were
running into this weird situation where

2772
01:54:50,961 --> 01:54:52,960
we realized that,
you know,

2773
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:56,650
our democracy is in some weird way,
uh,

2774
01:54:56,780 --> 01:55:00,720
being examined that's being fractured
isn't happening.

2775
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:01,573
Sure.
There's a lot,

2776
01:55:01,730 --> 01:55:03,760
but it's been examined by people.
Yeah.

2777
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:07,130
They're looking at it from all sorts of
different angles in an unprecedented

2778
01:55:07,131 --> 01:55:08,000
manner.
Right.

2779
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:11,720
And we're looking at the influence that
Russia might have had and all this

2780
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,040
Bernie Sanders was going to run in 2020.
There's,

2781
01:55:13,130 --> 01:55:16,160
there's so much going on right now
that's this intense,

2782
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:21,640
incredibly high level that we're all
sort of like caught up in this thing

2783
01:55:21,950 --> 01:55:24,370
trying to figure out what's,
what's going to happen next.

2784
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:26,000
Also,
it's also we're having really trouble

2785
01:55:26,001 --> 01:55:28,530
trouble knowing what to believe.
Right?

2786
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:30,860
I mean,
we don't know what to believe and what

2787
01:55:30,861 --> 01:55:31,521
to believe in.
I mean,

2788
01:55:31,521 --> 01:55:32,690
is this a Bot?
And,

2789
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:34,280
and what,
what is twitter?

2790
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:36,350
I mean,
if six people are saying you did

2791
01:55:36,351 --> 01:55:39,600
something and that's it in the why,
what,

2792
01:55:39,610 --> 01:55:42,350
how true is this?
And if the stories are all remarkably

2793
01:55:42,351 --> 01:55:44,160
similar now some consistencies,

2794
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,300
I he,
Charlie rose,

2795
01:55:45,630 --> 01:55:46,680
but what,
what do we do?

2796
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:51,800
It's very interesting time because trans
privacy privacy is dead yet we still

2797
01:55:53,461 --> 01:55:56,780
don't really know what to believe.
I mean,

2798
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:58,560
I,
I'm getting information from six

2799
01:55:58,561 --> 01:56:01,470
different sources.
So who's actually telling me the truth

2800
01:56:01,471 --> 01:56:05,190
about that person or that event?
Um,

2801
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:08,070
that's the biggest.
That's to me.

2802
01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:11,150
And that was one of the biggest shit.
And when you add that to click baiting

2803
01:56:11,151 --> 01:56:14,040
as it gets real,
it gets to be a real create cynicism and

2804
01:56:14,041 --> 01:56:18,470
it creates paranoia and it creates the
idea that I can't rely on any,

2805
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:20,930
the institutions I used to be able to
rely,

2806
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:22,830
rely on.
And there's also been an observed

2807
01:56:22,831 --> 01:56:24,960
strategy of really,
um,

2808
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:27,840
inflated headlines that get altered
later.

2809
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:28,621
Yeah.
You know,

2810
01:56:28,621 --> 01:56:30,120
they say something completely
ridiculous.

2811
01:56:30,121 --> 01:56:31,740
It's not really represented by the
facts.

2812
01:56:31,741 --> 01:56:34,320
And then they tone it down when people
complain,

2813
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:36,060
but they got all the initial hits.

2814
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:37,800
That's when I first novus notice doing
that.

2815
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:42,950
You can sway a vote by saint floating
things anonymously and then by the time

2816
01:56:43,081 --> 01:56:45,810
it comes out that it's bullshit.
Well you,

2817
01:56:45,870 --> 01:56:50,700
you've lost what's also dirty to name
stuff after important values like the

2818
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:51,790
Patriot Act.
Of course.

2819
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:54,370
Fuck.
How do you vote against the Patriot and

2820
01:56:55,110 --> 01:56:56,580
patriot?
Patriot.

2821
01:56:56,581 --> 01:56:58,410
Exactly.
Like that's rude.

2822
01:56:58,560 --> 01:56:59,790
Of course.
That's rude.

2823
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:00,960
That's a root,
dirty trick.

2824
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:03,690
Somebody should have pointed that out.
Someone David from,

2825
01:57:03,691 --> 01:57:06,240
they had any balls like there was on the
Senate floor.

2826
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:09,090
David from editing and in a book called
don't think of an elephant,

2827
01:57:09,091 --> 01:57:10,380
I think it was called.
What year was this?

2828
01:57:10,381 --> 01:57:11,760
When did I read that?
A long time ago.

2829
01:57:11,761 --> 01:57:14,220
But he basically talks about how
language,

2830
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:17,670
if you learn,
if you learn how to manipulate language,

2831
01:57:17,970 --> 01:57:19,850
it is very beneficial,
man.

2832
01:57:19,890 --> 01:57:21,030
You,
you will.

2833
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:23,300
It's really interesting.
I read a um,

2834
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:26,160
it's fun,
interesting things about like our

2835
01:57:26,161 --> 01:57:26,670
population.

2836
01:57:26,670 --> 01:57:30,180
Do you know that 80,
I think it's 82% of Americans can't name

2837
01:57:30,181 --> 01:57:35,181
one living scientist yet.
If you ask 82% of Americans will say

2838
01:57:36,211 --> 01:57:41,211
that politicians should be talking to
scientists even though they don't,

2839
01:57:41,851 --> 01:57:45,300
they can't name one living scientists
like Neil degrasse Tyson or Stephen

2840
01:57:45,301 --> 01:57:49,290
hawkings or Lawrence Krauss.
At the same time,

2841
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:53,040
there is a deep,
not only mistrust but also respect for

2842
01:57:53,041 --> 01:57:53,874
science.
In other words,

2843
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:56,490
hey,
you politicians listen to the fucking

2844
01:57:56,491 --> 01:57:57,121
size.
If there's,

2845
01:57:57,121 --> 01:57:59,760
if there's a weapon out there that can,
if there's a technology that can reduce

2846
01:57:59,761 --> 01:58:01,950
this all the dust,
listen to those fucking guys.

2847
01:58:01,951 --> 01:58:05,040
At the same time,
I find it very interesting that science

2848
01:58:05,041 --> 01:58:08,760
is still being questioned.
Like there's real questions on the right

2849
01:58:08,761 --> 01:58:12,990
about the science behind climate change.
Did you see what happened recently and

2850
01:58:12,991 --> 01:58:15,870
it was in Texas,
the recent rash of earthquakes.

2851
01:58:15,871 --> 01:58:19,350
I tweeted about it today directly
connected to fracking.

2852
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:23,160
I'm sure 100% but it's also interesting
is that both sides of the left and

2853
01:58:23,161 --> 01:58:24,330
right.
Speaking of tribalism,

2854
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:27,600
the left doesn't want to hear anything
about the difference,

2855
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:30,060
the scientific difference between men
and women.

2856
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:33,660
That would be an issue,
especially when you start talking about

2857
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:36,540
trans women,
but the difference between male and

2858
01:58:36,541 --> 01:58:40,860
female brains because what happens if
your James Dannemora is that what you're

2859
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:42,100
is

2860
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:47,100
that women are a victim to their biology
and ultimately are not able to overcome

2861
01:58:49,091 --> 01:58:53,680
certain things that men have inherently.
James [inaudible] from the Google knows.

2862
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:57,430
Yes.
I just want to as the Google memo guy.

2863
01:58:57,450 --> 01:59:00,160
Yeah and I read that Google and I'm
about twice and what's interesting is a

2864
01:59:00,161 --> 01:59:03,310
lot of evolutionary psychologists and
biologists basically said,

2865
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:08,050
well what he was saying was just drawing
on on empirical evidence based on how,

2866
01:59:08,110 --> 01:59:11,170
for example,
a 48 year old,

2867
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:16,560
a 48 month old infant female and a 48
month old male we'll look at too.

2868
01:59:17,981 --> 01:59:21,580
If you give them a choice between
looking at something moving and a human

2869
01:59:21,581 --> 01:59:25,120
face,
typically the female to 48 hour old

2870
01:59:25,121 --> 01:59:27,100
female,
we'll look at the face,

2871
01:59:27,101 --> 01:59:30,070
the human face,
the boy will look at the moving object.

2872
01:59:30,071 --> 01:59:32,680
What about lesbians?
I definitely kid is running out of the

2873
01:59:32,681 --> 01:59:36,940
room like leather Tuscadero that's a
different story with a Mohawk on the

2874
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:40,570
days that I don't [inaudible] haircut.
Do you remember when Pinky Tuscadero

2875
01:59:40,571 --> 01:59:42,160
came to town?
There was out of town.

2876
01:59:42,170 --> 01:59:43,003
Remember this?

2877
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:46,540
Yeah,
they did that thing when you got to

2878
01:59:46,541 --> 01:59:47,910
learn it.
How do you remember me that I don't

2879
01:59:47,911 --> 01:59:50,050
remember that we're the same age.
We had to learn it in high school.

2880
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:52,380
Who tested their out?
They keep Tuscadero

2881
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:56,830
got to learn it and once you learn it,
you only learn how to do it.

2882
01:59:56,831 --> 02:00:00,280
One side of we 50 or what was that?
Who was that show now?

2883
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:01,450
No,
that's a new chick.

2884
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:03,640
Oh,
that's her.

2885
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:04,830
That's what she looks like now.
That's good.

2886
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:06,640
Wow.
That's what she looked like.

2887
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:10,570
Leather Tuscadero hm.
That's leather.

2888
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:13,120
Tuscadero and then there was pinky.
Pinky.

2889
02:00:13,810 --> 02:00:16,960
Pinky was like a little tougher.
She wore like a pink leather jacket.

2890
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:19,770
She sure it did.
She is there.

2891
02:00:19,850 --> 02:00:22,060
She said she had her shirt like this
high.

2892
02:00:22,070 --> 02:00:24,510
That she was hot and like a dirty mom
away.

2893
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:26,500
Damn right.
She was fucking dancer.

2894
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:27,400
Ooh.

2895
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:30,880
We could hurt with Fonzie.
You want to talk about nicest guy in the

2896
02:00:30,881 --> 02:00:32,380
planet.
It might be Henry Winkler.

2897
02:00:32,381 --> 02:00:33,930
I've met him.
He's such a sweetie.

2898
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:36,280
He's a sweetie.
He's a beautiful man.

2899
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:37,760
He's a really,
really nice guy.

2900
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:40,210
I did it Kevin James movie with him.
You did?

2901
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:42,280
Yeah.
I could not have been nicer.

2902
02:00:42,490 --> 02:00:43,460
You know,
I was supposed to do.

2903
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:45,420
Kevin can wait.
They offered me apart,

2904
02:00:45,550 --> 02:00:47,380
but I was in New York and I couldn't do
it cause I was,

2905
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:49,540
I was doing a one off your fucking
excuses.

2906
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:51,770
Well,
I'm glad to that cause I feel bad.

2907
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:53,300
I Miss Kevin.
I would really love him.

2908
02:00:53,310 --> 02:00:54,910
And he's a great guy.
You talked to him lately.

2909
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:55,601
No,
I haven't,

2910
02:00:55,601 --> 02:00:58,060
but I love that car.
I love and Leah revenues on that show,

2911
02:00:58,061 --> 02:00:58,451
right?
Yeah,

2912
02:00:58,451 --> 02:00:59,590
she's back.
She's a new wife.

2913
02:00:59,591 --> 02:01:01,000
They damn,
I don't know what happened.

2914
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:04,450
Scientology,
when you mentioned Phil Hartman did some

2915
02:01:04,451 --> 02:01:04,990
album covers.

2916
02:01:04,990 --> 02:01:05,823
I found this.
Oh,

2917
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:07,570
Asia Dude.
Have you heard?

2918
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:12,540
Have you heard Charles Manson Song?
He did Asia Fuck Outta him.

2919
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:13,930
Steely Dan.
What?

2920
02:01:14,130 --> 02:01:14,800
Yeah,
whatever.

2921
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:17,310
What else do you have eight album cover
is designed by listening.

2922
02:01:17,330 --> 02:01:18,530
Can Be America.
Yeah,

2923
02:01:18,531 --> 02:01:19,740
that's right.
And POCO.

2924
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:22,900
Which fucking kitten now.
He was awesome,

2925
02:01:22,901 --> 02:01:26,080
man.
Did you hear that?

2926
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:29,590
Wow.
The firesign theater fighting clowns.

2927
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:31,870
Wow.
Damn.

2928
02:01:31,871 --> 02:01:34,060
I want to get a print of that.
Go back to that,

2929
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:37,090
see if we could find a print of that
fire sign theater.

2930
02:01:37,091 --> 02:01:37,640
Fine.
Yeah,

2931
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:38,950
I'll look it up,
but yeah,

2932
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:42,980
let's get a print of that and put it up
in the studio that did you hear Charles

2933
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:45,680
Manson's song to I hear about it.
Jerked off to it.

2934
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:47,670
It's amazing,
sir.

2935
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:48,680
Sarah,
please.

2936
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:52,190
Sorry,
five to ten five foot two Charlie.

2937
02:01:52,191 --> 02:01:53,210
Matthew.
Hi.

2938
02:01:53,250 --> 02:01:56,120
You're your garbage man.
He legally,

2939
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:03,430
I played him on Mad TV and me and that's
why baby without the,

2940
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:03,840
what do we do?

2941
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:06,500
You believe?
What do you do is amazing that that guy

2942
02:02:06,501 --> 02:02:10,490
got so many people to follow him,
but that's a thing like 900 year old

2943
02:02:10,491 --> 02:02:12,080
people would not fall.
Charles Manson,

2944
02:02:12,081 --> 02:02:13,460
man,
I'm talking about the 900 year old

2945
02:02:13,461 --> 02:02:14,360
people.
That's a long way,

2946
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:18,800
but that's the whole reason why we are
infants were just infants with a very

2947
02:02:18,801 --> 02:02:22,040
short lifetime as quick.
Let me ask you this.

2948
02:02:22,130 --> 02:02:25,010
Imagine if people look like you ever
look at a person from like the 18

2949
02:02:25,011 --> 02:02:26,930
hundreds when they first started
inventing photographs.

2950
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,820
You see a 25 year old like,
oh my God,

2951
02:02:28,821 --> 02:02:31,370
he's almost dead.
They look so old.

2952
02:02:31,910 --> 02:02:35,150
They look so weathered.
They looked like they were just dirt,

2953
02:02:35,151 --> 02:02:37,430
had been he Gary Fisher when they would
take pictures of with their dead

2954
02:02:37,431 --> 02:02:38,690
relatives.
Oh,

2955
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:40,500
you ever seen that?
This is my kid.

2956
02:02:40,501 --> 02:02:41,920
They all died.
I have pictures.

2957
02:02:41,921 --> 02:02:42,890
I'll take pictures with them.

2958
02:02:43,010 --> 02:02:45,170
Oh yeah,
those people,

2959
02:02:45,230 --> 02:02:47,280
they died quicker.
They looked like shit.

2960
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:49,310
What if you lived 800 years?
This is what I think about.

2961
02:02:49,670 --> 02:02:51,530
I don't think about developing that much
understanding.

2962
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:52,760
I feel like I'd be like,
all right,

2963
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:56,780
well I guess I'll start the drums and
then the guitar and then the piano and

2964
02:02:56,781 --> 02:03:00,080
I'll master those as well.
And I would just figure out all the skin

2965
02:03:00,110 --> 02:03:03,590
skills I've master.
Let me tell you what you would be at 80

2966
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:08,210
or 800 years old.
You'd be living in a castle and you

2967
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:12,680
would basically be having young ladies
come to the council and give them

2968
02:03:12,681 --> 02:03:14,220
seminars.
Yeah,

2969
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:16,860
yeah,
yeah.

2970
02:03:17,090 --> 02:03:17,840
I enjoy.
Well,

2971
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,770
older woman because your 800 they're
going to look hot as fuck and they're

2972
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:23,510
still going to be like kind of spiritual
but not really religious.

2973
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:27,690
Yup,
I do that too.

2974
02:03:29,470 --> 02:03:30,800
Why?
I don't know why.

2975
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:32,930
It's just top being awesome.
The sex DAPI and awesome.

2976
02:03:32,931 --> 02:03:36,180
I think that's a crock of shit designed
by people don't want to fuck me too.

2977
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:39,890
Me Too.
Me Too.

2978
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:45,040
When do you know can to look to
look Dixon molds wound.

2979
02:03:47,330 --> 02:03:49,400
It's going to be boring.
Well,

2980
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:50,660
okay,
maybe,

2981
02:03:50,661 --> 02:03:54,170
but I don't see any evidence.
I'm not seeing any evidence that that's

2982
02:03:54,171 --> 02:03:56,270
real.
I think you're making things up and I'm

2983
02:03:56,271 --> 02:03:57,830
not really interested in talking to you
about this,

2984
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:00,080
so I find your,
your,

2985
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:03,910
your fucking opinions are exhausting and
they boring,

2986
02:04:04,970 --> 02:04:08,510
so you hang onto them.
Your opinions are exhausting and they're

2987
02:04:08,511 --> 02:04:09,110
boring.
Yeah.

2988
02:04:09,110 --> 02:04:10,820
So you hang onto them,
you run with them,

2989
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:12,140
but I go,
Nah,

2990
02:04:12,650 --> 02:04:13,483
Nah,
I'm good.

2991
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:15,800
The base living,
here's the thing.

2992
02:04:15,801 --> 02:04:19,640
It's like there's this idea that there's
like some higher level of thinking and

2993
02:04:19,641 --> 02:04:22,940
then there's like base physical
pleasures that's not real.

2994
02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:25,070
You have a hundred years and then you're
dead.

2995
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:27,170
So you're supposed to have,
if you're lucky,

2996
02:04:27,171 --> 02:04:30,620
you've got a hundred beers.
Just because you enjoy some very

2997
02:04:30,621 --> 02:04:33,350
intellectual pursuits.
It does not mean you should enjoy

2998
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:37,130
getting your drink on every now and then
or doing something stupid,

2999
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:38,070
being silly or

3000
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:41,730
sacks or anything.
What would you say herself a friend,

3001
02:04:41,731 --> 02:04:43,290
what would you say to yourself right
now?

3002
02:04:43,291 --> 02:04:47,100
If I put your 25 year old or your 20
year old body right there,

3003
02:04:47,101 --> 02:04:48,480
what would you say to yourself right
now?

3004
02:04:49,170 --> 02:04:50,550
Figured out pitch.
Really?

3005
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:51,510
That's what I'd say.
Yeah.

3006
02:04:51,511 --> 02:04:52,980
You got to figure it out.
You gotta make your mistakes.

3007
02:04:53,010 --> 02:04:55,170
You're you,
what you're going to learn from someone.

3008
02:04:55,171 --> 02:04:57,180
You're never going to learn from them
sitting down saying,

3009
02:04:57,181 --> 02:04:58,290
listen,
you got to learn from me.

3010
02:04:58,770 --> 02:05:00,180
Well,
you're going to learn from someone as by

3011
02:05:00,181 --> 02:05:02,250
example.
We're going to learn for someone as by

3012
02:05:02,251 --> 02:05:06,660
someone out there like following a lead
that you know is difficult and achieving

3013
02:05:06,661 --> 02:05:10,290
teams that you think are very hard to
achieve and you watch that and you go,

3014
02:05:10,291 --> 02:05:11,670
okay,
well you got to do is you got to get

3015
02:05:11,671 --> 02:05:12,960
comfortable with being uncomfortable.

3016
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:14,880
You got to grit your teeth.
You've got to bear down.

3017
02:05:14,881 --> 02:05:16,230
You got to work hard.
You gotta be honest.

3018
02:05:16,231 --> 02:05:18,780
You can't go to be honest with yourself
about how hard you're working.

3019
02:05:18,781 --> 02:05:20,340
And that's what a lot of people are not
doing.

3020
02:05:20,610 --> 02:05:22,770
That's what you learned.
You never know how to,

3021
02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:27,030
how to slip a jab until you get punched
in the face of much going to show you

3022
02:05:27,031 --> 02:05:29,070
how to do it.
But to really learn it to the point

3023
02:05:29,071 --> 02:05:31,440
where it's a part of your normal
patterns,

3024
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:33,890
there's certain things that happen to
people where you,

3025
02:05:33,891 --> 02:05:36,570
you see them like slide their hips back
there.

3026
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:37,860
Oh,
that's the guy who's been kicked in the

3027
02:05:37,861 --> 02:05:38,694
stomach.
Yes.

3028
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:42,750
Like he,
he's been times where everything you do

3029
02:05:42,751 --> 02:05:44,100
as a reaction,
you don't have to think about it,

3030
02:05:44,101 --> 02:05:45,670
but it gets you same thing for sure.
Yeah,

3031
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:47,970
yeah.
Those pathways get carved in and by the

3032
02:05:47,971 --> 02:05:49,770
way,
those pathways can be really shitty too.

3033
02:05:50,010 --> 02:05:52,690
You're going to have a bunch of shitty
pathways carved into your head that

3034
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:54,840
ensure your failure.
It didn't sure your failure,

3035
02:05:54,940 --> 02:05:57,750
they didn't show you're,
you're questioning yourself and also

3036
02:05:57,751 --> 02:06:00,660
blaming a bunch of other people.
You got to like,

3037
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:02,430
you know how like people are supposed to
edit.

3038
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:04,470
You're supposed to edit.
Like when you make a document he's

3039
02:06:04,471 --> 02:06:05,670
supposed to edit.
When you write a book,

3040
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:09,750
you should also add thoughts.
You can't just let them all run wild.

3041
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:12,030
Right?
You can't because some of them are

3042
02:06:12,090 --> 02:06:15,960
really like impulsive and they're,
they're not well fabricated.

3043
02:06:15,961 --> 02:06:17,610
Right.
And if you try to defend those fucking

3044
02:06:17,611 --> 02:06:19,950
stupid thoughts,
you're going to be like what we were

3045
02:06:19,951 --> 02:06:23,070
talking about with conspiracies and you
learn what not to listen to.

3046
02:06:23,620 --> 02:06:24,840
That's the other thing.
Not all,

3047
02:06:24,841 --> 02:06:27,240
not all fucking ideas are on the same
plane.

3048
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:31,350
There are a lot of people you shouldn't
be listening to and if you want to be

3049
02:06:31,351 --> 02:06:33,840
really good at something,
find the right tutor.

3050
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:36,810
There's big differences in how file
Codero and you know,

3051
02:06:36,811 --> 02:06:38,550
if you want to learn how to kickbox or
whatever,

3052
02:06:38,551 --> 02:06:40,470
and that dude over there,
right?

3053
02:06:40,471 --> 02:06:40,921
Yeah.
Right,

3054
02:06:40,921 --> 02:06:41,521
right.
Yeah.

3055
02:06:41,521 --> 02:06:42,670
If you can,
well,

3056
02:06:42,690 --> 02:06:43,501
yeah,
if you have the,

3057
02:06:43,501 --> 02:06:44,790
I mean,
they'd be be a good,

3058
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,580
good guidance and tutelage is really
important.

3059
02:06:47,610 --> 02:06:48,620
It is.
You know,

3060
02:06:48,621 --> 02:06:51,390
it's interesting now is that people that
don't have access to good guns and

3061
02:06:51,391 --> 02:06:53,310
tutor,
which still have access to online,

3062
02:06:53,570 --> 02:06:55,170
say Thomas because you got,
you got,

3063
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:57,230
you got the Gracie University,
you've got,

3064
02:06:57,231 --> 02:06:58,690
and you've got youtube,
you've got Hansel,

3065
02:06:58,700 --> 02:06:59,910
gracie giving you a little thing.
I mean,

3066
02:06:59,911 --> 02:07:01,380
could he,
Bravo has this whole system,

3067

10th planet Jiu Jitsu System.
It's all available online.

3068
02:07:03,541 --> 02:07:05,700
You can learn all the moves and if
you're in a small town,

3069

Eddie has over a want to say go to 10th
planet,

I want to say he has more than 80

3071
02:07:14,071 --> 02:07:15,570
students,
or excuse me,

02:07:15,571 --> 02:07:17,970
more than 80 studios worldwide.

3073
02:07:18,270 --> 02:07:20,820
Yeah,
I think he has more than 80 schools,

3074
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:22,103
so,
wow.

3075
02:07:22,230 --> 02:07:27,090
And they put up a lot of the data of
like the stuff they're doing and stuff.

3076
02:07:27,091 --> 02:07:29,040
They're working on drills and things.
A lot of it's online.

3077
02:07:29,490 --> 02:07:30,610
Yeah.
That's amazing.

3078
02:07:30,620 --> 02:07:30,991
Yeah.
How many,

3079
02:07:30,991 --> 02:07:33,030
what does it say?
Look at the fucking,

3080
02:07:33,390 --> 02:07:37,830

10th Planet that the city says he's

3081
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:40,330
charging a lot of license,
that he's making money.

3082
02:07:40,331 --> 02:07:41,530
Trust me.
We'll talk later.

3083
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:43,480
Look at this though.
Look at this.

3084
02:07:43,510 --> 02:07:44,590
This is,
I mean,

3085
02:07:44,591 --> 02:07:46,120
this is insane.
That's amazing.

3086
02:07:46,150 --> 02:07:48,090
He's,
he's got a huge accomplishments.

3087
02:07:48,091 --> 02:07:50,770
Z,
a crazy number of people that follow his

3088
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:52,340
Jujitsu.
He is right about his conspiracy

3089
02:07:52,350 --> 02:07:54,640
theories,
but he's definitely right about Jujitsu.

3090
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:56,890
You know the chemistry of things.
Another one,

3091
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:58,990
like he,
he claimed that for a long time.

3092
02:07:58,991 --> 02:08:00,880
He still,
he'll put something up on his instagram

3093
02:08:00,881 --> 02:08:02,650
page.
I know why he believes that because he

3094
02:08:02,651 --> 02:08:07,120
doesn't believe in the government,
but my position is I get that and I

3095
02:08:07,121 --> 02:08:09,520
don't,
I don't trust a lot of people either,

3096
02:08:09,730 --> 02:08:13,330
but you have to trust the people that
are scientists that are all agreeing

3097
02:08:13,331 --> 02:08:17,140
that if a fucking jet engine that's
heated up goes through condensation and

3098
02:08:17,141 --> 02:08:20,560
a certain atmosphere that creates
artificial cloud being responsive to

3099
02:08:20,561 --> 02:08:21,394
evidence.

3100
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:23,260
It is.
And it's also like you,

3101
02:08:23,261 --> 02:08:24,520
you,
you can't,

3102
02:08:25,090 --> 02:08:28,480
you can't mock that.
Like it's very important if you're going

3103
02:08:28,481 --> 02:08:31,060
to get anywhere with any of their stance
on your wrist and in your hand,

3104
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:33,130
and you're going to have,
when you're listening to it like this,

3105
02:08:33,131 --> 02:08:35,800
this is their science,
that measurable science that works,

3106
02:08:35,801 --> 02:08:37,420
right?
So the science that goes into your

3107
02:08:37,660 --> 02:08:41,030
earphones that goes into the vaccines
and antibiotics,

3108
02:08:41,031 --> 02:08:44,440
I push you beyond your black biology,
the science that gets food,

3109
02:08:44,441 --> 02:08:46,930
fresh food in front of you.
All that shit is,

3110
02:08:46,990 --> 02:08:51,430
is you're benefiting from that.
And usually the science that you don't

3111
02:08:51,431 --> 02:08:55,990
believe in is the same science you're
actually using to speak into.

3112
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:57,250
Well that's,
yeah,

3113
02:08:57,310 --> 02:08:59,710
that's the argument we were having
yesterday that it's,

3114
02:08:59,711 --> 02:09:04,360
it's so ridiculous that anybody would
have an issue with the highest minds in

3115
02:09:04,361 --> 02:09:08,230
the world deciding whether or not things
are real and things are not real and

3116
02:09:08,231 --> 02:09:09,280
what is and what isn't.

3117
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:11,890
Well,
he thinks that's really weird.

3118
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:14,830
I don't know what he believes we could
sit him down and talk to them about it,

3119
02:09:14,831 --> 02:09:19,831
but my point about all of it was that
the very genius that allows him to like

3120
02:09:20,801 --> 02:09:24,040
shut down Jujitsu attacks,
like he doesn't recognize Jujitsu

3121
02:09:24,041 --> 02:09:24,731
attacks.
It's like,

3122
02:09:24,731 --> 02:09:26,350
well this is valid too.
No,

3123
02:09:26,351 --> 02:09:28,960
he's like,
shut that shit down and move forward.

3124
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:31,030
It's one of the reasons why he's so good
at Jujitsu.

3125
02:09:31,450 --> 02:09:35,800
He's so good at Jujitsu cause he doesn't
like recognize your attack is valid.

3126
02:09:35,860 --> 02:09:37,810
Gosh,
shut shit down and it moves.

3127
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:41,170
It's really interesting as well because
he's an undeniable,

3128
02:09:41,171 --> 02:09:43,600
Eddie Bravo is an undeniable jujitsu
genius.

3129
02:09:43,690 --> 02:09:45,070
I haven't sound to die.
I know.

3130
02:09:45,071 --> 02:09:46,570
I've been salivary.
Sure.

3131
02:09:46,660 --> 02:09:47,970
Yeah,
he's great salivary.

3132
02:09:48,610 --> 02:09:50,520
I'm sorry,
have some reason to shout out to Ivan.

3133
02:09:50,600 --> 02:09:53,560
He,
I went and he gave me a lesson and if so

3134
02:09:53,561 --> 02:09:54,030
awesome.

3135
02:09:54,030 --> 02:09:56,260
It was fun.
I went to Seattle and the school,

3136
02:09:56,380 --> 02:09:58,330
you know,
he's the only guy in the UFC that has a

3137
02:09:58,331 --> 02:10:00,370
submission.
I think maybe one of the person might

3138
02:10:00,371 --> 02:10:02,500
have it now,
but for the longest time he was the only

3139
02:10:02,501 --> 02:10:06,880
guy that had a body triangle rear mount
submission where he got a guide.

3140
02:10:06,910 --> 02:10:09,640
He got Tony Fryklund in the,
he got his back.

3141
02:10:09,870 --> 02:10:13,060
And when you flatten somebody out and
you have someone in a body triangle,

3142
02:10:13,090 --> 02:10:16,390
yeah,
it's so fucking brutally painful.

3143
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:17,520
Yeah.
That um,

3144
02:10:17,770 --> 02:10:20,830
Tony frequent tapped.
He was the first guy ever to tap from a

3145
02:10:20,831 --> 02:10:23,500
body triangle.
And I remember I've watched him do that

3146
02:10:23,501 --> 02:10:25,360
and I was like,
oh wow.

3147
02:10:25,361 --> 02:10:28,240
Cause I knew that that hurt,
but I didn't know if someone would tap

3148
02:10:28,241 --> 02:10:30,180
from it in a UFC fight as well.
Whoa.

3149
02:10:30,190 --> 02:10:32,920
For a guy like me,
he's probably 43 44 now.

3150
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:37,180
And he said he invited me to school.
I was just so excited and he's going to

3151
02:10:37,181 --> 02:10:39,200
teach me tricks and just like in close
fighting,

3152
02:10:39,201 --> 02:10:40,160
Bach,
dirty boxing.

3153
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:41,211
And He,
we put,

3154
02:10:41,211 --> 02:10:43,040
he put vaseline on me.
I was like,

3155
02:10:43,041 --> 02:10:44,060
what's going on here?
Yeah.

3156
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:48,670
See he gets a body triangle last cross.
It's tap and fucking the pocock.

3157
02:10:48,770 --> 02:10:50,840
He's awesome.
It's so painful.

3158
02:10:50,841 --> 02:10:52,340
He's such a great guy.
Look at him.

3159
02:10:52,680 --> 02:10:53,860
He's from Chile.
Yeah,

3160
02:10:53,900 --> 02:10:56,000
he's a bad motherfucker.
And he's got a rooster tattooed on his

3161
02:10:56,001 --> 02:10:56,700
wrist.
He does it.

3162
02:10:56,700 --> 02:10:59,370
And it was funny because he came to my
show and then I,

3163
02:10:59,430 --> 02:11:00,860
the next day I,
I was,

3164
02:11:00,990 --> 02:11:04,190
I got an a ring with him and he had,
he put greets salmon and we're just

3165
02:11:04,191 --> 02:11:06,530
doing little things with gloves.
And when you,

3166
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:10,760
it's for a man like me,
for a man like me who's basically 170

3167
02:11:10,761 --> 02:11:12,810
pounds and nothing come back.

3168
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:17,750
And when you feel that a man who's been
thrown bodies around his whole life and

3169
02:11:17,751 --> 02:11:19,670
punching,
and it's been his life and he's,

3170
02:11:19,730 --> 02:11:21,710
oh,
he's probably about to 20 maybe to 30

3171
02:11:22,070 --> 02:11:24,230
and he acts a little heavier than when
he used to fight.

3172
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:28,820
But the strength and the,
just the density of his body as you're

3173
02:11:28,821 --> 02:11:31,550
fucking trying to do anything and he
just moves you.

3174
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:34,220
He kind of shocks you around with a
script writer.

3175
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:37,700
It's so humbling and he's super
technical to Oh fuck.

3176
02:11:37,710 --> 02:11:39,550
He so to Ivan was like super,
super.

3177
02:11:39,990 --> 02:11:41,870
That's it.
Did I take a picture of him and was

3178
02:11:41,871 --> 02:11:44,690
like,
it was a picture of him and Maury Smith

3179
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:47,480
being held court and meet with Charlie
Murphy.

3180
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:51,140
Charlie Murphy is explaining something
called the Chicago Ridge hand.

3181
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:54,500
That's like a,
a technique karate technique that people

3182
02:11:54,501 --> 02:11:56,900
aren't using enough in mma.
He's kind of right.

3183
02:11:57,140 --> 02:12:00,260
It's a rich hand is where you had hit
someone with a side of your hand.

3184
02:12:00,261 --> 02:12:02,990
Do you ever know rich hand?
They were practicing karate move.

3185
02:12:03,140 --> 02:12:04,760
You'll know about chet shot.
I don't know shit.

3186
02:12:04,790 --> 02:12:06,770
Karate move is a rich hand.
It's like this.

3187
02:12:06,771 --> 02:12:09,680
This is Eddie Murphy.
That's Ivan salivary to the right of the

3188
02:12:09,681 --> 02:12:12,230
table and the black bald headed dude is
Maury Smith.

3189
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:13,490
Come on.
Yup.

3190
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:17,240
You got two bad mother,
two killers at the table and then I'm,

3191
02:12:17,241 --> 02:12:19,730
I'm back behind this,
all this stuff.

3192
02:12:19,731 --> 02:12:21,530
I'm on this side of it,
but uh,

3193
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:26,630
it was a charlie murphy explaining,
I don't know shit about the Chicago look

3194
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:30,440
at his hand and so quotable Charlie was
holding court.

3195
02:12:30,590 --> 02:12:33,860
Charlie was so funny.
Like I don't think people that never got

3196
02:12:33,861 --> 02:12:36,260
to hang out with Charlie ever.
Really good to understand how funny

3197
02:12:36,261 --> 02:12:38,720
Charlie was.
I heard is a great storyteller is

3198
02:12:38,721 --> 02:12:42,020
amazing storyteller,
but he just would hold court and you

3199
02:12:42,021 --> 02:12:43,940
would let them,
you would fall to the ground laughing.

3200
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:48,170
He was just a great,
he was great at like being the guy who

3201
02:12:48,171 --> 02:12:53,171
told the story the best and it had the,
but it didn't translate in a stand up as

3202
02:12:53,961 --> 02:12:56,360
much as it should have been.
This is what I think happened.

3203
02:12:56,660 --> 02:12:59,420
I think he jumped into standup like way
too quick.

3204
02:12:59,421 --> 02:13:03,530
It was headlining like really early.
Like he didn't do like the whole thing

3205
02:13:03,531 --> 02:13:07,640
like we all did like do the open mic
night and then start doing no dude,

3206
02:13:07,641 --> 02:13:11,750
he was headlining like that.
He was charlie my from the Chappelle

3207
02:13:11,751 --> 02:13:16,240
show him done standard before that he
had never done standup,

3208
02:13:16,250 --> 02:13:18,970
can't do it.
So he figured out how to weight it.

3209
02:13:18,980 --> 02:13:20,540
I mean,
he did it and he figured out,

3210
02:13:20,541 --> 02:13:23,870
but I don't think he ever,
I think if you had allowed Charlie

3211
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:25,630
Murphy develop the way we all did.
Yes.

3212
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:29,180
From Open Miker to Middle Act,
a headliner to holt,

3213
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:32,850
he would have been a world class
assassin.

3214
02:13:33,270 --> 02:13:35,820
And he know he died.
It's still a very funny comedian and he

3215
02:13:35,821 --> 02:13:38,490
was headlining all over the world.
Did you know he was sick when you were

3216
02:13:38,491 --> 02:13:39,420
hanging up?
No,

3217
02:13:39,421 --> 02:13:42,880
he was in sick when I was hanging out
with leukemia or some kind of a stretch.

3218
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:45,540
But that all happened after,
um,

3219
02:13:46,290 --> 02:13:48,450
after I'd seen him,
I hadn't seen him in a while.

3220
02:13:48,451 --> 02:13:52,770
He did my podcast in like 2000,
I want to say in 12,

3221
02:13:52,771 --> 02:13:54,690
somewhere around there,
maybe 13.

3222
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:57,780
Um,
him and my friend freeze love.

3223
02:13:58,170 --> 02:14:00,110
Did you ever meet Eddie Murphy?
Yeah.

3224
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:02,060
Met Eddie and uh,
Hawaii once,

3225
02:14:02,070 --> 02:14:03,450
just randomly.
It was funny.

3226
02:14:03,870 --> 02:14:05,360
It was the craziest thing ever.
Really.

3227
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:07,920
It's like he knows who I am with.
This is so cool,

3228
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:08,731
dude.
He goes,

3229
02:14:08,731 --> 02:14:12,400
you're a funny motherfucker.
What the fuck happened?

3230
02:14:13,410 --> 02:14:15,630
He reached down and grabbed my hand.
He gripped it.

3231
02:14:16,170 --> 02:14:19,410
Bobby funny mother Fabi had,
who's married to Whitney Houston.

3232
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:23,100
Bobby Brown came up to me the other day
and the comedy store and told me some

3233
02:14:23,101 --> 02:14:25,140
crazy.
Bobby Brown came up to me.

3234
02:14:25,370 --> 02:14:27,330
I was,
I was getting my ticket and I was

3235
02:14:27,390 --> 02:14:28,740
flying.
I was flying from,

3236
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:30,900
I can't remember where.
And he came up and he goes,

3237
02:14:30,901 --> 02:14:32,130
you're funny dude,
man,

3238
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:33,900
you make me laugh a lot and you're
shaking my head.

3239
02:14:33,910 --> 02:14:36,330
I didn't realize who it was until
somebody came up and said,

3240
02:14:36,331 --> 02:14:37,111
you know,
that was right.

3241
02:14:37,111 --> 02:14:38,820
I go,
I don't,

3242
02:14:38,821 --> 02:14:39,960
and he goes,
that was Bobby Brown.

3243
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:40,741
I go,
fuck that.

3244
02:14:40,741 --> 02:14:44,790
He looked familiar and then we sat.
I sat next to him singing the songs to

3245
02:14:44,791 --> 02:14:48,860
him and everyone else to have bad tech
camp.

3246
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:55,340
Did you know he was the first dude to
Dirac the microphone on the side of his

3247
02:14:55,411 --> 02:14:59,550
face.
Really headset son who had a headset for

3248
02:14:59,551 --> 02:15:00,720
Bob.
You're fucking Brian.

3249
02:15:00,750 --> 02:15:01,770
And he was dancing.

3250
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:03,780
Who the fuck had a headset before Bobby
Brown.

3251
02:15:04,230 --> 02:15:06,300
He was like pushing the technology.
Yep.

3252
02:15:06,510 --> 02:15:08,430
Right.
And then Christopher Titus started doing

3253
02:15:08,431 --> 02:15:10,020
it on stage,
but healy and I said,

3254
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:12,180
hell no,
no.

3255
02:15:12,740 --> 02:15:15,030
Titus does it still.
I think he has like a little microphone.

3256
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:17,340
Hmm?
Does the whole thing walks and talks

3257
02:15:17,341 --> 02:15:19,560
like this?
Have you?

3258
02:15:19,590 --> 02:15:21,330
You've done like letterman.
There he is.

3259
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:24,690
Look at him Brown.
A couple of full on headsets on.

3260
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:26,670
I mean if you sit,
realize how rich he was because he's

3261
02:15:26,671 --> 02:15:27,900
still super rich.
Must be,

3262
02:15:27,990 --> 02:15:30,930
oh what am I as accountant?
Look at that picture of him with the

3263
02:15:30,931 --> 02:15:31,764
headset on.
They'll go,

3264
02:15:33,150 --> 02:15:34,770
dude,
this is like a guy.

3265
02:15:34,771 --> 02:15:38,540
If you were trying to get your Imac
fixed and you had to call India to

3266
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:41,940
please look at please let ain't got it.
I'm mad right there.

3267
02:15:42,350 --> 02:15:44,120
You kidding me with that tank top you
tank,

3268
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:47,880
you tuck that tank top on and you guess
that you get the jacket off your

3269
02:15:47,881 --> 02:15:48,840
shoulders a little big.

3270
02:15:49,530 --> 02:15:51,600
By the way,
that's what it's a gay porn.

3271
02:15:51,601 --> 02:15:53,970
If I ever seen in worries and look at
those offering wristbands,

3272
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:55,500
why else did you have wrist wristbands
on it?

3273
02:15:55,501 --> 02:15:59,070
Unless you were there to stop hands.
Don't get all sweaty when you know when

3274
02:15:59,071 --> 02:16:01,530
you have lube all over your hands,
it doesn't get into your elbows.

3275
02:16:01,660 --> 02:16:03,600
Damn right.
Damn right.

3276
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:06,570
Damn right.
Can't have blue double hell,

3277
02:16:06,571 --> 02:16:07,680
but I'm so proud.
Don't be mad.

3278
02:16:07,681 --> 02:16:09,120
We're just joking around.
I'm a big fan.

3279
02:16:09,980 --> 02:16:11,760
I'm a big fan.
My prerogative bitch.

3280
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:13,050
He's awesome.
Right?

3281
02:16:13,110 --> 02:16:15,480
That was a great fucking song.
He had some amazing shit.

3282
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:18,090
It's about motherfucker,
but that does look,

3283
02:16:18,091 --> 02:16:18,920
yeah,
the way I like,

3284
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:21,570
but not like when anybody,
anybody recognizes me.

3285
02:16:21,571 --> 02:16:23,580
I love it.
So not to do anything wrong with it.

3286
02:16:23,581 --> 02:16:25,110
I'm not a cool celebrity.
I'm not a,

3287

3288
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:28,620
You're hurting my feelings.

3289
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:29,980
You're cool celebrity.
Thanks buddy.

3290
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:32,230
If I wasn't friends with you,
I'd be psyched to be friends with you.

3291
02:16:32,350 --> 02:16:35,650
I care attitude.
I'm looking for a young man like he's

3292
02:16:35,651 --> 02:16:37,080

02:17:54,730 --> 02:17:55,750
know.
Quite a few.

3328
02:17:56,010 --> 02:17:57,980
It's like a good lineup.
That's a,

3329
02:17:57,981 --> 02:17:59,990
it's the same Tripoli show comedy
castle.

3330
02:18:00,020 --> 02:18:01,180
Excellent.
Yeah,

3331
02:18:01,181 --> 02:18:02,560
he's got a,
he's got a very good line up.

3332
02:18:02,570 --> 02:18:04,750
I think one or two other comedians on
that show.

3333
02:18:05,230 --> 02:18:07,300
Russell Peters in the house.
My main man.

3334
02:18:07,330 --> 02:18:09,710
Someone else.
Oh Shit.

3335
02:18:09,720 --> 02:18:11,340
Please face coming.
He's amazing.

3336
02:18:11,350 --> 02:18:13,880
He's hilarious.
Those are the other two are those really

3337
02:18:14,410 --> 02:18:16,420
good lineup right there.
Great God damn lineup.

3338
02:18:16,470 --> 02:18:20,020
I think the stitches for your sides.
You Eleanor,

3339
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:21,860
Eleanor Kerrigan.
Ah,

3340
02:18:21,970 --> 02:18:24,880
very funny.
I love Alan Moore is one of the funniest

3341
02:18:24,881 --> 02:18:28,900
people alive and used to be a waitress.
She was a waitress at the comedy store

3342
02:18:28,901 --> 02:18:32,860
for years and she was the girl that I
would go to when they would tell me

3343
02:18:32,861 --> 02:18:34,180
someone to tell me that this guy is
really funny.

3344
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:34,781
I'd go,
eleanor,

3345
02:18:34,781 --> 02:18:35,890
is that guy really funny?
She'd go,

3346
02:18:36,530 --> 02:18:40,000
fucking hack.
Eleanor is a wonderful human being and

3347
02:18:40,001 --> 02:18:43,720
reminds me of the women in my family,
so I have a very soft spot for her

3348
02:18:43,810 --> 02:18:46,160
because she's Italian,
I think is a softball.

3349
02:18:46,390 --> 02:18:47,740
I don't know if she has time,
but by the way,

3350
02:18:47,741 --> 02:18:48,880
I love her.
Oh,

3351
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:50,100
that's beautiful.
I love her too.

3352
02:18:50,230 --> 02:18:52,360
She's Irish names Kerrigan.
It's true.

3353
02:18:52,361 --> 02:18:55,720
Actually she's married.
Isn't it her married name though?

3354
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:56,890
No,
I feel like she's telling it.

3355
02:18:56,950 --> 02:18:57,700
Okay.
Nope,

3356
02:18:57,700 --> 02:18:59,910
that's it.
Eleanor Kerrigan starting.

3357
02:18:59,930 --> 02:19:03,010
She's from the,
she's from the Italian side of our,

3358
02:19:03,060 --> 02:19:05,440
what?
This is not real.

3359
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:07,750
You don't know how real the eleanor is
an Italian man.

3360
02:19:07,751 --> 02:19:10,300
Nobody appreciates Dama rare.
More than the Irish

3361
02:19:11,820 --> 02:19:13,810
dominant.
I said one time we were talking to this

3362
02:19:13,820 --> 02:19:15,100
man depth,
we're talking to this young,

3363
02:19:15,130 --> 02:19:19,750
very pretty girls at the upstairs in the
laugh factory and he's taking a piss

3364
02:19:19,751 --> 02:19:20,680
next to dove.
And he goes,

3365
02:19:21,150 --> 02:19:21,581
oh,
those,

3366
02:19:21,581 --> 02:19:22,840
uh,
those girls good looking.

3367
02:19:23,140 --> 02:19:24,790
And Doug goes,
yeah,

3368
02:19:24,791 --> 02:19:25,780
you couldn't tell.
And he goes,

3369
02:19:26,050 --> 02:19:27,070
I have no,
I mean,

3370
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:28,100
at that age,
you know,

3371
02:19:28,101 --> 02:19:29,660
when they're that young,
they gotta have a goat head.

3372
02:19:29,690 --> 02:19:34,690
I'm still attracted to
dom.

3373
02:19:35,121 --> 02:19:38,600
Irrera is a god that's still swinging.
Like,

3374
02:19:38,601 --> 02:19:40,280
you know,
like we all have this idea that a

3375
02:19:40,281 --> 02:19:42,890
certain comedian age,
like when you get into your sixties

3376
02:19:42,891 --> 02:19:44,330
you're not going to write new material
anymore.

3377
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:47,210
He's always writing and killing.
He's always killing and he's killing it.

3378
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:49,430
He sits next to you.
He'll pull over and sit next to you and

3379
02:19:49,431 --> 02:19:49,761
go,
oh,

3380
02:19:49,761 --> 02:19:54,370
look at you queers like this.
Just find a way to automate things.

3381
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:55,700
But what it tells me,
it goes on and she goes,

3382
02:19:55,701 --> 02:19:57,920
I did a set really well whenever he
goes,

3383
02:19:58,180 --> 02:19:58,700
bro,
Bro,

3384
02:19:58,700 --> 02:19:59,840
come over.
I was like,

3385
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:00,621
oh,
this is what,

3386
02:20:00,621 --> 02:20:01,730
I didn't know him that well.
I go,

3387
02:20:02,030 --> 02:20:02,510
what?
What?

3388
02:20:02,510 --> 02:20:03,470
What's up done?
He goes,

3389
02:20:03,950 --> 02:20:05,540
you know what I like about you as a
comedian?

3390
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:09,200
I was like,
what so exciting is you don't really go

3391
02:20:09,201 --> 02:20:10,940
for the laughs.

3392
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:15,810
I was like,
fuck.

3393
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:18,500
That's where he lives.
He lives in the joking with other

3394
02:20:18,501 --> 02:20:19,720
comedians.
It's like dom,

3395
02:20:19,740 --> 02:20:20,930
my rare,
in my opinion,

3396
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:24,410
is the best guest ever on killed Tony.
It was seeing him until to now.

3397
02:20:24,411 --> 02:20:26,180
I'm sure he's great.
He's magical.

3398
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:28,160
He's magical.
Like I've done it with him.

3399
02:20:28,161 --> 02:20:30,380
He's magical cause he's still
professionally funny.

3400
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:31,670
He's so professional.
He funny.

3401
02:20:31,671 --> 02:20:35,270
But also there's a bunch of comedians
that he's making laugh.

3402
02:20:35,271 --> 02:20:37,190
Like that's what Dama rocks like best
at.

3403
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:38,211
So it's,
you know,

3404
02:20:38,211 --> 02:20:43,211
me and him and red band and a Tony and
then the comedian who does the sat and

3405
02:20:43,641 --> 02:20:46,730
then the audience who are comedy nerds.
So it's like dom irrera.

3406
02:20:46,731 --> 02:20:50,090
It's just coming in there fucking with
six guns loaded.

3407
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:51,950
Yup.
Yup.

3408
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:53,001
Yeah.
That's his,

3409
02:20:53,001 --> 02:20:53,960
his,
he's like,

3410
02:20:53,990 --> 02:20:55,550
I just got an arsenal.
Yeah.

3411
02:20:55,551 --> 02:20:56,990
If I,
if I was Tony Hinchcliffe,

3412
02:20:56,991 --> 02:20:58,040
I would fire everybody else.

3413
02:20:58,380 --> 02:21:02,570
And I would say the talk show is dom
irrera is there.

3414
02:21:02,571 --> 02:21:05,600
And then another guest,
like it's always dom irrera have him on

3415
02:21:05,601 --> 02:21:06,860
the fighter and the kid,
I don't,

3416
02:21:06,861 --> 02:21:07,910
we haven't had him.
Never on time.

3417
02:21:07,950 --> 02:21:09,710
No long time ago.
He couldn't make it.

3418
02:21:09,711 --> 02:21:11,150
I can't remember what it was.
I got to get them on.

3419
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:13,610
I fucking love them.
Who's your least favorite guest?

3420
02:21:13,970 --> 02:21:16,220
Awesome fighter.
And the kid on the fighter and the kid.

3421
02:21:16,221 --> 02:21:17,660
Yeah.
My least favorite guests.

3422
02:21:17,690 --> 02:21:19,500
Don't tell me,
let's just keep this shit.

3423
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,170
I don't even,
I can't remember.

3424
02:21:21,171 --> 02:21:23,480
If you ask someone a question,
you hope they don't answer this one.

3425
02:21:23,481 --> 02:21:26,750
Will some people just kind of like,
just don't come to play.

3426
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:28,880
Oh like they don't know what they're
doing.

3427
02:21:28,910 --> 02:21:30,950
They just don't come that they might
have be having an off day.

3428
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:32,660
If I don't pay right now,
I'm going to die.

3429
02:21:32,660 --> 02:21:35,060
How do you not have to pay?
God,

3430
02:21:35,061 --> 02:21:37,070
you're impressive.
Huge bladder.

3431
02:21:37,250 --> 02:21:39,770
Go ahead and do my huge deck and I'll be
right back.

3432
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:42,180
Jamie and I'll talk about Lebron James.
All right.

3433
02:21:42,181 --> 02:21:44,600
Don't
tell me.

3434
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:45,620
Tell me things.
Jamie,

3435
02:21:46,070 --> 02:21:48,800
is there a new sneaker?
He does have a new seeker out.

3436
02:21:49,030 --> 02:21:51,140
Well,
did they have one every season yet?

3437
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:54,230
He's got two different pairs.
He also has his own imprint label on

3438
02:21:54,231 --> 02:21:55,780
Nike,
which is a,

3439
02:21:55,820 --> 02:21:57,740
that's a ball or may he sponsors Ohio
state.

3440
02:21:57,890 --> 02:22:01,370
That's like conor mcgregor starts cope
promoting with the UFC like it takes it

3441
02:22:01,371 --> 02:22:02,600
to the next level.
Right.

3442
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:04,370
Did you hear anything about conner
yesterday?

3443
02:22:04,480 --> 02:22:05,960
Don't know if it's rumors or not.
Well,

3444
02:22:06,010 --> 02:22:10,310
he got into a fight and in a pub or
something and I know terrible random

3445
02:22:10,311 --> 02:22:11,870
shit about,
I don't know if it was even accurate.

3446
02:22:12,410 --> 02:22:14,180
That's the problem with keeping it real.
Yeah.

3447
02:22:14,830 --> 02:22:16,180
You know,
if you want to keep it real and hanging

3448
02:22:16,181 --> 02:22:18,710
with the people,
eventually someone's going to test you.

3449
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:21,110
Someone like you were when you were 20
you know,

3450
02:22:21,111 --> 02:22:21,790
maybe.
Sure.

3451
02:22:21,790 --> 02:22:25,830
I Dunno if conner was into that.
I assume he wasn't because he's a

3452
02:22:25,831 --> 02:22:26,370
winner,

3453
02:22:26,370 --> 02:22:29,070
but man,
that absolutely can happen if you want

3454
02:22:29,071 --> 02:22:31,470
to be out there.
Again,

3455
02:22:32,310 --> 02:22:34,590
Hashtag keep it real balling to,
yeah,

3456
02:22:34,591 --> 02:22:36,300
Hashtag balling.
I mean he's,

3457
02:22:36,330 --> 02:22:39,510
he's walking around with expensive
watches,

3458
02:22:39,690 --> 02:22:42,000
these beautiful David August suits on.
He wears,

3459
02:22:42,001 --> 02:22:45,390
he's tailored suits everywhere.
Here's the super expensive shoes and

3460
02:22:45,391 --> 02:22:49,230
watches and many of their lambos are
driving around Ireland to a lot.

3461
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:50,310
That's great point.
No,

3462
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:52,260
that's a good point.
That's a good point.

3463
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:54,030
Yeah.
He's balling out of control.

3464
02:22:54,390 --> 02:22:57,720
I wonder what it would take him.
I mean now that he had that big crazy

3465
02:22:57,721 --> 02:23:02,721
fight at the fight and when he jumped
over the fence and pushed referee Mark

3466
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:05,580
Goddard,
I wonder what it would take to get him

3467
02:23:05,581 --> 02:23:07,980
back in the cage now.
Like one of it's going to be fines and

3468
02:23:07,981 --> 02:23:09,750
suspensions.
I wonder what the fuck is going to

3469
02:23:09,751 --> 02:23:11,460
happen.
It's quite fascinating,

3470
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:12,840
but I'll tell you one thing.

3471
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:15,330
He makes things fun.
He does.

3472
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:17,790
It makes things fun.
With Oscar de la Hoya is hitting the

3473
02:23:17,791 --> 02:23:20,370
heavy bag on.
He should say that he'll fight Oscar de

3474
02:23:20,370 --> 02:23:21,960
la Hoya,
but only if Oscar agrees to wear a

3475
02:23:21,961 --> 02:23:24,080
skirt.
You got to wear a skirt and you've got

3476
02:23:24,081 --> 02:23:25,890
to wear fishnet stockings and I'll
fucking fight.

3477
02:23:25,891 --> 02:23:28,590
You think there's anything still too.
I've heard Roy Jones is still trying to

3478
02:23:28,591 --> 02:23:30,570
fight Silva,
which I don't know.

3479
02:23:30,571 --> 02:23:32,350
Is there any kind of,
not that it's going to happen,

3480
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:34,140
but the undersigned does not take that
bait.

3481
02:23:34,770 --> 02:23:35,521
Yeah,
you have.

3482
02:23:35,521 --> 02:23:37,200
Roy Jones is,
I mean,

3483
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:41,910
you see what happened when floyd fought
connor and connor is in his prime.

3484
02:23:42,270 --> 02:23:44,340
You know,
and I'm not saying that Roy Johnson his

3485
02:23:44,341 --> 02:23:45,630
prime,
but he's still very active.

3486
02:23:45,631 --> 02:23:47,910
He still fights.
Roy works out all the time and he

3487
02:23:47,911 --> 02:23:52,410
knocked out some uh,
amateur boxer MMA fighter last year.

3488
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:54,120
He had some,
some fight.

3489
02:23:54,210 --> 02:23:56,850
Remember that like there was like a
contest to see who gets to fight him.

3490
02:23:56,870 --> 02:23:59,060
Yeah.
He Kao that guy with one punch a dinners

3491
02:23:59,061 --> 02:24:00,730
and get suspended for his,
uh,

3492
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:01,890
yeah.
Yeah.

3493
02:24:01,930 --> 02:24:04,200
Anderson's going to be suspended for
quite a while.

3494
02:24:04,430 --> 02:24:05,280
Oh really?
Yeah.

3495
02:24:05,281 --> 02:24:06,021
Once,
if,

3496
02:24:06,021 --> 02:24:09,450
if he indeed is guilty.
Let me just preface that.

3497
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:12,150
If he indeed is guilty and uh,
they,

3498
02:24:13,050 --> 02:24:14,610
they don't have any reason to believe
he's not.

3499
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:16,110
What's your,
um,

3500
02:24:16,590 --> 02:24:18,750
what do you think is the move for conor
mcgregor?

3501
02:24:18,751 --> 02:24:18,900
Sure.

3502
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:23,900
The fight Manny Pacquiao or tiny tube
made of gold can feel it with diamonds.

3503
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:25,530
Haband trash.
Wow.

3504
02:24:26,130 --> 02:24:29,020
Oh,
till I get tired of doing it every day.

3505
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:30,210
Crap.
Image oxide.

3506
02:24:30,211 --> 02:24:35,160
We fucking drank and had we,
during constraint the Tardis whiskey,

3507
02:24:35,730 --> 02:24:38,520
I drink a fucking gun barrel full of
Viagra,

3508
02:24:39,130 --> 02:24:42,870
gone barrel,
make my way to the pool and just started

3509
02:24:42,871 --> 02:24:47,870
shooting rounds off.
That's not a bad or good,

3510
02:24:47,970 --> 02:24:48,803
it's not a good time,

3511
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:51,040
uh,
iconic mcgregor accent.

3512
02:24:51,041 --> 02:24:54,010
But is it good or lucky charms?
I would hire the most beautiful,

3513
02:24:54,011 --> 02:24:57,190
huge volleyball player,
women to just carry me everywhere.

3514
02:24:57,540 --> 02:24:58,390
Hmm.
Yeah.

3515
02:24:58,391 --> 02:25:03,100
Just to get giant super athlete women
and just carry you everywhere.

3516
02:25:03,130 --> 02:25:05,550
Do you think he fights Tony Ferguson or
does he fight?

3517
02:25:05,590 --> 02:25:07,480
That's the Moon Manny Pacquiao.
He used to be,

3518
02:25:07,481 --> 02:25:09,250
not the move,
but I think Tony Ferguson,

3519
02:25:09,310 --> 02:25:12,490
like I think Eddie Bravo had a real good
point about it when he and me and

3520
02:25:12,491 --> 02:25:14,980
Brendan talked about it.
I think Tony Ferguson,

3521
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,280
uh,
is the right move as far as for the

3522
02:25:17,290 --> 02:25:18,550
fans.
I think,

3523
02:25:18,551 --> 02:25:19,480
uh,
over many.

3524
02:25:19,870 --> 02:25:21,580
Yeah.
I don't think that's smart.

3525
02:25:21,581 --> 02:25:22,990
I think if he wants to do a,
um,

3526
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,010
a boxing match,

3527
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:26,260
the real smart move,
be fun an mma fight and then fight a

3528
02:25:26,261 --> 02:25:28,150
boxing match in a year.
Uh,

3529
02:25:28,151 --> 02:25:29,320
but I think that,
um,

3530
02:25:30,050 --> 02:25:31,750
uh,
the Habib Nambucca madoff fight,

3531
02:25:31,751 --> 02:25:35,080
you've really got to see he'll be fight
somebody else first and the nate diaz

3532
02:25:35,081 --> 02:25:37,630
fight,
although it could be huge.

3533
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:39,940
Nate's not really fighting anybody right
now.

3534
02:25:39,970 --> 02:25:41,770
I would,
what I would like right now,

3535
02:25:41,771 --> 02:25:43,090
this is my thought,
I think nate,

3536
02:25:43,091 --> 02:25:46,360
if nate comes back at fight,
someone who wins conor fight someone and

3537
02:25:46,361 --> 02:25:48,130
wins.
Connor is a boxing match.

3538
02:25:48,131 --> 02:25:51,530
They have a huge mma fight after that
fucking huge,

3539
02:25:52,150 --> 02:25:55,750
goddammit.
I mean 3 million pay per view buys huge,

3540
02:25:55,751 --> 02:25:58,510
gigantic.
He's got a ton of conor mcgregor.

3541
02:25:58,520 --> 02:25:59,800
Yes.
That's the fight.

3542
02:25:59,801 --> 02:26:00,634
It's going to get through it.
Yeah,

3543
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:04,120
but that's a big fight.
He might not even have to get through

3544
02:26:04,121 --> 02:26:09,121
that if he can lose but lose in a
respectable manner,

3545
02:26:09,430 --> 02:26:13,780
like lose a very close five round
decision where it's like a nail biter

3546
02:26:13,930 --> 02:26:16,930
where at the end of the rank and,
Ooh,

3547
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:20,110
and then Tony Ferguson drops the ground
and was like fuck.

3548
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:23,890
And then there's like controversy.
I thought conor won and the people that

3549
02:26:23,891 --> 02:26:27,430
the pundents we'll debate it online if
he can lose a fight like that.

3550
02:26:27,550 --> 02:26:29,590
Yes.
But if Tony Lights him up,

3551
02:26:29,591 --> 02:26:33,520
crack some darce choke some puts them
out in the first round and then spits on

3552
02:26:33,521 --> 02:26:35,740
his dick.
Yeah.

3553
02:26:35,990 --> 02:26:37,840
Yeah.
Then the nate diaz fight isn't worth a

3554
02:26:37,841 --> 02:26:38,674
lot.
But yeah,

3555
02:26:39,130 --> 02:26:41,170
if he can do that,
he's like,

3556
02:26:41,171 --> 02:26:44,710
he's so loved by Ireland that he could
almost do anything.

3557
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:46,420
You know,
like Daniel Cormier,

3558
02:26:46,421 --> 02:26:48,370
you said this to me,
we were at a fight.

3559
02:26:48,580 --> 02:26:51,940
It was in between while we're doing the
standup thing where like,

3560
02:26:51,941 --> 02:26:53,650
you know,
they set you up at the microphones and

3561
02:26:53,651 --> 02:26:55,510
you give your analysis about the
upcoming main event,

3562
02:26:55,511 --> 02:26:57,280
that kind of Shit.
And we're looking at each other and he

3563
02:26:57,281 --> 02:26:59,680
goes,
he doesn't lose anything when he loses.

3564
02:26:59,710 --> 02:27:00,700
He goes,
that's what's crazy.

3565
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:01,573
Yeah.
He goes,

3566
02:27:01,720 --> 02:27:04,600
he loses a fight and the support is
exactly where it is,

3567
02:27:04,601 --> 02:27:05,730
if not more.
That's right.

3568
02:27:06,010 --> 02:27:06,441
He's like,
yeah,

3569
02:27:06,441 --> 02:27:08,830
I'd never seen anything like it.
They applied as courage.

3570
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:11,290
He's just so brave.
Like he just puts on the line.

3571
02:27:11,291 --> 02:27:13,090
There's definitely that.
There's definitely,

3572
02:27:13,091 --> 02:27:15,610
except what he says is definitely that
crazy.

3573
02:27:15,820 --> 02:27:18,530
The fact that he came back and beat Ne,
cause I said that Brendan,

3574
02:27:18,550 --> 02:27:21,370
after I saw him lose a person that I go,
nate's just too big for him.

3575
02:27:21,570 --> 02:27:22,780
Big came back,
beat him.

3576
02:27:22,910 --> 02:27:26,800
Yeah.
And then and then and then knocks out in

3577
02:27:26,801 --> 02:27:29,590
the first round.
Knockout Eddie Alvarez second.

3578
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:31,170
The second rounds aren't lit him up.
Sorry.

3579
02:27:31,580 --> 02:27:32,750
Unbelievable.
Like I was like,

3580
02:27:32,860 --> 02:27:34,630
what was the second round?
Wasn't it?

3581
02:27:35,610 --> 02:27:37,570
I want to say a second round.
I want to say made it to the,

3582
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,220
I want to say they were coaching them.

3583
02:27:39,220 --> 02:27:42,970
It's fascinating man.
It's like to see him kind of back it up.

3584
02:27:42,971 --> 02:27:45,250
That's what they applaud.
Just his courage and his spirit.

3585
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:46,473
It's also,
he's,

3586
02:27:46,480 --> 02:27:48,460
he's a great shit talker.
Yes.

3587
02:27:48,461 --> 02:27:51,130
That's a big part of this.
He's fun to listen to.

3588
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:54,080
Great dresses.
Look at the way you dress to doing

3589
02:27:54,081 --> 02:27:54,940
second round.
Yeah.

3590
02:27:55,250 --> 02:27:57,190
Khabib needs to fight at one 70 there.
I said,

3591
02:27:57,210 --> 02:28:00,760
well you say that,
but he's got a new nutritionist and

3592
02:28:00,761 --> 02:28:04,090
Corina was telling me that he's having a
way less problems with his weight now.

3593
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:05,650
He's 25 no,
no,

3594
02:28:05,651 --> 02:28:06,131
no.
He's not eating.

3595
02:28:06,131 --> 02:28:06,731
Okay.
No,

3596
02:28:06,731 --> 02:28:08,440
that he's in the one seven he's now.
Really?

3597
02:28:08,450 --> 02:28:09,161
Yeah.
Yeah.

3598
02:28:09,161 --> 02:28:11,620
That he's like way lighter now than he's
ever been.

3599
02:28:11,621 --> 02:28:16,240
Any time close to a fight and that he'll
have way less problem making weight for

3600
02:28:16,241 --> 02:28:18,670
this fight and they've got them on a
very strict nutrition schedule now

3601
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:22,010
because he's fighting his team.
Yeah.

3602
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:24,130
My coworker Tammy,
for me,

3603
02:28:24,140 --> 02:28:28,640
I tells me I'm sure much rockhold luke
walks around at two 15 you know,

3604
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:33,080
I've listened to him.
It doesn't make near megabit off bigger.

3605
02:28:33,081 --> 02:28:34,070
You understand how that works,
right?

3606
02:28:34,071 --> 02:28:35,210
Right.
No,

3607
02:28:35,211 --> 02:28:40,130
it never like he looks at Luke posted a
picture of him training with Khabib and

3608
02:28:40,131 --> 02:28:41,690
I was like,
who's the giant?

3609
02:28:41,691 --> 02:28:44,450
And it was done.
Like he's one of the most impressive

3610
02:28:44,451 --> 02:28:46,970
grapplers I've ever seen in MMA.
Yeah.

3611
02:28:47,150 --> 02:28:50,000
It's ability to take guys who are very
good,

3612
02:28:50,390 --> 02:28:52,150
you know,
like Javiel dos Anjos and just sorta

3613
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:55,220
ragdoll of wow.
He's his wrestling is.

3614
02:28:55,550 --> 02:28:56,720
It is.
It is.

3615
02:28:56,721 --> 02:28:57,620
It's,
it's stunning.

3616
02:28:57,770 --> 02:29:01,100
It's a different kind of Russ because I
think dos Anjos is better now than he

3617
02:29:01,101 --> 02:29:03,050
was during that fight,
but it doesn't matter.

3618
02:29:03,051 --> 02:29:03,381
It's like,
well,

3619
02:29:03,381 --> 02:29:04,520
the way he did it to him,
it's like,

3620
02:29:04,521 --> 02:29:09,500
man,
if there's levels where it's hard to

3621
02:29:09,501 --> 02:29:11,510
tell with them,
it may because strikings and fault when

3622
02:29:11,570 --> 02:29:15,050
strikings involved the,
you don't get to see the pure grappling

3623
02:29:15,051 --> 02:29:15,650
level.

3624
02:29:15,650 --> 02:29:18,170
But what I was seeing when I was seeing
just pure,

3625
02:29:18,171 --> 02:29:21,650
just pure grappling,
I would see in strength endurance

3626
02:29:21,651 --> 02:29:25,190
technique there.
It was just like 30% like they're

3627
02:29:25,191 --> 02:29:27,860
stacked up on number grammatical.
She gets a hold of you.

3628
02:29:27,990 --> 02:29:29,420
Yeah.
You're not getting him off.

3629
02:29:29,421 --> 02:29:32,060
He got Mowgli Javery yeah.
Nobody gets him off.

3630
02:29:32,061 --> 02:29:33,320
Look at the size of it could be a
breath.

3631
02:29:33,340 --> 02:29:35,300
Yeah.
But now I might be the camera angled,

3632
02:29:35,301 --> 02:29:36,800
but it could be,
but he's,

3633
02:29:36,801 --> 02:29:38,150
you know,
he's in front and,

3634
02:29:38,151 --> 02:29:38,811
but he's,
you know,

3635
02:29:38,811 --> 02:29:40,420
he's not cutting weight right there or
he's,

3636
02:29:40,460 --> 02:29:41,271
if he is,
he's,

3637
02:29:41,271 --> 02:29:43,040
you know,
halfway into the game.

3638
02:29:43,190 --> 02:29:44,690
Yeah.
He's a monster man.

3639
02:29:44,750 --> 02:29:47,180
He does.
I think he does really well at 72 that's

3640
02:29:47,181 --> 02:29:49,130
what I'm saying.
He posted something on his instagram.

3641
02:29:49,131 --> 02:29:52,610
This is a show you,
why motherfuckers so hard and why all

3642
02:29:52,611 --> 02:29:54,140
those people from Dagestan so hard.

3643
02:29:54,380 --> 02:29:56,720
He posted something on his instagram,
one of his friends who had been

3644
02:29:56,721 --> 02:29:59,930
tortured,
no posted photos of his friend who had

3645
02:29:59,931 --> 02:30:01,640
his stomach cut open.
Yeah.

3646
02:30:01,641 --> 02:30:03,530
He put posted on his,
in his,

3647
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:04,610
uh,
instagram.

3648
02:30:04,611 --> 02:30:05,360
This,
this guy,

3649
02:30:05,360 --> 02:30:07,700
there's two photos,
there's this photo and then there's the

3650
02:30:07,701 --> 02:30:10,940
next one.
And this guy had his stomach cut open.

3651
02:30:10,941 --> 02:30:13,340
They were tortured him about something.
And there's a translation,

3652
02:30:13,341 --> 02:30:16,260
you can translate all of it,
but it has something you,

3653
02:30:16,540 --> 02:30:18,650
him saying that someone was wrongly
accused,

3654
02:30:18,651 --> 02:30:22,580
they were trying to get him to confess.
But the point is this is a UFC number

3655
02:30:22,581 --> 02:30:25,040
one contender,
or at least number two in the

3656
02:30:25,041 --> 02:30:27,290
lightweight division,
one of the most towns fact divisions in

3657
02:30:27,291 --> 02:30:30,350
the world.
And he's posting stuff on his page about

3658
02:30:30,351 --> 02:30:33,860
how hard his environment is that people
are being tortured.

3659
02:30:33,861 --> 02:30:34,694
Yeah.
He's,

3660
02:30:34,700 --> 02:30:36,440
when he gets in there,
his mind,

3661
02:30:36,530 --> 02:30:37,670
I mean you're,
you're fighting,

3662
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:38,820
literally fighting.

3663
02:30:38,960 --> 02:30:41,180
He calls himself the Eagle.
He's like a fucking eagle.

3664
02:30:41,181 --> 02:30:44,330
Yes.
I mean he's fucking for Roche's when he

3665
02:30:44,331 --> 02:30:47,330
gets in there and he's at a level of
grappling,

3666
02:30:47,331 --> 02:30:47,781
like,
man,

3667
02:30:47,781 --> 02:30:52,781
he's been doing it his whole like crazy.
And at an intense super primal level,

3668
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:55,280
you know,
so intense,

3669
02:30:55,281 --> 02:30:58,430
real technical,
super knowledgeable about wrestling and

3670
02:30:58,431 --> 02:31:02,100
Jujitsu and submissions.
I think Daniel said that they liked,

3671
02:31:02,110 --> 02:31:06,770
they basically tussled for 15 minutes.
Damn Daniel the Olympian.

3672
02:31:07,090 --> 02:31:08,410
Yeah,
he said it was hand fighting with them.

3673
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:10,940
He like Whoa Shit.
It's like he's a beast,

3674
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:14,000
never coming off as a beast.
And when you see him get a guy like

3675
02:31:14,001 --> 02:31:16,310
Michael Johnson down in the ground and
just own him,

3676
02:31:16,580 --> 02:31:18,350
he owned and he was saying,
look,

3677
02:31:18,351 --> 02:31:20,190
I'm sorry I gotta do this to you man,
but you gotta tap

3678
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:20,641
like,
um,

3679
02:31:20,641 --> 02:31:23,520
I need my title shot.
Nobody saying guys beating the fuck out

3680
02:31:23,521 --> 02:31:24,150
of him,
man.

3681
02:31:24,150 --> 02:31:25,990
He was just holding him down and
pounding on him.

3682
02:31:25,991 --> 02:31:28,050
Yeah,
it was really hard for me to watch cause

3683
02:31:28,110 --> 02:31:31,230
one thing I'm like,
I'm impressed with Michael Johnson's

3684
02:31:32,010 --> 02:31:35,670
complete unwillingness to tap just,
he just like beat me up,

3685
02:31:35,671 --> 02:31:37,770
keep beating me up cause we're fighting
through it.

3686
02:31:38,100 --> 02:31:41,640
And then he eventually got Kimora but it
was just ruthless man.

3687
02:31:41,641 --> 02:31:44,280
Yeah,
it was ruthless and the control that he

3688
02:31:44,281 --> 02:31:47,100
had on him,
just his arm tied up and just beating

3689
02:31:47,101 --> 02:31:48,180
the shit out of all.
I was like,

3690
02:31:48,210 --> 02:31:49,830
wow,
this guys,

3691
02:31:50,020 --> 02:31:51,630
there's,
there's certain positions where you see

3692
02:31:51,631 --> 02:31:54,750
a guy so much better at a god that he's
not done and then a guy that,

3693
02:31:54,751 --> 02:31:56,310
the guy who's holding down just not
going to get up.

3694
02:31:56,570 --> 02:31:59,070
It's not going to get up.
So matter of time before he gets beaten

3695
02:31:59,071 --> 02:32:00,060
into unconsciousness,
right.

3696
02:32:00,940 --> 02:32:03,870
Jacques are raised the same way and when
[inaudible] gets on top of you or get

3697
02:32:03,871 --> 02:32:04,900
you down,
you,

3698
02:32:04,910 --> 02:32:07,070
you know,
unless you're a little Yoel Romero your,

3699
02:32:07,110 --> 02:32:08,140
we'll see you later.
Yeah.

3700
02:32:08,141 --> 02:32:11,970
See how he's got his right arm tied up.
He just clamps down on his wrist and his

3701
02:32:11,971 --> 02:32:15,260
right arm became,
he became a one arm defensive guys.

3702
02:32:15,270 --> 02:32:17,820
Just the guys been fighting and his
whole like wrestling his whole life.

3703
02:32:17,821 --> 02:32:20,580
So fine details.
It's fucking details though.

3704
02:32:20,581 --> 02:32:22,310
It's where his hips are.
It's all the minutia,

3705
02:32:22,330 --> 02:32:25,200
the micro movements that any,
any ways.

3706
02:32:25,201 --> 02:32:27,210
He probably feels like he weighs 300
pounds.

3707
02:32:27,240 --> 02:32:29,160
I'm sure like those wrestlers like that,
like,

3708
02:32:29,161 --> 02:32:30,380
you know,
the,

3709
02:32:30,381 --> 02:32:31,141
the,
when you,

3710
02:32:31,141 --> 02:32:33,600
when you tussle with a guy who's been
doing it his whole life,

3711
02:32:33,601 --> 02:32:34,650
he can make him,
he can,

3712
02:32:34,710 --> 02:32:37,620
he can tap you.
If you're a regular guy by putting his

3713
02:32:37,621 --> 02:32:38,130
weight on you.

3714
02:32:38,130 --> 02:32:38,910
After a while,
you'll just,

3715
02:32:38,910 --> 02:32:42,330
you'll just tap and which ben her and
it's going to be on the podcast.

3716
02:32:42,390 --> 02:32:44,680
Oh,
I'm working it out with Ben astron going

3717
02:32:44,810 --> 02:32:46,290
to get them out here.
Finally,

3718
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:51,060
I've been a ben ask a ball rider the
killer for several years.

3719
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:54,360
Not Technically a Dick Rider Paul rider
or have a ball.

3720
02:32:54,361 --> 02:32:55,710
Right?
The Dick is so deep in it.

3721
02:32:56,610 --> 02:32:59,030
Now you're riding his girls over there.
I write,

3722
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:00,870
I hold on the balls.
I look up at the day.

3723
02:33:01,140 --> 02:33:02,380
How much does he weigh?
Well,

3724
02:33:02,381 --> 02:33:04,650
what is he fights at one 70.
Uh,

3725
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:06,070
okay,
so he's one seven athletic.

3726
02:33:06,071 --> 02:33:07,340
If I was 30,
50 or something,

3727
02:33:07,350 --> 02:33:10,560
cuts some weight for sure,
but I don't think he cuts a lot of

3728
02:33:10,561 --> 02:33:11,191
weight.
I mean,

3729
02:33:11,191 --> 02:33:13,950
it's not one of the bigger guys in the
division and he's just super technical.

3730
02:33:13,951 --> 02:33:15,360
This wrestling.
He was his,

3731
02:33:15,361 --> 02:33:16,290
uh,
where do you learn?

3732
02:33:16,950 --> 02:33:20,670
Well,
he is a fucking serious world class

3733
02:33:20,671 --> 02:33:22,170
amateur wrestler.
I mean,

3734
02:33:22,171 --> 02:33:23,340
do you know?
Yeah.

3735
02:33:23,341 --> 02:33:24,760
Before I thought he was just Jujitsu
tits.

3736
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:27,780
No.
Ben Asker and pull up Ben aspirins

3737
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:30,300
record.
You could see his collegic wrestling

3738
02:33:30,301 --> 02:33:32,700
record.
He was a fucking monster at that hair.

3739
02:33:33,150 --> 02:33:34,620
Powerful Missouri.
Look at that.

3740
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:36,540
Uh,
if you,

3741
02:33:36,541 --> 02:33:37,770
uh,
pull up his record,

3742
02:33:37,771 --> 02:33:41,650
those wikipedia record and he does a lot
of work with a lot of Duke roufus.

3743
02:33:41,651 --> 02:33:43,130
This guy's too.
Yeah.

3744
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:45,330
Um,
he's has always been a corner man.

3745
02:33:45,331 --> 02:33:46,650
I've always seen him at the UFC.
He's,

3746
02:33:46,860 --> 02:33:48,120
yeah,
he just had,

3747
02:33:48,150 --> 02:33:52,020
he had some sort of an issue with the
post Olympic career.

3748
02:33:52,021 --> 02:33:56,820
So like what is the Olympic Games?
He was in Beijing.

3749
02:33:57,080 --> 02:33:59,070
Well,
what did he win in the Olympics?

3750
02:33:59,580 --> 02:34:02,340
He lost one.
Any one one.

3751
02:34:02,341 --> 02:34:03,810
Is that what it says?
Wow.

3752
02:34:04,340 --> 02:34:06,900
You know,
phenomenal wrestler.

3753
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:07,711
I mean,
just phenomenal.

3754
02:34:07,711 --> 02:34:10,890
And he's retiring undefeated as a mixed
martial artist.

3755
02:34:10,891 --> 02:34:12,840
He just a,
I think he just beat Aoki.

3756
02:34:12,841 --> 02:34:15,900
I think that was his main,
his a retirement fight.

3757
02:34:16,260 --> 02:34:18,010
Wow.
One on another contest

3758
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:20,320
after the Olympics.
To Dave Schultz Memorial International.

3759
02:34:20,321 --> 02:34:21,510
He Won.
MMM,

3760
02:34:21,880 --> 02:34:22,740
probably,
yeah,

3761
02:34:22,750 --> 02:34:26,260
probably over middle or defeated a
silver medalist in another tournaments.

3762
02:34:26,350 --> 02:34:27,310
Interesting.
Um,

3763
02:34:27,311 --> 02:34:30,850
go to his MMA career because I want to
see who he just beat for his retirement

3764
02:34:30,851 --> 02:34:32,560
fight cause he just had,
it was retirement fight.

3765
02:34:33,130 --> 02:34:35,950
Yeah.
Shinya Aoki who at one point in time was

3766
02:34:35,951 --> 02:34:37,240
one of the most,
uh,

3767
02:34:37,270 --> 02:34:39,520
exciting submission guys in the world.
And he was

3768
02:34:41,130 --> 02:34:42,380
right.
Uh,

3769
02:34:42,460 --> 02:34:46,960
did she tapped out by Nick Diaz?
He used to wear tights.

3770
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:49,780
That's what I'm still fighting though.
You seen that was recent?

3771
02:34:50,050 --> 02:34:51,840
Yeah.
Aoki just fought Ben Aspirin.

3772
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:54,460
I didn't know basketball was still
fighting.

3773
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:56,470
Yeah,
this was his retirement fight.

3774
02:34:56,471 --> 02:34:58,600
He just had like,
just had it like last week.

3775
02:34:58,660 --> 02:34:59,500
Wow.
Yeah.

3776
02:34:59,570 --> 02:35:02,270
I sent him a congratulations and I said,
let's do a podcast.

3777
02:35:02,830 --> 02:35:04,930
He had a twin brother or am I thinking
of Matt Hughes?

3778
02:35:04,970 --> 02:35:09,420
You're thinking of Matt Hughes.
Are you sure to have a twin brother too?

3779
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,510
Might as well.
I don't know.

3780
02:35:10,550 --> 02:35:11,650
And,
and but uh,

3781
02:35:11,710 --> 02:35:12,940
let me ask you,
this.

3782
02:35:12,970 --> 02:35:15,250
Does,
why was Matt Hughes Doing,

3783
02:35:15,251 --> 02:35:16,540
do you know?
He's doing better?

3784
02:35:16,541 --> 02:35:19,120
Apparently they're really excited about
his progress.

3785
02:35:19,121 --> 02:35:21,180
You know,
he was in a coma for quite a while from

3786
02:35:21,181 --> 02:35:23,050
the,
apparently what they're saying is that

3787
02:35:23,051 --> 02:35:26,440
he thought that he could make it across
the tracks and then if you waited,

3788
02:35:26,441 --> 02:35:28,780
the train takes like 10 minutes to go or
tearing or attendance,

3789
02:35:28,830 --> 02:35:31,270
fucking giant ass train.
So he took a chance and he hit some

3790
02:35:31,271 --> 02:35:34,300
gravel and he was able to sell.
I worked with them on warrior and you

3791
02:35:34,301 --> 02:35:35,560
know what he said to me?
Well he goes,

3792
02:35:35,561 --> 02:35:38,770
I just hope I can put my shoes on,
put my own shoes.

3793
02:35:38,771 --> 02:35:40,720
I when I'm 70,
I can like he cause he,

3794
02:35:40,721 --> 02:35:41,770
he worked,
we were talking about head,

3795
02:35:41,860 --> 02:35:42,350
head trauma.

3796
02:35:42,350 --> 02:35:45,490
He worries about it.
He says about all should he should,

3797
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:47,380
you know,
and towards the end of his career he

3798
02:35:47,381 --> 02:35:48,880
developed a,
um,

3799
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:52,870
a compromise chin.
It's the best way to put it.

3800
02:35:52,900 --> 02:35:54,630
Like you could see like everybody,
j pen,

3801
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:56,380
brain shut down.
Does everybody,

3802
02:35:56,381 --> 02:35:59,350
does chuck the Dal who had the,
probably one of the greatest chins of

3803
02:35:59,351 --> 02:36:01,480
all time,
he exhibited it later in his career.

3804
02:36:01,481 --> 02:36:03,550
He just couldn't take shots anymore
because your body goes,

3805
02:36:03,551 --> 02:36:04,480
oh,
I've been here before.

3806
02:36:04,481 --> 02:36:06,220
I see a letter and shuts down.
Yup.

3807
02:36:06,410 --> 02:36:11,410
It makes sense.
A guy who is just rock solid for Rosha

3808
02:36:11,511 --> 02:36:14,050
says Chuck Liddell,
he just a walkthrough bombs.

3809
02:36:14,051 --> 02:36:16,990
Guys are just throw bombs on him.
He'd walk through them at the end of his

3810
02:36:16,991 --> 02:36:18,190
career,
he could not do that anymore.

3811
02:36:18,610 --> 02:36:19,690
So interesting.
How your,

3812
02:36:19,720 --> 02:36:22,660
how a lactone of fighting makes you more
fragile,

3813
02:36:22,850 --> 02:36:23,290
you know?

3814
02:36:23,290 --> 02:36:25,330
Yeah.
I mean your body's just not designed for

3815
02:36:25,331 --> 02:36:28,720
that.
He did an x ray of his face and he has a

3816
02:36:28,721 --> 02:36:31,810
micro fractures all through his face and
he said,

3817
02:36:31,811 --> 02:36:34,330
and the doctor said it's very common
with fighters and football players

3818
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:37,540
choose corona.
Just micro just cracks all through your

3819
02:36:37,541 --> 02:36:38,740
math.
Oh my God.

3820
02:36:38,741 --> 02:36:39,600
Of course.
Yeah.

3821
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:42,940
You think about Brendan Spar and Shane
car when all the times getting mugged.

3822
02:36:42,970 --> 02:36:47,110
How about getting punched full on and
having his nose shattered by Cro cop?

3823
02:36:47,140 --> 02:36:48,230
It was an elbow,
in fact.

3824
02:36:48,270 --> 02:36:50,260
Yeah.
And still coming back.

3825
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:51,500
Lamb.
Yeah.

3826
02:36:52,060 --> 02:36:55,150
Took shots.
Took some good shots from a big country

3827
02:36:55,151 --> 02:36:57,970
before he got hit behind the ear.
He watched that fight.

3828
02:36:58,010 --> 02:36:58,631
Well,
boom.

3829
02:36:58,631 --> 02:37:02,710
Ben Rothwell caled him
Big Ben.

3830
02:37:03,460 --> 02:37:05,050
He's another guy.
Like what happened with him?

3831
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:06,730
He got caught with something,
right?

3832
02:37:06,910 --> 02:37:09,160
Yeah,
man.

3833
02:37:09,210 --> 02:37:10,420
Ask him,
does not have a twin brother.

3834
02:37:10,510 --> 02:37:12,550
I know.
He's got a brother.

3835
02:37:13,090 --> 02:37:13,923
Oh,
there it is.

3836
02:37:14,050 --> 02:37:15,410
There you go.
That's her brothers.

3837
02:37:15,710 --> 02:37:16,190
I think

3838
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:18,140
one of the things that,
um,

3839
02:37:18,230 --> 02:37:21,920
I mean when you're talking about in
these,

3840
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,350
the fucking athletes that we're dealing
with today,

3841
02:37:24,980 --> 02:37:26,900
you know,
he talking with like what they're

3842
02:37:26,901 --> 02:37:29,300
experiencing.
I think with medical science,

3843
02:37:30,110 --> 02:37:33,590
I bet like in 50 60 years we're going to
be looking back and they're going to be

3844
02:37:33,591 --> 02:37:34,640
going,
God damn,

3845
02:37:34,641 --> 02:37:36,110
man,
these people couldn't even take blah,

3846
02:37:36,111 --> 02:37:38,240
blah,
blah to fix their problem.

3847
02:37:38,570 --> 02:37:40,070
They couldn't even go to the blah,
blah,

3848
02:37:40,071 --> 02:37:43,760
blah machine to fix their brain and they
just had to have bad brains.

3849
02:37:43,761 --> 02:37:43,960
Right?

3850
02:37:43,960 --> 02:37:46,620
Remember what Robert Sapolsky said in
your podcast last time?

3851
02:37:46,621 --> 02:37:47,670
He said,
I thought it was amazing.

3852
02:37:47,970 --> 02:37:48,721
He says,
we learn more.

3853
02:37:48,721 --> 02:37:49,640
What do you think's going to happen?
He said,

3854
02:37:49,641 --> 02:37:51,390
I think in like 20,
30,

3855
02:37:51,391 --> 02:37:52,180
40 years,
we're going to go,

3856
02:37:52,180 --> 02:37:54,780
my God,
look at the way we treated people who

3857
02:37:54,781 --> 02:37:57,450
killed and who did things that were
impulsive.

3858
02:37:57,480 --> 02:37:59,970
They,
their brains were just fucked up and we

3859
02:37:59,971 --> 02:38:01,160
didn't know how to fix him well,

3860
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:03,370
just that he,
um,

3861
02:38:03,500 --> 02:38:06,290
he was not just talking about their
brains being fucked up.

3862
02:38:06,291 --> 02:38:10,760
He was saying that the idea of free will
is a ridiculous concept that's ingrained

3863
02:38:10,761 --> 02:38:12,980
in the psyche of the American people in
particular.

3864
02:38:13,340 --> 02:38:14,650
And that's a Christian idea.
Yeah.

3865
02:38:14,750 --> 02:38:18,050
But it's also that you as a scientist,
the way he looks at things,

3866
02:38:18,051 --> 02:38:20,120
I mean,
he's boiling things down to the fucking,

3867
02:38:20,510 --> 02:38:22,130
the,
the very atomic level.

3868
02:38:22,400 --> 02:38:26,390
And he's essentially saying that your
behavior has been determined by your

3869
02:38:26,391 --> 02:38:27,950
environment,
by your genes,

3870
02:38:27,951 --> 02:38:31,540
by year.
The experiences that you've had by all

3871
02:38:31,541 --> 02:38:31,730
of this,

3872
02:38:31,730 --> 02:38:35,030
things that you've left frontal cortex
may not be as developed because you grew

3873
02:38:35,031 --> 02:38:39,110
up poor and under a lot of stress.
So you make impulsive decisions,

3874
02:38:39,111 --> 02:38:42,230
lack of nutrition.
They got the guy who kidnapped bent girl

3875
02:38:42,231 --> 02:38:44,930
I was talking about.
The young girl had two kids with her

3876
02:38:44,931 --> 02:38:48,620
when she was 13 years.
His father said that he had a motor

3877
02:38:48,660 --> 02:38:50,390
cycle accident.
He was a normal kid,

3878
02:38:50,391 --> 02:38:52,340
and then he had a motorcycle accident.
He was never the same.

3879
02:38:52,680 --> 02:38:53,990
He,
his whole personality,

3880
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,290
just the kinison story,
the kit and got hit by a truck.

3881
02:38:57,440 --> 02:38:59,150
Oh Wow.
Kinison was one kid,

3882
02:38:59,430 --> 02:39:01,220
Sam kinison got hit by a truck and then
he's like,

3883
02:39:01,250 --> 02:39:04,130
wow,
wow,

3884
02:39:05,090 --> 02:39:06,890
wow.
That gut kicking over.

3885
02:39:06,891 --> 02:39:08,390
If you know what else changed your
personality,

3886
02:39:08,391 --> 02:39:09,920
they say sometimes,
which is fascinating.

3887
02:39:09,921 --> 02:39:12,750
Jerking off in your own mouth,
almost almost.

3888
02:39:13,340 --> 02:39:15,280
That would be traumatic.
Changes your personality.

3889
02:39:15,281 --> 02:39:18,590
It would be traumatic for a little bit.
It does a little until you end up liking

3890
02:39:18,591 --> 02:39:20,240
it.
But here's what really changes.

3891
02:39:20,540 --> 02:39:21,930
You're having a heart,
uh,

3892
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:22,970
operation.
Oh,

3893
02:39:22,971 --> 02:39:24,920
that makes sense.
Now what was so weird though,

3894
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:28,370
we'll see for an operation on your heart
and it changes your whole personality.

3895
02:39:28,780 --> 02:39:32,080
Well,
there's one thing about that that Dr.

3896
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:32,291
Mark Gordon,
you know,

3897
02:39:32,291 --> 02:39:37,291
Mark Gordon,
he actually did a paper on um,

3898
02:39:37,890 --> 02:39:42,890
post traumatic surgeries like open heart
surgeries and the effect it has on

3899
02:39:43,751 --> 02:39:48,751
depression and perhaps suppression of
your body's ability to produce hormones.

3900
02:39:49,590 --> 02:39:54,310
There's something about being under
anesthesia for long periods of time with

3901
02:39:54,311 --> 02:39:57,490
very complicated operations.
It leaves people uniquely depressed

3902
02:39:57,491 --> 02:39:58,450
afterwards.
Wow.

3903
02:39:58,570 --> 02:39:59,440
Yeah.
And he was,

3904
02:39:59,470 --> 02:40:03,190
he was telling me about this after the
whole Robin Williams,

3905
02:40:03,191 --> 02:40:06,040
things happen because Robin Williams got
sick,

3906
02:40:06,280 --> 02:40:08,530
he got a heart condition,
he had heart surgery,

3907
02:40:08,531 --> 02:40:10,450
and then he eventually one of committing
suicide.

3908
02:40:10,690 --> 02:40:12,420
And he's like,
I'm not saying it's the core,

3909
02:40:12,460 --> 02:40:14,070
it's the reason Robin Williams

3910
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:17,190
did that,
but there is absolutely some connection

3911
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:22,520
between this compromised hormonal system
and depression and between a compromised

3912
02:40:23,911 --> 02:40:27,510
hormonal system and long operations
while under anesthesia.

3913
02:40:27,511 --> 02:40:28,440
And I was like,
wow.

3914
02:40:28,441 --> 02:40:31,020
Have you had a lot of guys on about the
Gut biome?

3915
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:33,810
Oh yeah.
And how that affects your mood from

3916
02:40:33,811 --> 02:40:36,210
having people on,
from having Chris Kresser on the last

3917
02:40:36,211 --> 02:40:37,380
time he was on,
I changed,

3918
02:40:37,410 --> 02:40:40,200
I'm eating like four cans of Kimchi a
week.

3919
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:42,720
Oh really big ass cans,
man.

3920
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:45,600
I mean fermented cabbage and of course
cause you're an extremist.

3921
02:40:45,630 --> 02:40:47,520
Do you have to eat that much?
I know,

3922
02:40:47,521 --> 02:40:48,900
but listen to me.
Look at me right now.

3923
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:52,920
Who are you the just because fucking
Kim,

3924
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,080
she's good for you.
Doesn't mean you have to eat that much

3925
02:40:55,081 --> 02:40:55,914
proud.
All the,

3926
02:40:56,430 --> 02:40:58,470
you're the,
you're the extreme.

3927
02:40:58,471 --> 02:41:01,350
Can you have a little bit like the way
the Koreans do feel pretty good.

3928
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,480
I know,
but why the fuck he get his weapon?

3929
02:41:03,540 --> 02:41:07,830
He gets bay a piece of information and
he'll just eat bowls of Kimchi.

3930
02:41:07,860 --> 02:41:09,050
Yeah,
I played this video game.

3931
02:41:10,050 --> 02:41:11,460
Fainted.
I fainted.

3932
02:41:11,490 --> 02:41:13,470
I never do that.
But I have bone broth and Kim,

3933
02:41:13,471 --> 02:41:14,740
she of course you do.
Of course you do.

3934
02:41:14,760 --> 02:41:16,730
And I put Habanero sauce in the bone
broth.

3935
02:41:16,770 --> 02:41:20,010
A surprise.
I sweat beads of sweat coming off my

3936
02:41:20,011 --> 02:41:22,140
bald head.
His pouring down of course.

3937
02:41:22,141 --> 02:41:24,990
And I'm eating Spicy Kimchi and I'm
drinking spicy bonus.

3938
02:41:25,010 --> 02:41:26,680
Did you need stream?
Yeah.

3939
02:41:29,470 --> 02:41:31,460
Well want to live forever?
No,

3940
02:41:31,470 --> 02:41:31,790
no,
no.

3941
02:41:31,790 --> 02:41:36,120
And he's in love with mortality.
I told you I any mortality fuck out

3942
02:41:36,121 --> 02:41:38,880
until the lights go off.
This mother fucker is going good.

3943
02:41:39,150 --> 02:41:42,690
I'm going to be dead.
So this engine is perin.

3944
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:44,950
I'm corner in,
everything's listen man.

3945
02:41:44,951 --> 02:41:46,920
If you don't think,
if you think I didn't have a long

3946
02:41:46,921 --> 02:41:51,921
conversation with Mister Justin Ds,
who is Phil Heath's trainer was and he's

3947
02:41:52,210 --> 02:41:54,720
a Mister Olympia guy.
He like trains all those guys.

3948
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:56,450
I talked to him for a lot.
I cut to the chase.

3949
02:41:56,451 --> 02:41:58,260
I go phil,

3956
02:42:10,261 --> 02:42:12,300
hey bro,
let's cut to the chase.

3957
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:14,700
You know everything about nutrition and
everything about weightlifting.

3958
02:42:14,820 --> 02:42:16,470
There's no doubt about how to build
muscle.

3959
02:42:16,471 --> 02:42:20,880
He's a fucking genius.
Talk to him about trt cause I'm 50 and

3960
02:42:20,881 --> 02:42:23,850
it's getting to a point where I'm going
to have to start shooting myself up.

3961
02:42:24,010 --> 02:42:24,420
What?
He said,

3962
02:42:24,420 --> 02:42:26,190
we had a long talk.
Don't worry about it.

3963
02:42:26,220 --> 02:42:29,090
The point is,
I'll be seeing the doctor for the sound.

3964
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:30,180
Look,
if you guys see me,

3965
02:42:30,181 --> 02:42:31,590
really want to start?
No.

3966
02:42:31,670 --> 02:42:32,850
Uh,
she'd say no,

3967
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:34,260
you don't mention it.
I'm not afraid.

3968
02:42:34,290 --> 02:42:35,510
Not Afraid.
You don't have that stuff.

3969
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:37,180
First of all,
she's got a girl for a boyfriend or

3970
02:42:37,181 --> 02:42:38,130
other excuse.
She's got a husband.

3971
02:42:38,280 --> 02:42:40,140
Yes.
I wouldn't even talk about giant man.

3972
02:42:40,950 --> 02:42:42,230
He's a,
he's a very thick rabbet.

3973
02:42:43,210 --> 02:42:44,043
All right.
Sorry.

3974
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:47,170
Sorry man.
Jamie's pulling up pictures of her.

3975
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:48,480
Hey Bro.
I wasn't looking.

3976
02:42:48,481 --> 02:42:51,500
I was just looking at her back,
her back.

3977
02:42:52,380 --> 02:42:56,460
I'm looking at the basket.
Someone else by slaves doesn't mean you

3978
02:42:56,461 --> 02:42:57,900
have to.
You son of a bitch,

3979
02:42:57,901 --> 02:43:01,560
son of a bitch,
probably into orchids to [inaudible] is

3980
02:43:01,561 --> 02:43:05,220
the real problem with the social justice
warrior movement as they eat their own

3981
02:43:05,221 --> 02:43:07,980
to try to take away any sort of blame on
themselves.

3982
02:43:08,070 --> 02:43:10,860
I just think the left,
the liberal left is not,

3983
02:43:10,900 --> 02:43:11,980
that is lost.
Their sense of

3984
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:13,120
humor.
You can't even be funny.

3985
02:43:13,150 --> 02:43:17,020
You can't say anything.
I predict that this is the inevitable

3986
02:43:17,021 --> 02:43:22,021
demise of a vast majority of the
colleges in this country and the people

3987
02:43:22,181 --> 02:43:27,181
are eventually going to learn how to
form communities and learn online.

3988
02:43:28,100 --> 02:43:30,310
Why Jonathan?
You know Jonathan Heit these creating

3989
02:43:30,311 --> 02:43:32,350
the Heterodox Academy,
you know about this?

3990
02:43:32,410 --> 02:43:35,980
No.
So John [inaudible] is a fucking giant.

3991
02:43:36,010 --> 02:43:37,850
Jonathan Heit,
I can't believe you haven't had much

3992
02:43:37,870 --> 02:43:39,010
podcast.
He's a giant.

3993
02:43:39,011 --> 02:43:41,230
He wrote the happiness hypothesis.
Lily fit in this room.

3994
02:43:41,490 --> 02:43:42,450
Ah Yes.
He,

3995
02:43:42,451 --> 02:43:46,600
his brain might not though.
And he basically is a Columbia

3996
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:50,200
University and he was like this place
you got fucking students that can report

3997
02:43:50,201 --> 02:43:54,070
you blindly and then you get called up
in front of a whatever and he

3998
02:43:54,150 --> 02:43:56,680
[inaudible] appropriation of all,
it's 17 to one,

3999
02:43:56,681 --> 02:44:01,681
usually like 1717 to hardcore liberal
sort of leftists and one conservative to

4000
02:44:01,961 --> 02:44:04,120
ever do these colleges like Brown and
Columbia.

4001
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:06,910
And he's,
he said this is orthodox thinking.

4002
02:44:07,060 --> 02:44:10,240
It's so bad that they've created safe
spaces where you're not even allowed to

4003
02:44:10,241 --> 02:44:13,660
hear the other side cause it might be
violent too much.

4004
02:44:13,960 --> 02:44:16,570
So he said,
I'm creating the Jonathan Heit,

4005
02:44:17,070 --> 02:44:19,210
h a.
I.

4006
02:44:19,210 --> 02:44:19,511
D.
T.

4007
02:44:19,511 --> 02:44:21,580
You have to have my various,
he's a fucking,

4008
02:44:21,880 --> 02:44:26,880
he's a genius and he's awesome in every
way and he's so important as a thinker,

4009
02:44:27,250 --> 02:44:29,800
he's been,
he's one of the more influential

4010
02:44:29,801 --> 02:44:32,230
thinkers in the past 30 years.
Really?

4011
02:44:32,440 --> 02:44:35,920
Yes.
Basically proving that intuition and

4012
02:44:35,921 --> 02:44:38,170
that your,
your feelings control so much of your

4013
02:44:38,171 --> 02:44:40,870
thinking.
He's a fucking genius social scientist.

4014
02:44:41,080 --> 02:44:43,780
Anyway,
that's my shout out to Jonathan.

4015
02:44:43,781 --> 02:44:44,950
Hi,
I'm glad I had a chance to talk about

4016
02:44:44,951 --> 02:44:47,020
them,
but powerful shout out to Jonathan Heit.

4017
02:44:47,290 --> 02:44:49,720
Yeah,
but he created the Heterodox Academy.

4018
02:44:49,721 --> 02:44:53,650
He's like,
this orthodox thinking is fucking,

4019
02:44:53,980 --> 02:44:55,860
you know,
is not good for anybody.

4020
02:44:56,330 --> 02:44:59,830
What we talked about earlier,
it's people being tribal idea sex.

4021
02:44:59,830 --> 02:45:03,430
We need idea sex.
Do you remember that thing at University

4022
02:45:03,431 --> 02:45:08,431
of Missouri Without Mama and that guy
was an Asian young student photographer

4023
02:45:08,830 --> 02:45:12,790
and this woman came over and she was
yelling at him to stop taking

4024
02:45:12,791 --> 02:45:15,130
photographs because they had created a
safe space.

4025
02:45:15,590 --> 02:45:17,830
And then she said,
can I get some muscle over here to take

4026
02:45:17,831 --> 02:45:18,850
this photographer out?
He's like,

4027
02:45:18,980 --> 02:45:20,800
this is like the first amendment.
Wow.

4028
02:45:20,860 --> 02:45:22,750
He's like,
I need freedom of speech.

4029
02:45:22,751 --> 02:45:25,960
Freedom of the press.
I was taking photographs like there's an

4030
02:45:25,961 --> 02:45:28,060
event that's happening on public
property here.

4031
02:45:28,061 --> 02:45:29,710
Like what do you,
I'm a part of the school.

4032
02:45:29,711 --> 02:45:31,780
I'm being hired to do this because she's
so,

4033
02:45:31,781 --> 02:45:33,640
she comes over and totalizing them.
She is,

4034
02:45:33,641 --> 02:45:35,200
she's a woman.
She's contacting them.

4035
02:45:35,260 --> 02:45:37,120
She's not even a child.
I mean that's her child.

4036
02:45:37,190 --> 02:45:40,060
She is a professor in training or
something like that.

4037
02:45:40,061 --> 02:45:42,240
Anybody who disagrees,
anybody comes to grace?

4038
02:45:42,250 --> 02:45:43,570
Look at her.
She looks like a fanatic.

4039
02:45:44,860 --> 02:45:46,790
You're need to get out.
I actually don't.

4040
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:47,953
All right.

4041
02:45:54,050 --> 02:45:55,190
Wow.
So crazy.

4042
02:45:55,430 --> 02:45:57,140
She's not very smart.
Well,

4043
02:45:57,141 --> 02:45:59,390
she got caught up in the moment.
You know what I mean?

4044
02:45:59,391 --> 02:46:01,190
That's really what it is.
More than anything.

4045
02:46:01,191 --> 02:46:03,230
She probably thought she could get away
with doing that.

4046
02:46:03,410 --> 02:46:06,110
She didn't realize how crazy it would
seem on camera saying,

4047
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:08,690
I've got some I want,
I need to get some muscle over here.

4048
02:46:08,750 --> 02:46:09,940
She her up.
So she's

4049
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:12,110
chill.
She's thinking the same way.

4050
02:46:12,410 --> 02:46:14,510
Those that are intolerant I thinking,
right.

4051
02:46:14,511 --> 02:46:17,240
She's same methodology or brain works
the same way you're,

4052
02:46:17,241 --> 02:46:19,220
you're in the way.
I'm going to get you out of the way.

4053
02:46:19,250 --> 02:46:20,030
Well,
Isis goes,

4054
02:46:20,030 --> 02:46:22,550
you're not a believer.
No point in trying to convert you.

4055
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:25,670
I'm going to shoot your,
cut your head off because it's the same

4056
02:46:25,671 --> 02:46:27,380
one mentality.
You were totally right.

4057
02:46:27,620 --> 02:46:29,180
You're totally right.
Same methodology.

4058
02:46:29,400 --> 02:46:31,880
Yeah.
And it's also like she's in a heightened

4059
02:46:31,881 --> 02:46:32,810
state,
right?

4060
02:46:32,811 --> 02:46:35,660
She's in the combat state.
She's immediately argumentative.

4061
02:46:35,690 --> 02:46:37,910
The guy's got a camera on her because
you got anybody,

4062
02:46:37,911 --> 02:46:40,500
anybody who disagrees where there's
region evil and false.

4063
02:46:40,760 --> 02:46:41,930
The enemy.
Why racist,

4064
02:46:41,990 --> 02:46:43,100
sexist,
homophobic.

4065
02:46:43,101 --> 02:46:45,750
And when you said when you hit somebody
with racism and you go,

4066
02:46:45,751 --> 02:46:47,900
you're a racist or sexist,
what you do is you shut down the whole

4067
02:46:47,901 --> 02:46:50,810
debate because you just,
you just labeled as very complex human

4068
02:46:50,811 --> 02:46:52,130
being with all kinds of emotions.

4069
02:46:52,150 --> 02:46:53,030
Right?
Who goes through it?

4070
02:46:53,031 --> 02:46:55,070
Some days I'm having a moment.
I fucking hate everybody.

4071
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:57,380
But other days I love everybody and
everybody.

4072
02:46:57,381 --> 02:46:59,030
Then you hate black people,
then you're racing them all.

4073
02:46:59,810 --> 02:47:03,650
But if I'm listening,
I'm listening or day I care about

4074
02:47:03,651 --> 02:47:04,970
terrorists and their mothers and
everything.

4075
02:47:04,971 --> 02:47:05,930
And you know,
it depends.

4076
02:47:05,940 --> 02:47:08,030
We all have moments,
but when you brand somebody,

4077
02:47:08,180 --> 02:47:09,740
what we do is we go,
you're a racist.

4078
02:47:09,741 --> 02:47:11,330
You said one thing,
so you're racist.

4079
02:47:11,360 --> 02:47:13,520
Now I'm going to inflate that.
I'm going to blow that up like a big

4080
02:47:13,521 --> 02:47:17,930
balloon and fucking strap it to your
face and you are out of the conversation

4081
02:47:17,931 --> 02:47:20,810
wherever you've done ever brill cause
you're my competition.

4082
02:47:20,870 --> 02:47:22,340
That's right.
That's right.

4083
02:47:22,520 --> 02:47:26,330
And your ideas,
your ideas might be threatening to me.

4084
02:47:26,390 --> 02:47:27,710
More important.
They're actually,

4085
02:47:27,711 --> 02:47:31,040
they create violence towards me,
therefore I need to save space.

4086
02:47:31,070 --> 02:47:31,701
Oh,
and by the way,

4087
02:47:31,701 --> 02:47:32,510
I have all the answers.

4088
02:47:32,510 --> 02:47:36,260
My side is rooted in the truth and love
plus crabs in a bucket.

4089
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:39,520
I'm trying to push those other clubs
down so I can make my way to the tip of

4090
02:47:39,521 --> 02:47:41,650
the tip.
I love crab metaphors.

4091
02:47:41,651 --> 02:47:42,350
God,
goddammit.

4092
02:47:42,350 --> 02:47:45,140
Best Way to do it is to call other
people racist.

4093
02:47:45,290 --> 02:47:46,130
That's it.
Everybody's like,

4094
02:47:46,131 --> 02:47:46,730
what?
Me?

4095
02:47:46,730 --> 02:47:47,563
What?
What?

4096
02:47:47,590 --> 02:47:48,800
You immediately get people on their
heel.

4097
02:47:48,830 --> 02:47:51,060
Who blood.
We're not racist.

4098
02:47:52,550 --> 02:47:53,870
Sexist tool.
Yup.

4099
02:47:54,830 --> 02:47:56,160
Yup.
Oh Yo,

4100
02:47:57,560 --> 02:47:59,180
what am I saying?
We're not racing this actually with

4101
02:47:59,181 --> 02:48:00,200
tribal,
right?

4102
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:01,900
That's the thing.
There's a smile,

4103
02:48:01,950 --> 02:48:06,140
logical basis to sex,
and that is patriarchal in and of

4104
02:48:06,190 --> 02:48:10,070
itself.
There's no biological basis for sex,

4105
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:12,620
not hormones,
not x,

4106
02:48:12,621 --> 02:48:13,291
Y,
chromosome.

4107
02:48:13,291 --> 02:48:17,870
There's no uterus are saying that on
ironically in 2017 I they're saying it

4108
02:48:18,080 --> 02:48:20,090
on a regular basis.
Really?

4109
02:48:20,150 --> 02:48:21,110
Yup.
Yup.

4110
02:48:21,140 --> 02:48:24,620
It's one of the Jordan Peterson
discussions that he had with some,

4111
02:48:24,680 --> 02:48:27,830
I don't know if it was a man who became
a woman or a woman and became a man,

4112
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:29,240
but she was a professor.

4113
02:48:29,310 --> 02:48:32,780
He's a professor of medicine.
No professor at University of Toronto

4114
02:48:32,781 --> 02:48:35,870
professor in like transgender studies.
I saw the debate.

4115
02:48:35,871 --> 02:48:38,210
Yeah.
It was hilarious.

4116
02:48:38,211 --> 02:48:40,400
Debate.
I know she's saying there's no sexual or

4117
02:48:40,401 --> 02:48:41,330
bile.
What is it?

4118
02:48:41,720 --> 02:48:44,540
There's no difference between the
popular misconception to think that

4119
02:48:44,541 --> 02:48:46,760
there is a difference between a male and
female.

4120
02:48:46,870 --> 02:48:49,180
This doesn't exist and there was no
biological,

4121
02:48:49,220 --> 02:48:51,130
biological basis for Jenny.
Like,

4122
02:48:51,131 --> 02:48:52,980
well,
okay,

4123
02:48:53,310 --> 02:48:57,740
but if you go to the puppy door and you
see,

4124
02:48:57,741 --> 02:49:00,460
oh,
I want a boy puppy and they'll give you

4125
02:49:00,470 --> 02:49:03,210
a girl puppy,
would you say you say,

4126
02:49:03,211 --> 02:49:05,290
well,
there's no biological basis.

4127
02:49:06,050 --> 02:49:08,010
How about the power lifter?
The power lifter that

4128
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:11,850
became a woman and was a competitive
power lifter as a man,

4129
02:49:11,890 --> 02:49:13,500
I just stop you right there because she
is a woman.

4130
02:49:13,501 --> 02:49:14,700
She's always been a woman.
Sorry.

4131
02:49:14,730 --> 02:49:15,780
Don't be a piece of shit.
No,

4132
02:49:15,840 --> 02:49:16,990
she's a woman now.
No,

4133
02:49:16,991 --> 02:49:17,370
no,
no,

4134
02:49:17,370 --> 02:49:18,840
no.
She's always been a woman just now.

4135
02:49:18,841 --> 02:49:20,550
She gets to express herself in the most
unique way.

4136
02:49:20,760 --> 02:49:25,330
I see it when she was,
even though she had an xy chromosome in

4137
02:49:25,331 --> 02:49:27,330
a dick and she was competing in men's
division,

4138
02:49:27,331 --> 02:49:29,550
she was told him she was a woman.
This is so transphobic.

4139
02:49:29,580 --> 02:49:32,040
I can barely handle this.
That's a question,

4140
02:49:32,041 --> 02:49:34,140
man.
She is her authentic self,

4141
02:49:34,430 --> 02:49:38,640
so you get a lot of shit for your,
when you talk this way from I'm only by

4142
02:49:38,641 --> 02:49:40,080
people that are retarded.
Yeah,

4143
02:49:40,170 --> 02:49:43,290
exactly.
I feel like most trans gender people

4144
02:49:43,500 --> 02:49:46,890
would be very reasonable and not be
inside a bunch of transgender people

4145
02:49:46,891 --> 02:49:48,060
come to see me at the Ice House the
other day.

4146
02:49:48,060 --> 02:49:49,440
They'll give me hugs.
They were super sweet.

4147
02:49:49,470 --> 02:49:51,420
I love that.
They said with the Trans community loves

4148
02:49:51,421 --> 02:49:52,590
you.
I love you guys.

4149
02:49:52,650 --> 02:49:54,240
Like there's a lot of trans people,
by the way,

4150
02:49:54,241 --> 02:49:56,520
that we're upset at the whole Bruce
Jenner,

4151
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:58,800
Caitlyn Jenner fiasco.
They were like,

4152
02:49:58,801 --> 02:50:00,150
look,
this is not who we are.

4153
02:50:00,170 --> 02:50:01,980
Like you're,
you just want more attention.

4154
02:50:02,050 --> 02:50:04,290
Hey,
your Kardashians.

4155
02:50:04,320 --> 02:50:06,660
Exactly.
Big Old male cardiac issue became a

4156
02:50:06,661 --> 02:50:07,870
chick settled out.
Right.

4157
02:50:07,890 --> 02:50:09,450
You know,
and there's a lot of people that felt

4158
02:50:09,710 --> 02:50:14,490
sort of like also when they found out
that Bruce Jenner then became Caitlyn

4159
02:50:14,490 --> 02:50:16,560
Jenner,
and then after that didn't believe in

4160
02:50:16,561 --> 02:50:17,394
gay marriage.

4161
02:50:19,800 --> 02:50:24,240
So fucking weird
gave you just crazy.

4162
02:50:24,270 --> 02:50:27,360
You can,
you can be a boy who wants to be a girl

4163
02:50:27,361 --> 02:50:29,610
or a girl wants to be a boy.
Doesn't mean you're smart,

4164
02:50:29,870 --> 02:50:31,650
but doesn't mean you're smart and that's
a problem,

4165
02:50:31,700 --> 02:50:32,491
right?
That's a problem.

4166
02:50:32,491 --> 02:50:35,040
And if you are an intelligent person who
is in the transgender community,

4167
02:50:35,520 --> 02:50:38,310
you don't want that as your ultimate
representation.

4168
02:50:38,670 --> 02:50:40,260
You just don't.
You don't want someone who's got that

4169
02:50:40,261 --> 02:50:42,870
much of a contradiction where they look
and they asked him about it.

4170
02:50:42,871 --> 02:50:44,400
One of the most crazy things he said is
like,

4171
02:50:44,401 --> 02:50:45,160
well,
oh,

4172
02:50:45,160 --> 02:50:46,530
forwards.
It's been the traditional work.

4173
02:50:46,800 --> 02:50:49,770
Like what?
Why not traditionalist?

4174
02:50:49,771 --> 02:50:52,380
You're a man who became a woman that's
not traditional.

4175
02:50:52,560 --> 02:50:55,580
You don't believe in gay marriage
because that's even dumber because

4176
02:50:55,690 --> 02:50:59,460
you're talking about and you're changing
biology and you're saying that some

4177
02:50:59,500 --> 02:51:02,700
manmade bullshit fucking thing called
marriage.

4178
02:51:03,030 --> 02:51:04,920
That guy shouldn't be able to do it if
they love each other.

4179
02:51:04,921 --> 02:51:06,630
But you should be able to be a girl.
Right.

4180
02:51:06,960 --> 02:51:09,420
Shut the fuck up.
That makes me angry.

4181
02:51:09,421 --> 02:51:12,360
So making me angry,
I can't even,

4182
02:51:12,450 --> 02:51:14,160
I ended up rubbing my eyes cause I don't
know how to,

4183
02:51:14,161 --> 02:51:17,670
I don't know how to respond to insanity
is the only time I've ever seen ellen go

4184
02:51:17,671 --> 02:51:18,780
after somebody.
Really?

4185
02:51:18,840 --> 02:51:23,400
Ellen had Caitlyn Jenner on her show and
she actually went after and just notice

4186
02:51:23,401 --> 02:51:25,560
how I said her not mis-gendering cause
I'm a good person.

4187
02:51:25,590 --> 02:51:27,480
Yeah you are.
And I'll vote.

4188
02:51:27,510 --> 02:51:30,150
I'll vote Democrat if it works.
It's strange.

4189
02:51:31,800 --> 02:51:33,900
Remember I stepped out on the podcast.
You were like pull shit.

4190
02:51:34,010 --> 02:51:35,070
I was like,
I've heard it.

4191
02:51:35,370 --> 02:51:38,180
Yeah.
You called it way before anybody knew it

4192
02:51:38,220 --> 02:51:38,940
was called.
I got.

4193
02:51:38,940 --> 02:51:43,940
That's cause I heard it from a reliable
source and you called it like I'm on a

4194
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:45,473
same a year and a half early.
Yes.

4195
02:51:45,620 --> 02:51:46,540
Yes.
Cause I knew it.

4196
02:51:46,550 --> 02:51:49,620
He was already starting to feminize
Feminine Eyes Look,

4197
02:51:49,870 --> 02:51:54,870
looks also it's kids go to a school and
he would show him bracelets and they

4198
02:51:55,081 --> 02:51:56,040
were like,
what's going on?

4199
02:51:57,050 --> 02:52:00,240
It's hair would be in a burette.
You and I need to get press credentials.

4200
02:52:00,420 --> 02:52:04,800
What does this feminism site?
Medusa magazine shuts down after founder

4201
02:52:04,810 --> 02:52:06,550
admits it was pure satire.

4202
02:52:10,630 --> 02:52:13,120
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

4203
02:52:13,121 --> 02:52:16,990
Don't gender your pets.
It was pure satire the whole time.

4204
02:52:17,290 --> 02:52:20,620
Oh you beautiful people.
Thank you on a tweet,

4205
02:52:20,621 --> 02:52:21,790
that podcast.
So

4206
02:52:23,860 --> 02:52:26,560
thank you for being you.
Thank you for fighting the good fight.

4207
02:52:26,710 --> 02:52:28,420
Resist.
That's the real resist.

4208
02:52:28,510 --> 02:52:30,370
Keith Olbermann.
I get what you're doing,

4209
02:52:30,490 --> 02:52:34,780
but the real resist is to fight the
nonsense nonsense with humor.

4210
02:52:34,781 --> 02:52:36,460
We know what Michelangelo said,
my favorite,

4211
02:52:36,461 --> 02:52:38,770
their quote,
criticize by creating,

4212
02:52:38,890 --> 02:52:41,200
I got a new show for you and me.
What you owe me.

4213
02:52:41,300 --> 02:52:43,030
Yeah.
We go to places we get high as fuck.

4214
02:52:43,050 --> 02:52:44,470
Okay.
We become journalists.

4215
02:52:44,680 --> 02:52:46,330
We get high as fuck.
And I don't say anything.

4216
02:52:46,331 --> 02:52:47,060
I forget if,
I don't know,

4217
02:52:47,060 --> 02:52:48,600
we'll be doing just like this.
You just,

4218
02:52:48,700 --> 02:52:49,750
okay,
you don't get high as fuck.

4219
02:52:49,751 --> 02:52:51,100
I get high as fuck.
I can take one hit.

4220
02:52:51,980 --> 02:52:55,210
We go to places as journalists and we
interview people,

4221
02:52:55,270 --> 02:52:59,410
whether it's we go to like a Republican
correspondence dinner or Democratic

4222
02:52:59,560 --> 02:53:03,340
convention or we go and you just,
you and I just,

4223
02:53:03,440 --> 02:53:07,810
but drunk and high and we interviewed
these people and we mocked this whole

4224
02:53:07,811 --> 02:53:07,990
thing.

4225
02:53:07,990 --> 02:53:10,860
We get it.
We get a view of how crazy the frenzy

4226
02:53:10,870 --> 02:53:12,900
is.
The center of the Hive for control of

4227
02:53:12,910 --> 02:53:16,690
the Queen
and watch those fucking crazy assholes

4228
02:53:16,780 --> 02:53:19,420
just to call him.
He called the center of the Hive Freak

4229
02:53:19,421 --> 02:53:22,150
party worldwide.
That's what we call it free party

4230
02:53:22,151 --> 02:53:22,841
worldwide.
We're not,

4231
02:53:22,841 --> 02:53:26,710
Democrats were never publicly
freak party worldwide.

4232
02:53:26,920 --> 02:53:28,020
And we'd go,
Oh man,

4233
02:53:28,150 --> 02:53:30,700
we act as I'm dead serious about this.
I say,

4234
02:53:30,701 --> 02:53:32,530
we get Netflix to do this.
Alright.

4235
02:53:32,620 --> 02:53:34,810
And we just fucking travel.
I'll do it in a heartbeat.

4236
02:53:34,840 --> 02:53:36,670
Yeah.
We get one dude to film must.

4237
02:53:36,671 --> 02:53:40,180
He can keep his mouth shut and we never
see each other.

4238
02:53:40,181 --> 02:53:41,740
I always complain about on the podcast,
I'm like,

4239
02:53:41,741 --> 02:53:43,660
I never see rose.
I sulk about it.

4240
02:53:43,760 --> 02:53:46,510
I'm like,
I see it twice.

4241
02:53:46,570 --> 02:53:47,403
I,
let's go.

4242
02:53:47,500 --> 02:53:49,030
Let's go hunting.
I know,

4243
02:53:49,031 --> 02:53:49,690
but you're,
you're,

4244
02:53:49,690 --> 02:53:52,090
you're deer hunting.
I have a fucking bowl,

4245
02:53:52,091 --> 02:53:52,360
bro.

4246
02:53:52,360 --> 02:53:53,160
I know.
I get a PR.

4247
02:53:53,160 --> 02:53:54,310
I'm out.
I've got a problem though.

4248
02:53:54,311 --> 02:53:56,080
I've got a hunting problem.
What?

4249
02:53:56,110 --> 02:53:56,651
Oh,
really?

4250
02:53:56,651 --> 02:53:59,320
Kimchi and fucking hunting.
You mean you were an extreme of both?

4251
02:53:59,350 --> 02:54:00,730
Yep.
I'd never seen that before from,

4252
02:54:00,731 --> 02:54:01,391
you know,
well,

4253
02:54:01,391 --> 02:54:02,340
this is,
you know,

4254
02:54:02,470 --> 02:54:04,710
I'm out there every day shooting out of
rubber dear.

4255
02:54:04,730 --> 02:54:05,563
Are you?
Yeah.

4256
02:54:06,290 --> 02:54:09,760
It's a real problem.
I kept fucking,

4257
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:14,860
I got gold
in my arm to pull my bow back.

4258
02:54:14,861 --> 02:54:16,800
Too much ad against stem cell shots.
Oh yeah,

4259
02:54:16,801 --> 02:54:17,380
yeah,
yeah.

4260
02:54:17,380 --> 02:54:18,520
I'm going crazy.
Yeah.

4261
02:54:18,650 --> 02:54:20,500
I have a good time though.
Fucking wonderful time.

4262
02:54:21,690 --> 02:54:24,400
He fucking boxing shop gets mad at me
for sparring,

4263
02:54:24,401 --> 02:54:27,010
but I just love it so much that it rod
bitch that it,

4264
02:54:27,011 --> 02:54:27,844
right.
I'm with you,

4265
02:54:27,970 --> 02:54:29,080
but it rod.
Yeah.

4266
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:31,420
Did you see that?
That where Luke rockhold punched me in

4267
02:54:31,421 --> 02:54:32,470
the fucking nose.
Yeah.

4268
02:54:32,471 --> 02:54:33,190
Don't want to do that.

4269
02:54:33,190 --> 02:54:36,610
And then,
and then I had to go get makeup to my

4270
02:54:36,611 --> 02:54:38,140
nose was so black and blue.
I had to go.

4271
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:42,030
I'm at the fucking San Jose Improv.
That's how I kind of take pictures of,

4272
02:54:42,050 --> 02:54:44,200
this is ridiculous.
I couldn't cover it.

4273
02:54:44,380 --> 02:54:46,450
It was black and blue.
Why'd you let him punch you?

4274
02:54:46,480 --> 02:54:47,410
I didn't.
I didn't.

4275
02:54:47,411 --> 02:54:48,191
It wasn't like,
hey look.

4276
02:54:48,191 --> 02:54:50,080
I was like,
well obviously he threw me headgear and

4277
02:54:50,081 --> 02:54:50,381
I go,
hey,

4278
02:54:50,381 --> 02:54:51,250
look,
listen to me right now.

4279
02:54:51,251 --> 02:54:53,200
I'm a gazelle right now.
And they're a bunch of lines out there.

4280
02:54:53,350 --> 02:54:56,890
Let those people know like all those
guys training that I'm,

4281
02:54:56,980 --> 02:55:01,980
I'm a bitch that I'm an actor 50 and I
dance around a gym.

4282
02:55:02,441 --> 02:55:05,270
How bad did it hit?
I spar because I do it with people who

4283
02:55:05,271 --> 02:55:06,750
aren't athletic.
Yeah,

4284
02:55:06,890 --> 02:55:09,050
but it was way worse than that.
What's that?

4285
02:55:09,170 --> 02:55:10,003
What did he hit you with?

4286
02:55:10,220 --> 02:55:12,110
Oh,
he punched me with his fucking glove

4287
02:55:12,111 --> 02:55:13,520
right in the nose.
That's when it was.

4288
02:55:13,610 --> 02:55:15,260
It wasn't even,
it got purple.

4289
02:55:15,350 --> 02:55:15,831
Okay.
Well,

4290
02:55:15,831 --> 02:55:17,930
why do you think it's cute to fight
professionals?

4291
02:55:18,170 --> 02:55:19,010
Domo,
first of all,

4292
02:55:19,011 --> 02:55:21,170
I didn't want to,
I thought it was going to hit mitts and

4293
02:55:21,171 --> 02:55:23,390
he throws me headgear and I go,
I don't want to do this.

4294
02:55:23,480 --> 02:55:27,170
And Daniel Cormier goes,
I got him first and core mate double

4295
02:55:27,171 --> 02:55:28,790
legs me and look at it,
look at that.

4296
02:55:28,791 --> 02:55:32,840
Stupid knows are going to take pictures
with ridiculous what didn't work.

4297
02:55:32,900 --> 02:55:35,420
You should just stick to just straight
boxing where you could school them with

4298
02:55:35,421 --> 02:55:36,680
your skills.
Oh yeah.

4299
02:55:36,681 --> 02:55:39,900
You know me.
I'll fucking slip those jazz pop,

4300
02:55:39,901 --> 02:55:40,880
pop,
pop about.

4301
02:55:40,920 --> 02:55:42,890
That's the one of the worst things.
Like why don't you get involved in

4302
02:55:42,891 --> 02:55:44,510
Jujitsu that way you don't have to get
hit.

4303
02:55:44,570 --> 02:55:45,170
I'm going to.

4304
02:55:45,170 --> 02:55:46,520
Yeah,
because this wrestling I miss.

4305
02:55:46,521 --> 02:55:47,990
I Miss Mat work.
I really do.

4306
02:55:48,120 --> 02:55:52,140
When you first started doing Jiu Jitsu,
way back when we were at Carlson

4307
02:55:52,140 --> 02:55:54,230
Gracie's malaise.
You took to it right away because I was

4308
02:55:54,231 --> 02:55:55,610
a wrestler and it was like,
oh,

4309
02:55:55,611 --> 02:55:57,590
this is,
I got trained with hence over here for a

4310
02:55:57,590 --> 02:55:58,440
year.
I love Jujitsu.

4311
02:55:58,460 --> 02:55:59,293
I love it.
Love it.

4312
02:55:59,570 --> 02:56:02,120
I like boxing though.
I really like.

4313
02:56:02,180 --> 02:56:04,520
It's fun.
It's such a challenge to me like,

4314
02:56:04,550 --> 02:56:05,211
like,
like,

4315
02:56:05,211 --> 02:56:07,820
um,
obviously Jujitsu is a whole world and

4316
02:56:07,821 --> 02:56:09,830
it's really difficult,
but there's something about boxing at my

4317
02:56:09,831 --> 02:56:13,790
age I guess I like because it's,
it's,

4318
02:56:13,791 --> 02:56:16,130
I guess it's just such a mystery.
It's such a mystery tenant.

4319
02:56:16,160 --> 02:56:18,390
Well,
you're learning a skill and pattern in

4320
02:56:18,420 --> 02:56:19,020
the,
yeah.

4321
02:56:19,020 --> 02:56:20,960
And then on top of that you're also
working out.

4322
02:56:21,050 --> 02:56:22,370
Yes.
That's one of the fun thing.

4323
02:56:22,371 --> 02:56:24,680
Like you've used to find a sport,
like here's a good one.

4324
02:56:24,680 --> 02:56:26,570
Soccer,
I'll give you play soccer.

4325
02:56:26,571 --> 02:56:28,760
You're going to fucking run around a
lot,

4326
02:56:28,790 --> 02:56:30,350
a lot.
But you're also going to fuck your knees

4327
02:56:30,351 --> 02:56:31,670
up you to fucking,
and I'm tool.

4328
02:56:31,780 --> 02:56:33,860
But boxing,
you actually stay pretty injury free,

4329
02:56:33,861 --> 02:56:35,570
believe it or not.
And you can get to the point where

4330
02:56:35,571 --> 02:56:36,231
you're not going to,
yeah,

4331
02:56:36,231 --> 02:56:39,020
but you wear headgear,
you don't go crazy on each other.

4332
02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:41,000
I'm not fucking fighting,
you know?

4333
02:56:41,001 --> 02:56:44,540
Do you know where you get hurt when you
spar dudes who don't box and they swim

4334
02:56:44,541 --> 02:56:46,940
for the fences and they catch you and
you fight.

4335
02:56:46,941 --> 02:56:50,710
Dudes like that are really good.
[inaudible] the Great Wayne Mcculloch

4336
02:56:50,711 --> 02:56:52,880
out spar with him.
Sometimes I get in there,

4337
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:57,080
Wayne's fucking Wayne.
Wayne at 44 is going to do whatever he

4338
02:56:57,081 --> 02:57:00,050
wants even though he's 135 pounds,
but it's,

4339
02:57:00,110 --> 02:57:01,580
we're moving around.
He'll hit me,

4340
02:57:01,581 --> 02:57:02,870
but it's not,
he's not going crazy.

4341
02:57:02,880 --> 02:57:03,440
Exactly.

4342
02:57:03,440 --> 02:57:03,950
Yeah,
exactly.

4343
02:57:03,950 --> 02:57:06,200
That's,
that's the best in Jujitsu to you get

4344
02:57:06,201 --> 02:57:08,000
less hurt when you spar with someone
who's really good.

4345
02:57:08,001 --> 02:57:09,110
Correct.
You don't win.

4346
02:57:09,500 --> 02:57:11,690
You're going to get tapped a lot,
but you won't get hurt.

4347
02:57:11,770 --> 02:57:13,310
Right.
He'll just control you and you learn

4348
02:57:13,311 --> 02:57:16,010
patterns and then pretty soon you learn
these patterns,

4349
02:57:16,011 --> 02:57:18,740
you start practicing.
Then you go against the guy who doesn't

4350
02:57:18,741 --> 02:57:21,950
box a lot and you look good.
Like you know what you're doing.

4351
02:57:21,980 --> 02:57:22,581
Yeah.
And he goes,

4352
02:57:22,581 --> 02:57:24,260
dude,
you've been doing it a long time ago.

4353
02:57:25,900 --> 02:57:29,390
A opprobrium I look good.
Just see my left.

4354
02:57:29,450 --> 02:57:31,700
What's funny is you can find,
somebody can learn how to hit myths.

4355
02:57:31,730 --> 02:57:34,100
It's where you punching from and we'll
kind of like,

4356
02:57:34,101 --> 02:57:36,560
how are you setting that up?
That's how are you not getting hit.

4357
02:57:36,590 --> 02:57:37,730
Yeah.
And what happens when you hit to the

4358
02:57:37,731 --> 02:57:42,731
body and like
that's the worst.

4359
02:57:44,480 --> 02:57:47,310
That is the fucking worst.
That's why it kickboxing.

4360
02:57:47,311 --> 02:57:48,970
He's so much more terrifying.
And Molly,

4361
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:50,990
ty wants to,
is getting need in the body.

4362
02:57:52,110 --> 02:57:57,110
And I was watching John Wayne Parts.
He had a video up on his instagram of

4363
02:57:57,141 --> 02:58:00,620
him fighting when he was 17.
The first title that he won.

4364
02:58:00,940 --> 02:58:03,360
Wayne parts like 44 note John Wayne
Carson,

4365
02:58:03,370 --> 02:58:04,510
my boyfriend,
and talking about 40,

4366
02:58:05,220 --> 02:58:07,170
41.
And he's 41.

4367
02:58:07,710 --> 02:58:09,270
And uh,
still going after it,

4368
02:58:09,480 --> 02:58:13,320
but like watching a video of him from
when he was 17 years old knee and some

4369
02:58:13,321 --> 02:58:15,270
dude in the body body's like,
oh,

4370
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:16,770
oh,
punches.

4371
02:58:17,880 --> 02:58:20,370
I don't have time to condition my shin.
This is him.

4372
02:58:20,760 --> 02:58:23,730
17 men net crazy.
1993.

4373
02:58:24,210 --> 02:58:27,810
[inaudible] crazy.
Look at those needs of the body son.

4374
02:58:29,520 --> 02:58:32,110
Is that him and the Red John Wayne
Parts.

4375
02:58:32,140 --> 02:58:33,750
Fucking savage.
Boom,

4376
02:58:33,780 --> 02:58:35,550
boom,
boom is a real fighter man.

4377
02:58:35,610 --> 02:58:36,443
Yeah.
It's um,

4378
02:58:36,600 --> 02:58:38,940
it's a crazy way to express yourself,
you know,

4379
02:58:38,941 --> 02:58:41,280
but you really get to see a person's
character in a fight.

4380
02:58:42,360 --> 02:58:45,210
That's the thing that makes it so crazy.
It's just,

4381
02:58:45,270 --> 02:58:50,270
it's this wild may lay of bones and
flesh and you get to see how bright your

4382
02:58:52,051 --> 02:58:54,630
star shines.
It's also really awesome to learn

4383
02:58:54,631 --> 02:58:56,220
defense and learn how to get out of the
way.

4384
02:58:56,230 --> 02:58:58,890
Learn how to block your eyes open when
somebody kicking and stuff.

4385
02:58:58,920 --> 02:59:00,420
Yeah,
problem solving.

4386
02:59:00,690 --> 02:59:02,580
How to figure out what to do when.
Yeah.

4387
02:59:02,790 --> 02:59:06,000
When the issues are what poon that's it
by the way.

4388
02:59:06,150 --> 02:59:08,100
I shouldn't,
but just so everybody knows I didn't

4389
02:59:08,101 --> 02:59:11,070
spar with Luke.
Rockhold games just punched you in the

4390
02:59:11,071 --> 02:59:13,230
face.
I got to move around and they were

4391
02:59:13,231 --> 02:59:14,910
really nice to me and they,
they,

4392
02:59:15,060 --> 02:59:18,240
they move me around at will so let's
not,

4393
02:59:18,270 --> 02:59:21,320
I hate when people like me say,
I sparred with so and said,

4394
02:59:21,360 --> 02:59:23,490
no you didn't spar.
You didn't spar with them cause they'd

4395
02:59:23,491 --> 02:59:24,160
beat the fuck that.

4396
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:25,050
Fuck him.
Yes.

4397
02:59:25,080 --> 02:59:27,900
You moved around with them and they were
being cool and you've got to throw some

4398
02:59:27,901 --> 02:59:30,660
shit and do some stuff that you've
learned and giggles.

4399
02:59:31,100 --> 02:59:32,160
Yeah.
Relax.

4400
02:59:32,220 --> 02:59:34,980
Yeah.
If I'd opened up with my taekwondo,

4401
02:59:35,490 --> 02:59:37,320
they'd be sued.
What if you did like with him?

4402
02:59:37,321 --> 02:59:40,920
Bruce Lee movies did my wheel kick.
You want to know fucking shit.

4403
02:59:41,180 --> 02:59:43,950
I've seen it like sorta like when that
not in the air.

4404
02:59:43,951 --> 02:59:47,760
You have caution and Regan air.
You know ty cobb could read the letters

4405
02:59:47,761 --> 02:59:50,430
on the,
I can see your kick coming a mile away,

4406
02:59:50,440 --> 02:59:51,770
but you can read.
You can read.

4407
02:59:52,290 --> 02:59:54,510
You can read the label on my underwear.

4408
02:59:56,670 --> 02:59:57,570
Well,
Brian Callan,

up,

4410
02:59:59,810 --> 03:00:02,280

We need to do this more often.

4411
03:00:02,281 --> 03:00:03,900
I love we've said this before.
I miss you too.

4412
03:00:04,080 --> 03:00:05,280
I never see it.
I don't see you enough.

4413
03:00:05,281 --> 03:00:07,080
It hurts my feelings.
My feelings are a little hurt.

4414
03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:08,430

My knee not hurt too.

4417

All right,
