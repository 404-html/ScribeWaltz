00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
this episode of the podcast is brought 

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,211
to you by squarespace.
Squarespace is the official number one 

3
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:15,240
only web space,
creating sponsor the best one.

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,230
The best.
I mean,

5
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:19,110
there's no need to use anything else.
If you want to create your own website,

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,150
if you need a website,
you should do it yourself.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,210
It's that the technology has reached a 
point where I would suggest to people 

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:26,260
that need a new website.
Well,

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,840
are you specific?
Do you know what you want?

10
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:29,310
Yet,
when then you could do it yourself.

11
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,950
You could literally do it yourself.
A professional looking website.

12
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,050
With squarespace,
squarespace,

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,160
it's the best deal.
I'm actually using them for my sign up 

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:39,390
twice.
I'm using it for a second website that I

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,750
just started last week and it's amazing.

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,150
I know so many people use it.
Kara,

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,170
Santa Maria.
Use it to manage her webspace.

18
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,110
I'm Duncan uses it.
It's amazing.

19
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:48,740
Yeah,
it was funny.

20
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:50,510
The guys at squarespace when I met him 
in New York,

21
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:51,320
they're like,
we got a,

22
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,530
a,
one of those report tickets when things 

23
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:56,530
are going wrong.
What's that called?

24
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:56,530
Uh,
yeah.

25
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,410
What's it called?
A ticket

26
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,900
report,
ticket support,

27
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,860
support,
not report.

28
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:05,861
Yeah,
they got a support ticket for Duncan 

29
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:05,990
trussell and they were like,
is this Duncan trussell Duncan trussell.

30
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,830
We're trying to figure it out.
Squarespace is seriously.

31
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:14,831
It's one of the easiest things you'll 
ever do when it comes to creating 

32
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:14,831
something that looks incredibly 
professional.

33
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:19,510
You can create a unique website for 
yourself or your business with a simple 

34
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,840
drag and drop interface.
They offer 24 slash seven support and it

35
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:25,841
works on everything.
It'll work on your iphone or to work on 

36
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:28,901
your android phone or to work on a UNIX 
computer or work on a Mac to work on 

37
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:32,000
windows and every site comes with a 
unique online version of it.

38
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:37,330
The mobile version,
rather everything's online with my 

39
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,650
daughter,
mom mobile unique mobile version that 

40
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,361
matches the overall style of your 
website so that your content will look 

41
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:43,361
great on every device.

42
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:45,440
Every time.
Squarespace also has a logo creator.

43
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:50,441
We can create a clean,
simple logo d designed for yourself in 

44
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:53,120
minutes and every single website you do 
on squarespace,

45
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:57,440
you can start an online store with it.
Every site comes with an online store.

46
00:01:57,441 --> 00:02:02,441
It's super easy to do.
If you can just attach photos to email 

47
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:04,460
and get around a computer like a normal 
person,

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,820
you can make your own website.
It's the technology has reached that 

49
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,480

A better web starts with your website.

52
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,890
We're also brought to you by legal zoom.
Legal Zoom is an awesome way that you 

53
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,400
can handle a lot of legal issues without
leaving your house.

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,480
It used to be that you would have to go 
to a lawyer and make an appointment and 

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,860
pay a lot of money to resolve.
Simple things like power of attorney,

56
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:38,930
living trusts,
wills,

57
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,500
you can do all that stuff online.
Now through legal zoom.

58
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,600
They've been handling it for over 10 
years.

59
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,780
They have an a plus with the better 
business bureau and they've helped 

60
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,020
protect people's assets with Llcs,
s corporations,

61
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:52,910
trademarks,
real estate documents,

62
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:55,310
and more.
Even allegedly.

63
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,290
I mean I've seen it on the website 
offered divorce,

64
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,530
but I would like to look at.
I would like to look at how many people 

65
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:02,530
have

66
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:02,530
actually got divorced through legal 
zoom.

67
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,370
A grueling 10 years with legal.
Yeah.

68
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,730
People to it out,
man.

69
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,030
I was listening to this interview with 
this guy was talking about how much 

70
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,111
money you had to pay.
Some famous guy was telling you mention 

71
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:16,111
his name,
but he's talking about how much money,

72
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:17,680
how to pay out in a divorce and freaking
out about it.

73
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:22,681
That's war with some people.
More old stories to say about how your 

74
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:25,990
friend had to pay for his own wife's.
I'm going through it.

75
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,830
I wonder if I could use legal zoom.
Got divorced.

76
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,260
What's his name?
Gary.

77
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,850
Let us get married.
Why would they let us get married and 

78
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,670
begin with skin fight?
We can't be married each other.

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,400
Anyway,
go to legalzoom.com.

80
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:47,401
Dad,
why are you marrying him and see if you 

81
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,120
can get divorced from your boyfriend or 
your husband?

82
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,290
Whatever.
My Dad,

83
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,510
whenever a gay dude says my husband,
I was just go.

84
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,840
Okay.
I got it.

85
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:55,900
It takes a second.
You know what I'm saying?

86
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,110
I'm not judging,
but you said husband,

87
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:00,070
right?
Your guy.

88
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,850
All right.
Oh,

89
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:01,550
okay.
All right,

90
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,570
well don't you believe it's possible.
I'm not homophobic at all,

91
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:07,390
but if I see and I live in New York 
where if you see two guys making out,

92
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:11,870
you're still like weird word a little 
still.

93
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Well it's always going to be if you're a
heterosexual because for the most part 

94
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,461
you don't see it until you reach an 
adult age and then you're out in the 

95
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,520
wild with the wild homosexuals that just
frequent these uh,

96
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,010
thoroughfares and there's avenues and 
spot.

97
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,460
Like if you go down Santa Monica 
Boulevard and probably we should 

98
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:31,460
probably just start the podcast right 
here.

99
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,270
Is there different levels of that where 
you look at c,

100
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:34,750
two people kissing and you're just like,
you know what,

101
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,070
I'm a little hungry for that.

102
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,540
Or like,
oh my God,

103
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,910
that's hot.
Is it at all?

104
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,940
Like on and off,
you think like some people look go to 

105
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:44,940
who?
What are you saying?

106
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,620
Like if you're walking down the street 
and see anybody walking on the street,

107
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,160
two guys kissing each other I ever say,
is that,

108
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,530
is it completely hilarious and weird?
Or is it like mildly?

109
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:56,920
Like,
oh,

110
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,060
I see what they're doing there,
or is it like,

111
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,750
because that seems to be talking to this
question now way,

112
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:05,160
way before you tried to express yourself
in such a complex manner.

113
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,880
It seems very like I wonder if there's 
different levels because I'm,

114
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:08,890
I'm,
I'm like,

115
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:13,891
that's hilarious and creepy and weird.
It depends on what the guys look like 

116
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:18,420
because there's a broad spectrum of 
masculine to feminine homosexuals just 

117
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:18,850
like there are,
you know,

118
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,040
like women look different,
you know?

119
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:26,041
I mean if,
if you run into to have a certain type 

120
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:26,080
of women making out,
it's not fun,

121
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,470
but if know it's uncomfortable,
but if you run into women that are just 

122
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,130
whatever,
for whatever reason they flow together 

123
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,171
well visually,
but if to Brad Pitt's we're kissing or 

124
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,310
Brad Pitt and George Clooney never be 
hot to me because I'm a straight male,

125
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,510
what I would sympathize,
I would say,

126
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:48,511
you know what's weird that I would judge
and then I would hope that they don't 

127
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:48,511
run into anybody.

128
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:49,900
That's mean I do that.
Would you take a photo?

129
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,790
No,
that's rude to have you stolen.

130
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,170
Just make like against a telephone pole.
Depends if someone,

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,040
they started taking

132
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,690
their pants off,
I'd probably start filming,

133
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,660
started going after it,
but then you get caught with gay porn on

134
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:05,390
your phone and then illegally acquired 
gay porn.

135
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,810
You're a bad person and you're.
Yeah,

136
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,260
you're not supposed to be just fill in 
people.

137
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,570
I don't think you're supposed to just 
film people,

138
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,990
you know.
I don't know what the rules are like 

139
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,830
about.
I guess if you do something publicly 

140
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,830
should be assumed that you're filming 
it,

141
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,060
but if you just took film of some guys,
make it out and put it on Youtube.

142
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,370
If you make a website called Joe News,
you could just say you just hang one of 

143
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,540
those signs around your neck,
like when they do for TV shows,

144
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:30,490
like filming in progress to assume that 
you will be shown.

145
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,660
Yeah.
Legalzoom.com.

146
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:36,050
That gives a codeword Rogan.
He goes out with all these questions.

147
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:37,640
I don't think they can do.

148
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,730
You can hire an attorney.
Legal Zoom was developed by top 

149
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,940
attorneys to provide self help services 
at your specific direction,

150
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,970
but they're not a law firm.
Um,

151
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,160
they will provide you with a third party
attorney though if the shit hits the 

152
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,341
fan.
I have to say all this before we get 

153
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:55,811
done with this.
Otherwise we'll be stuck in this 

154
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:55,811
commercial for an hour.
Anyway,

155
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:57,170
we've,
we've used legal zoom.

156
00:06:57,171 --> 00:07:02,171
Brian used it to a form desk squads.
Aubrey used it to make on it.

157
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,550
It's a,
it's an awesome service.

158
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,460
So you go to legalzoom.com
and use the codeword Rogan.

159
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:12,461
And last but not least,
we're brought to you by [inaudible] dot 

160
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:14,711
com.
That is o n n I t a human optimization 

161
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:17,951
website.
And on it is right now releasing the 

162
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:19,760
newest of our artistic kettlebells,
Werewolf Kettlebell,

163
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,140
the legend bells.
We have the Zombie Bells of course,

164
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:25,490
which I think we're out of.

165
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,590
I think that's what's going on.
The website here,

166
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,290
I'm sure there's armed rebels were out 
of them.

167
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,160
Still have the great apes.
We still have some of those and we will.

168
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,740
I'm sure we'll have the Zombie bills 
back because they were fucking awesome.

169
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,630
We've got some other ones that are 
coming out too.

170
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,710
We've got some new ones.
Oh,

171
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:40,670
that's nice,
man.

172
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,930
Yeah,
the wearables dope,

173
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,780
it's heavy as fuck to the Werewolf is a 
big one.

174
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,720
It's 65 pounds,
28 kilograms,

175
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:52,721
60 to 62 pounds,
so it's a good one to work out with 

176
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:56,920
hurt.
They hurt if you do any kind of like a 

177
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,380
foot to flip it over and your risks.
Like I used to do one with a skull and 

178
00:07:59,380 --> 00:07:59,380
yeah,
we just cracked my wrist.

179
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,980
Well you got to do is first of all,
you got to make sure that the face is 

180
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,340
outside facing the opposite direction.

181
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,070
That's a simple solution.
I guess that's what you do,

182
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:12,071
but that's hard to do when you're tired.
But the other thing is you got to learn 

183
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:14,840
the technique of like punching through.
Like when do you swing a kettle bell?

184
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:19,841
There's a certain amount of control that
you develop with it where it doesn't 

185
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:22,631
ever hurt your arm because then like a 
lot of times people when they're 

186
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:26,051
starting out especially they'll put like
risk things on like they're trying to 

187
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:29,440
get an eagle to land on their arms 
cushion things so that when the 

188
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,380
Kettlebell flips and hits it,
it doesn't hurt.

189
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,720
But you get,
you get to know what,

190
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,870
what's moving.
You're supposed to like twist it sorta 

191
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,970
twisted towards you first and then as 
you're going up you sort of punched 

192
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,130
through it and then it's a.
If you do it in a smooth motion,

193
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:44,570
never really slams in your arm.

194
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,310
But the thing is if you're doing them 
right,

195
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,440
you're going to get tired.
When you get tired,

196
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:50,360
that's when your techniques suffers.
That's when you can.

197
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,530
You could fuck yourself up.
Oh,

198
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,580
techniques.
Suffering is.

199
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,850
I've done some doing crossfit.
I did so much damage because I just 

200
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,320
never.
We've worked hard on good form.

201
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,460
It's so important.
Yeah.

202
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:04,461
Welcome to the club.
There's so many people that have hurt 

203
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,550
themselves doing that kind of stuff.
Those a power lifting exercises,

204
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,040
you know,
especially I'm Steve,

205
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:12,900
I'm a maxwell who's a real expert in 
fitness and the guy who's,

206
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,180
he's in incredible shape,
he's 62 years old.

207
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,970
You guys are just an animal and just a 
wealth of knowledge.

208
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,810
He's not a fan of those type of workouts
because he said that those power lifting

209
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:26,811
workouts should all be done with very 
strict form and very heavy weights and 

210
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:28,560
very low reps and he's like,
so they're essentially taking these,

211
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,740
these workouts that are all about this 
one big explosion and the most you can 

212
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,260
get up and they're doing them over and 
over and over and over and over and over

213
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,010
and some people can get away with that,
but some people get really fucked up.

214
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Well,
they also have the element of like 

215
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,040
competition to it,
which I never really bought into because

216
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,250
I was just doing it like trying a lot of
weight and get in shape.

217
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,940
So I just.
I looked at it as like whatever was on 

218
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,501
that board was my workout,
but there was a competition element so 

219
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:55,590
it is funny that they spend.
But the first 15 minutes of any crossfit

220
00:09:55,591 --> 00:10:00,591
class I've done is showing you the form 
of today's workout is the proper dead 

221
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:03,330
lift.
This is a proper clean power clean,

222
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,150
and then they do that for 15 minutes.
Then they go,

223
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,930
all right as fast as you can now for 
seven minutes,

224
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:10,050
and it's like crazy,
you know,

225
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,900
and these people are competitive people 
and they want to win,

226
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:17,901
so gosh,
just like you just see how they're bent 

227
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:20,541
over the wrong way and just like putting
so much on your back for anybody that's 

228
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:25,251
thinking about doing any kind of workout
with either kettlebells or even just 

229
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:25,920
regular weights,
just dumbbells or barbells,

230
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,600
please start off slow.

231
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,470
If you've never done any workout before,
working out is all about.

232
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:35,010
It's tearing down your muscle fiber and 
then heels and when it heals,

233
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:40,011
it gets stronger.
You have to tear it down and then you 

234
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:42,861
have to recover.
The recovery is one of the most 

235
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:43,020
important parts and that's one of the 
things that fucks up a lot of athletes.

236
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,360
It's one of the number one issues when 
it comes to wrestlers,

237
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,520
like a lot of wrestlers because there's 
so mentally tough.

238
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:52,521
They overtrain they fuck their whole 
body up because your body's never 

239
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:52,521
getting the proper rest.
You don't.

240
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:55,410
If you're not a competitive athlete,
that's in some sort of a program.

241
00:10:55,411 --> 00:11:00,411
We can't.
You can't decide how much workout you 

242
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:00,411
you have to do because you have to 
follow a team.

243
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:04,670
If you're not in that kind of an 
athletic program and you can do it 

244
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:04,800
yourself,
be fucking smart about it.

245
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
It's hard to do because everybody wants 
to just.

246
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,310
God Damn it,
I've been a fat ass.

247
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:10,260
I've been eating donuts and drinking 
cokes.

248
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,560
I need it just I'm going to clean up my 
diet and I'm gonna work out like an 

249
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:15,560
animal.
If you do it too hard,

250
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,260
too quick,
you rip things apart,

251
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,070
you will.
You're.

252
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:20,670
Your body's not developed for it.
You've got to build up to those kinds of

253
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,040
workouts.
That's why.

254
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:27,260
That's why like steroids.
That's what they do is they help you 

255
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,260
heal fast.
He could work out harder.

256
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,260
I think it's such a funny misconception 
always,

257
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:31,950
but steroids were even in movies that 
would make it like,

258
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:36,951
you know,
it's like they stick steroids and 

259
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:36,951
druggos arm and he could just win 
fights.

260
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:40,680
You know what I mean?
People always treated with Barry bonds 

261
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:40,680
like that.
They were like,

262
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,251
he takes steroids,
like he injected into his arm so we can 

263
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:44,640
crack home runs they go,
still requires a ton of extra workout.

264
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,950
It was gonna work harder still than 
anybody else.

265
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:51,951
Definitely,
but you definitely have an advantage 

266
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:51,951
over everybody else who works on it 
without an argument.

267
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,980
I mean none of these guys are taking it 
and then

268
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,980
just being world leaders are taken and 
working out like demons and then being 

269
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:58,980
world beers.
Yeah,

270
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,940
there's a lot a lot going on with that 
stuff,

271
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,340
but the real problem with it is the 
crashes,

272
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:05,300
their endocrine systems fucks up their 
body.

273
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,900
I was watching this,
this thing on bodybuilders,

274
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:11,620
men's videos watch this online where 
this guy was interviewing a bodybuilder.

275
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,750
I responded to them.
It's my timeline yesterday.

276
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,020
It's the craziest shit ever.
Has Dude who was a big time competitive 

277
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,531
bodybuilder,
talked about how he got into it and 

278
00:12:22,531 --> 00:12:22,531
talked about all the stuff that he was 
dumping into his body and it's like,

279
00:12:22,531 --> 00:12:25,630
whoa,
fucking pain pills every day.

280
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:28,570
Vikatin steroids this,
that is his kid.

281
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,450
He's like 30.
His kidney was like ready to go.

282
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,500
Like they were like,
dude,

283
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,300
you're going to be on dialysis in a 
year.

284
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Like it's over.
Like you're going to have to need new 

285
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,360
kidneys.

286
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,580
Like you're usually just crashing the 
whole party.

287
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,190
Just take giant purple,
fucking great monster.

288
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:48,191
What needle marks and fucking feigns 
everywhere and they just get addicted.

289
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,020
Get addicted to that thing of sticking 
chemicals in your body and make your 

290
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,860
body bigger and training like a monster.
You'd call them a junkie too if it was 

291
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,610
like if you saw what they did,
they have like,

292
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,850
you know,
a plate or we.

293
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:05,851
I grew up with,
my stepfather was a competitive power 

294
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:05,851
lifter,
so he was a new.

295
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:06,460
A lot of friends who were bodybuilders 
and stuff.

296
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:09,280
And you see these guys have like a plate
of pills in front of him everyday.

297
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,200
Oh my God.
Wow.

298
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,360
That's so crazy.
Chunky behavior.

299
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,400
Not Yeah,
that's not a healthy folks,

300
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,700
but yeah,
junkie behavior exists in a lot of 

301
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:20,700
forms.
Existing gambling.

302
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,110
Gambling is the big one.
I'm around so many people.

303
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,080
I know so many people that have really 
crazy gambling problems.

304
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,510
That video they just put up,
keeps going to be on the podcast.

305
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,380
We're working it out right now.
It looks like he'll be on October 10th.

306
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,470
Really looking forward to having him on 
and talk to him that the video is the 

307
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,641
best workout video I've ever had.
The extreme kettlebell cardio workout 

308
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:42,130
series.
They're so brutal.

309
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:44,320
It's all you need folks.
You don't need a gym membership.

310
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,860
DVD cost 30 bucks.
You take one Kettlebell,

311
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,490
a 35 pound Kettlebell in.
It will fuck you up.

312
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,020
I mean literally you don't need any more
equipment and that Kettlebell will be 

313
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,730
around to the end of time.
It's solid metal.

314
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,980
Those things,
they're so fucking durable.

315
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:01,480
You never have to worry about them 
breaking.

316
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,640
I mean you buy one,
you have that for life.

317
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:06,160
You can pass those things including the 
artistic ones,

318
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,810
the Werewolf and the chimpanzee.

319
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,810
Those are solid cast steel.
I mean those are iron kettle bells.

320
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,920
These are like the old Russian metal.
I guess it's.

321
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,140
I guess it's.
I guess it's iron,

322
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,930
but the Russians were the ones who 
develop these things.

323
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,340
This,
this design.

324
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,330
I mean,
there's some of them,

325
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:24,520
they make some of them that are like 
aluminum on the outside of their,

326
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:26,590
kind of waited on the inside.
These are not those,

327
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:29,320
these are solid,
solid metal and they're awesome.

328
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,330
You can't get like any better quality 
kettlebells.

329
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,530
We found the best ones you can get 
online and they're a little more awkward

330
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,560
in some ways to lift with then some of 
the what they call competition 

331
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,400
kettlebells that are larger kettlebells 
but lighter.

332
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,800
But that awkwardness I think is good.
You know,

333
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,910
everybody's trying to do fucking 
comfortable with these God damn things 

334
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,010
they're difficult to use and I do.
That's how I do

335
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:57,010
my squats.
Now I've put a 70 in each hand and do 

336
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:57,010
those things.
It's awesome.

337
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,960
Go all the way down to your ass,
touches your calves and just think 

338
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,021
you're fucking fighting for your life.
Think that Werewolf's are chasing you 

339
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:05,430
and shit.
Are you holding onto it?

340
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:11,140
I do.
I think they're like my life's in 

341
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,140
danger.
I think I'm like,

342
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,261
I'm on a hunting trip,
but I'm trying to get up a tree and a 

343
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:14,261
bear's chasing me or something like 
that.

344
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:15,030
Were Werewolf ones like or like right 
here going.

345
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,730
It's probably so we're referred to that 
kind of trading.

346
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:23,420
It's like a like apocalypse trading 
because all functional movement.

347
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,800
Yeah.
What could you do?

348
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:30,050
Functional movement is like,
it's huge doing pull ups and stuff like 

349
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,061
that.
Even just those basic movements like 

350
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:34,061
it's amazing how I can't do a pull up 
still.

351
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:37,391
Like if I was,
if I remember always feeling that 

352
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:37,391
feeling.

353
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:37,391
If you were like falling from a building
movies,

354
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,790
they'll catch themselves in the legend 
there.

355
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,610
Like going to delay me dying for a 
couple more seconds.

356
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:46,250
Like I could not possibly pull my bot.
Maybe.

357
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,860
Maybe with an adrenaline shot I shoot 
up,

358
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:52,190
but something tells me if I had to pull 
my own body weight up a building,

359
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:54,320
I'd be gone.
If you got to catch yourself by hand,

360
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,770
you'd have to be like one of those park 
core dudes shirt,

361
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,840
super gymnast dudes.
Most of us would just spazz off the 

362
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,290
building and fucking crashed to our 
death and we're gonna be at coke nails.

363
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,350
They would promise Werewolf evoke nails.
Have you ever seen those Russian guys 

364
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:13,140
who go out on like the cranes?
I can't watch that much.

365
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,020
It makes my legs feel weird.
A on a.com

366
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,050
o n and N it.
We don't have to end this mean we can 

367
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,050
end this rather.

368
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,390
We don't have to do any music.
Fuck it.

369
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:26,391
We're just talking a use a codeword 
Rogan and save 10 percent off any and 

370
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:28,190
all supplements.
A lot of new shit in including,

371
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,600
uh,
if you haven't had it yet though.

372
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,070
The warrior bars,
which are the most awesome fucking thing

373
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:34,910
ever.
This thing that we had made a,

374
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,490
it's an ancient lakota recipe.
It's a organic buffalo meat.

375
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,890
I'm bringing stacks of these when I go 
up to Alaska,

376
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,680
no antibiotics,
no added hormones,

377
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,310
and it's got 14 grams of protein and a 
140 calories.

378
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,390
Four grams of fat for every two hours 
serving very healthy for you.

379
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,400
All kinds of cool shit on it.
And again,

380
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:58,401
use the codeword Rogan save 10 percent 
off any and all supplements Bra and cue 

381
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:58,401
the music.

382
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Is it fucking up again?
Now you'd say he didn't want to do 

383
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:06,520
music.
So I.

384
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:06,600
Oh,
you already unplugged it.

385
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,280
That's how wonky are fucking system is.
Needed.

386
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,240
A better system,
but we can't just unplug play.

387
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,110
I usually unplug it just.
And nothing bad happens.

388
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:21,111
Like in the middle of it,
I get like an instant message or 

389
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:21,111
something.
And you're like,

390
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:23,871
what the fuck was that?
Did you get instant messages on your 

391
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:23,871
ipad?
No,

392
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:23,871
but I'm saying if something like that 
were to happen,

393
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,310
you know,
bigj lit up dog.

394
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,600
Yeah Buddy.
Thanks for coming in,

395
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:28,810
man.
Thank you for having me.

396
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:30,060
It's very exciting.
But is that,

397
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:31,850
is that an e cigarette?
You know,

398
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,620
Congress is trying to fucking band those
finally.

399
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,150
That's fine.
The stepping in,

400
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,480
the government's stepping up and ending 
these evil,

401
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:44,481
evil e-cigarettes that are stealing 
money from the mouths of the babies of 

402
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,810
the families that own the tobacco 
companies,

403
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,720
which is Marlboro.

404
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,790
Who makes your preferred brand logic.
And I deal with the logic zero.

405
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,480
No Nicotine.
Yeah.

406
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,880
Oh,
I see,

407
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,870
so it's like a,
just a habit thing.

408
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:01,630
Crutch.
Yeah,

409
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,700
but I haven't actually looked yesterday 
on my 29 days from a year.

410
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,590
That's interesting.
That's interesting.

411
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:12,591
Like a zero tobacco thing that just 
fills the habit because it's just a 

412
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:12,730
habit,
a pure water,

413
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,370
pure water vapor.
Wow.

414
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:19,371
And there's no feeling whatsoever.
Do you get like a little mental thing 

415
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:19,371
that happened?
Was mental thing?

416
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:23,661
Yeah.
When I get the itch to go with things 

417
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:23,661
I've always wanted to do.
What are you putting up?

418
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,730
They just a New York just said that now 
a e-cigarettes are allowed to have paid 

419
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,540
commercials during movies now and this 
is not,

420
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,320
they haven't had that for 16 years since
regular cigarettes were.

421
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,160
Wait a minute,
wait a minute,

422
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:38,110
wait a minute.
You mean before the movie?

423
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,280
Like paid product placements.
Oh,

424
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,250
but wait a minute,
that's not a product placement.

425
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:44,350
Is that before the movie or in the 
movie?

426
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,750
Hey,
product placements in films has been off

427
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,730
limits for tobacco companies for 16 
years,

428
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:51,360
so now they're allowed to have paper.
Like in movies there's,

429
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,580
they're allowed to be paid.
So what you're saying is like if you 

430
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,120
watched the incredibles or whatever and 
they'll pull it out.

431
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,950
Cigarettes,
they're getting paid for that.

432
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,350
It's white story.
Well,

433
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,540
I was going to say,
um,

434
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,880
oh,
what's the November man with the new 

435
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,210
one?
With the peers fellow.

436
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,120
So if he's smoking a cigarette,
it's one of those things,

437
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,420
right?

438
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,370
If he gets paid to do it,
that's so weird.

439
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,150
That's that they do that on television,
you know,

440
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:26,151
like you'll,
you'll only be able to use like Mac 

441
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:26,151
computers on some shows.
Clearly obvious to.

442
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:30,021
I was using number American idol and 
every judge happened to be drinking a 

443
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:31,470
coke turned out to the right.
Well there's that too.

444
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,230
And there's just,
there's also like on certain shows,

445
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:36,540
like you'll see everything.
Even movies you'll see,

446
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:41,541
like every product is a Sony and they'll
say they'll close up on the Sony phone 

447
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,700
when someone gets a phone call.
So you see the Sony logo and it'll be on

448
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,440
a vial laptop and you'd go,
oh,

449
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:48,570
Sony has a deal in this movie

450
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,850
actually when it's not so many,
it seems like it's always like they 

451
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,881
always use apple computers and they 
always have the sticker over the apple 

452
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:59,881
logo or iphones,
but they have the apple logo covered up 

453
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:00,270
for some reason and like every single TV
show.

454
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,450
So it's almost like apples,
like,

455
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,670
no,
obviously hold on,

456
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,200
you have to pay us to show the APP.
No,

457
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:05,890
no,
no.

458
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:08,230
You've got it totally wrong.
Totally opposite.

459
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,050
They don't get paid by apple.
So they cover it up.

460
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,840
That's what it is.
If apple paid them than they would have.

461
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,140
We're not going to advertise your thing,
but isn't it weird that it seems like 

462
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,210
every show does use apple products and 
all their shows.

463
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,510
They want to,
you know,

464
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,060
there's like a cult of apple in 
Hollywood for sure.

465
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,590
You know,
I'm not sucking my Dick,

466
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:28,100
but I did a show called P diddy's bad 
boys or comedy on Hbo.

467
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,700
And that was,
it turns out that was just an entire 

468
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,090
season of a TV show to promote Sean John
Clothing.

469
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,920
Really?
Or they made you,

470
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,360
you had to,
were showing John Closing.

471
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:43,361
Yeah.
You when you did sleep dress and 

472
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:43,361
definitely hip hop clothes.
That's great.

473
00:20:43,361 --> 00:20:46,490
It's really meant you had to wear their 
clothes to do standup and all they could

474
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:48,400
find in my was a short

475
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,000
sleeve like zip up sweater that said,
show you how across the front room.

476
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:57,010
Oh my God.
That was about 70 pounds heavier than I 

477
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,010
am now.
You did,

478
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,960
you did stand up with uh,
Sean John Shirt on because they made you

479
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:00,130
wear it.
Oh yeah.

480
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,400
I mean I did,
but coming,

481
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,180
if he was at my pant leg rolled up in my
first year of commodity,

482
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:07,450
I think one pant leg rolled up,
like ll cool J.

483
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,700
I bought it in full wigger.
I went hard on it.

484
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,840
Did you,
for how long?

485
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,270
Just you know what it was.
I figured out.

486
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:17,320
I started out in a black comedy room and
I just found out I could fucking destroy

487
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,350
if I just went right to them on that 
level.

488
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:24,430
Now I actually load that kind of comedy 
and it's fun to expose that.

489
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,770
Like the white guy who goes into a black
room just like,

490
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:31,771
come on,
y'all know when you buy a bitch or 

491
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:32,200
drank,
that bitch won't go away.

492
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,090
I'm going to go dancing with dead drunk 
bitch.

493
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:35,660
I bought it.
Yeah,

494
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,080
yeah,
yeah.

495
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:41,250
Because you know every job you up in a 
club where there's a few white guys who 

496
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:46,141
take on that role was zealous intention.
There's a few of those white guys.

497
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:51,421
There's always like one or two of those 
out there to like get known as a white 

498
00:21:51,421 --> 00:21:52,730
guy who does black rooms.
How man?

499
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,330
Well,
yeah,

500
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,230
Gary.
Oh,

501
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,500
and I've watched him.
It blows my goddamn.

502
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,000
I have no idea.
It's like,

503
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:02,020
let's say it's like listening to what?
What's funny is that when you,

504
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,050
if they turn the microphones off on the 
audience,

505
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,650
you'd be like,
and you said there was all black people 

506
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:10,650
in the audience.
You'd be like,

507
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:10,650
well,
they're probably furious right at what's

508
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,400
happening.
Like the basically being called clowns,

509
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:16,240
like they won't understand a white guy 
unless he does this and then you turn on

510
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:21,241
the volume of the audience and they're 
just roaring high five and just losing 

511
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:21,241
their shit and he'll see like,
really?

512
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:23,710
It's such like a.
it's such a grand scheme.

513
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:25,570
Pander.
It's blows my mind.

514
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,650
You're allowed to do that panda though.
As long as it's positive,

515
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,020
you're allowed to do that.
Pander.

516
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,210
Good.
It seems phony.

517
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:39,211
It seems so phone.
It seems really funny because there's 

518
00:22:39,211 --> 00:22:41,910
guys I worked with in the black circuit 
when I started that like fantastic 

519
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,781
comics,
black like bill burr used to do some of 

520
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:45,781
those rooms,
you know,

521
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,170
but isn't it weird that like no one has 
any issue whatsoever with a black guy 

522
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,910
who does like alternative comedy,
like that really dead Pan,

523
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,610
you know?
No one's going to white,

524
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,160
nerdy comedy.
No.

525
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,080
No one would say he's taking on the 
affectation of the white nerds.

526
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,190
No,
but I'll tell you what,

527
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,100
that guy eats shit.
And a real black comedy room.

528
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,340
He the black right?
The black.

529
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:14,550
The black nerd is not accepted by the 
white guy who acts like a black guy eat 

530
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,930
shit and a lot of white comedy clubs.
Yeah.

531
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:19,030
That's what happened when I first came 
to New York and I would say,

532
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,900
wow,
it's so crazy that they make you wear 

533
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,500
their clothes.
This lady would not stop hunting.

534
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,450
You couldn't for say.
No.

535
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,910
Couldn't say as a part of the part of 
the deal.

536
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,970
Yeah.
There was also some contract where a in 

537
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,890
that where it's like he was your manager
for like three years beyond that show or

538
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:46,891
something like managerial cut of 
anything because assuming anything you 

539
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:46,891
got

540
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:52,170
a moving forward from pdds baby boys of 
comedy somehow was because because of p 

541
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:52,760
diddy.
That's no joke man.

542
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:54,620
I've seen that in reality show 
contracts.

543
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:59,621
I've seen that we're friends,
we're thinking about going on a reality 

544
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:02,411
show and they brought the contract to 
someone and it turns out like say if 

545
00:24:02,411 --> 00:24:02,411
you're like,
ah,

546
00:24:02,411 --> 00:24:04,160
you know,
if they created some new show,

547
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,280
like a real housewives type show,
and then you became like the breakout 

548
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,340
star and took off and had like cookbooks
and shit.

549
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:12,800
Like a lot of these chicks do and 
started making bank.

550
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,470
They get paid.
They get a big fat piece of that.

551
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:18,530
Man That's not all yours on some of 
these contracts.

552
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,370
Oh yeah.
Because you'll be.

553
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:21,410
It'll even be called like oxygen 
networks,

554
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,450
whatever chick presents.
Yeah.

555
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:25,940
It could be when you're allowed to use 
that in your credit,

556
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,320
you know,
like as seen on Sean diddy's,

557
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,190
bad boys of comedy,
you're allowed to use that.

558
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,840
You know what I'm saying?
They'll own you like they're saying that

559
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,480
you have no value other than the value 
that they gave.

560
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:41,060
You mean they own it.
Like they don't just,

561
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:46,210
they don't benefit from having a 
talented person on a show that rewards 

562
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,541
them and gives them ratings,
which in turn gives them more 

563
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:49,541
advertising.
No,

564
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:49,541
no,
no,

565
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:49,541
no,
no.

566
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,310
They want a piece of your future 
prosperity,

567
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,760
your future prosperity based on you 
being an entertaining person that they 

568
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,871
put on television.
So not only do they want to pay people 

569
00:25:01,871 --> 00:25:04,810
just to shit tiny amount of money,
then they want to script what they're 

570
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,201
doing,
but then treat them like they're not 

571
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:08,201
even actors.
They're treating them like they're these

572
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:11,651
weird slaves.
These robots that are out there in the 

573
00:25:11,651 --> 00:25:11,651
world.
Yeah,

574
00:25:11,651 --> 00:25:12,500
because I know actors let anybody do 
that.

575
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,510
You can't,
you don't get on a Sitcom and they say,

576
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,540
okay,
we own all your book sales and you 

577
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:19,540
fucking,
you know,

578
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:19,930
anything you do in the movies or 
anything from here on.

579
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,970
But the reality stars though,
are you totally against it because 

580
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,851
there's some issue of the reality stars 
though are completely made by the 

581
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:29,290
network they are though.
But uh,

582
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,940
yeah,
but how is it any different than actors?

583
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,400
Because actors are better at it because 
there,

584
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,650
there is a skill there.
Yeah,

585
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:37,520
there's something.
It's like,

586
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,020
what about the ones that suck?

587
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,160
But I mean like,
do you think like a Snooki should always

588
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:48,100
give some kickback to Ltv to some 
degree?

589
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,800
No,
I don't.

590
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:50,900
I just recording Ramsey.
Well,

591
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:52,700
hit singles.
I think those are his shows.

592
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,410
Know he's on like four different shows.
Yeah.

593
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:56,780
But I think those are his show.
Yeah.

594
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:57,980
He creates,
you know what I'm saying?

595
00:25:57,981 --> 00:25:59,540
Like he's,
he's a pretty famous dude.

596
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:02,030
That's not a good example.
And he also has a skill.

597
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,630
It's like he's a world renowned chef.
It's not like Snooki,

598
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,020
you know what I'm saying?
I mean you're talking about the guy was 

599
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,020
already famous.
If it depends on what you do though,

600
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,981
if you're like the guy who was on the 
bachelor and he owns like a horse 

601
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:15,110
stable.
If after that show,

602
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:17,540
the horse stables business picks up 
huge.

603
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,790
I don't think there should be any 
kickback for some like that.

604
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,250
But if he does something moving on like 
another reality,

605
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:25,310
just like the bachelor all stars,
whatever thing.

606
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,110
Sure.
I think to some degree too,

607
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:32,230
I think that's crazy talk.
I think a person who working for you 

608
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,921
when they're doing something like that,
if you're a producer of a television 

609
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:36,650
show or a executive in a network or what
have you,

610
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,910
who I don't know who's getting the 
money,

611
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,280
then you hire someone.
You're hiring someone because you think 

612
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,270
that they're going to be the best 
performer in this production that you're

613
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,070
putting on.
No,

614
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,710
let's stop pretending the reality.
The only reality show is fucking cops.

615
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,810
Okay.
You know,

616
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,840
it's a reality show because one of the 
guys got shot and killed the other day 

617
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:55,840
because it's real.
Really,

618
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:55,860
really hard.
Yeah.

619
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,460
One of the sound guys and they filmed 
the whole thing like regular cops style.

620
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,790
Yeah.

621
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,650
The guy got shot and killed the fucking 
sound guy.

622
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:02,280
Did.
That's,

623
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,470
that's the only real reality videos out 
there.

624
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,150
No,
it hasn't been released yet.

625
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:08,000
It's really recent thing.
Um,

626
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,170
but when you're watching a lot of these 
shows,

627
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,780
whether it's about selling cars or you 
know,

628
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:17,781
whether it's about being in a pawn shop,
it's all rigged is everybody knows what 

629
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:21,930
the subject's going to be beforehand.
They know what the scenario is,

630
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,270
the painting.
So you're basically an actor,

631
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,430
you're in some quads.
I actor.

632
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,840
Okay.
They can't,

633
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,400
they put you on the show.
Say if we do fucking big,

634
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,040
big Jay's grill house.
And uh,

635
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,420
I decided,
fuck it,

636
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:41,540
I'm going whole hog.
And then you see like a hog spinning 

637
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:41,640
around thing.
Big Chad do stand up comedy.

638
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:44,720
But I also love cooking.
So I decided to open up and then they,

639
00:27:44,721 --> 00:27:45,300
they,
what?

640
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:47,010
They own you,
they own you,

641
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:48,210
they own a piece of you forever.

642
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,670
Shit.
The reason why they want you on the show

643
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:55,671
in the first place with some crazy 
housewives that fucking gets pilled up 

644
00:27:55,671 --> 00:27:57,810
and start screaming at people or whether
you're charlie sheen,

645
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,780
if he ever does a reality show the 
reason why they want you because because

646
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:05,781
they think people are going to tune into
you and they're going to benefit from 

647
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:05,781
that.
Like they can't.

648
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:07,330
They can't own you because they made you
fuck off.

649
00:28:07,331 --> 00:28:07,880
No,
you're right.

650
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,900
And I guess it is talking about 
originally,

651
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,130
I can't remember who you're talking 
about.

652
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,190
Not talking about anybody in specific.
I'm talking about these reality shows,

653
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,400
reality shows where they take people.
And you know,

654
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,500
we're talking about him being forced to 
wear those shirts and I'm saying that 

655
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:22,630
these,
these shows that like,

656
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,730
like him saying that he was going to be 
managing him for three years afterwards.

657
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,730
They,
they connect people in these weird ways 

658
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,000
where they'll own you for a long time 
after your thing.

659
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,830
They'll get a kickback.
But I guess you're right.

660
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:39,831
Even in the example that I use,
I guess like Snooki really like she was 

661
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:41,910
cast to do so in essence he is an actor.
When that camera's on you,

662
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:43,320
man,
let's be real.

663
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,140
It's very difficult for people to be 
themselves.

664
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,980
It's just very difficult when the 
camera's on you and say ready,

665
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:54,981
go.
You're performing whether you're 

666
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:54,981
performing in some weird sort of,
uh,

667
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:55,940
uh,
uh,

668
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,920
uh,
sitcomish reality show.

669
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:00,870
That's just not,
it's not based on real.

670
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:05,930
I know what the fuck is really going on.
Like you see Alan Thicke show what data 

671
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,460
Alan thicke had this reality show.
You would watch him and go,

672
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:11,300
why don't you just do a sitcom?
Like it's just so set up.

673
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,520
So set up everything is Gene Simmons,
things like that too,

674
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:14,670
right?

675
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,550
It's sad and I love him.
Simmons.

676
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,380
I Love Gene Simmons.
You have a kiss shirt on.

677
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,710
I love kiss.
I found a letter the other day that Paul

678
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:27,711
Stanley's coming in.
I found a letter the other day that I 

679
00:29:27,711 --> 00:29:30,800
read.
I wrote rather to some magazine when I 

680
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,290
was 11 years old.
Like a kiss letter.

681
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,430
Yeah.
My mom saved it,

682
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,650
so I'm going to bring it in.
Read it to Paul Stanley.

683
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,060
What's it?
What's this new shit?

684
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:41,180
Don't they have a new set of Gene 
Simmons show him and Paul Stanley up 

685
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,000
some arena football show.
I don't know what he was

686
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:47,250
doing,
but the reality show that reality show,

687
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,470
those are hard to watch,
especially with ones like why is Mark 

688
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,310
Walberg doing a reality?
Like killing it in life,

689
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:59,610
but yeah,
but he's getting exposed as being a 

690
00:29:59,610 --> 00:29:59,610
doofus by his reality show.
That's what I mean.

691
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,150
It makes them look like.
It just looks like it looks good.

692
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,740
Desperate move.
When it's not.

693
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,720
Well he's not.
He's a narcissistic move.

694
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:09,730
I think it's that.
I think he probably wants to help all 

695
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:09,730
those other people out.
That's helped his brothers.

696
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,510
Yeah.
He's helping his brothers and his family

697
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:15,511
out.
It's helping them like actually help 

698
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:15,511
feel like giving them money so it's like
come around a little bit.

699
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:18,310
I guess having him a part of it without 
a doubt.

700
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:23,311
I mean he's a mega movie star.
Having him a part of it ensures it's 

701
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:27,090
success.
People want to see mark Walberg hanging 

702
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:27,090
around with his family,
period.

703
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:27,790
I'll watch.
I'll watch a show,

704
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,970
a reality show that I find interesting 
to some degree at least give it a couple

705
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:32,420
of chances.
I couldn't and I.

706
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,620
I've very much enjoyed mark Walberg.
Yeah,

707
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,080
but I couldn't even drum up a reason to 
give it a shot to watch that other than 

708
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,760
other than other than to watch it for 
the wrong reasons and if he's welcoming 

709
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:44,760
that.
That's kind of weird.

710
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,330
Well,
we were saying earlier I think is really

711
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:49,480
true about these reality shows being 
completely scripted,

712
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:54,510
but the reason why is because these 
kinds of shows can happen where they're 

713
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,000
just boring.
Nothing's happening.

714
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,200
You know,
if the Kardashians are fighting with 

715
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,200
their mom or fighting with her boyfriend
and this guy's out of rehab,

716
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,750
that girl's pregnant.
It's always like something you're tuning

717
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:06,751
into,
there's always some chaos so they know 

718
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:08,761
how to hook you up with the best one is 
the best show by far and I recommend 

719
00:31:08,761 --> 00:31:10,270
that actually like watch it,
it's great.

720
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,420
Even if you skim through it on Dvr,
the bad girls club,

721
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,340
I could watch that over and over pieces 
of shit.

722
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,610
I mean these chicks are garbage and they
fight online.

723
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,990
They,
they fight over immediately out of the 

724
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:28,990
gates.
It's like,

725
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,460
this bitch thinks she's cute and they're
like,

726
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:31,360
what'd you say?
Bitch?

727
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:36,090
And then they ended the hospital fights 
fights again to the hospital will,

728
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,600
that's how they stay on television.
Oh yeah.

729
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,400
Then the producers come out and they say
like,

730
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:41,170
look,
we let you guys fight.

731
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:41,920
You know,
it happens.

732
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:43,610
But you did,
you hit her in the,

733
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,700
in the eyeball with a high heel.
So we're gonna we're gonna have to ask 

734
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:48,700
you to leave.
And that's a good teary.

735
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:48,700
Like,
you know,

736
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,330
I'm going to miss my girls.
It's fucking ridiculous.

737
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,940
Bought with Ohio.
Yeah man.

738
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:59,941
And,
and people will take things to the next 

739
00:31:59,941 --> 00:31:59,941
level because that's how you get 
noticed.

740
00:31:59,941 --> 00:32:00,520
If you don't take things to the very 
next level,

741
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,260
you don't get noticed.
Yeah,

742
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,700
I mean that's why I mean the UFC such a 
great example that buried boxing,

743
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,440
you know what I mean,
like sort of has.

744
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:12,880
Well the problem with boxing is there's 
only like a few big stars that is like a

745
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:17,881
few fights that you want to see and it's
just going to punch it like the flood 

746
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:19,780
wave of whether my Donna fight this past
weekend,

747
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,300
maybe whether there's a master,
he's a master boxer.

748
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:23,710
It's beautiful to watch.
I mean,

749
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:28,711
he really knows how to fight.
I mean he's just one of the rare real 

750
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:30,190
like him and Bernard Hopkins.
James Tony is a good example.

751
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,360
Just a real,
uh,

752
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,330
Andre Ward.
Just boxing masters.

753
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,610
Like if you understand how difficult it 
is,

754
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,130
what they're doing,
it's amazing.

755
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,980
But you're watching a guy paint a really
beautiful

756
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,980
picture where in mma you get that too 
and you get to satisfy that gladiator.

757
00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:47,260
Hers.
You want to see two guys fight.

758
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:52,290
I get my ears perk up on any time I see 
people fighting on the street or 

759
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:52,290
anything.
It's like,

760
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,250
yeah,
yeah.

761
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:54,850
Well,
the,

762
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,420
the,
this,

763
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,460
the added elements of takedowns and 
chokes and slams and it makes them more 

764
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,460
crazy kicks.
And if you're a guy who was a fighter,

765
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:04,970
if you're a young man who can box the 
reason why there's no stars,

766
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:06,190
I think you're almost like,
oh,

767
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:08,120
I could probably learn some spin kicks.
And really,

768
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,960
that's such a much more glorious way to 
win this.

769
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:11,970
You know,
the cage,

770
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,430
like,
you know,

771
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,970
Anthony Pettis,
cage kicks,

772
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,730
wins are like the prettiest thing you've
ever better than any,

773
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,670
you know,
or,

774
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,700
or at least tied with any great Tyson 
knockout it.

775
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,840
Uh,
there's that fight that we were talking 

776
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,330
about earlier where a student,
as a black girl attacks,

777
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,430
uh,
a teacher and start slapping.

778
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,430
Don't,
don't say what it is and show it.

779
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,080
All right,
we're going to get in trouble for this.

780
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,570
Now there's this world star hip hop.
No,

781
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:43,070
I think it's the news was on the news as
someone film it with their iphone.

782
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,880
So it happened.
Yeah.

783
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,370
No.

784
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,570
Oh my God.
She's attacking the teacher.

785
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,410
Whoa.
This is crazy.

786
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,720
This chicken just swinging at the 
teacher.

787
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,000
Oh,
judo,

788
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,100
hip toss her and held her down.

789
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,190
Whoa,
that's crazy.

790
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,300
That's cool.
Needs crazy.

791
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:16,680
Joe Clark.
Holy.

792
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,750
They need to lean on me.
Principal.

793
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,960
I think I would have went more crazy.
He handled it way better than if that 

794
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:23,960
chick started slapping me.
Well,

795
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,250
this is.
This gets into the subject of what we're

796
00:34:26,251 --> 00:34:29,940
talking about the other day with a 
Anthony Kumiai getting hit on the street

797
00:34:29,941 --> 00:34:32,790
while he's taking photographs.
People don't react well.

798
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,710
Deck.
I reacted very well to getting hit.

799
00:34:34,711 --> 00:34:37,830
He didn't hit back.
A lot of people just hit back when they,

800
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,920
when they get hit and if you're.
Especially if you're a man and you're 

801
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,710
hitting a woman,
anytime people are hitting people.

802
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:46,170
If a woman hits you,
it's fucking dangerous,

803
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:51,171
man.
Getting punched in the face is like 

804
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:53,720
everybody thinks that a woman could 
punch you in the face and you're going 

805
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:53,720
to be fine.
Like,

806
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,230
no.
There's a lot of women that are knock 

807
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,230
you the fuck out man.

808
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,330
If they.
Especially if they connect on your jaw,

809
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,150
you can't be hitting people and if you 
can't,

810
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,890
you know,
if you do hit people,

811
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,100
man,
you gotta be really careful who you're 

812
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,100
hitting because if they hit you back,
like if that guy just decided to tee off

813
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,961
on that check,
I mean you see through her to the 

814
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:14,481
ground.
That's a guy who knows martial arts for 

815
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:16,581
sure,
and he was avoiding all of her hitting 

816
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:16,581
him,
but he wasn't hitting her back.

817
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:16,581
But if he did,
man,

818
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:20,190
you're running in flailing your arms and
some guy uncorked one on your face.

819
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,960
You fall back,
you're unconscious,

820
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:26,961
you're going to bounce your head off the
ground and sometimes people die from 

821
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:27,990
that shit and that's a real problem.
When people get knocked out,

822
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:31,200
they fall down and they hit their head 
on the ground and die.

823
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:36,230
It's like you're pretty much maybe 
having a really bad car accident with 

824
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,230
your face,
which yeah,

825
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,950
it's just like that.

826
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,320
It's,
the ground is completely like,

827
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,170
there's,
there's,

828
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,990
it resists 100 percent.
Like there's no give to it.

829
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,170
Like if you fall in dirt,
you're going to be probably okay.

830
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,910
You know,
like if you fall in a grassy area,

831
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,920
you'll get a concussion,
but you might crack your head wide open 

832
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,560
if you fall on concrete block.
I've seen him like a bowling ball.

833
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:00,390
You ever talked a bowling ball,
that sound?

834
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,010
Imagine that your head and the amount of
distance that your head travels of,

835
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:07,530
you're a six foot tall man and someone 
knocks you out.

836
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,020
You're probably going to travel a good 
five and a half,

837
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,130
six feet.
I mean,

838
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,830
depending on how you're standing,
you go unconscious.

839
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:18,870
You're,
that's a lot of probably more than six 

840
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:18,870
feet because it's,
you know,

841
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:23,100
you're going to fall back first to.
I mean there's probably going to be a 

842
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,290
lot of momentum connected to your head 
bouncing off that concrete.

843
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,030
It's awful.
It's awful.

844
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,610
Those fucking videos freak me out,
man.

845
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,730
It was a five videos,
face kicks and stuff.

846
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:37,380
I can't believe I'm almost like so 
shocked at the mentality of someone that

847
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:42,381
can do inflict harm on somebody.
I always think that there's a lot of 

848
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:44,550
them out there that people aren't aware 
of,

849
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,950
so I'm not shocked when I see it.
I'm always like,

850
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,120
I fucking knew it.
I know there's people like that out 

851
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,771
there.
I know there's people that have 

852
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:54,771
experienced this awful shit from the 
time they were born.

853
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:59,870
If you grow up in a household where 
everybody's beating the fuck out of 

854
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,661
everybody and you go to school and 
people beat the fuck out of everybody 

855
00:37:02,661 --> 00:37:05,481
and you see abuse and you see people 
going to jail left and right and life 

856
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:08,430
has no value and you've seen people die.
That's what you're seeing when you watch

857
00:37:08,431 --> 00:37:13,431
those Worldstar hip hop tapes were a 
dudes out cold and guys are running by 

858
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:13,710
just punting them in the head.

859
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,210
I've seen a bunch of those.
Yeah,

860
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:16,230
me too.
I was always like,

861
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:19,320
it's like it's shocking that someone can
do it to somebody else.

862
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,470
That's a wake up call for people.
Unless you're in.

863
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:26,540
If your life was directly threatened and
you were in that kind of a rage maybe,

864
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,530
but I mean once somebody down like I 
don't know.

865
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:29,490
I've been in.
I've been in,

866
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,700
let's say for a,
for a guy my age,

867
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,650
a decent amount of street fights in my 
life,

868
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:38,040
but I've never.
I've never had like a kill urge ever,

869
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,150
you know,
I've lost,

870
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:40,180
I've won,
but even when I,

871
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,420
when like when it's over,
it's kind of over,

872
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:47,421
you know what I mean?
I've never like tried to put somebody 

873
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:47,421
like that,
you know?

874
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:48,290
It will depend on why you're fighting.
Right.

875
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,960
But even if like,
I don't know if it was a guy beating the

876
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:53,900
shit out of your girlfriend,
you know what I'm saying?

877
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,020
Sure.
You know what I'm saying?

878
00:37:55,021 --> 00:38:00,021
Like what if you pulled up somewhere and
just got there right when a guy was 

879
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:02,070
beating the shit out of your garage.
I'm not saying not to knock them out,

880
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,990
but I mean like to punch somebody's 
head.

881
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:08,991
Like I don't know if that,
I just don't know where my killer rage 

882
00:38:08,991 --> 00:38:08,991
kicks in.
Like actual murderous rage.

883
00:38:08,991 --> 00:38:10,340
I don't know where that level is in me.
Yeah,

884
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,690
I think it's pretty deep.
I'm pretty mellow dude.

885
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,050
I've.
Yeah,

886
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,180
but I think if you were confronted,
I mean you might be,

887
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:16,260
I don't know,
I don't know you,

888
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,500
but if you were confronted by someone 
that you were trying to protect someone 

889
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:21,870
that you cared about very much in trying
to protect them,

890
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:27,080
that some people get murdered us when 
they feel like someone is being like 

891
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,080
someone's trying to murder someone you 
love.

892
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,660
That's when people get murderous,
you know?

893
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:34,670
That's a common one,
but I'm saying my point is being like a 

894
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,180
street,
I promise the situations

895
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,520
where on the world star hip hop videos 
where guys are getting face punted,

896
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:42,160
I promise they weren't.
It wasn't calling for that.

897
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:47,210
Yeah.
You most likely punting a guy who was 

898
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,141
already unconscious,
seen a few of them where it's people 

899
00:38:49,141 --> 00:38:49,141
just being drunk.
Idiots laughing,

900
00:38:49,141 --> 00:38:52,910
laughing or talking shit or starting a 
fight when they were too drunk and they 

901
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,401
got knocked out and then once they were 
out everybody just started taking free 

902
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:56,401
shots at him.
Did you oversee that?

903
00:38:56,401 --> 00:39:00,780
It's literally the worst people in the 
world quite possibly.

904
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:06,390
And I think you would agree,
especially someone who's trained in 

905
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,881
martial arts,
so use what you have and have you ever 

906
00:39:08,881 --> 00:39:10,360
seen that video of the God,
the weird homeless black guy who's crazy

907
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:12,420
and he goes into the karate studio?
Yeah.

908
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,100
And they kill them and they.
I don't know if he's dead,

909
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:17,680
but that was supposedly what happened 
was he died,

910
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,370
mean the noise he's making after that 
access and what's,

911
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,110
what's ridiculous about it.

912
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:28,110
It was such a,
a cock wagging because the reason that 

913
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,860
guy went so far is because when he was 
trying to like do a show off,

914
00:39:29,861 --> 00:39:32,260
like Oh,
let me stand up and fight this guy.

915
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,350
And like,
you know,

916
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,410
shut him up.
He wasn't doing very good.

917
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,040
The karate guy was beating his ass in 
this fight.

918
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:44,041
Like that is weird.
I was actually like giving them a hard 

919
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:44,230
time to some degree.
Guy Knew how to fight a little bit,

920
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,790
you know?
The other guy knew how to fight a little

921
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:46,570
bit.
The guy got killed.

922
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,900
Yeah,
he definitely thinks,

923
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:48,540
oh really?
Yeah,

924
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,380
enough that he had been in fights 
before,

925
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,390
you know,
he wasn't totally helpless.

926
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,600
The guy beat the shit out of him,
but you were right in the beginning.

927
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,230
He wasn't getting the best out of it.
Yeah.

928
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,240
I think the guy had probably mean he 
must have had some street fighting.

929
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,400
It was also crazy.
He's crazy.

930
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:09,570
But the guy,
the guy thought he was going to go kind 

931
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:09,570
of like knock them around a bit and make
them look stupid,

932
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:13,981
but it was taking them long.
We should snope stack because I don't 

933
00:40:13,981 --> 00:40:13,981
even know if that's true.
Uh,

934
00:40:13,981 --> 00:40:17,490
you know,
man kills man and Kerr.

935
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:22,590
Homeless man in Karate Academy now feel 
racist for assuming he's homeless.

936
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,950
I don't know if that was the story.
Always was guys black and crazy.

937
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:30,910
It's probably homeless in Karate 
Academy.

938
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,240
Snopes.
Let's see.

939
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,970
Karate instructor on official Dot Com.
Murder of mentally challenged,

940
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,850
man.
Yeah.

941
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,450
It seems like it really happened man.
But I mean those face stomps,

942
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:51,451
like what kind of human being does that 
Kinda gotten the kind of guy who gets a 

943
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:54,230
buzz cut and grows a mustache and he 
works in a karate school.

944
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,810
Do you know what I mean?
Like that guy seems like,

945
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,760
not that you can't be crazy and be all 
those things but doesn't seem like it 

946
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:01,760
goes a little put together.
Well,

947
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,390
the guy who was the main guy was a 
marine.

948
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,860
He's a karate instructor and uh,
he let his,

949
00:41:08,861 --> 00:41:13,861
uh,
his student who fought this guy and the 

950
00:41:13,861 --> 00:41:17,740
student allegedly actually killed this 
guy is the real,

951
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,160
the real life Cobra Pies for federal 
real evil karate teacher.

952
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,480
Yeah.
But there's a thing,

953
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,310
man,
that people do.

954
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,100
Um,
there's a video,

955
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,130
Brian,
if you want to pull it up.

956
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:32,620
Well actually we probably shouldn't see 
someone getting killed right up.

957
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,100
I mean it's online,
but it's

958
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,880
really,
it's,

959
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,620
it's a tough one to watch even.
Well that's a,

960
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,150
he was up for assault in the 18th of the
month on an unregulated charge.

961
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:49,210
Wow.
So I don't know what the fuck I'm 

962
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:49,670
thinking if it's true.
You think with that kind of evidence,

963
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:52,490
should that guy die?
Okay.

964
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:57,491
This is stupid man.
They don't know what the fuck they're 

965
00:41:57,491 --> 00:41:57,491
talking about.
Hold on a second.

966
00:41:57,491 --> 00:42:00,940
This is one of the things it says 
sources in the medical and law 

967
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,521
enforcement community.
The tech community tell us that indeed 

968
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,940
the victim must have died.
The snoring at the end,

969
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,980
a so called agonal,
agonal breathing and assign have massive

970
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:12,320
brain damage and impending death.
That's just not true.

971
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,000
It isn't true.
When you get knocked out,

972
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:19,001
you snore.
That's whoever said that has never seen 

973
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:19,040
someone get knocked the fuck out.
When people get knocked out,

974
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,300
they have that horrible snoring.

975
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,610
It happens all the time.
That's really scary.

976
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,220
Shit.
Scary Shit.

977
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,600
First Time I saw it,
I was 16.

978
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:32,620
I saw so many laid out just it doesn't 
mean they're going to die.

979
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,120
That's not true at all.
So whoever wrote the store,

980
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:40,121
I don't believe him.
This guy should come out and do a show 

981
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:44,410
before.
Just comes to you as like a diagonal 

982
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:44,410
face to face or just get the foot 
footprint.

983
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,380
It's still,
it's all.

984
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:50,381
I'm a VIP.
There's a video of it and there's all 

985
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:53,441
these stories of it,
but none of them substantiate any like 

986
00:42:53,441 --> 00:42:56,291
legal stuff.
I guess you'd have to look into it deep 

987
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:56,570
enough,
but apparently this shit was a long time

988
00:42:56,571 --> 00:43:01,571
ago.
It looked like it was a long time based 

989
00:43:01,571 --> 00:43:02,270
on the theory that if he did die,
do you think that guy deserves to die?

990
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,640
The guy who did it,
the guy who died deserves to die early,

991
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,860
go killed the guy killed them.

992
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,870
Well,
with that kind of evidence,

993
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:12,680
like it's clearly from that.
It's clear that they were fighting.

994
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,770
I don't know what the conversation was 
that lead that guy to be fighting that 

995
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:19,850
guy.
I don't know if he said,

996
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:21,260
I'm going to come in and fight to the 
death.

997
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,840
I don't know what I'm saying.
You know what I'm saying?

998
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:29,470
It didn't seem like that kind of a dark 
underground like cooma taste situations 

999
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,080
place in Des Moines,
Iowa.

1000
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,630
It was a think it was in somewhere in 
Georgia,

1001
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,850
but anyway,
the guy was a schizophrenic,

1002
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,190
so it really doesn't matter what he 
said.

1003
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,770
He's crazy.
I mean that's what happened in Virginia.

1004
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:42,800
December 13th,
1984 and he's obviously crazy.

1005
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,200
That's the thing.
He walks in,

1006
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:44,860
you're like,
this guy's a.

1007
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:49,970
and you could have,
you see that guy literally also could 

1008
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,290
have hugged him and that would have 
ended the situation.

1009
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:56,360
You know what I mean?
There's the thing that happens in 

1010
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,971
martial arts schools though,
where if you're running a martial arts 

1011
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:01,271
school,
crazy people will show up and they'll 

1012
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:01,271
start like,
they'll start shit.

1013
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,360
I've seen it.
I've seen it firsthand.

1014
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:05,060
I've seen it at my taekwondo school.
He would mind,

1015
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,120
my instructor would take guys like that,
that would come into schools and he 

1016
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,750
would make them spar with black belts 
and put them just like,

1017
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:12,560
you know,
he go,

1018
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:17,561
okay,
so you have to fight you a pretty good 

1019
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:17,561
guy,
right?

1020
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:17,561
Uh,
we're gonna do some sparring here.

1021
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:17,650
Okay.
Um,

1022
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,550
you have your gear,
we have gift for you.

1023
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:24,551
Do you have you again?
And he would like lower these guys in 

1024
00:44:24,551 --> 00:44:24,980
because they would come to school and 
they would go,

1025
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:27,590
you all false master,
you all false master.

1026
00:44:27,591 --> 00:44:30,110
You don't truly know martial arts.
And you know,

1027
00:44:30,111 --> 00:44:31,290
they try to reason them.

1028
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,280
Listen sir,
you know,

1029
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:33,030
you can,
uh,

1030
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:38,770
was the Blue Tang clan class,
but you can't yell things out like 

1031
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:42,141
people.
There's people that will come in that 

1032
00:44:42,141 --> 00:44:42,750
have real mental issues and they can be 
dangerous.

1033
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:47,810
You know,
they also could be martial arts trained 

1034
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,671
too.
There's a lot of people that just 

1035
00:44:49,671 --> 00:44:49,671
learned how to throw kicks and punches 
from friends.

1036
00:44:49,671 --> 00:44:54,080
Like like if you teach an athletic 
person how to deliver a good straight 

1037
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,410
punch and just show them the mechanics 
of it and they practice on a heavy bag,

1038
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,680
they'll can fuck you up if they hit.
You don't really have to be really well 

1039
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,271
trained and disciplined and so there's a
lot of people that have martial arts 

1040
00:45:05,271 --> 00:45:06,870
abilities like the ability to punch you 
really hard in the face,

1041
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,780
but they don't really know how to fight.
They don't.

1042
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:14,781
They've never been formally trained,
but they might charge you and punch you 

1043
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:14,781
in the face and they can be really 
dangerous.

1044
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:16,560
So if you're in a sort of a scenario 
like that,

1045
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,860
a lot of times these martial arts 
instructors are forced to defend 

1046
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,921
themselves against these crazy people.
That didn't seem like that didn't seem 

1047
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:26,490
like that in this video and this video,
it seemed like they lured the guy in,

1048
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,020
set them up,
beat the shit out of him to.

1049
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,620
The saddest part is at one point during 
like when they're just kind of like,

1050
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:36,170
it almost seems like slap boxing.
The homeless guy stops me.

1051
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,260
He goes,
your good,

1052
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:40,680
your good.
Yeah.

1053
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:42,390
It's kind of a fucked up video.
Any.

1054
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,340
And he does.
He starts saying don't stop.

1055
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:48,480
At one point he does tell him to stop 
and then it just stopped and spit on him

1056
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:50,850
while he's down.
It's gross.

1057
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,360
I don't know if the guy died,
but if the guy did die.

1058
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:56,010
Yeah,
that's basically murder.

1059
00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:01,070
I mean it's like perfect example.
What we said is where would that 

1060
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:05,511
murderous rage come out?
Would it come out if someone was trying 

1061
00:46:05,511 --> 00:46:08,721
to kill your mom,
you probably would probably would come 

1062
00:46:08,721 --> 00:46:08,721
out,
but this guy wasn't in that scenario.

1063
00:46:08,721 --> 00:46:13,521
This guy was like,
the guy was saying don't like he was 

1064
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,791
saying stop.
He'd given up like a healthy person 

1065
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:17,910
backs away at that point.
It's like it's merciless.

1066
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:22,290
It's just complete like drilling.
I think I was so offended somehow,

1067
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,250
but I wonder if they just got away with 
shit like that and this was the only one

1068
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:31,251
that people saw.
Like a wonder if this had happened more 

1069
00:46:31,251 --> 00:46:33,000
than once because like if a guy's 
willing to be the guy to death like that

1070
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:38,001
and then dispose of a body and this is 
the only piece of evidence that some 

1071
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:38,400
schizophrenia guy was murdered like 
that.

1072
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,610
Motherfuckers probably killed a bunch of
people before and he's a marine.

1073
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,880
That's the other thing.
We don't know what kind of action he 

1074
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:46,880
saw.
You know,

1075
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:46,880
if you,
if you have,

1076
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,360
you know,
you're serving your country and you're 

1077
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:51,360
used to killing people on a regular 
basis,

1078
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,460
then you come back home and some fucking
crazy skitzo guy wants to come into 

1079
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:55,460
karate school and talk shit.
Yeah,

1080
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,970
you'll get a guy killed him.
Like why not?

1081
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:59,700
You've been telling people for years in 
the eighties.

1082
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:02,370
That was like how they yell.
Previewed like karate schools.

1083
00:47:02,371 --> 00:47:07,350
Like how many homeless guys if you 
killed three homeless guys and counting.

1084
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,520
I was a part of many challenge matches 
where people showed up at the school and

1085
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:14,310
then I got to watch them fight friends.
I,

1086
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,530
I fought dudes that just showed up at 
the school.

1087
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,950
That was a super common thing,
but you can more or less with that.

1088
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,870
Well,
we took them to deliver a couple.

1089
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,010
Really?
Oh yeah.

1090
00:47:23,011 --> 00:47:24,810
We took a lot of those guys to the 
hospital.

1091
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:29,811
After we beat them up,
we'd bring them to the hospital after 

1092
00:47:29,811 --> 00:47:29,811
they spark,
but easily could have happened

1093
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,480
to me.
I mean I was good,

1094
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,270
but there's a lot of good guys that came
into.

1095
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,030
There were guys that had,
they had talent.

1096
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,340
There's a lot of fight where you put on 
gloves.

1097
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,870
Depends.
Depends on what they said.

1098
00:47:42,871 --> 00:47:44,580
A lot of it was bare knuckle.
Really?

1099
00:47:44,581 --> 00:47:45,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

1100
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:50,570
Because you,
you never know like what they wanted to 

1101
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:50,570
prove.
You know what is.

1102
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,500
I've never,
and I've never been good at it.

1103
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:55,650
Even back in school when it was the meet
me at the library,

1104
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:59,940
I'd throw a punch then.
See I say that because I was like,

1105
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,350
let's say if I got to think about till 
three,

1106
00:48:01,351 --> 00:48:06,351
I probably won't show.
Like I'll probably chicken out like 

1107
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:06,351
later.
Like I'm angry now.

1108
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:06,990
Let's just do it.
Let's get into it.

1109
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:07,940
That's probably the

1110
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:12,970
best way to get everything broken up and
keep it from being like something that 

1111
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,130
no teachers or adults know about.
The problem is if you go on a field,

1112
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,970
meet me in the field and it's like 
children,

1113
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:19,520
someone can get killed.
Yeah.

1114
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,280
The Lord of the flies.
I had to do that a few times.

1115
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,850
It's with bullies and it always sucked,
but always it turned out me beating them

1116
00:48:25,851 --> 00:48:26,660
up.
So it was great.

1117
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,310
What kind of bullies did you beat up?
High.

1118
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:34,360
One was all girl.
One is now a one is now a cop and the 

1119
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,120
other guy thinks is dead.
Most of them,

1120
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,060
most of the guys who talk the most shit 
though,

1121
00:48:38,061 --> 00:48:41,450
just never had to really be with 
somebody like stepping up to it.

1122
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,290
Yeah.
When you're a kid,

1123
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,150
everyone's Kinda.
I mean I bought into it too.

1124
00:48:44,151 --> 00:48:49,151
That's why I said,
but whatever it was instilled in me by 

1125
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,900
my dad and step up was like very much 
like get it going while you're angry.

1126
00:48:50,901 --> 00:48:51,710
You know what I mean?
Like don't,

1127
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,170
don't wait for it.
And that's why,

1128
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,040
uh,
what I was going to ask when they'd come

1129
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:55,730
in and they'd say like,
you know,

1130
00:48:55,731 --> 00:48:58,420
Rogan,
go teach this punk or lesson,

1131
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,720
like,
like what was going on,

1132
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:01,950
he'd

1133
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,180
get nervous as fuck.
But the idea behind it was my instructor

1134
00:49:05,181 --> 00:49:07,940
was training a bunch of people for 
National Tournament's.

1135
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,150
So the idea was like,
these guys can hang with you,

1136
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:16,210
you're a national level competitor and 
this is a good thing to experience 

1137
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:16,580
because it's very dangerous.
So you're going to be able to,

1138
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,070
you're going to have to perform under 
some very real pressure,

1139
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,860
like people just swinging at your face 
and you know,

1140
00:49:21,861 --> 00:49:23,900
you're,
you're dancing around inside this closed

1141
00:49:23,901 --> 00:49:26,900
area looking to knock each other out.
And it happened a lot.

1142
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:27,710
It happened,
I mean,

1143
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,930
not a lot,
but it happened every three,

1144
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:33,500
four months over the course of like 
seven years that I was there,

1145
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,560
every three or four months,
some guy from another school would come 

1146
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:38,560
into town and would want to show people 
up.

1147
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,241
We'd like,
you want to show everybody how much 

1148
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:43,241
better his style was and people would 
duke it out.

1149
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:43,850
It was,
it was crazy.

1150
00:49:43,851 --> 00:49:48,851
When you stop and think about it,
this is all pre UFC and there was a lot 

1151
00:49:48,851 --> 00:49:52,661
of delusional people too.
There was a lot of people that thought 

1152
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:52,661
their martial art literally could not be
beaten,

1153
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:57,520
but they did a certain type of wing 
Chung and if they could go to a 

1154
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:57,520
taekwondo school and spa,
they would just run through people.

1155
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,850
That would be no way they could stop 
them.

1156
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,370
Did you get half off your monthly dues 
if he won the fight?

1157
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:06,620
I didn't.
I didn't pay after a certain amount of 

1158
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,750
time.
I taught so three homeless people.

1159
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,630
Even when I was a kid,
I started out when I was really young.

1160
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:14,690
I was like,
when I was 15 I was completely dedicated

1161
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:18,200
and I was there every day so they would 
give me things to do.

1162
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,410
They would give me like a clean things 
or teach classes.

1163
00:50:21,411 --> 00:50:26,411
I taught a lot of private lessons,
like the people that are first starting 

1164
00:50:26,411 --> 00:50:28,931
out,
you have to learn in a private lesson 

1165
00:50:28,931 --> 00:50:28,931
for them and since I advanced

1166
00:50:28,931 --> 00:50:30,230
really quickly and I'd spent so much 
time there,

1167
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:33,650
I was pretty good at breaking down the 
technical aspects of like certain moves.

1168
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,900
You know,
it's funny and pardon the,

1169
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,830
the hand job here,
but I think you're a fantastic comedian.

1170
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:45,010
Super funny and you have such the origin
story of a guy who would not be good,

1171
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:51,670
but yet I know a few people like that to
have people that are very like strict 

1172
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:55,361
and life about certain things.
Mike Vecchione hilarious comedian 

1173
00:50:55,361 --> 00:50:55,620
standing is like a very like regimented 
guy.

1174
00:50:55,621 --> 00:50:58,040
Grew up football.
He was good at it.

1175
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:01,520
He excelled wrestling.
Went to Penn state wrestling there,

1176
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,710
you know,
and then but hilarious comedian,

1177
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,750
but it usually,
it doesn't breed the funny guy.

1178
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,010
Yeah.
I think the introvert or the or the,

1179
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:14,020
you know,
the weird kind of like social awkward 

1180
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,020
guy or the class clown type goes onto 
that.

1181
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,840
But it's usually someone,
someone's like a strict,

1182
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:15,210
like,
you know,

1183
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,630
usually that story becomes like,
you know,

1184
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:23,020
I have four kids,
they all wear dockers and fucking 

1185
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,020
sweaters.
No one says fucking,

1186
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,550
but I'm not like a,
I'm not strict.

1187
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:28,070
I just get into things.
I'm just very motivated.

1188
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,280
Like I'm a more like,
I wouldn't say I'm disciplined as much 

1189
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,030
as I get more obsessed,
you know,

1190
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,950
discipline and things that I'm obsessed 
about.

1191
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,830
But I'm not like a strict person.
And then the other way,

1192
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:44,860
like I'm not,
I'm just saying usually the comics who 

1193
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:48,200
like a guy who's in shape and doing 
comedy and like cares about that and 

1194
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,880
cares about his health just tends to not
always be.

1195
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:50,830
It's usually a guy,
it's like,

1196
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:52,640
you know,
some fucking,

1197
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:54,350
some pig the other day,
you know,

1198
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:58,400
this fat broad because you know,
at 165 pounds you slob,

1199
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,660
you know,
just being like that.

1200
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,100
And you're like,
who's relating to this?

1201
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,580
Right.
And you definitely transcend that.

1202
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:07,030
But I mean that's what I'm saying.
It's weird that a,

1203
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,830
I don't think that always happens.
I think it's more of an odd thing.

1204
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:11,510
I think for the God's sake,
you know,

1205
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,170
so I was getting,
it's when all,

1206
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:18,190
all of your um,
like flaws kind of become your virtues 

1207
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:18,220
and comedy,
you know,

1208
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:23,230
so the narrowed who got beat up and now 
he's telling us stories about getting 

1209
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:23,840
beaten up and now girls will fuck them 
because he knows how to tell a funny.

1210
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,500
Do you know what I mean?
That's usually the origin story.

1211
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,840
Yeah.
But it doesn't have to be.

1212
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:29,720
So that's the cool thing about comedy is
there's so many versions,

1213
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:34,750
you know,
like black guys have always had that 

1214
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,541
thing where they're allowed to dress up 
really cool on stage where gold chains 

1215
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:40,150
and crazy leather outfits like remember 
Eddie Murphy and yet lyricists and.

1216
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:45,750
But it's the entire difference of black 
comedy and white comedy if you're gonna 

1217
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:50,080
take by those circuits.
I said there's definitely comics that 

1218
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,601
bridge both worlds,
but the difference in is like white 

1219
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:54,680
mainstream comedy is very self 
deprecating.

1220
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:57,080
You know,
it's like my little Dick fat guy,

1221
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,310
bald,
whatever it is.

1222
00:52:58,850 --> 00:52:59,750
And black is rare.
Like,

1223
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,460
so I'm slinging the Dick,
right?

1224
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:06,230
And it's just like,
I mean fucking a stool at a black comedy

1225
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:11,231
club is probably owed a lot of money in 
civil court to just like been fucked 

1226
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,350
here just off the side stages.
There's a bunch of like broken up stools

1227
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,300
from a,
from gang rapings.

1228
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:20,420
I mean there's so like.
But when I would watch,

1229
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:25,840
I grew up like a big fan of comedy and 
watching like one that in the eighties 

1230
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,070
and I would watch two

1231
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,140
to getting to where def jam became the 
thing.

1232
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,990
I loved all that too.
I just didn't even know.

1233
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:33,750
I almost didn't even notice the 
difference that comedy taken a turn.

1234
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:38,751
So like you know,
how good yard [inaudible] and how big 

1235
00:53:38,751 --> 00:53:41,010
your Dick is.
Well it's comedy can be anything,

1236
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:42,660
man.
It's just got to be funny.

1237
00:53:42,661 --> 00:53:45,990
That's what people don't understand.
Like if anybody wants to say that.

1238
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:51,050
Like I've heard people say this,
this is like a social justice warrior 

1239
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:51,540
thing.
They say that real comedy always punches

1240
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:55,650
up meaning like get it,
get at the bad person that's above you,

1241
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:57,120
dominating you.
The boss,

1242
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:02,330
the president pushes up and you know,
you don't pick on any people that are 

1243
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:07,311
below you,
but the reality is sometimes punching 

1244
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:07,390
down it's fucking hilarious.
Sure.

1245
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,300
It's not,
it's not always,

1246
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,000
but it's about what is the subject 
matter,

1247
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,840
like what it like.

1248
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:18,020
You could like,
I remember Louis Ck doing a bit about 

1249
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:18,020
how his kid is a fucking asshole.
Sure.

1250
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,460
And it was really fucking funny because 
first of all,

1251
00:54:20,461 --> 00:54:22,830
you knew he wasn't serious.
It was.

1252
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,000
I mean he was talking about his kid,
like in a frustrated way about a kid.

1253
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:28,740
Just being a kid.
I'm sure he loves his kid.

1254
00:54:28,741 --> 00:54:31,430
Like he loves life itself,
but because he's,

1255
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,420
he's punching down,
he's making.

1256
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,240
He's like shitting on his kid for being 
an asshole.

1257
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:36,690
Sure,
sure.

1258
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,630
And it's hilarious.
It's like there's no rules,

1259
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,300
there's no rules like a guy has to be 
self deprecating.

1260
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,850
The guy saying,
so I'm slinging that Dick,

1261
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:46,620
right?
I'm given that deck.

1262
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:51,621
You know when you give,
giving that good tick and you feel that 

1263
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,150
as whole reverberating off your ball 
sack every time you come down home with 

1264
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:56,130
little loop the loop,
you can be crying,

1265
00:54:56,131 --> 00:54:57,390
laughing,
listening to that,

1266
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,730
crying,
laughing or you could be crying,

1267
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:01,720
laughing,
listening to a guy who talks about it.

1268
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:06,450
We can never get laid.
The variable in those things is just,

1269
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,420
is it funny or is it not funny?
That's the important variable.

1270
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,480
We.
Me and my buddy washed nick Nikennon 

1271
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:14,480
special.
You want to have fun man.

1272
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,780
Get stoned and just watching nick cannon
special.

1273
00:55:15,781 --> 00:55:20,781
It's just if you like.
I love watching just ridiculously 

1274
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:23,130
horrible comedy.
It's my favorite thing in the world.

1275
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:28,570
Good and just watching the Canon by an 
hour of television so he can slowly but 

1276
00:55:29,011 --> 00:55:34,011
surely peel down from a Tuxedo to a tank
top is one of the first week as a 

1277
00:55:34,561 --> 00:55:37,350
backdrop.
That's just a million light bulbs,

1278
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,930
so when he moves it's going to give you 
a fucking seizure.

1279
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,970
And his jokes,
we're all like,

1280
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:47,210
you know,
you meet a girl up in a club and you're 

1281
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,831
all like splatoon just noises.
And then apparently Brian,

1282
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,960
Gary was texting that night,
like live tweeting or whatever,

1283
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,780
but she goes,
I told you my baby was funny.

1284
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,750
Oh my God,
I love that.

1285
00:55:57,751 --> 00:56:01,170
If you want to watch a show that just 
bring joy to your life.

1286
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,450
Have you ever heard of Bill Bellamy's 
who got jokes?

1287
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,360
Oh,
well,

1288
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:10,130
just take a weekend and really dig into 
it because it's A.

1289
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,420
I don't think I have it in me.
It's a comedy.

1290
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:13,950
Yeah.
You don't like watching bad comedy?

1291
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,150
No.
This is.

1292
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,830
It's on tv one,
which is a black TV network.

1293
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,000
I didn't know that existed.
Yeah,

1294
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,880
it's called TV One and Bill Bellamy 
hosted a isn't on top.

1295
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:31,980
No,
it's done now I think to Tommy from 

1296
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,830
Martin,
but it airs on marathons,

1297
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:35,560
on this network.
Tommy from Martin is the column,

1298
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:40,590
the Pope of comedy.
He sits on the throne and judges as 

1299
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:43,480
three comics come out and they do.
The first round is just,

1300
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:48,481
they're set in front of an audience and 
there's three people from the audience 

1301
00:56:48,481 --> 00:56:50,350
picked at random to be the judges where 
they give a score from one to five,

1302
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,600
five being the best,
one being the worst.

1303
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:58,350
Everyone gets a five.
And if you give someone a for the 

1304
00:56:58,350 --> 00:56:59,410
audience loses their shit,
they get very mad at you.

1305
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,800
That's around one.
The comedy is always got awful.

1306
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:04,470
And then,
uh,

1307
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,770
it unprepared,
usually it looks like the,

1308
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,890
these guys,
another we're going to do a TV show that

1309
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,710
day and uh,
and then round two,

1310
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:16,711
they come out and they do some kind of 
challenge that you don't under which 

1311
00:57:16,711 --> 00:57:19,490
they have a heckler in the audience or 
somebody comes out like actually 

1312
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:22,670
actually a producer and hit you in the 
face with a pie and you got to keep 

1313
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:25,201
going.
And then they judge you score from one 

1314
00:57:25,201 --> 00:57:27,670
to five and it's just horrible,
horrible comedy.

1315
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,580
But it makes me laugh.
Like,

1316
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,280
why does that make you laugh?
Just because it works.

1317
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:38,281
I'm amazed by I'm very interested and 
that there's actually a science to 

1318
00:57:39,491 --> 00:57:40,000
comedy.

1319
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,960
Don't you find that interesting?
There's like actual science,

1320
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:46,961
so you could just say the right words.
Have you ever seen a comedy hypnotist 

1321
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:48,520
now?
Never seen one of those guys.

1322
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:51,160
Dude,
you got to see a comedy hypnotist.

1323
00:57:51,161 --> 00:57:52,600
If you get a chance,
a real ones,

1324
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:55,350
I just assume it's fake.
You know,

1325
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,480
not fake at all.
There's something that really stupid 

1326
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,330
people are susceptible to that you're 
not susceptible to.

1327
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:04,960
There's someone can like say some things
to you onstage,

1328
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,440
snap their finger and some people 
literally go into a trance.

1329
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:13,500
Sure they can do it.
Those people will laugh at anything to 

1330
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,160
they're dumb as fuck to.
I think what the reality of this world 

1331
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,731
is that there's people that are.
Their brains don't work so good,

1332
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:26,220
they just don't,
and there's not a goddamn thing you can 

1333
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:26,220
do about it.
It's not about education.

1334
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,060
It's not about how much information you 
give them.

1335
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,380
It's not about the environment they're 
in.

1336
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,250
They have nine volt brains.
No,

1337
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:37,260
I know.
And like the funniest to give the 

1338
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,301
audience.
The audience has never communally stood 

1339
00:58:39,301 --> 00:58:39,350
up to someone who was like,
that's hacky.

1340
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:44,540
Like the audience never says that.
It's always being judged by other 

1341
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:44,540
comments.
Say this is in general,

1342
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:45,180
like when there's a hacky comic on 
stage,

1343
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,220
usually he's destroying it depends on 
where you're at,

1344
00:58:48,221 --> 00:58:49,920
right?
I mean if you're in la or New York,

1345
00:58:49,921 --> 00:58:52,570
those guys could he beat and shit 
possibly.

1346
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:57,571
But forums like this where comics and 
people get to talk and like there's so 

1347
00:58:57,571 --> 00:59:02,131
much insight information out now.
I think it kind of weeds through that 

1348
00:59:02,131 --> 00:59:03,220
happened and now I think the audiences 
are a little smarter in some circles,

1349
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,940
but they have to be fans.
Like if you.

1350
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,580
Do you remember going to see comedy when
you first started to like go to open mic

1351
00:59:09,581 --> 00:59:14,581
nights.
See guys that you thought were really 

1352
00:59:14,581 --> 00:59:14,640
funny and then like a year later you 
fucking couldn't even be in the room and

1353
00:59:14,641 --> 00:59:15,640
they're on stage.
Oh,

1354
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,300
I mean the people I worshiped when I 
started,

1355
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:20,800
I was like,
just the way he kills,

1356
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:21,980
you know,
like I got

1357
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,980
to do a joke where I open up and say dj 
put that shit on one more time because 

1358
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,390
everyone had to have one of those.
I used to get down to the underwear on 

1359
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:33,881
stage,
used to get down to my underwear posing 

1360
00:59:33,881 --> 00:59:34,850
to the 2001 theme.
Oh God.

1361
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,510
And then one day no one left.
I didn't do ever again.

1362
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,030
I went to see this guy when I was in a.

1363
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,460
When I was in Boston before I did stand 
up,

1364
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:45,890
I went to see this,
a comedy at a play it again,

1365
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:50,891
Sam's.
It was like this movie house that had 

1366
00:59:50,891 --> 00:59:53,260
stand up in the basement and this guy 
did these like fake adlibs and I knew 

1367
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:58,961
they were fake while it's happening.
I didn't understand comedy be but he 

1368
00:59:58,961 --> 00:59:59,720
pointed to me and he goes,
and this guy is over here saying this,

1369
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:01,940
but I didn't say anything.
I don't remember what it was,

1370
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:03,440
but I remember like,
he's like,

1371
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:08,441
what?
I couldn't believe that he was 

1372
01:00:08,441 --> 01:00:09,510
pretending that there was some sort of a
weird interaction.

1373
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:14,360
We asked for the rest of the audience 
and so I realized that this guy was just

1374
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:17,060
bullshitting and this is kind of this 
fake dance.

1375
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:22,240
And then as I got to know him,
I kept seeing them over and over and 

1376
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:22,240
over again.
He was doing the same thing.

1377
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,290
Every time he would,
he would set this bit up,

1378
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:26,600
he would point to a guy in the audience 
and he's like this.

1379
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:28,490
He would say the same thing.
Like he never,

1380
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:32,600
he had his fake adlibs with the crowd.
There was no variation.

1381
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:35,260
So if you saw him more than once the act
was done like the,

1382
01:00:35,261 --> 01:00:35,690
the,
the,

1383
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:36,940
the veil had been lifted.

1384
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:42,040
It doesn't bring any joy to watch.
Like that level of shitty comedy like 

1385
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:42,040
happened.
No,

1386
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,680
it makes me sad.
It makes me laugh.

1387
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,840
So I,
I used to any show when it comes,

1388
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:50,900
I just can't believe nothing when you 
watch somebody either on television and 

1389
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:51,210
their first joke is,
now I know what you guys are thinking.

1390
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,280
Actually,
I had a guy open for me one time on the 

1391
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:58,280
road where,
uh,

1392
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,210
he had a joke.
I forget what it even was it about,

1393
01:01:00,211 --> 01:01:03,090
but whatever it was,
the crowd never laughed in the middle of

1394
01:01:03,091 --> 01:01:04,500
it.
And he goes,

1395
01:01:04,501 --> 01:01:07,320
uh,
so my family used to run a funeral home.

1396
01:01:07,321 --> 01:01:09,180
He goes,
now you guys laugh.

1397
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:11,550
But he goes into his job,
but no one,

1398
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:14,850
no one laughed at that.
But every time he goes,

1399
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:16,860
now you guys laugh.
But I had never.

1400
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,760
That's always funny.
The now,

1401
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:20,100
uh,
I know what you're thinking,

1402
01:01:20,101 --> 01:01:23,040
you see me and I'm like,
it happens a lot.

1403
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:26,100
People like it.
I feel you should never,

1404
01:01:26,101 --> 01:01:31,101
and a lot of us do,
but you should never get on television 

1405
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:31,101
with your first ever set,
you know,

1406
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:32,630
when you go on,
when you go on the road and me,

1407
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,450
you know,
as a,

1408
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,690
uh,
when I,

1409
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,510
when I go on the road and someone opens 
for me,

1410
01:01:36,511 --> 01:01:38,760
I'm generally getting somebody doing 
their first set.

1411
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:43,761
You remember that.
Like when every time he got on stage it 

1412
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:44,340
was the introduction.
So my name is Jay and I blah,

1413
01:01:44,341 --> 01:01:44,970
blah blah,
you know,

1414
01:01:44,971 --> 01:01:49,971
it's like first day girl comedy.
So I'm so and so and I'm a total slot 

1415
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:53,310
and I sex with my friends and it's just 
like that.

1416
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:55,400
But that first set makes it on tv a lot.
Now [inaudible],

1417
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:56,940
there's so many forums.
Yeah,

1418
01:01:56,941 --> 01:01:59,370
but that's just life.
You just kind of move on,

1419
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:04,450
just deal with it.
It's probably not good to have your 

1420
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:06,761
first set,
but if you've been doing standup for 10 

1421
01:02:06,761 --> 01:02:06,761
years or whatever it is,
when you get your first set on tv,

1422
01:02:06,761 --> 01:02:10,520
six years just fuckin accepted sucks 
except that it sucks and move on,

1423
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:11,630
you know,
and you won't know.

1424
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:16,631
It sucks until you see it.
You gotta watch it on TV like later in 

1425
01:02:16,631 --> 01:02:17,700
your career when you're better and you'd
go.

1426
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:18,690
But yeah,
I'm,

1427
01:02:18,691 --> 01:02:20,730
I'm,
I'm saying I'm surprised that the behind

1428
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:24,900
the scenes don't catch up to like,
like to see like there's no like,

1429
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:27,960
uh,
they don't take any cues from the actual

1430
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:29,910
community of comedy itself.
Do you know what I mean?

1431
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
They're like,
this guy's been doing comedy for five 

1432
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,101
months.
Like of course he should be on 

1433
01:02:37,101 --> 01:02:37,101
letterman.
You know what I mean?

1434
01:02:37,101 --> 01:02:39,880
The behind the scenes,
people know they're always looking for 

1435
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,050
someone to come along to prodigy.
That figures it out after four months.

1436
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:45,170
So weird.
But I don't know if they do that person 

1437
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:45,170
any favors though.
They definitely don't.

1438
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:48,831
They don't give a fuck though.
All they care about is what can they 

1439
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:48,831
sell.
Just like the reality show,

1440
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,560
as I,
if you've noticed,

1441
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:51,360
if you've watched the video of moved 
into a new chair,

1442
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:54,030
ladies and gentlemen,
I don't know if this one's going to make

1443
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:59,031
it and I don't know,
but the other thing is better than no 

1444
01:02:59,031 --> 01:02:59,031
back things better.

1445
01:02:59,031 --> 01:02:59,031
Um,
but it's,

1446
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:00,740
you know,
they just sell you,

1447
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:01,700
you know?
Sure.

1448
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,710
If they can sell the hook is you 
Olympians in Stanford,

1449
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:06,660
five months,
they're not going to protect you.

1450
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:09,570
They're not going to go up that big Jay.
He's got potential for the future.

1451
01:03:09,571 --> 01:03:12,750
Let's not put it.
Five month old comedy set.

1452
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:17,810
No the fuck you get on TV.
Who gives a shit sink or swim as many 

1453
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:18,090
more people they have to pay attention 
to.

1454
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,200
They don't give a fuck.
I'll look.

1455
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,900
I'm sure the fucking.
What's it?

1456
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:26,901
The hunger games.
People were pretty thrilled that j dot 

1457
01:03:26,901 --> 01:03:26,901
snatches out there.
That's huge for them.

1458
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:32,120
Just drew a whole new audience to that 
show because I don't know how those two 

1459
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,181
are connected,
but we're talking about someone being 

1460
01:03:35,181 --> 01:03:35,220
hacked now.
Someone who was talking about.

1461
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:37,520
I thought you were saying about selling 
things like the company.

1462
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,030
I was saying that companies that don't 
care,

1463
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:42,630
like the movie companies don't care that
she gets like exposed.

1464
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,400
You know what I mean?
Is it does give them a good job.

1465
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:46,580
They don't protect her.
I'm saying they don't.

1466
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,630
They don't come out.
They would have protected her.

1467
01:03:48,631 --> 01:03:51,720
I'm sure they probably wouldn't have let
it be released but it.

1468
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,700
But it's to their benefit now that it 
is.

1469
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,180
I kind of guess so.
Yeah.

1470
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:59,100
But it's a different thing than I had in
my mind.

1471
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:00,360
I was like,
did it have nothing to do with it?

1472
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:00,800
I'm like,
no.

1473
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:04,290
There was a connection in my mind.
There was something there I guess.

1474
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:09,560
I guess I've only seen the first one now
I want to watch more after seeing her 

1475
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,350
naked.
Right.

1476
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,660
Which is good for the company.
So the movie company,

1477
01:04:12,661 --> 01:04:14,280
even though it's like they pay her and 
she's like,

1478
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:15,750
you know,
she has a relationship with them.

1479
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:19,260
They don't give a fuck if something to 
her detriment builds up their movie.

1480
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,390
Yeah,
I could see that probably.

1481
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,800
Yeah,
probably after it's over there,

1482
01:04:22,801 --> 01:04:25,530
like they probably would have protected 
her from getting out.

1483
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:28,500
But once it's out like hey look,
in the long run we're going to do bro.

1484
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:32,550
She looks great.
Sat around the office and yeah,

1485
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:37,820
it's true being the only way you're ever
going to get protected as a comic 

1486
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:40,620
because if you have a manager and the 
manager will say,

1487
01:04:40,621 --> 01:04:41,370
listen Jane,
you know,

1488
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,110
let's keep hitting the clubs and you 
know,

1489
01:04:43,111 --> 01:04:44,550
wait a year,
wait,

1490
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,710
wait a couple of years,
we'll just work.

1491
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:49,830
Where's that manager?
Jeff Salzman.

1492
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:50,880
Yeah,
my guy.

1493
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,460
Yeah,
it's hard.

1494
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:57,490
You've got to develop comedians.
Like you got to treat them as like a 

1495
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:01,671
longterm project.
You can't like move people into a house 

1496
01:05:01,671 --> 01:05:01,671
before you can put a roof on it and he 
can't pretend it's done.

1497
01:05:01,671 --> 01:05:06,561
What's not done.
And when you see a young guy that's got 

1498
01:05:06,561 --> 01:05:07,680
potential,
I mean everybody that we've ever met,

1499
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:10,500
they go through periods like you were 
talking about your black comedy period.

1500
01:05:10,501 --> 01:05:11,340
Sure.
You know,

1501
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:16,700
people go through these weird phases 
where they're trying to find themselves 

1502
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:16,700
as,
I hate to use the word,

1503
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,130
but artists find myself as an artist

1504
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,640
man.
And uh,

1505
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:25,440
but the thing is if there's a video of 
you have five months in and then it's 

1506
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,980
terrible,
but there's a way better video two years

1507
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:27,700
later.
Well,

1508
01:05:27,701 --> 01:05:29,590
if someone watches both,
they go out.

1509
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,760
Jay got better,
you know,

1510
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:31,950
it's just,
there's nothing wrong.

1511
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,160
Oh,
I did bet.

1512
01:05:34,161 --> 01:05:37,070
Comicview thrice three times.
Really?

1513
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,020
Yeah.
So I mean,

1514
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:43,021
like who was hosting the first one ever 
was lester barry who was a black circuit

1515
01:05:45,281 --> 01:05:48,250
comic for the very religious.
Nice.

1516
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:51,130
The second time I did it was Arnez J in 
Miami.

1517
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:54,730
And the third time third time was funny 
because I said by this point I go,

1518
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:57,380
I'm not doing comic view ever again.
Like I just,

1519
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:58,960
I've written that one off,
I'm not doing it.

1520
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,090
It's always an awkward situation when I 
go there too.

1521
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:03,520
Why?
Because I'm the only white guy,

1522
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:08,610
the production is white and they put 
some weird responsibility on me to be 

1523
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:12,541
like the den mother of the comics,
so I've like smoked cigarettes and I'd 

1524
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:17,461
go outside,
I'm going to go outside and smoke a 

1525
01:06:17,461 --> 01:06:17,461
cigarette.

1526
01:06:17,461 --> 01:06:17,461
She goes,
okay,

1527
01:06:17,461 --> 01:06:19,381
wait a second.
He was everyone Jay's going to smoke if 

1528
01:06:19,381 --> 01:06:21,781
you want to smoke,
go out now with him and everyone's got 

1529
01:06:21,781 --> 01:06:24,851
to be back in here in 15 minutes.
And then she tried to get me all of 

1530
01:06:24,851 --> 01:06:25,990
their food tickets so I'd be responsible
for them.

1531
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:27,820
It was very bizarre.
Just because you're white.

1532
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:29,320
Yeah,
I mean I assume so.

1533
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,020
That said,
a lot of the black comics will do things

1534
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:33,550
like I'm going to go out and smoke and 
then go like,

1535
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:38,551
you know,
fuck a chick for five hours trying to 

1536
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:38,551
cut back 15 minutes before the show 
starts.

1537
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:39,510
So that did happen.
Well,

1538
01:06:39,511 --> 01:06:44,511
what they want you to do is just hang 
out all day waiting for the show to 

1539
01:06:44,511 --> 01:06:44,511
start.
Oh,

1540
01:06:44,511 --> 01:06:45,120
they put you there at nine in the 
morning until night.

1541
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:46,690
I went on at midnight.
What?

1542
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:51,930
Yeah,
because they just don't want this 

1543
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:51,930
wrangle.
Everybody acts.

1544
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:51,930
They don't believe anyone.

1545
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:54,820
No,
no belief.

1546
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:59,821
They're going to stay there.
They've done entire shows about how 

1547
01:06:59,821 --> 01:07:02,641
happy they are.
Like they'll do a show where the same 

1548
01:07:02,641 --> 01:07:02,641
joke gets repeated by different 
comedians.

1549
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,560
Well yeah,
and so I went and did it.

1550
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:09,130
Kevin Hart ended up hosting I think one 
of the last ever seasons,

1551
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:14,460
but it was called one mic stand and 
where something like that I think is 

1552
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:14,460
what it's called,
one mic stand,

1553
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:18,400
but it wasn't called comic view and 
Kevin called me and asked me if I wanted

1554
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,710
to do it or if I would do it.
And I said,

1555
01:07:20,711 --> 01:07:25,711
yeah,
but I don't want to do comic view 

1556
01:07:25,711 --> 01:07:25,711
anymore.
He goes,

1557
01:07:25,711 --> 01:07:25,711
it's not comic view.
It's different.

1558
01:07:25,711 --> 01:07:26,410
They're flying people out now.
They're doing it all right.

1559
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,300
And set it up good.
And it was a.

1560
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:30,400
When I signed the contract,
gets comic presents,

1561
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:35,460
one mic stand.
They gave us a big speech before we 

1562
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:37,050
taped anything and the guy was like,
we're changing comic fuel.

1563
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:42,050
It's going to be different.
And the guys specifically said no more 

1564
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:45,571
stool humping and dj hit it and pulling 
out fake teeth.

1565
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,140
And uh,
I mean we weren't three comics in before

1566
01:07:50,141 --> 01:07:52,300
the guy was wearing fake teeth and 
fucking a stool.

1567
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:57,820
I mean not even by the way,
when he's giving this speech to it,

1568
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:01,480
these same guys who were getting ready 
to fuck stools and put in fake teeth are

1569
01:08:01,481 --> 01:08:02,140
doing like,
you know,

1570
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:07,141
like staring at him,
give the speech and like nodding their 

1571
01:08:07,141 --> 01:08:07,141
heads like a Pachino speech in any given
Sunday.

1572
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,280
It's like an emotional,
powerful speech.

1573
01:08:09,281 --> 01:08:12,640
How we're changing comic view now.
And then they went and they were like,

1574
01:08:12,641 --> 01:08:17,641
yeah,
let's go out there and show the world 

1575
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:17,641
something.
And then two minutes later you're like,

1576
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:21,221
Dj put that Shit back on that bitch with
fake teeth to this one was black 

1577
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:27,070
surrogates made for some great,
great,

1578
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:27,740
great stories.

1579
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,840
I had a guy one time,
this is true story.

1580
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,950
Kevin used to host a club in Atlantic 
city,

1581
01:08:33,951 --> 01:08:36,650
Kevin Hart called sweet cheeks,
sweet,

1582
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:39,080
violent.
It was like a pimps and players ball.

1583
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:44,380
No bullshit.
It was like everyone was wearing zoot 

1584
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:46,271
suits and shit.
And bringing like three chicks a piece 

1585
01:08:46,271 --> 01:08:48,821
and they were all dressed up fancy,
but they interrupt dancing to do a 

1586
01:08:48,821 --> 01:08:52,550
comedy show in the middle of the fucking
night.

1587
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,260
Like two,
3:00

1588
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:56,030
in the morning.
Yeah.

1589
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:58,400
And I,
I was hosting at one time for Kev,

1590
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,780
you couldn't do it.
And they hated me.

1591
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:05,200
They absolutely didn't like me at all 
and I was going to bring the comic on 

1592
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:05,870
stage and I go like,
all right,

1593
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:07,550
but I'm gonna bring up next to go what's
your name?

1594
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:08,940
And he goes,
uh,

1595
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,000
ignorant Nigga.
And I was like,

1596
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,430
dude,
don't make me say that please.

1597
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,830
And he's like,
that's my name as my stage name.

1598
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:21,390
And I kept,
I begged him to let me call him by his 

1599
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:21,390
regular name and I go,
it's not going to go good if I said.

1600
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:21,500
He goes,
it's fine man.

1601
01:09:21,501 --> 01:09:22,610
I'll explain.
It's my name.

1602
01:09:22,611 --> 01:09:23,930
You know,
he set you up?

1603
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,130
Yeah.
When are you going on stage?

1604
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:30,131
He goes,
you're going to let that white boy call 

1605
01:09:30,131 --> 01:09:30,131
me.
And I left.

1606
01:09:30,131 --> 01:09:30,131
I just left the show.
I drove off.

1607
01:09:30,131 --> 01:09:30,720
Yeah.
That was like,

1608
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:36,370
it was a dangerous place.
The bouncer outside was a bounty hunter 

1609
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:37,670
also,
so he would run ids.

1610
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:42,710
Everybody that walked in,
he'd get five people in light on 

1611
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:42,710
warrants.
Wow,

1612
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:47,220
that's crazy.
He was a bounty hunter and an ID 

1613
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:47,220
checker.
Yeah.

1614
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,200
That's like fishing in a fucking 
swimming pool.

1615
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:53,510
That's so not fair.
That seems like a deer in a stock pond.

1616
01:09:55,060 --> 01:10:00,060
You know what I mean?
It just seems really fucked up a night 

1617
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,990
club and it was just like an a pimps and
players nightclub.

1618
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:08,260
Yeah,
they threw the chicken wings at me one 

1619
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:08,260
time.
Wow.

1620
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:08,260
It was a.
and I think I.

1621
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:12,830
Yeah,
I think I was doing that joke where I 

1622
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:14,021
was getting down to my underwear.
Who the fuck wants them to do comedy at 

1623
01:10:14,021 --> 01:10:18,011
2:00
in the morning and a place where they 

1624
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:18,011
have dancing.
They do.

1625
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:20,981
I used to do these ski trips shows that 
were like black ski trips and black 

1626
01:10:20,981 --> 01:10:22,910
people don't even ski at all.
They don't.

1627
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:27,911
They go and they,
they took a bus thing to go to this 

1628
01:10:27,911 --> 01:10:29,300
hotel and they'd all just like,
fuck each other fucking drink,

1629
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:33,440
you know,
green alcohol and a green alcohol,

1630
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:37,130
just like Tang arrays and the drinks 
were always great.

1631
01:10:37,131 --> 01:10:41,180
Like thug passion streaks.

1632
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:46,330
Yeah.
And I go up there and open someone's 

1633
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:48,080
already headline for these black ski 
trips and they just fucking hated it.

1634
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,000
Wanted no parts of the comedy show.
I never understand why they force comedy

1635
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:55,160
into places where it doesn't need to be 
at all.

1636
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:56,810
Well,
people make money,

1637
01:10:56,930 --> 01:11:01,930
you know,
I'm sure Kevin Hart got a nice piece by 

1638
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:01,930
navy,
I mean was,

1639
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:03,410
he was very young.
We were like brand new in comedy,

1640
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,630
but I mean if somebody offers it and 
you're like,

1641
01:11:05,631 --> 01:11:06,560
yeah,
we can do a show there.

1642
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:07,760
Fuck it.
Yeah.

1643
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:10,640
I mean the bar shows that New York 
that's become such a thing.

1644
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:14,560
Bar shows are shows and I go to them 
with this,

1645
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:16,110
you know,
this expectation.

1646
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:21,111
What blows my mind about I think bar 
shows or a cool thing to have as far as 

1647
01:11:21,111 --> 01:11:21,111
like open mics.
Basically.

1648
01:11:21,111 --> 01:11:22,500
Little produce shows you can get people 
on,

1649
01:11:22,501 --> 01:11:24,900
but like I'll hear my friends,
you know,

1650
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:26,670
or younger comics who I know and I'll be
like,

1651
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:27,570
where are you at tonight?

1652
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:29,220
And he goes,
so and so I go,

1653
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:30,690
oh,
well do this other thing with me.

1654
01:11:30,691 --> 01:11:32,610
Like don't go to that bullshit bar show.
And it's like,

1655
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:35,590
I've been booked this for three months.
Like whoa.

1656
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:36,330
Yeah,
they call you.

1657
01:11:36,331 --> 01:11:40,320
It's like you want to do my bar show 
it's batch when it sees bet 25 people,

1658
01:11:40,321 --> 01:11:41,730
uh,
you know,

1659
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,760
he's getting a drink ticket or half 
price off drinks and it's on Tuesday at 

1660
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:46,760
9:00
PM,

1661
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,920
somewhere in nowhere fucking Brooklyn.
And then it's like,

1662
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:50,860
oh yeah,
I guess I can do it.

1663
01:11:50,861 --> 01:11:51,340
And it's like,
you know,

1664
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:52,490
okay.
So I'm looking at like,

1665
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:54,090
I have my book open here,
like December,

1666
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:59,330
like May,
like they really booked this things far 

1667
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:01,701
out.
Is that just because there's so many 

1668
01:12:01,701 --> 01:12:01,701
comics in New York?
It is.

1669
01:12:01,701 --> 01:12:03,020
I think it's a lot of it becomes like 
people just getting their friends on his

1670
01:12:03,021 --> 01:12:08,021
ship probably find the gas because he's,
a lot of these shows have become like 

1671
01:12:08,021 --> 01:12:08,021
legit to some degree.

1672
01:12:08,021 --> 01:12:10,190
Well if it's a good show,
well run.

1673
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:12,440
It's very valuable to comedians.
Sure.

1674
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:13,340
I gave you,
you know,

1675
01:12:13,341 --> 01:12:15,650
you go to Wednesday night comedy juice,
the Improv,

1676
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,260
so he's going to be packed.
It's a great place to work out material.

1677
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,420
Like that becomes the.
Yeah.

1678
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:21,610
But you know what I'm saying?
Sure.

1679
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:26,830
So shows like that become valuable and 
then little side gigs like was a place 

1680
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:27,640
you were talking about three clubs and 
what does it mean?

1681
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:28,340
Clubs?
Yeah,

1682
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,150
I mean like all these kinds of bars 
says.

1683
01:12:31,151 --> 01:12:33,880
But the like with the old red rocks has 
one now that's,

1684
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:38,890
that's like in the corner.
But the problem is New York is like a 

1685
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:40,870
billion times more bar shows in la.
So like all the local comics in La,

1686
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:44,020
they will get that one shitty bar show,
but it's like,

1687
01:12:44,021 --> 01:12:46,230
yeah,
it's like a month away when they get it.

1688
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,750
Like how many rooms are there all told 
in New York?

1689
01:12:49,751 --> 01:12:51,310
If you had to guests,
you live in Manhattan.

1690
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:56,490
Yeah.
How many rooms do you think comedy 

1691
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:56,490
standup rooms or in the,

1692
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:57,080
in the actual clubs,
we could run through them.

1693
01:12:57,081 --> 01:13:00,350
Really a stay at New York comic strip 
seller,

1694
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:01,610
seller,
Gotham,

1695
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:03,560
Gotham,

1696
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,260
Um,
Caroline's Caroline's.

1697
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,900
Then there's a Greenwich Village Comedy 
Club,

1698
01:13:08,901 --> 01:13:10,820
New York Comedy Club,
Broadway Comedy Club,

1699
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,110
New York comedy clubs.
Still around.

1700
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,440
Just bought my new guy danger fields who
are 10.

1701
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:21,190
Um,
there is a lol comedy club in Times 

1702
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,350
Square.

1703
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:23,920
Lol.
Yeah.

1704
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,800
And then there's like places there's 
like,

1705
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:31,220
and then like some room show there every
week times square,

1706
01:13:31,701 --> 01:13:33,320

1707
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:37,790
lol.
I'm good dude.

1708
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,160
I'm not fucking with them.
Uh,

1709
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,350
11 were at 11 and then there's.
And then there's like,

1710
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:44,210
oh,
Eastville comedy club 13.

1711
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:46,190
I think.
Yeah,

1712
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:47,840
I mean it's really,
it's pretty nuts.

1713
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:49,850
Yeah.
So that's the major clubs.

1714
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,700
It's really awesome.
Did we say God didn't take them?

1715
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:53,780
So that's,
uh,

1716
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,550
that's the major clubs.
Yeah.

1717
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:58,160
And then on top of that you got how many
bar shows?

1718
01:13:58,161 --> 01:13:58,280
Yeah.
Do you

1719
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:01,500
think in the city or around the.
Even the boroughs in the city?

1720
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,480
Just in the city,
just in Manhattan,

1721
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:08,690
I mean there's got to be fucking 10 a 
night fight against at least.

1722
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,070
At least.
That's crazy.

1723
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,190
It's also like the people

1724
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,020
that live in New York and go to New 
York,

1725
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:19,021
there are more into like plays and live 
performances that I think like the west 

1726
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:19,021
coast is.

1727
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:23,970
Well,
if you're a young person or any person 

1728
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:25,210
who's got free time at night and you're 
looking for some entertainment,

1729
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:27,270
it's one of the best place in the world 
and go,

1730
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:32,280
you can go to the seller.
If you can go to caroline's and you can 

1731
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:32,280
see live comedy in New York every night 
of the week.

1732
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,970
You can see killers.
You could see,

1733
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:38,971
you know,
a pto and ck and all these different 

1734
01:14:38,971 --> 01:14:38,971
people show up at clubs.
I mean,

1735
01:14:38,971 --> 01:14:42,400
it's one of the best places in the world
to go out and see live comedy.

1736
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:43,360
Oh,
New York.

1737
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:44,410
Yeah.
Fantastic.

1738
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:46,570
Just to go out.
I mean,

1739
01:14:46,571 --> 01:14:51,571
that's what people,
if they've never been in New York 

1740
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:51,571
before,
they're like,

1741
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:51,571
there's so many restaurants and 
somebody.

1742
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:53,950
This is somebody that it's fucking mad 
scene.

1743
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:59,130
I drove by the laugh factory last night 
out here and it was like the line was 

1744
01:14:59,130 --> 01:14:59,130
like wrapped around the building.

1745
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:02,650
That's Jamie doesn't let people in.
He wants that line to be wrapped around 

1746
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:02,650
the building.
He doesn't just like let people in.

1747
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:05,610
He makes you stay outside so it looks 
like a line out there.

1748
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:10,650
We're signing up for tomorrow.
Those a lot of them was like the open 

1749
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:12,010
mic nights,
like they have to open mic nights.

1750
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:14,890
They make people sit out there from 9:00
in the morning,

1751
01:15:14,891 --> 01:15:18,580
whatever the fuck the sign up time is 
and they have to wait in line until they

1752
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,680
get picked and then they go on next 
week.

1753
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:25,770
They don't even go on that week.
The wait in line all day and they go on 

1754
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:27,370
the next week.
Why exactly.

1755
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:32,900
We've been.
We've been rallying against this next 

1756
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:32,900
time I a control.
Exactly.

1757
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:37,470
It's a ridiculous idea that he has that 
in doing so he makes the club more 

1758
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:38,500
special because it was always a big 
line.

1759
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:39,340
It's tough to get in,

1760
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:42,400
put your thumb on people that could 
eventually like,

1761
01:15:42,401 --> 01:15:43,180
you know,
like say like,

1762
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:48,181
this is my home,
this is the club that showed me the 

1763
01:15:48,181 --> 01:15:48,181
love.
Like why?

1764
01:15:48,181 --> 01:15:48,181
Yeah,

1765
01:15:48,181 --> 01:15:49,980
I never got that.
That same evil shit that makes producers

1766
01:15:49,981 --> 01:15:53,520
put someone on a reality show and then 
try to own everything about them for the

1767
01:15:53,521 --> 01:15:55,470
next 10 years or whatever the fuck it 
is.

1768
01:15:55,471 --> 01:16:00,471
It's the same thing.
It's like greedy thing that people do 

1769
01:16:00,471 --> 01:16:00,471
out here,
this weird,

1770
01:16:00,471 --> 01:16:03,180
creepy fucking behavior where the people
that are coming up,

1771
01:16:03,181 --> 01:16:08,181
I'm not respected as potential equals 
and if they do somehow another make it 

1772
01:16:08,181 --> 01:16:09,630
through.
It's never through their own merit.

1773
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:13,020
It's because of the good nature and 
your,

1774
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:14,880
you know,
your generosity.

1775
01:16:14,881 --> 01:16:19,860
That's led them to this position of 
being a good a showbiz person.

1776
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:25,240
I find it weird with any comedy club 
that doesn't have comics hanging out at 

1777
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:29,171
it and like they want people to hang out
like comp comedians to hang out like 

1778
01:16:29,171 --> 01:16:30,320
that place.
The laugh factory.

1779
01:16:30,321 --> 01:16:32,180
That's the one thing that I've always 
heard is like,

1780
01:16:32,181 --> 01:16:33,880
no,
they don't let you hang out there.

1781
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:36,530
There's one getting to hang out there,
it's there.

1782
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:41,590
I know.
I think that that's only to a certain 

1783
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:41,590
group of,
you know,

1784
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:45,410
the big guys,
but the average comic is what that 

1785
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:45,410
always tells me that

1786
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:48,890
I did a club on the road one time where 
there was a young comics hanging out.

1787
01:16:48,891 --> 01:16:49,860
So I was like,
uh,

1788
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,890
I talked to them for a little while and 
I was like,

1789
01:16:51,891 --> 01:16:53,670
you know,
if you guys want to go on like,

1790
01:16:53,671 --> 01:16:55,910
you know,
you can put you guys on each one do like

1791
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:57,410
seven minutes or something,
go for it.

1792
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,950
And they told me and I confirmed with 
the club that they go,

1793
01:17:00,951 --> 01:17:05,951
Oh,
now the club doesn't do guest spots at 

1794
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:05,951
all.
Like at all.

1795
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:09,851
I got thought it's kind of up to the 
isn't up to like the headliner if he 

1796
01:17:09,851 --> 01:17:09,851
like,
doesn't care,

1797
01:17:09,851 --> 01:17:10,090
like it was fine.
They go now that's

1798
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,800
just like our policy don't do it.
I go and I told him when I talked to the

1799
01:17:12,801 --> 01:17:13,640
manager guy,
I was like,

1800
01:17:13,641 --> 01:17:16,880
why would you discourage comics from 
hanging out?

1801
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:17,780
It's very like,
you know what I mean?

1802
01:17:17,781 --> 01:17:19,670
It doesn't make,
it's not a friendly environment.

1803
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,010
Well Wendy Curtis,
you know,

1804
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:24,050
it's kind of things you work those 
shitty open mic show.

1805
01:17:24,051 --> 01:17:29,051
So eventually maybe they'll give you a 
shot at like hosting a weekend or you 

1806
01:17:29,051 --> 01:17:29,720
know,
doing something like that guest spots.

1807
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,730
Do you know Wendy from comedy works in 
Denver?

1808
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,510
I know who she is.
Yeah.

1809
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:33,770
She,
uh,

1810
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,450
she had a great way of describing it.
She goes,

1811
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:40,660
why would you sell widgets and not have 
like a widget development team?

1812
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:47,110
Like why wouldn't you,
if you want to sell other people's 

1813
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:47,110
widgets,
you can make your own inhouse widgets.

1814
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:49,280
Like what are you doing when you're 
running a comedy club?

1815
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:51,960
You're not develop any local talent.
You don't develop any of it.

1816
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:57,080
Like it's one of the things like they 
were moving improv's into town and she 

1817
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,711
was saying like,
what are you guys going to do for like 

1818
01:17:59,711 --> 01:17:59,711
developing local talent?
And they're like,

1819
01:17:59,711 --> 01:17:59,711
nothing.
She was like,

1820
01:17:59,711 --> 01:18:01,160
what?
Like that's alien.

1821
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:06,190
Like she's developed a bunch of 
comedians out of that club and she has 

1822
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:08,480
like a whole system of taking people 
from MCS to relax to headliners.

1823
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:13,490
Like it's really well thought out,
really like conscientious system of 

1824
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,060
helping these artists,
you know,

1825
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:23,090
sometimes they have their babies,
but when people come to New York yet 

1826
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:23,090
it's always a two coin flip.
If someone's like what city?

1827
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:24,500
You're from Miami.
Like,

1828
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:25,610
oh,
what was your home club like?

1829
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,120
Oh,
the owner.

1830
01:18:26,121 --> 01:18:28,250
There was a piece of shit.
Treat me like an asshole.

1831
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,860
Would you say about babies?
Some of them are babies,

1832
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,000
no.

1833
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,960
What'd you say?
Should I say babies?

1834
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:39,710
But I don't know.
Because you were saying that people 

1835
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:42,491
complain about the sale when someone 
comes to the to like move to New York 

1836
01:18:42,491 --> 01:18:43,700
from their home club,
you know,

1837
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:45,020
where they started.
It's a coin flip.

1838
01:18:45,021 --> 01:18:47,500
Whether they're going to say it was a 
great experience.

1839
01:18:47,501 --> 01:18:48,860
So you know,
they're very supportive of them.

1840
01:18:48,861 --> 01:18:53,861
They get behind some people,
the local clubs and then some they just 

1841
01:18:53,861 --> 01:18:53,861
like,
there's such shitty people,

1842
01:18:53,861 --> 01:18:56,390
but I never understand being shitty to 
like local town.

1843
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:58,010
This is crazy.
People in clubs,

1844
01:18:58,070 --> 01:19:00,380
you know,
crazy people on dance clubs,

1845
01:19:00,381 --> 01:19:03,380
crazy people tends to be a certain 
personality type here.

1846
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:05,810
You've got to be a hardcore motherfucker
to own a bar,

1847
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:10,930
you know,
and to own a comedy club and just want 

1848
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:12,731
to deal with comedians all the time.
You got to be either someone who loves 

1849
01:19:12,731 --> 01:19:12,731
comedy or an insane person.

1850
01:19:12,731 --> 01:19:13,810
Do you get frustrated when,
uh,

1851
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:16,190
when people that are around comedy 
enough,

1852
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:18,230
even if it doesn't make sense in their 
life,

1853
01:19:18,231 --> 01:19:23,231
they're like,
I'm going to try and they started doing 

1854
01:19:23,231 --> 01:19:23,231
open mics or do you like,
go for it?

1855
01:19:23,231 --> 01:19:23,231
What do you mean?
Do you get like,

1856
01:19:23,231 --> 01:19:28,220
I know this club owners in New York,
even that just fucking start doing 

1857
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:29,210
comedy after owning the club for like 
three years,

1858
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:30,470
where like,
I'm doing it,

1859
01:19:30,471 --> 01:19:32,090
I'm going to give it a shot.
But who knows,

1860
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:37,120
maybe there'll be good.
They hired bookers and the booker start 

1861
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:37,120
trying to do Qa.
It's like very weird.

1862
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:37,640
Well,
eleanor,

1863
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,760
eleanor Kerrigan,
she was a waitress at the comedy store 

1864
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,971
forever.
I knew her as a waitress for more than 

1865
01:19:45,971 --> 01:19:46,040
10 years now.
She's a real professional comic.

1866
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:51,041
She started like many,
many years in because she had no around 

1867
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:52,010
comedy.
No thought about doing it ever?

1868
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:52,850
Nope.
Nope.

1869
01:19:52,851 --> 01:19:54,040
Just got,
get another job.

1870
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:55,850
One day actress.
She was an actress.

1871
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,710
She did a lot of acting.
She was in wrestling.

1872
01:19:57,711 --> 01:20:02,711
She did some pro wrestling and then 
somewhere along the line she just 

1873
01:20:02,711 --> 01:20:02,711
decided,
fuck it,

1874
01:20:02,711 --> 01:20:04,820
I'm going to go on stage.
And she started doing standup.

1875
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:07,710
Yeah,
I mean now she's a pro.

1876
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,160
She's

1877
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,390
funny.
I mean it's crazy.

1878
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:12,630
I mean she's smart so she understands 
like what's funny and what's not funny.

1879
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,130
She knows what's happening and what's 
not.

1880
01:20:14,131 --> 01:20:15,630
So she didn't fall in any pitfalls.

1881
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:18,300
Maybe I feel the ego stroke because I 
feel like when it's done,

1882
01:20:18,301 --> 01:20:20,230
like uh,
the current Metzker,

1883
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:25,580
you know,
Kurt Kurt's never had a girlfriend that 

1884
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:25,580
has eventually been like,
well,

1885
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:29,250
if this shit had never vocalized that,
but in my mind,

1886
01:20:29,251 --> 01:20:31,560
like if my chick was like,
I want to do comedy,

1887
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:32,320
I'm like,
what do you think?

1888
01:20:32,321 --> 01:20:34,950
It's like super simple.
You think it's that easy.

1889
01:20:34,951 --> 01:20:35,680
You just go with like,
you know what?

1890
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:40,690
I'm gonna do your stupid thing.
It looks a lot more fun than my stupid 

1891
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:40,690
thing.

1892
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:40,690
Well it's also when they're around 
comics,

1893
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:45,051
they see how fun it is and they see like
how comic think and then they start 

1894
01:20:45,051 --> 01:20:47,420
thinking like comics and same ridiculous
shit show if you're,

1895
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:52,430
if you're around chick like long enough,
like she'll start seeing how you pick 

1896
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:54,990
things apart and make sure like if 
you're around someone who's really funny

1897
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:56,010
at work,
you know,

1898
01:20:56,011 --> 01:20:59,880
and it's like I have this boss who is a 
private investigator.

1899
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:03,240
Dude was hilarious.
He was just instantly hilarious.

1900
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:08,450
Just would find things that were goofy 
about people and start and you would 

1901
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:12,471
just how with this guy.
And I learned a lot like being around 

1902
01:21:12,471 --> 01:21:12,471
him,
I started doing that too.

1903
01:21:12,471 --> 01:21:15,780
Like you start seeing how he would find 
these patterns.

1904
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:21,020
Like he was very predatory,
like the patterns that we find that 

1905
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:23,691
we're fucked up and people and just 
attack those patterns and it's like 

1906
01:21:23,691 --> 01:21:23,820
teaching pick it up in relationships.

1907
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,330
People pick it up and friendships.
So you know,

1908
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:31,520
Kurt is a funny dude.
I get these checks were probably around 

1909
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:31,520
them and they were like,
Yo,

1910
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,850
what can fucking do this?
I see what's going on here.

1911
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:35,190
I guess you could make it look 
effortless maybe,

1912
01:21:35,191 --> 01:21:37,950
but like sort of also fun,
you know,

1913
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:39,200
I mean if fun.
Sure.

1914
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:42,600
Not Enjoying your life and you know,
not enjoying your job,

1915
01:21:42,601 --> 01:21:46,230
but you saw a guy like you having the 
time of his life cracking jokes,

1916
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:47,620
making shit.
God dammit.

1917
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:52,640
I think I could do that.
He looks he looks way better than a 

1918
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:56,331
regular job.
If you're a person that has a regular 

1919
01:21:56,331 --> 01:21:56,640
job and then someone like big Jay comes 
along,

1920
01:21:56,641 --> 01:21:58,440
you're hanging out with them and you 
watch and how he does it.

1921
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,540
Like this fucking guy's barely working 
here.

1922
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:05,570
Sure.
He's just laughing about shit and 

1923
01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:05,640
writing it down and then figuring out a 
way to say it on stage in a funny way.

1924
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:07,290
Fuck selling insurance.

1925
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:10,780
How many people did you grow up with,
um,

1926
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:14,060
before comedy that genuinely happy for 
you?

1927
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,820
Like really feel it.
What do you mean?

1928
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:22,300
Like do you have like friends from 
before comedy still and are like 

1929
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,780
genuinely happy for your success and 
like dig.

1930
01:22:23,781 --> 01:22:28,781
What you do is like if,
if I have one friend from growing up 

1931
01:22:28,781 --> 01:22:32,081
that I'm still friends with and it's 
because he's the only one of my friends 

1932
01:22:32,081 --> 01:22:32,150
that is doing what he wanted to do.
Also,

1933
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:36,020
you have to have that self security 
before you can like really cheap.

1934
01:22:36,021 --> 01:22:39,110
I'd go back to philly constantly,
barely any.

1935
01:22:39,111 --> 01:22:41,180
I mean I hung out with a lot of people 
on it growing up.

1936
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:43,460
No one comes out.
No one gives a shit.

1937
01:22:43,610 --> 01:22:45,880
Really.
None of them give a shit at all.

1938
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:50,890
Come to your shows.
You mean once in a while one of them 

1939
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:53,561
will pop up,
but a lot of times they'll say they're 

1940
01:22:53,561 --> 01:22:53,561
coming and they don't show up.
I mean,

1941
01:22:53,561 --> 01:22:56,051
I stopped giving a shit years ago.
I realized that all at one time because 

1942
01:22:56,051 --> 01:22:57,530
a bunch of them did come at once and 
afterwards they were like,

1943
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,510
good job man.
So we're all going over.

1944
01:22:59,511 --> 01:23:01,160
It's like dollar beer night at the so 
and so.

1945
01:23:01,161 --> 01:23:02,090
He went ahead and I'm like,
well,

1946
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:04,100
hang here for a few minutes to catch up 
and whatever.

1947
01:23:04,101 --> 01:23:06,030
They go,
the place kind of closes

1948
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:07,780
in like an hour and you're like,
alright,

1949
01:23:07,781 --> 01:23:08,740
bye.
Fuck faces.

1950
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:13,741
I guess like,
so what did you want them to spend more 

1951
01:23:13,741 --> 01:23:16,591
time having the Dodo vary by having seen
these people in a while and I was 

1952
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:19,950
genuinely curious about what's going on 
with them but you didn't want to go to 

1953
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:19,950
their spot,
but I just also,

1954
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:21,310
they were very dismissive of the whole 
thing,

1955
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:23,290
like thanks dude.
Pretty good job.

1956
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:24,430
It's just seemed to.
Didn't seem very.

1957
01:23:24,431 --> 01:23:26,710
Like if they would've been like,
wow dude,

1958
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,640
this is a pretty extraordinary thing 
you're doing at any point.

1959
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,230
I'm not saying they had to say those 
words,

1960
01:23:32,231 --> 01:23:35,110
but they showed that at all.
It makes them have to face the fact that

1961
01:23:35,111 --> 01:23:36,220
like,
you know,

1962
01:23:36,221 --> 01:23:39,070
he said he was going to be a pilot but 
he's working at a fucking gas station.

1963
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:44,100
Do you attribute it to jealousy or 
disinterest or what do you attribute it 

1964
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:44,100
to?

1965
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:46,570
It might be a little bit of both.
Who knows,

1966
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:48,550
but I know when I first started doing it
again,

1967
01:23:48,551 --> 01:23:51,310
like you said,
the way you did taekwondo,

1968
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:54,550
it's a heavy commitment,
especially because I started going after

1969
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:56,290
the first year of just doing it in 
Philly,

1970
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,800
Keith Robinson grabbed me,
Kurt Metzger and Kevin Hart and started 

1971
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,501
taking us up to New York and I did that.
I started not being able to do all the 

1972
01:24:04,501 --> 01:24:05,230
bullshit with my friends that we were 
doing.

1973
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:07,120
I wasn't part of like dollar beer night 
anymore,

1974
01:24:07,121 --> 01:24:09,160
you know what I mean?
Or any of that shit.

1975
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,730
So and,
but when I would come back and be like,

1976
01:24:12,731 --> 01:24:14,170
hey guys,
I'm doing this cool thing,

1977
01:24:14,171 --> 01:24:15,250
like,
come check this out.

1978
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:16,390
They were just like,
Eh,

1979
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:18,820
I don't care.
You know what I'm saying?

1980
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:19,840
Oh No,
I'm going to go do this,

1981
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:23,630
this neat show in Atlantic city or 
whatever the case always went live.

1982
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:28,630
When you're growing up,
there's certain people that you grow up 

1983
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:30,781
with because they went to school with 
you and then with your friends and some 

1984
01:24:30,781 --> 01:24:33,451
folks evolve and develop and change and 
grow and some people stagnate and 

1985
01:24:33,521 --> 01:24:36,190
actually develop problems for themselves
to distract themselves.

1986
01:24:36,191 --> 01:24:40,600
Like I grew up at some kids that were 
really good friends and then they became

1987
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:42,400
like,
one of them became a pill head.

1988
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,770
Like he's gone.
Like I don't talk to me more.

1989
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,810
If he called me,
I wouldn't call them back.

1990
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:47,980
You know,
you could probably get ahold of me,

1991
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:50,950
but he's too fucked up.
It's too fucked up.

1992
01:24:50,951 --> 01:24:55,951
I know his family.
I know all the disasters he's been 

1993
01:24:55,951 --> 01:24:58,651
through.
Just said I'm not interested in 

1994
01:24:58,651 --> 01:25:00,211
communicating,
so there's going to be people like that 

1995
01:25:00,211 --> 01:25:01,981
in your life.
Have you had to circumstantial 

1996
01:25:01,981 --> 01:25:01,981
friendships in comedy?
You know what I mean?

1997
01:25:01,981 --> 01:25:01,981
Like that.
Just like for you,

1998
01:25:01,981 --> 01:25:03,450
like you hung with someone for a little 
while and then like,

1999
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:06,160
I guess it really like the Rosa.
Did he live with me for awhile?

2000
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,820
When he first moved to New York,
when he moved out and we were tight,

2001
01:25:09,821 --> 01:25:14,821
we were together every day.
We drove in together to the city and 

2002
01:25:14,821 --> 01:25:18,150
from Queens and hung out all the time 
and I just don't describe being Joseph 

2003
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:18,160
friends.
Like he's my buddy for sure,

2004
01:25:18,161 --> 01:25:23,161
but I mean I'm probably the 30th person.
He would call him if he had good news 

2005
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:23,410
and his life.
You know what I mean?

2006
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:27,600
I'd probably hear it third hand first 
and we have no beef at all.

2007
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:32,650
When I see him,
we'd love to catch up and bullshit and 

2008
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:32,650
have a good time.
But you know what I'm saying?

2009
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:34,630
Like it turns out the issue just you 
need more from him.

2010
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,050
I'm just saying I need more from him.
I didn't even call me too.

2011
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,080
I think he's,
I think he's angry at my racism is also.

2012
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,270
Oh,
that Anthony Kumi a thing of the day was

2013
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:46,060
just so ridiculous.
He did our show and uh,

2014
01:25:46,061 --> 01:25:51,061
I heard you on the show.
Went on this long thing that was very 

2015
01:25:51,061 --> 01:25:53,200
jilted lover ish in a lot of ways about 
Kumi not calling.

2016
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:53,670
I'm like,
fine,

2017
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,920
it's just call him because I mean,
it also recognized that the guy's busy.

2018
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:02,100
No,
he defended all these other people but 

2019
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:02,100
he didn't defend me.
I'm like,

2020
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:02,100
oh,
come on man,

2021
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:04,100
cause he didn't like talk about you 
online.

2022
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,630
Like you're,
you're upset at them.

2023
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:10,910
And then there was this accusations of 
racism that they also didn't discuss.

2024
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:11,980
You know,
it's like,

2025
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,070
it was,
it was.

2026
01:26:13,071 --> 01:26:16,250
So all of it could have been handled 
better.

2027
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,820
Watch them go on the Anthony Show.
Yeah,

2028
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:22,160
I listened to it.
I mean look how that end.

2029
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,780
It should,
he should have never.

2030
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:28,340
You should never just written them off 
if a guy's your friend and he's involved

2031
01:26:28,341 --> 01:26:31,430
in some sort of a public crisis like 
Anthony was,

2032
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:36,930
you know,
first of all you have to recognize 

2033
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:38,570
there's a tremendous amount of stress 
involved in any sort of physical 

2034
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:41,651
altercation.
So don't expect people to behave 

2035
01:26:41,651 --> 01:26:41,651
rationally after someone punched him.
That's one.

2036
01:26:41,651 --> 01:26:43,880
And then two,
don't expect people to behave rationally

2037
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:48,881
after like gigantic groups of people 
start calling you a racist and saying,

2038
01:26:50,211 --> 01:26:55,211
you know what you're doing by writing 
all the is like essentially a hate 

2039
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:55,211
crime.

2040
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:59,500
He got fired from your job.
People Rally for you to get fired from 

2041
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,261
your job.
Other people rally for you to get 

2042
01:27:02,261 --> 01:27:03,761
rehired.
They want other people to boycott the 

2043
01:27:03,761 --> 01:27:04,020
show and cancel Sirius xm because of 
that.

2044
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:09,020
There was a lot stress going on.
The idea that he's ignoring Jojo tweets.

2045
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:10,510
Like fuck man.
Like what?

2046
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:13,460
What?
What version of the thing did you see?

2047
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:15,740
That job is a little bit selfish.
Sure.

2048
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:16,910
Yeah.
And I love Joe.

2049
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:21,940
He's a great guy.
That's what makes joe a really funny 

2050
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:22,850
comic,
is that he obsesses on things.

2051
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:28,000
He thinks about things until he finds 
out what's really funny about them and 

2052
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,461
then he figures out a way to do it 
onstage and figures out a way to cut it 

2053
01:27:30,461 --> 01:27:30,620
down to like a really funny joke.
He's a great comic.

2054
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:34,700
Shouldn't that same sort of curiosity,
sensibility,

2055
01:27:34,701 --> 01:27:35,690
obsession,
all those.

2056
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,060
The combination of things mixed together
in a stew.

2057
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:43,390
You know,
sometimes I could fuck with your 

2058
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:43,390
personal life,
you know,

2059
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:43,390
I think that's probably what happened 
there.

2060
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:43,800
You know,
that if,

2061
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:46,850
if it was a more rational circumstance 
for anthony,

2062
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:52,120
more rational response by Joe,
I think they could have had a 

2063
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:52,820
conversation about it and work through 
and I think they did kind of,

2064
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:55,310
I just don't understand how joe in any 
way,

2065
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:58,460
shape or form had a feeling where it was
like this effect to him in some way.

2066
01:27:58,670 --> 01:27:59,950
I don't know how people,
I mean I had,

2067
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:02,320
I had a,
I got tweets that were like a,

2068
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:04,930
you know,
cancel Sirius xm standby.

2069
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:07,080
And I just,
I just didn't.

2070
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:09,260
Not that I don't,
I,

2071
01:28:09,261 --> 01:28:09,920
I did.
Uh,

2072
01:28:09,921 --> 01:28:10,670
I did,
uh,

2073
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:12,970
Anthony [inaudible] podcast after that 
and talk to I,

2074
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,480
I,
I am,

2075
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:17,420
I understand why he did what he did.
I think he should've done the way he did

2076
01:28:17,421 --> 01:28:22,421
it.
I think there's a better way to handle 

2077
01:28:22,421 --> 01:28:22,421
it.
I think he does too.

2078
01:28:22,421 --> 01:28:22,421
Of course he does.
But I'm saying,

2079
01:28:22,421 --> 01:28:23,330
but I just think like,
I don't know,

2080
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:26,000
but it was just.
I agree that serious fired him.

2081
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:29,360
I wish he didn't get fired.
I wouldn't have done it myself,

2082
01:28:29,361 --> 01:28:31,640
but I'm not blown up when they said he's
fired,

2083
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:32,570
I wasn't like,
wait,

2084
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:37,600
what?
Like I completely understand that the 

2085
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:37,600
fire,
the shit though will rain down on them.

2086
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,900
It wasn't worth it to them.
So they fired him.

2087
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:39,740
Yeah,
I understand.

2088
01:28:39,741 --> 01:28:40,660
It's a business call,
but

2089
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:45,770
it is kind of a business call,
but it's also a business call to not do 

2090
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:45,780
it.
Like you have to decide like what,

2091
01:28:45,781 --> 01:28:48,140
what,
what helps your business giving that guy

2092
01:28:48,141 --> 01:28:53,141
an opportunity to express himself on the
show would have generated a tremendous 

2093
01:28:53,141 --> 01:28:53,141
amount of ratings,
you know?

2094
01:28:53,141 --> 01:28:55,700
Absolutely.
And I think if he'd done it eloquently,

2095
01:28:55,701 --> 01:29:00,701
which I'm sure he would've,
there would've been a tremendous amount 

2096
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:02,130
of support for keeping them on the show.
I think his,

2097
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:07,520
his argument in his assertion about the 
black community has always been there's 

2098
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,580
a violence problem in the black 
community.

2099
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,830
It's not that he's racist against all 
black people.

2100
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:16,040
What his point has always been is that 
there's a lot of folks that are not 

2101
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,210
willing to concede that there's a 
violence issue and he thinks there is an

2102
01:29:18,211 --> 01:29:19,170
issue,
you know,

2103
01:29:19,171 --> 01:29:24,171
where he and I don't know what his take 
on the social ramifications or the 

2104
01:29:24,171 --> 01:29:28,410
reasons for this racial issue or there's
violence issue in the black community.

2105
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:30,030
You know,
I think it's an economic thing.

2106
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:32,040
And what I've always pointed to is the 
Gypsies,

2107
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:37,400
Gypsies,
and in England and Ireland and who are 

2108
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:40,341
constantly getting involved in crime and
fighting and the bare knuckle 

2109
01:29:40,341 --> 01:29:41,420
motherfuckers and they're white.
You know,

2110
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:43,950
those type of people.
Um,

2111
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:49,260
the people that live in these 
economically challenging situations 

2112
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:50,430
where there's a lot of bad people around
them in a lot of crime and violence.

2113
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,440
That's the atmosphere you,
you live in.

2114
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:55,170
That's the soup you fucking were born 
into.

2115
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,150
And the shit's hard to deal with for 
everybody.

2116
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:03,200
And I think that what he did is also a 
function of that form of media.

2117
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:10,671
Like doing things in 140 characters.
You can express yourself very good in 

2118
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:10,860
140 characters.
And if you take,

2119
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:16,190
even if you take something from 
something you said in this podcast and 

2120
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:17,160
put it in 140 characters in quotes and 
put it on a tweet,

2121
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,750
it could make it look like a real piece 
of Shit,

2122
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:19,380
you know?

2123
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:21,350
Well,
but what it really was like,

2124
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,260
he just tweeted out what he should just 
said.

2125
01:30:24,261 --> 01:30:24,960
Well he,
you know,

2126
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,620
exact part,
it's a piece of plywood or no,

2127
01:30:27,621 --> 01:30:32,621
he should have set it on the radio.
But by then he could have gotten a way 

2128
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:38,261
to say it so eloquently.
I'm talking about in that moment of 

2129
01:30:38,261 --> 01:30:39,530
fury,
you need to call a friend who's going to

2130
01:30:39,531 --> 01:30:40,100
go,
I know,

2131
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:40,760
dude.
Right?

2132
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:45,850
I know you're so right.
And then 15 minutes later when you calm 

2133
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:45,850
down,
you go,

2134
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:45,930
of course I don't hit every black 
person.

2135
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:48,650
It's like he,
he vented and I said,

2136
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:53,700
and he's such a guy who's used to 
preaching to the choir and he forgot 

2137
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:54,850
that there's like regular people behind 
that choir that I'm going to be like,

2138
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,110
we're waiting to hear catch that.
Catch them like it's way easier.

2139
01:30:58,111 --> 01:30:58,160
Yeah.

2140
01:30:58,270 --> 01:31:00,610
Take your tweet and retweet it than it 
is to say,

2141
01:31:00,611 --> 01:31:01,240
hey,
you gotta,

2142
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:06,270
listen to Anthony on Sirius xm this 
morning when he was going off about how 

2143
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:08,590
there's a violence problem in the black 
community and all the crazy shit that he

2144
01:31:08,591 --> 01:31:10,600
screamed and yelled about.
That's one thing,

2145
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:14,140
but to someone to just take those tweets
and retweet them or take them to cut and

2146
01:31:14,141 --> 01:31:17,560
paste them and put them in a blog 
completely outside of the context of who

2147
01:31:17,561 --> 01:31:22,561
you are,
what your style of communicating with 

2148
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:26,340
has always been on the show.
The style of communicating on the show 

2149
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:26,530
has always been him screaming.
She's always done that,

2150
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:30,310
so when he does that in a twitter form,
it's par for the course.

2151
01:31:30,311 --> 01:31:33,400
I mean that's what he does.
It's just when he does it on the radio,

2152
01:31:33,850 --> 01:31:36,010
the people that are going to be upset at
that,

2153
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:38,770
they would have to listen to the whole 
thing to get to that.

2154
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:41,950
They would have to listen to that chunk.
Someone would have to alert them to it.

2155
01:31:41,951 --> 01:31:44,230
They'd have to like listen to it all 
play out.

2156
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,090
All they have to do is just hear it,
see it,

2157
01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:47,350
retweet it,
see it,

2158
01:31:47,351 --> 01:31:52,351
retweet it,
see it on a blog and then a bunch of 

2159
01:31:52,351 --> 01:31:52,540
fucking outrage attached to it and all 
these accusations,

2160
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:53,130
but

2161
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:54,720
what do you do at that point?
I mean on.

2162
01:31:54,721 --> 01:31:59,721
In your opinion,
do you come out in high defense of 

2163
01:31:59,721 --> 01:32:01,900
yourself or do you just go sit back and 
go?

2164
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,600
My.
His resume kind of speaks for itself.

2165
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:09,601
Like you could just look at his body of 
work and notes that he's clearly not a 

2166
01:32:09,601 --> 01:32:10,400
outwardly racist.
I mean like that.

2167
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:15,450
Well,
a lot of people who want to kill those 

2168
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:15,450
people to his world or like

2169
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:16,110
a lot of people disagree with you there.
A lot of people disagree with you.

2170
01:32:16,111 --> 01:32:18,720
That's a fact.
A lot of people take a lot of the things

2171
01:32:18,721 --> 01:32:23,721
that he said on the radio show,
cut them out of context and put it up 

2172
01:32:23,721 --> 01:32:26,940
and say that these are more pieces of 
evidence that he's racist.

2173
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:29,580
I don't think he's racist.
I think he's frustrated.

2174
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:34,640
I think that he liked a lot of people 
that have been involved in these types 

2175
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:38,621
of scenarios.
You only see the person's attacking you 

2176
01:32:38,621 --> 01:32:41,991
and you only see the group that they're,
they're attached to and if I lived in 

2177
01:32:41,991 --> 01:32:43,380
New York and I had to deal with a lot of
bullshit on a regular basis,

2178
01:32:43,381 --> 01:32:44,580
I don't know how much bullshit he deals 
with,

2179
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:49,820
but whether it was bullshit coming from 
Irish people or it's bullshit coming 

2180
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:49,820
from,
you know,

2181
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,840
Asian people that are fuck with me all 
the time.

2182
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:56,040
I mean if you were living in a group 
where there's a certain number of people

2183
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:58,710
from x community that are causing a lot 
of crimes,

2184
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:00,720
you're always gonna have some 
frustration.

2185
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:02,190
You're going always going to be upset 
about that.

2186
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,860
I don't know where his head's at.
I don't,

2187
01:33:04,861 --> 01:33:09,861
I've never had like long,
like uncensored conversations with him 

2188
01:33:09,861 --> 01:33:13,431
about this.
I've talked to him on the radio and I 

2189
01:33:13,431 --> 01:33:13,431
love talking to them,
so I.

2190
01:33:13,431 --> 01:33:13,470
If I had to guess,
I would say no,

2191
01:33:13,471 --> 01:33:17,820
I don't think he's racist.
I think he's just not scared of speaking

2192
01:33:17,821 --> 01:33:22,800
his mind about very controversial issues
that could very easily come across cross

2193
01:33:22,801 --> 01:33:27,801
as racism when he's describing things 
like very real statistics like crime 

2194
01:33:28,531 --> 01:33:30,990
statistics,
like they're undeniable mean if you look

2195
01:33:30,991 --> 01:33:35,991
at crime statistics and the amount of 
young African American men that are in 

2196
01:33:35,991 --> 01:33:36,690
jail,
it's fucking bananas.

2197
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:39,750
It's bananas representative of the 
population as a whole.

2198
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:44,900
Like this small amount of people that 
are black and then the large amount of 

2199
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:45,690
black guys that are in jail.
You would go,

2200
01:33:45,691 --> 01:33:47,700
okay,
well is that evidence of racism?

2201
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:53,230
That's why they're being prosecuted,
or is it evidence that they're 

2202
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:54,390
committing far more crimes?
Is it a combination of both?

2203
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:59,660
Is it a lack of social awareness that 
has allowed these inner cities to get 

2204
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:01,110
completely out of hand and these 
impoverished neighborhoods the.

2205
01:34:01,111 --> 01:34:02,020
Yeah,
I think that,

2206
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,510
but all the fury is just going to be 
that.

2207
01:34:03,511 --> 01:34:04,240
He was like,
you know,

2208
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:05,770
some black bitch basically,
you know,

2209
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:10,830
just to just be so dismissive.
This no one's carrying about the 

2210
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:10,830
statistics he's throwing out.
They're only focusing,

2211
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:13,740
but my point is you can get those facts 
out.

2212
01:34:14,490 --> 01:34:16,710
If it had been a bunch of Irish people 
and he was like,

2213
01:34:16,711 --> 01:34:17,760
you know,
this,

2214
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:23,030
this mic ginger fuck just punched me,
punched me in the face because he's 

2215
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:23,040
white.
He could do it,

2216
01:34:23,041 --> 01:34:27,090
but he could do it.
But then his tweets would resonate more.

2217
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:32,120
It wouldn't make any kind of news,
but at least it would resonate more if 

2218
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:32,120
he had some kind of facts and figures to
support,

2219
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,610
you know,
whatever the violence problem.

2220
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:41,350
I find it interesting though that after 
all this recent shit about him being 

2221
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:45,191
racist,
that he doesn't just kinda back off and 

2222
01:34:45,191 --> 01:34:45,710
just for like a year talk about cupcakes
or something.

2223
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:49,720
He's actually pushing it almost to the 
point of like,

2224
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,190
like

2225
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:53,510
you're like is really proven

2226
01:34:53,870 --> 01:34:55,070
my speech and,
and,

2227
01:34:55,071 --> 01:34:56,540
and,
and everything like that.

2228
01:34:56,541 --> 01:34:59,390
He's almost to make a point about,
you know,

2229
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:00,070
what,
what do you,

2230
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:01,570
what are the examples you're talking 
about?

2231
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:02,230
Well,
like,

2232
01:35:02,231 --> 01:35:05,680
you know,
after all this thing of him being racist

2233
01:35:05,681 --> 01:35:10,681
on twitter.
Then he started going off on Ferguson 

2234
01:35:10,681 --> 01:35:10,681
Ferguson stuff and then.

2235
01:35:10,681 --> 01:35:15,380
Well,
what did you see when you talk about 

2236
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:17,371
things like that,
like do you know specifically what he 

2237
01:35:17,371 --> 01:35:17,371
said about Ferguson?
I know I can pull it up at that memory.

2238
01:35:17,371 --> 01:35:19,810
What we know is about what Joe Derosa 
talked about the other day,

2239
01:35:19,811 --> 01:35:24,811
but he didn't cite any specifics either.
So I don't know what Anthony said about 

2240
01:35:24,811 --> 01:35:28,621
Ferguson.
If I knew that I can comment on it 

2241
01:35:28,621 --> 01:35:28,621
specifically.

2242
01:35:28,621 --> 01:35:28,621
Well,
I mean,

2243
01:35:28,621 --> 01:35:32,030
I mean I follow them on twitter and he.
He's still doing silly things that you 

2244
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:33,220
think about Ferguson.
Yeah.

2245
01:35:33,221 --> 01:35:38,221
You gotta keep blowing stuff up to go 
that deep into that point.

2246
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,730
What I'm saying is you can go on his 
twitter and see what I'm saying,

2247
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:43,630
but what I'm talking about,
he doesn't back off.

2248
01:35:43,631 --> 01:35:44,130
Well,
he doesn't have.

2249
01:35:44,430 --> 01:35:46,210
He doesn't.
He doesn't back off for a reason.

2250
01:35:46,211 --> 01:35:47,650
It seems like.
I think most people,

2251
01:35:47,651 --> 01:35:49,780
if you got that much,
like you lost your job,

2252
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:52,750
you got in trouble on twitter about a 
certain subject.

2253
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:57,840
Then I'm like alright,
I'm not going to talk about Pi for 

2254
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:57,840
awhile.
Definitely

2255
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:57,840
because he.
Because he immediately show,

2256
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:02,290
yeah,
he immediately made like a chunk of 

2257
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:02,290
money,
you know,

2258
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:02,290
it's like a netflix subscription type 
thing.

2259
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:06,890
So he immediately made like a gang of 
money off that I assume so.

2260
01:36:06,891 --> 01:36:08,960
I don't know.
I don't know how well he's doing,

2261
01:36:08,961 --> 01:36:10,490
but I hope he does.
Well.

2262
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:15,670
I thought that it'd be probably smarter 
if he did it through subscription that 

2263
01:36:15,670 --> 01:36:15,670
way more or through,
um,

2264
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:21,170
through advertisers because advertisers,
that way,

2265
01:36:21,171 --> 01:36:26,171
you know,
it's going to get a large number of 

2266
01:36:26,171 --> 01:36:26,171
people that are gonna listen to it 
because if it's free,

2267
01:36:26,171 --> 01:36:26,171
you know,
like,

2268
01:36:26,171 --> 01:36:27,980
but he's Kinda like hamstringing himself
by making a subscription service.

2269
01:36:27,981 --> 01:36:30,000
But I think it's tough to make it costs 
money.

2270
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:32,030
Like you're definitely cutting people 
out of it,

2271
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,710
but I think there'll be an initial 
thing,

2272
01:36:33,711 --> 01:36:36,380
but you have to like get people to catch
latch on board.

2273
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:41,030
It's really hard to get people to pay 
for Shit on the Internet in this day and

2274
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:46,030
age.
Howard Stern Howard stern gives you 

2275
01:36:46,030 --> 01:36:46,030
like,
you know,

2276
01:36:46,030 --> 01:36:46,570
I mean you basically are paying for 
serious for like that or,

2277
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:51,580
and a.
and you can't argue that like starring 

2278
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:51,580
channel that gives you tons of energy 
for what you're paying.

2279
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:53,060
Like he gives you a lot of different 
stuff.

2280
01:36:53,061 --> 01:36:58,061
It's like him all day and other shows 
and there's old content and just like 

2281
01:36:58,061 --> 01:36:59,660
fun productions and stuff.
But that's not online.

2282
01:36:59,661 --> 01:37:02,150
That's on serious.
It's like if you subscribed to series,

2283
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:03,410
is that what you're saying?
You can get that online took.

2284
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:03,640
Yeah.
Yeah,

2285
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:05,690
but I'm saying but I told her for making
people pay for something.

2286
01:37:05,691 --> 01:37:08,510
But he had but he did 20 some years of 
giving it for free.

2287
01:37:08,511 --> 01:37:13,511
So now you can get or you.
We're talking about two different 

2288
01:37:13,511 --> 01:37:16,391
things.
We're talking about satellite radio or 

2289
01:37:16,391 --> 01:37:16,391
we're talking about Internet 
subscription.

2290
01:37:16,391 --> 01:37:16,550
Does he have an internet subscription?
Was same thing.

2291
01:37:16,551 --> 01:37:19,400
I mean it is like you could watch it 
online sterns thing.

2292
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:21,500
Well Sorta,
but it's satellite radio.

2293
01:37:21,501 --> 01:37:26,501
You're working for a company.
I mean it's not like what Anthony's 

2294
01:37:26,501 --> 01:37:29,081
doing.
Anthony's doing completely independent 

2295
01:37:29,081 --> 01:37:29,081
Internet subscription thing.
I was confused,

2296
01:37:29,081 --> 01:37:33,460
but now Howard went from being for free 
to ask for basically it costs money to 

2297
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:34,370
listen to them if you want to.
I'm saying,

2298
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:35,450
oop,
going from like,

2299
01:37:35,451 --> 01:37:40,451
you know,
he didn't live as a free and then years 

2300
01:37:40,451 --> 01:37:40,451
of,
you know,

2301
01:37:40,451 --> 01:37:43,070
he wasn't a specific charge for Sirius 
xm even though he was like,

2302
01:37:43,071 --> 01:37:43,610
yeah,
he wasn't.

2303
01:37:43,611 --> 01:37:48,611
But now he's asking for a netflix amount
of money for one show.

2304
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:50,660
That's what I'm saying.
There's no variety.

2305
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:51,410
There's no like,
uh,

2306
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,030
he's not really giving you anything 
besides.

2307
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,710
Well,
that's very true to our show.

2308
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,980
It's very different because first of

2309
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,500
all serious is in so many cars.
When you buy it,

2310
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:03,860
you buy it,
you get a 90 day subscription and it 

2311
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:05,400
plays and you get to listen to stern.
You get addicted to it and listen to all

2312
01:38:05,401 --> 01:38:06,900
the different music channels to get 
addicted to it.

2313
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:10,470
But you're paying for satellite radio.
You're not paying for a specific show on

2314
01:38:10,471 --> 01:38:15,471
the Internet.
That is a complete total difference in 

2315
01:38:15,471 --> 01:38:17,571
what you're getting.
Like the get something on the Internet 

2316
01:38:17,571 --> 01:38:18,270
is what I'm saying.
It's very difficult to pay for.

2317
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:20,430
Get people to pay for something that's 
on the Internet.

2318
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:23,100
It's not difficult to get people to 
subscribe to satellite radio,

2319
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:24,960
especially the satellite radios in their
car.

2320
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,810
Bazillions of people like Netflix and 
that's all Internet based.

2321
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:31,470
Yeah.
Netflix gives you thousands of options.

2322
01:38:31,471 --> 01:38:36,471
That's the point I'm making.
I think it's hard to be able to pay for 

2323
01:38:36,471 --> 01:38:36,471
like one,
two hour show a day,

2324
01:38:36,471 --> 01:38:40,551
four days a week,
flicks his movies and television shows 

2325
01:38:40,551 --> 01:38:40,551
me.

2326
01:38:40,551 --> 01:38:41,700
If you're paying for Netflix,
you're paying for something that you can

2327
01:38:41,701 --> 01:38:43,980
watch on television.
I mean it gives you a good watch,

2328
01:38:43,981 --> 01:38:48,981
anthony show on TV,
but that's not how most people are 

2329
01:38:48,981 --> 01:38:51,591
probably watching it.
I bet the majority of the people that 

2330
01:38:51,591 --> 01:38:53,730
listened to a show or getting it,
they're getting it on like as a,

2331
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:58,760
as an audio thing that they listened to 
on the subway or something or in the 

2332
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:01,521
car.
That's what most people do with these 

2333
01:39:01,521 --> 01:39:01,521
things.
It's just it's hard to get people to pay

2334
01:39:01,521 --> 01:39:02,300
for Shit online.
You know what I mean?

2335
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:07,310
People are trying to do it.
Like drive plus is a drive is a youtube 

2336
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:08,450
channel that I really love.
It's a.

2337
01:39:08,570 --> 01:39:13,570
it's all about very sports cars and the 
inner workings of them and they do all 

2338
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:18,381
these really cool in depth pieces.
They just changed their format and then 

2339
01:39:18,381 --> 01:39:22,090
it became drive plus and they made 
people subscribed to it and the video 

2340
01:39:22,681 --> 01:39:23,310
they did it to.

2341
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:25,350
The first one was one that I was a part 
of.

2342
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:30,620
This shark works company that makes 
these cars and the comments were just 

2343
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:34,290
filled with pissed off people.
He was so fucking mad.

2344
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:39,710
I mean they were so mad that all of a 
sudden they were going to be forced to 

2345
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:40,770
have to pay.
I forget what the amount of month is.

2346
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:42,990
I don't think it was a lot like five 
bucks or something.

2347
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,900
I don't remember though.
And people,

2348
01:39:45,930 --> 01:39:50,930
the entire comments for the video was 
all about people being angry that they 

2349
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:52,710
had to pay for it.
The to Hulu thing was with their or fall

2350
01:39:52,711 --> 01:39:54,420
off or whatever.
When they went from,

2351
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:59,510
hey,
have it all for free to like now we 

2352
01:39:59,510 --> 01:39:59,510
charge you.
Yeah.

2353
01:39:59,510 --> 01:39:59,510
I don't know.
I bet they lost a lot of people.

2354
01:39:59,510 --> 01:40:01,950
I mean that's just what happens.
People don't want to pay for shit,

2355
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:03,810
but Netflix is so good.

2356
01:40:03,810 --> 01:40:08,810
There's so much stuff and they have 
their own independent programming like 

2357
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:12,800
that house of cards show or they're 
doing a Chelsea handler's going to do a 

2358
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:12,800
show on it,
like they're.

2359
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:15,780
They're actually becoming like a 
network,

2360
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:20,870
so if you pay x amount a month for it,
the amount of content that they have 

2361
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:25,040
access to is fucking incredible.
I like that plan to or they just 

2362
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:26,010
released the season as a whole right 
away.

2363
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:31,430
That really does make for like,
well there's also some weird shit that 

2364
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:34,731
goes on with them with like cable 
Internet providers and did different 

2365
01:40:34,731 --> 01:40:39,141
internet providers.
Like now they're going to have to pay 

2366
01:40:39,141 --> 01:40:39,690
more because they use up more like they 
have to cut deals.

2367
01:40:39,691 --> 01:40:42,660
Otherwise they throttled back netflix 
users.

2368
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,960
There's a lot of like weird shady shit 
when it comes to like bandwidth and how 

2369
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:52,131
much bandwidth is worth and how much 
bandwidth gets soaked up by different 

2370
01:40:52,131 --> 01:40:53,190
applications.
Which shitty Ben Affleck,

2371
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,070
Justin timberlake movie

2372
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,910
or you're going to make about that guys 
fighting for bandwidth.

2373
01:40:56,911 --> 01:40:58,480
The behind the scenes war

2374
01:40:59,370 --> 01:41:01,590
with wars.
Yeah.

2375
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:02,550
It's tricky,
man,

2376
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:06,180
if you're trying to sell shit online,
unless you're a Netflix,

2377
01:41:06,181 --> 01:41:11,181
like if hbo became an online thing only 
even with all their awesome shows that 

2378
01:41:11,181 --> 01:41:13,050
they have there will be tough.

2379
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:18,300
Although that said the hipsters have 
dominated that world and a lot of them 

2380
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:22,561
don't do cable at all and just get like 
a subscription to hbo go and Showtime 

2381
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:25,720
Dot Com and all that stuff and they 
watch all their shit like that.

2382
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,700
Well there's a lot of people that do it 
through itunes.

2383
01:41:27,701 --> 01:41:29,140
Yeah,
you do like apple,

2384
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,260
you know,
you'd get an apple tv thing and you kind

2385
01:41:31,261 --> 01:41:35,290
of get a switch and all those things.
It's probably cost you somewhere like 50

2386
01:41:35,291 --> 01:41:40,291
bucks a month and you could be pretty 
much have access to everything like the 

2387
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:40,291
next day.
Pretty close.

2388
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:44,920
I mean there's a lot of shit you get.
I mean I use a itunes for a.

2389
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:49,960
I use the apple TV to watch that show,
the strain and I tried to watch it on 

2390
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:51,170
regular TV.
Oh my God.

2391
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:53,630
The fucking commercials make you 
hemorrhage.

2392
01:41:53,870 --> 01:41:58,870
You can't leave.
How often the fucking commercials come 

2393
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:01,661
on.
It's like a couple minutes in Bam as 

2394
01:42:01,661 --> 01:42:01,661
another commercial and then a couple 
minutes after that,

2395
01:42:01,661 --> 01:42:02,570
Bam,
there's another commercial like,

2396
01:42:02,571 --> 01:42:03,470
oh my God,

2397
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:05,790
like they just assault you with 
commercials.

2398
01:42:05,970 --> 01:42:10,230
I keep cable direct TV for a few.
One of the football package is huge,

2399
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:15,290
but two,
there's also something that makes me 

2400
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:15,470
feel like an adult having,
having,

2401
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:17,040
having a cable.
Do you know what I mean?

2402
01:42:17,041 --> 01:42:19,110
Like you're supposed to have cable.
I don't know why,

2403
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:21,240
but it really does.
It mean just like a.

2404
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:23,970
either I stopped now but for a long 
time.

2405
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,990
Well,
beyond needing one.

2406
01:42:24,991 --> 01:42:27,850
I always had a house phone,
like a land logs.

2407
01:42:27,851 --> 01:42:32,851
I was like,
you're supposed to have a landline just 

2408
01:42:32,851 --> 01:42:35,241
in case,
but it's just gone off the cell phone 

2409
01:42:35,241 --> 01:42:35,241
now

2410
01:42:35,241 --> 01:42:38,410
after a while.
Well it's also like you don't ever want 

2411
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:38,410
to have something that you can't just 
turn off.

2412
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:42,640
Yeah.
The beautiful thing about cell phones 

2413
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:42,640
just shut that bitch off and nobody can 
put.

2414
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:43,910
Yeah.
But um,

2415
01:42:44,270 --> 01:42:45,770
yeah,
like those,

2416
01:42:45,771 --> 01:42:48,610
a lot of people do that Netflix thing 
now where they don't have cable.

2417
01:42:48,611 --> 01:42:52,070
I just have netflix and use the computer
for shit.

2418
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:54,620
And then hook up one of those.
I do it right now.

2419
01:42:54,621 --> 01:42:59,621
I just went and it's great because you 
could just target what you want instead 

2420
01:42:59,621 --> 01:43:00,020
of listening to background noise.
Pretty much.

2421
01:43:00,710 --> 01:43:01,670
Yeah.
That's probably smart.

2422
01:43:01,671 --> 01:43:04,040
Keep you from watching as much stuff 
too.

2423
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:06,860
Not just flipping through the channels 
and then you want,

2424
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:11,950
you know,
sometimes there's a search process to 

2425
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:11,950
like,
what do I want to see here?

2426
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:15,400
And you'd go on and sometimes I'll take 
a half an hour just looking for a good 

2427
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:15,710
movie to watch.
It's just wasted half hour here.

2428
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:21,260
But like having cable,
like I'll never seek out the movie 

2429
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:23,160
breaking ever again.
But I'll watch the last 45 minutes of it

2430
01:43:23,161 --> 01:43:25,460
three times a week if it plumps on.
Yeah.

2431
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:27,600
If I'm flipping through the channels and
roadhouse comes on,

2432
01:43:27,601 --> 01:43:29,040
it's like 2:00
and you're not going to stop.

2433
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:33,250
I'm going to wash that shit.
It's like a gift of the universe.

2434
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:38,520
If you're like alone in a hotel room,
flipping through the channels and 

2435
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:38,520
Roadhouse,

2436
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:38,690
you're on the road,
he'll start laughing.

2437
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:43,720
You gotta watch it.
You owe it to the Jeff Healey band to 

2438
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:43,720
deal with.
I want you to be nice until it's time to

2439
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,580
not be nice.
How I know that is.

2440
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:51,090
I will tell you,
my mom used to come home from work in 

2441
01:43:51,090 --> 01:43:51,090
the middle of the night and feed my 
little brother.

2442
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:52,130
We didn't

2443
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:57,130
have cable and we had a VCR and we had 
roadhouse and she'd watch roadhouse 

2444
01:43:57,130 --> 01:43:59,000
every night.
My mother knows every road roadhouse.

2445
01:43:59,001 --> 01:44:00,500
That's ridiculous.
Yeah,

2446
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:02,120
it was a vhs.
Whoa.

2447
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:04,340
You have vhs.
Oh my God.

2448
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:10,060
I had that and hard to kill on the same 
tape and we watched it constantly.

2449
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:15,520
You know what's amazing?
If you could go back in time to when 

2450
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:15,520
those,
uh,

2451
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,730
video stores were out,
like a local video store is like every 

2452
01:44:18,730 --> 01:44:18,920
community.
How to like a local video store,

2453
01:44:18,921 --> 01:44:20,330
like a mom and pop video.
Sure.

2454
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:22,580
And then the blockbuster came in and 
fucking,

2455
01:44:22,581 --> 01:44:23,620
oh my God,
blockbusters.

2456
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:25,790
Gonna shut down all these mom and pop 
video stores.

2457
01:44:25,791 --> 01:44:28,760
And a lot of ways they did.
Except blockbuster didn't have porn.

2458
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:30,980
That's what kept them alive.
So if you wanted to get the porn,

2459
01:44:30,981 --> 01:44:35,981
you'd have to go to the mom and pop 
video stores came back to that day when 

2460
01:44:35,981 --> 01:44:39,611
those things were all like everywhere 
and you said within a couple of decades 

2461
01:44:39,801 --> 01:44:41,420
these won't even exist anymore to go.

2462
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:46,420
You're gone.
You're going to get everything out of 

2463
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:46,420
the air.
People will be like,

2464
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:46,420
what?
Yeah,

2465
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:50,531
he just going to press a button on a 
machine and you're going to get it out 

2466
01:44:50,531 --> 01:44:53,261
of the air specifically for porn.
What you had to go through to like our 

2467
01:44:53,261 --> 01:44:57,281
franchise in Philly,
we had a place called west coast video 

2468
01:44:57,281 --> 01:44:58,520
and you had it all and there's red 
boxes.

2469
01:44:58,521 --> 01:45:00,360
Everything was going to have red box.
There was no,

2470
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:03,430
like the covers were up on the wall.
You got a red box.

2471
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:08,680
And the beauty of that was I would try 
to just like find like my mom and step 

2472
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:11,690
pop would rent porno movies when I was 
younger I guess for them,

2473
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:14,990
for themselves.
And I would they leave in the VCR.

2474
01:45:14,991 --> 01:45:16,430
We only had one VCR,
so they,

2475
01:45:16,431 --> 01:45:18,380
I guess they'd watch it when I stayed at
my grandma's and I'd come,

2476
01:45:18,381 --> 01:45:23,381
I'd see the title of it and I will 
always find titles that weren't very 

2477
01:45:23,381 --> 01:45:27,431
porn sounding and then I would go stay 
at my grandma's the next night and I 

2478
01:45:27,431 --> 01:45:27,530
would tell her like,
hey,

2479
01:45:27,531 --> 01:45:30,140
if I reserve movies,
go pick them up and I would reserve.

2480
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:31,800
That's it.
My little grand mom,

2481
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:34,210
go pick up porn movies for me.
It's God.

2482
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:36,500
She'd be wanting to make popcorn and 
we'll watch it together.

2483
01:45:36,501 --> 01:45:37,040
I'm like,
Oh,

2484
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:41,710
I'm going to probably watch it later.
Did she ever call you on it now?

2485
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:45,290
But one time I never returned one and 
they ended up calling and uh,

2486
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:47,060
to keep it,
I just tried to keep.

2487
01:45:47,061 --> 01:45:48,530
It was a terrible.
It wasn't even a point.

2488
01:45:48,531 --> 01:45:50,030
It was when I rented,
it was like a,

2489
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:52,490
like a skit,
a maxi type thing.

2490
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:55,310
I had a friend that if the videos were 
really good,

2491
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:57,350
he would not bring them back because he 
was like,

2492
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:59,920
I'll take the penalty.
I need to keep this one borns.

2493
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:03,920
Oh,
I had a guy take me a court for that,

2494
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:09,370
for not returning and then eventually,
like the only reason I got the hook 

2495
01:46:09,370 --> 01:46:09,720
eventually is it was a mom and pop place
that went on there.

2496
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:14,740
It's called wow video.
There was a mom and pop place when I 

2497
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:15,020
used to hang out this pool hall in White
Plains,

2498
01:46:15,021 --> 01:46:17,420
New York,
and there was a mom and pop place across

2499
01:46:17,421 --> 01:46:21,560
the street that they found out had tracy
lord videos that were illegal.

2500
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:26,740
Wow.
And the guys at the pool hall found out 

2501
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:26,740
about it and so they took them all and 
they,

2502
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:27,770
uh,
they pay the penalty on all of them.

2503
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:30,380
They just like,
they're like,

2504
01:46:30,381 --> 01:46:33,350
these are valuable because she's under 
age and I'm like,

2505
01:46:33,351 --> 01:46:33,960
Bro,
that shit,

2506
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:39,620
what the fuck you doing?
She means she looked like she was of 

2507
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:45,011
age.
She had large breast diseases and she 

2508
01:46:45,011 --> 01:46:47,261
was,
she looked like she was enjoying it 

2509
01:46:47,261 --> 01:46:47,261
sexually.
This big banana tits.

2510
01:46:47,261 --> 01:46:47,870
Yeah.
They were weird sets,

2511
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:50,460
but I'm beautiful girl.
But anyway,

2512
01:46:50,461 --> 01:46:53,820
she was fucking like 17 years old or 16 
years old at the time when they were.

2513
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:57,510
When she was making these big soft.
These guys found out about it.

2514
01:46:57,630 --> 01:46:58,770
Yeah.
Well the whole deal.

2515
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:01,290
She was a woman.
I mean she looked like a woman.

2516
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:03,990
She's obviously a little girl,
but if you looked at her like,

2517
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:04,920
what is that?
You'd say,

2518
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:06,630
well that's a naked woman.
No,

2519
01:47:06,690 --> 01:47:07,080
no,
no.

2520
01:47:07,081 --> 01:47:08,430
She's 16.
You piece of shit.

2521
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:12,570
What the fuck?
How would I know you showed me or naked.

2522
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:17,750
I watch a documentary is like,
her boyfriends were like in their mid 

2523
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:21,830
twenties,
early thirties and shit with none of 

2524
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:21,830
them have any idea.
You mean the guys on the show?

2525
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:24,200
Our actual boyfriends.
She had her boyfriend show orange.

2526
01:47:24,490 --> 01:47:26,880
I'm calling the porn video.
This show,

2527
01:47:26,881 --> 01:47:29,940
the guy that she dated the porn stars 
for Awhile.

2528
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:31,320
Oh,
she dated this guy,

2529
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:36,350
Tom Byron.
Remember when there's only like four 

2530
01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:38,901
dudes porn stars like Peter North.
Tom Is always the first one because he 

2531
01:47:38,901 --> 01:47:38,901
shut the biggest load.

2532
01:47:38,901 --> 01:47:39,590
Isn't it?
Weirdly gay?

2533
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:42,930
That's the reason it's gay or that he 
did gay porn did before that.

2534
01:47:42,931 --> 01:47:44,010
Yeah,
he did gay porn,

2535
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:49,190
uh,
wasting those big loads on dude buts I 

2536
01:47:49,190 --> 01:47:53,520
don't know about wasting.
I'm enjoying it and this is pre Viagara,

2537
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,770
so he was really getting hard for gay 
guys.

2538
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:00,800
He stayed in there like he stayed in the
game a really long time simply because 

2539
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:03,060
of those loads.
There were ridiculous.

2540
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:04,830
The fact that I know what you're talking
about,

2541
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:07,320
like if you brought it up about any 
other performer,

2542
01:48:07,321 --> 01:48:09,130
you'd be like,
I'm calling them performer.

2543
01:48:09,430 --> 01:48:11,670
What do you call them?
What do you call a guy?

2544
01:48:11,671 --> 01:48:13,800
This artist's chicks,
adult artists.

2545
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:19,010
Peter North powerhouse,
sort of everybody knew those were the 

2546
01:48:19,010 --> 01:48:21,450
things you knew Ron.
Jeremy can count down from 10 and income

2547
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:23,950
and Peter North shoots,
but I didn't know that.

2548
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:29,660
Everybody knows that.
I didn't fucking know that you guys had 

2549
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:32,190
jeremy know that all was porn is what he
would do.

2550
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:37,240
He's counting down from 10 or it has the
girl countdown and then when she says 

2551
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:37,890
when he pulls out and blows a load,
no kidding.

2552
01:48:37,891 --> 01:48:39,270
Really.
I had no idea.

2553
01:48:39,271 --> 01:48:40,380
No idea about that either.
Yeah,

2554
01:48:40,381 --> 01:48:43,650
that's a weird thing to know.
You guys take a little time into another

2555
01:48:43,651 --> 01:48:44,830
hedgehog.
Watch it.

2556
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:46,940
How many points have you watched?
Oh,

2557
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:49,920
tons.
I stack collection action.

2558
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:54,980
Yeah.
And all the tapes were the tapes were 

2559
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:54,980
red rose,
like shitty colors to read.

2560
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:56,610
Videotapes.
Yeah,

2561
01:48:56,611 --> 01:49:01,611
right.
The cheapest fucking stuff that I had a 

2562
01:49:01,611 --> 01:49:01,611
friend side.
I had a friend who had two vcrs,

2563
01:49:01,611 --> 01:49:06,140
black dude named frank.
He would just make compilation of like 

2564
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:07,680
his favorite come a great.
They were great to borrow.

2565
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:13,040
No because whatever it was,
it was like fat ass white bitches and 

2566
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:15,980
then just be like all.
So he was like the first compilation 

2567
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:18,630
guys because they have compilations now 
the way before the Internet.

2568
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:23,780
But I think if I was a,
I'd have a severe problem if I grew up 

2569
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:27,921
with like the Internet.
It was good that I was here that I had 

2570
01:49:27,921 --> 01:49:29,961
to like really work to get my porn use 
severe problem if you had instant 

2571
01:49:29,961 --> 01:49:30,390
access.
Absolutely.

2572
01:49:30,391 --> 01:49:35,391
And I feel so young.
I think a lot of people do have a 

2573
01:49:35,391 --> 01:49:35,391
problem and I think it's as someone who 
has a daughter,

2574
01:49:35,391 --> 01:49:38,160
I fucking hate that.
You know,

2575
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:40,230
facial cumshots as part of the common 
day,

2576
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,940
you know what I mean?
Like that's what you do right out of the

2577
01:49:41,941 --> 01:49:46,200
gates center sex to right as the gates 
sexually know.

2578
01:49:46,201 --> 01:49:49,600
One girl,
like I said,

2579
01:49:49,601 --> 01:49:51,430
I'm not going back to that.
I'm 36 years old,

2580
01:49:51,431 --> 01:49:56,431
but I do remember in school like the 
girls who fucked it was kind of quiet 

2581
01:49:56,431 --> 01:49:58,680
and the ones who everybody knew fucked 
were kind.

2582
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:00,670
They were kind of Shitty to them.
They kind of got like,

2583
01:50:00,671 --> 01:50:02,320
you know,
like oh she's a slut.

2584
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:05,200
Which was just all the guys wishing they
were fucking,

2585
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:10,480
you know,
wishing they were fucking her but still 

2586
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:10,480
like vilify,
you know,

2587
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:14,280
I think,
I think the Internet is just like made 

2588
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:14,920
that completely like 16 year old girls 
talking about who sucks Dick Better.

2589
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:16,990
That's crazy.
Is that really what's going on?

2590
01:50:16,991 --> 01:50:20,020
Are you there when this is happening?
Are you hearing rumors now?

2591
01:50:20,021 --> 01:50:20,770
It's happening.
No,

2592
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:20,910
no,
no,

2593
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:21,780
no,
sure.

2594
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:25,090
I have siblings who were very younger 
than me because I was step father.

2595
01:50:25,630 --> 01:50:28,150
So I have a sister who still in high 
school.

2596
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:30,190
Oh.
So I mean like she's,

2597
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:35,420
you know,
hopefully the best of my knowledge not 

2598
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:37,141
doing this stuff,
but they were doing a thing a few years 

2599
01:50:37,141 --> 01:50:37,141
ago where the,
uh,

2600
01:50:37,141 --> 01:50:37,570
the kids would wear the colors,
you snap off the color,

2601
01:50:37,571 --> 01:50:38,380
that means like,
you know,

2602
01:50:38,410 --> 01:50:41,470
finger your asshole in the locker room 
and then you go do it.

2603
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:43,260
And the girls would always be like,
ugh,

2604
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:46,990
so unfair like walk and they would just 
go do it because he goes,

2605
01:50:46,991 --> 01:50:49,180
oh yeah,
that was the rule of bracelet rule.

2606
01:50:49,190 --> 01:50:51,580
If you imagine if that was going on when
I was young,

2607
01:50:51,590 --> 01:50:52,930
I don't know,
I would never be a comic,

2608
01:50:52,931 --> 01:50:54,640
that's for sure.
I would have got nothing done.

2609
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:56,950
Do you really believe that though?
Yeah.

2610
01:50:57,550 --> 01:50:59,670
You would eventually become a comic.
You would just get bored of it.

2611
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:00,670
Maybe.
Maybe.

2612
01:51:00,671 --> 01:51:02,950
But I mean I,
even now I had one point,

2613
01:51:02,951 --> 01:51:05,590
I lived with a guy who worked for the 
cable company,

2614
01:51:05,591 --> 01:51:08,350
so we got unblocked.
Just a shitty playboy channel.

2615
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:13,920
Like how benign the playboy channel is.
And if I was playing madden on the 

2616
01:51:14,261 --> 01:51:17,890
loading screens on playstation two,
I would constantly flip back,

2617
01:51:17,950 --> 01:51:20,860
like back and forth to the playbook to 
see whatever it was [inaudible] there'll

2618
01:51:20,861 --> 01:51:23,050
be a girl with her pussy out and that 
would just for some reason I like,

2619
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:28,080
I'm going to watch that for a minute and
then come back to the loading screen 

2620
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:28,080
date.

2621
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:31,020
Remember when they had fake porn that 
like Emmanuelle series on showtime.

2622
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:34,630
You'd watch these weird movies.
It was like kind of,

2623
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:39,650
it wasn't,
it was romance that wasn't designed for 

2624
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:42,481
women.
It was like romance that was designed 

2625
01:51:42,481 --> 01:51:44,821
for couples or men to watch.
So it eventually got two people having 

2626
01:51:44,821 --> 01:51:49,261
sex.
But all you really saw was like you saw 

2627
01:51:49,261 --> 01:51:51,730
breasts and he saw the man,
like fake humping the girl.

2628
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:56,910
But he knows he saw no penetration.
But you could tell like their organs 

2629
01:51:56,910 --> 01:52:00,541
were ms.like
their sexual organs were not lined up 

2630
01:52:00,541 --> 01:52:00,541
correctly.
Was blowing them.

2631
01:52:00,541 --> 01:52:01,390
But she's like head butting him in the 
chest.

2632
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:06,550
Yeah.
And if he was banging her like where's 

2633
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:06,550
her pussy sitting there and belly 
buttons.

2634
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:07,630
Weird.
Some strange place.

2635
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:09,230
None of it made any sense,
you know,

2636
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:12,060
and,
but they were fake Moan,

2637
01:52:12,570 --> 01:52:14,830
uh,
and they were always on late at night.

2638
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:16,470
That crap,
man,

2639
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,820
do they.
I couldn't jerk off that.

2640
01:52:18,821 --> 01:52:22,210
Now if I tried for a long,
there's no way I'm too far gone.

2641
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:24,820
Yeah,
you can't go back.

2642
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:26,770
But you could if you were like trapped 
though,

2643
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:32,070
like if you were like in the Amazon 
jungle for like six months and then all 

2644
01:52:32,070 --> 01:52:32,560
of a sudden you got to a hotel room 
like,

2645
01:52:32,590 --> 01:52:34,600
oh my God,
tv and you flip through the channels and

2646
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:38,070
carry on.
Emmanuelle was on and it was like little

2647
01:52:38,090 --> 01:52:43,090
shitty filter because there are those 
cameras they used back then were dog 

2648
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:46,741
shit.
So it was like there was no adhd really 

2649
01:52:46,741 --> 01:52:49,771
low and kind of Fuzzy and Oh,
I used to be able to jerk off to like 

2650
01:52:49,771 --> 01:52:51,500
the girls gone wild like promo video on 
like each channel night.

2651
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:54,380
But I mean it's just like,
that's just such a thing of the past.

2652
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:56,060
I couldn't even.
Everyone was like,

2653
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,420
how could you,
why you couldn't get so excited to the,

2654
01:52:59,421 --> 01:53:00,680
uh,
the fattening thing.

2655
01:53:00,681 --> 01:53:04,730
All the celebrity nudes that came out 
because still images.

2656
01:53:04,731 --> 01:53:07,400
I can't check off the still images 
anymore.

2657
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:09,440
Yeah,
and the only thing that's hard about it.

2658
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:14,470
Well they're hot,
but it's just that they're famous and 

2659
01:53:14,470 --> 01:53:17,650
you know them from something else.
That's always a big thing about porn 

2660
01:53:17,650 --> 01:53:19,370
stars.
It's like people used to have this idea,

2661
01:53:19,371 --> 01:53:22,790
at least that the really beautiful women
were important stars to really beautiful

2662
01:53:22,791 --> 01:53:25,280
women were like Cindy Crawford or you 
know,

2663
01:53:25,610 --> 01:53:27,710
whoever fill in the blank.
Farrah Fawcett,

2664
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:30,090
those are the really beautiful ones.
And the porn stars zero.

2665
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:35,110
A couple of notches behind.
But there's porn stars today that are 

2666
01:53:35,110 --> 01:53:35,820
fucking tens.
Yeah.

2667
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:38,270
Unbelievably beautiful.
If you look at and be like,

2668
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:41,990
that girl could be Lindsay Lohan.
She could be a supermodel.

2669
01:53:42,110 --> 01:53:45,870
She could be anything.
And she's just getting old.

2670
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:47,660
Yeah.
Good Dick,

2671
01:53:47,661 --> 01:53:48,770
you know,
talk about.

2672
01:53:49,190 --> 01:53:54,040
But they've also like removed like the 
excitement of exits.

2673
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:59,050
So out there like there's still 
something more exciting if you saw a 

2674
01:53:59,050 --> 01:54:01,781
girl that was hot at the gas station and
somehow you were able to see her 10 

2675
01:54:01,781 --> 01:54:05,621
minutes later,
like do something where you opened the 

2676
01:54:05,621 --> 01:54:05,621
door by accident.
She was naked.

2677
01:54:05,621 --> 01:54:05,840
That's way more exciting.
Do you know what I mean?

2678
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:10,250
I guess because you're seeing them.
It's from a different context.

2679
01:54:10,251 --> 01:54:15,251
Like a porn star,
you know you're going to see if that 

2680
01:54:15,251 --> 01:54:16,580
same pornstar happened to be the star of
a Sitcom and you saw her naked.

2681
01:54:16,581 --> 01:54:18,530
That would make that so much more 
exciting.

2682
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,500
But the fact that she's,
you know her from sucking Dick,

2683
01:54:21,530 --> 01:54:23,090
like seeing her pussy.
Isn't that exciting?

2684
01:54:23,570 --> 01:54:25,190
I guess I see what you're saying.

2685
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:30,250
Yeah.
Unless you weren't being inundated with 

2686
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:30,250
porn.
See if you.

2687
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:32,840
If you're being inundated with porn,
I think that's the real issue is you get

2688
01:54:32,841 --> 01:54:36,050
numb to the porn and then with the real 
excitement is like,

2689
01:54:36,051 --> 01:54:37,820
oh,
I'm not supposed to be seeing this porn.

2690
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:39,710
So it makes it exciting.
My favorite comment,

2691
01:54:39,711 --> 01:54:44,711
if you weren't going video shit,
if you weren't getting inundated with 

2692
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:46,280
porn and then you saw some porn,
some naked sex,

2693
01:54:46,281 --> 01:54:47,900
you'd be like,
well this is great.

2694
01:54:47,901 --> 01:54:49,770
You get excited.
Oh yeah.

2695
01:54:49,950 --> 01:54:51,590
Numbness.
That's what it is.

2696
01:54:51,591 --> 01:54:52,910
Yeah.
Well you're also get like A.

2697
01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:57,080
I think I also used to be able to jerk 
off and fucking three minutes.

2698
01:54:57,140 --> 01:55:02,140
Now it's like a.
it's a whole process because you're 

2699
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:02,140
like,
I could find a better video.

2700
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:04,010
It's like a challenge to yourself and 
then the head shake.

2701
01:55:04,011 --> 01:55:09,011
You make it yourself when you're just 
jerking off to that third one you found 

2702
01:55:09,011 --> 01:55:09,011
like 40 minutes later you're like,
come on man,

2703
01:55:09,011 --> 01:55:10,130
I could have made phone calls.

2704
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:12,410
I got emails to send out a lot of shit 
done.

2705
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:18,270
Yeah,
and here I am right back at the same 

2706
01:55:18,270 --> 01:55:18,270
stupid bachelor party gang.
Bang.

2707
01:55:18,270 --> 01:55:22,900
Well it's like those a monkey tests they
do with cocaine and heroin and give the 

2708
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:27,371
monkey heroin.
They take the heroin once a day and 

2709
01:55:27,371 --> 01:55:29,771
they're straight.
They give them monkeys coke and they 

2710
01:55:29,771 --> 01:55:29,840
just keep hitting that coke button until
they're fucking hearts explode.

2711
01:55:31,170 --> 01:55:36,170
You know?
There's something about giving guys 

2712
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:38,621
access to constant 24 hour porn.
I mean that's where all that gagging 

2713
01:55:38,621 --> 01:55:42,080
shit and gaping and fucking all the 
abuse porins got to become violent.

2714
01:55:42,230 --> 01:55:43,390
Well,
it comes out like,

2715
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:45,210
what's next?
We've done all this.

2716
01:55:45,211 --> 01:55:50,211
What's next?
We're going to fucking pee and girls' 

2717
01:55:50,211 --> 01:55:50,211
butts.
Okay,

2718
01:55:50,211 --> 01:55:53,420
okay.
How about we p and girls' butts and we 

2719
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:53,420
attached a Straw that pee pee and we 
make them drink it out of their own.

2720
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:55,080
But that guy's in jail.
I said,

2721
01:55:55,170 --> 01:56:00,170
yeah,
he hasn't yelled is out now as you ever 

2722
01:56:00,170 --> 01:56:00,170
see that documentary and Max Heart Max 
hardcore.

2723
01:56:00,170 --> 01:56:00,960
Did you ever see that documentary

2724
01:56:00,980 --> 01:56:03,140
called hardcore where the girl comes 
over from England?

2725
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:07,130
It's a.
it'll make you like furious at that guy.

2726
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:09,900
You ever seen it before?
I think I saw clips of it on effect.

2727
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:12,680
It's a,
it's a girl who comes from England,

2728
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:17,700
you know,
porn producers like your beautiful baby 

2729
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:19,721
you're going to do basically starts off.
We're just gonna do like pictures and 

2730
01:56:19,721 --> 01:56:19,910
lesbian porn.
And then before you know it,

2731
01:56:19,911 --> 01:56:22,300
like they get to sets and it's like,
well I thought you said we're just going

2732
01:56:22,301 --> 01:56:23,150
to watch today.
It's like,

2733
01:56:23,151 --> 01:56:24,260
no baby.
Come on.

2734
01:56:24,261 --> 01:56:26,360
Like I told him,
you're doing this anal porn today.

2735
01:56:26,450 --> 01:56:26,810
She's like,
well,

2736
01:56:26,811 --> 01:56:28,280
I said no anal.
And he's like,

2737
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:28,920
wow,
come.

2738
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:33,960
It's more money if you do it.
And it's really watching them break a 

2739
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:35,420
girl down to a one point,
a Max hardcore,

2740
01:56:35,421 --> 01:56:37,400
I believe it is getting ready to do 
something terrible to her.

2741
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:40,520
And she finally,
after crying he,

2742
01:56:40,610 --> 01:56:43,610
she said she didn't want to do it.
The first thing he does is he walks into

2743
01:56:43,611 --> 01:56:45,770
a room when she's going to meet Max 
Hardcore for the first time,

2744
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:48,830
a bunch of people in this room and the 
documentary crew,

2745
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:54,250
he walks in,
he shakes everyone's hand and goes over 

2746
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:54,250
to her,
seems very real.

2747
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:57,200
Pulls her panties down and stuffs as 
Dick in her asshole.

2748
01:56:57,230 --> 01:56:59,180
And she makes a face like it's pretty 
real.

2749
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:01,850
And she gets weeded out.
And then he goes,

2750
01:57:01,851 --> 01:57:03,770
let's go upstairs.
He starts talking into a scene.

2751
01:57:03,771 --> 01:57:06,260
She says she doesn't want to do it.
He gets really,

2752
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:09,230
first thing he tries to do is hit her 
with the baby.

2753
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:10,410
You're beautiful,
you're going gonna.

2754
01:57:10,411 --> 01:57:12,080
Make a lot of money.
This is a great thing.

2755
01:57:12,081 --> 01:57:17,081
People want to see your beautiful body.
He does that for about five minutes and 

2756
01:57:17,081 --> 01:57:18,110
then he kicks right into you.
Stupid Bitch,

2757
01:57:18,111 --> 01:57:20,300
check or whatever.
Go back to England and tell your kid you

2758
01:57:20,301 --> 01:57:22,280
can't take care of her and just fucking 
okay,

2759
01:57:22,281 --> 01:57:23,420
good.
Can waste my fucking time.

2760
01:57:23,450 --> 01:57:28,450
And then she agreed to do it and the 
documentary guy step in and they turn 

2761
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:32,141
the camera off and just says like,
at this point we thought she wasn't 

2762
01:57:32,141 --> 01:57:32,141
responsible for self anymore.
They pulled her out of it.

2763
01:57:32,141 --> 01:57:34,960
Okay.
Is this a hundred percent confirmed?

2764
01:57:34,990 --> 01:57:37,640
Did you sure that this wasn't in any way
set up?

2765
01:57:37,990 --> 01:57:42,990
That's why you know,
like there's a lot of these porn 

2766
01:57:42,990 --> 01:57:42,990
scenarios where they do a casting 
couches.

2767
01:57:42,990 --> 01:57:42,990
No,
no,

2768
01:57:42,990 --> 01:57:45,070
no,
but there's a documentary couches.

2769
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:46,510
No,
I know that there's other ones that they

2770
01:57:46,511 --> 01:57:48,520
do where it's totally rigged.
Yeah.

2771
01:57:48,521 --> 01:57:50,430
I think most of them always rig,
this is not a thing.

2772
01:57:50,470 --> 01:57:52,720
This is a full length,
like two hour documentary.

2773
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:54,940
It's about this girl that was just one 
scene,

2774
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:57,820
but they showed him fucking her in the 
ass.

2775
01:57:58,300 --> 01:57:59,770
She doesn't.
She's not opposed.

2776
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:01,060
Okay.
But she goes,

2777
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:01,770
yes,
yes.

2778
01:58:01,810 --> 01:58:03,520
They say,
well they don't show it as dick going in

2779
01:58:03,521 --> 01:58:05,380
because it's just not the way.
It's a documentary guy.

2780
01:58:05,381 --> 01:58:07,270
So it's like if it happened in the 
corner over there.

2781
01:58:07,870 --> 01:58:10,390
So they're not showing the actual sex.
Yes,

2782
01:58:10,391 --> 01:58:12,070
they show it.
They just don't show the penetration.

2783
01:58:12,071 --> 01:58:15,370
But you see him put his dinner and she 
and her makeup face and get weird.

2784
01:58:15,371 --> 01:58:17,890
I don't know if that's.
I don't know if that's a setup.

2785
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:22,920
You know what I'm saying?
Like do you know that that's not a set 

2786
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:22,920
up.
Obviously I can't confirm it to 107.

2787
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:27,130
Do a weird thing in this documentary.
Sounds like a real documentary.

2788
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:30,430
I mean if it wasn't a porn documentary,
they would show like real porn.

2789
01:58:30,670 --> 01:58:30,960
Yeah.
No,

2790
01:58:30,970 --> 01:58:32,290
they don't show.
There's no penetration.

2791
01:58:32,291 --> 01:58:35,230
Doesn't necessarily mean it's true that 
that's not necessarily true.

2792
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:36,160
I mean,
I don't know.

2793
01:58:36,670 --> 01:58:39,190
I see what you're saying.
Like it sounds like it could be real,

2794
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:41,080
but it also could be something that they
set.

2795
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:41,900
I don't

2796
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,110
know anything good,
but you know what I mean?

2797
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:46,300
It's the same.
That same world.

2798
01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:51,330
You know what I'm saying?
That world of the fake auditions that 

2799
01:58:51,330 --> 01:58:51,330
turn,
but this isn't.

2800
01:58:51,330 --> 01:58:55,591
This isn't a,
this isn't a jerk off bubble thing in 

2801
01:58:55,591 --> 01:58:55,591
any way.
This whole thing is terribly like,

2802
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:57,340
what the fuck is this guy doing?
This girl was like,

2803
01:58:57,341 --> 01:58:58,890
is he really doing that?
It's not a.

2804
01:58:59,090 --> 01:58:59,670
Oh,
okay.

2805
01:58:59,930 --> 01:59:00,640
It's not,
it's not.

2806
01:59:00,641 --> 01:59:05,641
There's no fancy.
You sit around and you see the 

2807
01:59:05,641 --> 01:59:05,641
documentary guys like,
like even like the,

2808
01:59:05,641 --> 01:59:09,151
you know,
the guys talking to each other like 

2809
01:59:09,151 --> 01:59:09,151
this,
like should we do something?

2810
01:59:09,151 --> 01:59:10,860
So He's just an evil guy that's out of 
control.

2811
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,960
Abusing the shit out of chicks and 
putting it on video.

2812
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:14,110
I've heard them on Howard Stern.
Right?

2813
01:59:14,111 --> 01:59:17,530
It seems like a pretty horrible dude,
but I'm having a little bit,

2814
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,480
but it seemed like a horrible dude.

2815
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:21,010
This is a road Dr.
hold on a second.

2816
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:23,160
What'd you hear?
That he seemed like he was a horrible on

2817
01:59:23,190 --> 01:59:25,330
Howard stern is the way he talked.
The girls come in,

2818
01:59:25,331 --> 01:59:27,120
they want to be porn stars and he just 
like,

2819
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:28,000
he doesn't mean.
It's like,

2820
01:59:28,001 --> 01:59:29,200
well you're a little fat,
but you know,

2821
01:59:29,201 --> 01:59:30,310
I can work with that,
you know,

2822
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:31,450
you know,
right.

2823
01:59:31,451 --> 01:59:33,240
Pig on your face.
And he just kinda like,

2824
01:59:33,241 --> 01:59:36,010
it's like a gruff,
like shitty guys.

2825
01:59:36,110 --> 01:59:39,910
Maybe it's a character for all I know,
but I heard,

2826
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:42,220
but why be the villain?
I mean the guy did go to jail.

2827
01:59:42,450 --> 01:59:43,600
I don't know.
You know what that was for?

2828
01:59:43,601 --> 01:59:46,510
So I'll show you exactly what it was 
before he went to jail for.

2829
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:47,850
No,
really?

2830
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:48,280
Yeah,
yeah,

2831
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:49,480
yeah.
Obscenity laws.

2832
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:51,730
It's a very scary thing.
Look,

2833
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:57,000
I don't think that would he see.
It's a tricky situation because I think 

2834
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,231
anybody with any ethics or morals that 
looks at that guy and what the kind of 

2835
02:00:01,231 --> 02:00:02,560
videos he did,
you don't want to be attached to that.

2836
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:05,650
It's disgusting.
I mean if even if it is fake,

2837
02:00:06,010 --> 02:00:07,090
it's still like,
man,

2838
02:00:07,091 --> 02:00:08,680
what?
Why does this get you off?

2839
02:00:08,681 --> 02:00:13,681
Like you're just,
you're being fucking horrible to these 

2840
02:00:13,681 --> 02:00:13,681
people if that's really what gets you 
off.

2841
02:00:13,681 --> 02:00:15,800
Like what kind of a human being run,
what kind of uh,

2842
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:21,120
what kind of a product are you selling.
But the way they got them is there are 

2843
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:25,511
certain places that have like really 
strict obscenity laws and so they 

2844
02:00:25,511 --> 02:00:29,101
prosecuted him in Florida and it's one 
area that had these really brutally 

2845
02:00:29,101 --> 02:00:30,790
strict obscenity laws.
So they went after this guy,

2846
02:00:30,791 --> 02:00:35,791
they targeted him,
I think they saw the videos and he 

2847
02:00:35,791 --> 02:00:37,060
decided this is a piece of shit and we 
need to put this guy in jail.

2848
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:39,910
And they in their eyes,
the prosecutors eyes.

2849
02:00:39,911 --> 02:00:44,911
I think if I had a guess that they found
a guy who had made this sort of a evil 

2850
02:00:46,151 --> 02:00:49,300
business off of a loophole and that 
loophole was the,

2851
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:54,320
the freedom of expression that he's 
allowed to have his own artistic 

2852
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:55,540
interpretation of what's porn and what's
not porn.

2853
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,180
But anybody like you,
that's a normal guy who wants to,

2854
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:59,530
you like,
this guy's a piece of shit.

2855
02:00:59,550 --> 02:01:02,170
Like he's making movies for fucking evil
people.

2856
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:07,660
Yeah.
To to want to get off to that as a very 

2857
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:07,660
bizarre thing to me it is.
It's definitely very bizarre,

2858
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:12,331
but it's also like at what point in time
is it censorship at one point in time is

2859
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:14,800
like,
who's to say that you can't.

2860
02:01:15,130 --> 02:01:16,930
I mean if you made a movie,
okay,

2861
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:22,020
this is a totally unrelated thing,
but if you made a movie about a guy who 

2862
02:01:22,020 --> 02:01:23,140
was a horrible serial killer,
right?

2863
02:01:23,590 --> 02:01:28,590
And he's very statistic and it's part of
the entertainment is this guy's very 

2864
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:30,580
sadistic and then as long as someone 
catches that guy and kills him,

2865
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:32,200
most of us are like,
wow,

2866
02:01:32,201 --> 02:01:34,420
that was a fucked up movie,
but they got them in the end.

2867
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:39,870
The problem with this is nobody gets it 
in the end except the girl girl gets it 

2868
02:01:39,870 --> 02:01:40,070
in the end.
You know what I mean?

2869
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,740
Like the girl gets abused and it's about
abuse and that's it.

2870
02:01:42,741 --> 02:01:47,741
There's no narrative.
There's no like story arch arch where 

2871
02:01:47,741 --> 02:01:52,361
someone comes along and they fucking 
find this guy and they lock them up in 

2872
02:01:52,361 --> 02:01:52,940
jail at the end and then everybody feels
safe.

2873
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:58,320
Now.
It's just awful from the beginning to 

2874
02:01:58,320 --> 02:01:58,320
the end.
It's awful.

2875
02:01:58,320 --> 02:01:58,320
And then it ends.
There's no plot.

2876
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:01,810
It's just him violating somebody and 
this and this.

2877
02:02:01,870 --> 02:02:06,870
But it rolls on without him though.
I mean there's like a thousand Max 

2878
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:06,870
hardcore,
I'm sure.

2879
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:07,310
Right.
Those guys,

2880
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:10,220
they'll put on a on effect.
I've seen them do those,

2881
02:02:10,221 --> 02:02:12,680
uh,
the compilations of like,

2882
02:02:12,681 --> 02:02:15,520
just not even the sex part,
just the guy's being mean to the chair.

2883
02:02:15,550 --> 02:02:17,270
It's like they,
they bring in like awful,

2884
02:02:17,271 --> 02:02:20,210
like unattractive women and they shit on
them and then fuck them.

2885
02:02:20,211 --> 02:02:21,350
It's very weird.
Yeah.

2886
02:02:21,351 --> 02:02:25,670
And they smack 'em they sign up for the 
news is like physical abuse.

2887
02:02:25,670 --> 02:02:29,000
That would be illegal and you would 
actually go to jail for like,

2888
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:32,630
you can't smack a chicken the face,
but you can't,

2889
02:02:32,670 --> 02:02:34,470
you can't really set a waiver to say 
that's okay.

2890
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:35,870
I,
you sorta can.

2891
02:02:35,871 --> 02:02:36,980
I mean like wrestling,
right?

2892
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:42,580
Ah,
but it's different if it's a guy 

2893
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:42,580
smacking a woman.
I mean,

2894
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:43,580
let's be honest,
isn't it?

2895
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:46,030
I'm morally,
if a guy saw them,

2896
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:50,060
if they're doing a wrestling match and a
guy smacks the guy,

2897
02:02:50,061 --> 02:02:52,250
these guys are,
they're agreeing to this.

2898
02:02:52,550 --> 02:02:55,100
They're both guys.
If two girls are doing it,

2899
02:02:55,130 --> 02:02:57,410
they're both girls.
But if a guy does it do a girl.

2900
02:02:57,890 --> 02:03:02,890
But I mean there's been,
there has to have been pro wrestling 

2901
02:03:02,890 --> 02:03:03,950
storylines where the guy accidentally 
swings and smacks the girl.

2902
02:03:03,970 --> 02:03:06,530
Like that's part of the story lines.
Uh,

2903
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:11,580
I mean,
I just watched the other day a triple h 

2904
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:15,070
put Stephanie Mcmahon and the pedigree.
Well in movies for sure there's been 

2905
02:03:15,070 --> 02:03:15,890
domestic violence in movies without a 
doubt.

2906
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:17,530
But they're not really.
No,

2907
02:03:17,531 --> 02:03:17,780
no,
no.

2908
02:03:17,781 --> 02:03:19,550
But they're not really hitting.
That's the actual contact.

2909
02:03:19,570 --> 02:03:22,250
Nowhere in pro wrestling there is 
conscious that's the difference.

2910
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:24,170
And progressing,
they're actually hitting.

2911
02:03:24,171 --> 02:03:24,830
So if you've,

2912
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,070
there's absolutely TV shows and movies 
that they hit each other.

2913
02:03:28,230 --> 02:03:30,150
No.
You see a woman hit a man.

2914
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:32,470
You never see a man actually hit a woman
in a movie that,

2915
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:33,300
a recent movie.

2916
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:36,690
Well,
I bet you there is in the last year some

2917
02:03:36,691 --> 02:03:40,560
show that you have a,
a man hit a woman and it's a real hit.

2918
02:03:40,650 --> 02:03:43,280
No,
they can make no jersey shore though.

2919
02:03:43,390 --> 02:03:44,670
No,
but that wasn't set up.

2920
02:03:44,700 --> 02:03:47,070
You can make it look like it's a real 
fear.

2921
02:03:47,370 --> 02:03:49,680
You could make it look like it,
but I've never seen.

2922
02:03:49,740 --> 02:03:53,820
I've never seen a woman cough,
a man or a man cuff,

2923
02:03:53,821 --> 02:03:56,040
a woman in the face where I thought it 
was real.

2924
02:03:56,120 --> 02:04:01,120
That Jersey shore,
a Snooki got punched in the face by 

2925
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:01,120
dude.
Yeah.

2926
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:04,401
That was real hundred percent versus 100
or she got blasted and that's the type 

2927
02:04:04,581 --> 02:04:07,110
of thing you can't fake.
I mean she just got popped.

2928
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:09,970
That guy was a fucking savage.
That guy was a schoolteacher.

2929
02:04:10,070 --> 02:04:12,510
I know an MMA fighter.
Was He really?

2930
02:04:12,511 --> 02:04:13,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

2931
02:04:13,590 --> 02:04:18,590
I mean he just uncorked on her face.
I guess MMA has been around long enough 

2932
02:04:18,590 --> 02:04:21,951
now.
There's just finally there's some guys 

2933
02:04:21,951 --> 02:04:21,951
coming out and disgracing the sport a 
little bit.

2934
02:04:21,951 --> 02:04:23,280
There's always going to be crazy people 
and everything.

2935
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:26,750
Sports players,
fucking whatever competition.

2936
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:29,610
Aggressive Holo athletes or people that 
are nuts.

2937
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:33,870
You're going to run into people,
I mean in the most unlikely scenario,

2938
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:39,050
if it's a competition,
you know you're going to run into not 

2939
02:04:39,050 --> 02:04:39,050
even if it's a competition,
there's

2940
02:04:39,050 --> 02:04:43,070
probably asshole dentists that'll punch 
in the face of they're doing shots and 

2941
02:04:43,070 --> 02:04:43,070
then sometimes it works out as mma.
Guys,

2942
02:04:43,070 --> 02:04:44,000
it works out great.
What?

2943
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:46,230
Remember that was at a world star hip 
hop video with the.

2944
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:50,130
Was it down in DC?
Kind of unassuming white dude.

2945
02:04:50,730 --> 02:04:53,280
Oh,
Ryan Hall dropped a big black guy.

2946
02:04:53,281 --> 02:04:54,780
Right.
And the guy who gave up eventually.

2947
02:04:54,790 --> 02:04:56,150
Yeah.
And then it shows white party,

2948
02:04:56,370 --> 02:05:00,060
the black dudes later and mounted them.
Do you need me to kick his ass?

2949
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:02,640
Just held him down and just our grappled
and let them know.

2950
02:05:02,641 --> 02:05:07,641
Yeah.
Let them know that it's going to get 

2951
02:05:07,641 --> 02:05:07,641
worse.
That's so awesome.

2952
02:05:07,641 --> 02:05:11,210
Yeah.
Well especially if you haven't grappled 

2953
02:05:11,210 --> 02:05:11,210
before,
you get tired so quick like,

2954
02:05:11,210 --> 02:05:11,210
okay,
okay,

2955
02:05:11,210 --> 02:05:15,621
get off me.
Like you don't have enough energy left 

2956
02:05:15,621 --> 02:05:15,621
to attack them.
Like there's nothing left.

2957
02:05:15,621 --> 02:05:20,150
I love.
I love bullies getting knocked out 

2958
02:05:20,150 --> 02:05:20,150
video.

2959
02:05:20,150 --> 02:05:20,150
I do love those.
Those make me happy.

2960
02:05:20,150 --> 02:05:24,080
It's nice when you see that as comics.
I think what you said about the thing 

2961
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:26,931
about punching up earlier,
it really is like we do seek justice to 

2962
02:05:26,931 --> 02:05:26,931
some degree.
For sure.

2963
02:05:26,931 --> 02:05:29,490
The,
I just have a problem with the statement

2964
02:05:29,491 --> 02:05:32,400
that all good comedy is punching up.
That's just not true.

2965
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:37,480
It's a lot of good comedy that's 
punching sideways in a lot of good 

2966
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:38,150
comedy that's punching down,
but there's no but,

2967
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:41,220
but Louis Ck shitting on his daughter.
There's no,

2968
02:05:41,221 --> 02:05:44,250
like a lack of justice there.
Do you know what I mean in that regard?

2969
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:47,010
Because you said you kind of know it's 
not only as an implied,

2970
02:05:47,011 --> 02:05:48,900
it's very obvious.
He's kidding.

2971
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:51,000
He loves his kid.
Nobody makes an outward.

2972
02:05:51,001 --> 02:05:52,170
Uh,
and it's funny.

2973
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:55,710
No one does make it our thing with the,
the fights people choose to pick.

2974
02:05:55,710 --> 02:05:56,370
When I did,
uh,

2975
02:05:57,150 --> 02:05:58,950
interestingly enough with the daughter 
thing,

2976
02:05:58,951 --> 02:06:01,130
right?
I did fallon a,

2977
02:06:01,150 --> 02:06:04,230
I talk shit about my daughter for the 
first two minutes of it.

2978
02:06:04,650 --> 02:06:09,650
And then I did Michael Vick jokes and 
thousands of hate mails the next day 

2979
02:06:09,991 --> 02:06:13,510
poured in over these Michael Vick jokes 
over imaginary dot.

2980
02:06:13,550 --> 02:06:14,370
I say that,
uh,

2981
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:17,370
he was on my team,
so I have to love him because he's on my

2982
02:06:17,371 --> 02:06:19,320
team at the time.
He's on the Eagle still and I say,

2983
02:06:19,321 --> 02:06:20,820
uh,
I go,

2984
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:22,380
you know,
I know he's a terrible dude and did some

2985
02:06:22,381 --> 02:06:24,000
terrible things,
but while he's on my team,

2986
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:26,520
just when like I'll throw him a dog,
let them tear it apart,

2987
02:06:26,521 --> 02:06:28,440
like a wearable for the end zone if he 
scores.

2988
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:32,130
And I said I'd mail them a box of 
puppies with a photograph of me shushing

2989
02:06:32,131 --> 02:06:36,820
if he wins the super bowl and it killed 
in the room at the end.

2990
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:38,260
But then all the hate mail came in for 
that.

2991
02:06:38,261 --> 02:06:40,470
And it was such a weird thing.
It's like not one person was like,

2992
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:42,300
how do you shit talk your daughter like 
that,

2993
02:06:42,301 --> 02:06:47,301
you know,
you're telling a joke about shitting on 

2994
02:06:47,301 --> 02:06:47,301
her father's day present or something 
she got for you.

2995
02:06:47,301 --> 02:06:48,380
It's like no one cares,
but then there.

2996
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:53,840
But there was petitions online for a 
public apology from me for imaginary 

2997
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:54,840
dogs.
Dogs that don't exist.

2998
02:06:55,310 --> 02:06:55,830
Well,
once

2999
02:06:56,170 --> 02:06:59,200
things happened,
people get excited and they want action.

3000
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:04,620
They want,
they want you to apologize and if they 

3001
02:07:04,620 --> 02:07:05,200
can force you into action that they've 
won some sort of an online contest,

3002
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:06,580
you know,
they've decided.

3003
02:07:06,581 --> 02:07:11,581
They've written a blog about it.
They started the Hashtag make Jay 

3004
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:13,750
Oakerson Hashtag make jay apologize 
specifically.

3005
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:17,680
It's so bizarre to get that wound up 
about comedy ever.

3006
02:07:17,681 --> 02:07:22,681
I don't get about everything man.
I mean every fucking youtube video that 

3007
02:07:22,681 --> 02:07:26,071
comes out as a thousand comments.
People at Duke it out in the comment 

3008
02:07:26,071 --> 02:07:29,441
section and people get fired up about 
almost everything and anything and if 

3009
02:07:29,441 --> 02:07:31,720
they have the license to be offended if 
people have the license to be offended,

3010
02:07:31,870 --> 02:07:33,880
like they could think that what you said
is not funny.

3011
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:35,920
You know,
they can think that what said is cruel,

3012
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:39,880
but this licensed to be offended.
You have her on my show.

3013
02:07:39,881 --> 02:07:41,230
Again,
this is my show.

3014
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:42,130
I like to show

3015
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:44,770
actually blown away though,
like offended people get us,

3016
02:07:44,771 --> 02:07:47,770
but I feel like comedy should be void of
that.

3017
02:07:47,820 --> 02:07:48,580
Of course.
Yeah.

3018
02:07:48,690 --> 02:07:52,570
But sometimes I feel like we're treated 
like we're speaking to fucking congress,

3019
02:07:53,830 --> 02:07:58,830
given affidavits in court.
There's a laughing microphone behind me 

3020
02:07:58,830 --> 02:07:58,830
on a sign,
you know,

3021
02:07:58,830 --> 02:08:00,220
like what do you,
will you see what's going on?

3022
02:08:00,221 --> 02:08:05,221
People are just getting attention.
You talk about it and you engage them 

3023
02:08:05,221 --> 02:08:07,810
and they get to be upset about you and 
find other folks that are upset about it

3024
02:08:07,811 --> 02:08:12,811
as well.
Everybody gets to be good to have a 

3025
02:08:12,811 --> 02:08:12,811
little attention to.
That's why,

3026
02:08:12,811 --> 02:08:16,250
you know,
it's obviously one of the most famous 

3027
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:16,250
moments on the show,
but that's why I was always.

3028
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:17,110
I was,
I was very,

3029
02:08:17,111 --> 02:08:22,111
uh,
tight with Kilstein Jamie Kilstein and 

3030
02:08:22,111 --> 02:08:25,401
one point I'm like,
as a comic coming out against comedy 

3031
02:08:25,401 --> 02:08:27,691
that,
that blew my mind so much when that 

3032
02:08:27,691 --> 02:08:27,691
happened.
Yeah.

3033
02:08:27,691 --> 02:08:27,691
The thing about still once in a while,
yeah,

3034
02:08:27,691 --> 02:08:31,651
I was still once in a while,
go back and watch that whole thing 

3035
02:08:31,651 --> 02:08:32,350
because I'm trying to get where he was 
coming from with that.

3036
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:33,670
Where he's coming from.
It

3037
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:38,010
is a very rigid ideology.
There's a very rigid ideology of,

3038
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:38,600
you know,
what,

3039
02:08:38,630 --> 02:08:43,630
what the,
the down the people that are talking 

3040
02:08:43,630 --> 02:08:44,190
down on it,
we call it the social justice warriors.

3041
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:47,250
They talk about it in a mocking sense,
social justice warriors,

3042
02:08:47,580 --> 02:08:52,580
but social justice warriors like the 
idea behind like this super male 

3043
02:08:52,580 --> 02:08:53,730
feminists,
very liberal,

3044
02:08:53,731 --> 02:08:54,570
very,
you know,

3045
02:08:54,571 --> 02:08:59,571
a lot of them Vegan like this,
this whole idea of do the least amount 

3046
02:08:59,571 --> 02:09:03,531
of harm possible.
They have a very rigid ideology when it 

3047
02:09:03,531 --> 02:09:06,261
comes to certain things.
They don't leave any room for certain 

3048
02:09:06,261 --> 02:09:07,170
things to be discussed in a mocking 
manner,

3049
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:12,770
you know,
and I think that you get stuck in that 

3050
02:09:12,770 --> 02:09:14,370
world if you're in that world.
Like they have very rigid rules.

3051
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:18,060
They don't think you should ever say a 
joke about rape was really fucked up.

3052
02:09:18,061 --> 02:09:19,650
As Jamie had one about rape.

3053
02:09:19,650 --> 02:09:22,500
It was about men getting raped and that 
was okay.

3054
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:24,340
It's like you can't,
you can,

3055
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:28,140
you just can't have any mocking jokes 
about any woman getting raped.

3056
02:09:28,141 --> 02:09:33,141
Even if the Daniel tosh situation,
it was like such an obvious line that 

3057
02:09:33,141 --> 02:09:36,270
she yells out during is if no one knows 
the scenario.

3058
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:41,480
Tosh was on stage and he was asking the 
audience what they wanted to talk about 

3059
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:45,770
because like occasionally someone will 
yell out a subject and it'd be pretty 

3060
02:09:45,770 --> 02:09:45,770
funny,
you know,

3061
02:09:45,770 --> 02:09:46,920
and then you may be able to come up with
a bit from it.

3062
02:09:46,921 --> 02:09:51,921
Who knows?
He's just having a good time with the 

3063
02:09:51,921 --> 02:09:51,921
crowd being loose adlibbing.
Some guy yells,

3064
02:09:51,921 --> 02:09:55,701
talk about rape,
and he goes and he starts listing off 

3065
02:09:55,701 --> 02:09:55,701
all the thing that's not funny about 
rape.

3066
02:09:55,701 --> 02:09:58,260
Like what are you talking about?
What is it?

3067
02:09:58,340 --> 02:10:03,340
The humiliation,
the physical violence like what part do 

3068
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:06,741
you think is funny?
And this woman like self righteously 

3069
02:10:06,741 --> 02:10:09,021
yells out.
Actually there's nothing funny about 

3070
02:10:09,021 --> 02:10:11,721
rape as if he didn't know that is.
If he wasn't saying that exact same 

3071
02:10:11,721 --> 02:10:12,360
thing and he goes,
wouldn't be funny.

3072
02:10:12,361 --> 02:10:14,130
Five guys raped right now.
Like,

3073
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:15,990
and then everybody starts howling 
laughing.

3074
02:10:15,991 --> 02:10:20,991
Why?
Because it's a funny thing to say in 

3075
02:10:20,991 --> 02:10:20,991
that moment.
Sure.

3076
02:10:20,991 --> 02:10:23,710
Into argue against that.
Saying like that promotes a culture that

3077
02:10:23,911 --> 02:10:27,510
accepts rape is completely ridiculous.
What it promotes is,

3078
02:10:28,350 --> 02:10:31,740
is rallying against people that are 
stating the obvious there,

3079
02:10:31,741 --> 02:10:34,040
stating the obvious to take moral high 
ground.

3080
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:35,690
Actually,
there's nothing funny about rape.

3081
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:41,080
Like he was saying that very thing with 
humor that there is nothing funny about 

3082
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:41,510
rape.
When she chimed in,

3083
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:46,990
it's a person that wanted attention.
That's the same person that wrote that 

3084
02:10:46,990 --> 02:10:46,990
blog.
She wrote a blog about it.

3085
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:52,000
That very person was like the nightmare 
person to say that too because she went 

3086
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,580
and she wrote this blog and then he 
wound up giving us like fake apology,

3087
02:10:55,581 --> 02:10:56,540
which is pretty hilarious

3088
02:10:56,650 --> 02:10:57,970
to show you.
Did you see,

3089
02:10:57,971 --> 02:11:02,971
uh,
what law and order Svu did with that 

3090
02:11:02,971 --> 02:11:03,310
story?
They made that into.

3091
02:11:03,370 --> 02:11:05,180
They did.
Oh yeah.

3092
02:11:05,190 --> 02:11:06,390
You know,
they do the polls from the headlines.

3093
02:11:06,391 --> 02:11:07,660
So they had the guy,
first of all,

3094
02:11:07,661 --> 02:11:10,220
they refer to them as like the like 
where you going,

3095
02:11:10,221 --> 02:11:12,400
like we're going up to the college 
campus to watch that.

3096
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:17,820
That new rape comic is intentional.
They call him a rape comment was 

3097
02:11:17,820 --> 02:11:19,170
Jonathan Silverman plays him.
That's hilarious.

3098
02:11:19,171 --> 02:11:24,171
The new rape coming in town.
So he goes up there and his jokes are 

3099
02:11:24,171 --> 02:11:24,171
all about,
you know,

3100
02:11:24,171 --> 02:11:24,750
like fucking chicks against her will to 
some degree,

3101
02:11:26,050 --> 02:11:27,340
but everyone loves him.
He's,

3102
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:30,340
he's getting huge applause and cheers.
Oh my God.

3103
02:11:30,750 --> 02:11:35,750
The SV into.
What's funny about that is at one scene 

3104
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:36,070
after they,
they suspect a,

3105
02:11:37,090 --> 02:11:41,050
he goes on trial because a girl almost 
got raped after his show.

3106
02:11:41,650 --> 02:11:46,650
A girl was a fan of his and they tried 
to make the argument that these guys 

3107
02:11:46,650 --> 02:11:49,891
wouldn't have tried to rape her if they 
weren't all goosed up from his comedy 

3108
02:11:49,891 --> 02:11:53,521
show.
Well that was the actual argument and 

3109
02:11:53,521 --> 02:11:54,580
what they ended up doing with the story 
was first thing they do,

3110
02:11:54,581 --> 02:11:59,581
it made me laugh was the whole Svu team 
goes and sits front row at his comedy 

3111
02:11:59,581 --> 02:12:04,081
show is what they do first and they're 
just sitting there staring and shaking 

3112
02:12:04,081 --> 02:12:07,141
their heads and you almost want to go.
You guys are actually being a pretty 

3113
02:12:07,141 --> 02:12:07,690
shitty audience.
Like at the end of the day,

3114
02:12:07,691 --> 02:12:10,210
it's like if you're going to sit there 
and stare at least sit in the back.

3115
02:12:10,211 --> 02:12:15,211
Like that seems like kind of a weird.
Like you're making the show get weird 

3116
02:12:15,211 --> 02:12:15,790
and rapey by staring,
staring at him,

3117
02:12:16,090 --> 02:12:21,090
but then when they do,
the big payoff is at the end of the 

3118
02:12:21,090 --> 02:12:21,090
whole episode.
They make that.

3119
02:12:21,090 --> 02:12:22,910
He was also a rapist.
A.

3120
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:25,810
I actually tweeted out,
I was like pretty fucking irresponsible.

3121
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:29,050
Like that's a really irresponsible thing
that for the first show I got to do.

3122
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:30,440
You would think that it,
by the way,

3123
02:12:30,441 --> 02:12:32,600
the kind of people that actually would 
be rapists,

3124
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:37,840
they would be talking about how rape is 
awful because they would probably be 

3125
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:42,251
trying to throw people off the yes,
they wouldn't be like raping all the 

3126
02:12:42,251 --> 02:12:44,780
time and then joking about rape and all 
the time like that sounds like the exact

3127
02:12:44,781 --> 02:12:49,781
opposite of what you would do if you 
were trying not to get busted being a 

3128
02:12:49,781 --> 02:12:50,150
fucking rapist.
Crack jokes.

3129
02:12:50,210 --> 02:12:52,850
Are you trying to loosen people's 
expectations?

3130
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:55,160
Remember there was a comedian rapists 
remember that?

3131
02:12:55,490 --> 02:12:57,530
Oh yeah.
That would backtrack of schools.

3132
02:12:57,590 --> 02:13:02,590
He would go to colleges and he would 
rape girls at colleges and he would ask 

3133
02:13:02,590 --> 02:13:03,380
them to pray for him.
Really?

3134
02:13:03,710 --> 02:13:04,790
Vince champ.
Yeah,

3135
02:13:04,791 --> 02:13:05,520
but they need to do a thing,

3136
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:08,850
but then he'd do.
He would go like those block bookings,

3137
02:13:08,890 --> 02:13:12,320
like he would go to one school,
pick up the check,

3138
02:13:12,321 --> 02:13:13,970
go to the next goal and then double 
back.

3139
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:16,160
So that's how the.
I think he pulled it off for awhile.

3140
02:13:16,630 --> 02:13:18,910
I didn't know he had a strategy.
Did you have a strategy and what?

3141
02:13:18,911 --> 02:13:21,040
I understand I could be wrong with that 
obviously,

3142
02:13:21,041 --> 02:13:26,041
but that's where I've.
I've heard that from several sources 

3143
02:13:26,041 --> 02:13:28,771
that it was like a doubling back thing.
He won star search in 1992 and he's 

3144
02:13:28,771 --> 02:13:33,241
serving a 55 to 70 year sentence for 
committed at college campuses on a 

3145
02:13:33,241 --> 02:13:35,100
standup circuit.
How many did they say?

3146
02:13:35,101 --> 02:13:36,760
How many rapes?
There's a bunch.

3147
02:13:36,770 --> 02:13:41,770
I don't know man.
The story I'm looking for has been 

3148
02:13:41,770 --> 02:13:41,770
removed from the.

3149
02:13:41,770 --> 02:13:43,230
How many rapes were the while there was 
somebody rapes

3150
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:48,750
nineties.
Like I rates it was in the late 

3151
02:13:48,750 --> 02:13:48,750
nineties.
Yeah.

3152
02:13:48,750 --> 02:13:50,500
I don't know how many guys,
how many girls he raped,

3153
02:13:50,501 --> 02:13:52,750
but he would have asked them to pray for
them,

3154
02:13:52,751 --> 02:13:55,290
which is really fucked.
Rave.

3155
02:13:55,370 --> 02:13:57,700
The last thing a chick wants to hear 
what you're raping them.

3156
02:13:58,470 --> 02:13:59,710
You feel bad about the rape.

3157
02:13:59,950 --> 02:14:01,600
I think rape,
rape,

3158
02:14:01,601 --> 02:14:06,601
there always has to be like,
it seems to me like there's gotta be a 

3159
02:14:06,601 --> 02:14:08,890
shut up or I'll do this element to it 
because I feel like you just couldn't.

3160
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:14,000
It's like professional wrestling,
like how you couldn't suplex somebody 

3161
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,651
like a vertical suplex that doesn't want
to be suplex that you couldn't possibly 

3162
02:14:16,651 --> 02:14:16,651
do it.
Someone I feel like,

3163
02:14:17,230 --> 02:14:20,560
how could you fuck someone who's really 
snapping their legs shut and fighting.

3164
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:22,810
That almost seems like it's an 
impossible task.

3165
02:14:22,930 --> 02:14:26,500
Are you serious?
It's got physically for real.

3166
02:14:26,980 --> 02:14:28,340
Yeah.
I mean it's something that,

3167
02:14:28,660 --> 02:14:30,340
it happens all the time.
Obviously you can happen.

3168
02:14:30,380 --> 02:14:31,900
Nobody saying.
I think there's always an element.

3169
02:14:31,901 --> 02:14:36,901
I think eventually the girl kind of has 
to do like some kind of like get this 

3170
02:14:36,901 --> 02:14:37,390
fucking over.
If you fight physically fight the entire

3171
02:14:37,391 --> 02:14:39,130
time,
I think you almost couldn't pull it off.

3172
02:14:39,550 --> 02:14:40,580
Um,
I don't know,

3173
02:14:40,581 --> 02:14:45,581
man.
I think a guy could probably pull it 

3174
02:14:45,581 --> 02:14:45,581
off.
I think they do.

3175
02:14:45,581 --> 02:14:45,890
I don't know even know what you're 
saying.

3176
02:14:46,010 --> 02:14:47,690
Like guys,
definitely rape.

3177
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:49,170
I know.
No girl,

3178
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:51,650
no price.
Did it make it sound guy to say,

3179
02:14:51,651 --> 02:14:54,480
guys,
don't let guys girls fight them off.

3180
02:14:54,750 --> 02:14:57,000
Still rape him.
That shit happens all the time.

3181
02:14:57,850 --> 02:14:59,760
The land managers bigger,
you know,

3182
02:14:59,761 --> 02:15:01,290
big,
strong men and small women.

3183
02:15:01,291 --> 02:15:02,940
It's probably,
they hold you down.

3184
02:15:04,110 --> 02:15:06,310
The seems pretty obvious I think though 
if needed.

3185
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:07,220
Booze.
No,

3186
02:15:07,350 --> 02:15:09,360
I mean like if you like,
she's not going to be wet,

3187
02:15:09,530 --> 02:15:10,650
you know,
I'm not even talking about that.

3188
02:15:10,651 --> 02:15:14,580
I'm talking to someone like nonstop,
like physically flailing around,

3189
02:15:14,610 --> 02:15:19,050
like to completely subdue someone's for.
Have you ever just like playful?

3190
02:15:19,051 --> 02:15:21,390
He wrestled with the girl,
like with your girlfriend.

3191
02:15:21,430 --> 02:15:22,630
It was like,
uh Oh yeah,

3192
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:23,450
my,
my chicken.

3193
02:15:23,451 --> 02:15:28,451
If I tried to hold her arms and a tickle
her and she's flailing like I don't 

3194
02:15:28,451 --> 02:15:28,680
think I can control her feeling.
She's not a big girl at all.

3195
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:30,930
I control my growers.
He can't move.

3196
02:15:31,410 --> 02:15:35,820
Brian Kicks Ass on police.
He's a fucking savage dude.

3197
02:15:35,821 --> 02:15:37,530
You could stop a rape.
Don't rape.

3198
02:15:37,710 --> 02:15:41,700
Don't forget all personal appearances.
Put that aside.

3199
02:15:41,730 --> 02:15:44,250
He's a savage.
Jesus Christ.

3200
02:15:45,330 --> 02:15:46,500
Control my girl.

3201
02:15:47,270 --> 02:15:48,890
Yeah,
you could look man.

3202
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:51,200
If you know how to wrestle,
you could hold the chick down pretty God

3203
02:15:51,201 --> 02:15:52,420
damn easy.
It's not hard.

3204
02:15:52,940 --> 02:15:53,900
Could hold up dude down,

3205
02:15:54,490 --> 02:15:59,490
but you have to hold her down and 
accomplish something that's sort of 

3206
02:15:59,490 --> 02:15:59,490
intricate to some degree.

3207
02:15:59,490 --> 02:16:02,400
I don't know.
I don't know.

3208
02:16:02,401 --> 02:16:03,800
This is a weird thing to speculate.

3209
02:16:05,330 --> 02:16:08,130
Let's break it down.
How would you take it around the horn?

3210
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:12,300
Classroom?
Judo,

3211
02:16:12,301 --> 02:16:15,600
throw the Jujitsu and I think that,
uh,

3212
02:16:16,170 --> 02:16:21,170
it probably be a Jew.
It's like especially there's a lot of 

3213
02:16:21,170 --> 02:16:21,580
violence involved,
right?

3214
02:16:21,581 --> 02:16:25,300
Like hitting choking.
I don't think it would be hard.

3215
02:16:25,930 --> 02:16:30,670
I mean it would obviously it wouldn't be
as easy as like normal sex.

3216
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:32,060
No,
that's almost making the point.

3217
02:16:32,061 --> 02:16:34,150
I'm saying by the time actually the sex 
part happens.

3218
02:16:34,151 --> 02:16:36,730
I feel like there's just like give up to
some degree,

3219
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:40,390
man.
Yeah.

3220
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:45,420
I guess you can see me appearing at the 
Tomahawk University started announcing 

3221
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:50,320
my college tour.
It's called the don't worry.

3222
02:16:50,321 --> 02:16:52,240
I don't believe I could possibly rape 
you tour.

3223
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:56,590
Hey,
everybody has their own confidence level

3224
02:16:56,820 --> 02:16:58,270
will put up.
They,

3225
02:16:58,390 --> 02:17:03,390
you pull off.
He can't pull off in this life if you 

3226
02:17:03,390 --> 02:17:06,211
feel like you're limited in that regard.
I can never dunk a basketball and I 

3227
02:17:06,211 --> 02:17:06,610
could never break.
I was in two things.

3228
02:17:06,611 --> 02:17:08,740
I physically can't pull off.
He's a fucked up thing,

3229
02:17:08,741 --> 02:17:09,130
man.

3230
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:13,210
That that's like so common in the animal
community like violence and sex.

3231
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:18,540
Like if you ever watched,
I was watching this documentary or is 

3232
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:19,040
listening to this podcast rather,
uh,

3233
02:17:19,050 --> 02:17:24,050
about Tasmanian devils and how vicious 
Tasmanian devils are with each other and

3234
02:17:24,630 --> 02:17:26,350
that while they're having sex,
like they almost,

3235
02:17:26,380 --> 02:17:28,970
they always bite each other.
They're constantly biting each other and

3236
02:17:28,971 --> 02:17:33,971
they fuck each other's faces up like 
when they have sex and they fuck each 

3237
02:17:33,971 --> 02:17:34,750
other's faces up when they're fighting 
over a meal.

3238
02:17:34,940 --> 02:17:39,940
They're constantly going at it.
But there was a disease that was 

3239
02:17:39,940 --> 02:17:41,500
spreading amongst them.
It was actually a type of cancer and the

3240
02:17:41,501 --> 02:17:44,320
type of cancer was actually proving to 
be,

3241
02:17:45,030 --> 02:17:46,870
um,
something that's contagious.

3242
02:17:46,990 --> 02:17:51,990
By some strange manner of evolution.
These cancerous cells would burst and 

3243
02:17:53,051 --> 02:17:55,750
infect the cells around them.
And so they,

3244
02:17:55,751 --> 02:18:00,751
all these,
a Tasmanian Devil started dying off 

3245
02:18:00,751 --> 02:18:00,880
because they started developing these 
cancerous,

3246
02:18:01,030 --> 02:18:04,870
contagious tumors and they were 
constantly biting each other in the face

3247
02:18:05,260 --> 02:18:10,260
so they would be biting into these 
tumors and the tumors would like 

3248
02:18:10,260 --> 02:18:12,400
literally make tumors on the other 
animals.

3249
02:18:12,490 --> 02:18:13,360
Jesus.
Yeah.

3250
02:18:13,361 --> 02:18:17,500
But just constantly attacking fucking 
mangling each other.

3251
02:18:18,070 --> 02:18:23,070
Like that's what they did.
They were just constantly like biting 

3252
02:18:23,070 --> 02:18:24,580
when they fucked his back and they make 
these crazy noises mad.

3253
02:18:24,790 --> 02:18:26,070
This guy who is a,
uh,

3254
02:18:26,310 --> 02:18:27,550
if you ever listen to radio lab,
you know,

3255
02:18:27,551 --> 02:18:30,040
what I'm talking about was amazing 
podcast.

3256
02:18:30,070 --> 02:18:32,800
It's an amazing podcast.
And the podcast is all,

3257
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:38,880
you know,
it's all like really interesting things 

3258
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:42,931
that are like one of them they had about
the problems with trying to communicate 

3259
02:18:42,931 --> 02:18:44,620
with dolphins and just really 
fascinating,

3260
02:18:44,621 --> 02:18:47,170
fascinating stuff.
One of them was on the apocalypse,

3261
02:18:47,350 --> 02:18:52,350
like how,
what the asteroid impact did and how 

3262
02:18:52,350 --> 02:18:55,261
many animals were killed off and what 
the original humans probably looked 

3263
02:18:55,261 --> 02:18:59,731
like.
The thing that became a human that was 

3264
02:18:59,731 --> 02:18:59,731
alive back then,
this fucking burrowing underground mammo

3265
02:18:59,731 --> 02:19:01,860
rodent type thing.
But um,

3266
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:06,900
they were doing this,
this radio lab one on these Tasmanian 

3267
02:19:06,900 --> 02:19:06,900
devils in this cancer that was 
spreading.

3268
02:19:06,900 --> 02:19:08,020
It was fucking madness,
man.

3269
02:19:08,570 --> 02:19:13,570
Want to dig into stuff like that.
Too much of it gives me a genuine 

3270
02:19:13,570 --> 02:19:13,570
anxiety,
especially apocalypse stuff.

3271
02:19:13,570 --> 02:19:14,440
Yeah.
But you know,

3272
02:19:14,441 --> 02:19:14,770
it's like,
oh,

3273
02:19:14,860 --> 02:19:19,120
it was always just a chance to meteor 
size of Texas could destroy the earth,

3274
02:19:19,180 --> 02:19:22,180
which is weird that that became like a 
thing with these animals that they would

3275
02:19:22,210 --> 02:19:26,290
bite and fuck while they're biting,
biting each other in the face.

3276
02:19:26,291 --> 02:19:27,980
And,
and that's not a discussion.

3277
02:19:27,981 --> 02:19:29,690
That's just nature.
What's the nature of it?

3278
02:19:29,691 --> 02:19:31,190
Yeah.
It's not like constantly do it.

3279
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:37,660
Apparently they just bite.
They just always fighting over meat and 

3280
02:19:37,660 --> 02:19:39,200
fucking biting each other in the face 
and flux and kills like immediately.

3281
02:19:39,201 --> 02:19:40,460
So yeah,
same,

3282
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:41,380
you know,
it's like sodas,

3283
02:19:41,390 --> 02:19:42,140
black widow,
right?

3284
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:44,180
Yep.
That's real common insect community.

3285
02:19:45,110 --> 02:19:50,060
I on aunt wants this,
a weird fucking ant that takes,

3286
02:19:50,140 --> 02:19:55,140
they're almost all females and there's 
occasionally males and when they find a 

3287
02:19:55,140 --> 02:19:56,300
male,
they bite his legs off,

3288
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:59,990
they bite his legs off and they bring 
the males like slightly larger.

3289
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:05,230
They bite his legs off and then they 
carry them into the hive to breed and 

3290
02:20:05,230 --> 02:20:06,650
then they wind up killing him.
They make him write a book.

3291
02:20:06,890 --> 02:20:09,230
They just need to cripple them.
He has like wings,

3292
02:20:09,231 --> 02:20:14,231
I think to get the story of misery.
You make them write a book of your 

3293
02:20:14,231 --> 02:20:15,800
favorite character.
We have it.

3294
02:20:15,801 --> 02:20:17,390
So we are such pussies.
You know,

3295
02:20:17,391 --> 02:20:22,391
we,
we have a conversation about how 

3296
02:20:22,391 --> 02:20:22,391
difficult it would be to rape somebody 
and it's a dangerous subject to tread.

3297
02:20:22,580 --> 02:20:25,370
You look into the nature world.
It's like sex without rape.

3298
02:20:25,371 --> 02:20:26,570
They're like,
what are you talking about?

3299
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:28,040
That doesn't even happen.
I wanted it.

3300
02:20:28,041 --> 02:20:28,820
I take it.
Yeah.

3301
02:20:28,821 --> 02:20:33,821
There's the,
that's how you make sure that are 

3302
02:20:33,821 --> 02:20:33,821
fucking.
Well yeah.

3303
02:20:33,821 --> 02:20:35,600
And the,
the lion has to get through all the male

3304
02:20:35,601 --> 02:20:40,601
lions.
He has to prove his worth and then 

3305
02:20:40,601 --> 02:20:41,180
eventually he's going to get pushed out 
by some new young lions,

3306
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:46,400
you know,
because he wants to keep like a few 

3307
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:46,400
checks around and some new young lines 
again,

3308
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:46,610
and then he's going to be out there on 
his own.

3309
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,130
They'd say that's like the biggest 
problem in Africa.

3310
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:52,310
Took a metaphor for snl for the new 
line,

3311
02:20:52,311 --> 02:20:54,200
comes in,
the other one gets sent out to pasture,

3312
02:20:54,230 --> 02:20:59,230
so meadows ever watch that show,
but like with a African villages that 

3313
02:21:00,091 --> 02:21:05,091
the real problem that they have is when 
a lion gets cast out and the females 

3314
02:21:05,541 --> 02:21:10,541
don't get the food anymore than the 
lions have to go get their own food and 

3315
02:21:10,541 --> 02:21:13,901
a lot of those old males,
they start to get crippled and slow and 

3316
02:21:13,901 --> 02:21:15,710
the chip teeth off and shit.
Then they become super dangerous because

3317
02:21:15,711 --> 02:21:18,590
they can't get the normal game animals 
they used to getting.

3318
02:21:18,591 --> 02:21:20,990
So then they start snatching people 
just.

3319
02:21:20,991 --> 02:21:22,850
Oh yeah.
Just so I keep proving themselves.

3320
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:23,950
Well,
there was a leopard writing.

3321
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:29,080
There was a story about.
It was in the news yesterday about a 

3322
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:29,390
leopard in India that they'd taken us 
responsible.

3323
02:21:29,391 --> 02:21:32,690
One individual leopard responsible for 
15 deaths,

3324
02:21:32,750 --> 02:21:37,640
15 different people that had targets,
drunk people and that it waits.

3325
02:21:37,780 --> 02:21:38,520
Yeah.
Fucked.

3326
02:21:38,580 --> 02:21:40,170
Is that to grow?
Yes.

3327
02:21:42,260 --> 02:21:42,980
Spot.
Yeah.

3328
02:21:42,981 --> 02:21:43,640
Well people,
you know,

3329
02:21:43,641 --> 02:21:48,641
they go out and they start partying and 
this leopard is apparently developed 

3330
02:21:48,641 --> 02:21:52,091
this taste for drunk people.
Like he knows that when people come out 

3331
02:21:52,091 --> 02:21:56,051
of these bars,
they're slow and they don't know what 

3332
02:21:56,051 --> 02:21:56,051
the fuck's going on.
They're not on there,

3333
02:21:56,051 --> 02:21:56,200
they're not on the ball and they get 
jacked.

3334
02:21:58,130 --> 02:22:03,130
It's almost weird to walk out of 
anywhere in the world of a bar and 

3335
02:22:03,130 --> 02:22:04,030
there's a leopard waiting for you.
Even in India.

3336
02:22:04,540 --> 02:22:06,020
India is scary with.
In fact,

3337
02:22:06,021 --> 02:22:11,021
in India I find it more weird.
There's a bar than a leopard waiting to 

3338
02:22:11,021 --> 02:22:11,021
kill you.
I feel like the bombing.

3339
02:22:11,021 --> 02:22:11,450
There's bars and India.
Well,

3340
02:22:11,451 --> 02:22:12,830
you know,
it's interesting like India,

3341
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:17,860
everybody always thinks of as being like
this place of peaceful meditation and 

3342
02:22:17,860 --> 02:22:17,860
Yoga.
Right?

3343
02:22:17,860 --> 02:22:19,680
I mean that's.
A lot of people think of desert,

3344
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:25,420
but you,
you hear about all these goddamn gang 

3345
02:22:25,420 --> 02:22:27,461
rapes like India.
These stories of people getting like 

3346
02:22:27,461 --> 02:22:29,410
gang raped on buses and women dying.
You don't.

3347
02:22:29,411 --> 02:22:31,920
You hear about those quite a bit like 
that.

3348
02:22:31,980 --> 02:22:34,410
I wouldn't have normally associated that
with India.

3349
02:22:34,530 --> 02:22:35,540
You know,
we don't,

3350
02:22:35,541 --> 02:22:40,541
we don't think of that,
but it's like when you have a billion 

3351
02:22:40,541 --> 02:22:40,650
people,
you get a lot of crazy shit going on.

3352
02:22:40,740 --> 02:22:43,710
You've got a billion people stuffed on 
what continent he imagined.

3353
02:22:43,730 --> 02:22:43,830
Yes.

3354
02:22:43,900 --> 02:22:45,930
I mean the young people anywhere picking
up on that,

3355
02:22:45,950 --> 02:22:50,950
especially with Internet,
everything picking up on like the 

3356
02:22:50,950 --> 02:22:51,020
culture of all that stuff.
So if you go to South Africa,

3357
02:22:51,021 --> 02:22:53,360
there street gangs,
you know and they think their bloods and

3358
02:22:53,361 --> 02:22:55,340
crips because that's what they see 
really.

3359
02:22:55,460 --> 02:22:56,000
Sure.
Yeah.

3360
02:22:56,030 --> 02:23:01,030
I mean it's not,
I don't think there are directly 

3361
02:23:01,030 --> 02:23:01,030
affiliated,
but there's like there's street gangs,

3362
02:23:01,030 --> 02:23:05,441
you know,
like that kind of thing in South Africa 

3363
02:23:05,441 --> 02:23:05,441
with a weird place like that.
Do you remember

3364
02:23:05,441 --> 02:23:09,070
when there was an ice cube song about 
moving the crips and the bloods to the 

3365
02:23:09,261 --> 02:23:14,261
Midwest now was a song steady mom and I 
think it was road trip.

3366
02:23:16,130 --> 02:23:17,090
It was,
yeah,

3367
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:19,340
it was.
Who was something like that where these,

3368
02:23:19,940 --> 02:23:22,490
these gang bangers.
It got too hot and La.

3369
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:25,910
So they set up gang affiliates in the 
middle of the country.

3370
02:23:26,210 --> 02:23:28,160
Oh,
those are those like southern ones,

3371
02:23:28,180 --> 02:23:31,220
like those documentaries,
Hbo with the white boy gangs,

3372
02:23:31,230 --> 02:23:34,930
like just a bunch of dudes wearing like 
bandannas over their face and caring.

3373
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:38,240
Hey sickles.
More terrifying thing coming your way.

3374
02:23:38,241 --> 02:23:40,730
It's like the children of the corn with 
Doo rags on.

3375
02:23:41,150 --> 02:23:46,150
What was that show?
It was like banging in this bank in 

3376
02:23:46,150 --> 02:23:46,150
Little Rock and little rock.
That's.

3377
02:23:46,910 --> 02:23:49,580
Wow.
That's white trash guys.

3378
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:52,160
Get him geary.
That scared a lot of people.

3379
02:23:52,220 --> 02:23:52,820
Oh yeah.

3380
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:55,770
Banging in little rock type shit.
That scares a lot of people.

3381
02:23:55,771 --> 02:24:00,270
The idea that this gang violence that 
you see in like Inglewood and Compton on

3382
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:03,750
the television shows that that's somehow
under that Boyz in the hood.

3383
02:24:03,751 --> 02:24:05,130
Shit could somehow to make it.

3384
02:24:06,060 --> 02:24:07,680
Yeah.
And it's terrifying.

3385
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:09,240
Split when you see in the south.
It's weird cause it looks.

3386
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:13,560
It's already kind of a scary area of 
like swampy overgrown hedges and stuff.

3387
02:24:13,561 --> 02:24:18,561
And then there's like there's like a 
dude with an Uzi wearing a red flannel 

3388
02:24:18,561 --> 02:24:20,430
and swampy Louisiana whether

3389
02:24:20,770 --> 02:24:21,900
and if you.
Yeah.

3390
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:24,180
Fuck.
And if you're scared of it,

3391
02:24:24,181 --> 02:24:28,350
you're racist.
Just don't hit back.

3392
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:29,130
You know,
I tell you what,

3393
02:24:29,131 --> 02:24:31,320
I've talked about some shit on this 
podcast and gotten,

3394
02:24:31,321 --> 02:24:33,060
you know,
a lot of people's reactions about it.

3395
02:24:33,061 --> 02:24:36,990
But one of the biggest reactions I ever 
got about anything I said was that I was

3396
02:24:36,991 --> 02:24:41,991
talking about John Jones and I said,
I wonder how much of like why is now 

3397
02:24:41,991 --> 02:24:42,420
popular is racism.
I wonder if people are racist.

3398
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:46,830
Even say you wonder that someone might 
be racist.

3399
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:48,840
Like if if someone's reaction to 
something,

3400
02:24:48,841 --> 02:24:53,841
it's probably like flipping of me to say
like that's especially when you're not 

3401
02:24:53,841 --> 02:24:55,900
considering it before you're saying it,
you're just discussing a subject because

3402
02:24:55,901 --> 02:24:56,760
you did.
It's interesting.

3403
02:24:57,390 --> 02:25:02,390
It's such a charged subject.
You've got to have a fully formed idea 

3404
02:25:02,390 --> 02:25:06,080
before you say it.
But just the mere possibility that some 

3405
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:08,340
people can be racist was such a.
like people are so angry,

3406
02:25:08,341 --> 02:25:13,341
like not even saying you're racist.
Not saying the only way that you 

3407
02:25:13,341 --> 02:25:13,341
couldn't.
Like the guy was because of racism.

3408
02:25:13,341 --> 02:25:14,610
I said,
I wonder how much of it is racism.

3409
02:25:14,820 --> 02:25:17,700
I wonder if it's a factor.
Because I always wonder about races.

3410
02:25:17,740 --> 02:25:20,530
I think he gives reasons beyond that,
but I think it's a fair question.

3411
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:23,380
I mean he gives reasons to dislike him,
he see on race.

3412
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:23,770
But

3413
02:25:24,530 --> 02:25:25,330
you know,
at the same time,

3414
02:25:25,331 --> 02:25:26,530
yes,
some people will just,

3415
02:25:26,930 --> 02:25:31,930
is it ridiculous?
The notion that people would just 

3416
02:25:31,930 --> 02:25:32,110
blindly like thing just,
you know what I mean?

3417
02:25:32,111 --> 02:25:35,380
Like I don't know where we'll live in a 
world of apologies,

3418
02:25:35,381 --> 02:25:36,620
don't apologize for asking.
Well,

3419
02:25:36,630 --> 02:25:37,150
it's,
it's,

3420
02:25:37,740 --> 02:25:42,740
it's just such a highly charged subject.
It's a fascinating thing that it's so 

3421
02:25:42,740 --> 02:25:46,321
highly charged that you know,
even a mere suggestion and if people 

3422
02:25:46,451 --> 02:25:51,451
thought in some way that I meant,
if you don't like them is because you 

3423
02:25:51,451 --> 02:25:54,521
racist,
then that's my shitty job of 

3424
02:25:54,521 --> 02:25:55,540
communicating an idea because that's 
certainly was never what I was thinking.

3425
02:25:55,810 --> 02:26:00,810
But what I was thinking was,
I think I know for a fact when I was a 

3426
02:26:00,810 --> 02:26:01,750
kid,
I used to root for white guys.

3427
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:05,920
I just did like when George Gerry Cooney
fought Larry Holmes,

3428
02:26:06,310 --> 02:26:11,310
I remember very clearly being 
embarrassed that I rooted for Gerry 

3429
02:26:11,310 --> 02:26:15,150
Cooney because he was a white guy 
because I remember Larry Holmes box the 

3430
02:26:15,150 --> 02:26:17,200
shit out of him and he just picked them 
apart.

3431
02:26:17,470 --> 02:26:20,050
And before that mean Gerry Cooney was a 
really good fighter.

3432
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:22,360
He was a,
he beat Ken Norton.

3433
02:26:22,361 --> 02:26:24,180
He knocked them out,
devastating knockout,

3434
02:26:24,190 --> 02:26:24,940
and it was like,
it was,

3435
02:26:25,480 --> 02:26:30,480
he was a good fighter,
but Larry Holmes was a master at the 

3436
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:33,871
time and it was just,
I should have been appreciating what 

3437
02:26:33,871 --> 02:26:35,800
Larry Holmes was able to do to this guy 
who'd been able to knock out some really

3438
02:26:35,801 --> 02:26:39,430
good fighters that Larry Holmes was just
using his skill and that it was.

3439
02:26:39,580 --> 02:26:42,490
But I had been rooting for Gerry Cooney,
so when he lost,

3440
02:26:42,491 --> 02:26:43,360
I was like,
Damn.

3441
02:26:43,810 --> 02:26:48,810
It was because it was,
it might've been because he was the 

3442
02:26:48,810 --> 02:26:48,810
underdog too.
I was a kid.

3443
02:26:48,810 --> 02:26:48,810
I was dumb.
I know.

3444
02:26:48,810 --> 02:26:49,330
I was rooting for it because he was 
white.

3445
02:26:49,420 --> 02:26:51,340
I know it was,
it was probably Blake.

3446
02:26:52,510 --> 02:26:55,600
I was a senior or a junior,
maybe a junior in high school.

3447
02:26:55,601 --> 02:26:58,210
So I guess I was 16 and uh,
yeah,

3448
02:26:58,211 --> 02:26:58,840
it was just dumb.

3449
02:26:58,960 --> 02:27:02,470
I mean,
it wasn't that I was racist because it's

3450
02:27:02,500 --> 02:27:03,390
been going well.
What we,

3451
02:27:03,640 --> 02:27:06,100
what you attach to the most,
like what you related to the most?

3452
02:27:06,850 --> 02:27:08,710
I could be that guy.
Yeah,

3453
02:27:08,740 --> 02:27:10,030
most certainly.
Most certainly.

3454
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:12,370
Yeah.
But um,

3455
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:15,160
I did it a little bit when I was 20,
not,

3456
02:27:15,161 --> 02:27:18,570
but not nearly as enthusiastic with 
Tommy Morris screaming,

3457
02:27:18,571 --> 02:27:22,760
I love you white box know with Tommy 
Mars that I was like,

3458
02:27:23,110 --> 02:27:23,800
I just,
you know,

3459
02:27:23,870 --> 02:27:26,440
I was keeping an eye on him.
How'd you feel that?

3460
02:27:26,441 --> 02:27:27,740
The Ray Mercer.
Oh my God.

3461
02:27:27,780 --> 02:27:32,780
After that,
that was the worst thing I've ever seen 

3462
02:27:32,780 --> 02:27:32,780
in my life.
That knockout was so good that my friend

3463
02:27:32,780 --> 02:27:34,510
Kevin,
who is like a huge fan of Tommy Morrison

3464
02:27:34,750 --> 02:27:35,840
was,
was like,

3465
02:27:35,890 --> 02:27:37,060
he wasn't even bummed out.
He was like,

3466
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:38,530
damn,
that dude's awesome.

3467
02:27:38,770 --> 02:27:39,730
Just saying that,
you know,

3468
02:27:39,731 --> 02:27:42,380
ray mercer was so awesome.
Even though he was rooting for Tommy,

3469
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:44,440
it was such a brutal knockout.

3470
02:27:44,450 --> 02:27:46,090
They just wanted to see rand mercer 
fight again.

3471
02:27:46,220 --> 02:27:48,670
So good cuts of Ray Mercer whispering 
and the guys a year,

3472
02:27:48,671 --> 02:27:49,510
a few years later,
like,

3473
02:27:49,570 --> 02:27:52,030
please take it down.
I'll give you half the money.

3474
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:53,950
Who did he say that to?
I forget,

3475
02:27:53,951 --> 02:27:55,860
but it was like a core TV case.
Oh,

3476
02:27:55,870 --> 02:27:57,560
that's right.
Oh my God.

3477
02:27:57,561 --> 02:27:58,780
When they were in the clinch,
he goes,

3478
02:27:59,140 --> 02:28:04,140
take a dive.
I'll give you half the money once that 

3479
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:04,140
was it Bobby Chez?
No.

3480
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:08,280
Who was it that he had a fight with?
He had a fight with someone and it was 

3481
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:08,620
an important.
If you lost the fight,

3482
02:28:09,430 --> 02:28:10,890
he was not going to get a title shot.
Yeah.

3483
02:28:10,910 --> 02:28:12,370
So he was.
That's right.

3484
02:28:12,460 --> 02:28:14,590
Or allegedly he asked him.
I don't know if that's true.

3485
02:28:14,710 --> 02:28:17,560
I don't know if you ever been proven.
Was it ever proven you can look it up?

3486
02:28:17,561 --> 02:28:19,330
I think he may have been found guilty of
that.

3487
02:28:20,380 --> 02:28:25,380
Maybe.
I don't know if you ever watch that 

3488
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:25,380
documentary.
Speaking of boxing,

3489
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:26,300
but the guy,
what was his name?

3490
02:28:26,330 --> 02:28:28,860
Where they,
they made his inside of his gloves.

3491
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:29,990
So Resto?
Yeah.

3492
02:28:29,991 --> 02:28:32,030
Yeah,
they fucked it was billy,

3493
02:28:32,450 --> 02:28:37,450
Billy Collins Jr.
He claims he didn't know he claims he 

3494
02:28:37,450 --> 02:28:37,450
didn't know.
YeaH,

3495
02:28:37,450 --> 02:28:38,720
that was a Panama lewis.
That was the same guy who doctored up.

3496
02:28:38,750 --> 02:28:39,790
Um,
uh,

3497
02:28:40,090 --> 02:28:42,440
aaron priors a drink.
He said,

3498
02:28:42,650 --> 02:28:44,090
don't give me that water.
Give me the other one.

3499
02:28:44,091 --> 02:28:49,091
The one that I fixed.
And then he gives it to aaron pryor and 

3500
02:28:49,091 --> 02:28:51,101
aaron pryor goes out there like a 
fucking bat out of hell and knocks out 

3501
02:28:51,101 --> 02:28:54,431
alexis are way on the next round.
And they said it was some sort of a 

3502
02:28:54,431 --> 02:28:56,721
stimulant and problem.
Aaron pryor rather wind up having a bit 

3503
02:28:56,721 --> 02:28:57,090
of a drug problem.
So rarely been,

3504
02:28:57,150 --> 02:28:58,460
could have been related in that way.

3505
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:01,650
But um,
it's just weird how,

3506
02:29:01,740 --> 02:29:02,410
how the,
the,

3507
02:29:02,411 --> 02:29:06,320
the ferocity of the reactions when I 
brought up this racism thing,

3508
02:29:06,321 --> 02:29:09,110
maybe it was like irresponsible on my 
part,

3509
02:29:09,140 --> 02:29:14,140
but I'm,
I'm sort of happy that I brought it up 

3510
02:29:14,140 --> 02:29:16,151
anyway just because I'm fascinated by 
the response and I'm fascinated by no 

3511
02:29:16,151 --> 02:29:19,070
black people disagreed with me.
That's the weird thing.

3512
02:29:19,460 --> 02:29:20,990
The weird thing is the guys who 
disagreement,

3513
02:29:20,991 --> 02:29:22,700
I don't know everybody who disagree with
me on twitter,

3514
02:29:22,701 --> 02:29:24,350
so I'm kind of talking out of my ass 
here,

3515
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:29,680
but the people that I interact with on a
regular basis where their comics or 

3516
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:30,650
whatever,
they all thought it was.

3517
02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:35,510
The black guYs all thought it was very 
valid that there's certain mount of like

3518
02:29:36,230 --> 02:29:40,940
extra judgment that you give a cocky 
young black athlete and I was like,

3519
02:29:40,970 --> 02:29:42,980
that's fascinating.
I wonder if that's true.

3520
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:44,810
Even just paying attention to that.

3521
02:29:44,810 --> 02:29:49,370
That's something I wonder.
I wonder what if a factor it is and it's

3522
02:29:49,371 --> 02:29:54,371
not.
It's not the only factor that there's 

3523
02:29:54,371 --> 02:29:55,100
$350 million People on this planet in 
this country rather,

3524
02:29:55,400 --> 02:30:00,400
and if you know,
if a million people like you in a 

3525
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:01,400
miLlion people hate you this fucking 
wide variety of reasons,

3526
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:05,780
but to say that out of all the millions 
of people who know who you are,

3527
02:30:05,960 --> 02:30:09,500
that they're on a certain percentage of 
them that are racist seems disingenuous.

3528
02:30:09,770 --> 02:30:12,830
I mean iT seems like there's a certain 
amount of people across the board,

3529
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:15,860
they're going to be racist.
If you have $350 million people.

3530
02:30:16,130 --> 02:30:18,080
I don't know how many people you're 
going to get that the racist,

3531
02:30:18,260 --> 02:30:23,260
but there's gotta be a certain 
percentage that has to be factored in 

3532
02:30:23,260 --> 02:30:23,260
there.
Know,

3533
02:30:23,260 --> 02:30:24,230
seeing.
You wonder how much of it is.

3534
02:30:24,950 --> 02:30:27,440
I think the interesting thing is that I 
think floyd mayweather,

3535
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:30,830
people that hate him,
I bet there's a lot more racism involved

3536
02:30:30,831 --> 02:30:32,050
in that than jon jones.

3537
02:30:32,050 --> 02:30:33,620
Jon jones gives you a pretty valid 
reasons.

3538
02:30:33,621 --> 02:30:37,160
It'd be like sky sort of a dick just 
publicly from what you see,

3539
02:30:37,161 --> 02:30:42,161
you know,
I don't know anything about them other 

3540
02:30:42,161 --> 02:30:42,161
than what I see in the press and on the 
shows.

3541
02:30:42,161 --> 02:30:43,940
But I mean like maybe whether it's a guy
you know,

3542
02:30:43,941 --> 02:30:44,430
you see,
he's like,

3543
02:30:44,450 --> 02:30:46,160
you know,
the press is talking to him.

3544
02:30:46,161 --> 02:30:48,400
He's like throwing $100 bills,
you know,

3545
02:30:48,510 --> 02:30:51,730
just like a master showman.
That regard too though.

3546
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:56,120
But that personality feeds into someone 
who's got racism in their heart.

3547
02:30:56,150 --> 02:30:57,920
That's really,
that fires them up.

3548
02:30:57,950 --> 02:31:00,440
Well.
I've read some horrific shit about.

3549
02:31:00,470 --> 02:31:00,920
Well,
I've read,

3550
02:31:00,950 --> 02:31:02,900
I've read some racist shit about both 
guys,

3551
02:31:02,901 --> 02:31:04,600
about jon jones and about floyd 
mayweather,

3552
02:31:05,030 --> 02:31:10,030
but this recent barrage of shit about 
people like how much hate they have for 

3553
02:31:10,761 --> 02:31:12,860
him after he fought my don and last.
YoU know,

3554
02:31:12,861 --> 02:31:14,600
I don't know if they were betting on my 
door.

3555
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:17,870
I don't know what it is,
but that's also how he sells tickets.

3556
02:31:18,050 --> 02:31:20,160
I mean he sells tickets by people 
wanting

3557
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:23,070
him to lose,
but he so fucking good.

3558
02:31:23,071 --> 02:31:27,090
You could bArely hit him if,
if he gets tagged once or twice hard and

3559
02:31:27,091 --> 02:31:28,770
a fight.
It's shocking and rare,

3560
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:34,040
but there's a lot of fights where he'll 
go like the entire fight to box in 

3561
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:34,830
someone's face off and not get hit at 
all.

3562
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:37,350
So for every sugar,
shane mosley who connects our.

3563
02:31:37,351 --> 02:31:39,150
Every madonna right righthand that 
lands.

3564
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:41,820
This is like a lot of rounds where he's 
not even getting hit.

3565
02:31:41,821 --> 02:31:45,720
He's just slipping out of things,
move in and doing things to you that you

3566
02:31:45,721 --> 02:31:50,721
didn't expect and moving in a way that 
you didn't anticipate and being nowhere 

3567
02:31:50,721 --> 02:31:51,690
near you when you're looking to hit him.
You know,

3568
02:31:51,691 --> 02:31:54,720
he's a master,
but he's also a master at manipulation,

3569
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:59,880
mean he's playing the heel where I think
john is just a young guy figuring it out

3570
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:05,970
on his own while he's one of the baddest
man on the planet at 25 years of age and

3571
02:32:05,971 --> 02:32:10,971
he's had this ridiculous rise to success
that happened in a really short period 

3572
02:32:10,971 --> 02:32:11,220
of time.

3573
02:32:11,220 --> 02:32:16,220
Like from the time he was like 21 years 
old to the time that he's 25 starts 

3574
02:32:16,591 --> 02:32:18,540
martial arts and becomes the light 
heavyweight champion.

3575
02:32:18,790 --> 02:32:20,680
I mean tHat's fucking crazy,
man.

3576
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:25,840
He had a martial art background because 
he was a really good wrestler and did 

3577
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:27,630
know some kicking and punching and stuff
before he started into mma,

3578
02:32:27,780 --> 02:32:30,470
but he got into mma because he got his 
girlfriend pregnant and he,

3579
02:32:30,471 --> 02:32:32,100
you know,
he couldn't go to college.

3580
02:32:32,101 --> 02:32:33,750
He wanted to do the right thing and 
said,

3581
02:32:33,751 --> 02:32:34,320
all right,
fuck it.

3582
02:32:34,321 --> 02:32:39,321
I'll start fighting and then got into it
and he's a crazy road for anybody to 

3583
02:32:39,321 --> 02:32:41,370
take and to be that popular in that 
famous at 25,

3584
02:32:41,590 --> 02:32:44,040
you're going to fuck up man.
But there was going to make mistakes.

3585
02:32:44,060 --> 02:32:49,060
You got to watch.
Can you almost pinpoint what it is when 

3586
02:32:49,060 --> 02:32:50,810
the switch flipped on him?
I remember like I saw I went to,

3587
02:32:50,811 --> 02:32:53,580
I went to ufc 101,
uh,

3588
02:32:53,730 --> 02:32:58,730
in philly,
forrest griffin versus a silver and 

3589
02:32:58,730 --> 02:33:02,060
there he was walking around a jon jones 
is one brand and I remember,

3590
02:33:02,061 --> 02:33:03,890
uh,
my buddy dave was with me was like,

3591
02:33:03,891 --> 02:33:04,930
there's jon jones.
He's like,

3592
02:33:04,940 --> 02:33:06,820
that Guy is bad ass and he's going to be
the next chair.

3593
02:33:06,840 --> 02:33:10,220
Like he was just really pumping up like 
saying how great he was and how fun of a

3594
02:33:10,221 --> 02:33:15,221
young boy.
And then I started paying attention to 

3595
02:33:15,221 --> 02:33:16,601
more and he was amazing.
And then just one day just seems like 

3596
02:33:16,601 --> 02:33:16,601
people were like,
what a dick.

3597
02:33:16,601 --> 02:33:16,620
Some people.
Yeah.

3598
02:33:16,710 --> 02:33:18,630
Yeah.
When people want you to be perfect,

3599
02:33:18,700 --> 02:33:23,700
they're looking for flaws too bad 
motherfucker cheating was the first 

3600
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:24,850
thing I saw.
He didn't do anything wrong in that.

3601
02:33:24,900 --> 02:33:25,320
What do you mean?

3602
02:33:25,590 --> 02:33:27,030
I thought it was weird that he dropped 
him afterwards.

3603
02:33:27,031 --> 02:33:32,031
I know it's an aggressive situation,
but I think dropping a guy that he said 

3604
02:33:32,031 --> 02:33:32,031
he knew it was unconscious was.
It was.

3605
02:33:32,031 --> 02:33:33,360
It was kind of shitty for a sport where 
I thought,

3606
02:33:33,390 --> 02:33:35,190
I thought this is all supposed to be 
handshakes at the end.

3607
02:33:35,810 --> 02:33:37,580
I see what you're saying.
I see what you're saying.

3608
02:33:38,810 --> 02:33:39,910
That mode though.

3609
02:33:40,740 --> 02:33:43,410
You could hear a.
But when he walks over,

3610
02:33:43,411 --> 02:33:44,640
it's funny,
greg jackson,

3611
02:33:44,641 --> 02:33:45,660
that you could hear him say to me.
He goes,

3612
02:33:45,661 --> 02:33:50,661
john goes,
go when these people back and go check 

3613
02:33:50,661 --> 02:33:50,661
out if he's okay.
He says,

3614
02:33:50,661 --> 02:33:50,661
he goes,
go check if he's okay,

3615
02:33:50,661 --> 02:33:51,320
They'll get some fan.
Yeah,

3616
02:33:51,330 --> 02:33:52,890
go get some fans.
Yeah.

3617
02:33:52,891 --> 02:33:53,550
No,
that's true.

3618
02:33:53,860 --> 02:33:54,510
Um,
I think,

3619
02:33:54,600 --> 02:33:58,350
but also I think to be a bad 
motherfucker at that high level,

3620
02:33:58,380 --> 02:34:03,380
like a lot of times these guys are so 
intense that they get completely caught 

3621
02:34:03,380 --> 02:34:03,600
up in it and they just trapped in the 
moment.

3622
02:34:03,870 --> 02:34:07,320
I think I know the dude.
I know him from backstage.

3623
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:10,710
I know him from when he's not fighting 
and he's really friendly.

3624
02:34:10,980 --> 02:34:13,740
He's really good,
but I wouldn't want to be fighting them.

3625
02:34:14,010 --> 02:34:19,010
I think if you're competing against him,
I think he's all those that are at the 

3626
02:34:19,010 --> 02:34:19,010
top of the

3627
02:34:19,010 --> 02:34:23,010
heap there,
pretty fucking ferocious and some guys 

3628
02:34:23,010 --> 02:34:25,651
are better at keeping it together in 
scenarios like that where they don't 

3629
02:34:25,651 --> 02:34:25,930
drop the guy.
Some guys aren't.

3630
02:34:26,020 --> 02:34:31,020
You know what I mean?
Dan henderson is one of the greatest of 

3631
02:34:31,020 --> 02:34:32,611
all times,
one of the most famous moments in his 

3632
02:34:32,611 --> 02:34:35,071
career as he knocked out michael bisping
with his vicious right hand and bisping 

3633
02:34:35,071 --> 02:34:39,031
went soaring.
I mean he was out cold and henderson 

3634
02:34:39,031 --> 02:34:39,310
dropped one on him.
He afterwards,

3635
02:34:39,630 --> 02:34:42,400
he talked about it in the post fight 
interview.

3636
02:34:42,430 --> 02:34:44,800
How he dropped one on it.
I mean that's common.

3637
02:34:44,940 --> 02:34:46,880
So the last one was really running his 
mouth kind of thing.

3638
02:34:46,881 --> 02:34:47,570
Exactly.
Yeah.

3639
02:34:47,770 --> 02:34:52,770
Baba lou,
who's another famous mixed martial arts 

3640
02:34:52,770 --> 02:34:54,640
fighter,
a great fighter who fought in a bunch of

3641
02:34:54,641 --> 02:34:59,641
different organizations.
He lost his gig with the ufc pArtially 

3642
02:34:59,641 --> 02:35:03,481
because he held onto this guy after he 
was done choking them and then talked 

3643
02:35:03,481 --> 02:35:04,780
about it in the post fight precedent 
interview with me,

3644
02:35:05,260 --> 02:35:06,250
you know,
and I'm.

3645
02:35:06,910 --> 02:35:11,140
That guy was not doing anything that bj 
penn hadn't done.

3646
02:35:11,410 --> 02:35:14,610
Bj penn did the sAme thing that jens 
pulver like paula was tapping.

3647
02:35:14,620 --> 02:35:17,080
He's still fucking hung onto it because 
they were angry at each other,

3648
02:35:17,290 --> 02:35:19,210
but Pulver didn't go out,
you know,

3649
02:35:19,211 --> 02:35:24,211
and for whatever reason,
him holding thAt choke for an extra 

3650
02:35:24,211 --> 02:35:27,180
couple of seconds was okay.
Whereas bob blues guy went out and then 

3651
02:35:27,180 --> 02:35:27,180
he talked about it,
but everybody knows why they do live.

3652
02:35:27,180 --> 02:35:31,740
Sure they do it because they're fucking 
caught uP in all the trash talking and 

3653
02:35:31,740 --> 02:35:35,251
all the bullshit and you know,
it is important that a fighter let go 

3654
02:35:35,251 --> 02:35:39,961
and a referee tell them not to,
but it's understandable how these guys 

3655
02:35:39,961 --> 02:35:40,450
get caught up in that.
It's understandable.

3656
02:35:40,550 --> 02:35:44,630
It's got to stop doing it,
but what john did technically is not.

3657
02:35:44,710 --> 02:35:47,050
There's nothing wrong with it because 
when the referee came over to him,

3658
02:35:47,051 --> 02:35:48,280
he didn't keep hanging onto it.

3659
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:51,010
That would have been a more agregious 
example.

3660
02:35:51,011 --> 02:35:52,210
More and more,
you know,

3661
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:58,080
but it is one of those things where you 
appreciate like nate marquardt fought 

3662
02:35:58,080 --> 02:36:02,251
this guy,
damien maia knocked him out with one 

3663
02:36:02,251 --> 02:36:02,770
punch.
Damien was dazed but still conscious and

3664
02:36:02,771 --> 02:36:05,050
marquardt hovered over him and pulled 
back,

3665
02:36:05,160 --> 02:36:07,600
realized he was out of it.
The referee stepped in and stopped it,

3666
02:36:07,601 --> 02:36:10,810
but nate easily could have dropped a 
bomb on him and he didn't end.

3667
02:36:10,811 --> 02:36:13,330
It was a really classy move and people 
really respected that,

3668
02:36:13,331 --> 02:36:16,240
that he did that and I made sure I 
talked about it in the commentary.

3669
02:36:16,241 --> 02:36:18,940
That is a very classy move for jones 
used to do that.

3670
02:36:19,390 --> 02:36:24,390
Whereas you and she's like homeless,
look at the ref like stopped and did 

3671
02:36:24,390 --> 02:36:24,760
that with vinny pazienza.
He looked over at the ref and he's like,

3672
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:25,920
come on man,
stop the fight.

3673
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:26,530
The referee said no.

3674
02:36:26,530 --> 02:36:29,950
He said okay,
and then he went and dropped him again.

3675
02:36:30,010 --> 02:36:31,410
You know,
and yeah,

3676
02:36:31,900 --> 02:36:35,170
didn't mean there's moments because I 
think an interesting thing when once you

3677
02:36:35,171 --> 02:36:37,390
lose your mojo,
man,

3678
02:36:37,391 --> 02:36:38,010
it's amazing,
isn't it?

3679
02:36:38,011 --> 02:36:40,300
Amazing.
Boy jones overnight went from like still

3680
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:42,100
doing amazing things and then he lost 
it.

3681
02:36:42,101 --> 02:36:44,140
He lost again and he lost.
It can go.

3682
02:36:44,260 --> 02:36:47,620
It's like once you stop believing in 
yourself as an athlete,

3683
02:36:47,621 --> 02:36:51,250
like you believe it is a lot to do with 
you believing you're indestructible.

3684
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:52,870
Once you see that chicken,
your own armor,

3685
02:36:52,871 --> 02:36:53,560
man,
getting that,

3686
02:36:54,550 --> 02:36:56,950
getting that energy back up to do it 
again must be really,

3687
02:36:56,951 --> 02:36:58,160
really hard.
Yeah,

3688
02:36:58,240 --> 02:37:03,240
I guarantee and there was a lot of other
factors involved in roy too because he 

3689
02:37:03,240 --> 02:37:07,141
went up to heAvyweight and then really 
how to dehydrate himself and we can 

3690
02:37:07,141 --> 02:37:11,880
absolve very badly getting back down the
light heavyweight again and then he got 

3691
02:37:11,880 --> 02:37:11,880
knocked out.

3692
02:37:11,880 --> 02:37:14,680
I mean he fought.
I'm Alan Johnson right now.

3693
02:37:14,681 --> 02:37:18,290
Glenn knocked him out after god dammit,
I can't believe harbor.

3694
02:37:18,410 --> 02:37:20,840
Yes.
Antonio tarver tarpon knocked him out.

3695
02:37:20,990 --> 02:37:25,990
Tara was the first guy to stop him and 
he did it in a fight where it was a 

3696
02:37:25,990 --> 02:37:26,720
rematch of a fight that they had that 
was very close,

3697
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:32,000
and then roy went up to heavyweight.
He box John Ruiz and beat him for the 

3698
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:35,771
title.
Then came down to light heavyweight and 

3699
02:37:35,771 --> 02:37:38,411
in losing that 25 pounds,
he really dehydrated the shit out of 

3700
02:37:38,411 --> 02:37:38,411
himself.
He looked terrible.

3701
02:37:38,510 --> 02:37:41,240
He looked like he had starved is he lost
all of his,

3702
02:37:41,241 --> 02:37:44,450
like his,
his like hardness to his muscles.

3703
02:37:44,480 --> 02:37:49,480
He looked terrible.
It was a really ugly weight cut and he 

3704
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:50,420
might've been done some shit to get up 
to heavyweight too.

3705
02:37:50,690 --> 02:37:52,730
That's possible.
And then you get off that shit.

3706
02:37:52,731 --> 02:37:54,080
Your hormone levels crash.

3707
02:37:54,110 --> 02:37:59,110
That's a speculation,
but the bottom line was tarver knocked 

3708
02:37:59,110 --> 02:38:02,501
him out and when tarver connected and 
carver was a big puncher and we 

3709
02:38:02,501 --> 02:38:02,900
connected and knocked them out,
roy was never the same.

3710
02:38:03,550 --> 02:38:06,340
Then the glen johnson fight with scary.
It's never the same.

3711
02:38:06,341 --> 02:38:11,341
It's just one day just happens.
It's Mike Tyson was never to say lennox 

3712
02:38:11,341 --> 02:38:11,341
lewis.
Yeah.

3713
02:38:11,341 --> 02:38:12,600
He was never the same necessarily after 
jail,

3714
02:38:12,601 --> 02:38:14,360
but he's still pretty ferocious.
They have to do well.

3715
02:38:14,361 --> 02:38:17,030
He tyson went to jail after he lost the 
title.

3716
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:22,120
Tyson and last and then went to jail and
came back was still fucking for 

3717
02:38:22,120 --> 02:38:25,340
ferocious.
The difference in like whAt happened 

3718
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:28,631
with roy's at roy fought again,
like within a certain amount of time it 

3719
02:38:28,631 --> 02:38:31,610
got knocked out really bad and when you 
get knocked out by a guy,

3720
02:38:31,611 --> 02:38:35,290
when you get your brain's scrambled like
it takes a long time for tea.

3721
02:38:35,290 --> 02:38:40,290
It looks like freddy roach is a genius 
and one of the things that he did 

3722
02:38:40,290 --> 02:38:41,930
brilliantly with manny pacquiao is after
pack y'all got knocked out.

3723
02:38:42,140 --> 02:38:45,710
He told him like,
you're not going to fight for a year.

3724
02:38:46,100 --> 02:38:51,100
He's like,
take your head out of this like there's 

3725
02:38:51,100 --> 02:38:51,100
no more.
We're gonna.

3726
02:38:51,100 --> 02:38:54,850
That was a bad knockout.
And freddy is a guy who suffers from a 

3727
02:38:54,850 --> 02:38:58,210
trauma related parkinson's himself.
He's got the shakes from his career in 

3728
02:38:58,210 --> 02:38:59,900
boxing and so because of that he's 
super,

3729
02:38:59,901 --> 02:39:01,850
super aware of damage and he's like,
look,

3730
02:39:01,851 --> 02:39:06,851
you could be okay,
but you got to heal up like there's no 

3731
02:39:06,851 --> 02:39:08,360
contact for a long time.
You're going to not fight for a year.

3732
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:10,580
And then he came back a year later and 
he looked great.

3733
02:39:11,300 --> 02:39:16,300
He looked like manny pacquiao and it's.
I think that rest time is super 

3734
02:39:16,300 --> 02:39:17,630
important.
That recuperation time.

3735
02:39:17,660 --> 02:39:22,660
It's very important when god gets 
knocked out and so we saw roy get beat 

3736
02:39:22,660 --> 02:39:26,441
by that guy or get beat by tarver and 
then beat again by johnson and a really 

3737
02:39:26,441 --> 02:39:26,441
scary way.

3738
02:39:26,441 --> 02:39:27,560
Yeah,
yeah.

3739
02:39:27,561 --> 02:39:29,150
That's what he went through the ropes.
Well,

3740
02:39:29,151 --> 02:39:32,490
he went down and back to his.
He banged his head off the ground and he

3741
02:39:32,491 --> 02:39:37,010
was stiff at the end of the fight.
Like he was like stiff in this weird,

3742
02:39:37,011 --> 02:39:42,011
scary way and it,
it didn't look like the kind of punch 

3743
02:39:42,011 --> 02:39:46,241
that would do that to you.
Like it didn't look like the kind of 

3744
02:39:46,241 --> 02:39:47,300
punch that would really put you in a 
catatonic state.

3745
02:39:47,301 --> 02:39:49,160
Like that was.
That was scary as shit man.

3746
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:52,490
It wAs also scared because Roy Jones,
you know,

3747
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:54,050
he used to be invincible.
Yeah,

3748
02:39:54,051 --> 02:39:56,130
that's what I mean.
Watching that haPpen to people is very,

3749
02:39:56,131 --> 02:39:57,160
you know,
watching like,

3750
02:39:57,240 --> 02:40:01,580
you know Michael Jordan number 45,
come back on the Washington wizards,

3751
02:40:01,581 --> 02:40:02,070
you know,
you're like,

3752
02:40:02,770 --> 02:40:05,300
well it's like watching Michael Jordan 
play baseball.

3753
02:40:05,960 --> 02:40:08,740
Yeah.
That was the first thing I get them in.

3754
02:40:08,810 --> 02:40:10,130
Yeah,
that was definitely the first thing.

3755
02:40:10,131 --> 02:40:15,131
But I mean,
but to come back because he came back 

3756
02:40:15,131 --> 02:40:15,131
and it was pretty great again,
but by the time he came back from

3757
02:40:15,131 --> 02:40:16,080
the wizards that one time it was like,
why?

3758
02:40:16,081 --> 02:40:18,780
Even like you never wanted to believe it
wouldn't be good anymore.

3759
02:40:18,810 --> 02:40:20,700
I never saw that.
I saw him.

3760
02:40:20,760 --> 02:40:22,470
He come back.
That was tough to watch.

3761
02:40:22,471 --> 02:40:27,471
I that with a being from philly iverson 
when he came back for like did like 16 

3762
02:40:27,471 --> 02:40:31,821
games before he left again.
And to have some weird situation where 

3763
02:40:31,821 --> 02:40:36,081
like when he gets to be 50,
he gets like some giant chunk of money 

3764
02:40:36,081 --> 02:40:36,081
apparently.
Yeah.

3765
02:40:36,081 --> 02:40:36,410
Either with a reebok.
Yes.

3766
02:40:36,411 --> 02:40:40,230
And kind of like the like trust or 
something a weird.

3767
02:40:40,470 --> 02:40:42,870
but he's broken out right now.
That's what they say.

3768
02:40:42,950 --> 02:40:44,460
At least that he was begging for money.
It will.

3769
02:40:44,461 --> 02:40:46,050
AS it turned out it was bullshit.
right?

3770
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:51,080
Wasn't that a bullshit story?
They're begging for and they just 

3771
02:40:51,080 --> 02:40:51,080
retired his number.
He looks fine,

3772
02:40:51,080 --> 02:40:51,080
you know,
like no,

3773
02:40:51,080 --> 02:40:55,400
somebody was.
Somebody was saying that he was outside 

3774
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:55,400
of a mall asking for money.

3775
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:59,360
But then I think that turned out to be 
like bullshit rumor that someone 

3776
02:40:59,360 --> 02:40:59,360
started.
Yeah,

3777
02:40:59,360 --> 02:41:02,960
that's absolutely.
I heard marilyn manson lives above a 

3778
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:04,280
liquor store here in la.
There's no might.

3779
02:41:04,530 --> 02:41:06,750
He might do that just to be a fucking 
crazy person.

3780
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:08,820
Marilyn manson is the real deal.
Dude.

3781
02:41:08,910 --> 02:41:13,910
Talk to stan stan.
Hope now he's moments my favorite rock 

3782
02:41:13,910 --> 02:41:14,040
star of all time.
do you know?

3783
02:41:14,041 --> 02:41:14,780
Stand up?
Yeah.

3784
02:41:14,781 --> 02:41:16,230
Yeah.
Do you need to talk to stan?

3785
02:41:16,231 --> 02:41:17,850
Hope about manson.
They hung out.

3786
02:41:17,910 --> 02:41:19,890
Oh good lord.
Really?

3787
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:21,720
Oh,
I don't want to say anything on the air.

3788
02:41:21,721 --> 02:41:24,360
It's not my place.
But go ask.

3789
02:41:24,390 --> 02:41:26,370
He's,
he's not playing games.

3790
02:41:26,371 --> 02:41:30,000
Sounds like an absence story that 
involves a lot of different things.

3791
02:41:30,690 --> 02:41:32,500
You need to hear it all from standing 
up.

3792
02:41:32,530 --> 02:41:37,530
I will look into that.
Mellon manson or talked to tate 

3793
02:41:37,530 --> 02:41:37,530
fletcher.
Fletcher's hung out with them too.

3794
02:41:37,530 --> 02:41:38,950
I've never met marilyn manson because 
uh,

3795
02:41:39,450 --> 02:41:41,310
for the same reason.
Every time I see dice,

3796
02:41:41,311 --> 02:41:42,690
I never really talked to him because I'm
like,

3797
02:41:42,691 --> 02:41:45,600
if this guy's a douche bag to me,
it's going to just destroy my thing.

3798
02:41:45,660 --> 02:41:50,660
Dice would be cool to you.
If you're a comic on bobby kelly's 

3799
02:41:50,660 --> 02:41:51,060
podcast,
they made me read it.

3800
02:41:51,090 --> 02:41:54,060
I wrote him.
I got stolen one night and just this is,

3801
02:41:54,750 --> 02:41:58,530
this should have happened 15 years ago,
not a year and a half ago.

3802
02:41:58,531 --> 02:42:01,770
I wrote him some faceBook.
He loved letter and the return thing was

3803
02:42:01,771 --> 02:42:02,580
like,
ah,

3804
02:42:02,600 --> 02:42:05,430
this is actually licensed assistant.
He doesn't really check it.

3805
02:42:07,140 --> 02:42:07,890
Yes.
Oh,

3806
02:42:07,900 --> 02:42:10,160
I gave them references to who to ask 
about me,

3807
02:42:10,210 --> 02:42:15,210
you know?
How long had you been doing comedy when 

3808
02:42:15,210 --> 02:42:17,880
you did that?
Fourteen years.

3809
02:42:20,150 --> 02:42:23,100
It was a year and a half ago.
I got stoned and I was like,

3810
02:42:23,130 --> 02:42:24,420
oh,
you know what it was.

3811
02:42:24,690 --> 02:42:27,300
I got stolen that I was listening to 
dice.

3812
02:42:27,301 --> 02:42:30,050
Man cometh and dice bank.
Come with whoa.

3813
02:42:30,090 --> 02:42:35,090
Look as a,
as a professional adult comic now doing 

3814
02:42:35,090 --> 02:42:35,090
it many years,
like I,

3815
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:37,170
I see the holes and everyone's game.
I'll wait.

3816
02:42:37,171 --> 02:42:37,890
You know what I mean?
Like I don't.

3817
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:41,580
There's no pedestal that I have mom,
except for the fact that dice when I was

3818
02:42:41,581 --> 02:42:42,720
younger,
I loved him.

3819
02:42:42,830 --> 02:42:46,050
It was my favorite thing in the world,
was part of the reason I would be funny.

3820
02:42:46,051 --> 02:42:51,051
Like I would go to school and recite 
dice lines and it was also a bonding 

3821
02:42:51,051 --> 02:42:55,131
thing that me and my step,
my step pup started dating my mom and 

3822
02:42:55,131 --> 02:42:56,490
staying over and everything like that.
Like he would let me watch dice,

3823
02:42:56,491 --> 02:42:58,020
like he brought that into my life.
That was our,

3824
02:42:58,021 --> 02:43:00,240
like our bonding thing that we both just
loved ice.

3825
02:43:00,570 --> 02:43:03,180
So now when I see him,
just one of those guys just like you,

3826
02:43:03,181 --> 02:43:06,570
that I just,
somehow we haven't crossed paths and uh,

3827
02:43:06,600 --> 02:43:07,890
I've seen him once them once in a while 
I'm like,

3828
02:43:07,891 --> 02:43:10,110
I'm to go talk to them and I just don't.
well,

3829
02:43:10,111 --> 02:43:11,770
if I'm ever around them and you're 
around them,

3830
02:43:11,771 --> 02:43:12,310
I'll introduce

3831
02:43:12,310 --> 02:43:12,970
you.
he's great.

3832
02:43:13,150 --> 02:43:15,030
He's fun and he's been on the podcast a 
bunch of time.

3833
02:43:15,070 --> 02:43:16,170
He's been great on the puck.
Yeah.

3834
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:19,880
I hung out with him in norton and 
anthony and uh,

3835
02:43:19,900 --> 02:43:23,710
it was as a bunch of us and brian and 
who else was with us was Bobby Kelly?

3836
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:24,610
No,
it wasn't Bobby Kelly.

3837
02:43:25,350 --> 02:43:26,040
Kelly.
Yeah.

3838
02:43:26,050 --> 02:43:27,330
Bobby kelly was there too.
Yeah.

3839
02:43:27,580 --> 02:43:30,730
And we all saw him.
We went to his show and uh,

3840
02:43:30,760 --> 02:43:33,180
in vegas at the riviera.
Nice.

3841
02:43:33,190 --> 02:43:36,850
Which is the classic venue place I've 
ever played.

3842
02:43:36,940 --> 02:43:38,980
Hasn't changed since 1970.
I mean,

3843
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:41,260
they haven't done a goddamn thing.
They've washed the floor.

3844
02:43:41,261 --> 02:43:42,490
That's it.
At the comedy club?

3845
02:43:42,670 --> 02:43:47,670
Yeah.
The upstairs right across from the 

3846
02:43:47,670 --> 02:43:47,670
dancing girls shows that the above 
thing.

3847
02:43:47,670 --> 02:43:52,020
Theater.
They used to have the frank marino drag 

3848
02:43:52,020 --> 02:43:52,020
show in drag queen show.
Did you ever see that?

3849
02:43:52,020 --> 02:43:52,440
No.
Oh,

3850
02:43:52,470 --> 02:43:54,200
it was great.
He's like,

3851
02:43:54,220 --> 02:43:55,360
the lady is a queen.

3852
02:43:55,390 --> 02:44:00,390
I think like he has like a,
like a book out about being a cross 

3853
02:44:00,390 --> 02:44:01,740
dresser.
He's do a whole show where he would like

3854
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:05,230
cross dress this guy and he's like a 
famous crossdresser for vegas.

3855
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:10,440
Like one of those guys were like,
you really didn't see him or hear about 

3856
02:44:10,440 --> 02:44:13,841
them anywhere else.
But If you're in vegas like frank 

3857
02:44:13,841 --> 02:44:13,900
marino,
you'd see his name on these calves,

3858
02:44:13,901 --> 02:44:16,990
like the little triangle that sits on 
top of the cab.

3859
02:44:17,020 --> 02:44:19,540
You know what I'm talking about?
That the little billboard they have that

3860
02:44:19,541 --> 02:44:24,541
they ran out and uh,
so dice had that room was like the 

3861
02:44:24,541 --> 02:44:26,920
upstairs room.
It's a larger room and we went to see it

3862
02:44:26,950 --> 02:44:31,950
were howling like little school children
and then the after it was over we were 

3863
02:44:31,950 --> 02:44:32,920
hanging out backstage and I was like,
holy shit.

3864
02:44:32,921 --> 02:44:37,921
I'm backstage with dice.
Like I was thinking about like being a 

3865
02:44:37,921 --> 02:44:38,470
kid and listening to his.
It was a cassette.

3866
02:44:38,620 --> 02:44:41,830
Yeah.
My rules was just dice.

3867
02:44:41,831 --> 02:44:44,870
I think the first one was just dice,
you know,

3868
02:44:44,890 --> 02:44:46,390
and I was listening to it.
This girl I was dating,

3869
02:44:46,391 --> 02:44:47,980
we were crying,
laughing.

3870
02:44:47,981 --> 02:44:52,630
We thought it was so funny because back 
then it was like so shocking what he was

3871
02:44:52,631 --> 02:44:53,200
saying.

3872
02:44:53,370 --> 02:44:55,810
Anytime time someone dismisses dice,
I always go,

3873
02:44:56,780 --> 02:44:58,430
he goes,
he's having a hard time making friends.

3874
02:44:58,460 --> 02:45:00,680
So I go to see the psycho therapist and 
I'm like,

3875
02:45:00,681 --> 02:45:03,710
hey doc,
I'm having a hard time making friends.

3876
02:45:03,711 --> 02:45:08,710
You fucking cock sucker.
Like if you told me that's not funny,

3877
02:45:08,750 --> 02:45:10,400
you just don't know what's funny.
That's funny.

3878
02:45:11,090 --> 02:45:12,050
Well,
he,

3879
02:45:12,260 --> 02:45:17,260
you know,
if you know his story that that dice 

3880
02:45:17,260 --> 02:45:17,260
part was a character.
Yep.

3881
02:45:17,260 --> 02:45:17,410
Oh yeah.
No,

3882
02:45:17,720 --> 02:45:22,720
I mean just from being a fan,
but I heard him on your thing to tell 

3883
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:22,720
the whole story and everything,
but it's weird.

3884
02:45:22,730 --> 02:45:27,730
It's weird that he acknowledges that 
being a character and still in a weird 

3885
02:45:27,730 --> 02:45:28,490
way chooses to live as the character.
He likes it.

3886
02:45:28,520 --> 02:45:31,120
He likes being.
That guy looks were in wrestling sort of

3887
02:45:31,121 --> 02:45:34,190
a fucking joey.
Joey buttafuoco sweatshirts and shit.

3888
02:45:34,260 --> 02:45:36,200
He was the cut weightlifting gloves.

3889
02:45:36,230 --> 02:45:41,230
Oh,
you're could do flashdance flashdance 

3890
02:45:41,230 --> 02:45:43,100
shirts used to wear the gold's gym 
jacket everywhere.

3891
02:45:43,190 --> 02:45:45,580
It's great.
The way he came out on that,

3892
02:45:45,581 --> 02:45:47,090
uh,
the one he did in the round.

3893
02:45:47,300 --> 02:45:49,180
The special.
Yeah.

3894
02:45:49,240 --> 02:45:52,700
Was just the headband with the big 
feather,

3895
02:45:52,701 --> 02:45:55,190
like staying alive hair.
Will you ever hear him talking about how

3896
02:45:55,191 --> 02:45:57,530
he tried to move back to brooklyn to.
Oh,

3897
02:45:57,531 --> 02:45:59,620
it's hilarious.
Yeah.

3898
02:45:59,750 --> 02:46:01,580
He just tried to move back with those 
animals.

3899
02:46:01,610 --> 02:46:04,070
Don't like,
like after he became the dice man,

3900
02:46:04,071 --> 02:46:05,540
I'm going to go back to the 
neighborhood,

3901
02:46:06,830 --> 02:46:11,800
get put up a fence and hide behind me.
He can't.

3902
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:13,700
It's the same hanging around with those 
people.

3903
02:46:13,730 --> 02:46:18,730
It's an interesting.
I'd be curious to find out if larry the 

3904
02:46:18,730 --> 02:46:18,950
cable guy,
like he's like,

3905
02:46:18,951 --> 02:46:19,800
hey,
hey babe,

3906
02:46:19,801 --> 02:46:21,410
I gotta run to the hardware store or 
whatever.

3907
02:46:21,411 --> 02:46:22,460
You know,
I'm sure it doesn't do that,

3908
02:46:22,461 --> 02:46:27,461
but whatever I have to go out for,
if he has to go throw in like a 

3909
02:46:27,461 --> 02:46:27,461
sleeveless flannel shirt,
he can go back.

3910
02:46:27,461 --> 02:46:32,320
I mean he's like a tucked in shirt guy.
Well he that is a complete and total dan

3911
02:46:32,781 --> 02:46:34,800
whitney.
But does he,

3912
02:46:35,340 --> 02:46:37,370
I mean he did.
He almost committed to living his life.

3913
02:46:37,371 --> 02:46:39,890
Now is larry the cable guy?
He sort of passed the test too.

3914
02:46:39,950 --> 02:46:43,340
I mean if he ever went out as dan 
whitney or did an interview on the view,

3915
02:46:43,341 --> 02:46:48,050
he's one of the few real characters in 
standup was like if he went on the view.

3916
02:46:48,110 --> 02:46:52,010
I don't know why I keep saying the view.
If you went on the jimmy fallon show,

3917
02:46:52,400 --> 02:46:55,100
the tonight show and he went on his dan 
whitney,

3918
02:46:55,130 --> 02:46:57,020
it would probably blow his whole fucking
thIng.

3919
02:46:57,230 --> 02:46:59,090
Well,
it isn't that what happened when you can

3920
02:46:59,091 --> 02:47:04,091
almost pinpoint the change in diocese 
career trajectory was when he cried in 

3921
02:47:04,101 --> 02:47:06,020
our centennial hall.
He humanized himself too much,

3922
02:47:06,021 --> 02:47:08,240
whIch some people probably thought it 
was a cool thing,

3923
02:47:08,241 --> 02:47:09,550
but when he cried about like,
you know,

3924
02:47:09,590 --> 02:47:11,260
dice man supposed to come out and be 
like,

3925
02:47:11,270 --> 02:47:16,270
you know,
they were taking a movie out of the 

3926
02:47:16,270 --> 02:47:16,270
theater that was as beef and he got 
teary eyed,

3927
02:47:16,270 --> 02:47:17,330
but if before he sees,
you know,

3928
02:47:17,480 --> 02:47:20,810
dice is supposed to come out and be like
fuck you don't see my movie.

3929
02:47:20,810 --> 02:47:25,810
Huge watts.
But he cried or sydney hall and it was 

3930
02:47:25,810 --> 02:47:26,630
real.
It was a genuine moment and that's just,

3931
02:47:26,660 --> 02:47:28,400
you know,
that's not who he is.

3932
02:47:28,401 --> 02:47:31,160
But I think he was also under some 
insane pressure.

3933
02:47:31,161 --> 02:47:33,470
Like if you don't remember what it was 
like back then,

3934
02:47:33,530 --> 02:47:38,530
like there was so many people that were 
angry to meet me and he had like some 

3935
02:47:38,530 --> 02:47:39,260
hateful comedy.
Yeah,

3936
02:47:39,670 --> 02:47:43,670
lIke the things that he was making,
like the way he was making fun of it.

3937
02:47:43,671 --> 02:47:47,390
It's like if you go back and listen to 
like eddie murphy raw,

3938
02:47:47,480 --> 02:47:49,280
if you go back and see some of the gay 
stuff,

3939
02:47:49,490 --> 02:47:52,580
like it was like really aggressively 
anti gay,

3940
02:47:52,620 --> 02:47:56,660
like the comic strip in New York.
I've told us on so many radio shows,

3941
02:47:56,661 --> 02:48:01,661
but it does make me laugh that how 
things have changed and no one comes 

3942
02:48:01,661 --> 02:48:01,790
down with eddie murphy ever for this 
stuff,

3943
02:48:01,791 --> 02:48:06,791
but they have to have is gold albums on 
the wall and the first one track for 

3944
02:48:06,791 --> 02:48:11,710
just called faggots and then track one 
on the next album is causa says faggots 

3945
02:48:13,221 --> 02:48:18,221
and then parentheses says revisited that
we didn't cover it all in the first go 

3946
02:48:18,501 --> 02:48:18,950
around.

3947
02:48:20,070 --> 02:48:25,070
Well it's in that way like social 
justice warriors as it were a kind of 

3948
02:48:25,491 --> 02:48:30,491
important because that's the only reason
why a lot of thIs change has taken 

3949
02:48:30,491 --> 02:48:32,180
places because of how outraged people 
got.

3950
02:48:32,480 --> 02:48:35,420
Like if people just kept quiet about it 
back then.

3951
02:48:35,780 --> 02:48:40,340
So in a way like a lot of the,
the old like taking it too far,

3952
02:48:40,400 --> 02:48:42,980
like sort of bounces back and it has a 
healthy middle.

3953
02:48:43,280 --> 02:48:48,280
You know what I mean?
Like in some ways like there's always 

3954
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:50,411
going to be like the far left,
but in a lot of ways the far left 

3955
02:48:50,411 --> 02:48:51,200
tempers the far right.
It's like,

3956
02:48:51,201 --> 02:48:53,620
because like the standard,
it'd be,

3957
02:48:53,660 --> 02:48:55,040
it changes,
it moves back and forth,

3958
02:48:55,041 --> 02:48:57,610
like if you,
if you let people go and,

3959
02:48:57,650 --> 02:49:02,650
and you know,
be as racist and homophobic and as 

3960
02:49:02,650 --> 02:49:04,460
hateful as they want and don't do 
anything about it.

3961
02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:07,040
They kind of never realized that where 
they're doing it shitty.

3962
02:49:07,440 --> 02:49:08,010
But because of

3963
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:10,470
the blowback,
like dice all that crying and everything

3964
02:49:10,471 --> 02:49:15,471
that he did,
that's probably a direct result of 

3965
02:49:15,471 --> 02:49:15,471
blowback.
Like he's probably like,

3966
02:49:15,471 --> 02:49:16,810
he was constantly experiencing people 
that were protesting.

3967
02:49:16,820 --> 02:49:19,680
Remember he got kicked off of mt for,
for lIfe.

3968
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:23,130
And I remember kurt loder saying about 
how unfunny it was,

3969
02:49:23,131 --> 02:49:25,500
and this is not like unfunny to who to 
you.

3970
02:49:25,650 --> 02:49:30,650
Okay.
I guarantee you if he did that late 

3971
02:49:30,650 --> 02:49:30,650
night at the comedy store,
he would fucking crush.

3972
02:49:30,650 --> 02:49:34,610
So like,
are you recognizing this as a character 

3973
02:49:34,610 --> 02:49:37,611
or do you think there's a real person 
who's saying these real things and you 

3974
02:49:37,611 --> 02:49:39,870
don't think there's any comedy in this,
this play that he's putting on,

3975
02:49:39,871 --> 02:49:43,860
which is essentially he's pretending to 
be this soulful guy.

3976
02:49:43,890 --> 02:49:46,770
Oh,
you cock sucker like this.

3977
02:49:46,780 --> 02:49:48,550
He's going to fuck a guy's chicken in 
front of them.

3978
02:49:49,980 --> 02:49:51,810
It's obvious that he doesn't really 
mean.

3979
02:49:51,830 --> 02:49:53,730
I mean it's like five minutes left.
So he's doing.

3980
02:49:53,910 --> 02:49:57,360
There's some craziness to it is.
I mean it's a character.

3981
02:49:57,480 --> 02:49:58,470
I mean,
is that,

3982
02:49:58,740 --> 02:50:03,740
is there a difference between that 
character in the bad guy character in a 

3983
02:50:03,740 --> 02:50:06,831
movie where the guy's going to run 
around killing people or raping people 

3984
02:50:06,831 --> 02:50:08,670
or is there a difference?
I mean it is just fiction.

3985
02:50:08,850 --> 02:50:13,850
Like how come we don't hold the actor 
responsible because the actor didn't 

3986
02:50:13,850 --> 02:50:15,060
write it.
If he wrote it and he wanted to be,

3987
02:50:15,061 --> 02:50:16,770
the bad guy would be.
We'd be upset at them.

3988
02:50:16,771 --> 02:50:19,740
No,
it's like for that kind of comedy,

3989
02:50:19,830 --> 02:50:20,760
but I mean,
but there's also,

3990
02:50:20,761 --> 02:50:25,761
you don't have to do a character to say.
I feel like I feel like the entire 

3991
02:50:25,761 --> 02:50:28,140
disclaimer of everything goes to,
like I said earlier,

3992
02:50:28,141 --> 02:50:30,300
it's like there's a laughing microphone 
behind you on a wall.

3993
02:50:30,301 --> 02:50:31,020
Like we're not.

3994
02:50:31,300 --> 02:50:32,880
You know what I mean?
Like I'm not addressing,

3995
02:50:33,930 --> 02:50:36,030
you know,
the state of the state of the union.

3996
02:50:36,031 --> 02:50:37,890
You know what I mean?
Like I'm up here telling you like,

3997
02:50:37,900 --> 02:50:40,650
it's clearly.
That was always my thing about,

3998
02:50:40,651 --> 02:50:41,730
uh,
with the taj,

3999
02:50:41,731 --> 02:50:42,930
the lady getting so mad.
It's like,

4000
02:50:42,931 --> 02:50:47,931
do you believe for one split second that
daniel tosh is pro rape and as slipped 

4001
02:50:48,151 --> 02:50:50,730
through the cracks to find himself 
massive television success?

4002
02:50:50,940 --> 02:50:52,560
do you believe that?
That doesn't happen?

4003
02:50:52,800 --> 02:50:54,870
It doesn't happen.
That would have reared its head before.

4004
02:50:54,900 --> 02:50:59,900
It's not what they're saying.
What they're saying is they found a 

4005
02:50:59,900 --> 02:51:02,680
green light.
They found a green light to be outraged 

4006
02:51:02,680 --> 02:51:02,970
and you know,
also some people way more sensitive than

4007
02:51:02,971 --> 02:51:03,570
others,
you know,

4008
02:51:03,590 --> 02:51:05,300
being called out in front of all those 
people have.

4009
02:51:05,301 --> 02:51:09,780
And everybody laugh aT what he said to 
her probably sucked for her.

4010
02:51:10,230 --> 02:51:13,740
She decided that she was,
for whatever reason,

4011
02:51:14,040 --> 02:51:19,040
she was justified and proving our point 
or making her point or expressing 

4012
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:19,210
herself,
which you know,

4013
02:51:19,211 --> 02:51:20,340
you should be allowed to express 
yourself,

4014
02:51:20,341 --> 02:51:22,410
but the idea that he's supposed to 
apologize for that.

4015
02:51:22,411 --> 02:51:27,411
Like if you look at what it was on paper
and then they hear comics agreeing with 

4016
02:51:27,411 --> 02:51:27,800
them,
that was just disappointing.

4017
02:51:27,820 --> 02:51:31,050
But your outrageous supposed to come at 
like oppression,

4018
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:36,140
injustice,
whatever semester you're supposed to 

4019
02:51:36,140 --> 02:51:36,140
like rage against the art.
You know what I mean?

4020
02:51:36,140 --> 02:51:39,951
Like in a clear,
the creatives fucking around situation 

4021
02:51:39,951 --> 02:51:41,490
where someone's just fucking around.
IT's clear he's adlibbing.

4022
02:51:41,520 --> 02:51:45,840
This is not a thought out piece.
You know where he's advocating a woman,

4023
02:51:45,841 --> 02:51:49,290
a random woman getting raped for no 
reason other than the klan rallies.

4024
02:51:49,291 --> 02:51:50,000
What I'm saying,
it's there.

4025
02:51:50,170 --> 02:51:52,290
You're in an environment.
If this is what it is,

4026
02:51:52,770 --> 02:51:53,590
well you know what man?

4027
02:51:53,650 --> 02:51:56,070
Some people be really happy if everybody
was exactly like them.

4028
02:51:56,580 --> 02:51:59,310
If everybody had the same sensibilities,
sensibilities,

4029
02:51:59,340 --> 02:52:04,340
sensitivities,
and everybody had the same ideas about 

4030
02:52:04,340 --> 02:52:04,340
what's important to talk about,
what you can't talk about,

4031
02:52:04,340 --> 02:52:06,220
what's taboo,
what's okay.

4032
02:52:06,970 --> 02:52:11,970
You know,
there's plenty of people out there that 

4033
02:52:11,970 --> 02:52:12,790
agree and disagree and they're fucking 
going at it back and forth.

4034
02:52:13,060 --> 02:52:18,060
That's what's fascinating.
That's fascinating about trying to find 

4035
02:52:18,060 --> 02:52:19,060
out where's the middle ground,
like how much of it is me being crazy?

4036
02:52:19,061 --> 02:52:24,061
How much of it is me just tapping into 
one mindset with whatever thing you 

4037
02:52:24,061 --> 02:52:28,231
support or disagree with anything,
whether it's the style of comedy that 

4038
02:52:28,231 --> 02:52:30,250
people do or the kind of music that 
people are into.

4039
02:52:30,550 --> 02:52:35,550
Some fucking kid got arrested because he
took some lyrics to a song and put it 

4040
02:52:35,550 --> 02:52:40,531
up,
put the lyrIcs up as a tweet and they 

4041
02:52:40,531 --> 02:52:40,531
arrested him because it was like some 
fucking crazy.

4042
02:52:40,531 --> 02:52:42,130
You're right.
Some song about school shootings.

4043
02:52:42,580 --> 02:52:47,580
Oh,
it was going to say it wasn't for like 

4044
02:52:47,580 --> 02:52:47,580
the actual copyright of the song.
You're saying?

4045
02:52:47,580 --> 02:52:47,580
No,
no,

4046
02:52:47,580 --> 02:52:47,580
no,
he.

4047
02:52:47,580 --> 02:52:52,070
They came.
They arrested him because he tweeted 

4048
02:52:52,070 --> 02:52:52,750
some in the band.
I forget what the show's almost over.

4049
02:52:52,990 --> 02:52:55,540
I forget what the band's name was that 
came to his defense,

4050
02:52:55,541 --> 02:52:57,160
but they're like,
this is the lyrics to a song.

4051
02:52:57,161 --> 02:52:59,980
It's like an anti school shooting song,
you know,

4052
02:52:59,990 --> 02:53:03,580
but it's like talking about like where 
this all comes from the rate.

4053
02:53:03,581 --> 02:53:05,380
I don't know if it's an anti schools 
shooting song,

4054
02:53:05,381 --> 02:53:08,830
but it's just a song and it's coming 
from like the rage of like where,

4055
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:10,120
where,
where's this guy feeling?

4056
02:53:10,121 --> 02:53:12,190
what is this guy doing?
This guy tweeted this.

4057
02:53:12,430 --> 02:53:16,000
These lyrics,
like if you tweet something from a movie

4058
02:53:16,060 --> 02:53:18,740
about like kill them all,
let god sort about like,

4059
02:53:18,760 --> 02:53:20,410
does that mean I'm going to go out and 
kill people?

4060
02:53:20,410 --> 02:53:23,320
I mean gus van sant and made a hole 
basically a columbine movie.

4061
02:53:23,590 --> 02:53:24,340
Yeah,
right.

4062
02:53:24,450 --> 02:53:26,080
Do.
If I remember he did that movie though.

4063
02:53:26,470 --> 02:53:29,560
we added in for some reason was before 
they went to do the murder,

4064
02:53:29,561 --> 02:53:34,510
they just got in the shower together and
made our elephant.

4065
02:53:35,530 --> 02:53:37,570
He just added that in there before they 
went to go shoot.

4066
02:53:37,740 --> 02:53:42,740
It was all the same thing like filming 
themselves and planning the whole thing 

4067
02:53:42,740 --> 02:53:45,601
for weeks and getting the guns together 
and then right before school that 

4068
02:53:45,601 --> 02:53:46,780
morning they just hopped in the shower 
and started making out the two dudes.

4069
02:53:47,980 --> 02:53:49,750
Nothing about that ever in the real 
story.

4070
02:53:49,751 --> 02:53:50,680
That was how he made it.
Like,

4071
02:53:50,681 --> 02:53:51,520
you know,
oh no,

4072
02:53:51,521 --> 02:53:56,521
this isn't the columbIne story these 
kids were making out in the shower 

4073
02:53:56,521 --> 02:53:56,521
first.
Wow.

4074
02:53:56,521 --> 02:53:59,020
That's pretty clever of him.
And on that note,

4075
02:53:59,230 --> 02:54:00,970
big jay oakerson.
Thank you very much brother.

4076
02:54:00,970 --> 02:54:03,940
There's a lot of.
I think we could do like 180 days.

4077
02:54:04,030 --> 02:54:04,570
Okay.
Well,

4078
02:54:04,650 --> 02:54:05,940
you know,
anytime I come out at all.

4079
02:54:06,010 --> 02:54:07,300
Anytime.
How often are you out here?

4080
02:54:07,810 --> 02:54:09,730
I'm trying to come out more.
I'm checking them out like three times a

4081
02:54:09,731 --> 02:54:10,780
year at least.
Beautiful.

4082
02:54:10,781 --> 02:54:15,781
And you're on ari shapiro storyteller 
show that's online and you're doing the 

4083
02:54:15,781 --> 02:54:16,720
weather like during the one for tv 
tonight,

4084
02:54:16,790 --> 02:54:20,680
so I think there's probably some tickets
available or he was upset that they were

4085
02:54:20,681 --> 02:54:23,050
in moving quick enough.
People just didn't know about it,

4086
02:54:23,051 --> 02:54:28,051
but they're available for free.
