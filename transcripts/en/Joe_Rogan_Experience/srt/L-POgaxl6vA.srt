1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,350
Uh,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,300
you freaked bitches.
We're back at it again.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,910
I thank the baby Jesus.
I worked my fucking volumes on.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,300
Of course.
I've only been doing this for three 

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:17,300
years through a laptop.
Some low tech Shit's not gonna.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,350
Look at a circuit board that I don't 
understand.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,160
It's a simple stupid fucking mute button
and I never push it.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,880
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is what does a professional 

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:28,880
mean?
That's like as professionals,

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,740
I get sort of kind of like the fake 
professional voice,

11
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:32,970
but not really.
Um,

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,310
what brought to you by taking A.
I had a dude on my message board that 

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,100
always on the mixed martial arts,
a message board that said that he went 

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,291
from a 90 something dollar verizon bill 
to an $18 bill with the same use.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,690
If that's true.
That is true.

16
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:50,760
And I'm,
I'm paraphrasing the numbers.

17
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:51,830
I don't remember the exact numbers.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,760
I should probably look it up.
I would say that that's.

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,740
He barely uses this phone if that's 
true.

20
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,940
Well,
I don't know man.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,930
You know,
he said was it,

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,640
was it the same use?
Um,

23
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,560
I don't know.
I don't know how much you would save,

24
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:06,561
but I know that I've gotten so much 
positive feedback about Tang and joey's 

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,690
been a loyal sprint customer forever.
10 uses the sprint backbone with ting is

26
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:13,230
is a,
it's a cell phone company.

27
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,280
The way they do is essentially they by 
cell phone time at a,

28
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,090
um,
at,

29
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,350
at sprint and they sell it to you.
They sell it back to you,

30
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,620
but they do it with no contracts and 
they sell like the coolest android 

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,911
phones that they have.
Which part of the way did you just see 

32
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:32,070
this new fucking thing that they're 
going to release the facebook phone?

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,280
No,
the Samsung is going to release 

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,300
something called the Galaxy Mega.
No.

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,580
Holy Shit,
dude.

36
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:42,120
It's six inches.
It's like there's two versions of it.

37
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:45,480
There's a five point eight inch and a 
six point three inch.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,910
Like what the fuck are you talking 
about?

39
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:50,100
That's not a phone.
What am I going to do it?

40
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:50,980
That's,
that's,

41
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,330
that's a half of Joey Diaz.
Dick wanting to fit in your pocket.

42
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:54,990
We'll,
I can't.

43
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,910
I don't know.
It's nonsense.

44
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,520
That's a crazy thing.
I don't know what that is.

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,700
I don't know what that is.
That's some cross crossover world thing 

46
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,120
that you have to have a man purse to 
carry that around.

47
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,960
Or a woman and woman would be excellent.
If I was a girl and I had a bag,

48
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,670
you know,
girls are allowed to carry purses,

49
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:13,500
which is so awesome.
You know,

50
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,680
there's one thing they have got us 
whipped with this society,

51
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:18,810
not women,
but society has got us whipped with this

52
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:22,560
stupid idea that somehow or another a 
man is not allowed to carry a purse.

53
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,480
You know,
back in the Robin Hood days,

54
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,880
those motherfuckers had shoulder bags.
Okay.

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,400
You're allowed to wear a backpack.
A backpack.

56
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:34,230
Like I'm a fucking schoolkid.
Nobody gives me a hard time with it,

57
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,020
but if I wear a fanny pack,
they will look at me like somewhere.

58
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,080
God Damn freaking nature.
I'll tell you folks,

59
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:45,081
we got to take back the fanny pack.
We're going to take back the fanny pack 

60
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:45,180
and maybe even introduce a fucking 
purse.

61
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,840
How about them apples?
Get yourself a purse,

62
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,520
boys.
Fuck it.

63
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,080
Yeah,
you got a little man purse.

64
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,920
There's nothing wrong with that man.
The idea that there's something somehow 

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,040
or another feminine or weak about 
carrying around

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,450
a bag is a perplexing aspect of this 
society.

67
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,030
Ladies and gentlemen,
it doesn't make any sense.

68
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,750
We are allowed to carry certain bags.
If you're carrying like a military style

69
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,670
Duffel bag,
that's fine,

70
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,060
but you're not allowed to have a purse.
You can't go through the airport with a 

71
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,060
purse.
Dudes will laugh at you.

72
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,190
Dudes with backpacks carrying duffle 
bags will laugh at you.

73
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,100
If you've got a purse,
we'll give you a scar,

74
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:25,240
but it's fucking purse.
What is that?

75
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,290
A purse,
Bro.

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,010
You got to fucking put that difference 
between the fucking person.

77
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,410
A backpack.
What's going on here?

78
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,640
Come on,
man.

79
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,260
A duffel bags.
Okay,

80
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:38,470
and I can't have a fucking purse.
This is nonsense.

81
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,340
We have subjected ourselves to some 
nonsense that we just have accepted over

82
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:45,800
the years and now it's become culture.
Brian Redbank.

83
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,150
God bless you for breaking the mold.
Young man guys.

84
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,370
Zantax keeps your Zantac.
What is that context?

85
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,650
Is that hurt from drinking too much?
Heartburn?

86
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,080
Medicine.
You take heartburn.

87
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,020
Medicine?
Yeah.

88
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,370
Oh Dude.
Silly Bitch.

89
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,270
I'm anyway tank.
What Tim does is it allows you to,

90
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,410
uh,
first of all,

91
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,020
if you go to Rogan.ting.com,
you could save some money,

92
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:13,021
save 25 bucks off their service,
but what they allow you to do is buy 

93
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:15,000
phones,
the highest end android phones and uh,

94
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,680
and put it on a network,
the sprint network,

95
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,590
but cancel whatever the fuck you want.
It's yours.

96
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:25,591
It's your phone too.
There's a lot of stupid shit that goes 

97
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:26,760
along with the cell phone contracts.
And uh,

98
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,980
one,
one big one is the fact that if you,

99
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,550
you know,
you,

100
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:32,800
most people don't realize what kind of 
deal they're making when they make it.

101
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:35,110
But when you cancel,
if you cancel you,

102
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,250
you got to pay them.

103
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,670
You can't just quit because you owe them
like hundreds of dollars.

104
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,260
It gets,
it gets fucking stupid.

105
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,410
And if someone is in a position where 
$300 is like a make or break for the 

106
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,350
month for them and you really want to 
get out of your,

107
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:49,130
you know,
x cell phone,

108
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,320
you know,
eight and t,

109
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:55,321
whether it's verizon,
whenever it is you to fucking pain up 

110
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:58,680
you,
you didn't really get the deal that you 

111
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,900
got is you're paying off that phone over
a several year period or you know,

112
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,540
over a certain amount of time period and
they sort of add that to your bill.

113
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,710
So if you just decide to leave,
you didn't really get that phone for two

114
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,750
99.
You got a $700 phone for to 99 because 

115
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,200
they worked it into your deal that you 
pay the rest of it over time.

116
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,430
So that's what's going on.

117
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,000
That's why you can't just cancel and 
things like what kinds of stupid shit is

118
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,650
out.
Let's just cut that out of the equation.

119
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,350
That's nonsense.
This complicates things.

120
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,260
Let's also have it so people can share 
time and then spray it with.

121
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,940
One of the coolest things about using 
the sprint network is it's not like Tang

122
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,390
has its own little funky network that 
only works and like weird spots.

123
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,080
It's a,
it's a huge network that works 

124
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,080
everywhere and the waiting has it set 
up.

125
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,660
If you don't use all of their,
all of their bandwidth.

126
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:46,510
If you don't use all of their,
you know,

127
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:50,170
all of the time,
rather they'll give you a credit on your

128
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:55,171
unused service,
so if you use less than you thought you 

129
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:58,741
would,
tear drops you down and credit you the 

130
00:05:58,741 --> 00:05:59,790
difference on your next bill.
It's beautiful.

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,890
I love it.
It's just a cool company.

132
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,580
I love the idea behind it.
It would suck if it turned out they were

133
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:09,180
actually evil and that they just like 
the most evil company ever.

134
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:10,140
They're just doing it really

135
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,610
like a puppy.
Yeah.

136
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,780
They're all fucking devil worshipers or 
some shit.

137
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,170
I've seen the pictures of you and your 
six,

138
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,540
six,
six and your tattoo.

139
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,930
Yeah,
we gotta talk about that picture.

140
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:23,460
Huh?
People think I'm a real devil.

141
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:28,461
Worship really silly fox.
I was at the Goddamn some Anton lavey 

142
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:28,500
thing.
We'll talk about it.

143
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,730
Okay,
we'll talk about it.

144
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,060
Pull the picture up.
We'll talk about it because it's so 

145
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,060
ridiculous.
Anyway,

146
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,290
Rogan Dot Tang.com.
Save yourself some money on a cool 

147
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:39,290
company.
And uh,

148
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:39,930
you know,
uh,

149
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,090
I don't think there's any reason to have

that,
uh,

159
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,500
Brian uses it.
It's a,

160
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:07,770
it's an easy way to,
if you have a small business and going,

161
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,830
taking your stuff,
whatever you're selling and bringing it 

162
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,130
to some post office where you've got to 
wait in line,

163
00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:16,590
someone's going to weigh your shit and 
box everything out.

164
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,270
It's a pain in the Dick and it's not 
necessary.

165
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,190
Um,
and stamps.com

166
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,620
do it all.
They give you a scale,

167
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,570
um,
they,

168
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,690
they,
they set you up,

169
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,760
you,
you print out the postage on your 

170
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:32,760
computer.
I mean it's,

171
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,620
it's a beautiful seamless experience.
And Brian,

172
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,490
you enjoy it,
right?

173
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Yeah,
it's super easy and it's just not going 

174
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:40,760
to the post office is the biggest thing 
because going to the post office,

175
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,290
I don't know how it is where you guys 
live,

176
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,980
but in,
in Burbank it's like an hour just to get

177
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,190
to the cashier.
She can give him your box of tons of 

178
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,830
stuff to send and it's a pain in the ass
here.

179
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:53,420
You just printed out and they have like,
you know,

180
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:58,421
different ways to print it out.
They have like the sticker kind where 

181
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:01,331
you can print it on these stickers and 
the print outs just like it's a regular 

182
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:02,450
stamp or you could just put your 
envelope in there and a printed right on

183
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:03,340
the envelope.
I mean,

184
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,740
ups.
Yeah.

185
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,440
No,
no,

186
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:06,110
not ups.

187
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,010
Oh,
so you can imagine that's it.

188
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,270
Not to take it to the box.
Do you remember they came up,

189
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,650
everybody knows that they're the biggest
drug dealer.

190
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,070
Mitch Hedberg is job.
No,

191
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:22,480
but that's a true story now,
which become.

192
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,500
That's how fucking insightful he was.
That's the truth.

193
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:27,810
I think they're getting all this weed.
Anywhere you go.

194
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:30,090
Now we've got Kelly wheat.
It's not really Kelly.

195
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:31,950
We'd people that buy it.
They got.

196
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,970
They got a good salesman.
I wonder if it's the same chance or 

197
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,890
taken that you've taken with the post 
office because the post office,

198
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:40,410
if you're like a drug dealer and you 
sent drugs through the mail,

199
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,450
you don't think it's like a federal 
massive with Tommy Chunk,

200
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,070
but it's.
Yeah,

201
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,690
but is it the same with ups?

202
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,360
No,
I don't think they're.

203
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,350
I think ups has a private company.

204
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,660
You're still doing something over state 
lines,

205
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,930
so are still transporting.
You're still going to jail.

206
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,050
Transporting across state lines is one 
issue,

207
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:06,051
but then there's another issue I think 
is sending stuff through the post 

208
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:06,051
office.
It's like they're like,

209
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:06,690
listen bitch,

210
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:12,070
you fuck with us?
Will you make us a part of your deal of 

211
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,290
bringing illegal shit places and where 
the government you can bold.

212
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,480
Motherfucker know.
So they,

213
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:20,120
they went after those feeds.
This is the thing in California.

214
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,160
I know for a fact if,
let's say you have a friend that calls 

215
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,160
and says,
hey man,

216
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,320
you know,
we grew up together and everybody's out 

217
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,320
there and Kelly will pool and listening 
to Rihanna.

218
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,150
Send me a bag of weed and the cooking.
You do somebody a favor and get like a 

219
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,240
vhs box,
but we sent it to him.

220
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,540
He'll never get those mailman.
I've had friends that said boxes got 

221
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,640
ripped open like a dog had gotten there 
with the address on the bottom.

222
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,880
I swear to God and they've taken out of 
that.

223
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,210
Send it like,
what are you going to do that Hollywood 

224
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,931
post office on Wilcox.
Don't you go in there every Filipino's 

225
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,220
high as fuck that place.
Everybody.

226
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:03,380
Everybody's fucked up.
The trucks are crooked.

227
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,790
They say this is this guy.
Legit sent him a little bit of reefer 

228
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,610
and Eddie's book and he said the fucking
thing got there.

229
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,340
A month later,
a month later,

230
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:28,160
I bought like the three days a month 
later,

231
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,400
ripped open with Eddie's booking it and 
they took the weed.

232
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,890
Eddie's book got there.
You can't leave anything to government 

233
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:38,960
agencies,
man.

234
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,510
The Tsa.

235
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,270
Look,
I never complained about the TSA.

236
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,280
The Tsa in New York was the rudest 
person,

237
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,290
like the way she was communicating with 
people.

238
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,690
I ain't going to do all that.
You got.

239
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,320
You got to give that to this.
You got to move that over there.

240
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:52,720
I haven't used in Tuzla to lions.
He.

241
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,530
I'm doing talented.
JFK.

242
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,640
Yeah.
I was like,

243
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:57,050
this is incredible.
I was like,

244
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,220
I and I,
I go,

245
00:10:58,221 --> 00:10:59,570
you've been very hostile.
She goes,

246
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:00,020
no,
I'm not,

247
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:01,910
but I could get hostile.
And I was like,

248
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,000
wow.
I'm like,

249
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,020
people really communicate like that.
Just flippantly with people in public 

250
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,400
that are in positions like the Tsa,
like the way she was communicating with 

251
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,271
people but just like so short and so 
curt with people and so shitty just 

252
00:11:16,271 --> 00:11:21,071
right off the bat is if someone was 
doing something to her by having her do 

253
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,790
her job,
that's some offensive shit man.

254
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,280
When people get consumed with you,
just because their job sucks.

255
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,410
Like I get your job sucks,
but I'm friendly.

256
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:32,411
I'll be up.
We'll we could have a nice little smile 

257
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:32,411
at each other and,
and walk about,

258
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:33,100
you know,
go through this deal,

259
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,270
go through our time together.
It's not going to take care of the baby.

260
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:36,440
And the extra time.
Yeah,

261
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,220
she just got conti just right away and 
it's a thing,

262
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:45,221
man,
there's a thing with people in New York 

263
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:45,920
that I noticed this weekend and I dot I 
forgot about,

264
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,160
but there's that continence,
that curtness that people have 

265
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,101
sometimes,
but the real short with folks and folks 

266
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:54,101
are shortly with each other and I'm 
like,

267
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:54,101
wow,

268
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:55,690
that's interesting.
Because you know,

269
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:58,480
when that went away,
that went away after nine slash 11.

270
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,250
I remember always thinking that New York
was like,

271
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,100
there was like a certain hostility to 
New York that I didn't appreciate.

272
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,030
I thought it was an amazing,
amazing,

273
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:08,860
amazing city.
It's so fucking crazy.

274
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,300
It's beautiful.
Monolithic.

275
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,910
I mean it's like more beautiful than the
mountains.

276
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:17,911
Really.
It's created by men when that 

277
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:19,381
motherfucker is lit up at night,
it's more beautiful than even the 

278
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:20,170
mountains themselves.
So I'm looking at it and I'm like,

279
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:25,171
this is like really like one of the 
perfect creations by man as far as like 

280
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:29,520
one of the most amazing things that 
anyone's ever created and put on this 

281
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:29,520
earth.
New York City's one of them,

282
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,080
but you can't have that many people 
together.

283
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,210
They just get.
They get tired of each other.

284
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,010
They get,
they get shitty with each other.

285
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,480
USBS needs a warrant to open their mail,
but ups can just open to whatever the 

286
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:41,480
fuck they want.

287
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,920
Boom.
Supersede the government were 

288
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:45,920
contracting.

289
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,840
The La post office doesn't.
Motherfuckers don't need nothing.

290
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,350
They just need to whip it this nice to 
see you at the window and it moves the 

291
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:58,361
speed of light.
I guarantee you there's somebody at the 

292
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:58,361
glass going,
check that back.

293
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:58,430
Oh,
here we go.

294
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,370
Look at his friend.
Anyway,

295
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,700
avoid all this bullshit by using 
stamps.com.

296
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,520
Get a free scale scale.
If you.

297
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,850
There's a microphone in the upper right 
hand corner.

298
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:12,851
If you click on that microphone,
you enter in the code j r e and that 

299
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:13,420
code will take you

300
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,520
to the stamps.com
website where you get $110 offer and a 

301
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,540
free digital scale.
It's a very cool service and again,

302
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,010
like I said,
if you order one of those desks,

303
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,630
quad tee shirts,
that's a.

304
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:29,631
that's how they're coming to you bitch 
new shit taken to the next level.

305
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,630
Print new shed at home.

306
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,940
The interesting thing that the only 
people do it or in Kennedy airport,

307
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:37,670
and I'm not angry,
I'm not saying this is bad,

308
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,080
let like let's say me and joe fly out 
for years.

309
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:44,090
We flew out,
we made it 15 minutes before the flight.

310
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,100
That shit don't work.
Don't work no more.

311
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,560
So you and I have said,
fuck it,

312
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,230
we got to be that 11 will be there with 
that.

313
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,390
Open up a computer each.
You know,

314
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,310
I went there and did that Kennedy one 
day and they're like,

315
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:58,250
you can't go through security.
And I'm like,

316
00:13:58,251 --> 00:13:59,150
you can't be serious.
Like,

317
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:00,770
no,
you can't go to,

318
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:05,771
we tell you.
So they made me an army wait where they 

319
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:08,591
made me an army wait there and finally 
had the sleep apnea machine and I'm 

320
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:12,610
fucking hungry and if I get up at four 
and six and I haven't eaten my blood 

321
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,760
sugar goes,
fuck it up and I get dizzy.

322
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,460
I get that thing that,
uh,

323
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,580
Dana was complaining about whether 
there's ear years,

324
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,050
I get this feeling like I gotta Puke and
I went up to Atlanta to go listen to it.

325
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:22,880
I gotta go,
I got sleep.

326
00:14:22,881 --> 00:14:24,380
That's the only reason they let me 
through.

327
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,630
Why hasn't had the machine they would 
have held me there.

328
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:28,220
And I was like,
that's amazing.

329
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,110
I go,
well,

330
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,170
because they know,
you know,

331
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:35,171
I didn't eat.
I can't eat as soon as you fucking get 

332
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:37,991
up,
you got to drink some water and move 

333
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:37,991
around.
So what were they just hostile?

334
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:38,110
Very,
very.

335
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,070
That's why as soon as you said that,
I said Kennedy,

336
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,380
Ted Kennedy.
I didn't even know need to know.

337
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,520
Newark is not like that.
And look what is.

338
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,300
I have never had a problem in Newark.
And Laguardia Newark,

339
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:49,730
I had the problem the one time when I 
took the phone up,

340
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,010
the moon landing and the German

341
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:57,010
guy said to shut the phone off and he 
started yelling on the plane and then 

342
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:57,470
when I signed the cop goes,
I don't know,

343
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,390
you know,
you're only away fucking team here.

344
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:04,391
This is the home team day.
You tell him to turn the phone off that 

345
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:04,391
Newark.
No,

346
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:07,420
I never had a problem in Newark.
It was Kennedy and now you had it.

347
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,140
And I've had it twice.
Yeah,

348
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,200
I mean I'm pretty nice man.
I try to be as nice as I can to people 

349
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,770
when I run into them,
you know,

350
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,020
from talking face to face with someone,
I'm going to try to be as nice as I can,

351
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,760
but there's certain times where you get 
confronted with continence,

352
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,980
which shittiness that people have and 
you're just like,

353
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:26,070
whoa dude,
you know,

354
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,890
fucking relaxed.
I'm saying the blow,

355
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,160
especially in the morning,
I don't like this shit in the morning.

356
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,730
I tolerated in the afternoon,
in the morning,

357
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:32,420
I can't.
I'm like,

358
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:34,220
we could do this with a couple of 
servers.

359
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:39,221
And how you doing brother and everything
will be fine and we'll have a nice 

360
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:41,771
little conversation here,
but you're just doing your job and I'm 

361
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:41,771
just talking and we're just,
you know,

362
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:41,960
we're just two people running into each 
other.

363
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:43,610
There's not,
there's not conflict,

364
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:48,611
you know,
and like there's people there that have 

365
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:48,611
this hostile attitude.
They don't like making it a conflict.

366
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,350
I'm not here for a conflict of man.
I'm just saying hello to people.

367
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,150
Look at my bag.
There's nothing in it,

368
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,490
you know,
I'm just going to go to my destination,

369
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,870
take care.
Nice meeting you.

370
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,060
Good seeing.
And most of the time that's what I get.

371
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,360
Especially with the,
uh,

372
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,970
the,
the x ray people,

373
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,650
extra people or some of the coolest 
motherfucker shit.

374
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,790
I run into those people like the dudes 
that are working in security in those 

375
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,911
areas.
They're always asking me UFC questions 

376
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:15,241
and always being friendly.
I don't see them being shitty with 

377
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,501
people.
I see a lot of them actually going out 

378
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:17,501
there with.
It'd be nice to people.

379
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:19,010
So when I'm confronted with with someone
just being shitty right off the bat,

380
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:19,850
I'm like,
wow,

381
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,910
that wasn't necessary.
There was totally unnecessary.

382
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,920
I gotta be honest with you,
you and I and red band and this young 

383
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,580
man we're blessed with.
Or have you want to call it that?

384
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:30,490
We fly a lot.
Yeah.

385
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,520
I know that the recent conditions after 
nine slash 11 have stopped a lot of 

386
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,280
regular people.
They don't like it no more.

387
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,860
I gotta be honest with you.
A couple of weeks ago you had people on 

388
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,170
here and I know you tsa.
I have no problem with them.

389
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,070
I've had a problem with.
It's not easy either.

390
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,910
You go to them and your plane's going to
fucking blow up that fucking simple.

391
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,160
Okay.
And when you know that we've met people,

392
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,280
that situations have happened,
they've gotten through the line and 

393
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,280
realized they had a fucking bazooka on 
their luggage.

394
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,990
You know,
that always scares the shit out of me.

395
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,010
Bullets.
Yeah.

396
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:02,960
A friend of ours with the bullet,
you know,

397
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,080
that happens.
But I ain't never had a confrontation 

398
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,120
with them.
I've had confrontation.

399
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:09,620
You know,
people on the line.

400
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:12,690
Sometimes are the worst people you have 
real slow when you go.

401
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,200
That's my case.
Like I had a problem and fucking someone

402
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,120
vegas flying out one morning with some 
fucking guy that was 80 like,

403
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:22,040
fuck you.
Are you fucking serious?

404
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,860
Uh,
but no,

405
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,140
no,
no,

406
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:24,370
no.
I,

407
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:26,900
I've never had a problem with those two 
years at all at all.

408
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:29,900
It feels so weird.
Then I do everything as they told me,

409
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,920
the belt comes off your sweetheart,
you a fucking case.

410
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,220
I take the tube,
I leave my vapor pen and I confused them

411
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:39,280
with that.
I don't know what the fuck that is.

412
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,040
That's a lady I've never had a problem 
with.

413
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,570
But uh,
that,

414
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,070
that,
that particular,

415
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,580
you know,
you got to go to JFK.

416
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:50,040
You did,
you got it did sucks.

417
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,080
It's unfortunate.
I mean it was only a couple of people,

418
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:53,570
but it was just like,
it was more than one.

419
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,210
I was like,
wow,

420
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,460
this is nuts.
I'm just trying to be nice,

421
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,470
you know?
Would you have a move to New York?

422
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,630
I thought about it.
I always think about it.

423
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:01,390
Yeah,
it's,

424
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,480
it's kind of an interesting situation.
We'll talk about it after we get done 

425
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,480
with.
Oh fuck.

426
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,750
Fuck all the commercials,
man.

427
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,010
I don't want to do any more commercials.
All right.

428
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,350
Dot,
come to the last one.

429
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,220
O n n I t you don't know what it is.
Go Fuck yourself at this point.

430
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:17,340
Seriously.
Best commercial ever.

431
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,270
Uh,
what it is.

432
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,200
Shit that's good for your brain and odd 
weightlifting equipment.

433
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Uh,
one of the coolest things that we have 

434
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,481
now is the champ with the chimp 
Kettlebell that has the expression I 

435
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:31,890
like to describe the biting your Dick 
off face.

436
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,160
So if you see that that chimp Kettlebell
data is the look that chimp would have 

437
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,551
right as it's biting your Dick off.
And think about that while you work out 

438
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:45,340
with it and we'll give you some extra 
motivation and some extra strength after

439
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,650
a horrible car.
Fire.

440
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,690
Oh Dude,
that's so rude.

441
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,540
That's a chimp son.
Scariest fucking prime minister.

442
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:57,550
The planet.
And we're just lucky they haven't 

443
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:57,720
figured out how to use guns yet.
It's crazy.

444
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:02,070
Fox trying to keep these things alive.
Look at that meet and looking asshole.

445
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,910
Crazy smart ass hole that can kill you 
with his hands.

446
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,120
Yeah.
Why don't we have more of those?

447
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,710
It should be just running through the 
streets.

448
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,060
Oh my God.
What we do without them,

449
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,370
what we do.
Without them,

450
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,690
we'd eat the bananas.
That's what the fuck we do.

451
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:14,880
What's wrong with you?
Chimps?

452
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,360
Everywhere.
What's that?

453
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,380
You see that tiger up here yesterday.
The Mountain Lion Yang.

454
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:21,480
Glendale.
Fucking what do.

455
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:23,020
There's a lot of mountain lions lately.

456
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:31,390
We're always angel,
Lindale right by a New York Park when 

457
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:31,610
they call it.
I don't know what part of Glendale was,

458
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,510
but that's not an immediate to be seeing
that as the only way you get with her.

459
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,030
I'll fucking immediate release one of 
those fucking leopards was this mountain

460
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:41,250
line in the back of a white car driving 
down the street.

461
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,700
You know it give us.
They shot it on a porch.

462
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,670
Second shot it on someone's porch.
Oh my God.

463
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,550
Yeah.
Wow.

464
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,430
That's who need a mountain lion 
Kettlebell.

465
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:53,580
Just to give you.
Just say you're fucking working out like

466
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:56,420
that thing's going after the hardest 
domesticated.

467
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,870
Oh,
it's impossible.

468
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,320
You can't get them as a kitten.
Yeah.

469
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,380
He never can really domesticate them.
They never really domesticate wild 

470
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,671
animals.
You train them and there's a big 

471
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:08,100
difference is that dogs are dogs,
man.

472
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,840
They've.
They've been dark for so long.

473
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,810
Like you know,
like,

474
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,410
like my dogs.
They're super friendly dogs,

475
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:15,210
man.
I never worried about them being mean to

476
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:16,530
me.
I don't worry about weirdness.

477
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:19,440
I don't worry about them just flipping 
one day and ripping my throat out.

478
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,400
But with a lion or something like that,
that can happen.

479
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,260
Mountain lions don't.
You don't,

480
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,850
you don't own them.
Bitch.

481
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,030
That is straight den.
A killing,

482
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,680
straight killing millions and millions 
and millions of years.

483
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,930
Nothing but killing.
That's all.

484
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:41,931
It knows so much.
Diane Sawyer and I see a bear wrestling 

485
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:41,931
little line.
Is that real?

486
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:42,010
He could be,
yeah.

487
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,320
I mean people have done shit like that.
Like a monkey choking the bear,

488
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:47,190
like hitting him in the face with left 
jabs.

489
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,620
They can do that.
How come I can't train?

490
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:55,621
They train them.
They can see that one this week or with 

491
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,340
somebody.
It was a mountain fucking bad.

492
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,730
Big.
They say about something,

493
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,810
it was a leopard,
a fucking bear,

494
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,960
and then a third wild,
like something that was so obscure like 

495
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:06,960
a beef,
uh,

496
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,300
like they're all playing and chasing a 
ball together.

497
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,530
What we need,
we definitely need a mountain lion 

498
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,110
kettlebell.
That's for California.

499
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,240
They have a mountain lion problems in 
California.

500
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,170
I sold you.
I saw,

501
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:25,480
I went to Santa Barbara last week.
How big?

502
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,150
It was big,
I mean big enough to kill you for sure.

503
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:30,150
It was like coyote size,
my fucking pants.

504
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,160
It wasn't as big as the big ones.
You know,

505
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:38,161
they get up to like 200 pounds I guess,
but it was probably like 70 or 80 

506
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:38,161
pounds.
It looked like a coyote.

507
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:40,810
It was moving across the road and y'all 
coyote is like stiff,

508
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,370
but mountain lions like bounce.
They have like a bouncer and I just 

509
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,850
assumed it was a coyote because it seems
wild animal running across the road.

510
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,480
But then I see its tail and then put it 
together because you're looking at it,

511
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,490
you know,
it's a flash glimpse as it runs across 

512
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:57,910
your headlights.
But it was probably about,

513
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,300
you know,
70 pounds that,

514
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,300
that,
that'll kill you.

515
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,930
Dental fucking killed this shit Eddie.
I'm going to tell you was killing 

516
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:06,930
motherfuckers that snow in Colorado.

517
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:13,360
They take into deep April off.
That's why Jack Nicholson snap,

518
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,430
that's why in that movie that you could 
tolerate November,

519
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,350
December,
January.

520
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,840
That's cool too.
But now you're out of the weeds,

521
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,160
you know,
St Paddy's Day.

522
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:29,260
You're like fuck it.
Put away the boots march.

523
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:31,210
And they dumped.
Well how many inches have they gotten?

524
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:37,030
A big blizzard though.
Forty inches so often a month for the 

525
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,030
month.
In total.

526
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,250
I'm talking about they just locked the 
airport Wednesday,

527
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:39,880
didn't they?
Yeah,

528
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:43,050
they didn't come on.
Was tweeting about getting stuck there?

529
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,290
No,
they don't.

530
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,870
That's why you can,
that's a great place to live.

531
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,400
If you got a fly in April,
April,

532
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:56,401
you have a pool going,
the guys over putting chlorine in and 

533
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:58,640
all of a sudden I seen people with 
facebooking pictures.

534
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:01,510
The light lights with six or seven 
inches.

535
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,810
The whole town.
White April.

536
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,500
Two different kind of living.
Different kinds of living.

537
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:12,510
You,
you're dealing with nature on a 

538
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:12,670
completely different level than what is 
so pussified here in California,

539
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,970
but we've got mountain lions pitch,
we've got mountain lions and they're 

540
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:17,970
moving in.
There's been more of um,

541
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:17,980
I mean,
come on,

542
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:21,640
this is not,
this is not a one time situation.

543
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,790
They shot one in Santa Monica last year 
and then you've got this one in 

544
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,040
Glendale.
They're moving into urban neighborhoods.

545
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,240
They found one in my Monica last summer.
We have podcasts.

546
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,580
We discussed,
found one in a gore.

547
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,840
I'm recently out near Gora.
They have their,

548
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:37,470
they're seeing them all over the place 
now.

549
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,060
What is the reason why they're coming 
down into the cities?

550
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,190
Well,
there's two things going on.

551
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:44,070
I mean,
I don't want to be ignorant about this.

552
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,010
Stephen now will be on the podcast

553
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,010
on Monday,
the hunter from that media to show and 

554
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:51,020
he'll be able to explain to us a little 
bit better,

555
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,450
but I think there's been plenty of 
music,

556
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:54,140
man.
Let's fucking,

557
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,170
let's do this actual podcast is 
ridiculous on a.com

558
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,070
o n n I t use a codename on the podcast.
Here we are,

559
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,350
but we're not.
It's crazy.

560
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:04,970
I'm the audio,
the audio version,

561
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:10,090
so it's always the podcast.
Amazing experience.

562
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,370
I just realized that I'm asleep

563
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:23,130
doing a podcast with that stupid song.
What fucking difference does it match 

564
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:23,130
what I mean?
You know what I'm saying?

565
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,870
And now it's the podcast.
What am I doing?

566
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:30,871
What am I crazy?
But the podcast just began a fucking 

567
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:31,020
half an hour ago.
We don't need to play that Goddamn song.

568
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,090
Yeah.
The thing about mountain lions,

569
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:34,940
Joey,
Joey,

570
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,140
Joey Diaz is in the house.
Ladies and gentlemen,

571
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,050
for the people we need to stop editing 
this thing to just fucking accept it.

572
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,420
Serious can edit it.
Everybody else can go fuck themselves.

573
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,100
And that's really all that's happening,
right?

574
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:50,130
It's just a series.
It's editing the first part of the 

575
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:50,130
commercials out,
but during the commercials,

576
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,670
sometimes the best shit we say,
sorry.

577
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,270
So if you listen to this on serious,
he got to go,

578
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:54,930
uh,
go to itunes.

579
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,770
Maybe we should just mix the commercials
in our woods,

580
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,110
pull out like a cell phone.
I'm like,

581
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:01,680
Damn.
It makes it like fake.

582
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,360
Hey Brian,
what is that cell phone you have in your

583
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:06,610
hands and what?
Tell me about ting.

584
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,960
We should just do it once for fun.

585
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:10,610
What?
Uh,

586
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,680
the,
the issue with the mountain lions where 

587
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,231
they're seeing more of them.
There's one of them that cut a 

588
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:18,140
tranquilized yesterday in Glendale.
We're talking about this.

589
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,820
I saw one last week in Santa Barbara and
uh,

590
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,400
of course there was the big one in Santa
Monica that they killed,

591
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,360
which I think was about a year ago,
but they're not using dogs.

592
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:34,361
The hunt them anymore in California.
They changed the regulations and when 

593
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:37,961
you changed the regulations,
you're going to have more mountain 

594
00:25:37,961 --> 00:25:40,241
lions,
like it's still legal to hunt mountain 

595
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:40,241
lions because they're trying to keep the
population under control.

596
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,460
But by not allowing hunters,
these dogs hunter say that's the most 

597
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,530
effective way to kill mountain lions and
still incredibly difficult.

598
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,660
What kind of dogs?
They use hounds.

599
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,720
They use hunting dogs and they,
these specially trained dogs are 

600
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,531
designed to go find mountain lions.
They find mountain lions and they treat 

601
00:25:59,531 --> 00:26:02,811
them and then the hunter shoots him and 
that's almost the only way to catch 

602
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:02,811
these fucking things.

603
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,060
Okay.
Because they are in the woods.

604
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,120
Okay.
When you talk to me about an 

605
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,000
intelligence like nature intelligence,
their way fucking smarter than you,

606
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,100
they know what,
they're not going to get below you.

607
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:16,590
They're going to stay above you.
They know that it's harder to run uphill

608
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:18,920
and downhill.
The the like,

609
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:24,010
they have like instinctual things that 
you as a city person that's wandering 

610
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,461
through the woods,
you don't know what the fuck is going 

611
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:27,461
on.
You know you,

612
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,000
you literally need dogs to find them 
because they're too fast.

613
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:34,030
They're just going to.
They're going to hear you walk in and 

614
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,030
they're gonna be like,
bitch,

615
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,611
get the fuck out of their cats.
Their big giant cats that are living in 

616
00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:38,750
the woods.
Can we have this weird attachment,

617
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:44,010
you know,
to like certain aspects of what 

618
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,420
shouldn't,
shouldn't be legal when it comes 

619
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:46,420
managing

620
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,390
the wildlife around us.
But you got to be really fucking careful

621
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:53,391
about allowing predators to take hold.
I mean you gotta be really careful 

622
00:26:53,391 --> 00:26:57,740
because right now we're fine,
but if the balance can shift and you 

623
00:26:58,231 --> 00:27:03,231
start getting to know Australia 
crocodile situation where this place is 

624
00:27:03,231 --> 00:27:06,891
in Australia,
you can't fucking go because if you go 

625
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,531
you will get eaten by crocodiles.
Like they will come and they will 

626
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:10,860
fucking get you and there's too many of 
them and you know,

627
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:12,210
you just,
you just areas of the water,

628
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:13,860
you can't go there.
If you go there,

629
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,230
you're going to get God.
It's just gonna happen.

630
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,730
I don't find that acceptable.
I just don't find that acceptable.

631
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:23,280
I think the idea behind it is 
ridiculous.

632
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,060
Ninety percent of everything that's ever
existed as extinct 90 fucking present.

633
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,540
I don't think there'd be any problem.
We can't bear the crocodiles.

634
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,240
I mean it would be kind of cool to keep 
them around and look at,

635
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,450
but if it had to do with like crocodiles
overpopulating and starting to fucking 

636
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,420
kill people,
you can't.

637
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,930
You can't think about them as being like
one of us.

638
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,830
You can't think about them as being like
they are part of nature now.

639
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,080
That's a monster.
Godzilla mountain lions.

640
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,170
That's the wolf man,
might as well get,

641
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,350
I mean for mental health and gets you 
with the wolf man gets you.

642
00:27:53,351 --> 00:27:55,800
It's the same shit you just got got late
night,

643
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:00,640
night night bitch.
One of those big cats gets you to shit.

644
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,350
Fuck cheese.
That's a monster.

645
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,440
That's a God damn monster.
It's a mountain lion and we are working 

646
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,490
so hard to conserve and protect these 
killers,

647
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,830
these things that need to kill every 
day.

648
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,160
These monsters that run faster than us,
jump higher than us and only killed 

649
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,571
things with their face.
That's all they do and they can kill you

650
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,130
and even if you have a knife,
it could still probably kill you.

651
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,730
Even if you have two knives,
they'd probably kill you.

652
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,300
Even if you're trained.
They don't give a fuck.

653
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,730
Kill you.
That first lunch that they go that rips 

654
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,750
a limb,
that'll you fucking.

655
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,640
What do you call that vein?
That starts bleeding?

656
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,050
Cook,
rotted artery,

657
00:28:42,051 --> 00:28:45,920
and they hit it from every angle,
from every angle,

658
00:28:45,921 --> 00:28:48,350
the way they swabbed it.
You don't get something done.

659
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:51,230
You're done.
And I'll tell you what,

660
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,550
listen,
you know what?

661
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:55,790
The biggest animal I ever saw in boulder
was a snake.

662
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,490
Really right off hill road.
I never seen nothing like that.

663
00:28:58,491 --> 00:29:03,491
Well,
those yellow motherfuckers coiled like 

664
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:03,491
this thick.
What kind of snake was it?

665
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,890
I stopped and asked him.
You know,

666
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,020
I asked him where he was from.
I think it was like fucking died.

667
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:15,910
Someone's like pat that they let out,
I don't know and the most likes on my 

668
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:16,220
father in laws property and he was.
I was like,

669
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:21,221
what the fuck?
We had to pull over and apparently 

670
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:21,221
that's the thing they have a real issue 
with in Florida.

671
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:24,020
People just take pythons but like this 
thing do big fuck this.

672
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:27,810
They just throw it out.
Fucking white people.

673
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,810
Crazy white people in Florida,
man,

674
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,970
I got me a pass on it.
Won't see the rabbit.

675
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,150
Come on to feed my sheep,
feed my snake rabbit.

676
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:42,390
And then all of a sudden you realize 
you've got a rabbit eating monster 

677
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,480
living in your house and one day it 
wraps around your arm and won't let go.

678
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:43,970
And you're like,
alright,

679
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:49,030
I gotta get rid of this thing.
It's 18 feet long down to the fucking 

680
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,960
swamp and just go,
go be free.

681
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:52,210
My friend.
I didn't want to take it and kill it.

682
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,250
I mean I knew it was thinking about 
killing me,

683
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:59,251
but it's my pet.
I had a connection to it so I just let 

684
00:29:59,251 --> 00:29:59,251
it loose in the swamp.

685
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,440
I saw a homeless person walking down the
street with a snake around his neck,

686
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:05,610
like a big one too.
Was his pet homeless?

687
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:07,120
Got Snakes?
Scariest thing ever.

688
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,700
Yeah.
Rap or roles.

689
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,850
Weird man.
There's A.

690
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,950
There's a weird thing with reptiles 
because they don't give a fuck about 

691
00:30:15,951 --> 00:30:18,260
you.
They never give a fuck about you.

692
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,500
They're just conditioned to maybe do or 
not bite you to bite you or not,

693
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,790
but you.
Hm?

694
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,410
What should I do?
They have to think about it,

695
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,420
but they might just decide to fucking 
bite you.

696
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,060
But if you feed them and if you keep 
feeding them,

697
00:30:32,061 --> 00:30:33,650
you stay with them and you,
you,

698
00:30:33,651 --> 00:30:38,651
you,
you become this connection to food for 

699
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:38,651
them.
They'll accept you,

700
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:38,990
but if you die,
they're not going to cry.

701
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:43,430
They don't give a flying fuck about you,
and if they were hungry and they thought

702
00:30:43,431 --> 00:30:45,410
they could eat you,
of course they would eat you.

703
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,620
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter how long you've been 

704
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:50,620
feeding them.
You got a 20 foot long python,

705
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,180
your house bitch,
you're living in his house.

706
00:30:53,181 --> 00:30:58,181
Okay,
will you are you are his little slave 

707
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:59,120
and you are bringing him offerings.
That's King Kong.

708
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:04,270
That thing is tied to a fucking pole.
That's a monster and if as long as you 

709
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,190
keep feeding it,
maybe it'll let you come close me.

710
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,480
Maybe where you got it in your backyard.
What are you doing there?

711
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,580
You got to go cage back there.
You crazy.

712
00:31:10,581 --> 00:31:10,940
Fuck.

713
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,010
I can't deal with it.
So they can't even kill him,

714
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:16,960
man.
I can't go to Sally's house and see him.

715
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:19,440
Give like a white fucking mouse to 
think.

716
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,240
Especially when I'm high.
My fucking hands.

717
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,590
I've seen it.
I've seen people say come over.

718
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,090
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

719
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,360
I've seen.
I had a friend.

720
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:27,340
That's why I don't like it,
but man,

721
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:29,620
that's fucking creeped out for me.
I don't know.

722
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,220
It's completely creeped out.
I Dunno.

723
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,600
They're terrifying animals and those 
motherfuckers were the snakes walk 

724
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:36,820
outside with the snakes around that 
head.

725
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,030
It's those motherfuckers and bird on her
shoulder,

726
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,390
which makes me want to not understand 
like especially like a parakeet or 

727
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,411
something on you.
And I sit there and I get so high 

728
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:52,600
sometimes I get a fucking eagle just 
like I never see that.

729
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:57,601
I would love to see something like that,
like some jerk off doing magic tricks 

730
00:31:57,601 --> 00:32:00,820
with the fucking parakeet on this show.
One of those fucking birds are just come

731
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,690
swooping on fucking bird and the fucking
Iraq.

732
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,480
There's a great video of a hawk.
The comes into an eagle's nest to try to

733
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:16,411
get the Hawke's Bay.
The Eagles babies and the eagle just 

734
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:18,670
goes wham.
Grabs it and eats it in front and starts

735
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:21,910
feeding into the baby's wow.
Fucking crazy.

736
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,100
An Eagle just flies into this.
Hawk.

737
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,920
Hawk rather just flies into this eagle's
nest.

738
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,100
Wow.
It's crazy.

739
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:33,760
I know that there was a guy on it.
Watch this.

740
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,020
There's eagles just chilling,

741
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,600
covering it's babies and this hawk is 
like Gimme,

742
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,010
Gimme,
Gimme your babies and

743
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,220
the eagle just like bitch don't do to 
others.

744
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,230
America kills it on top of his babies.
Look at this.

745
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,080
Wow.
Are Her babies rather?

746
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,970
I'm sure that's a Mama,
right?

747
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,720
Only the mamas are the ones who guard 
the nes,

748
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:56,090
I believe.
I don't know though.

749
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,210
But look,
fucks up that Hawk and eats it.

750
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:05,230
Yeah.
They caught that on an eagle camera 

751
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,270
because they have a nest camera to 
monitor these birds.

752
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,750
But what a creepy world.
So the Eagle is the meanest one.

753
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,840
Other the baddest,
most Hollywood.

754
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,860
Did you ever see it?
No.

755
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:13,200
No,
no.

756
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,240
No.
What's in Hollywood?

757
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:15,710
My friend hawks.
Okay.

758
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:17,590
The Hawk,
he has um,

759
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,600
vista right next to all those streets.
What we used to curse on El Compadre,

760
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:28,140
he's him and his wife put cameras 
because they would wake up in the 

761
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,140
morning and see dead pigeons or 
something.

762
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,660
They couldn't figure out what it was.

763
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,490
And one day they got to have Keith.
Okay.

764
00:33:32,491 --> 00:33:33,220
Okay.
Yeah.

765
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,800
The picture of a fucking,
a pigeon landing.

766
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,610
And then this thing coming behind it.
Grabbing it and ripping his fucking head

767
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:45,611
off like a monster.
Just ripped his head off and started 

768
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:45,740
eating it without the fucking head right
there on Vista,

769
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:50,741
on sunset.
I went to the Museum of natural history 

770
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:50,741
and tremendous.
And the two of you,

771
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:50,741
you know,
you get to see.

772
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:55,581
It's amazing,
amazing the thing hanging the waylon 

773
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:55,581
top.
Oh,

774
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:56,150
it's still there.
The dinosaurs alone.

775
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,440
That means it's gigantic skeletons.
They have incredible place,

776
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,540
but they showed the,
uh,

777
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,590
the transition between the dinosaur and 
bird and you know,

778
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,850
that's,
that's a dinosaur.

779
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,740
Like it's.
They explained the whole thing,

780
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:13,130
like the dinosaurs that survived became 
birds.

781
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,820
When you see an eagle,
that crazy country monster that 

782
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,211
represents our country,
like what a perfect thing to represent 

783
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:22,211
our country.

784
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:23,240
Like we always thought.
I always thought the eagles proud.

785
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Eagles.
Both the Eagle is a county monster from 

786
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,721
the past.
That somehow or another I managed to 

787
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:31,721
stay alive and as long as you keep 
giving it birds,

788
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:35,850
it'll let you fucking hold it.
It's only.

789
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,620
The thing about eagles is they're not 
quite big enough to kill us.

790
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,840
They're not quite big enough.
You know,

791
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,900
I'm a kill and Eagle man.
I'll probably get fucked up a little 

792
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:46,900
bit.
I'll get scratched up a bit,

793
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,650
but if I get ahold of an eagle,
I'm going to kill that fucking thing.

794
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,600
Take the finger off,
right.

795
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,850
Probably fucked me up pretty bad.
I'll probably be cut up pretty hard,

796
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:55,730
but I'm going to win.
I'm going to kill that fucking eagle and

797
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,350
he knows it.
He knows it.

798
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,690
He looks at it and go,
damn,

799
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,730
I wish I could kill you,
but you just tell a little too big 

800
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:03,730
because then he goes only like 50 pounds
or something.

801
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:03,860
Right.
You know,

802
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:08,861
they looked.
I mean they're pretty fucking scary and 

803
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:08,861
they,
they,

804
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:08,861
like I said,
they will fucking hurt you,

805
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:10,580
but most likely they're not going to be 
able to take you out,

806
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,410
but they've tried to pick up kids and 
shit.

807
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,510
Eagles have picked up a little boys 
before.

808
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,180
I tried to fly off with him is a matter 
of fact.

809
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,720
There's a video of an eagle picking up a
kid that's a fake video.

810
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,330
Is it a fake video?
I've been just students.

811
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,440
Son's a pitcher.
He was not going to suddenly scared to 

812
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,230
check out.
Like I see a chicken dog and I panic 

813
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:29,960
like I'm scared of the chickens.
Chickens moving.

814
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:35,350
I fucking panic at all.
I could go into one of those butcher 

815
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:35,960
shops with animals,
those Italian,

816
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,160
like margiela and the east coast.

817
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,520
You ever go to those places where your 
mom goes in Newark and they have the 

818
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,810
fucking Italian butcher going in and 
have everything.

819
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,760
Like all those birds.
What's the whale?

820
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,760
Then they'll have like a chicken and the
other thing.

821
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:55,360
Then they get exotic.
You go do they serve as well?

822
00:35:55,390 --> 00:36:00,390
You Go,
you know people are into eating like 

823
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,630
shit,
like ego still,

824
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,020
but this is the place where you could 
stick your hand in and the guy would 

825
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,600
take the chicken out and break its neck,
cut it,

826
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:08,360
and then your mother brings him home for
Cte,

827
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,710
like pheasants,
maybe all that shit.

828
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:15,790
I mean,
in the old days they probably had like 

829
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:15,790
polar bears.
Don't give a fuck.

830
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,690
What are you gonna?
Need an alligator.

831
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,260
We got it.
Just give me 15 more.

832
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,490
Currently there's a company that will 
serve you like Ryan stakes.

833
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,210
Yeah,
there's like,

834
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,000
yeah,
they're like,

835
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:27,720
it's some sort of exotic game meat 
company and they'll,

836
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,780
they'll sell you lying.
You can eat lion and Colorado is known 

837
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,471
for that Shit.
Restaurants could blue next whether 

838
00:36:36,471 --> 00:36:36,471
you're taking 12.
We discussed this where they take you,

839
00:36:36,471 --> 00:36:39,480
they pick you meet up at the top of 
snowmass village and they take you there

840
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:43,320
and those things that the dogs,
they take you over a mountain,

841
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:45,460
you your wife,
they put blankets on you.

842
00:36:45,461 --> 00:36:47,430
It has to be in the winter.
This is real shit.

843
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:48,960
They pick you up at 5:30
sharp.

844
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:54,350
You get there,
you'd come out and you get all the 

845
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,851
alligator fucking a dinosaur dinosaur.
Fucking Puerto Rican meat.

846
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,580
Take a fucking rat.
It's amazing.

847
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:03,900
I saw it.
I never went there.

848
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:09,230
I knew the guy that had the dogs that 
would whip the fucking dogs and shit 

849
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,390
over there,
so we had like a sweater,

850
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,380
one of those,
but I know that if you fly into China,

851
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,320
Hong Kong,
don't quote me on which continent.

852
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,770
There's a restaurant that just 
specializes in testicles.

853
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,150
Jesus.
Did you see that shit?

854
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Every type of attack,
there's one that belongs to a fucking 

855
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,380
Allah.
It's a stamp and that's the big one that

856
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:30,630
comes with a soup.
It's like a testicle soup.

857
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,300
I think it's like $18 for the fucking 
suit.

858
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,710
Oh my God.
I'll look it up.

859
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:35,760
It's disgusting.
But,

860
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,370
um,
making sure people pay the Animal Dick.

861
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,370
That's fucking crazy.
That.

862
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,650
How funny is that?
Even real life.

863
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,860
Like your mom killed somebody in front 
of you,

864
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,950
like your ego comes in real life.
I was like,

865
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,410
eat your Broccoli.
I don't like Broccoli.

866
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,900
You Bam.
Bam.

867
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,410
What's that?

868
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,050
Oh my goodness.
Cat.

869
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,690
Oh my God.
They're all eating a cat.

870
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,960
Holy Shit.
Oh my God,

871
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,630
Dude.
That is a creepy,

872
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:08,760
creepy animal.
It's really.

873
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:11,370
It just pulled the meat away from its 
babies by the way.

874
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,350
One of them was like,
that is mine.

875
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,450
Well,
it's been,

876
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,640
it's been like taking it apart and 
feeding and I've been watching for 

877
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:19,640
awhile.
It's really cute watching.

878
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,000
Have you ever seen the video of the 
wolves are getting killed by the eagles?

879
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,150
Yeah,
guys have trained eagles.

880
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:31,660
You got to see this.
I think it's a mongols or is that a 

881
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,010
motorcycle gang?
They're uh,

882
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:36,100
they have a trained eagles,
golden eagles

883
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,400
that a swooped down and uh,
and kill wolves.

884
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,580
I guess Golden Eagles are even bigger 
than,

885
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,450
than a bald eagles.
I think I should look it up.

886
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,200
Let me look that up.
Oh,

887
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,640
Jesus Christ.
That's big because the size of that 

888
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,851
thing and look how it does this.
And the dude is all like done up and 

889
00:38:57,191 --> 00:39:01,240
like tribal traditional,
like animal skin clothes.

890
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,500
I mean,
he's in a harsh,

891
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:06,180
harsh world and he's got this eagle.
These got trained and this.

892
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,830
That's a bad motherfucker.
Watch this shit.

893
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,530
Yo.
It goes after a fucking wolf man.

894
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,290
I mean,
what a gangster bird.

895
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,540
That's mean.
You want to talk about that?

896
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:20,950
That's like the wolf is like almost the 
top of the food chain.

897
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,530
It probably thinks it is the top of the 
food chain.

898
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,080
I was like,
Oh shit.

899
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:31,110
Bird knows what a terrifying feeling 
that must be to be a Goddamn wolf and 

900
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:34,300
still be scared of this evil bird.

901
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:39,420
Look how it takes it out.
It just swoops down and grabs the bull 

902
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,150
by the back of the neck and just starts 
jacking it.

903
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:45,180
Don't you think though,
this wolf could easily just fucking 

904
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,380
attack this bird?
No,

905
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:50,820
you would think,
but I think the birds are stronger than 

906
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:50,820
you think they,
they're,

907
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,390
they're,
they're really primitive man.

908
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:57,570
I mean,
they're not like we look at them like 

909
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,611
they're all fluffy and shit,
but you look at their musculature and 

910
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:03,601
the way they're designed,
they're not designed like any other 

911
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,020
animal.
We sort of associate their size with the

912
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:07,660
way we would view like a mammal that was
that size.

913
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:07,990
Like,
oh,

914
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:10,210
that's not that big a deal.
Like if,

915
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:11,410
uh,
you know,

916
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,320
whatever.
A puppy or something in or a dog rather,

917
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:15,820
that was that big was trying to go 
after.

918
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:18,550
You think that a dog that's only 60 
pounds,

919
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:19,660
it's not going to be able to kill you.

920
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,780
That what kind of.
That's a Golden Eagle now that I've.

921
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,420
They killed that.
That thing would have claw.

922
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Yeah.
Could the claw and the neck and then 

923
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:30,480
they,
they tear him apart.

924
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,300
I mean their claws are unbelievably 
strong and there's essentially knives.

925
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,290
They have like knives on there,
they're huge arms do.

926
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:43,291
They can pick up a fucking salmon that's
swimming in a river.

927
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,480
Stop and think about that for a moment.
How strong you have to be to grab a 

928
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,050
salmon with your hands.
You're a big guy.

929
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:52,330
Joey.
Do you think you could grab a salmon?

930
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,070
Do you think you could hold onto a 
salmon?

931
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:59,190
There's no fucking way.
How about grab it and then fly off with 

932
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,480
it?
Do you know how fucking strong egos have

933
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:06,010
to be?
That's an evil ancient animal that we're

934
00:41:06,011 --> 00:41:08,140
like,
it's the noble proud.

935
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,120
Here you go.
Remember,

936
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:12,640
uh,
that guy that sang those songs,

937
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,120
the guy that John Ashcroft let the 
eagles soar.

938
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Did you ever hear that song?
Did you ever hear that song when 

939
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,771
Ashcroft was the,
what is the attorney general or 

940
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:26,320
something like that.
Whatever made up fucking title.

941
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:28,090
It was whatever.
Job Distinction.

942
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,890
Yet he was working for the Bush 
administration,

943
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,680
whatever function they in,
and he was completely crazy.

944
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:37,681
It was just nutty Christian guy and he 
had the most amazing song that he sang 

945
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:38,270
once.
And when he,

946
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,130
when he's saying,
and everybody knew right away,

947
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:40,760
like,
Whoa,

948
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:43,460
this guy is fucking nuts.
I mean,

949
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:48,461
we knew he was nuts,
but what the fuck is this worth the like

950
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,130
she's never saw before.
And he said,

951
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,660
yeah,
it's.

952
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,080
I mean it's,
it's,

953
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,470
you're watching madness,
you're watching 100 percent pure,

954
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:04,430
unfiltered madness.
And you just watching it.

955
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:09,610
All you think of is what kind of twisted
shit is this guy doing when he's not 

956
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,720
doing this?
Because if you're that far out there,

957
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,250
you're that far out there that you're 
seeing that the ego will,

958
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,070
you know,
and you're like,

959
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,240
it was like super,
super duper Christian.

960
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,960
Like that guy had some fucking bones in 
his yard,

961
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:23,330
man.
Or do you think Wolverine Versus Wolf?

962
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:26,550
Who would win if I had a guest pull up 
that left the eagles?

963
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:26,900
Soar.
Got,

964
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,120
I need to hear that.
But what's a wolverine?

965
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:32,290
Um,
I would say a wolverine is a,

966
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:34,520
it's like a Badger,
Badger,

967
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,110
Badger family.
And there were fierce,

968
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:39,140
unbelievably fierce animals.
They're crazy looking to.

969
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,820
They look bad ass,
man.

970
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,740
It's like hugh grant.
He does.

971
00:42:43,741 --> 00:42:48,741
It doesn't make sense.
They call him wolverine because the 

972
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:49,800
whole idea of wolverine is wolverine was
supposed to be built like Sean Sherk and

973
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:54,810
was like a small guy,
but he had these crazy muscles and he 

974
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,860
had like this adamantium skeleton.
You had like some metal skeleton,

975
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,980
but it was like a little like fierce 
thick guy,

976
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,960
but then you have the.
The guy plays him.

977
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:04,790
What's his name man?
The dude who plays,

978
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:05,920
what does it?

979
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,310
Hugh Jackman,
which I know.

980
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:10,790
I just said it isn't.
I like them to whatever.

981
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,970
I blamed the weed,
but Hugh Jackman is like this beautiful,

982
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:15,440
tall,
handsome,

983
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:20,490
you know,
like statuesque sort of male model 

984
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:20,490
looking dude.
It's not really.

985
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:24,840
It doesn't work for like that character.
The character is supposed to be like a 

986
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,750
wolverine and Wolverine's like and 
that's what this guy was like.

987
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:31,830
He was like,
this hairy dude with his hands would 

988
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:32,600
turn into these sorts.
Like they would come out,

989
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:37,601
these giant knives come out where his 
knuckles are and he would just fuck 

990
00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:40,361
people up.
It was one of the most ruthless 

991
00:43:40,361 --> 00:43:40,361
superheroes ever.
When you think about it,

992
00:43:40,361 --> 00:43:41,840
I mean because he would just kill people
all the time for the comic book.

993
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,630
Oh,
I fucking love the x man,

994
00:43:43,631 --> 00:43:43,990
man.

995
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:49,710
Listen to this day.
She's never before.

996
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,460
That's a real sign.
I don't know why it's got the cow bell 

997
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,770
and the cowboy.
The cowbell socks.

998
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,750
This like,
that was a cow bell thing going on

999
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,960
the Internet for awhile.
That's crazy person it a crazy person.

1000
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,560
Crazy person with black socks that 
stinky feet,

1001
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:21,020
sweaty feet all the time.
And leather shoes.

1002
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:25,280
Just wanting to get weird one that stick
his thumb up.

1003
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:27,730
Your Butt fucking choke you or something
bro.

1004
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,750
With Jay z going to Cuba.
I don't know man.

1005
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,010
I don't know.
I saw it in

1006
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,870
the news you see that you saw on the 
news was what was hilarious was that the

1007
00:44:35,871 --> 00:44:36,960
uh,
the people in the news,

1008
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:41,961
we're looking at it as a political 
liability for President Obama that Jay Z

1009
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:42,870
is,
you know,

1010
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,450
going to Cuba.
Then it weakens the,

1011
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:47,310
the Obama position.
Like he can't,

1012
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,840
he can't be friends with Jay z now to 
my.

1013
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,310
And I was watching it.
I was like,

1014
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:51,150
wow,
this is weird.

1015
00:44:51,151 --> 00:44:56,151
This is like they've managed to turn the
White House into the real housewives of 

1016
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:59,241
Orange County.
Literally have managed to turn the White

1017
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,760
House until like almost a,
a bit of a reality show.

1018
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:03,720
Like,
oh,

1019
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:08,721
what is,
what is Obama going to do about Jay z 

1020
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:08,721
Bnq?
But oh,

1021
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:09,180
that's crazy.
That's a really important thing to think

1022
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:14,181
about right now because it's not like 
there's a country called North Korea 

1023
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:16,820
that as weapons and it's threatening to 
shoot at us and has nuclear capability.

1024
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:17,580
Yeah,
man,

1025
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,590
what about that wrapper?
That guy who makes stuff?

1026
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:24,591
Ryan,
why did he go to that place where 

1027
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:25,110
everyone's poor?
What the fuck?

1028
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,960
I just seen the headline from Atlanta 
Vanna,

1029
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,400
something like that.
I'm like,

1030
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:30,420
oh,
this is terrible.

1031
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:33,600
It's so weird how right now in today's 
world,

1032
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,480
the White House is really what's going 
on around.

1033
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:39,540
It is a reality show compared to what's 
really going on.

1034
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,760
The wife is on Conan O'brien jumping up 
and down credible whatever,

1035
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,770
and I ain't got nothing but love for.
I love that woman,

1036
00:45:46,771 --> 00:45:49,200
but do you understand me?
I mean it's all different.

1037
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:54,460
Like it's like the government is pushing
that shit at you to worry about that.

1038
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,120
While we're really,
really going on right now,

1039
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:00,460
it's fucking scary whether it's Korea,
whether it's going on.

1040
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,530
Oh,
well one good thing.

1041
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:06,540
The post office ain't gonna fucking 
clothes now that you see that close on 

1042
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,951
Saturday,
starting in November for mail delivery 

1043
00:46:09,951 --> 00:46:09,951
on Saturday.

1044
00:46:09,951 --> 00:46:10,110
No more mail on Saturday.
November.

1045
00:46:10,111 --> 00:46:12,450
But no,
they just changed on the Monday.

1046
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:17,451
They found Jesus.
Somebody opened their mouth and so are 

1047
00:46:17,451 --> 00:46:19,800
you fucking serious?
I get my copy of my fucking time street.

1048
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:21,570
Whatever the fuck it is magazine.
I,

1049
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:26,571
you know,
I really wondered whether or not we 

1050
00:46:26,571 --> 00:46:26,571
would be better off with a privatization
and that,

1051
00:46:26,571 --> 00:46:28,020
you know,
because I think ups does an awesome job.

1052
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,550
I mean they're,
they're amazing.

1053
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:30,960
And the,
the postal service,

1054
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,360
the only issues that I've ever had with 
the postal service is going to the,

1055
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:39,240
the actual place to the actual place and
waiting in line.

1056
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,500
That's the only issue that I've ever 
had.

1057
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:45,830
But the idea that you should have a 
government company that does what 

1058
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:48,480
private companies do,
like why would you even need it?

1059
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,280
You know,
why would you need a,

1060
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,770
why do you need a post office?

1061
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:53,830
Why do you need,
you know,

1062
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:54,530
[inaudible] shit.
I mean,

1063
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:59,570
the post office as,
as it exists is great but shouldn't 

1064
00:46:59,570 --> 00:46:59,570
exist because,
uh,

1065
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:00,810
of the market because it's like,
you know,

1066
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,600
it fills a spot,
you know what I mean?

1067
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:08,601
Like why should it be,
why should it be the government that 

1068
00:47:08,601 --> 00:47:08,601
does that?
That's what it was.

1069
00:47:08,601 --> 00:47:09,250
One of the weird questions that are 
signing.

1070
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:14,251
In an ideal world,
it would be great if the government did 

1071
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:17,151
all that stuff right?
In an ideal world it'd be great if we 

1072
00:47:17,151 --> 00:47:17,151
could trust everybody to handle 
everything,

1073
00:47:17,151 --> 00:47:19,170
but it seems like everything gets 
handled best when it gets treated.

1074
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,970
Like it's a business,
you know?

1075
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:26,090
And when,
whenever you have like government 

1076
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:26,090
organizations that are taking places 
that could be taken place by business,

1077
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,320
you sort of like,
you're controlling things and regulating

1078
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:33,321
things.
I mean obviously in the post office it 

1079
00:47:33,321 --> 00:47:33,321
works great,
but it doesn't work great in the DMV,

1080
00:47:33,321 --> 00:47:35,560
right?
It doesn't work great in the TSA.

1081
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,330
It doesn't work.
There's a lot of places where it doesn't

1082
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:37,840
work great.

1083
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,340
Sure.
Jonathan winters died.

1084
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,410
Yeah,
I heard sex.

1085
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:47,460
Why is it,
you know,

1086
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:52,510
I,
I hate to bring this up and keep going 

1087
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,441
with this,
but why is it that like the post office 

1088
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:56,500
had all those shootings.
What,

1089
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:57,390
what happened there?

1090
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,860
Just because the workers were 
overworked.

1091
00:47:59,861 --> 00:48:04,861
I mean if you look at if you go to the 
post office back in the day because it 

1092
00:48:04,861 --> 00:48:05,720
doesn't happen anymore,
like the shootings don't have anymore.

1093
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,200
I,
I don't know why it's not happening 

1094
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,321
anymore,
but there was a time like if you go to 

1095
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:13,321
the post office now and you just look at
the people that are working there,

1096
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:15,520
that looks like the most miserable job 
ever.

1097
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:18,880
They're just sitting there nonstop from 
eight in the morning,

1098
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:24,460
but he just used stamps.com,
lightened the load and then there would 

1099
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,680
be less work and everybody could show 
the fuck out.

1100
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:29,070
Yeah.
You imagine that's a thankless job man.

1101
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:34,550
I didn't even check my mail and like I 
don't check my mail except maybe once a 

1102
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:35,100
month now and it's like the worst idea 
in the rub because I'll,

1103
00:48:35,101 --> 00:48:38,040
I'll check it and there's like all these
bills and like late payments and stuff,

1104
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:40,980
but I hate the mail so much that now it 
literally,

1105
00:48:40,981 --> 00:48:45,981
it's like a stack this big of mail once 
a month and only about five percent of 

1106
00:48:45,981 --> 00:48:48,990
it is something that I need you to pick 
up the mail it gets delivered to you now

1107
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,420
have a huge mailbox.
They just,

1108
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,140
they just,
I mean it's right in front of my house.

1109
00:48:52,141 --> 00:48:53,270
I just don't even care.
I just.

1110
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:58,290
Okay.
So the post office is completely a 

1111
00:48:58,290 --> 00:48:58,290
government Gig,
right?

1112
00:48:58,290 --> 00:48:58,290
I think it is.
Yeah.

1113
00:48:58,290 --> 00:48:59,250
My uh,
I have a friend back home.

1114
00:48:59,251 --> 00:49:01,710
My friend Adam,
who's a postman,

1115
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:06,740
he's been a postman forever.
He used to work out with them at the 

1116
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,770
Boston Athletic Club,
like back in the day and he's like,

1117
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:12,640
he was like a real neighborhood postman.
He would like go door to door,

1118
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,520
knew everybody.
Said Hi.

1119
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:17,340
They would like give them tips for like 
Christmas and stuff.

1120
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:20,310
It was like a real neighborhood postman.
Do they still have those?

1121
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,620
Yeah,
some places still have like a real.

1122
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,940
A guy who was like,
how you doing?

1123
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:25,610
Good morning.
Like knows everybody

1124
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,840
now is a dick.
But the guy,

1125
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,460
the guy hadn't Hollywood,
he was a Filipino and they gamble.

1126
00:49:32,461 --> 00:49:35,850
So I owned them.
He delivered to me first.

1127
00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:37,350
He knew if I.
I would tell them don't.

1128
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:42,360
I'm getting a check this week.
Stopped by here first and I'd see him 

1129
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:42,480
like at night he'd give me the check 
early and shit.

1130
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,930
Good guy.
Still seeing him.

1131
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,070
He's still down.
I wonder if

1132
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,530
so how those guys feel about things like
stamps.com.

1133
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,680
I mean they still have to deliver things
so you know what I mean?

1134
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,910
It's not affecting them.
That's actually probably make.

1135
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:54,650
Yeah.
It's probably like a lightening the load

1136
00:49:54,651 --> 00:49:56,780
a little bit.
Guys love their fucking job.

1137
00:49:56,781 --> 00:49:59,180
That's a great job.
You're walking,

1138
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:04,360
especially in California with the mail.
People hate more than fucking we do is 

1139
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,380
the ship they have to deliver.
That's why a lot of them.

1140
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:07,580
See I'm talking to you from the other 
end.

1141
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:11,690
I did time with three dudes that dumped 
the fucking circulars,

1142
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,410
so if a mailman dumped circulars,
they go,

1143
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,380
what are you talking about?
Oh,

1144
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,760
well you gotta think from routes.
It says grapefruit,

1145
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,100
three for ninety nine cents.
Spam spam in your mailbox.

1146
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:27,420
I know male guys that have done time,
like I knew a fucking hippie in the 

1147
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:31,640
coolest motherfucker ever.
Tenge coolest white dude.

1148
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:36,140
I loved them from fucking some white 
investment in Oklahoma.

1149
00:50:36,141 --> 00:50:38,750
I loved long hair.
He used to be fucked with them,

1150
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:41,660
put it in a ponytail.
This motherfucker filled this garage,

1151
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,980
I don't know,
for 10 years with the spam and something

1152
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:46,730
happened at his house.

1153
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:51,730
He had a fire in the backyard and they 
found 10 years on boarding the fucking 

1154
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,780
on it.
No,

1155
00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:57,110
he didn't want to mail it to people.
We thought it was fucking terrible,

1156
00:50:57,111 --> 00:51:01,070
but he had a do as part of his job.
They threw him in fucking jail.

1157
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:06,130
Oh,
they throw in jail because he didn't 

1158
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:06,130
send it out.
Yes.

1159
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:06,130
Those.
Because he didn't want to spam them.

1160
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:06,130
Yeah.
He didn't know.

1161
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:10,961
He liked the people in his neighborhood 
and these people got together and they 

1162
00:51:10,961 --> 00:51:11,930
got his little legal defenses down like 
two grants,

1163
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,950
two years in time.
He did federal time and then I met other

1164
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:19,010
guys a diagnostic who were cool mailman 
who just,

1165
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:22,060
that's the big beef and my one of the 
kids I grew up with them.

1166
00:51:22,061 --> 00:51:27,061
I'm very tight with filter this day got 
fired and he tells hysterical like he 

1167
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:30,280
used to take the little car into the 
city to go to the RTB.

1168
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,020
Right.
And he'd go pick up grandma,

1169
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,080
blowing a little mail cart and go back 
over the Jersey over the bridge and he 

1170
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,171
throw the mail away.
He would tell me how the whole place 

1171
00:51:41,171 --> 00:51:43,931
was.
He got fired before he got caught 

1172
00:51:43,931 --> 00:51:43,931
because all their phones.
And listen to this.

1173
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,620
This is 20 years ago,
so here you go.

1174
00:51:45,621 --> 00:51:48,590
You ready for this bomb?
They had him on tape 20 years ago.

1175
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,460
Gambling on the post office phone.
Oh Wow.

1176
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:54,950
They been listening on the phone before 
nine slash 11.

1177
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,470
The act of [inaudible] 66 that we all 
buy into.

1178
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:01,110
So they just recording agency since 
1950.

1179
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,650
They've been taping everything when you 
call home and tell your husband going to

1180
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:05,540
go home and suck his dick.
Got It on tape.

1181
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,870
You know what I'm saying?
It's hysterical.

1182
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:11,720
They called them in and play the tape.
That's hilarious.

1183
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,340
So this data,
we said,

1184
00:52:13,341 --> 00:52:18,341
well,
one of the day investigating the 

1185
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:18,341
bookmakers.
No,

1186
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:18,341
we weren't calling them and making my 
shift ends of the 12 come.

1187
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:20,180
No one's ever done a movie about 
wild-ass mailman

1188
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:26,980
because some crazy mailman stealing shit
and finding like some check and figure 

1189
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,620
shit they find they fucks.
Probably live checks to say.

1190
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:35,750
I mean like they walk around,
there's like these girls that are at 

1191
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:35,750
home by themselves,
you know these,

1192
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:40,160
these,
these wives that you know and they 

1193
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:40,420
probably know that the mailman,
right?

1194
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,210
Skanks you can make it happen.
Oh,

1195
00:52:42,211 --> 00:52:45,810
and do me a favor before you tough guys 
or the right ones for you.

1196
00:52:45,811 --> 00:52:47,340
Tough guys.
Touch your mailman.

1197
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:48,600
Touch him.
Touch him.

1198
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:50,490
Getting to be for your mail mail one 
time.

1199
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,990
Oh,
this is a federal employee.

1200
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:55,860
Yeah.
Tell your mailman one time.

1201
00:52:55,861 --> 00:52:56,700
Hey,
fuck off.

1202
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
If you're going to come over here,
don't fucking hit the gate because my 

1203
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,220
baby say that the middle man one time 
and see what happens to you,

1204
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:05,820
but how about don't say that because let
me tell you something.

1205
00:53:05,821 --> 00:53:08,730
Within 15 minutes you have a police car,
your house,

1206
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,680
and then you'll have another fucking 
employee,

1207
00:53:10,681 --> 00:53:13,360
some car that you've never seen before.
And they fucking.

1208
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,080
I had a friend that either mail man with
a Frisbee.

1209
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,700
Oh No.
And I was only,

1210
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:22,710
they were doing that shit and the guy 
cut across and hit them with a Frisbee 

1211
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:22,710
and they laughed.

1212
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:26,550
So the guy thought it was done.
Intentionally brought this guy,

1213
00:53:26,551 --> 00:53:30,960
did a year in fucking jail duty.
Fucking assault charge.

1214
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:34,050
Touching a fucking mailman.
But in both at one time.

1215
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,790
This is an interesting story.
In the boulder,

1216
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,150
there was a guy that got bit by a dog.
So now his phobia,

1217
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,030
he hated dogs,
but he needed the job as a mailman.

1218
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,480
So if you left your dog in the yard,
he would spray your dog shit to your 

1219
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,840
face.
So one woman was home one day,

1220
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,900
he heard the dog,
you know the dogs outside and seeing the

1221
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:56,950
mailman's fucking sprang and some she 
told the neighbors some other dog had 

1222
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:01,140
died in that route and the guy waited 
from this [inaudible] 90 no.

1223
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:04,240
80 six in boulder.
Guy Waited for the mailman.

1224
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,780
Next Day,
took him to the fucking boldly you to be

1225
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:07,440
careful,
bro.

1226
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:13,670
They took him in that fucking backyard.
Him and his brother and a beat on this 

1227
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:14,760
fucking guy.
I think one of them went to jail.

1228
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:16,980
The other boulders are fucking crazy 
place like that.

1229
00:54:16,981 --> 00:54:18,750
When you don't know who you're messing 
with.

1230
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:19,480
People.

1231
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,800
Colorado are the descendants of old 
cowboys.

1232
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:24,030
I mean you gotta think like back

1233
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:27,220
generations.
He imagined fucking mailman up.

1234
00:54:27,221 --> 00:54:29,120
I come in.
Well they did in goodfellas.

1235
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,960
Well,
if a guy killed your dog,

1236
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:32,340
you know that you love,
you might.

1237
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,960
You might be willing to do a little 
time.

1238
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,450
You know,
there's some pieces of shit out there,

1239
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:37,860
man.
There's some pieces of shit.

1240
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:41,270
It'll kill your dog.
Fucking poison.

1241
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,050
They don't care.
I have a friend who moved to a place,

1242
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:45,600
he had a Barky dog,
so I'm poisoned his dog,

1243
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,370
you know,
I mean,

1244
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:50,640
that's a crazy shit man.
You know,

1245
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:55,670
I mean,
I can understand that you ever have a 

1246
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:55,670
problem with it.
It sucks.

1247
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:55,800
It sucks it.
Some guy has a barky dog,

1248
00:54:55,801 --> 00:54:58,530
but poisoning the dog is crazy.
I mean,

1249
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:00,060
and not only that,
it was,

1250
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,330
it was a big area.
He lived in like a,

1251
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:07,790
a big rural area.
So his dog wasn't even on leash like 

1252
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:08,370
because his dog was allowed to roam 
free,

1253
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,760
but apparently people didn't like it 
that this new dog live in the 

1254
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:13,770
neighborhood and start barking.
So they just poisoned it,

1255
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:16,290
you know,
that's just.

1256
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,500
I hate when people,
uh,

1257
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:24,600
get defined in life has been like an 
animal lover or not.

1258
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:26,700
I mean everybody's an animal lover.
We're all,

1259
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:28,770
we're all lovers of animals that you can
trust,

1260
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:32,940
you know,
and when you meet a person and they have

1261
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,380
a cool dog,
like,

1262
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:39,750
you know,
a friendly person by their friendly 

1263
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:39,750
dogs,
you know.

1264
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:43,620
So like the idea that you could do that 
to spray dogs and the fence.

1265
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,890
Yeah,
that's like a sociopathic sort of thing.

1266
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:50,650
That little dog do you have.

1267
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,660
It's not even real.
It's not even real man.

1268
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:59,690
Is Your dogs.
Your dogs don't even really marked for 

1269
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,210
his first time last night for days.
And did you come?

1270
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,050
No,
no he didn't.

1271
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,030
He,
I have mirrors in my bedroom,

1272
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:07,410
like I'm on the doors and he just sits 
there and stares at Adam self because he

1273
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:08,370
doesn't understand.
Verus,

1274
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:13,580
and finally last night he went crazy on 
the mirrors and just barked his first 

1275
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:13,580
time it was.
Oh,

1276
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,520
that's hilarious.
He's so cute,

1277
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:15,450
man.
It's ridiculous.

1278
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:16,800
Yeah,
I found something.

1279
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:18,440
I've been cleaning out my office.
Uh,

1280
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:21,360
I found something the other day and it 
completely opened up like,

1281
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,190
like a memory that I completely forgot 
about

1282
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,530
when I was younger.
And this is so crazy.

1283
00:56:26,531 --> 00:56:31,531
I can't believe I forgot this.
We used to have this thing called time 

1284
00:56:31,531 --> 00:56:31,531
and temperature.
Do you guys remember?

1285
00:56:31,531 --> 00:56:33,820
Do you guys have where you live?
Where you called a phone number?

1286
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,550
Like the time?
Is the temperature?

1287
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:37,150
Remember that?

1288
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,610
Well,
the sense a call,

1289
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:41,250
your mother will almost fucking kill 
you.

1290
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,280
I didn't know that,
80 bucks and fucking time and I got a 

1291
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,800
fucking collapsed all over the house.
I remember that when I was a kid I had a

1292
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:54,801
calling card and if I didn't know the 
time I could use my calling card and a 

1293
00:56:54,801 --> 00:56:59,390
fucking phone booth and call and get the
time and temperature that wants to put 

1294
00:56:59,390 --> 00:56:59,390
his.
That

1295
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:03,360
the one in Ohio was free I think and it 
was just a phone number you call it.

1296
00:57:03,361 --> 00:57:08,361
But what happened is,
is at one point something broke where 

1297
00:57:08,361 --> 00:57:11,520
like anyone else that was calling could 
talk to the other people listening.

1298
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,030
So it became a chat room for like three 
months.

1299
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:16,950
You would call time and temperature and 
suddenly here like,

1300
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:17,820
hello,
are you there?

1301
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:18,810
Anyone there?
And you're like,

1302
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,620
yeah,
I'm here.

1303
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:21,540
How are you know,
like you start talking to people.

1304
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,720
So I met this girl on top on time and 
temperature and I got her phone number 

1305
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:33,440
and then we started talking for like two
weeks and she said she went to a 

1306
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,180
different school and all this stuff and 
then she was a virgin and she was like,

1307
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:39,660
I will pay you $100 if you sleep with 
me.

1308
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:40,890
And I was like,
yes,

1309
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:41,880
I will take that money.

1310
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,410
I was 17,
I was like $100.

1311
00:57:43,411 --> 00:57:45,180
That's amazing.
So she,

1312
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,790
I was kinda scared of how she looked and
everything like that.

1313
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:52,791
She came over to my.
I was when I lived with my mom and my 

1314
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:53,070
mom was out of town.
She came over one weekend,

1315
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:58,490
never met this girl,
just talk to her a few times on the 

1316
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:00,471
phone that are on time and temperature.
She comes over and she was like a lot 

1317
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:00,471
older,
like I'm 17.

1318
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:02,450
She was probably like 30 and I was like 
alright.

1319
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:07,530
And she.
But she acted like she was in high 

1320
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:07,530
school the whole time and I just was 
like,

1321
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:08,840
I guess she's in high school,
but like I knew,

1322
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:11,460
I knew that she was older,
like,

1323
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,880
and then she wrote me a check with her 
name on it and I was like,

1324
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,770
oh you have a checkbook or wow,
that's cool.

1325
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,150
Like I was 17,
I didn't have a,

1326
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,400
but she could write checks and I fucked 
her and I've now looking back at it.

1327
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:29,541
I never even thought about it.
She was totally an older chick that was 

1328
00:58:29,541 --> 00:58:30,390
fucking younger guys.
Like she,

1329
00:58:30,391 --> 00:58:33,960
I was underage and she paid me.
I was a hooker at 17.

1330
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:39,290
That was time and whether one of and 
pick up kids because kids can kids.

1331
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:45,470
Only kids were doing it.
Like I remember like this was like a 

1332
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:45,470
chat line for kids and I will be like,
oh,

1333
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:45,480
what's going on?
Yeah,

1334
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:48,900
Worthington.
So she was just some crazy freak bitch.

1335
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:50,320
It was fucking 17 year olds.
Yeah,

1336
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,630
meeting.
I'm on time and temperature.

1337
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,760
That's amazing.
But then she know you were 17.

1338
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:54,600
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1339
00:58:54,601 --> 00:58:59,601
I said I went to high school.
She said she went to this other high 

1340
00:58:59,601 --> 00:58:59,601
school that was like 20 minutes away.

1341
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:00,570
It's possible that she just did a lot of
meth.

1342
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,040
A.
Honestly,

1343
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:04,110
when she first came over I was like,
oh my God,

1344
00:59:04,111 --> 00:59:06,090
I'm in trouble.
This is the person's mom.

1345
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:09,310
But then she was the girl and then she 
like,

1346
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:12,120
we didn't barely talk.
I remember she walked in and we talk for

1347
00:59:12,121 --> 00:59:17,121
a second.
I just turned off the lights in my 

1348
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:17,121
living room.
We fucked on the floor and she gave me a

1349
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:18,790
check and she left.
It wasn't like in and out half hours,

1350
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:22,110
but you spend the money.
It took a while to cash a check because

1351
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:24,590
I didn't have a,
a checking account and so I had to like,

1352
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:28,050
I think I had to like get a cashier at a
grocery store or something.

1353
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,250
But yeah,
I spent the money.

1354
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,350
It's great.
I totally forgot about it though.

1355
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:37,960
Wouldn't it be an amazing reality show 
to follow that woman around?

1356
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:43,200
Like if you could go back in time and 
just watch how she did it in the age of 

1357
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,951
no Internet,
just fine young guys and meet them 

1358
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:47,470
somewhere and just fuck them and pay 
him.

1359
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:50,770
Actually Pam,
like how crazy was that chick?

1360
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:55,950
Do you think she was that crazy?
Or maybe it was just like a one time 

1361
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:59,101
thing where she just lost her mind and 
got caught up in the thrill of the 

1362
00:59:59,101 --> 00:59:59,101
moment.
Yeah.

1363
00:59:59,101 --> 00:59:59,101
I have no idea,
man.

1364
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,720
Think about how creepy that movies.
Because again,

1365
01:00:01,721 --> 01:00:06,721
how do we make one of the payphone at 
the bottom of the stairs at the comedy 

1366
01:00:06,721 --> 01:00:07,720
store and watch the checks coming in and
out of the bathroom.

1367
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:13,240
Will you guys do is way out of why the 
telephone when somebody's going to be 

1368
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,901
drunk and somebody should have never 
taken down that painful history.

1369
01:00:16,931 --> 01:00:19,300
Oh my God.
They should put a payphone back there.

1370
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:20,540
They should find a payphone.

1371
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:23,480
Yeah.
They took it down and they also took the

1372
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:25,670
wind down at the Improv that used to be 
outside of it.

1373
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:31,590
They shouldn't do that,
but you know it's still there at the 

1374
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:33,521
comedy store is where like all the guy 
comics come in and they tilt the the 

1375
01:00:33,521 --> 01:00:37,261
window so it's like perfectly.
So you can go to the stairs outside and 

1376
01:00:37,261 --> 01:00:39,020
just sit there and look down and see any
girls in the bathroom.

1377
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,370
Oh,
that's so gross.

1378
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,040
That's so gross.
That's so fun.

1379
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,180
That's why whenever I like my girls are 
like,

1380
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:52,270
that's really illegal.
You shouldn't even really be talking 

1381
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:52,270
about that on the phone or on the 
podcast.

1382
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:52,780
Allegedly.
I've never done it.

1383
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:59,180
Really creepy.
Sitting down by the phone waiting for 

1384
01:00:59,180 --> 01:00:59,180
fucking pictures to coat the.
If you're a girl.

1385
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,390
No Shit.
That's disgusting.

1386
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:03,170
Piece of shit.
That's a.

1387
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:08,190
that's a terrible human being.
And you're like thinking it's all silly 

1388
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:08,190
there.
Run your foot.

1389
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:08,980
Jamie Kilstein would be yelling at you 
right now.

1390
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:12,200
Crying out rape culture.
Say that.

1391
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,820
I've noticed they do that.
Yeah,

1392
01:01:15,821 --> 01:01:18,820
and I could probably tell you someone 
should fucking black that out,

1393
01:01:18,821 --> 01:01:19,720
man.
You just call them.

1394
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:22,780
Call the manager and they have to do.
Now they're going to have to.

1395
01:01:22,781 --> 01:01:23,920
By the way,
you just fucked it up.

1396
01:01:23,921 --> 01:01:27,480
We've all done things,
but that's one of the fucking life.

1397
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:32,900
You're not gonna be able to pull that 
off anymore because you talked about on 

1398
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,371
the podcast and the comedy store's going
to have to fix that or they'll be 

1399
01:01:35,371 --> 01:01:37,921
liable.
It's funny because every time you have 

1400
01:01:37,921 --> 01:01:37,921
to let them know,
man,

1401
01:01:37,921 --> 01:01:40,531
if you let go in there,
you better let them know for real 

1402
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:40,531
because people are going to talk about 
it in the pocket.

1403
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:40,570
That's a big issue,
man.

1404
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,010
You're.
You're making it out like it's not a big

1405
01:01:42,011 --> 01:01:45,100
issue,
but looking in on girls like fixing of a

1406
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,890
mirror or a window to look into girls 
while they shit.

1407
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,000
That's like a seriously against the law 
and seriously creepy.

1408
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:53,180
Yeah,
I agree,

1409
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:58,530
but you're just joking around about it.
I'm saying that every time I have a 

1410
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:01,691
girl,
I'm with a girl and she goes to the 

1411
01:02:01,691 --> 01:02:01,691
bathroom.
That's the one thing I say,

1412
01:02:01,691 --> 01:02:02,390
make sure those things are shut when you
go in there.

1413
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:04,280
Blind things stuff.
Well,

1414
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,310
I mean if you go in there as a girl 
though and you see it,

1415
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:08,420
it's obvious like,
all right,

1416
01:02:08,421 --> 01:02:10,370
there's an open window right here.
I should shut this.

1417
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,200
That shit's ridiculous.
It shouldn't be there.

1418
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,290
It shouldn't be like that.
Girls shouldn't have to be,

1419
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,570
especially in a place where they're 
serving alcohol.

1420
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,680
The last thing that should have to 
happen as a girl should have to worry 

1421
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:21,680
about who could

1422
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,500
possibly looking through a window while 
she shitting.

1423
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:22,740
Yeah,

1424
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,620
that's nonsense.
That's complete nonsense.

1425
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:26,440
Fix that.

1426
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:31,030
You just eat edibles.
Careful.

1427
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:34,120
You're a dangerous man.
Champions going to be jamming.

1428
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:39,570
These edibles are potent shit.
Sterile cap at the whole bag it 130 that

1429
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:41,220
this fucking thing.
Okay.

1430
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,050
Uh,
it's like a tootsie roll.

1431
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,390
Fucking kill you.
It's amazing.

1432
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,770
By next year in California that's going 
to be like zombies.

1433
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,100
They will be zombies because they're 
going to double this.

1434
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,630
This is for fucking loads.
They're going to double this.

1435
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,670
Don't,
don't say it.

1436
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:04,710
Don't say that.
People are going to be walking around 

1437
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:04,710
with shirts ripped open

1438
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:08,790
zombies and shit and that is fucking 
crib.

1439
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:10,890
You know,
we've all had the,

1440
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:11,820
I don't know,
I don't know.

1441
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,760
I don't remember looking through the 
peephole over that.

1442
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,100
You don't know,
just,

1443
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:21,170
it was just fucking crazy shit that you 
try to think of all the crazy women that

1444
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:25,440
I met through that over the years and 
the different situations.

1445
01:03:25,441 --> 01:03:30,441
It's fucking crazy.
You could write a book and it's kind of 

1446
01:03:30,441 --> 01:03:30,441
disgusting.
Oh,

1447
01:03:30,441 --> 01:03:31,400
the comedy story saying disgusting.
You know what the,

1448
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:36,550
the beautiful thing about the comedy 
store was the comradery between 

1449
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:40,371
contracts,
like we all sit in that back and hang 

1450
01:03:40,371 --> 01:03:40,371
out.
That was a,

1451
01:03:40,371 --> 01:03:41,310
there was so much camaraderie and that 
guess still is.

1452
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:46,380
Yeah.
It's like having an employee meeting 

1453
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:46,380
with,
uh,

1454
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:46,380
your,
your peers every night.

1455
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:46,380
And it's,
it was,

1456
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,320
uh,
it was so loosely regulated.

1457
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:49,810
You know,
it's getting more tighter now,

1458
01:03:49,811 --> 01:03:51,080
unfortunately.
Well,

1459
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:56,170
we kind of have to do that.
It should have probably been tighter a 

1460
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:56,740
long time ago,
but the real issue was always,

1461
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,040
you know,
how do you,

1462
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:02,680
how do you run a club and run a business
and then still sort of let the comedians

1463
01:04:02,681 --> 01:04:05,260
do whatever the fuck they want.
Sometimes it doesn't work out.

1464
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,690
Comedians wreck your blades,
you know,

1465
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:11,160
that's why I always try to contribute to
that place as much as I could.

1466
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:15,430
Like is like I would do it for free.
I paid for the sound system there.

1467
01:04:15,431 --> 01:04:15,830
It's like,
what?

1468
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,550
You need to go back there and pay for 
any sentences.

1469
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:19,690
No,
that's bullshit.

1470
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:23,560
I'm sure it has a sound system.
I bought in like 2001 or some shit,

1471
01:04:23,561 --> 01:04:24,730
you know,
it's an old sound.

1472
01:04:24,731 --> 01:04:28,720
So it's scary there too because I do the
show up in the belly room and,

1473
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:33,750
and uh,
up in the belly room is like falling 

1474
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,731
apart like you,
like I went to plug something in and 

1475
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:35,731
like all the electricity went out and 
then I'm like,

1476
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:37,870
these,
these outlets are not legal.

1477
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:40,480
Like this is impossible.
Like you would like,

1478
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:41,520
I'll turn on,
light

1479
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,370
them under the bus boy,
keep it up,

1480
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:44,750
keep it up.
You're like,

1481
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:49,751
fuck you.
There's gonna be people that are 

1482
01:04:49,751 --> 01:04:50,330
thinking big conspiracy.
Well,

1483
01:04:50,331 --> 01:04:53,510
what I know is the Joe Rogan had a 
problem with us.

1484
01:04:53,511 --> 01:04:55,430
Next thing,
his little bitch,

1485
01:04:55,431 --> 01:05:00,431
Brian Rad.
He's just talking about the lines about 

1486
01:05:01,701 --> 01:05:05,030
our security staff with some of the 
finest in Los Angeles.

1487
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:07,520
Okay.
I handpick them myself.

1488
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,400
Fucking thing blew up.
But things from 1920 people.

1489
01:05:13,401 --> 01:05:17,430
She's dead.
Oh fuck.

1490
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:19,470
See,
I have nothing but love.

1491
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,260
Got One foot in the grave.
One of banana peel that she's very.

1492
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,910
She's very unhealthy.
But I love that.

1493
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,120
Have never had any,
any issue with her.

1494
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:31,650
But I'm talking about the building that 
it's funny watching it.

1495
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:37,020
Nope.
There's no maintenance man walking 

1496
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:37,020
around in the daytime looking at the 
fucking uh,

1497
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,740
the plugs attention.
I don't know about.

1498
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,760
She didn't want to lift a rock for 18 
years ago.

1499
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,280
That motherfucker must be leaking like a
motherfucker.

1500
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:48,820
That thing that it's didn't want to go.
Remember she got Bob Baker up.

1501
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:53,821
They're putting this back on.
That motherfucker made a coke and 

1502
01:05:53,821 --> 01:05:54,100
fucking black tar and all that shit.

1503
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,450
Fucking roof of your building.
You a fucking problem.

1504
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:02,170
Fuck no fucking jumped off a roof.
Fucking.

1505
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:04,750
It's fucking California.
It's 80 degrees outside.

1506
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:07,920
Fuck Bob Baker.
Fucking Bob Baker putting.

1507
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:08,680
Fuck.
Come on up.

1508
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:09,760
Help me.
You fucking crazy.

1509
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:10,690
I'm gonna.
Fall under that roof.

1510
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:15,900
I got nobody that suit.
Do you remember when the guys were 

1511
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,890
launching water balloons from talking 
about that the other day?

1512
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:19,030
Yeah,
whatever was there.

1513
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,860
There was like.
That was about seven years ago.

1514
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,280
Steve Reynolds.
Easy.

1515
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:24,070
Hey,
it was.

1516
01:06:24,071 --> 01:06:27,490
Who the fuck are you talking about?
Jesus Christ.

1517
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:30,490
Son T,
you need to go to a doctor.

1518
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:35,520
I swear to God.
Five years before someone who's shy 

1519
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,360
right now.
We can't tell the story.

1520
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,390
I heard the story five years before I 
got there.

1521
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,980
When Tupac shot the gun in there.
Oh,

1522
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,550
it was all a black club.
They used to have metal detectors at the

1523
01:06:45,551 --> 01:06:47,890
door in 95.
I never saw that.

1524
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,570
I was there.
I was there in [inaudible] 94.

1525
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:52,360
It wasn't like that.
They would just have like fat Tuesday's.

1526
01:06:52,361 --> 01:06:57,361
We get crazy.
The one that Eddie Griffin was saying 

1527
01:06:57,361 --> 01:06:57,361
one night,
Tupac Lynn,

1528
01:06:57,361 --> 01:06:57,361
and then they had to shoot out and 
everybody ran.

1529
01:06:57,361 --> 01:06:59,260
Mitzi bandom because she thought it was 
him.

1530
01:06:59,261 --> 01:07:01,650
In fact,
the bullets are still on the front room.

1531
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:06,040
I'm one of the things still yet to fuck.
I wouldn't.

1532
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:11,100
I wouldn't doubt that.
There is some crazy shit that went down 

1533
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,591
there because they,
they did have some crazy shit happen 

1534
01:07:13,591 --> 01:07:16,051
there.
Even like Kennison shot a gun in that 

1535
01:07:16,051 --> 01:07:16,051
place.
He,

1536
01:07:16,051 --> 01:07:16,330
there's a hole in the backside and that 
came from kinisons gun.

1537
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,400
It's still there.
The whole still there.

1538
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:20,800
It's kind of fucking cool.
You know,

1539
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,060
just to be around a place for Camp Sam 
Kinison last shot.

1540
01:07:24,061 --> 01:07:26,710
A hole in a fucking sign.
I think it was about dice tip.

1541
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,390
Was it?
Yeah.

1542
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:30,550
I think we should have asked him about 
how he did.

1543
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:32,140
My memory is done.
You know,

1544
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,050
it's crazy.
My memories.

1545
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:39,060
It's filled no room.
I'm taking it too much information 

1546
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:39,060
lately.
It's crazy.

1547
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:39,860
At 30 years from now,
you know,

1548
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:45,210
and they know they're going to call and 
say somebody you often 10 million for 

1549
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:45,630
that property.
Oh the store.

1550
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:51,150
Anything.
Any day somebody is going to break and 

1551
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:51,150
go,
you know what the fuck,

1552
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,020
let's buy that side.
This side.

1553
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:55,280
The side across the street.
Well you know,

1554
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:58,180
it's worth a lot of money.
Worth a lot of history of that place.

1555
01:07:58,181 --> 01:08:00,040
It's just under history is on the fire.
But.

1556
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:02,800
But some John Deere fireball,
some Japanese group,

1557
01:08:02,801 --> 01:08:05,400
we don't give a fuck about her.
It's true.

1558
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:08,790
It's going to show up with 60 mil,
but an underground casino in there.

1559
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,070
Whatever the fuck they do because all 
those streets haunted and you know what?

1560
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,730
We're going to be driving by that he is 
going to come because it's.

1561
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:19,770
It's.
It's impossible to pull something like 

1562
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:22,251
that off today.
Is someone willing to gamble that much 

1563
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:22,251
money today?
Or is this a tricky economy?

1564
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:24,540
I don't know.
Every time you go to vegas,

1565
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,670
every time you go to vegas,
aren't they building a new fact?

1566
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:31,060
Somebody is talking to somebody telling 
them that the future is bright.

1567
01:08:31,061 --> 01:08:32,760
You gotta be bright.
You know what it also is to.

1568
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:35,130
They just adjust.
Like instead of making 10 billion,

1569
01:08:35,131 --> 01:08:36,240
okay,
we're making five.

1570
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,620
We call,
we call with five,

1571
01:08:37,621 --> 01:08:40,420
let's be cool with 5 billion and they 
just cut it in half and they're.

1572
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:45,580
They take a loss.
All those guys have something that's 

1573
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,970
losing though that fucking angle to 
write off and have a good time.

1574
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,000
But to take that place down,
it would be so sad.

1575
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:54,930
Every place has gone down.
Even fucking Arnold's went down on happy

1576
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:55,770
days.
You know what I'm saying?

1577
01:08:55,771 --> 01:08:58,850
It was arnold's fucking real.

1578
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:06,000
It was real enough.
But they shoot,

1579
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:09,410
they fucking take everything the fuck 
down and that's,

1580
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,010
you know,
that's the reality of it.

1581
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:16,030
It's so weird.
I don't even go to that side of the 

1582
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:17,811
sunset.
I know how I drive by it and I feel 

1583
01:09:17,811 --> 01:09:20,241
guilty.
When I had my ear infection I had to go 

1584
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:21,740
to Canada to go get a hearing test and I
drove past and there was amazing.

1585
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:26,800
I'm like,
when was the last time I drove on 

1586
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,300
bucking sunset when you and I used to 
hang out there between like was it like,

1587
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,850
I think like 98,
97,

1588
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,610
97,
2005.

1589
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,090
I was in

1590
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:37,390
Kinda wish you guys would hang out with 
us one day to me,

1591
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:39,340
Don Barris and all of us,
Tony Inches,

1592
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,620
all just sitting in the back shooting 
the shit,

1593
01:09:41,621 --> 01:09:42,640
smoking too much weed

1594
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:48,010
back.
Seeing the same people who were in 

1595
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:49,010
charge back then during the men steal 
stele incident.

1596
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:49,880
They're still in charge.

1597
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,890
They're the only person there is one 
person,

1598
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:54,470
people,
man,

1599
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:57,760
that angle of it is forgotten.
I take it from a different angle.

1600
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,200
That was then.
This is.

1601
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:00,730
No,
there's nothing I could do to bring that

1602
01:10:00,731 --> 01:10:01,480
back.
Why don't I?

1603
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:04,330
Why don't I go home,
get my football jacket and put it on.

1604
01:10:04,331 --> 01:10:09,331
It ain't got in front of my high school.
The improv has never been anything but 

1605
01:10:09,341 --> 01:10:13,310
cool to me know they're very proud of 
them.

1606
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,280
All of them were great and on top of 
that,

1607
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:22,660
I mean there's also the laugh factory.
Jamie Masada is a wacky dude.

1608
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:26,890
Nice final month and then there's the 
fucking ice house,

1609
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:30,220
which is the greatest club in the world.
That's my back yard.

1610
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:34,310
I don't even need to go anywhere else.
I'm fucking hobbyist out.

1611
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:34,650
The thing

1612
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:36,220
cool though,
is that all of you,

1613
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:39,780
like if you guys were to come last night
on the patio as an example,

1614
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:41,850
you guys would have been like,
oh my God,

1615
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:44,940
there's like 30 people here that I know 
all in one big group.

1616
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:45,780
What?
I mean,

1617
01:10:45,781 --> 01:10:49,930
everyone's got their dogs now and it's 
amazing place.

1618
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:51,780
I'm going to hit you from a different 
angle.

1619
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:53,230
This is the angle I like that.

1620
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:59,760
I remember being up there and being 30,
seeing old guys going,

1621
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:04,770
what the fuck I gotta hear this story 
when he was here.

1622
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,880
He,
you know,

1623
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,420
I'm so insecure when it comes to that.
Joe.

1624
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,580
I saw Carlin there.
Dude Carlin hung out.

1625
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,980
That was one night.
I know.

1626
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,530
What I'm saying is,
you know those guys that become that.

1627
01:11:16,531 --> 01:11:18,170
All of a sudden I don't want to be 
there,

1628
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,460
but you know,
this guy's like dom irrera.

1629
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:22,390
He'll stop in.
He just bangs out.

1630
01:11:22,391 --> 01:11:23,970
Is set.
Hangs out a little bit.

1631
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:27,840
Dama Breira is one of the coolest 
motherfuckers that guy is.

1632
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,660
He's like a real stand up.
You know,

1633
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:33,220
like when you got the weekend with him 
and did you say this?

1634
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:36,240
You guys are working together one 
weekend together at the Ice House.

1635
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:40,130
The last week.
It's for shows crush.

1636
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,300
You don't like the building on fire once
in the.

1637
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:45,510
It's going to implode.
Let me tell you something.

1638
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:49,200
Dom irrera is one of the most underrated
headliners ever.

1639
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,790
That's my take on him.
I.

1640
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:55,850
That guy is when he's on when dominant,
like I did that show with him at the 

1641
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,070
factory and he was on.
Dude,

1642
01:11:57,190 --> 01:12:00,630
he's fucking brilliant.
Hilarious.

1643
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:03,870
The shit that he comes up with the and 
he constantly rights.

1644
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:08,930
He's constantly writing.
He's constantly like looking at the 

1645
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:08,930
news,
coming up with new shit.

1646
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:10,160
I've heard two beautiful jokes the last 
six months.

1647
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:15,450
That a brilliant.
The one joke was the one my boy said on 

1648
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:18,761
the Oscars when he said that.
Right now the show's being viewed by 2 

1649
01:12:18,761 --> 01:12:22,630
billion people.
That's why God is going to come up here 

1650
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:22,630
and ask you about her privacy.
Something like that.

1651
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:26,780
That's a well written Joe Damo rabbit 
athletic joke.

1652
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,960
That's a great job.
That is one of the best jokes I haven't 

1653
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,680
heard in a long time since your island,
Nicole.

1654
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:39,610
That is one.
Save the fucking that athletic athletic 

1655
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:41,620
neighborhood.
It is such a fuck.

1656
01:12:41,621 --> 01:12:43,710
And you know,
say the joke.

1657
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:45,290
I don't want to.
I don't want to say it.

1658
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,780
You got to see it.
What do you get a chance to see this?

1659
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:52,781
Because you guys are what?
Where is this that you guys are gonna 

1660
01:12:52,781 --> 01:12:53,740
work together the last week of July,
like the four shows.

1661
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:58,770
Oh my God,
we've got putting shows Friday to 

1662
01:12:58,770 --> 01:12:59,060
Saturday and I'm honored because you 
know what?

1663
01:12:59,061 --> 01:13:04,061
After I've been watching them that that 
Wednesday night he's got at the laugh 

1664
01:13:04,061 --> 01:13:04,061
factory is when you really get the seat 
down.

1665
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:06,940
That's it.
He's in the catcher seat.

1666
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:08,480
His legs,
I think it's Tuesday,

1667
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:09,770
right?
What's in it?

1668
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:12,110
Busting balls with Donald Wednesday too.
He does.

1669
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:17,230
He does more than one show there.
It's going to take a look no matter who 

1670
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:20,901
he got there sometimes,
and I don't like to say that sometimes 

1671
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:21,410
he's got and you'll understand what I'm 
saying,

1672
01:13:21,411 --> 01:13:24,590
Joe.
Sometimes he's got a comic on there that

1673
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:29,620
doesn't shine and the social avenue of 
comedy sometimes some people just so 

1674
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:31,970
introverted.
Go Watch them with those people.

1675
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:37,360
He brings it to life and he's brilliant.
He turns around and Bob so friendly.

1676
01:13:38,031 --> 01:13:41,450
It's easy to easy to banter back and 
forth.

1677
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,040
When they called me and asked me,
I said,

1678
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:44,030
yeah,
why not?

1679
01:13:44,031 --> 01:13:46,950
I just watched.
Now I want somebody for four shows and I

1680
01:13:46,951 --> 01:13:51,951
got a different flavor.
It's very tough to learn from somebody 

1681
01:13:51,951 --> 01:13:55,180
when you watch 10 minutes sets in La,
La me doesn't give people come out and 

1682
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,900
I'm not discouraging people coming out 
and going,

1683
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:58,310
oh,
I'm going to Joe Rogan.

1684
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,740
Excuse me,
at the comedy store.

1685
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,490
That's a 20 minute set.
At least sometime sit tight.

1686
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,700
We'll get there.
But to see a 10 minute dominant wherever

1687
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:11,440
tartar,
45 minute damn Rara yeah.

1688
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,800
It's two different fucking people.

1689
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:13,440
Yeah.
It's,

1690
01:14:13,441 --> 01:14:15,170
I think it's that way with you as well.
Uh,

1691
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,740
you know,
I think it's that way with anybody.

1692
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:18,480
You know,
I've seen you do 10 minutes.

1693
01:14:18,481 --> 01:14:20,100
That's not what I want to see you do a 
half hour.

1694
01:14:20,101 --> 01:14:25,101
I want to see you do 40.
I think at a certain point in time I'm 

1695
01:14:25,101 --> 01:14:25,101
done.
You know,

1696
01:14:25,101 --> 01:14:25,101
I'm,
I'm,

1697
01:14:25,101 --> 01:14:29,650
I'm cool.
If someone wants to do 50 minutes of 

1698
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:29,650
hard shit,
you know,

1699
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:29,650
I don't mind.
I don't mind that,

1700
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:33,621
but I really like a long set.
Like when you get into a guy and he 

1701
01:14:33,621 --> 01:14:35,070
started laughing at is stuff you want to
keep laughing,

1702
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:35,750
you know,
you want to keep,

1703
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,410
you want to keep going,
you want them to keep going.

1704
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:40,800
Like a norton.
I saw Norton in Austin and he had like a

1705
01:14:40,801 --> 01:14:42,000
50 minute set.
I was like,

1706
01:14:42,001 --> 01:14:42,920
wow,
that's like a,

1707
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:47,930
that's like almost like a perfect time 
because he had like two guys go on 

1708
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:50,910
before him and he fucking devastated for
50 minutes and then after the 15 minutes

1709
01:14:50,911 --> 01:14:52,740
was over,
it's like you felt like perfect.

1710
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,360
Like it was.
He just nailed it.

1711
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,240
He blast.
It's like an episode of game of thrones.

1712
01:14:57,241 --> 01:14:58,550
It's about 50 minutes,
you know,

1713
01:14:58,551 --> 01:14:59,680
it's not really an hour.
It's like,

1714
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:03,420
just blast you with hilarious shit and 
then you're like,

1715
01:15:03,421 --> 01:15:05,100
that was great.
It was like the perfect amount.

1716
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:11,120
There's just like a balance.
They're trying to find the perfect 

1717
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:11,120
amount.
How much is too much?

1718
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:11,190
How much?
A little too little.

1719
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,900
But those 10 minutes are always a 
little.

1720
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,310
It's hard.
It's not bad for you.

1721
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:15,690
No,
no,

1722
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:16,390
no.
I love it.

1723
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:21,391
I love it.
I love going to the local places doing 

1724
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:21,520
15 or something just to get out of the 
fucking house.

1725
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:23,860
I was at the last two nights and I had a
blast.

1726
01:15:23,861 --> 01:15:28,300
I went to to like,
I went through my spot orange and packed

1727
01:15:28,301 --> 01:15:33,301
with that squad people.
People brought pictures of chimps I'm 

1728
01:15:33,301 --> 01:15:34,390
sure.
Had a fucking sandwich.

1729
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:39,391
Bach and he believed the sandwiches.
I've told you about this place before 

1730
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,950
and then last night I went to a place.
No,

1731
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:43,630
amber,
this place was on fucking fire bucket.

1732
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:47,440
Was somebody on a balcony?
Oh No.

1733
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:52,330
Fuck it outside.
Outside on the third floor.

1734
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:57,420
Wow.
It's like the second night they did it 

1735
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:57,420
like once a month.
Who was with you?

1736
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:57,420
By myself.
They call me.

1737
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,040
Like yesterday we had a four.
I was that.

1738
01:15:59,060 --> 01:15:59,680
What was that?
Like?

1739
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:04,710
Tremendous 30 minutes.
I was home by 1130 and it's all people 

1740
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:04,710
coming out to see you.

1741
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:05,140
Mixed.
Mixed,

1742
01:16:05,141 --> 01:16:07,290
you know,
like local guys put together and Shit.

1743
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:12,690
It's amazing that some weeks I stayed 
home and some ways I go this week I'm 

1744
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:15,760
going out five nights just to feel what 
that's like and I'll do five nights with

1745
01:16:15,761 --> 01:16:17,620
the Friday being the highlight of the 
joke.

1746
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,170
Now I'll take Saturday off.
I'm home or something.

1747
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,270
I stayed home with whatever the fuck,
you know what I'm saying?

1748
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,550
Some nights I like doing that.
Some weeks,

1749
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:27,660
Tuesday night did something really cool.
I did red sting.

1750
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:30,280
Oh,
the storyteller show at the theater with

1751
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:34,150
the comedy central and it was,
it was good to see her brother.

1752
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:37,630
That was his baby.
You know what I'm saying?

1753
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:41,650
He's filling in for comedy central now.
So it was when he called me,

1754
01:16:41,651 --> 01:16:46,651
he was embarrassed about what does this.
I don't care if it goes on comedy 

1755
01:16:46,651 --> 01:16:46,651
central Dot Com.
Okay.

1756
01:16:46,651 --> 01:16:48,460
Have a fucking embarrassed.
You know,

1757
01:16:48,461 --> 01:16:49,330
I could just see.
He was like,

1758
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:50,440
he thought it.
He thought he was gonna.

1759
01:16:50,441 --> 01:16:51,910
Call me like what?
Carnegie Hall Gig.

1760
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,480
Know what I'm saying?
And it was beautiful job.

1761
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:59,680
If they're going to put it on comedy 
central and we'll get a lot of years to 

1762
01:16:59,680 --> 01:16:59,950
see that.
He put this together,

1763
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:02,190
this was,
he had two sets work that,

1764
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,330
you know,
the camera he had makeup on.

1765
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:07,450
He wasn't neurotic Jew.
He wasn't mumbling.

1766
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:09,800
Ari's legit.
Now he is very

1767
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:10,420
bridget

1768
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:14,260
and it's really weird to see a guy that 
really paid his dues.

1769
01:17:14,261 --> 01:17:19,261
I saw him when we got to the store,
he would sit back there like a nerdy 

1770
01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:22,801
motherfucker with that hair cut one day,
bust out with like 90 percent 

1771
01:17:22,801 --> 01:17:26,140
commercials and the whole time he was 
going out and

1772
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:29,970
fucking everything and we got 
hemorrhoids in his ass.

1773
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:34,980
Remember this shit the size of a finger 
we started taking on the road was like,

1774
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,220
wow.
What year was it?

1775
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:40,950
That early.
Let me start taking 2005.

1776
01:17:40,951 --> 01:17:43,020
I'm sorry.
It was way earlier.

1777
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,220
Yeah,
way later than that.

1778
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,060
No,
I think.

1779
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:50,220
No,
I think it was before 2006 because I 

1780
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:52,620
remember it was a Mike Young,
couldn't make a Gig and Ari came instead

1781
01:17:52,621 --> 01:17:57,621
of her and yeah,
in Denver and he fucking destroyed and 

1782
01:17:57,621 --> 01:17:58,890
he was only doing comedy a few years 
back then,

1783
01:17:59,090 --> 01:17:59,720
you know,
but to,

1784
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:00,410
to him,
like I said,

1785
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:05,500
I think it was probably the biggest 
crowd he'd ever had and then like his 

1786
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:10,250
development from then on really a lot of
it was like going up in front of these 

1787
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,270
giant crowds.
Like he went from like open mics to like

1788
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:16,380
doing these sold out gigs and in between
he would do the store,

1789
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:21,620
you know,
and are we went like in front of our 

1790
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:23,781
eyes from being like a guy just starting
out to being like a fucking legit 

1791
01:18:23,781 --> 01:18:27,920
headline that I would go see.
Like if I was in like say if I lived in 

1792
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,181
a town,
if I lived in Utah or some shit like 

1793
01:18:32,181 --> 01:18:32,210
that and it was going to wiseguys I 
would go see are like that.

1794
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,490
Like I'm a comedy fan.
I would,

1795
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:35,160
I would go see that.
And that's,

1796
01:18:35,161 --> 01:18:36,630
it's,
it's crazy to watch.

1797
01:18:36,631 --> 01:18:41,631
It's crazy to watch crazy.
It's crazy to watch it happen to 

1798
01:18:41,631 --> 01:18:41,631
Youtube,
man.

1799
01:18:41,631 --> 01:18:41,631
It's,
it's,

1800
01:18:41,631 --> 01:18:44,640
it's in Dunkin as well.
It's crazy how much it means to me now,

1801
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:46,670
like in the early when

1802
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:48,700
I was here didn't mean to me enough now 
like,

1803
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:50,420
no,
I have to sit down and write it out.

1804
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:53,210
I have to really think about it.
I have to think about my thoughts.

1805
01:18:53,211 --> 01:18:56,450
I've been thinking about because I don't
want people to be disappointed,

1806
01:18:56,930 --> 01:19:01,930
you know?
I don't want to write material that's 

1807
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:01,930
bad for me.
I want it to be,

1808
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:01,930
you know.
Right.

1809
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:03,260
You have been my thing and 
responsibility.

1810
01:19:03,261 --> 01:19:05,060
I'm the same way.
I want to do 50 minutes,

1811
01:19:05,061 --> 01:19:10,061
an hour when I'm going to be out.
I want to smoke dope and drink some 

1812
01:19:10,061 --> 01:19:10,450
fucking water,
whatever.

1813
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:11,330
I,
I just,

1814
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:13,550
uh,
it's been a real pleasure lately.

1815
01:19:13,551 --> 01:19:15,830
It's been a real.
The whole twitter,

1816
01:19:15,831 --> 01:19:19,520
the whole writing.
It really has fucking made me sharp.

1817
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:24,890
The podcasting,
the fucking podcast and gets to a 

1818
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:24,890
different level now.
Yeah.

1819
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:29,381
We got on here now.
I can listen to a podcast now for 15 

1820
01:19:29,381 --> 01:19:29,720
minutes and I can tell what's good and 
bad.

1821
01:19:29,721 --> 01:19:32,390
It's radio wish.
When we do a podcast,

1822
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:35,270
they tap into a conversation.
It's like walking in,

1823
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,620
sitting down and going,
I'm right here,

1824
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:39,350
my sandwich,
and next thing you know,

1825
01:19:39,351 --> 01:19:41,270
you just listening and learning.
Well,

1826
01:19:41,271 --> 01:19:44,620
it's like they get to see you in the 
most real estate environment

1827
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:49,620
possible.
Like the the most surreal you possible 

1828
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,040
like I don't feel represented by and 
things at 140 characters.

1829
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,350
Like when I write things on twitter,
a lot of times I run.

1830
01:19:53,351 --> 01:19:53,770
I'm like,
oh,

1831
01:19:53,771 --> 01:19:55,750
how's that going to be conveyed?
You know what I mean?

1832
01:19:55,751 --> 01:19:57,170
It's only 140 characters.
When you.

1833
01:19:57,171 --> 01:20:00,790
When I hear you say something,
I know exactly what you're saying.

1834
01:20:00,791 --> 01:20:03,130
I know where it's coming from anew.
Your inflection,

1835
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,230
your pause,
the seriousness in your voice,

1836
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,020
the intensity in your tone,
whenever,

1837
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,480
whatever it is.
I know what you're saying.

1838
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,730
It's hard to express yourself on 
twitter,

1839
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:14,760
but on the podcast,
that's where people grow to love human.

1840
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:19,820
Then they see.
They hear that voice on twitter when 

1841
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:19,820
they read your tweets,
they know you,

1842
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:19,940
they know your voice.
I mean,

1843
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:22,470
you know who you are,
so they see that in your twenties.

1844
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:23,460
Then it works.

1845
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:26,880
But it's a lot of things on twitter,
like people,

1846
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:29,290
people.
I had an issue this week or um,

1847
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:30,240
uh,
people,

1848
01:20:30,241 --> 01:20:31,530
uh,
I've had a few,

1849
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:35,670
but uh,
people keep getting upset at things that

1850
01:20:35,671 --> 01:20:39,030
are right on twitter that I think are 
pretty obvious jokes.

1851
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:40,200
Yeah.
They kind of Douchey,

1852
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:42,990
like kind of like I said about something
about male vegans.

1853
01:20:42,991 --> 01:20:43,540
I said,
uh,

1854
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:45,840
if you're a male,
if you call yourself a male Vegan,

1855
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,130
I hope you choked.
No,

1856
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,750
not male vegans.
Excuse me.

1857
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:50,340
Excuse me.
Male feminists.

1858
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,710
I said that if you call yourself a male 
feminist,

1859
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:54,900
I hope you choke to death on Vegan 
Pizza,

1860
01:20:54,901 --> 01:20:57,600
like crying to a lady Gaga Song.
Okay.

1861
01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:59,370
I'm just joking.
All right.

1862
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,960
We fucking lax.
I'm 140 characters.

1863
01:21:03,961 --> 01:21:05,520
When you say something like that,
people like,

1864
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:10,550
oh,
he hates all male feminists or 

1865
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:12,770
feminists,
or he's a chauvinist or something like 

1866
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:12,770
that.
It's like,

1867
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:12,770
no,
but let's be honest.

1868
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:15,420
How many guys that you talked to that 
are male feminists are really annoying?

1869
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:17,550
How many?
It's most of them.

1870
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,610
Most guys who are male feminists are 
really annoying.

1871
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:22,980
Well,
there's been a few.

1872
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:23,790
There's what?
Listen,

1873
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,830
the ideals behind it,
nothing wrong with it.

1874
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:31,010
The ideal.
We get some more of those corvette 

1875
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:31,010
things and some of the cocoa cafes.
Man,

1876
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:31,190
those are the shit.
Yeah,

1877
01:21:31,191 --> 01:21:33,660
I have a cookbook cafe,
but this,

1878
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:35,310
um,
the tweet,

1879
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:36,840
I just,
first of all,

1880
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:39,630
it all started out.
I got pissed off and I talked about this

1881
01:21:39,631 --> 01:21:40,830
a little bit on the ice house 
chronicles.

1882
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:46,070
So there was some lady that was saying 
nasty shit about kids like didn't like 

1883
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:48,951
kids and started wrote on twitter that I
view women who don't like kids the same 

1884
01:21:48,951 --> 01:21:50,910
way I view dogs that like to eat,
throwing shit.

1885
01:21:51,170 --> 01:21:52,080
Like that's how I look at him.

1886
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:52,430
Like,
Oh,

1887
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,970
what is that?
You know,

1888
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:59,240
it was just,
it was just being a fly on the wall 

1889
01:21:59,240 --> 01:21:59,240
during a shitty conversation.
Right?

1890
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,080
So I write that down on twitter and then
people get angry at me.

1891
01:22:01,081 --> 01:22:02,820
Like you're equating women too.
Shit,

1892
01:22:02,821 --> 01:22:04,740
eating dogs.
And No,

1893
01:22:04,741 --> 01:22:09,741
not exactly.
I mean yes and not exactly what I'm 

1894
01:22:09,741 --> 01:22:12,621
basically saying is it's kind of a gross
thing when someone doesn't like kids and

1895
01:22:12,901 --> 01:22:14,880
that's what I was feeling at the time,
but I didn't know.

1896
01:22:14,881 --> 01:22:18,450
I probably shouldn't have wrote women.
I probably should've wrote men.

1897
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:23,480
I didn't think about it because it was 
actually a woman who was doing it and I 

1898
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,440
always like it when I see women that 
like kids especially because I have kids

1899
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:28,260
and women that like kids are like cute 
to the kids and it's kind of fun.

1900
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:32,090
But I should've said people and not,
you know,

1901
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:36,030
men or women and I should have probably 
said hate instead of not like.

1902
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:36,990
Because people were saying,
oh,

1903
01:22:36,991 --> 01:22:40,110
like if women don't want to have 
children and they're pieces of shit that

1904
01:22:40,111 --> 01:22:41,400
had nothing to do with it.
What I meant,

1905
01:22:41,401 --> 01:22:43,590
I don't care if a woman doesn't want to 
have kids,

1906
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:45,450
you should absolutely be able to do 
whatever you want to do.

1907
01:22:45,451 --> 01:22:48,270
And I could totally understand not 
wanting to take on the responsibility of

1908
01:22:48,271 --> 01:22:49,140
kids.
If you're a woman.

1909
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:52,920
That's not what I'm saying.
I don't mean doesn't want to have one.

1910
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,260
What I meant was doesn't like them.
That's it.

1911
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,950
Like people don't like to like fucking 
kids away from me.

1912
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,980
That's creepy.
It irks me.

1913
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,990
It irks me with anybody,
with men or women.

1914
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,340
But I saw a woman it.
So I tweeted about that.

1915
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:11,580
Then I started getting all these white 
knight feminists dudes that were giving 

1916
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:11,580
me a hard time.
I'm like,

1917
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:13,690
man,
you weak bitches.

1918
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,710
You better shut your mouth.
He's silly.

1919
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,430
Fuck.
So it was just like over and over again,

1920
01:23:19,431 --> 01:23:21,400
this nonsense about,
you know,

1921
01:23:21,401 --> 01:23:26,401
this,
this contributes to violence against 

1922
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:26,401
women and your attitudes or misogynistic
and like,

1923
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:28,930
well I'm talking about someone who 
doesn't like kids.

1924
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,580
That's it.
That's all I'm saying.

1925
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:36,030
You know,
and I'm standing in 140 characters and 

1926
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:38,971
maybe it's like,
it's just a stupid way to say anything 

1927
01:23:38,971 --> 01:23:38,971
controversial.
You know,

1928
01:23:38,971 --> 01:23:40,690
maybe twitter if you don't want to be 
misunderstood.

1929
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:42,880
And if you don't want to have to explain
yourself,

1930
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:45,120
don't say anything controversial,
you know,

1931
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:50,130
because anything.
Because people look easy because it's 

1932
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:52,270
such a limited form of expression.
They can all of a sudden imply all sorts

1933
01:23:52,271 --> 01:23:57,271
of meaning to it and then write,
hold blogs about this implied meaning 

1934
01:23:57,271 --> 01:24:01,860
they all of a sudden have like this 
whole cause and all they're doing is 

1935
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:05,041
misinterpreting an original statement,
but because it's so narrow and its 

1936
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:06,040
definition,
because it's only 140 characters,

1937
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:11,190
there's so much room for them 
bullshitting and coming up with their 

1938
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:11,190
own meaning and now.

1939
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:15,900
So it's good because like,
I had a bunch of feminists write blogs 

1940
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:15,900
about me.
It was hilarious,

1941
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:19,651
like reading all this,
like my massage mystic attitudes and 

1942
01:24:19,651 --> 01:24:23,011
this and that,
like that's about as far from the truth 

1943
01:24:23,011 --> 01:24:23,011
as I hope,
you know,

1944
01:24:23,011 --> 01:24:27,340
I always try to be as,
as open to everybody as possible.

1945
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:29,400
I like being a man,
but uh,

1946
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:32,380
I don't have any problem with anybody 
just because they're a woman.

1947
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:37,381
I think that's completely ridiculous.
I think though that there's a lot of 

1948
01:24:37,841 --> 01:24:39,220
fuckery in this world,
man.

1949
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,590
And there's a,
there's a lot of people that are full of

1950
01:24:41,591 --> 01:24:43,780
shit on both sides of the fence.
Hail Satan,

1951
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:47,520
that Hail Satan thing.
Yeah,

1952
01:24:47,521 --> 01:24:52,521
that's A.
Duncan had this thing he did for her 

1953
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:55,680
wedding and Tom Lava,
that internal event and that's it,

1954
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:56,140
right?
Yeah.

1955
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,390
And he was uh,
he asked me to,

1956
01:24:58,391 --> 01:25:02,560
uh,
do a devil horns and where his tee shirt

1957
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:04,180
and look at the,
take a picture.

1958
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:07,680
It was a cool wedding and music was 
played there with a.

1959
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,760
what's that guy?
The Hank Williams.

1960
01:25:09,761 --> 01:25:10,270
The third one?

1961
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:15,320
Yeah.
I didn't get to meet the other guy 

1962
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:15,320
wanted to meet him because I love the 
wonderful white to West Virginia.

1963
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,620
But anyway,
you know,

1964
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:21,860
he goes,
well you wear my shirt and do the devil 

1965
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:21,860
horns.
Were like,

1966
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:21,860
yeah,
fuck it dude.

1967
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:21,960
I'll do it.
And then I got all these people.

1968
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:25,410
St Joe Rogan is a satanist that is for 
real.

1969
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:29,130
That is the dumbest form of Satan is 
like you really thinking that,

1970
01:25:29,131 --> 01:25:33,180
that satanism me standing there with a,
a tribute.

1971
01:25:33,181 --> 01:25:34,500
What does it say?
Attribute to what

1972
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:39,310
a tribute to six,
six,

1973
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:39,900
six,
six,

1974
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:40,830
six,
whatever.

1975
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:46,080
What you're also saying,
your tattoos have satanic things and 

1976
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,150
I've been seeing a lot of crazy things 
lately where it's like your left arm I 

1977
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:52,620
think has like some kind of a satanic 
snake on it or something.

1978
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:57,530
Fucking dragon to represent my ferocious
spirit son.

1979
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:03,280
Shame of people don't.
People will take the time to acknowledge

1980
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:04,040
that shit and can

1981
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,660
blow it up,
you know,

1982
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:08,500
but also no,
shut up.

1983
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:10,610
Right.
But it's also people on both ends,

1984
01:26:10,611 --> 01:26:15,611
like you choosing to get upset about 
some really ridiculous should read a 

1985
01:26:15,611 --> 01:26:15,680
tweet and you go to that person's paid 
and you go,

1986
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:19,980
I get it.
Once I read some tweet and I go to their

1987
01:26:19,981 --> 01:26:21,980
main page,
I can put.

1988
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:23,870
I can add up right in one minute ago.
I get it.

1989
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:27,050
I get where he was coming from.
I understand why you said that.

1990
01:26:27,051 --> 01:26:28,160
He's a musician.
He's Dad,

1991
01:26:28,161 --> 01:26:30,260
he's a politician.
He sells this.

1992
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:33,130
He likes.
Like today somebody hit me and I ran.

1993
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:34,880
He was a poor riser fan.
I get it.

1994
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,910
You're a fucking book.
You know what I'm saying?

1995
01:26:36,911 --> 01:26:41,911
I've never met a poor riser fan,
so if you shoot yourself in the fucking 

1996
01:26:41,911 --> 01:26:45,410
mouth right now,
you want somebody.

1997
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:49,730
If I go to some of these pains and I see
like music and I know the music sucks,

1998
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:53,000
that's where it ends because of his 
choice and music sucks.

1999
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:55,640
That's what if I don't see fucking one 
of my three on that,

2000
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:58,010
like I'm going to go into people's.
There's two things.

2001
01:26:58,011 --> 01:27:03,011
I judge people.
I don't judge people by money and not 

2002
01:27:03,011 --> 01:27:03,011
legit people.
That music collection.

2003
01:27:03,011 --> 01:27:06,680
If I look at your collection and you 
don't have sabbath paranoid if you don't

2004
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:11,681
have the staples Zeplin too.
Those are the staples Zeplin to why 

2005
01:27:11,681 --> 01:27:13,090
we're here.
Why are you?

2006
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:16,370
Why are you wasting my fucking time?
I'm over here.

2007
01:27:16,371 --> 01:27:19,160
You got like 30 grand.
You know what I'm saying?

2008
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:20,360
That's.
And number two,

2009
01:27:20,361 --> 01:27:21,800
when you open up some of these 
refrigerated,

2010
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:23,120
there's certain.
Yeah,

2011
01:27:23,121 --> 01:27:24,200
it's true.
You Open.

2012
01:27:24,201 --> 01:27:26,150
That tells me everything.
If you're a fucking move,

2013
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,670
if you're a month,
if I see like low and beer,

2014
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:33,680
your fucking ain't never coming in and 
there's certain people that they have 

2015
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,760
music laying around just because it's 
cool,

2016
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:35,750
but tons of them.

2017
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:40,750
That's why the generation of people that
want to say,

2018
01:27:40,971 --> 01:27:44,180
and I know this and I don't hate you 
because I'm kind of in the same way that

2019
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:49,220
they don't want to like floyd.
They prefer to listen to,

2020
01:27:49,221 --> 01:27:54,221
oh,
that's so commercialize that into more 

2021
01:27:54,221 --> 01:27:54,221
receipt.
You know,

2022
01:27:54,221 --> 01:27:57,080
that make me feel bad.
The worst being the Tom Waits era,

2023
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:03,070
those motherfuckers are ones I want to 
punch him right in the fucking face 

2024
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:06,820
because they're the ones.
You're having a good time listening to 

2025
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:09,071
something.
You're bobbing and they want to like 

2026
01:28:09,071 --> 01:28:09,071
really impress like some fucking dumped 
check with fractals and southern.

2027
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,780
Everybody's fucked already.
Don't know what I'm saying.

2028
01:28:11,781 --> 01:28:16,781
Everybody fucked.
All you need is Tequila and a gram of 

2029
01:28:16,781 --> 01:28:16,781
blown she'll be sucking your dick in the
fucking bathroom.

2030
01:28:16,781 --> 01:28:20,860
You want to be cool and let Tom Weigh 
heavy weight.

2031
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,300
That's good.
Second,

2032
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:26,870
you want that.
You're a fucking idiot,

2033
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:32,080
but the only reason that people would 
put that shit on is to try to overpower 

2034
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,590
you with that fucking star wars.
What do you call that?

2035
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,130
The fucking thing with the mind.
Generous.

2036
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:38,810
That's it.
Oh,

2037
01:28:38,811 --> 01:28:40,200
he's so.
Oh my God.

2038
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:45,220
He likes to listen to that.
They're trying to let me sit you down 

2039
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:45,410
with a gun next to your head.
You're telling me.

2040
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:48,260
That's good.
That's good.

2041
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:50,390
Fucking second.
Beatles.

2042
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:54,570
Y'All fucking shoot.
You can put a gun to your bucket.

2043
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:56,510
All right.
Telling me that's good music.

2044
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,670
You fucking 20 years old.
Not at all.

2045
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:00,980
Like when somebody says,
I like the Dave Matthews band.

2046
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:06,110
I will pistol whip you with.
You have satellite on the way up here.

2047
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:12,750
Says to me they wouldn't do an accident 
by Bob Marley.

2048
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:17,370
I almost crashed out a white dude with 
no shoes on.

2049
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:19,680
A black new planner.
If fucking it's too.

2050
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:22,620
It's too made up.
Uncle Joey stop it.

2051
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:25,650
I think he's got some good songs.
Dave Matthews got a few good,

2052
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:27,090
so hopefully she got me emotional.

2053
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:31,440
Fuck this shit.
I was too quiet over there.

2054
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:35,010
I hate all that shit.
You don't like to just move over.

2055
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:38,220
I can't stand fucking time with and the 
people like Tom Waits,

2056
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:43,310
look at them and go to that page and 
it'll tell you the whole thing like 

2057
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:43,310
that.
That something ain't right,

2058
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:45,310
that vegans something.
Then,

2059
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:46,940
you know,
stop the pill.

2060
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,020
Pilgrims they care for something that 
you're like,

2061
01:29:49,021 --> 01:29:50,340
really?
I always like to.

2062
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:52,860
Tom Waits is a guy who probably has a 
song that I would like,

2063
01:29:52,861 --> 01:29:54,440
but I don't want to go find it.
Oh,

2064
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:56,780
it's probably like one or two songs.
One Song.

2065
01:29:57,050 --> 01:29:59,640
Pick a fucking song,
pick a song.

2066
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:03,510
And it sounds like he's taking a shit.
It sounds like a dude.

2067
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:08,640
What the fuck is this?
More on singing and I know people going,

2068
01:30:08,641 --> 01:30:10,260
oh my God,
he's a revolution.

2069
01:30:10,261 --> 01:30:12,650
And I know Paul Mccartney.
He's a bad motherfucker.

2070
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:14,010
Why?
He's alive.

2071
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,160
Everybody else was dead.
Paul Mccartney won this war.

2072
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,290
That's true.
Joe Harris is dead.

2073
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:23,310
Everybody's dead.
Michael Jackson's dead dead.

2074
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,640
Paul Mccartney still,
even his wife,

2075
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:28,830
he killed the fucking.
Blew the Lipton chick.

2076
01:30:28,831 --> 01:30:32,700
What did her parents own?
Fucking Kodak Shit,

2077
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:34,020
man.
When he moved to,

2078
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:35,680
he didn't know.
He drove it again,

2079
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:37,470
a fucking sandwich.
He died in a car.

2080
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,120
Remember dog,
nobody.

2081
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:44,121
Fuck.
Then he had the one with the missing 

2082
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:44,121
leg.
Courtney lives one.

2083
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:47,020
This fucking game.
We beat out one.

2084
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,880
Everybody's McCartney outlived 
everybody.

2085
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:50,970
The only one.
Him,

2086
01:30:50,971 --> 01:30:53,520
Elton John Bowlby,
Mick Jagger.

2087
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:58,550
Which you don't even want to fuck with 
all those other guys think Mick 

2088
01:30:58,550 --> 01:30:58,550
Jagger's.
Filthy motherfucker ain't today.

2089
01:30:58,550 --> 01:30:59,610
God,
I hate that motherfucker.

2090
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:02,370
Just look at them.
You want to just wrangle mcjagger.

2091
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:05,610
Why Mick Jagger's a different dudes.
You know Mick Jagger,

2092
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:08,040
Mick Jagger.
What was his background?

2093
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:09,960
I don't know.
Like look at his background,

2094
01:31:09,961 --> 01:31:10,510
his background.

2095
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:12,360
He went to like the best business 
school.

2096
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:14,190
You know that really?
Yeah.

2097
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:19,220
In England.
Like he's like a fucking wizard 

2098
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:19,220
economist or something.
This story.

2099
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:23,601
Yeah.
He don't do nothing unless you show up 

2100
01:31:23,601 --> 01:31:23,601
with a big bag book.
I know in Boulder,

2101
01:31:23,601 --> 01:31:25,170
I,
we talking about this in the podcast one

2102
01:31:25,171 --> 01:31:26,420
time in boulder,
you know,

2103
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:30,130
out in conscious the seats behind you 
shot him,

2104
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:33,840
but Mr Jagger,
nobody sells the tickets behind them.

2105
01:31:33,841 --> 01:31:35,900
They won't mind.
I'm Mick Jagger,

2106
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:39,900
those tickets so we don't go on stage.
You heard that new shit.

2107
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,520
It's horrible.
You sound that bad.

2108
01:31:41,521 --> 01:31:42,530
That new songs,
not the enemy.

2109
01:31:42,531 --> 01:31:47,531
It's not that.
And why would you put up?

2110
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,460
Let me see where I can find it.
Let's help them.

2111
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:51,780
Let's promote the rolling stones.

2112
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:56,600
How funny is that?
Yeah.

2113
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:58,260
It will help you out.
Rolling Stones.

2114
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:01,090
I know you need this.
You never read the little podcast.

2115
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:06,270
He's got a book.
He's got a book that somebody wrote 

2116
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:06,270
about them and they interview somebody.
Who's the chick that's in?

2117
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:09,840
You know you're so vain.
Carly Simon.

2118
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:14,920
Carly Simon sat next to.
She was awesome at some movie premiere 

2119
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:15,290
or something.
Make Jack sat next to him was like,

2120
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:16,200
dog.
You gotta join.

2121
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:18,240
No,
you got a quaint little.

2122
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:19,470
You got a bump of coke.
No,

2123
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,280
about a blood job jacket.
Just killed.

2124
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:28,360
This guy married his wife and he married
in the country.

2125
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,730
We're fucking.
It wasn't even legal to be married.

2126
01:32:30,731 --> 01:32:33,760
This guy is one step ahead of the game.
All he gives a fuck.

2127
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:36,250
It's getting his dick suck.
He's 60 something.

2128
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:38,920
You think stallone shooting shit.
This guy.

2129
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:40,900
Oh,
bits lapse alone with his dick.

2130
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,890
This guy shooting everything,
he's got kids every six months ago.

2131
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:45,610
Fucks a new model.
How many kids?

2132
01:32:45,611 --> 01:32:47,590
Mick Jagger Guy.
I don't know how many kids.

2133
01:32:47,591 --> 01:32:51,580
You got to pull up a song.
It's called one more shot I think.

2134
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:56,640
Hold on a second.
It's got that on the get this band from 

2135
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,020
Youtube.
Nobody.

2136
01:32:58,910 --> 01:33:01,930
Nobody's slung.
Listen will chamberlain.

2137
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:04,750
He fucked over 100 or whatever thousand 
women,

2138
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:10,110
but I believe nobody fuck more women 
than Sinatra and Mick Jagger like that.

2139
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:14,500
That we can only play one little excerpt
of it.

2140
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,520
Not even like a little really damn 
youtube.

2141
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:21,400
That's why we need to work something out
with Youtube.

2142
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,220
Youtube.
Hook us up with the new stones is good.

2143
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:27,430
Not Bad man.
At least like a song,

2144
01:33:27,431 --> 01:33:29,950
but I don't know what.
No more stones.

2145
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:34,180
The stones are the biggest business 
merger ever released.

2146
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:38,440
Six old songs and two new ones and they 
bang it out for another 1995.

2147
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:39,760
Dude.
Um,

2148
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:42,670
when he came back or when it was like,
what is it?

2149
01:33:42,671 --> 01:33:46,090
Like 90,
89,

2150
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:49,270
89 90.
They had like one big hit again.

2151
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:52,030
What was that one big hat they had?
Okay,

2152
01:33:52,031 --> 01:33:56,290
so 81 was shattered and all that and 
then after that it was the other one.

2153
01:33:56,291 --> 01:33:58,370
They took some time off and the came 
back.

2154
01:33:58,570 --> 01:34:01,030
Neighbors not that out that it kept 
going.

2155
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:02,920
You guys like Bruce Springsteen?
No,

2156
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:06,440
thank God that I'm from Jersey.
I want to stop that motherfucker too.

2157
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:08,070
Yeah,
I like some brief.

2158
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,770
I liked the first.
I ain't gonna lie.

2159
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:15,010
I like 10th avenue freeze out.
I like a darkness on the edge of town,

2160
01:34:15,011 --> 01:34:17,740
but after that,
born in the USA with a pe shirt,

2161
01:34:17,741 --> 01:34:20,140
him jumping up and down casually tracks.
Fuck.

2162
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:25,450
You know what I'm saying?
Out The ball on what the fuck.

2163
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:33,180
Well that's kind of for our show.
I don't give up after two hours I got to

2164
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:38,170
get out of it was I'm fine.
He's like the special people on the east

2165
01:34:38,171 --> 01:34:43,171
coast that really emotionals songwriting
some great fucking songs.

2166
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:46,180
Thunder road.
That is.

2167
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:53,900
But this is what happens.
What happens is when a guy gets like 

2168
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:56,911
super famous,
it's really hard to keep up that 

2169
01:34:56,911 --> 01:34:59,101
struggle and so you sort of become at 
least a partial parody of yourself.

2170
01:34:59,330 --> 01:35:01,370
Have you seen them lately?
Them that fucked up at night.

2171
01:35:01,371 --> 01:35:04,960
This is a fucking marine is beautiful.
He gets on my last bid.

2172
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:08,450
If the guy to me still,
he was going to run.

2173
01:35:08,451 --> 01:35:09,680
Man.
I love all that shit,

2174
01:35:09,681 --> 01:35:12,550
but enough already take them in time and
they told him he comes out.

2175
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:17,650
What doing.
He gets on my last fucking type dude.

2176
01:35:25,611 --> 01:35:26,720
Anyway,
motherfucker.

2177
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:30,470
And by Jovi,
Bon Jovi,

2178
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:37,250
Jovi 87.
Slippery when wet boy dead or alive.

2179
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:42,280
You guys are talking shit because born 
to run is a thousand times better than 

2180
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:46,301
any of those songs.
So to run this tremendous,

2181
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:50,520
tremendous trouble.
Bruce Sprint.

2182
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:52,040
But I'll tell you what,
bruce springsteen,

2183
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,560
when he had that,
the divorce,

2184
01:35:55,100 --> 01:36:00,100
then he came out with some jamming music
man because he like felt like really 

2185
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:01,190
like broken hearted over this.

2186
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:04,160
You know him and this chick break it up.
So he came up with that brilliant.

2187
01:36:04,161 --> 01:36:07,040
The Sky Song.
That's a great fucking song.

2188
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:11,120
That is a great fucking song.
He came back with some strong shit after

2189
01:36:11,121 --> 01:36:13,540
that chick crushed them.
Little girl.

2190
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:19,400
We can manage it.
No one would ever make that song today.

2191
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:24,530
Hey,
little girl.

2192
01:36:24,531 --> 01:36:26,540
Is Your Daddy home?
I had a bad desire.

2193
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:29,980
What this?
Who the fuck would make that song today?

2194
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:32,690
Couldn't do that song in the age of the 
Internet.

2195
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:37,720
They would crucify you.
They would go after you did the fake 

2196
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,870
Rick Ross last reebok as a sponsor.
Did you hear about that?

2197
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:40,190
Oh really?
Yeah.

2198
01:36:40,410 --> 01:36:42,260
That's so ridiculous.
Sacred for us.

2199
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:47,380
Made a some rhetoric about rape.
Dosing them with molly.

2200
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,000
Put Molly in their drink it.
You didn't even know it.

2201
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:53,660
You know something along those lines and
banging asleep.

2202
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:57,680
Why would I ever have the desire to 
Malia check or give it chicken roofing?

2203
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:00,410
I'm a dirty animal.
Because you got game son.

2204
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,030
No,
that's true.

2205
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:03,980
I would have to check if you want to eat
a roofie.

2206
01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:08,030
I had like,
I had this little Jew than both of us.

2207
01:37:08,050 --> 01:37:10,160
She will need roofs on Sundays with me 
and we freak.

2208
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,670
She wouldn't let me fucking beat her ass
and 69.

2209
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:19,030
It was wild,
but she know she had like a boyfriend 

2210
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:19,030
that was in the navy or something.
Oh,

2211
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:20,530
that's hilarious.
And she kept hope alive.

2212
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:21,620
Uh,
we'd go out,

2213
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:24,330
we'd have roofing.
We split a roofie because she liked them

2214
01:37:24,331 --> 01:37:29,331
too.
We had to go to the legal road right at 

2215
01:37:29,331 --> 01:37:29,331
the corner.
It was like a,

2216
01:37:29,331 --> 01:37:30,140
it was like an industrial park of that.
Some dude like sheet rock.

2217
01:37:30,290 --> 01:37:32,300
Sheet rock is sheet metal and he sold 
roofie.

2218
01:37:32,301 --> 01:37:34,880
She drove me up there.
A couple of roofers.

2219
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:36,470
We popped on the Lord's Day.

2220
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:41,470
We split the fucking roof.
We'd go have a couple of Margarita and 

2221
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:41,470
talk about bad Karma,
man.

2222
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:41,780
You're selling roofing.
It's just here.

2223
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:45,800
Go ahead and do it.
But I was responsible with the roof,

2224
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:46,310
like,
like,

2225
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:47,000
no,
no,

2226
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:47,690
no,
I couldn't.

2227
01:37:47,691 --> 01:37:50,900
I'm saying the guy who was selling 
couldn't imagine doing that to a check.

2228
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:52,430
It's not.
I'll work hard for it.

2229
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:57,640
I'll take it home with an eight ball and
then switch it up on you and give you 

2230
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:57,640
aspects them.
You Suck my Dick.

2231
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:58,920
You know what,
I'll run you through the fucking rules.

2232
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:03,060
Egyptians don't give a fuck,
but I can't see that.

2233
01:38:03,061 --> 01:38:05,540
I can never see root sweetie.
You,

2234
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:10,550
Joey.
I'm telling you dog.

2235
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:12,930
I think rape is wrong.
I'm just saying,

2236
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:14,970
I just think it's wrong.
I mean,

2237
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,320
you know,
I can't believe you do it.

2238
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:23,020
Why can't even watch law and order Svu.
I love law and order that I can't watch 

2239
01:38:23,071 --> 01:38:24,820
it as 10 minutes on camera.

2240
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:25,940
Watch this shit.
Yeah,

2241
01:38:25,941 --> 01:38:26,770
that's your,
your,

2242
01:38:26,771 --> 01:38:31,771
you know,
we all know that happens after a while 

2243
01:38:31,771 --> 01:38:32,380
when you know that a certain amount of 
violent crime takes place.

2244
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:35,420
Then you watch him like bodies on TV.
Like I was watching it the other night.

2245
01:38:35,421 --> 01:38:40,421
It was at the airport and in the middle 
of the airport there they're playing 

2246
01:38:40,421 --> 01:38:43,991
this uh,
one of those shows like law and order 

2247
01:38:43,991 --> 01:38:43,991
Svu or something like that.
And I'm,

2248
01:38:43,991 --> 01:38:44,000
I'm,
I'm seeing like,

2249
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,860
like a body,
you know,

2250
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,490
and um,
um,

2251
01:38:46,610 --> 01:38:48,830
I don't know if it was a commercial,
I don't know what the fuck it was,

2252
01:38:48,831 --> 01:38:50,510
but I was like,
well that's pretty graphic.

2253
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:52,340
Like who?
Who wants to see that?

2254
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:57,370
Like who wants to see that now that I'm 
thinking about it was in an airport or 

2255
01:38:57,370 --> 01:38:59,330
is it in a store?
I think it was a store either way.

2256
01:38:59,490 --> 01:39:00,280
The the,
the,

2257
01:39:00,290 --> 01:39:03,090
the important thing is that like seeing 
those,

2258
01:39:03,091 --> 01:39:05,990
those images on those shows where 
they're repeating over and over and over

2259
01:39:05,991 --> 01:39:07,580
again.
They have always liked graphic images of

2260
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:12,610
bodies and pulling things out of bodies 
and it's like it's pretty intense that 

2261
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:16,691
you're.
You're taking that stuff into your 

2262
01:39:16,691 --> 01:39:16,691
psyche.
You're taking that stuff into your,

2263
01:39:16,691 --> 01:39:20,590
your bank of experiences.
I don't like sexual stuff on television 

2264
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:22,400
early.
He believed that the girls making out or

2265
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:25,400
let's say I'm watching Diane Sawyer and 
have like a condom commercial.

2266
01:39:25,401 --> 01:39:28,040
I'll fucking lose my mind.
A condom commercial will bother you.

2267
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:29,420
Oh,
it's a little pond.

2268
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:34,500
Really destroyed tampon commercial.
I want to choke myself and my wife was 

2269
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:37,520
in the room like your rants in the room 
with some older woman.

2270
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:40,400
I was a kid,
a Kotex commercial.

2271
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:42,410
I would sit down and look fucking 
straight ahead.

2272
01:39:42,411 --> 01:39:44,750
Dog.
I never get so embarrassed in my life.

2273
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:47,800
I don't want them to ask me if I know 
and I don't want to fuck the.

2274
01:39:47,801 --> 01:39:49,340
No.
The blood comes out.

2275
01:39:49,341 --> 01:39:49,550
Yes.

2276
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:50,190
What

2277
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,710
and what you pull up there.
That's got nothing to do with me.

2278
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:57,720
I'm just straight up.
Don't even bring it up.

2279
01:39:57,820 --> 01:39:59,950
You know there's some women that cute.
Yeah,

2280
01:40:00,190 --> 01:40:01,140
they think it's cute.
Like hold on.

2281
01:40:01,141 --> 01:40:02,280
I gotta go.
We gotta a Tampon.

2282
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:03,420
Listen,
I don't want to know.

2283
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:08,870
I don't want to love your bleed.
You've ruined everything for me and I 

2284
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:09,080
don't want to know.
That's a really volume at.

2285
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:10,830
That bothers me.
The sight of blood.

2286
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:11,580
No,
no,

2287
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:11,780
no,
no,

2288
01:40:11,781 --> 01:40:11,940
no,
no,

2289
01:40:11,941 --> 01:40:14,520
no.
I think decided talking about that.

2290
01:40:14,521 --> 01:40:19,521
You fucking pussies bleeding around me.
That's what I fucking hate when even 

2291
01:40:19,521 --> 01:40:20,160
when they haven't that purse.
I got sick to my stomach.

2292
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:25,610
I don't want to see a fucking tampon.
I don't want to fucking see a Tampon at 

2293
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:25,610
all.
Alright.

2294
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:28,140
When I'm watching TV and a tampon 
commercial comes up.

2295
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:30,840
Even when I'm by myself,
I feel creepy.

2296
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:33,780
That's so weird.
Calm and commercials.

2297
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:37,560
That new commercial with the chicken 
head popping out on the fucking thing.

2298
01:40:37,561 --> 01:40:42,561
Would you put on your finger,
have you seen that commercial chicken 

2299
01:40:42,561 --> 01:40:44,430
with the creepy finger try know this is 
great to relieve stress.

2300
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:46,530
You know what meant?
I don't want to know about that shit.

2301
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:48,930
What the fuck is that?

2302
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,540
The Zombie.
Oh my God.

2303
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:54,940
What is that?
Is was to put that away.

2304
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:57,460
That's broken.
That one's broken.

2305
01:40:57,490 --> 01:41:01,080
That is just that.
Don't even get that one fixed this day.

2306
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:04,110
Anything bacterial sprays,
anything bad.

2307
01:41:04,111 --> 01:41:08,260
General and television like 10:00
drives me up a fucking.

2308
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:11,450
I've never had a period problem.
Oh,

2309
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:16,480
I'll never had my own period.
Well I have my own period every now and 

2310
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:19,951
then,
but I've never had a like a period 

2311
01:41:19,951 --> 01:41:19,951
problem.
Like a problem with the girls,

2312
01:41:19,951 --> 01:41:19,951
period.
No,

2313
01:41:19,951 --> 01:41:24,920
it doesn't bother me at all.
I told you the one I had to his day and 

2314
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:28,560
it was fucked up because my mother had 
just died and it was the first time a 

2315
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,520
chick called me like that was my first 
booty call level.

2316
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:35,790
I had dated this girl before.
She was a cheerleader at Franklin 

2317
01:41:35,790 --> 01:41:38,431
school.
I played hoops at Mckinley and we had 

2318
01:41:38,431 --> 01:41:38,431
messed around a little bit.

2319
01:41:38,431 --> 01:41:38,890
Not really sex,
I don't remember Joe.

2320
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:41,590
I think I sucked at Teddy's.
I knew a brother,

2321
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:43,730
you know what I'm saying?
Like we were in grammar school,

2322
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:46,210
high school and I had sucked attendees 
or something.

2323
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:51,510
I have to like a dance or something and 
after my mother died I was home for a 

2324
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:55,800
week and this lady was taking care of me
and I get this call one night and it's 

2325
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:55,800
just chicken.
She goes,

2326
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:56,380
you know,
you want to get together.

2327
01:41:56,890 --> 01:41:58,120
I was feeling bad,
you know,

2328
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:00,550
I didn't know.
She just told me a little lottery pussy,

2329
01:42:00,551 --> 01:42:03,310
like my little funeral pussy out of a 
God funeral.

2330
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:04,420
Pushy.
But it exists,

2331
01:42:04,421 --> 01:42:05,800
you know funeral pussy.
Yeah.

2332
01:42:05,801 --> 01:42:08,650
Like after somebody dies in your family,
some chick causing such a dick.

2333
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:11,710
Really bad like that.
Like a,

2334
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:16,820
maybe like a,
like a women that hang out at comedy 

2335
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:16,820
clubs and these,
I call them groupies.

2336
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:20,290
They have sex with Pete.
After somebody dies,

2337
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:21,880
I'm serious.
But I knew her.

2338
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:27,210
She probably just called me out of the 
kindness of my heart that make me feel 

2339
01:42:27,210 --> 01:42:27,210
well.
So I walked from 38th street,

2340
01:42:27,210 --> 01:42:30,670
the 46,
grabbed this bitch and walked back to my

2341
01:42:30,671 --> 01:42:33,010
house on 38th street.
I'm all fucking hole and up.

2342
01:42:33,011 --> 01:42:38,011
We start to take a fan.
So I pop up panties off and the Kotex 

2343
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:40,000
Pussy,
it's like a tongue.

2344
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:42,250
One of those fucking haunted houses,
right.

2345
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:48,660
This and I just sat there frozen like I 
had never seen that before.

2346
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:58,360
I had never smelled that before.
I had never been around anything like 

2347
01:42:58,360 --> 01:42:58,360
that.
My mother had just died.

2348
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:02,891
That was traumatic enough.
This was just over the fucking woman 

2349
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:05,180
still alive today.
Till this day,

2350
01:43:05,181 --> 01:43:10,181
I don't even look on facebook because I 
might kill her because she fucked me up.

2351
01:43:11,331 --> 01:43:14,450
Joe Rogan fucked me up.
I told her to put her pants on.

2352
01:43:14,451 --> 01:43:18,620
I remember walking home the whole time.
I wanted to know how to control myself.

2353
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:25,580
Till this day I think about that 
motherfucker because she thought,

2354
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:26,930
I don't know.
That's the first time.

2355
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:30,500
Haven't seen a woman with her period.
And the last I made a fucking point.

2356
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:32,970
That's so funny.
If I'm.

2357
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:35,000
I don't care how old I am,
if I'm in a bar,

2358
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:40,270
I got a bag of coke and somewhere along 
the light that chick says she got her 

2359
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:43,991
period.
That's where the conversation and it 

2360
01:43:43,991 --> 01:43:43,991
ends.
There's no more talking.

2361
01:43:43,991 --> 01:43:45,860
They used to have this freak.
They used to be this chick.

2362
01:43:45,861 --> 01:43:48,920
I used to mess around with Hollywood and
I knew her cycle.

2363
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:52,370
She would have her periods,
the 20th to the 25th.

2364
01:43:52,371 --> 01:43:57,371
I wouldn't answer her calls.
Those five nights dog like six or seven 

2365
01:43:57,371 --> 01:43:59,290
nights just to make sure everything 
cleared and she never figured out.

2366
01:43:59,291 --> 01:44:01,390
To this day,
she's never have.

2367
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:06,460
I wouldn't bring.
I'm going to waste cocoa pussy.

2368
01:44:07,930 --> 01:44:09,690
Fuck it.
I'll by myself and Jack,

2369
01:44:09,770 --> 01:44:11,000
but it doesn't.
It's still feel good.

2370
01:44:11,150 --> 01:44:12,380
It just.
The way it looks.

2371
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:14,720
You don't like the way it looks.
I like it.

2372
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:19,700
There's blood.
Is that bad enough for you?

2373
01:44:19,701 --> 01:44:24,701
That's fucking blood.
It's not bad enough for you right there 

2374
01:44:24,701 --> 01:44:25,430
that you'll fucking blood.
No matter what you're doing.

2375
01:44:25,431 --> 01:44:27,140
You're fucking blood.
I know you like it.

2376
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:30,660
I know Redmond for this tiny little 
gravy comes out.

2377
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:32,580
I.
No,

2378
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:37,790
you send them a bitch.
That's the problem is you don't want to 

2379
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:41,321
look the bloods on the Tampon because 
that's blood that was came out a month 

2380
01:44:41,321 --> 01:44:41,480
ago or whatever.
It is.

2381
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:46,540
Not a our or whatever it is.
It's all dried up and coagulated 93.

2382
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,410
Yes.
Remember in Boston.

2383
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:50,320
That was.
I never did that get know.

2384
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:53,240
That happened after I left,
so it was a Thursday,

2385
01:44:53,241 --> 01:44:54,170
Friday,
Saturday,

2386
01:44:54,171 --> 01:44:55,430
Sunday.
Open mic.

2387
01:44:55,730 --> 01:45:00,730
She did the weekend.
Thursday was headline when he did the 

2388
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:04,490
weekend and then you stayed the week and
during the week I would do Monday,

2389
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:08,060
faneuil hall,
Tuesday some room and fucking quincy,

2390
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:11,960
Thursday wooster and then I go back to 
the ACO ACO or whatever,

2391
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:15,650
but the point of the story is one Sunday
at that place I met.

2392
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:18,380
I had met her before the open mic girl 
was in the navy,

2393
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:23,510
the hotels at club 56 is right next door
and she's like,

2394
01:45:23,511 --> 01:45:26,390
I'm Kinda tipsy and I kind of liked and 
she had a crush on me.

2395
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,130
We started swapping sprint.
We went next door.

2396
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:31,030
That was the first time I was involved 
in one of those dark light swapping,

2397
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,770
spit things.
Hit somebody in the dark.

2398
01:45:33,771 --> 01:45:36,810
We were all over the place on the bag 
and I remember my pants came off,

2399
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:38,780
her shirt came off and I'm giving this 
chicken stabbing,

2400
01:45:39,230 --> 01:45:44,230
but this chick's pussy was fucking wet 
as fuck and I'm banging this like a 

2401
01:45:44,230 --> 01:45:44,530
soldier in these days.
I had stamina.

2402
01:45:44,531 --> 01:45:49,531
It's like 98.
I was a savage before I got before the 

2403
01:45:49,531 --> 01:45:52,150
belt and Doug,
I turned the light on and it was blood 

2404
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:52,150
everywhere.
Yeah.

2405
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:52,700
See if felt good.
Right.

2406
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,530
It didn't feel fucking good at all.

2407
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:58,820
I knew something wasn't right.
I fucked up in the salty.

2408
01:45:58,970 --> 01:46:00,760
Something that's smoked,
something in the fuck.

2409
01:46:00,770 --> 01:46:03,890
That's probably you motherfucker.
I'm on fire.

2410
01:46:03,891 --> 01:46:04,080
No,
no,

2411
01:46:04,090 --> 01:46:04,470
no,
no,

2412
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:06,330
no.
I'm a water.

2413
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:06,790
Do it.
You know,

2414
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:11,800
I like water.
When I go home now I'll take a fucking 

2415
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:12,020
shower before I go do comedy.
I'll take a shower,

2416
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:15,410
I take a shower before I go to the gym.
That's how fucking clean I am.

2417
01:46:15,470 --> 01:46:17,780
I've always felt bad when checks can 
feel bad about it.

2418
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:19,900
No,
I would never call somebody a blade.

2419
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:21,800
Doesn't matter.
I don't even get involved.

2420
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:24,800
It bothers the fuck.
I just read whatever.

2421
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:26,140
Oh No,
no,

2422
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:27,940
it's not.
No one's getting hurt and she's fine.

2423
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:33,290
A lot of times there are extra horny to 
five times girls on their periods or if 

2424
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:35,730
you don't mind,
it doesn't bother me.

2425
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:36,960
I don't care.
It doesn't matter.

2426
01:46:37,070 --> 01:46:38,280
What am I saying?
Shit.

2427
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,450
I think it feels better.
And you change the sheets right after we

2428
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:45,860
shut down a towel.
You Shit to worry about in this life.

2429
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,580
I don't think that's one of them ever.
Period.

2430
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:50,520
We.
You make Chicsville bad man.

2431
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:52,550
No,
I'm not trying to make nobody feel bad.

2432
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:55,340
Listen,
some people don't like snakes.

2433
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:56,730
Snakes.
I'm like,

2434
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:00,170
how are you equating snakes to have 
girls?

2435
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,400
Period?
Because I'm saying fucking same thing.

2436
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:05,740
Fucking consume your soul.
So it's right there.

2437
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:09,020
I spell it out for you.
Listen to your pussy.

2438
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:10,450
Snake,
Adam and eve.

2439
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:13,290
Not everybody likes the same things in 
life.

2440
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:14,790
You know,
people know if you don't,

2441
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:17,070
if you can't handle it and your wife,
people don't like.

2442
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:18,360
Oh yeah,
no doubt.

2443
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:20,930
I just don't like that.
Some just don't like fat guy.

2444
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:23,540
So when I bought some checks to,
you know,

2445
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:28,760
some people don't like,
I just never liked it with a member of 

2446
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:29,490
the time you realized it was probably 
like in your early twenties or whatever,

2447
01:47:29,491 --> 01:47:34,491
that some girls not only would light,
they want you to come in their mouth and

2448
01:47:35,670 --> 01:47:37,770
other girls get mad if you come in their
mouth.

2449
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:39,540
Like,
like this is a,

2450
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:41,190
there's a,
there's a different thing.

2451
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:43,340
There's a very different response here.
Yeah.

2452
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:48,640
You know,
like some girls will say don't come in 

2453
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:48,640
my mouth and you're like,
oh,

2454
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:49,380
okay.
And then other girls in my mouth like,

2455
01:47:49,381 --> 01:47:50,160
Whoa,
for real.

2456
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:52,020
Like is she,
does she really want that?

2457
01:47:52,210 --> 01:47:53,670
She tried to trick me like what is it?

2458
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:55,750
I think the girl that after you fuck 
her,

2459
01:47:55,751 --> 01:47:58,000
she always wants to take a little taste 
of it.

2460
01:47:58,030 --> 01:47:59,410
Like almost like every single day.

2461
01:47:59,830 --> 01:48:01,540
That's a dirty bitch that once a year on
Pussy.

2462
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:05,090
But she's too lazy to work out stretch.
She's too lazy,

2463
01:48:05,210 --> 01:48:07,600
lazy to become one of those.
What are those contortionists?

2464
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:09,840
That's what that is.
She just likes the taste.

2465
01:48:09,890 --> 01:48:14,890
The worst is when you're eating out a 
girl and she is on her period and he 

2466
01:48:14,890 --> 01:48:18,530
don't realize it until the next day and 
you see like the dried blood all over 

2467
01:48:18,530 --> 01:48:19,350
your face and you go to a store and it's
like a clot in her too.

2468
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:21,050
I think that's the alcohol and drug 
problem.

2469
01:48:21,051 --> 01:48:24,050
Really just how the fuck you not knowing
what's going on.

2470
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:26,900
You're eating.
This girl tastes like a bag of pennies.

2471
01:48:26,980 --> 01:48:31,980
Like fuck is going on here.
It was really,

2472
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:37,860
really hot looking like I like all that 
shit over blood.

2473
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:53,420
Blood from fucking vampires.
How many fucking.

2474
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:53,420
And

2475
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:56,030
by the way,
the original vampire think about it.

2476
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:58,600
If you really think about blade set this
motherfucking old.

2477
01:48:58,750 --> 01:48:59,900
He's out.
He's out.

2478
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:02,430
Hopefully it'll make blades nine.
Yeah.

2479
01:49:02,490 --> 01:49:07,490
And for anybody who thinks I have a 
problem with that guy and I never had a 

2480
01:49:07,490 --> 01:49:07,560
problem with that guy.
There was supposedly an MMA fight.

2481
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:08,850
They were trying.
It sounds like bullshit.

2482
01:49:08,851 --> 01:49:10,380
And other talk about sleep pipes.
Yeah.

2483
01:49:10,381 --> 01:49:12,960
With Wesley Snipes it was not my idea 
and I didn't.

2484
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:14,070
I didn't,
you know,

2485
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:16,050
I didn't have any animosity towards her 
car at all.

2486
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:18,000
How much time do you did?
Three years.

2487
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:21,240
Three.
You have three fucking years,

2488
01:49:21,241 --> 01:49:26,241
man.
I just for the fucking wheel and not 

2489
01:49:26,241 --> 01:49:26,241
only that,
he was willing to pay.

2490
01:49:26,241 --> 01:49:27,070
They were like,
Ooh,

2491
01:49:27,170 --> 01:49:28,190
doesn't matter.
You go in,

2492
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:31,520
you're going to jail.
Like he admitted that he made a mistake,

2493
01:49:31,650 --> 01:49:33,060
tried to pay them off,
and they're like,

2494
01:49:33,061 --> 01:49:33,870
no,
you have to do time.

2495
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:36,180
You have to do time.
They put him in jail for three years.

2496
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:39,390
You can't just the government,
whether you,

2497
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,280
especially if you're in a position of 
prominence,

2498
01:49:41,281 --> 01:49:44,980
like a giant movie star like that.
If you run around saying that you're not

2499
01:49:44,981 --> 01:49:49,981
going to pay taxes that can fuck up 
everything and they have to make an 

2500
01:49:49,981 --> 01:49:50,470
example of you.
It's almost like they have to,

2501
01:49:50,930 --> 01:49:55,930
you know,
because there's a lot of people out 

2502
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:57,181
there that will argue about the 
constitutional legality of this and 

2503
01:49:57,181 --> 01:50:01,021
that.
And the reality is everybody's paying 

2504
01:50:01,021 --> 01:50:01,260
you gotta pay you.
No,

2505
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,340
it doesn't.
No one wrote it down in 17.

2506
01:50:03,341 --> 01:50:04,120
Seventy six.
Okay,

2507
01:50:04,121 --> 01:50:09,121
but it's 2013.
The reality of this situation is that 

2508
01:50:09,121 --> 01:50:09,160
everybody's paying and these people that
go,

2509
01:50:09,161 --> 01:50:14,161
you know,
we have found a clause here deep within 

2510
01:50:14,161 --> 01:50:16,891
the constitution that clearly states 
that what is going on is 

2511
01:50:16,891 --> 01:50:16,891
unconstitutional,
unlawful,

2512
01:50:16,891 --> 01:50:19,420
and they would never have this brought 
up in a court of law because if this was

2513
01:50:19,421 --> 01:50:24,421
exposed,
it would take down the very empire 

2514
01:50:24,421 --> 01:50:24,421
itself.

2515
01:50:24,421 --> 01:50:24,421
And people go,
fuck,

2516
01:50:24,421 --> 01:50:25,570
I ain't paying taxes.
Let him come get me.

2517
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:26,920
I'll start talking.
Shit.

2518
01:50:27,070 --> 01:50:32,070
I start telling them about how the tax 
code is illegal and not even in the 

2519
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:32,860
constitution,
you know,

2520
01:50:32,861 --> 01:50:36,220
and they're like telling Leslie Leslie,
and next thing you know,

2521
01:50:36,221 --> 01:50:37,870
I don't know.
I don't know if it went down that way.

2522
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:40,720
I'm just guessing I'm making shit up.
I don't mean to be me,

2523
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:42,970
me of the guy.
But then next thing you know,

2524
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:47,350
he bought into some guy's idea and 
didn't pay taxes like willfully.

2525
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:50,310
And so that was for like a couple of 
years and when,

2526
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:52,690
when they were going after him and like 
they're trying to,

2527
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:53,730
you know,
he,

2528
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:54,960
he,
he won,

2529
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,340
won but didn't win.
He didn't lose.

2530
01:50:57,730 --> 01:51:00,940
He lost like the second most important 
one,

2531
01:51:00,941 --> 01:51:03,400
but I think he was acquitted in the most
important one,

2532
01:51:03,401 --> 01:51:06,430
which was like a conspiracy or something
along those lines,

2533
01:51:06,670 --> 01:51:11,670
but he's still willfully avoided paying 
taxes and so they put them away for 

2534
01:51:11,670 --> 01:51:11,710
three solid years.

2535
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:13,960
You know,
when you're 47 years old like he was,

2536
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:19,290
that's,
that's a long chunk of the future of 

2537
01:51:19,290 --> 01:51:19,290
your life,
you know?

2538
01:51:19,290 --> 01:51:19,510
How much more time do you have?
Do you have?

2539
01:51:20,290 --> 01:51:22,460
Who's the oldest person ever?
He's like 1:20

2540
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,460
and so we got eight years left,
less,

2541
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:26,350
less than 80 years and someone just 
stole three.

2542
01:51:26,650 --> 01:51:30,730
They stole three and wanting to put you 
in a cage because you didn't pay them.

2543
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:34,240
That is like some of the most gangster 
shit,

2544
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:37,360
like any society can never pull on its 
citizens.

2545
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:40,240
If you don't give us a piece of what you
earn,

2546
01:51:40,930 --> 01:51:43,690
then we're going to put you in a cage.
It's not like a debt.

2547
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:48,720
It's not like there's some money on the 
ledger that has to be corrected and you 

2548
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:50,200
have to eventually re compensate us 
until we're even.

2549
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:51,460
No,
no.

2550
01:51:51,461 --> 01:51:53,350
We're going to lock you in a cage.

2551
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:55,690
That's our solution when you get up.
Yeah,

2552
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,310
you're still going to have to pay us.
Well,

2553
01:51:57,311 --> 01:52:02,311
that's a fairly,
and that's a fairly victimless crime if 

2554
01:52:02,311 --> 01:52:04,771
you really think about it and the 
greater spectrum of all the things that 

2555
01:52:04,771 --> 01:52:05,350
goes wrong in this country.
That's a fairly victimless crime.

2556
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:07,720
I mean,
absolutely it's a crime.

2557
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:12,721
Absolutely.
People should have to contribute to the 

2558
01:52:12,721 --> 01:52:13,120
fixing of the highways and paying police
officers and all that jazz,

2559
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:18,780
but the idea that someone should be just
locked in a cage for that is kind of 

2560
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:19,990
crazy.
I mean,

2561
01:52:19,991 --> 01:52:22,660
there's people that don't get locked in 
a cage for assault.

2562
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:27,810
There's people that don't get locked in 
a cage for much more horrible physical 

2563
01:52:27,810 --> 01:52:28,990
things where there's actual real trauma 
to an individual.

2564
01:52:28,991 --> 01:52:32,170
There's an actual victim and they don't 
get locked in a cage for three years.

2565
01:52:32,171 --> 01:52:37,171
You said the reasons why?
Because they wanted to make an example 

2566
01:52:37,171 --> 01:52:38,010
out of him as a person in his position.
You know,

2567
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:43,020
you can't go to the government going and
paint that really can send tags down 

2568
01:52:43,020 --> 01:52:43,360
there.
Fuck you.

2569
01:52:43,510 --> 01:52:46,040
Dave Koresh.
If you haven't learned when they want

2570
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,090
their shit,
they get there,

2571
01:52:47,210 --> 01:52:50,990
fuck it don't matter the government or 
your fucking constitution,

2572
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:56,170
throw that shit out the fucking window 
and I pity you for even believing that 

2573
01:52:56,170 --> 01:52:56,650
if you fuck up baton up,
they're coming to get you.

2574
01:52:56,670 --> 01:53:01,670
My friend at this point like retracting 
that is going to be met with furious 

2575
01:53:02,481 --> 01:53:05,360
resistance and the idea that it's not as
as really silly.

2576
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:10,700
It's almost like at a point in this 
country where things are so weird that 

2577
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:12,890
it's almost like one of two things has 
to happen.

2578
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:16,790
Either there's some sort of 
technological breakthrough that makes it

2579
01:53:16,791 --> 01:53:19,160
impossible align anymore and then from 
now on,

2580
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:21,170
everybody has to operate like 100 
percent.

2581
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:26,590
No bullshit.
It's either that when we get adapted to 

2582
01:53:26,590 --> 01:53:29,120
that or some fucking walking dead Zombie
type situation where we have to reinvent

2583
01:53:29,121 --> 01:53:32,660
civilization because we just keep going.
The way we're going right now.

2584
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:37,870
This is.
There's so many opportunities for us to 

2585
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:39,680
trip over our own decks.
Just this North Korea thing alone.

2586
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:46,080
See what's going on with this crazy 
motherfuckers just pointing rockets at 

2587
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,180
everybody and Saber rattling and saying,
what do they need?

2588
01:53:47,210 --> 01:53:48,590
They need food.
Do they need.

2589
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:50,090
They need power,
electricity.

2590
01:53:50,091 --> 01:53:55,091
They need something.
Obviously this guy's doing something to 

2591
01:53:55,091 --> 01:53:56,300
get some sort of attention and get some,
some people to calm him down.

2592
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:58,850
How long can that guy be around for?
How long can you have?

2593
01:53:58,851 --> 01:54:01,940
India and Pakistan hate each other,
pointing nuclear arms at each other.

2594
01:54:01,941 --> 01:54:02,420
Right?
Right.

2595
01:54:02,421 --> 01:54:05,180
They're just like staring at each other,
you know?

2596
01:54:05,181 --> 01:54:06,890
How much longer can people do what 
they're doing?

2597
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:13,060
It's kind of weird.
It's like one of two things has to 

2598
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:13,060
happen.
Either we,

2599
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:15,900
they've got to figure out some new 
invention that lets people all realize 

2600
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:19,700
that we all have like there's 
repercussions to everyone's actions,

2601
01:54:19,701 --> 01:54:24,701
positive and negative and everybody has 
a stake and everything that happens all 

2602
01:54:24,701 --> 01:54:28,571
over the world,
whether it's in the Congo or the 

2603
01:54:28,571 --> 01:54:28,571
fucking.

2604
01:54:28,571 --> 01:54:29,210
The people that are getting run out of 
the Brazilian rainforest because loggers

2605
01:54:29,211 --> 01:54:31,490
have moved in.
Those guys are douchebags like,

2606
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:32,930
let's.
Let's be clear about that.

2607
01:54:33,110 --> 01:54:36,050
Like some people were living in tents.
Some guys want to steal their trees like

2608
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:39,530
everybody needs to settle the fuck down.
We need to look at this globally and the

2609
01:54:39,531 --> 01:54:44,531
fact that like country shit can happen 
in the Amazon and the Congo and all 

2610
01:54:44,531 --> 01:54:47,891
these different spots while that happens
and we know about it will never be at 

2611
01:54:47,891 --> 01:54:52,751
balance and it seems to me it's like 
something has to happen that connects 

2612
01:54:52,751 --> 01:54:55,250
everybody.
Whether it's a stage of evolution,

2613
01:54:55,251 --> 01:55:00,251
whether it's a slow progress of things 
it's we're going through right now that 

2614
01:55:00,251 --> 01:55:04,271
we're where people are getting upset at 
things right now that they never got 

2615
01:55:04,271 --> 01:55:04,271
upset before.
You know,

2616
01:55:04,271 --> 01:55:08,060
where people are sort of realizing that 
there were much more connected than than

2617
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:09,380
people have ever been before.

2618
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:14,800
And if that doesn't like continue on 
that trend when you've got things like 

2619
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,700
North Korea,
when you got things like what's going on

2620
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:20,660
in the Congo and you've got really bad 
spots in Afghanistan.

2621
01:55:20,661 --> 01:55:23,450
Really bad spots on Iraq and the world 
is.

2622
01:55:23,490 --> 01:55:28,490
There's,
there's parts of the world right now 

2623
01:55:28,490 --> 01:55:28,490
that are in the apocalypse.
They're right there.

2624
01:55:28,490 --> 01:55:32,320
The apocalypse exists and it's going on 
right now and while we're all just 

2625
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:37,301
sitting here living our lives that's 
taken place and we know it and because 

2626
01:55:37,301 --> 01:55:38,420
we know it,
we always feel out of whack.

2627
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:44,650
We always feel like if,
if the whole world got his shit 

2628
01:55:44,650 --> 01:55:44,650
together,
if we

2629
01:55:44,650 --> 01:55:49,050
human beings figured out a way where no 
one was fucking over anybody anywhere in

2630
01:55:49,051 --> 01:55:50,460
the world,
no one was murdered.

2631
01:55:50,461 --> 01:55:52,410
Anybody anywhere in the world,
no one was raped.

2632
01:55:52,411 --> 01:55:56,160
Anybody anywhere in the world that could
be possible.

2633
01:55:56,190 --> 01:56:01,190
If it's possible doing this room,
it's possible doing the whole country 

2634
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:01,190
too late.
I already raped the chairman.

2635
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:05,040
Does that make sense or am I just too 
stoned?

2636
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:12,020
Go back to.
I know that we have had discussions 

2637
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:15,411
about your fears and you always said 
that one of your biggest fears was 

2638
01:56:15,411 --> 01:56:17,220
staying healthy when you got older.
You didn't want to really,

2639
01:56:17,221 --> 01:56:18,300
really get old,
you know,

2640
01:56:18,301 --> 01:56:19,830
and well,
I don't want my body to feel,

2641
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:24,840
feel walking around with a failing body.
LemMe tell you something that petrifies 

2642
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:24,840
me more than anything.
You know,

2643
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:29,670
nothing scares me.
I never wanted to go to jail after 45 

2644
01:56:29,670 --> 01:56:29,790
through.
Yeah,

2645
01:56:30,510 --> 01:56:34,550
I know all these gangsters and Glorious 
and they fucking glorifying them.

2646
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:35,590
Biography.
You know what?

2647
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:40,910
They died in the fucking hole.
I Know Gloria and Dynamo fucking hole 

2648
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:43,040
when you're 55 and above.
I tell you what,

2649
01:56:43,041 --> 01:56:48,041
and I knew this when I was 20 at the 55.
There's only one thing you should be 

2650
01:56:48,041 --> 01:56:52,011
worried about your grandchildren and 
your pension to be paid for and that 

2651
01:56:52,770 --> 01:56:57,770
it's amazing that those creeps made it 
that long and then when you see guys 

2652
01:56:57,770 --> 01:56:58,890
like John Gotti and jail,
Sam in the bowl,

2653
01:56:58,891 --> 01:56:59,580
they let him out.

2654
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:02,160
That doesn't show you how to jail.
Yeah,

2655
01:57:02,161 --> 01:57:07,161
but I mean they let him out.
Let him out when he was involved and 

2656
01:57:07,161 --> 01:57:10,100
they knew he was involved in at least 
like how many murders pointed but some 

2657
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:13,791
insane amount of murders and they let 
him go because he gave them information 

2658
01:57:13,791 --> 01:57:13,791
on God.
But the beauty is that 20,

2659
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,920
30 years from now,
somebody's going to find the file on 

2660
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:20,190
Sammy the bull gravano and it's going.
It'd be one of the biggest smacks to the

2661
01:57:20,191 --> 01:57:24,390
American people that you've ever known.
Nobody really knew what really happened.

2662
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:29,630
Nobody knew that the government wanted 
it so bad they wanted him.

2663
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:32,040
I don't give up.
Listen,

2664
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:35,990
I don't give a fuck.
I want this guy that will do,

2665
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:38,580
will he killed 80 people.
Fucking there were Italian.

2666
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,530
They got what they deserved.
Fuck them and their mother.

2667
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,420
That's the thinking,
you know,

2668
01:57:42,421 --> 01:57:44,970
and,
and what people don't know is that Sammy

2669
01:57:44,971 --> 01:57:45,750
was brilliant.

2670
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:50,760
The sense that he was the first one.
That was the first one to wrap what he 

2671
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:51,960
did to the government was brilliant.
The government knew.

2672
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:57,140
I told you that there's the stories that
the government was collecting his loan 

2673
01:57:57,140 --> 01:57:57,390
shark payments.
When he went away,

2674
01:57:57,870 --> 01:57:59,490
he went into the system,
got out,

2675
01:57:59,790 --> 01:58:04,790
and then that's when it really blew up 
in their face because all these people 

2676
01:58:04,790 --> 01:58:05,490
started going and testifying saying,
I would never lie.

2677
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:06,460
I sold drugs.
Uh,

2678
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:08,070
Sammy,
the bull of government go,

2679
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:09,180
no,
you didn't.

2680
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:14,450
Sammy never sold a drug in his life.
But after 50 people came in and said 

2681
01:58:14,450 --> 01:58:14,910
yes,
they did.

2682
01:58:14,911 --> 01:58:16,340
The government finally said,
hey,

2683
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:18,830
fucking lie,
and then that fucking idiot went on,

2684
01:58:18,831 --> 01:58:22,580
things will be out on the ice.
Man went on Hbo.

2685
01:58:22,581 --> 01:58:27,120
Now this third last interview,
he said he killed the cop and then Sammy

2686
01:58:27,121 --> 01:58:29,250
the bull gravano gave him the yard.

2687
01:58:30,330 --> 01:58:33,510
They went to the files.
They said they seen that he never copped

2688
01:58:33,511 --> 01:58:38,511
to that cop and lost them.
They had to move out with ecstasy ring 

2689
01:58:38,511 --> 01:58:41,641
and they pulled him into jail and the 
ice band mysteriously died to tell his 

2690
01:58:42,191 --> 01:58:47,191
story to prosecute Sammy.
They took the ball and they put them in 

2691
01:58:47,191 --> 01:58:49,150
Colorado in Tomahawk,
under the fucking prison,

2692
01:58:51,010 --> 01:58:53,590
under the prison.
So the government,

2693
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:56,170
this is a king.
He never sees the light,

2694
01:58:56,200 --> 01:59:01,200
never sees light again,
but the government didn't give a fuck 

2695
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:02,050
when they cut the deal,
and that's not just with him.

2696
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:04,780
They do this all the time,
but it's a different government.

2697
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:09,930
That's the thing.
It's like the people that are in charge 

2698
01:59:09,930 --> 01:59:12,031
today and not the people that put Sammy 
the bull out on the street back during 

2699
01:59:12,031 --> 01:59:13,360
the daytime,
most likely five fucking years.

2700
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:16,570
He got for killing 20 people and they 
got to take his money.

2701
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:18,730
Yeah,
you got to take $10,000,000

2702
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:20,950
and he got to.
They didn't care.

2703
01:59:20,951 --> 01:59:22,630
And then they put him in if he was in 
Phoenix.

2704
01:59:22,631 --> 01:59:27,631
Right.
And then he didn't even try to go under 

2705
01:59:27,631 --> 01:59:30,061
a fake name or something like that.
He told him to go fuck himself or he 

2706
01:59:30,061 --> 01:59:31,000
told him to come and get them.
That's how crazy.

2707
01:59:31,001 --> 01:59:36,001
That little mother,
five foot five training with Teddy 

2708
01:59:36,001 --> 01:59:36,001
Atlas.
Five days a week.

2709
01:59:36,001 --> 01:59:38,140
She is the ball default.
Fuck.

2710
01:59:38,141 --> 01:59:39,430
Did you see him before?
Huge.

2711
01:59:39,470 --> 01:59:41,650
Did you see him when he got nailed?
He looks scary.

2712
01:59:41,651 --> 01:59:44,140
He was five,
five to something.

2713
01:59:44,190 --> 01:59:46,270
Who's a human bulldog?
He was,

2714
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:51,320
you know.
And he was fighting every morning over 

2715
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:53,761
that with Daddy Alice.
That's the truth to the outlets was his 

2716
01:59:53,761 --> 01:59:53,761
training.
Wow.

2717
01:59:53,761 --> 01:59:54,830
Yeah.
That was a scary time when you have like

2718
01:59:54,850 --> 01:59:58,480
real legit mafia criminals like 
flaunting it and New York.

2719
01:59:58,570 --> 02:00:00,110
What about what's going on?

2720
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:02,320
I ain't your shit about how they just,
you know,

2721
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:03,550
I shouldn't say this,
how they,

2722
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:08,850
they arrest the Arabs in New York and 
try to flip the things on them and try 

2723
02:00:08,850 --> 02:00:09,580
to get those terrorists case.
What are they doing?

2724
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:14,640
I don't know.
We had a discussion about they take the 

2725
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:17,730
people that go and push,
they'd take Arabs and they go and push 

2726
02:00:17,730 --> 02:00:20,731
them in on those terror groups.
Well they did that and then I gave the 

2727
02:00:20,731 --> 02:00:21,910
guy,
I think it was Dallas,

2728
02:00:21,911 --> 02:00:24,640
they gave a guy a fake bomb and they uh,
they had um,

2729
02:00:24,641 --> 02:00:26,080
tried to detonate it when you tried to 
detonate,

2730
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:27,660
they're arrested for trying to detonate 
a bomb.

2731
02:00:28,130 --> 02:00:29,800
Like,
like you gave them the bomb,

2732
02:00:30,010 --> 02:00:30,910
like,
you know,

2733
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:34,900
and I mean that's so crazy.
The idea that they would be able to make

2734
02:00:34,901 --> 02:00:36,280
a fake bomb.
Get it to you.

2735
02:00:36,610 --> 02:00:37,400
Let's do this.

2736
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,090
Let's do the compensation.
Okay sir,

2737
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:43,360
my friend bumper,
you know I'm going to give it to you.

2738
02:00:43,361 --> 02:00:44,470
You're the bomb guy.
Well,

2739
02:00:44,471 --> 02:00:47,410
I think he thought he was dealing with a
terrorist organization.

2740
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:49,620
He gets to know he was dealing with the 
FBI.

2741
02:00:50,110 --> 02:00:51,940
He had some FBI guy,
who is his.

2742
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:52,680
This,
my friend,

2743
02:00:52,690 --> 02:00:53,650
uh,
medicat is devil.

2744
02:00:53,690 --> 02:00:55,810
We're going to take it down.
You are in,

2745
02:00:55,811 --> 02:00:57,670
you are an important part of our 
program.

2746
02:00:57,900 --> 02:00:58,870
This guy's an idiot.
He's like,

2747
02:00:58,871 --> 02:01:01,090
I'm an important part.
Finally something.

2748
02:01:01,091 --> 02:01:02,470
Anything.
What do I do?

2749
02:01:02,530 --> 02:01:07,530
Is that an offensive voice?
Offensive or stereotypical Arab type 

2750
02:01:07,530 --> 02:01:09,340
dude voice?
What do I do?

2751
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:12,310
I don't know.
So what do you think?

2752
02:01:12,311 --> 02:01:13,420
Uh,
how do you think it went down?

2753
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:15,400
Said to him.
That's a good angle.

2754
02:01:15,401 --> 02:01:20,401
What do you think?
You said you take this and you put it 

2755
02:01:20,401 --> 02:01:20,401
in.
When you come back,

2756
02:01:20,401 --> 02:01:21,550
we'll give you a badge and they probably
be like Mpi,

2757
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:24,300
benching and everything.
The guys like you.

2758
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:29,780
It shouldn't be $55,000
a year to start benching and God and 

2759
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:31,120
God,
that's only,

2760
02:01:31,170 --> 02:01:34,330
that's only going to be back.
That's so he planned ahead.

2761
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:39,360
He was that type of person.
All the governments always two steps 

2762
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:39,440
ahead of you though.
I think the guy was probably like,

2763
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:40,130
if I do

2764
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:41,330
this,
you'll be my friend.

2765
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:46,330
What are you plan a terrorist music.
That's music.

2766
02:01:48,110 --> 02:01:48,840
If it's,
you know,

2767
02:01:48,841 --> 02:01:53,841
a terrorist music.
Is that John Ashcroft song that's 

2768
02:01:53,841 --> 02:01:54,140
fucking terrorist music?
No one's terrorism,

2769
02:01:54,141 --> 02:01:55,610
bro.
Subway Sandwich.

2770
02:01:57,320 --> 02:01:59,540
How is that?
Tara was thinking I was in Nashville,

2771
02:01:59,541 --> 02:02:01,100
you know,
across the street from Nashville.

2772
02:02:01,270 --> 02:02:03,050
It's a subway sandwich right there,
right.

2773
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:07,840
I'll fucking coolest Nashville.
Xannies national am I fucking around and

2774
02:02:08,170 --> 02:02:09,620
it's nice people.
Cool.

2775
02:02:09,650 --> 02:02:13,090
Nashville's a attached was as a fucking 
cool tap.

2776
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:18,220
Yeah.
But I was looking at that stuff and I'm 

2777
02:02:18,220 --> 02:02:18,220
like those motherfuckers.
So Turkey fucking Salami.

2778
02:02:18,220 --> 02:02:19,850
Turkey Salami,
right.

2779
02:02:20,140 --> 02:02:21,560
You know,
they do such bad shit.

2780
02:02:21,580 --> 02:02:24,190
I don't even give you a full foot.
Yeah.

2781
02:02:24,191 --> 02:02:24,790
Did you hear it?
See,

2782
02:02:24,850 --> 02:02:29,850
it looks like I knew it was fucking me.
When you get six inches,

2783
02:02:29,931 --> 02:02:34,931
that's when you know a ton of sense 
because I worked on lumberyard for 

2784
02:02:34,931 --> 02:02:34,931
fucking years.

2785
02:02:34,931 --> 02:02:37,430
Six inches more like what?
Second?

2786
02:02:37,431 --> 02:02:39,410
In short,
the whole foot longs.

2787
02:02:39,411 --> 02:02:44,411
I got it.
I fucking talk to sit at one time and 

2788
02:02:44,411 --> 02:02:45,350
then they got mad.
They got food poisoning from the tuna.

2789
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:49,160
The tune is bad and I got at one time.
I liked the tuna for years,

2790
02:02:49,161 --> 02:02:51,380
but I.
You can't say that I'm podcast,

2791
02:02:51,381 --> 02:02:52,100
we're gonna.
Get in trouble.

2792
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:53,730
No,
I'm just telling me,

2793
02:02:53,970 --> 02:02:58,970
allegedly saying that someone should 
sell the post office to a private 

2794
02:02:58,970 --> 02:03:02,951
contractor to run it like dps and 
thought what the fuck and this guy 

2795
02:03:02,951 --> 02:03:05,360
written up.
The comedy store is what happens when we

2796
02:03:05,361 --> 02:03:08,600
take a few days up the health department
on that way right now.

2797
02:03:08,601 --> 02:03:10,500
I'm not going to store.
Yeah,

2798
02:03:10,570 --> 02:03:12,700
you got a problem.
He's in there with a fucking.

2799
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:15,410
I want you to take a bus.
Patient Shit.

2800
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:20,510
They arrest him as a girl enters into 
that bathroom.

2801
02:03:22,690 --> 02:03:25,370
Security is hovering over the window 
looking in.

2802
02:03:28,370 --> 02:03:32,800
You're such a fucking man.
You just fucked everybody who has a part

2803
02:03:32,801 --> 02:03:33,920
of that place.
Brian,

2804
02:03:33,990 --> 02:03:38,990
you really did.
You're a terrible mother fuckers for 

2805
02:03:38,990 --> 02:03:38,990
years.
We're looking at something,

2806
02:03:39,470 --> 02:03:41,360
looking at pussy.
I can't even dream.

2807
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:47,090
How can you be such a fucking thing?
You know?

2808
02:03:47,690 --> 02:03:52,690
I judge everybody by my actions.
At least discuss those.

2809
02:03:56,391 --> 02:03:59,180
Look in the fucking pool.
Ladies Pussy do a fucking thing.

2810
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:00,740
And to even looking.
I mean,

2811
02:04:01,580 --> 02:04:04,350
I don't understand.
I really don't.

2812
02:04:05,450 --> 02:04:08,120
That's the thing about any open 
institution,

2813
02:04:08,121 --> 02:04:13,121
whether it's a comedy store or a park 
where kids hang out and you're going to 

2814
02:04:13,121 --> 02:04:15,700
get going to get all kinds of people.
You're going to get real friendly people

2815
02:04:15,701 --> 02:04:17,580
and you get to get people that suck.
You know,

2816
02:04:17,590 --> 02:04:19,970
and at the comedy store,
you've got to have both of that too.

2817
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:25,200
You know,
we've always had those few comedians 

2818
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:25,200
that would come around and you're like,
Jesus Christ,

2819
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:29,171
you got a back up and move away and just
like they have bad mojo and they're all 

2820
02:04:29,171 --> 02:04:29,300
upset that,
you know,

2821
02:04:29,301 --> 02:04:31,400
why am,
why am I on this time?

2822
02:04:31,401 --> 02:04:34,430
And Joey Diaz is on at this time,
this is bullshit.

2823
02:04:34,431 --> 02:04:37,130
And they stomp around.
You always get that right.

2824
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:38,040
Always.

2825
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:41,010
Always put the people put cameras,
have bathrooms other places.

2826
02:04:41,011 --> 02:04:46,011
I see it all the time.
I didn't Chuck Berry get in trouble for 

2827
02:04:46,011 --> 02:04:46,740
doing that or the steak houses.
And so chuck Berry,

2828
02:04:46,741 --> 02:04:48,600
I believe,
got in trouble for doing that.

2829
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:51,150
I should probably look that up,
putting the fucking tape in the backroom

2830
02:04:51,151 --> 02:04:53,290
and then go and what are you doing?
Excuse me,

2831
02:04:53,310 --> 02:04:58,310
go back.
At the end of the day and empty the 

2832
02:04:58,310 --> 02:04:58,310
camera looking at people pissing.
Why are you asking me?

2833
02:04:58,310 --> 02:05:01,971
I don't know.
Because you went into all that shit out 

2834
02:05:01,971 --> 02:05:01,971
because I can't say that.
I don't want to say the.

2835
02:05:01,971 --> 02:05:02,880
How dare you?
Well,

2836
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:05,040
if you take a pee at Brian's house,
he's watched.

2837
02:05:05,070 --> 02:05:06,450
No,
I'm not just saying that.

2838
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:10,140
Motherfuckers watching those iphone,
I gave him the banana bread.

2839
02:05:10,410 --> 02:05:15,410
I caught him with his phone off you 
gotta he was taping somebody at the ice 

2840
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:15,410
house.
This motherfucker,

2841
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:15,750
he got like eight cameras all around 
this.

2842
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:17,430
Oh this is so not true.

2843
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:22,720
But I,
I get that I was talking to a comic that

2844
02:05:22,721 --> 02:05:27,010
we are all friends with a or,
and he's like,

2845
02:05:27,011 --> 02:05:32,011
I want to send you something because I 
was talking about the maps website and 

2846
02:05:32,011 --> 02:05:32,340
uh,
he,

2847
02:05:32,341 --> 02:05:33,790
he goes,
I have something to send you.

2848
02:05:34,090 --> 02:05:39,090
And he gives it and take it.
And it was like a two things have keys 

2849
02:05:39,090 --> 02:05:40,210
like key chains and they're like the 
little,

2850
02:05:40,211 --> 02:05:41,590
uh,
things for your car,

2851
02:05:41,591 --> 02:05:43,210
for the alarm.
And I'm like,

2852
02:05:43,211 --> 02:05:46,450
why is he sending me this car?
And I opened it up and it's a camera and

2853
02:05:46,451 --> 02:05:51,451
what you do is you put it on your key 
chain and so then like when you're 

2854
02:05:51,451 --> 02:05:51,790
somewhere like a massage parlor or 
something like that,

2855
02:05:51,791 --> 02:05:54,970
you hit record and just put down your 
keys and that records hd video.

2856
02:05:56,050 --> 02:05:57,250
He just sent it to me.
He's like,

2857
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:58,210
oh,
trust me,

2858
02:05:58,211 --> 02:05:59,590
I have the greatest thing for you.

2859
02:06:01,010 --> 02:06:01,690
Okay,
I got it.

2860
02:06:01,691 --> 02:06:03,260
I got it.
Totally wrong.

2861
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:07,070
Story of Chuck Berry.
Chuck Barry did a lot of wacky shit,

2862
02:06:07,071 --> 02:06:10,850
but that's not one of them.
One of the things he did in 1959,

2863
02:06:10,851 --> 02:06:15,851
he was arrested out of the Mann Act that
he had sex with a 14 year old waitress 

2864
02:06:15,851 --> 02:06:19,190
from which he transported over state 
lines to work as a hat check girl at his

2865
02:06:19,191 --> 02:06:20,840
club.
Fourteen year old,

2866
02:06:22,190 --> 02:06:25,340
14 year old.
Which race he was convicted,

2867
02:06:25,490 --> 02:06:28,430
fined $5,000
and sentenced to five years in prison.

2868
02:06:28,700 --> 02:06:33,700
His appeal of the judge's comments and 
the attitude were racist and prejudice 

2869
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:36,260
by the jury against them was upheld.
And the second trial was held in May and

2870
02:06:36,350 --> 02:06:41,350
June of 1961,
which resulted in barry being given a 

2871
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:43,430
three year prison sentence after another
appeal failed.

2872
02:06:43,610 --> 02:06:48,610
Barry served one year,
one and a half years in prison from 

2873
02:06:48,610 --> 02:06:50,060
February of 1962 to October of 1963.

2874
02:06:50,690 --> 02:06:53,650
He pleaded guilty to tax evasion,
was sentenced to four months in prison,

2875
02:06:53,660 --> 02:06:58,250
a thousand hours of community service 
doing benefit concerts in 1979.

2876
02:06:58,420 --> 02:07:03,080
And in 1990 he pleaded guilty to 
misdemeanor possession of marijuana law.

2877
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:09,040
The last one that got him for wheat,
they should've looked at as legend 

2878
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:09,040
going.
This guy's done enough time.

2879
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:10,100
She's transferred.
He said,

2880
02:07:10,101 --> 02:07:12,350
listen,
maybe listen to not let me go to suck my

2881
02:07:12,351 --> 02:07:17,351
Dick.
But I got a job as a motherfucker had 

2882
02:07:17,351 --> 02:07:17,351
checked.
14,

2883
02:07:17,351 --> 02:07:19,100
14 year old hat check girl.
Holy Shit.

2884
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,700
Wow.
Chuck Berry was a bad motherfucker,

2885
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:24,770
you know,
that was a totally different time in the

2886
02:07:24,771 --> 02:07:27,070
world too.
But that's the racism that guy felt.

2887
02:07:27,170 --> 02:07:28,460
What about the gun?
I played the piano.

2888
02:07:28,461 --> 02:07:31,400
He fucked his cousin.
And so red band.

2889
02:07:31,430 --> 02:07:32,540
What's that?
What's?

2890
02:07:32,541 --> 02:07:34,090
Come on guys.
Who are you talking about that,

2891
02:07:34,091 --> 02:07:34,370
that,
that,

2892
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,850
that Jerry Lee Lewis?

2893
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,530
Yeah.
He fucked his cousin.

2894
02:07:38,590 --> 02:07:40,420
And he might've,
uh,

2895
02:07:41,430 --> 02:07:44,950
the allegations were that at one point 
in time that he killed his wife.

2896
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:47,570
It wasn't,
it didn't.

2897
02:07:47,571 --> 02:07:48,050
He?
Uh,

2898
02:07:48,110 --> 02:07:49,610
he get in trouble.
That's what they call them.

2899
02:07:49,611 --> 02:07:50,660
The killer.
That was actually,

2900
02:07:50,661 --> 02:07:50,900
isn't it?

2901
02:07:53,470 --> 02:07:56,220
What's so funny?
He's so fucked up on edibles.

2902
02:07:56,330 --> 02:08:01,330
You can tell high right now,
but I didn't smoke pot for over a week.

2903
02:08:01,570 --> 02:08:03,850
You didn't?
I didn't swipe up for the show.

2904
02:08:03,851 --> 02:08:05,170
Now we're,
we're off the deep end.

2905
02:08:05,370 --> 02:08:07,690
Let me tell you something.
So this guy,

2906
02:08:07,691 --> 02:08:09,330
fuck this cuts.
Killed this.

2907
02:08:10,310 --> 02:08:11,490
Yeah.
Someone drown.

2908
02:08:11,491 --> 02:08:13,660
Like one of his wives drowned.
Yeah.

2909
02:08:14,650 --> 02:08:16,090
But you know,
she could have just drowned.

2910
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:16,930
Man,
you know,

2911
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:18,550
might not have been.
What?

2912
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:20,540
Are you doing,
you guys slandering?

2913
02:08:20,590 --> 02:08:21,000
No,
no,

2914
02:08:21,010 --> 02:08:26,010
he was so crazy.
Jerry Lee Lewis was so fucking crazy 

2915
02:08:26,010 --> 02:08:26,010
that him and chuck berry,
we're doing a gig together.

2916
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:28,210
And uh,
Chuck Barry Played Piano too,

2917
02:08:28,211 --> 02:08:29,170
right?
I think so.

2918
02:08:29,230 --> 02:08:29,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

2919
02:08:29,610 --> 02:08:34,610
So was it,
was it was chuck Berry that he lifted 

2920
02:08:34,610 --> 02:08:34,610
his piano on fire?
That liberace?

2921
02:08:34,610 --> 02:08:34,610
No,
no,

2922
02:08:34,610 --> 02:08:34,770
no.
That's a

2923
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:40,370
didn't Jerry Lewis?
It was Jerry Lewis falsified,

2924
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:43,570
but Jerry Lewis lit chuck Berry's piano 
on fire.

2925
02:08:44,010 --> 02:08:45,610
I don't remember that.
I think he did.

2926
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:49,240
I think.
I think he did and I think he said like,

2927
02:08:49,241 --> 02:08:52,000
follow that motherfucker like you lit 
the piano on fire.

2928
02:08:52,090 --> 02:08:57,090
I'm pretty sure I need to pull that up 
because maybe I'm just combining scenes 

2929
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:58,990
in movies.
Jerry Lee Lewis.

2930
02:09:01,210 --> 02:09:02,540
Chuck Barry.
No,

2931
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:04,150
not.
He was crazy man.

2932
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:05,080
Which one?
Jerry Lewis.

2933
02:09:05,090 --> 02:09:08,290
Jerry Lee Lewis was crazy.
He was crazy.

2934
02:09:09,570 --> 02:09:10,470
Yeah.
That guy was nuts.

2935
02:09:10,471 --> 02:09:11,280
Yeah.
He had a fight.

2936
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:16,340
He got in a fistfight with Chuck Berry.
Yeah.

2937
02:09:18,730 --> 02:09:21,100
Jerry Lewis.
Jerry Lee Lewis.

2938
02:09:21,790 --> 02:09:26,600
Chuck Berry feud.
Yeah.

2939
02:09:26,601 --> 02:09:27,380
These were.
I mean,

2940
02:09:27,381 --> 02:09:28,790
think about these types of people.
I mean,

2941
02:09:28,791 --> 02:09:30,950
these are wild motherfuckers.
Just Jerry.

2942
02:09:31,010 --> 02:09:32,850
Just just thinking Chuck Berry.
Thank you.

2943
02:09:32,851 --> 02:09:34,430
Get in a fight with a guy like Chuck 
Perry.

2944
02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:39,460
He's doing time.
Does a year and a half in the pokey for 

2945
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:41,960
transport and the girl across state 
lines.

2946
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:44,000
Apparently he sinks of Asian.

2947
02:09:44,090 --> 02:09:48,350
Apparently caught the piano of fire.
Then walked off stage telling Barry,

2948
02:09:48,510 --> 02:09:51,060
follow that n word in order to.
Yeah,

2949
02:09:51,080 --> 02:09:54,260
to intention.
If he actually did say an inward fall,

2950
02:09:54,261 --> 02:09:56,750
that n word,
it was a sad time,

2951
02:09:57,950 --> 02:09:58,700
sad time

2952
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:02,740
and that that whole lifestyle,
golden to prison and coming out.

2953
02:10:02,770 --> 02:10:05,980
Oh yeah.
I love Chinese food.

2954
02:10:05,981 --> 02:10:09,570
Too much walking around too much.
Fuck you.

2955
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:12,240
Especially in the sixties,
especially the sixth.

2956
02:10:12,250 --> 02:10:16,090
Especially doing title give.
They all listen.

2957
02:10:16,150 --> 02:10:19,250
Anytime that you glorify on television,
that's bullshit.

2958
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:24,270
You still want to see your family to be 
65 and Olivia whole life and think that 

2959
02:10:24,341 --> 02:10:28,930
you were a gangster and to get put in 
jail when you're 50 and have to be 67 in

2960
02:10:28,931 --> 02:10:31,010
fucking prison.
Let's say nobody gonna rape you.

2961
02:10:31,011 --> 02:10:32,710
They beat you up.
Just the thought.

2962
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:33,710
Just being

2963
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:37,350
freedom removed and you see these idiots
on discovery channel.

2964
02:10:37,351 --> 02:10:38,780
Like when they do it was prison.
It shows them,

2965
02:10:38,781 --> 02:10:41,060
and I'm on the road,
I'll stay up late writing,

2966
02:10:41,061 --> 02:10:44,390
but I put that channel on and I watched 
the interviews of these guys like,

2967
02:10:44,391 --> 02:10:45,520
yeah,
you know I did it.

2968
02:10:45,530 --> 02:10:48,530
What the fuck did you do?
You fucking pissed away a life.

2969
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:50,750
Pissed away.
A fucking light.

2970
02:10:50,900 --> 02:10:52,820
You do two,
three years when you're 18,

2971
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,080
that ain't shit.
Joe Rogan.

2972
02:10:54,081 --> 02:10:55,880
Anybody could do it.
Standing in the fucking head.

2973
02:10:55,990 --> 02:11:00,990
Did you hear about that guy that they 
just arrested that was living in the 

2974
02:11:00,990 --> 02:11:04,060
woods of Maine by himself?
He hadn't talked to another person in 30

2975
02:11:04,061 --> 02:11:09,061
years and he had been surviving all this
time by stealing things from 

2976
02:11:09,061 --> 02:11:13,900
campgrounds.
Didn't talk to people for 30 fucking 

2977
02:11:13,900 --> 02:11:14,610
years until the,
uh,

2978
02:11:14,611 --> 02:11:19,611
the police finally arrested him.
So he was basically like a fucking kid 

2979
02:11:19,611 --> 02:11:21,740
and just disappeared.
He,

2980
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:23,050
yeah,
27 years.

2981
02:11:23,051 --> 02:11:26,890
He lived in the woods for 27 years.
He didn't speak to another person.

2982
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:29,770
He just lived in the woods,
snuck into camp grounds,

2983
02:11:29,860 --> 02:11:31,900
stole shit,
and went back to his camp.

2984
02:11:32,110 --> 02:11:37,110
And so they arrest this guy.
He's got this a spot and they have all 

2985
02:11:37,110 --> 02:11:37,700
these pictures of it.
Um,

2986
02:11:37,810 --> 02:11:41,050
if you go to the Kennebec Journal,
Kj online.com,

2987
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:45,350
Kennebec K and N,
b e c and e,

2988
02:11:45,370 --> 02:11:50,370
b e c k e n n e b e c.
it's a part of Maine where this guy was 

2989
02:11:50,370 --> 02:11:51,580
a Kennebunk port,
right?

2990
02:11:51,581 --> 02:11:54,820
Where her,
that's where a Bush had his compound out

2991
02:11:54,821 --> 02:11:55,780
there,
his family,

2992
02:11:55,781 --> 02:11:59,590
the older Bush,
but this guy man was just live in like a

2993
02:11:59,591 --> 02:12:04,591
character in a movie by himself,
not talking to any human beings and then

2994
02:12:04,961 --> 02:12:06,820
in the middle of the night,
stealing people's shit.

2995
02:12:07,900 --> 02:12:08,530
Pretty nuts.

2996
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:12,750
Rosters death on the fucking night with 
the dog.

2997
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:16,480
This is a really amazing man.
That's fucking crazy.

2998
02:12:16,690 --> 02:12:20,230
Especially in Maine.
Maine is unfucking.

2999
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:22,960
Bearably cold in the winter.
It's really,

3000
02:12:22,961 --> 02:12:25,110
really cold.
New York is called,

3001
02:12:25,370 --> 02:12:28,060
is cold,
colder Maine as a motherfucker.

3002
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:29,950
Is that feeling when you get out of your
car,

3003
02:12:29,951 --> 02:12:32,440
you just get.
It's a totally different kind of is show

3004
02:12:32,441 --> 02:12:34,180
what the inside of his heart look like.
Yeah,

3005
02:12:34,181 --> 02:12:34,570
yeah,
yeah.

3006
02:12:34,571 --> 02:12:39,571
They got a video.
There's a video up there of this guy's 

3007
02:12:39,571 --> 02:12:39,571
place.
It's got all things hanging.

3008
02:12:39,571 --> 02:12:41,350
You know,
everything's hanging from a wall even as

3009
02:12:41,351 --> 02:12:43,780
a clock that he's getting taped up to a 
tree,

3010
02:12:43,781 --> 02:12:48,781
stole someone's clock,
like stole all this shit and just like 

3011
02:12:48,781 --> 02:12:52,640
packed,
crowded into this weird sort of tent 

3012
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:55,041
that he has set up in the middle of the 
main fucking all kinds of people.

3013
02:12:56,370 --> 02:12:57,920
Man,
no,

3014
02:12:58,230 --> 02:13:03,230
he lit fires and shit.
We were starting to see because of the 

3015
02:13:03,230 --> 02:13:07,380
we can get a story like this online so 
easily and read into it that you've 

3016
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:08,680
never had anything like this 20 years 
and he never got these stories.

3017
02:13:08,950 --> 02:13:11,320
They didn't show it on 20 slash 20 or on
one of those.

3018
02:13:11,321 --> 02:13:16,321
You never really got like this sort of 
an in depth look at wackiness and we're 

3019
02:13:16,321 --> 02:13:18,250
getting it every day.
Every day there's like some new dude.

3020
02:13:18,251 --> 02:13:23,251
It gets caught doing something really 
fucking weird and then you look at them 

3021
02:13:23,251 --> 02:13:23,251
and you go,
who is this crazy fuck?

3022
02:13:23,251 --> 02:13:28,051
What's going on here?
And then you'll forget about them 

3023
02:13:28,051 --> 02:13:30,481
because tomorrow it's a dude has got a 
pet hippo that he rides around until it 

3024
02:13:30,481 --> 02:13:33,810
eats them and then he'd go what a 
fucking weighed them and then the next 

3025
02:13:33,810 --> 02:13:33,840
day it's another story.
It's just,

3026
02:13:33,841 --> 02:13:38,841
it never ends.
The guy walks into home depot yesterday 

3027
02:13:38,841 --> 02:13:39,810
and tried to cut his arm off here that I
walk into.

3028
02:13:39,811 --> 02:13:44,811
Home Depot picks up a saw and starts 
hacking his fucking arm off God down to 

3029
02:13:44,811 --> 02:13:46,190
the bone,
screaming hot,

3030
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:47,910
fucking in cutting his arm.

3031
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:49,560
They got down to the bone until they 
stopped him.

3032
02:13:49,940 --> 02:13:53,310
Wow.
What the fuck?

3033
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:55,190
Really?
Joe Diaz.

3034
02:13:55,450 --> 02:13:56,940
I'll stop and thinking about that for a 
moment.

3035
02:13:56,941 --> 02:14:00,660
I kind of walks into home depot and saws
his own fucking arm off.

3036
02:14:01,770 --> 02:14:05,790
Can you imagine being in this shit?
Why you go in there just to get a gallon

3037
02:14:05,791 --> 02:14:10,791
of paint.
You got to put up with this fucking guy 

3038
02:14:10,791 --> 02:14:11,040
now doing this.
It's just you.

3039
02:14:11,410 --> 02:14:14,280
You might be there in the wrong place.
Wrong time.

3040
02:14:14,281 --> 02:14:19,281
When that guy does that or does 
something even nuttier that harms other 

3041
02:14:19,281 --> 02:14:19,281
people,
you know,

3042
02:14:19,281 --> 02:14:21,600
I would like to find out what that guy 
was on.

3043
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:24,630
You know,
I would love to know what these guys.

3044
02:14:24,660 --> 02:14:26,520
Life Tail.
I guarantee life.

3045
02:14:26,580 --> 02:14:28,650
That's it.
They lost a mortgage.

3046
02:14:28,651 --> 02:14:30,330
They lost the house.
The wife left.

3047
02:14:30,750 --> 02:14:33,900
The kid is on drugs.
The other kid's a fucking moron.

3048
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:35,730
God knows because a lot of that.

3049
02:14:35,790 --> 02:14:37,820
There's a lot of life going on,
man.

3050
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:39,930
It's tough for people right now.
You know,

3051
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:43,590
you really think about what's going on.
They got missiles pointed at us,

3052
02:14:43,591 --> 02:14:44,730
whatever the fuck,
listen,

3053
02:14:44,910 --> 02:14:49,910
if he launches them,
I'm sure United States and do what they 

3054
02:14:49,910 --> 02:14:52,521
can and will will be fine.
It's just the thought that it's right 

3055
02:14:52,521 --> 02:14:56,121
there.
It's right fucking there were about to 

3056
02:14:56,121 --> 02:14:57,540
be part of this.
Everything will change everything.

3057
02:14:57,570 --> 02:15:02,570
You know,
what people don't realize who haven't 

3058
02:15:02,570 --> 02:15:03,330
been over there like you and I,
we don't.

3059
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:07,740
We don't realize what the actual 
conditions are in that country.

3060
02:15:07,860 --> 02:15:10,350
And when you read about it,
it almost seems like fiction,

3061
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:15,860
you know,
when you read about the slave camps and 

3062
02:15:15,860 --> 02:15:15,860
people were born in the slum camps and 
you know,

3063
02:15:15,860 --> 02:15:20,331
some of them escaped and they tell these
stories of like how weakened they let 

3064
02:15:20,331 --> 02:15:23,841
people get and then they like literally 
like people are eating rats and shit 

3065
02:15:23,841 --> 02:15:23,841
trying to stay alive.

3066
02:15:23,841 --> 02:15:26,640
We have North Korea slave camps.
It's horrible.

3067
02:15:26,641 --> 02:15:28,400
Horrible Shit.
Why is that a slave camp?

3068
02:15:28,550 --> 02:15:31,290
Because I dunno man.
Well they vice.com

3069
02:15:31,291 --> 02:15:33,840
exposed that they have slave camps in 
Siberia.

3070
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:37,920
The North Koreans have a slave camp in 
Siberia and the people in Siberia,

3071
02:15:37,921 --> 02:15:39,570
they don't even know that they're not in
North Korea.

3072
02:15:39,630 --> 02:15:44,630
They think they're in North Korea,
but really they're in a slave camp in 

3073
02:15:44,630 --> 02:15:45,150
Siberia.
It's really fucking crazy.

3074
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:48,240
And what would I can't wrap my head 
around?

3075
02:15:48,241 --> 02:15:49,860
I don't think,
and I don't think either you can,

3076
02:15:49,861 --> 02:15:54,861
you,
is that these people are living like 

3077
02:15:54,861 --> 02:15:58,040
Stalinist Russia.
They're living like a real communist 

3078
02:15:58,040 --> 02:15:59,190
dictatorial sort of,
you know,

3079
02:15:59,730 --> 02:16:01,770
you big view of the world,
you know,

3080
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:05,310
their idea of,
of life is they have dear leader.

3081
02:16:05,530 --> 02:16:07,800
You know when people didn't cry for dear
leader,

3082
02:16:08,130 --> 02:16:09,240
you don't want.
The guy died.

3083
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:12,240
People didn't cry.
I got sentenced to six months in jail.

3084
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:15,150
They sent some people to jail because 
they didn't cry.

3085
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:18,390
So people like if you ever see the video
of people crying,

3086
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:23,600
it is the most ridiculous overproduced,
overactive nuttiness that you've ever 

3087
02:16:23,731 --> 02:16:26,490
seen in your life.
It's people just terrified.

3088
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:30,040
It's really sad to watch because these 
people are terrified and

3089
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:33,210
they're wandering around crying,
just wailing.

3090
02:16:33,220 --> 02:16:36,490
It's so fake looking.
It looks so fake,

3091
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:40,150
but it's like they have to put on a show
that the government is so,

3092
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:40,730
it's,
they're,

3093
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:45,780
they're so controlled.
It's such a horrible dictatorship that 

3094
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:47,560
the,
if you're not crying for the Guy Dying,

3095
02:16:47,830 --> 02:16:52,210
they just throw you in a fucking cage.
Yeah.

3096
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:55,240
The balance of power for whatever 
reason,

3097
02:16:55,241 --> 02:16:59,410
people always want to get to that sort 
of total dictatorial position.

3098
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:00,880
Like even the guy who,
uh,

3099
02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:03,580
who was the overthrowing of the 
government in Egypt,

3100
02:17:04,330 --> 02:17:09,330
the new people that came in were like 
adults and I don't think the law should 

3101
02:17:09,330 --> 02:17:09,330
apply to us and we're going to do.
And everybody was like,

3102
02:17:09,330 --> 02:17:11,650
what?
Like there was like riots in the street.

3103
02:17:11,651 --> 02:17:12,040
They're like,
well,

3104
02:17:12,041 --> 02:17:17,041
this is what we just got rid of.
Like you're trying to do exactly what 

3105
02:17:17,041 --> 02:17:17,041
the government before you like.

3106
02:17:17,041 --> 02:17:18,670
I see where you're going with this.
He crazy fucks.

3107
02:17:19,750 --> 02:17:23,260
It's almost like a slave camp.
What is the purpose of a slave?

3108
02:17:23,261 --> 02:17:24,580
They're making them where they're 
working.

3109
02:17:24,581 --> 02:17:25,990
They're making things,
whatever it is.

3110
02:17:26,220 --> 02:17:28,170
I mean,
North Korea has almost no money there.

3111
02:17:28,171 --> 02:17:31,120
They're unbelievably broke.
If you fly over North Korea at night,

3112
02:17:31,121 --> 02:17:33,370
the lights are out.
They shut their lights off at night,

3113
02:17:33,610 --> 02:17:35,980
whereas you go to South Korea,
looks like any other part of the world.

3114
02:17:35,981 --> 02:17:40,981
We see people's lights on.
North Korea doesn't even have enough 

3115
02:17:40,981 --> 02:17:40,981
money to keep the lights on me.
It's a,

3116
02:17:40,981 --> 02:17:40,981
it's an uh,
it's terrible.

3117
02:17:40,990 --> 02:17:43,390
You can't run a country like that.
They're not going to profit.

3118
02:17:43,391 --> 02:17:48,391
They're not going to prosper.
Like the only way to have a really 

3119
02:17:48,391 --> 02:17:50,611
strong economy is you have a lot to,
a lot of people that are trying to make 

3120
02:17:50,611 --> 02:17:53,731
things happen.
Not just like the people that are in 

3121
02:17:53,731 --> 02:17:53,731
charge and then their slaves.

3122
02:17:53,731 --> 02:17:54,970
You can't run it like that.
You know,

3123
02:17:54,971 --> 02:17:59,971
you can't run it where you,
the entire civilization is under your 

3124
02:17:59,971 --> 02:18:00,250
heel because a strong man is going to 
prosper.

3125
02:18:00,251 --> 02:18:05,251
A strong woman is going to prosper and 
anybody that knows they're under the 

3126
02:18:05,251 --> 02:18:06,190
heel of the government like that.
They're never going to prosper.

3127
02:18:06,310 --> 02:18:07,840
So the economy is never going to be 
vital.

3128
02:18:07,841 --> 02:18:12,841
It's never going to be like no one's 
going to be out there trying to make 

3129
02:18:12,841 --> 02:18:12,910
shit happen and kick ass and take names 
and you know,

3130
02:18:12,911 --> 02:18:13,360
and,
and,

3131
02:18:13,361 --> 02:18:15,250
and keep the,
the economy energized.

3132
02:18:15,670 --> 02:18:20,670
They're fucking terrified.
They're terrified of jackbooted thugs 

3133
02:18:20,670 --> 02:18:24,030
coming into the house and locking them 
in a cage because they weren't fake 

3134
02:18:24,030 --> 02:18:24,030
crying enough,
you know,

3135
02:18:24,030 --> 02:18:26,260
and it's 2013.
That's the funniest part about it.

3136
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:31,530
So this is happening right now,
just like you and I are taking fucking 

3137
02:18:31,530 --> 02:18:35,101
southwest to San Jose and having a good 
time and fucking driving to Vegas and 

3138
02:18:35,101 --> 02:18:36,220
waving at people at the gas station.

3139
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:41,520
These fucking people in another part of 
the world right now are living in a 

3140
02:18:41,520 --> 02:18:41,640
horror movie.
Fucking amazing.

3141
02:18:41,810 --> 02:18:44,290
You imagine men living in a horror 
movie.

3142
02:18:44,530 --> 02:18:46,900
I mean you,
you literally are living in Star Wars.

3143
02:18:47,140 --> 02:18:49,750
They might as well be stormtroopers.
That might as well be darth vader.

3144
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:52,900
You really are.
That means they have nuclear power.

3145
02:18:53,530 --> 02:18:55,090
They have nuclear power and machine 
guns,

3146
02:18:55,150 --> 02:19:00,150
tanks,
and they're all willing to walk in a 

3147
02:19:00,150 --> 02:19:00,150
straight line without lifting the leg up
at the same time.

3148
02:19:00,610 --> 02:19:04,510
Which is scary for us when everybody 
moves mindlessly in a unit together.

3149
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:05,470
Left,
right,

3150
02:19:05,530 --> 02:19:06,250
left,
right.

3151
02:19:06,370 --> 02:19:08,980
That scares the shit out of us because 
that means you're willing to do whatever

3152
02:19:08,981 --> 02:19:11,710
the fuck they tell you once they got you
marching like that left,

3153
02:19:11,711 --> 02:19:12,160
right,
left,

3154
02:19:12,161 --> 02:19:12,400
right?
Well,

3155
02:19:12,401 --> 02:19:15,250
you can't just walk in carrying guns.
How impressive is that?

3156
02:19:15,490 --> 02:19:20,490
Let me tell you something.
Just walk in carrying those guns and it 

3157
02:19:20,490 --> 02:19:21,610
was going to shit their pants anyway,
but you're walking in with that.

3158
02:19:24,030 --> 02:19:28,440
The sergeant,
Sergeant Carlos.

3159
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:29,530
What is that?
Yeah,

3160
02:19:29,540 --> 02:19:34,540
what is that?
You're letting people know that you've 

3161
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:36,781
got these motherfuckers under control 
completely under control and you're 

3162
02:19:37,430 --> 02:19:42,430
doing that while you're in this 
nightmare of a dictatorial society.

3163
02:19:45,800 --> 02:19:47,450
It's got to be horrific to live over 
there.

3164
02:19:47,880 --> 02:19:49,730
She rolled the dice.
Oh,

3165
02:19:49,790 --> 02:19:52,760
I was so pissed because I got to go.
So lucky.

3166
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:58,300
So lucky [inaudible] one on one at 5:00
and pisses me the fuck off.

3167
02:19:58,570 --> 02:20:00,380
So there's no traffic like New York 
traffic.

3168
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:01,410
How bad is it?
God?

3169
02:20:01,510 --> 02:20:02,510
It's just like,
all right,

3170
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:03,950
this dress,
it's very bad.

3171
02:20:03,951 --> 02:20:06,350
I read this.
I can't believe it will go over.

3172
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:09,710
That's why I said to you,
the tunnels and bridges and getting into

3173
02:20:09,711 --> 02:20:12,270
the tunnels and bridges can be insanity.
Insanity.

3174
02:20:12,590 --> 02:20:13,460
It can be like,
okay,

3175
02:20:13,461 --> 02:20:15,350
this was not happening.
Like how long does this take?

3176
02:20:15,910 --> 02:20:18,530
It's craziness.
The amount of humans and by the way,

3177
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:20,010
no one's driving.
Okay.

3178
02:20:20,090 --> 02:20:23,720
Everyone's taking cabs,
so if most of the people in the city are

3179
02:20:23,721 --> 02:20:28,721
taking cabs,
it's the rare few that are clogging it 

3180
02:20:28,721 --> 02:20:30,770
up like this.
The amount of traffic does not need even

3181
02:20:30,771 --> 02:20:32,990
closely represent the amount of actual 
humans.

3182
02:20:32,991 --> 02:20:35,510
Luckily because the amount of humans is 
staggering,

3183
02:20:35,690 --> 02:20:37,400
but most of them are not taking cars.

3184
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:40,580
I'm explaining something to you and 94,
I was doing comedy and I went back.

3185
02:20:40,581 --> 02:20:43,820
That was an open mic or I lived in New 
Jersey.

3186
02:20:43,860 --> 02:20:48,110
I dated a girl on 15th and Ninth Avenue 
by Honda of Manhattan.

3187
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:53,800
Joe Rogan.
I'm telling you I could get into my car 

3188
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:53,800
to coordinate and be in Manhattan at 10 
after eight.

3189
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:56,240
You know me know how the fuck is.
I pick her up.

3190
02:20:56,241 --> 02:20:58,460
My show would be at nine in the New York
comedy club.

3191
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,670
About three years ago.
I went into New York City,

3192
02:21:01,671 --> 02:21:03,530
I had to pick my buddy up at the bus 
station.

3193
02:21:03,830 --> 02:21:08,830
I'd never seen anything like that while 
I thought it was going to take me an 

3194
02:21:08,830 --> 02:21:10,670
hour,
tops took me four fucking hours.

3195
02:21:10,870 --> 02:21:13,380
I'm not shocked.
I don't know that.

3196
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:16,280
Then there's nothing I want to do that 
anymore.

3197
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:20,770
I want to go get a hotdog.
I take the bus and the train over,

3198
02:21:21,550 --> 02:21:24,470
but I'm either taking them are over.
Those days are done.

3199
02:21:24,850 --> 02:21:27,730
I was hanging out with Shane Smith from 
vice.com

3200
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:32,780
or right.
He lives in New York and he has this 

3201
02:21:32,780 --> 02:21:35,350
view window that it's like mountains.
It doesn't even seem real.

3202
02:21:35,440 --> 02:21:36,670
His,
his view is like,

3203
02:21:36,671 --> 02:21:39,400
it's like you're looking at like 
mountains.

3204
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:42,040
They're mechanical mountains that people
create.

3205
02:21:42,041 --> 02:21:45,790
It's more beautiful even than the 
mountains that the New York City skyline

3206
02:21:45,791 --> 02:21:50,791
is fucking staggering.
It's so impressive that it's almost 

3207
02:21:50,791 --> 02:21:54,001
worth being there just to see it on a 
regular basis because it really is like 

3208
02:21:54,001 --> 02:21:56,380
a work of art just like the mountains 
are.

3209
02:21:56,530 --> 02:21:58,750
You know,
the reason why people are willing to pay

3210
02:21:58,751 --> 02:22:01,390
for paintings and shit because it makes 
you feel good when you see something bad

3211
02:22:01,391 --> 02:22:06,391
ass when you look at something,
something beautiful like this sculpture 

3212
02:22:06,391 --> 02:22:08,260
that this gentleman sent me,
the Buddha for my tattoo that um,

3213
02:22:08,340 --> 02:22:09,490
I,
I love art.

3214
02:22:09,550 --> 02:22:11,290
I like looking at shit that someone 
made,

3215
02:22:11,470 --> 02:22:12,210
you know,
I'd like,

3216
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:16,090
I like things that are beautiful,
but the New York City skyline,

3217
02:22:16,091 --> 02:22:18,310
it's like one of the most beautiful 
things you could see.

3218
02:22:18,610 --> 02:22:20,800
Like when that thing is all lit up and 
the cars are moving,

3219
02:22:20,801 --> 02:22:22,270
you're like,
Whoa,

3220
02:22:22,390 --> 02:22:24,100
I've never seen a pain that makes me do 
that.

3221
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:26,550
I never see a painting.
I see a painting.

3222
02:22:26,551 --> 02:22:27,090
I go,
wow,

3223
02:22:27,091 --> 02:22:28,380
that's cool.
I like that.

3224
02:22:28,410 --> 02:22:29,400
Oh,
that's bad ass.

3225
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:32,550
But I never see a pain that makes me sit
down and open my jaw and go,

3226
02:22:32,551 --> 02:22:37,551
whoa.
But the New York City skyline will make 

3227
02:22:37,551 --> 02:22:37,551
you go,
Whoa,

3228
02:22:37,551 --> 02:22:41,791
and make you sit back.
If you look at it from one of those 

3229
02:22:41,791 --> 02:22:43,850
dudes,
it's got some crazy building with a 

3230
02:22:43,850 --> 02:22:43,850
giant window.
And like a lot of those people that have

3231
02:22:43,850 --> 02:22:47,770
those like 180 degree views like people 
with like crazy cash and giant 

3232
02:22:47,770 --> 02:22:50,010
apartments,
they're view is the greatest view in the

3233
02:22:50,011 --> 02:22:52,020
world.
The view is amazing.

3234
02:22:52,290 --> 02:22:53,990
Seeing all that,
that skyline,

3235
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,480
those lights and the cars moving.
I totally get it now.

3236
02:22:57,481 --> 02:22:58,410
I totally get it.

3237
02:22:59,220 --> 02:23:01,360
They have to live in there.
That's the main thing.

3238
02:23:02,380 --> 02:23:05,440
Like I told you to live in New York is 
live like John Lennon.

3239
02:23:05,620 --> 02:23:07,690
If you're living there,
you're like John Lennon.

3240
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:09,550
It's not.
It's fucking tough.

3241
02:23:09,980 --> 02:23:13,990
That's tough place to live.
They've have to commute from Brooklyn to

3242
02:23:13,991 --> 02:23:15,340
Manhattan.
You know?

3243
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:16,450
It's fucking tough.

3244
02:23:16,530 --> 02:23:18,120
Well,
John Lennon is a perfect example though.

3245
02:23:18,121 --> 02:23:19,190
Why?
What's crazy about it?

3246
02:23:19,210 --> 02:23:21,660
I'm dudes just waiting outside to where 
he knows you live.

3247
02:23:21,930 --> 02:23:24,480
Some wacky dude that wants to shoot you.
You know what I mean?

3248
02:23:24,481 --> 02:23:26,190
That's a secured building.
Yeah.

3249
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:31,220
It doesn't matter.
People know that you live in that 

3250
02:23:31,220 --> 02:23:32,991
secured building and you're John Lennon.
I mean John Lennon was one of the most 

3251
02:23:32,991 --> 02:23:34,560
famous human beings on the planet earth.
They didn't care if this guy's living in

3252
02:23:34,561 --> 02:23:39,270
this building too,
naughty way to live,

3253
02:23:39,780 --> 02:23:42,750
stacked on top,
everybody but God so beautiful.

3254
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:46,320
And we were there and there was a 
lightning storm broke out.

3255
02:23:46,470 --> 02:23:51,470
Fucking a man to be on the 40th floor of
a hotel and look out the window.

3256
02:23:51,511 --> 02:23:53,550
You see lightning dance across the sky.
It's like,

3257
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:58,580
holy fuck.
This is one of the coolest shows you 

3258
02:23:58,580 --> 02:23:58,590
could ever see.
It was amazing.

3259
02:23:59,550 --> 02:24:01,470
New York has stopped.
That really moves me.

3260
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:06,500
You know what?
The terrorists dog subway sandwich 

3261
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:07,650
fucking.
They already got something up.

3262
02:24:08,820 --> 02:24:10,650
They already got that up.
They already got a meme up.

3263
02:24:14,460 --> 02:24:16,110
People would not friendly there though,
man.

3264
02:24:16,111 --> 02:24:21,111
That's,
that's the weird thing is the dealing 

3265
02:24:21,111 --> 02:24:21,111
with that constant stress that went away
after nine slash 11,

3266
02:24:21,570 --> 02:24:26,570
after nine slash 11.
People were super friendly there for 

3267
02:24:26,570 --> 02:24:28,701
awhile.
We filmed fear factor there and like 

3268
02:24:28,701 --> 02:24:28,990
2002 I think.
And um,

3269
02:24:29,150 --> 02:24:30,780
when,
maybe it might've been 2003,

3270
02:24:30,990 --> 02:24:33,120
but everybody was so friendly.
It was,

3271
02:24:33,140 --> 02:24:36,450
it was really interesting.
It was like when we went there,

3272
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:41,540
people were like,
you could noticeably see that there was 

3273
02:24:41,540 --> 02:24:43,750
like an extra effort that people made to
be nice to people that felt it.

3274
02:24:43,751 --> 02:24:46,170
It was like a fountain in the air and I 
remember thinking,

3275
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:47,940
hmm,
how long will this last?

3276
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:53,300
You know,
like this is a new change of the way 

3277
02:24:53,300 --> 02:24:53,300
people are behaving in New York.
I want to.

3278
02:24:53,300 --> 02:24:53,520
How long it lasts.
It lasts a long time.

3279
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:59,240
It lasted quite a few years before I 
started feeling like it was back to 

3280
02:24:59,240 --> 02:25:00,600
normal again.
This last trip back to normal.

3281
02:25:01,290 --> 02:25:02,280
Solely back.
Yeah.

3282
02:25:02,281 --> 02:25:04,650
People are.
They just some people.

3283
02:25:04,651 --> 02:25:06,680
I mean there's plenty of Nice folks in 
New York just like this,

3284
02:25:06,690 --> 02:25:08,880
playing Nice folks everywhere.
We met a lot of Nice folks.

3285
02:25:09,020 --> 02:25:10,790
The funny thing is when I walk in New 
York,

3286
02:25:10,791 --> 02:25:13,190
there's some stuff that just fucking 
moves me.

3287
02:25:13,790 --> 02:25:17,120
It moves me because I remember coming 
off from Cuba and walking in and being a

3288
02:25:17,121 --> 02:25:22,121
little kid.
I'm a walking down Broadway and seeing 

3289
02:25:22,121 --> 02:25:24,400
the first wall poster to her secret 
service.

3290
02:25:24,730 --> 02:25:27,970
That's a James Bond movie with in 
between James Bond.

3291
02:25:28,270 --> 02:25:31,630
His name was George Lazenby.
He was in between Roger Moore,

3292
02:25:31,631 --> 02:25:32,730
I guess.
Really?

3293
02:25:32,770 --> 02:25:33,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

3294
02:25:33,491 --> 02:25:37,180
Look it up.
Diana Rigg Kojak was in the movie.

3295
02:25:37,660 --> 02:25:39,910
It's called our majesty's secret 
service.

3296
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:43,180
Came out in 1969,
maybe 68,

3297
02:25:43,181 --> 02:25:46,300
maybe 70.
How many James Bonds were there?

3298
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:47,980
The new ones.
The best.

3299
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:51,550
That guy is fucking bad ass.
Bad Ass.

3300
02:25:51,580 --> 02:25:52,480
He's the best.
He was.

3301
02:25:52,481 --> 02:25:54,600
He's good.
But Roger Moore's good to Roger Morris.

3302
02:25:54,601 --> 02:25:59,601
Good live and let live.
And let my Roger Moore can fuck with 

3303
02:25:59,601 --> 02:26:01,090
Sean Connery and Roger are.
These are the men.

3304
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:03,790
David Nivon was the first one.
Oh No,

3305
02:26:03,791 --> 02:26:03,920
no,
no,

3306
02:26:03,921 --> 02:26:05,220
no.
Let's listen to this church.

3307
02:26:05,230 --> 02:26:08,950
This is crazy.
Barry Nelson was the first one in 1954.

3308
02:26:08,951 --> 02:26:13,951
Even before sean connery.
So Sean connery was 62 to 1971.

3309
02:26:15,010 --> 02:26:20,010
And again he came back,
don't call it a comeback and 83 took a 

3310
02:26:20,010 --> 02:26:23,080
12 year hiatus and then came back with a
new wig.

3311
02:26:23,650 --> 02:26:26,980
And then there's David Nivon who fucks 
David Nevon.

3312
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:30,010
They tried David Nevon out in 67,
right?

3313
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:35,040
That shit didn't work.
And then they tried George Lazenby and 

3314
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:35,140
tried that out in [inaudible] 69,
the movie.

3315
02:26:35,141 --> 02:26:38,070
And then there's another guy,
Christopher Kazen,

3316
02:26:38,430 --> 02:26:42,520
cazenove cazenove because yeah.
See it's,

3317
02:26:42,521 --> 02:26:46,870
it's,
it's Ca z e n o v e and then Roger Moore

3318
02:26:46,871 --> 02:26:51,871
from [inaudible] 73.
Which ones at Roger More live and let 

3319
02:26:51,871 --> 02:26:51,871
die to.
Good question.

3320
02:26:51,871 --> 02:26:54,610
But do you remember Timothy Dalton and 
Pierce Brosnan?

3321
02:26:54,611 --> 02:26:59,611
There was two duds in a row to like 
fucking total duds out here,

3322
02:27:00,350 --> 02:27:01,850
man.
Like the same person.

3323
02:27:02,550 --> 02:27:04,690
It's probably Timothy Dalton was talking
shit.

3324
02:27:04,691 --> 02:27:06,910
And I love to.
We've got Pierce Brosnan on speed dial.

3325
02:27:08,260 --> 02:27:11,390
Bronson would probably be good,
but get out.

3326
02:27:11,570 --> 02:27:16,570
Fuck out of here at both those guys.
I can imagine those guys kicking 

3327
02:27:16,570 --> 02:27:19,681
anybody's ass ever.
I imagine them getting hit and just 

3328
02:27:19,681 --> 02:27:19,681
start crying.
But Daniel Craig,

3329
02:27:19,681 --> 02:27:21,040
I could see that guy kicking someone's 
ass.

3330
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:26,040
I totally 100 percent,
but I think he's the best one of all 

3331
02:27:26,040 --> 02:27:26,040
time.
He's a beast.

3332
02:27:26,380 --> 02:27:28,120
He like,
he seems like a killer.

3333
02:27:28,150 --> 02:27:33,150
Like when I'm watching them,
it seems like the type of guy who would 

3334
02:27:33,150 --> 02:27:34,690
be like a problem drinking womanizing,
trained killer.

3335
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:38,020
Like it all came together in the most 
realistic version of it,

3336
02:27:38,170 --> 02:27:39,850
but I had a lot of people said it 
sucked,

3337
02:27:39,851 --> 02:27:40,720
man.
It's funny.

3338
02:27:41,470 --> 02:27:44,200
There's dude posted on the message board
that I go to.

3339
02:27:44,270 --> 02:27:46,450
How fucking everybody told them was the 
best bond era is like,

3340
02:27:46,451 --> 02:27:48,850
holy shit was at a piece of garbage and 
I was like,

3341
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,070
man,
I didn't get that.

3342
02:27:50,071 --> 02:27:55,071
I thought it was.
It was Roger Moore's shotgun before you 

3343
02:27:55,071 --> 02:27:55,330
fuck out of here.
I'm telling you dog live and let die.

3344
02:27:55,400 --> 02:28:00,400
Roger.
I'm telling you that that was a Rogan.

3345
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:04,930
I was just puking the whole time.
He had his finger up your ass.

3346
02:28:04,931 --> 02:28:08,920
That's the whole thing about those guys.
That's what it means to be fucking James

3347
02:28:08,920 --> 02:28:09,970
Bond.
That's what it means.

3348
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:11,550
That's right.
The Suave,

3349
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:12,720
debonair,
finger up your ass.

3350
02:28:12,870 --> 02:28:15,820
He was a swab that I'm telling you.
I didn't think so either.

3351
02:28:15,990 --> 02:28:20,990
See,
I grew up on the saint when the saint 

3352
02:28:20,990 --> 02:28:22,970
was popular when I moved here.
So it was the Saint Roger Moore.

3353
02:28:23,170 --> 02:28:26,420
The saint was a TV show with a circle 
around his fucking.

3354
02:28:26,421 --> 02:28:28,450
That shit the fuck.
No,

3355
02:28:28,510 --> 02:28:28,780
no,
no,

3356
02:28:28,781 --> 02:28:29,150
no,
no.

3357
02:28:29,151 --> 02:28:31,390
That was the watch.
Roger Moore.

3358
02:28:31,410 --> 02:28:34,580
The is yet he has his own TV show.
Yeah.

3359
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:36,280
He had a halo.
Yeah.

3360
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:38,860
That was the commercial for that.
What's the name of the show?

3361
02:28:39,890 --> 02:28:41,190
The mentalist.
A mentalist.

3362
02:28:42,060 --> 02:28:42,560
Ain't.

3365
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:47,170
Yeah.
Tremendous.

3366
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:50,180
But what was better?
That or the Danny bonaduce show.

3367
02:28:50,840 --> 02:28:52,250
Remember that?
Anybody listen bro.

Drop some shows on you that's going to 

3369
02:28:57,251 --> 02:28:58,751
bust your fucking head.
I'm going to tell you some good shows 

3370
02:28:58,751 --> 02:29:00,731
right now.
It takes a fucking thief were fucking 

3371
02:29:00,731 --> 02:29:01,610
wagner.
How about the wild wild west?

3372
02:29:01,611 --> 02:29:03,110
It's on now.
Yeah.

3373
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:05,960
I watched that for me in my head.
Blows up,

3374
02:29:05,961 --> 02:29:07,460
bro.
That was a fucking tremendous.

3375
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:10,090
The wild bastards.

3376
02:29:10,120 --> 02:29:11,450
Yes.
What was that guy's name?

3377
02:29:11,810 --> 02:29:14,420
That was the curly haired Brunette 
boost.

3378
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:16,430
What's his name?
I'm like,

3379
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:20,610
this battery off my shoulder.
Will Smith came back to play it right?

3380
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:23,220
He played it later.
Another assault me place.

3381
02:29:23,420 --> 02:29:26,120
I'm not talking about black people in 
the wild.

3382
02:29:26,121 --> 02:29:26,900
Wild West there,
right?

3383
02:29:27,260 --> 02:29:29,420
It was two white dudes.
The guy's name.

3384
02:29:29,421 --> 02:29:32,330
Remember the seventies?
That commercial knocked that battery off

3385
02:29:32,331 --> 02:29:33,990
my shoulder.
He,

3386
02:29:34,110 --> 02:29:36,360
he,
he tough shit.

3387
02:29:36,410 --> 02:29:41,410
Remember that series was 65 to 69,
which was the wild west TV series.

3388
02:29:42,710 --> 02:29:47,710
Sixty five to 69 and the guy was right.
It was Robert Conrad and his buddy Ross 

3389
02:29:49,370 --> 02:29:50,870
Martin who get never get any credit,
man.

3390
02:29:50,871 --> 02:29:54,080
Ross got the shaft.
Nobody gets any credit.

3391
02:29:54,090 --> 02:29:56,210
Dammit.
That was a good show.

3392
02:29:56,860 --> 02:30:01,860
I didn't know it was only four years.
I used to love that show when I was a 

3393
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:03,470
little kid.
The wild,

3394
02:30:03,471 --> 02:30:03,890
wild west.

3395
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:09,280
Don't please.
I remember that was w or the wild wild 

3396
02:30:09,280 --> 02:30:09,280
west.
It takes a thief.

3397
02:30:09,350 --> 02:30:12,980
Those or channel nine shows that channel
11 shows where the honeymooners.

3398
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:15,980
Y'All couple Sanford and son the 
twilight zone.

3399
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:19,970
So you had them all and.
But my Benny Hill was on war.

3400
02:30:19,971 --> 02:30:22,280
That was the beginning of my comedy 
career watching.

3401
02:30:22,590 --> 02:30:24,110
Hell,
if you're not a fan,

3402
02:30:24,290 --> 02:30:27,200
I can't talk to you if some way you 
don't look at me and go,

3403
02:30:27,210 --> 02:30:28,270
yeah,
but Joel,

3404
02:30:28,340 --> 02:30:33,340
you're a fucking animal tip was going to
pop out you.

3405
02:30:35,900 --> 02:30:40,900
She comes once a week.
Somebody showed that debt on television 

3406
02:30:40,900 --> 02:30:41,270
didn't actually show a real tip,
bro.

3407
02:30:41,271 --> 02:30:44,270
They showed something or at least you 
will go crazy.

3408
02:30:44,300 --> 02:30:46,430
You will go crazy.
Everybody in school knew the next day.

3409
02:30:46,790 --> 02:30:49,390
Everybody got to make sure that,
man,

3410
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:51,990
I think you guys hallucinating.
I don't think they ever actually show.

3411
02:30:52,480 --> 02:30:57,260
He'd close.
They got pulled it out when you were 11.

3412
02:30:57,261 --> 02:30:59,450
You lose.
Your face gets red.

3413
02:30:59,451 --> 02:31:00,620
You get dizzy.
Yeah,

3414
02:31:00,621 --> 02:31:02,750
you would get sick.
Couldn't believe it's happening.

3415
02:31:03,740 --> 02:31:05,960
There's certain shows that were awesome 
for kids.

3416
02:31:06,130 --> 02:31:11,130
You know that like if like I guess 
that's how we're looking at things 

3417
02:31:11,130 --> 02:31:11,130
today.
You know,

3418
02:31:11,130 --> 02:31:12,740
we look at shows that are terrible and 
like what the fuck is watching us?

3419
02:31:12,890 --> 02:31:15,800
But like for a little kid they show it's
still be pretty bad ass,

3420
02:31:15,870 --> 02:31:20,870
but the biggest rush,
my biggest crush ever was with Alona 

3421
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:20,870
from good times.

3422
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:25,070
In fact,
I still see that fine black bitch 

3423
02:31:25,070 --> 02:31:25,070
distance like tyler,
you sexy motherfucker.

3424
02:31:25,070 --> 02:31:27,350
She goes on.
In fact you shouldn't buy lady.

3425
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:30,780
And she's still banking with a guy.
Who was that?

3426
02:31:31,060 --> 02:31:33,770
The black chick from a good time.
Well known.

3427
02:31:33,780 --> 02:31:35,630
Another one that lives upstairs to the 
check.

3428
02:31:35,890 --> 02:31:38,280
She was beautiful.
She still wasn't fucking knockout.

3429
02:31:38,310 --> 02:31:39,750
But then the other one died,
right?

3430
02:31:39,751 --> 02:31:43,580
Shirley and Shirley temple.
Was she from good time though?

3431
02:31:43,590 --> 02:31:46,650
She was from John One,
the one with a rerun.

3432
02:31:47,460 --> 02:31:49,700
Which one was that?
That was the one with rerun on it.

3433
02:31:49,701 --> 02:31:51,300
You know those fucking people.
You sure?

3434
02:31:51,380 --> 02:31:51,840
Yeah.
Yeah,

3435
02:31:51,850 --> 02:31:52,350
yeah,
yeah.

3436
02:31:52,380 --> 02:31:53,780
Shirley effort was on a

3437
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:56,880
what's happening.
Right,

3438
02:31:56,881 --> 02:31:57,430
right,
right.

3439
02:31:57,431 --> 02:31:58,480
What happened?
What's happening?

3440
02:31:58,780 --> 02:32:03,420
Can't it kicking in as well?
What is kicking at me?

3441
02:32:03,470 --> 02:32:06,520
Bulking.
So when you look back on shows some,

3442
02:32:06,550 --> 02:32:08,350
some shells.
Fucking hang in there man.

3443
02:32:08,351 --> 02:32:10,630
So like all in the family still hangs in
there,

3444
02:32:10,780 --> 02:32:11,800
you know,
it still hangs in there.

3445
02:32:12,340 --> 02:32:16,440
Print songs.
Prince songs are still fucking bad at.

3446
02:32:16,450 --> 02:32:19,390
I was in the store and uh,
I want to be a lover.

3447
02:32:19,391 --> 02:32:21,190
Came on and I was like,
wow,

3448
02:32:21,250 --> 02:32:24,610
I haven't seen this is like 1980,
wherever the fuck it was 81 or something

3449
02:32:24,611 --> 02:32:25,720
like that.
And I was like,

3450
02:32:25,721 --> 02:32:27,850
this song is still bad.

3451
02:32:28,380 --> 02:32:33,380
Go.
I'm going to tell you what was on the 

3452
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:33,380
way up here.
You motherfuckers.

3453
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:38,030
I was in a car,
I didn't give a fuck about traffic of 

3454
02:32:38,030 --> 02:32:40,521
the Joe Rogan experience.
You don't want it as bad as the one 

3455
02:32:40,521 --> 02:32:40,521
later on.
Oh,

3456
02:32:40,900 --> 02:32:43,440
a boom,
boom,

3457
02:32:43,441 --> 02:32:43,890
boom.

3458
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:46,070
Oh yeah,
boom.

3459
02:32:46,230 --> 02:32:48,360
Yeah,
that's a great sign sign of the Times

3460
02:32:49,210 --> 02:32:51,960
time.
But it's a great song.

3461
02:32:52,650 --> 02:32:57,650
All that thing he was doing in vegas 
where it was a like you would pay 500,

3462
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:00,330
200 people at the,
at the Pearl.

3463
02:33:00,331 --> 02:33:02,490
I guess.
I'm not sure.

3464
02:33:02,500 --> 02:33:03,620
People all attack me like,
yeah,

3465
02:33:03,630 --> 02:33:06,570
he would do so a really small bank for a
lot of money.

3466
02:33:06,750 --> 02:33:08,880
$500.
But you got to call the songs.

3467
02:33:09,030 --> 02:33:09,990
Wow,
that's awesome.

3468
02:33:10,020 --> 02:33:10,950
And you would say,
you know,

3469
02:33:10,951 --> 02:33:12,820
I just,
I always look,

3470
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:17,840
look,
kid rock to you might be some fucking 

3471
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:17,840
redneck.
Okay.

3472
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:21,411
And I.
and he probably is and his uncle does 

3473
02:33:21,411 --> 02:33:21,411
math or whatever,
but it doesn't really matter.

3474
02:33:21,411 --> 02:33:22,980
One thing about kid rock is he knows 
music.

3475
02:33:23,690 --> 02:33:28,690
You know,
one thing about comedy is I may not be 

3476
02:33:28,690 --> 02:33:30,831
the funniest guy in the world,
but I love watching old comedy to see 

3477
02:33:30,831 --> 02:33:31,020
where I came from.
Jonathan.

3478
02:33:31,021 --> 02:33:32,490
Yeah.
Jonathan winters talking.

3479
02:33:32,730 --> 02:33:37,730
Why I,
I'm a big fucking a Bruce Guy and you 

3480
02:33:37,730 --> 02:33:37,890
know,
Jackie gleason,

3481
02:33:37,891 --> 02:33:42,891
I love to watch that stuff and when I 
talked to somebody and when you talk to 

3482
02:33:42,891 --> 02:33:43,410
somebody you might not like something 
about them,

3483
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:46,590
but just the people they admire,
you understand where they come from.

3484
02:33:46,590 --> 02:33:51,590
We're talking about this earlier,
but if somebody sold you on twitter and 

3485
02:33:51,590 --> 02:33:51,590
you go to that page and go,
I get it,

3486
02:33:51,990 --> 02:33:54,180
you know what I'm saying?
They were riding around with a wig on or

3487
02:33:54,181 --> 02:33:59,181
some shit.
I understand now why they repeated this 

3488
02:33:59,181 --> 02:34:02,180
with the same thing with me with comics,
you know like what you all combined.

3489
02:34:02,310 --> 02:34:07,310
So I like to know what people like you,
we talk about x and your dad was 

3490
02:34:07,310 --> 02:34:11,751
thinking about it because one of my 
influences also was Lenny Clarke 

3491
02:34:11,751 --> 02:34:14,550
believable telling you I love Lenny 
Clark and he become a major star.

3492
02:34:14,551 --> 02:34:15,830
Whatever.
Yeah.

3493
02:34:15,900 --> 02:34:19,060
To me he was because he made me get off 
my fucking ass.

3494
02:34:19,390 --> 02:34:21,360
I liked what he was doing onstage.
You know,

3495
02:34:21,380 --> 02:34:23,190
Lenny,
the other guy from Washington.

3496
02:34:23,191 --> 02:34:28,191
I like to.
There's a couple of guys from Boston I 

3497
02:34:28,191 --> 02:34:28,191
really,
really fucking like that.

3498
02:34:28,191 --> 02:34:29,800
They might not be stars to you,
but they're stars to me.

3499
02:34:29,801 --> 02:34:30,690
I thought so,
you know?

3500
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:31,990
Yeah.
There was a,

3501
02:34:32,180 --> 02:34:33,700
you know,
we came from an era.

3502
02:34:33,701 --> 02:34:36,340
There was a lot of great comics from 
like the eighties and nineties,

3503
02:34:36,341 --> 02:34:38,650
like we were talking about Ira.
We don't get recognized today.

3504
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:41,320
There was some guys that was,
there was some goddamn killers.

3505
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:43,200
Teddy bears.
Teddy bears on is one.

3506
02:34:43,201 --> 02:34:48,201
It doesn't get nearly enough credit 
because he tripped over his own 

3507
02:34:48,201 --> 02:34:51,250
addictions in his life,
but that guy at times so was like one of

3508
02:34:51,251 --> 02:34:52,340
the best comics I've ever seen him

3509
02:34:52,460 --> 02:34:57,460
tell you something.
I listened to an old Hedberg out and I 

3510
02:34:57,460 --> 02:35:01,730
had to stop and check myself when I 
realized how bad I really was as a 

3511
02:35:01,730 --> 02:35:02,550
fucking comment.
I was listening to him in the car,

3512
02:35:02,551 --> 02:35:06,270
the idea of the college challenge.
Nashville fucking what a great town.

3513
02:35:06,271 --> 02:35:08,190
Just try me.
I got a great hamburger.

3514
02:35:08,191 --> 02:35:10,370
The guy night this place.
Jimmy Kelly's.

3515
02:35:10,420 --> 02:35:12,570
You thinking about moving now?
I don't know.

3516
02:35:12,720 --> 02:35:14,430
That humidity got me.
It's hot.

3517
02:35:14,940 --> 02:35:16,260
It gets hot.
That's it guys.

3518
02:35:16,320 --> 02:35:17,940
That's it guys.
That's the.

3519
02:35:18,390 --> 02:35:23,390
That's the,
that's the one in Nashville itself is 

3520
02:35:23,390 --> 02:35:23,390
safe,
but

3521
02:35:23,390 --> 02:35:27,330
when I was there I was talking about how
you drive 50 miles in any direction and 

3522
02:35:27,330 --> 02:35:30,661
you're in a Zombie movie and really it's
what it's like when you're driving 

3523
02:35:30,661 --> 02:35:33,280
through the dark areas of Tennessee.
Like he can get through some weird

3524
02:35:33,810 --> 02:35:38,810
motherfuckers don't know dark.
I love what you athletic athletic.

3525
02:35:39,741 --> 02:35:44,741
That's my says,
but I went to a spot where my in laws 

3526
02:35:44,751 --> 02:35:46,390
are from Myelin and all that.
What Mike?

3527
02:35:47,570 --> 02:35:50,880
He's from Trenton and all that shit.
Motherfuckers don't know nothing.

3528
02:35:51,170 --> 02:35:53,480
You know what nighttime is?
Yeah.

3529
02:35:53,660 --> 02:35:56,810
You have no idea.
Gentlemen outside the door and I saw the

3530
02:35:56,811 --> 02:36:01,811
wolves.
They just drew wolves everywhere to get 

3531
02:36:01,811 --> 02:36:04,121
the deer population down,
but they kill them something else now 

3532
02:36:04,121 --> 02:36:04,550
and every night and my inlaws got the 
dog.

3533
02:36:04,551 --> 02:36:05,870
I tightened the fucking balcony.
I'm like,

3534
02:36:05,871 --> 02:36:08,920
what the fuck?
And there's not one was yellow ones.

3535
02:36:09,820 --> 02:36:11,180
I always,
I think they did.

3536
02:36:11,210 --> 02:36:13,690
They brought them in to keep the deer 
population populations not.

3537
02:36:13,691 --> 02:36:16,880
I mean that fucking amazing.
So monsters to eat the food.

3538
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:21,940
This is what I'm saying.
So now that you know they killed 

3539
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:21,940
something else,
now all they were killing the rabbits.

3540
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:22,730
Oh God.
Did we kill him?

3541
02:36:22,731 --> 02:36:25,880
The fucking rabbits.
So one night you could hear my dad.

3542
02:36:25,910 --> 02:36:30,290
I'm 50 yards them.
That's so crazy.

3543
02:36:30,470 --> 02:36:32,270
Fucking crazy.
Fucking crazy.

3544
02:36:32,271 --> 02:36:35,210
So that was wild.
I liked that style of living.

3545
02:36:35,211 --> 02:36:37,490
But man,
let me tell you something.

3546
02:36:38,610 --> 02:36:40,990
Listen to me,
tell you something.

3547
02:36:41,090 --> 02:36:44,540
My friends to know that like I wanted a 
cup of coffee one night.

3548
02:36:45,350 --> 02:36:50,350
I didn't want to bother nobody because 
this time I usually stay at a hotel but 

3549
02:36:50,350 --> 02:36:52,640
it's too far.
It's too fucking far from the house.

3550
02:36:53,240 --> 02:36:56,240
I mean they're out there.
Joe Out there,

3551
02:36:56,440 --> 02:36:58,790
right?
Just beautiful land is paid for.

3552
02:36:59,030 --> 02:37:01,970
Gorgeous.
But they're out there like that.

3553
02:37:01,990 --> 02:37:02,780
I was like,
Terry,

3554
02:37:03,260 --> 02:37:04,370
I'm thinking this place.
She goes,

3555
02:37:04,520 --> 02:37:06,200
you know,
you get a cup of coffee,

3556
02:37:06,710 --> 02:37:10,780
it's 40 minutes each way,
like 30 or something.

3557
02:37:10,940 --> 02:37:12,770
Thirty minutes and you but you don't 
know where you're going.

3558
02:37:13,370 --> 02:37:15,680
So it's going to be 45.
Here's question.

3559
02:37:15,710 --> 02:37:15,980
What's

3560
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:20,980
more healthy that or New York because I 
don't know because sometimes sometimes I

3561
02:37:22,551 --> 02:37:27,551
think New York is more healthy,
but in being there just for over a 

3562
02:37:27,551 --> 02:37:31,930
couple of days and comparing the pace of
certain places that I've been to like 

3563
02:37:31,930 --> 02:37:34,991
boulder and then comparing it to New 
York and dealing with the people and I 

3564
02:37:34,991 --> 02:37:35,150
don't think,
I don't.

3565
02:37:35,151 --> 02:37:37,730
I can't say it's like New York people 
are shitty people,

3566
02:37:37,850 --> 02:37:38,160
you know,
it's,

3567
02:37:38,161 --> 02:37:42,590
it's not at the percentage of the people
that I ran into was very,

3568
02:37:42,591 --> 02:37:44,720
very small that,
that were not nice,

3569
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:47,660
but those you might not ever run into in
boulder.

3570
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:52,720
You know what I'm saying?
It's that the possibility of like 

3571
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:55,280
rudeness was there in a way that isn't 
in other spots.

3572
02:37:55,460 --> 02:37:56,270
So I gotta think about,
well,

3573
02:37:56,271 --> 02:37:57,770
why are people like that?
Like what is it?

3574
02:37:57,771 --> 02:37:59,270
What is it that causes people to be 
rude?

3575
02:37:59,271 --> 02:38:01,400
Is it just,
there's too many of us?

3576
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:02,240
What?
What is it?

3577
02:38:02,450 --> 02:38:04,370
I think that's part of it.
I really do.

3578
02:38:04,371 --> 02:38:09,371
I think there's a certain number of 
people when you get stuck in a certain 

3579
02:38:09,371 --> 02:38:10,490
amount of traffic and a certain amount 
of lines and certain mental waiting,

3580
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:12,410
a certain amount of frustration is not 
worth it.

3581
02:38:12,580 --> 02:38:14,030
Everybody,
everybody just

3582
02:38:14,610 --> 02:38:19,610
right now at one time or another,
the voices got loud with somebody at 

3583
02:38:19,991 --> 02:38:20,980
some point.
Oh yeah.

3584
02:38:21,270 --> 02:38:26,270
Yeah.
That's the answer to why people are 

3585
02:38:26,270 --> 02:38:27,670
rude.
The problem with us as we call it in New

3586
02:38:27,670 --> 02:38:29,140
York,
there's just so much.

3587
02:38:29,410 --> 02:38:32,390
I still have it.
I still have that time,

3588
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:35,740
so I have.
I grew up in that mentality in me.

3589
02:38:35,741 --> 02:38:36,730
It's Lubbock.
I am.

3590
02:38:37,060 --> 02:38:39,970
I get it,
but I don't get it all the time.

3591
02:38:39,971 --> 02:38:43,150
I don't get somebody being mean to you 
have the fucking belt.

3592
02:38:43,930 --> 02:38:45,580
There's a difference between route.
In fact,

3593
02:38:45,940 --> 02:38:47,650
there's some rootedness that you 
appreciate.

3594
02:38:48,100 --> 02:38:50,230
You're like,
thank fucking God.

3595
02:38:50,231 --> 02:38:53,530
We've got more people like that around 
to make this lady push a little bit.

3596
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:58,920
You know what I'm saying?
But that there's another type that 

3597
02:38:58,920 --> 02:39:01,351
rudeness I can't live with at this point
in my life and when I was younger I 

3598
02:39:01,351 --> 02:39:04,240
confronted with confront it.
Now I don't confront them anymore,

3599
02:39:04,310 --> 02:39:06,200
but then on the other hand,
he got around New York.

3600
02:39:06,201 --> 02:39:08,390
People are more street smart.
They just are.

3601
02:39:08,690 --> 02:39:11,390
There's people that are hipper.
They they like,

3602
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:14,810
like they just seem to be more on top of
things,

3603
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:17,840
you know,
the less obsessed with Hollywood.

3604
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:20,900
I think that's a really bad thing about 
the area we live in.

3605
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:21,700
Well,
that's good.

3606
02:39:21,701 --> 02:39:26,701
Worse.
That's what I ripped the worst over and 

3607
02:39:26,701 --> 02:39:27,340
over and over again.
That in this area,

3608
02:39:27,341 --> 02:39:28,420
particularly with.
Listen,

3609
02:39:28,750 --> 02:39:30,900
this is very funny because I didn't 
think about this.

3610
02:39:30,940 --> 02:39:33,910
I was onstage.
I dare you Brian.

3611
02:39:34,090 --> 02:39:39,040
I dare you to get a fucking parking 
ticket and be 45 minutes late to court.

3612
02:39:40,110 --> 02:39:45,110
I,
Danny motherfuckers to be late to court 

3613
02:39:45,110 --> 02:39:45,250
and Steve,
you don't get a bench warrant issued and

3614
02:39:45,251 --> 02:39:47,350
when you get there you have to Redo all 
the paperwork.

3615
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:52,620
Why this?
Lindsay Lohan always an hour late for 

3616
02:39:52,620 --> 02:39:52,620
court.
This cute.

3617
02:39:52,620 --> 02:39:57,330
You know Michael Jackson showed up in 
pajamas an our late for court as well,

3618
02:39:58,180 --> 02:40:00,670
and they try to be strict like Michael,
you know,

3619
02:40:00,671 --> 02:40:03,960
you're 46 minutes late for court.
Come with this fucking fact,

3620
02:40:04,020 --> 02:40:08,080
Cuban to court late one time and see 
what happens after a half hour there.

3621
02:40:08,090 --> 02:40:11,560
Strategies to it.
Let's pretend you got a parking ticket,

3622
02:40:11,590 --> 02:40:16,590
a speeding ticket,
and you know the cop a lot of times is 

3623
02:40:16,590 --> 02:40:17,190
the best strategy that my attorney in 
Jersey would do.

3624
02:40:17,490 --> 02:40:22,490
He would always say,
tell the copy I show up and then he 

3625
02:40:22,490 --> 02:40:25,311
would call and go Rogan's running late,
but he would tell the court clerks or 

3626
02:40:25,311 --> 02:40:29,061
we'll never get to the judge so the 
judge would issue a bench warrant fleet 

3627
02:40:29,061 --> 02:40:29,400
and we wait for the cop to leave the 
building.

3628
02:40:29,410 --> 02:40:31,710
Then we sneak around the back and we 
just say,

3629
02:40:31,711 --> 02:40:34,110
you got caught in traffic.
They Redo your bench warrant.

3630
02:40:34,111 --> 02:40:36,000
There's no to testify in a speeding 
ticket.

3631
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:37,650
And they dropped the charges with the 
ticket.

3632
02:40:37,790 --> 02:40:39,540
That's old school.
That's uncle Joe.

3633
02:40:39,541 --> 02:40:41,610
He dropping knowledge on a motherfucker 
right there,

3634
02:40:41,970 --> 02:40:45,420
but there's other situations where you 
don't want to be late for court,

3635
02:40:45,630 --> 02:40:49,640
especially if you go for Rehab or 
Michael Jackson molest butting heads.

3636
02:40:50,070 --> 02:40:52,250
That's why right now that that tells you
right there.

3637
02:40:52,251 --> 02:40:54,800
I've been to court before.
I day even bolder,

3638
02:40:54,830 --> 02:40:57,600
the nicest people in the world.
Get the court 10 minutes late.

3639
02:40:57,990 --> 02:40:59,280
They'll even let you in the fucking 
door.

3640
02:40:59,460 --> 02:41:01,920
Once they close that door in boulder,
sorry,

3641
02:41:01,980 --> 02:41:06,980
go to the third floor.
That means they handcuff you and go 

3642
02:41:06,980 --> 02:41:06,980
through the whole fucking thing all over
again.

3643
02:41:06,980 --> 02:41:11,590
It's like the idea that you can come to 
a place and this is the place to go.

3644
02:41:12,340 --> 02:41:17,340
If you want to get famous,
this is the place and the whole like 

3645
02:41:17,340 --> 02:41:20,050
entertainment industry,
so this is like the main hub of it.

3646
02:41:20,500 --> 02:41:23,870
You're going to get a lot of cool people
to look cool.

3647
02:41:23,950 --> 02:41:28,950
People that we know that all live here.
Look at how many friends we have that 

3648
02:41:28,950 --> 02:41:29,350
all live here.
You've got a lot of God damn cool people

3649
02:41:29,351 --> 02:41:34,351
till you get people that have gotten 
through the whole thing and sort of 

3650
02:41:34,351 --> 02:41:37,180
figured it out and relaxed and settled 
in and then you know,

3651
02:41:37,350 --> 02:41:39,520
became a.
understood how to,

3652
02:41:39,550 --> 02:41:41,620
how to,
how to work within the parameters of the

3653
02:41:41,621 --> 02:41:46,621
business without getting caught up in it
and becoming one of those weird last 

3654
02:41:46,621 --> 02:41:47,680
Hollywood type people.

3655
02:41:47,770 --> 02:41:50,520
This is my beef and I think it's true of
before,

3656
02:41:50,521 --> 02:41:55,521
so two and a red band doesn't look at it
this way and this and I've always 

3657
02:41:55,521 --> 02:41:57,610
thought about because I'm 50,
but uh,

3658
02:41:57,611 --> 02:42:00,310
I go for auditions,
which you don't,

3659
02:42:00,470 --> 02:42:05,380
and I see a little bit more of this 
bullshit and I once saw girls,

3660
02:42:05,860 --> 02:42:10,860
maybe six years old that were adorable.
I walked into a room this big that was 

3661
02:42:10,901 --> 02:42:15,901
packed,
but these two little girls that was six 

3662
02:42:15,901 --> 02:42:18,850
decide that they're going to take 20 of 
the head shots and put them all over the

3663
02:42:18,851 --> 02:42:21,490
floor.
Okay.

3664
02:42:21,970 --> 02:42:24,100
And I heard the one girl say some 
tailored girls.

3665
02:42:24,101 --> 02:42:29,101
You got to move this one little girl 
said my daddy's a director or something 

3666
02:42:29,101 --> 02:42:29,101
like that.
Okay.

3667
02:42:29,101 --> 02:42:30,970
So this is my problem guys.
Me,

3668
02:42:30,971 --> 02:42:32,560
I'm a piece of shit.
I'll live anywhere.

3669
02:42:33,340 --> 02:42:35,470
Really want to raise a child here,
you know?

3670
02:42:35,471 --> 02:42:36,580
Uh,
I don't want.

3671
02:42:37,360 --> 02:42:42,360
This is probably the values of life here
are judged differently than what they 

3672
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:43,120
are in Chicago,
Boston.

3673
02:42:43,320 --> 02:42:46,210
And you might look down on that.
Some people might look down on that,

3674
02:42:46,211 --> 02:42:48,430
but I don't,
I never don't.

3675
02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:51,820
I don't know.
I think for us there's like,

3676
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:53,050
first of all,

3677
02:42:54,210 --> 02:42:59,210
this is the only place where there's 
like such a conglomeration of those 

3678
02:42:59,210 --> 02:43:00,990
people,
so it's like if you live your whole life

3679
02:43:00,991 --> 02:43:03,330
and you never come in contact with them,
you know,

3680
02:43:03,331 --> 02:43:08,331
this is,
it can be kind of shocking when you're 

3681
02:43:08,331 --> 02:43:08,331
around like a bunch of actors are a 
bunch of Hollywood types,

3682
02:43:08,331 --> 02:43:12,201
but the one of the real problem is 
there's not any other that's looked at 

3683
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:15,700
like that prominently here.
That's so overwhelming.

3684
02:43:15,701 --> 02:43:20,701
There's so many people that are involved
in it that kids like automatically sort 

3685
02:43:20,701 --> 02:43:22,660
of gravitate towards it.
They like everybody wants to be famous,

3686
02:43:22,661 --> 02:43:24,550
they'll gravitate towards it.
Whereas in Denver,

3687
02:43:24,551 --> 02:43:26,350
who the fuck is going to be famous?
So you want to be famous.

3688
02:43:26,550 --> 02:43:28,720
That's a real God damn pipe dream.
If you live in Boston,

3689
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:30,550
you know it's a real God damn pipe 
dream.

3690
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:33,250
But if you live in Hollywood,
it seems like it's attainable.

3691
02:43:33,400 --> 02:43:38,400
Oh my God.
We saw this guy at the mall and then we 

3692
02:43:38,400 --> 02:43:40,771
were there.
We saw this and we went to an audition 

3693
02:43:40,771 --> 02:43:40,771
and I saw Ben Affleck.
Oh,

3694
02:43:40,771 --> 02:43:40,771
you know,
just becomes,

3695
02:43:40,771 --> 02:43:43,960
it comes more of a focal point and 
there's not enough other shit here.

3696
02:43:43,970 --> 02:43:45,140
Let me ask you something.
How come?

3697
02:43:45,590 --> 02:43:49,610
Have you ever seen any pictures of Joe 
Rogan hate dude,

3698
02:43:50,390 --> 02:43:51,440
never.
I'll tell you later.

3699
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:52,620
Oh No,
no,

3700
02:43:52,640 --> 02:43:54,140
no.
I'm just saying why?

3701
02:43:54,560 --> 02:43:59,560
Because Joe does pop razzi pages.
Well suddenly that I don't do all that 

3702
02:43:59,560 --> 02:43:59,560
shit.
No,

3703
02:43:59,560 --> 02:44:00,070
I understand.
I don't like to go to parties.

3704
02:44:00,130 --> 02:44:00,350
No,
no,

3705
02:44:00,390 --> 02:44:05,390
no.
I'm just saying even anywhere you 

3706
02:44:05,390 --> 02:44:05,390
listen.
If you go to Laurel Canyon,

3707
02:44:05,390 --> 02:44:08,070
farmer's market with your family now on 
Sunday varieties,

3708
02:44:08,200 --> 02:44:09,010
that 10,
15.

3709
02:44:09,260 --> 02:44:10,310
Yeah.
Okay.

3710
02:44:10,400 --> 02:44:11,780
I'm calling you right now because I've 
seen him.

3711
02:44:11,810 --> 02:44:13,820
I encountered a bunch of New York.
I'm not A.

3712
02:44:13,880 --> 02:44:16,200
I'm not saying nothing bad about pop 
rocks.

3713
02:44:16,201 --> 02:44:17,510
He's like,
I'm just making a point.

3714
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:21,380
If you want people taking pictures,
you people take motherfucking busy.

3715
02:44:21,860 --> 02:44:23,430
If you don't want to,
you don't want that.

3716
02:44:23,440 --> 02:44:25,700
People will not bother you.
Don't bother you.

3717
02:44:25,701 --> 02:44:28,210
People don't bother Adam Carolla the 
people that are in the,

3718
02:44:28,310 --> 02:44:30,680
in the,
in the limelight want to be in the land.

3719
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:32,630
Well,
there's a lot of folks that do things on

3720
02:44:32,631 --> 02:44:35,810
purpose for sure.
Just the other night that was.

3721
02:44:36,350 --> 02:44:37,670
I was talking to my friend the other day
who,

3722
02:44:37,671 --> 02:44:39,200
he's a popper I'd see,
and he's like,

3723
02:44:39,320 --> 02:44:41,380
uh,
you want to go to the lax tonight?

3724
02:44:41,410 --> 02:44:42,560
I'm like,
why are you guys well here?

3725
02:44:42,561 --> 02:44:46,850
I got Lindsay Logan's boarding pass.
She's flying in at 5:30

3726
02:44:46,850 --> 02:44:46,850
AM.

3727
02:44:47,070 --> 02:44:47,560
I'm like,
what?

3728
02:44:47,670 --> 02:44:51,940
Oh fuck.
I've watched the other day or read it.

3729
02:44:51,990 --> 02:44:56,990
I read it online about Jamie Presley.
Did you guys read that story about her 

3730
02:44:57,361 --> 02:45:00,630
getting into a beef in Hollywood?
Because the chick stole.

3731
02:45:00,960 --> 02:45:03,240
This is hysterical.
So her assistant,

3732
02:45:03,630 --> 02:45:06,840
somebody stole her assistance purse,
right?

3733
02:45:06,970 --> 02:45:08,290
The jewelry you heard about?
No,

3734
02:45:08,910 --> 02:45:12,060
she went to Hollywood to get the 
assistance purse back.

3735
02:45:12,300 --> 02:45:15,740
But the girl that had something in the 
purse that lets you know that the pro,

3736
02:45:15,770 --> 02:45:20,770
you like a gps.
The GPS on the phone was in the purse 

3737
02:45:20,770 --> 02:45:24,050
and they figured out it was pointed to 
this bar where they're having the 

3738
02:45:24,050 --> 02:45:25,110
celebrity stuff out.
So Jamie Presley showed up and yelled at

3739
02:45:25,111 --> 02:45:30,111
the girl,
but then it turned out that in that 

3740
02:45:30,111 --> 02:45:30,111
purse with drugs,
I don't know.

3741
02:45:30,111 --> 02:45:31,890
So the cops showed up and then nobody 
knows who the person was.

3742
02:45:31,891 --> 02:45:33,220
Like once they got there,
like,

3743
02:45:33,370 --> 02:45:34,260
no,
that ain't my bro.

3744
02:45:34,270 --> 02:45:39,270
You guys were just.
They got into a fight over the fucking 

3745
02:45:39,270 --> 02:45:39,270
purse.
But once the cops got there,

3746
02:45:39,270 --> 02:45:44,070
they opened.
The person was like blow and steroids 

3747
02:45:44,070 --> 02:45:44,070
in.
There is some shit like that.

3748
02:45:44,070 --> 02:45:45,970
Ain't no motherfucking person no more.
Ain't no fuck.

3749
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:46,990
We don't even know what.

3750
02:45:50,460 --> 02:45:53,370
It's always a pleasure,
my friend.

3751
02:45:53,610 --> 02:45:54,390
Do you remember this?

3752
02:45:55,800 --> 02:45:58,080
You're mad TV on the Sopranos.

3753
02:45:58,260 --> 02:46:02,060
She told me every fucking show.
It's

3754
02:46:02,060 --> 02:46:02,900
funny.
You just pull it up.

3755
02:46:02,901 --> 02:46:05,390
I saw James Gandolfini walking around in
New York.

3756
02:46:05,720 --> 02:46:07,160
How big is he?
A big guy.

3757
02:46:07,220 --> 02:46:08,900
Big Guy.
I saw him in that movie.

3758
02:46:09,170 --> 02:46:14,170
Them softly.
It's actually pretty fucking good movie 

3759
02:46:14,170 --> 02:46:14,170
man.
Isn't a good movie.

3760
02:46:14,170 --> 02:46:14,960
That's pretty fucking good movie.
I knew anything Brad Pitt,

3761
02:46:14,961 --> 02:46:16,800
but to other solid.
They killed that.

3762
02:46:16,801 --> 02:46:18,260
Fuck that.
I don't know why they killed it.

3763
02:46:18,290 --> 02:46:20,030
I enjoy that movie.
It was a good movie.

3764
02:46:20,340 --> 02:46:22,980
It was one of those under the radar.
Brad Pitt's a bad motherfucker.

3765
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:25,550
Kendall feeney is a killer.
He's a killer.

3766
02:46:25,730 --> 02:46:28,310
I don't know if he's know what happens 
in this country every day at 5:00

3767
02:46:28,311 --> 02:46:33,311
now what happens at 5:00,
they started the sopranos from scratch 

3768
02:46:33,311 --> 02:46:38,240
at Hbo.
They brought them back because it was 

3769
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:39,560
just too overwhelming.
Hbo took them back from a and e and they

3770
02:46:39,561 --> 02:46:44,561
said it's all going to play him every 
day and there are doing season one 

3771
02:46:44,561 --> 02:46:45,280
watching them my and there was torture.
Torturous,

3772
02:46:45,590 --> 02:46:48,570
but not all the swears and all the bad 
shit.

3773
02:46:49,090 --> 02:46:51,830
That Wasi episode,
the third episode of season,

3774
02:46:51,831 --> 02:46:54,080
when they take the power back,
when Jackie dies,

3775
02:46:54,350 --> 02:46:59,350
they go down.
That is one of the best written show of 

3776
02:46:59,350 --> 02:47:00,640
off and gather.
The feeney was very.

3777
02:47:00,770 --> 02:47:05,250
I forgot how good he really was.
Everybody else was sub par.

3778
02:47:05,270 --> 02:47:07,040
He was,
he's amazing.

3779
02:47:07,190 --> 02:47:10,220
He fucking,
he plays a total psycho and it's killing

3780
02:47:10,221 --> 02:47:12,320
them softly and it's so fucking 
unbelievable.

3781
02:47:12,650 --> 02:47:14,210
It's so believable.
Oh,

3782
02:47:14,270 --> 02:47:14,810
that's great.

3783
02:47:15,140 --> 02:47:17,240
They seen a period for that guy that did
district nine,

3784
02:47:17,250 --> 02:47:19,140
his next movie with Matt Damon in it.

3785
02:47:19,940 --> 02:47:20,570
Um,
no,

3786
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:23,380
it's fucking amazing.
Uh,

3787
02:47:23,950 --> 02:47:27,060
you remember the name was it?
Yeah,

3788
02:47:27,061 --> 02:47:32,061
but it's takes place like 100 years in 
the future in the trailer is so bad ass.

3789
02:47:32,190 --> 02:47:33,900
It looks amazing.

3790
02:47:34,120 --> 02:47:34,860
Well,
um,

3791
02:47:34,870 --> 02:47:38,700
I was in New York this past weekend for 
the upfronts,

3792
02:47:38,710 --> 02:47:43,710
for Scifi,
for this new show that I'm doing that I 

3793
02:47:43,710 --> 02:47:43,710
can now talk about that I don't get in 
trouble called Joe Rogan questions,

3794
02:47:43,710 --> 02:47:48,271
everything.
But they got this new show called 

3795
02:47:48,271 --> 02:47:51,001
defiance that's coming out.
That's a combination video game and 

3796
02:47:51,001 --> 02:47:51,370
science fiction show.
Dude,

3797
02:47:51,371 --> 02:47:53,400
it looks insane.
It's this,

3798
02:47:53,430 --> 02:47:54,880
it's a huge,
huge,

3799
02:47:54,881 --> 02:47:58,060
huge project that the Scifi channel is 
an undertaking.

3800
02:47:58,330 --> 02:48:03,330
And the SCIFI channel,
we're battlestar Galactica came from I 

3801
02:48:03,330 --> 02:48:03,330
think so.
Was that the,

3802
02:48:03,330 --> 02:48:08,160
did they do Battlestar Galactica?
Battlestar Galactica was one of my 

3803
02:48:08,160 --> 02:48:09,340
favorite fucking shows ever that,
that remake Battlestar Galactica.

3804
02:48:09,341 --> 02:48:13,570
It took till season two for Brian to 
convince me that I should check it out.

3805
02:48:14,190 --> 02:48:16,750
It's fucking tremendous.
Twice,

3806
02:48:16,770 --> 02:48:18,550
like 54.
What is it?

3807
02:48:18,830 --> 02:48:23,830
This is that new movie.
It's caught and it has matt Damon in it.

3808
02:48:25,160 --> 02:48:27,380
And just look at that though.
Look at that right there.

3809
02:48:27,381 --> 02:48:28,730
That's fucking beautiful.

3810
02:48:31,700 --> 02:48:36,700

3812
02:48:36,700 --> 02:48:38,460
like it's supposed to be a 21,
54,

3813
02:48:38,461 --> 02:48:43,461
I think like really long in the future.
And it's like Matt Damon's all buffing 

3814
02:48:44,391 --> 02:48:45,210
it and said,

humbling place,

3826
02:49:16,110 --> 02:49:19,380

02:49:59,370 --> 02:50:02,160
That looks pretty dope,

3841
02:50:02,870 --> 02:50:07,870

They're trying to find out where the 
weed is.

3908
02:52:41,560 --> 02:52:43,620
Once we will become legal,
they have nothing to talk about us for.

3909
02:52:43,630 --> 02:52:45,190
We're not really looking overthrow
