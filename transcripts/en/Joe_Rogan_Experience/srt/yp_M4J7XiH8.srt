00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello Freak bitches,
and I was like,

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:06,720
well,
what is this whole fitness connection to

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:08,550
hunting?
Like why do they need to be in shape?

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,930
I'm like,
I'm in pretty good shape.

5
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:11,190
Like what's the big deal?
Well,

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,290
I went with Rinella and when I went with
one of the things I realized that point,

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,230
I got pretty winded going up these
fucking hills,

8
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,460
hiking,
hiking,

9
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,294
tires,
you out,

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,560
especially high altitude and then I see
your videos online and I was like,

11
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,570
what the fuck is this guy into?
And then as I go deeper and deeper into

12
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:28,350
it,
I realized,

13
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,950
oh,
this is like an extreme pursuit.

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,500
This is not just something just go out
and do.

15
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,720
This is something that's really hard to
do.

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,530
And a lot of people there,
I've,

17
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,440
I've,
I've read this one article,

18
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:43,170
but there's one guy who was unsuccessful
12 years in a row,

19
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:44,480
elk hunting for it.

20
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,470
Finally shot an elk like 12 years.
Like how many times did this guy go out?

21
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:51,090
How many days did he camped in the
forest?

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,590
How many days did he try to stock and
get winded or snap on a twig?

23
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,420
At the last minute or you know,
the,

24
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:01,440
the elk season and bolts it.
Most people are unsuccessful.

25
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,750
Yeah.
I mean nine out of 10 every year.

26
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,160
Unsuccessful.
I think it's more than that for elk

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,620
hunting.
With archery it,

28
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,240
it's about,
it's about 10 percent.

29
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,270
Is it 10 percent?
Yeah.

30
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,410
So nine out of 10 are unsuccessful.
So people who don't hunt who see dead

31
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,030
stuff all the time,
they think,

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,290
oh,
you just go out and kill an Adam,

33
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,230
right?
No,

34
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,980
right.
Most 90 percent don't.

35
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,140
It is really hard and it's just like
until you're out there,

36
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,800
you got the bone in your hand and you're
trying to close in on that animal and

37
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,980
you're trying to do everything right
from a to z with.

38
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,580
And there's so many variables during
that whole path is just like,

39
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,270
it seems impossible sometimes,
you know,

40
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,360
even even for me after 30 years.
So in a sense,

41
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:48,930
psychologically when you talk about
postmodernists and their rejection of

42
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:53,040
these classic male structures are,
what they doing is realizing that

43
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:57,630
they're not going to compete in the
classic as stated male hierarchy.

44
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,790
So they're creating their own version of
it.

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,840
Sure.
That's the creative element.

46
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:02,720
Sure.
While we,

47
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,080
he,
we asked earlier,

48
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:07,320
what's the motivation of these
pathological guys who are out there like

49
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,840
bolstering up the feminists?
Yeah.

50
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,220
Well,
you know,

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,710
they don't compete any other way.
They don't compete.

52
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,350
They figured out how to compete.
They compete as allies.

53
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:19,170
Let's say.
[inaudible] very sneaky.

54
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

55
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,800
And that's how everybody always
describes them to when you.

56
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:27,410
I mean it's almost like a,
we,

57
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,010
I avoid doing it because it just almost
feels gross to label them like that,

58
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:34,380
but that's,
that is the way you think of male

59
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,210
feminists.
You think of them as sneaky

60
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,220
and it's creepy and discriminated
discriminatory towards classic male

61
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:44,940
behavior.
Well,

62
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:47,250
it,
no wonder they haven't got a hope of

63
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,400
competing in that hierarchy.
Wow,

64
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,860
that's deep.
That is deep.

65
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,060
This is going to be hurtful to a lot of
people.

66
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,680
So a lot of people listening to this
right now,

67
00:02:58,681 --> 00:02:59,514
very upset.

68
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,850
You asked earlier why,
why the postmodernists don't like blunt

69
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,070
speech.
That's why man,

70
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,950
you know,
it's like the truth is something that

71
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,490
Burns,
it burns off deadwood and people don't

72
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:15,940
like having their dead wood burn it off
often because they're like 95 percent

73
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,730
deadwood and I'm not being an.
Believe me,

74
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,820
I'm not being snide about that.
It's no joke.

75
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,930
When you start to realize how much of
what you've constructed of yourself is

76
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,820
based on deception and lies,
that is a horrifying realization and it

77
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:33,700
can easily be 95 percent of you.
Your things.

78
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:37,810
You say things you act out,
you know it's well,

79
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
you see that in Pinocchio,
which I often you discuss,

80
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,580
you know Pinocchio,
when he gets corrupt,

81
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:43,870
as he,
as he matures,

82
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,580
he first learns to lie and then he
becomes a brain jackass on pleasure

83
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:49,720
island.
It's like,

84
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,630
and he's threatened by the underground
authoritarians,

85
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:52,810
right?

86
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,250
They're going to sell them to the salt
mines.

87
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,084
It's like,
yeah,

88
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,670
that's for sure.
It's exactly right man.

89
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,810
So then you figure out your uh,
brain jackass and you're lying all the

90
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,520
time.
That's a terrible realization.

91
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,670
And then all that needs to be burned
away and no,

92
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:10,350
people don't like that.
It ties into lake a misconception,

93
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:12,310
is that a natural,
like a funny thing,

94
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:14,050
like when I worked in the video game
industry,

95
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,470
there's a platform games,
you jim from little platforms and seven

96
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,900
times the EPA light platforms that move
around and Mario type things in some

97
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:25,600
video games,
when you jump up on a moving platform

98
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,240
and then jump down and fall down,
you will fall down because platform

99
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,550
moves out from underneath you.
Sometimes you jump up and you move with

100
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:36,610
the platform and you land on.
It depends on what the program did right

101
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,880
now a friend of mine was doing a video
game and one of the programs that said,

102
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,140
Oh,
if you jump up and then jump down,

103
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,910
the platform should have moved out from
underneath you.

104
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,330
So you should be able to like a,
you should be able to,

105
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,423
uh,
you know,

106
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,150
this is the way we should program the
physics.

107
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,710
And then my friend Matt said,
no,

108
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,310
that's wrong.
And he couldn't convince this other guy.

109
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,990
So eventually what happened?
He says,

110
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:00,700
right.
What we're gonna do is we're going to go

111
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,910
out onto the road with my pickup,
my pickup truck,

112
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,910
I'm going to get in the back and you're
going to drive along at 30 miles an hour

113
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,650
and I'm going to jump straight up in the
air and we'll get to see whether I land

114
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:15,460
in the truck or a land on the road.
So they did this experiment and the guy,

115
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,370
the other guy who was driving the truck
was totally expecting him to late jump

116
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:20,800
up in that full out of the back of the
truck because the truck went moved dog

117
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,490
because he's moving the same speed as
the trucks may jumps up and then he

118
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,250
lands back in the truck and this that.

119
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,150
This is illustrating the video game
program.

120
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,970
I had the exact same misconception that
the flat earth is due because they say,

121
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,470
well,
what if the earth is moving so fast?

122
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:36,960
Why can't you just go up in a
helicopter,

123
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,400
hover a bit,
wait for the Earth to move underneath

124
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:40,900
you?
Then go back down again.

125
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,360
It's just,
you know,

126
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:45,220
it's completely backwards physics
because you already moving,

127
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,520
so you'd have to slow down to zero a
which is the same as speeding up and

128
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:54,250
relatively speaking.
So the point is that anyone can make

129
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,390
misconceptions about physics like that.
Yeah.

130
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,550
And it's easy to get sucked into that
and it's actually quite hard to break

131
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,590
them even flow.
This is reasonable guy who was like,

132
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:04,500
you know,
video game program,

133
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:06,740
but who presumably knew something about
physics.

134
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,090
He was convinced that Matt was going to
fall out to the back of the truck and

135
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,890
quite possibly die,
but they still let him do the

136
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:13,370
experiment.
