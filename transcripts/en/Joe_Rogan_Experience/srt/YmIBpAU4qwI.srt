1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,820
Hello Freak bitches ran a park.

2
00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:04,654
Ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,710
Good to see you brother.

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,341
Good to see you,

5
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:06,551
man.

6
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:07,450
Thanks for coming on here.

7
00:00:07,451 --> 00:00:08,284
I appreciate it.

8
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,990
You are in the middle of the,

9
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,690
one of the most controversial
movies in the history of the world.

10
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,050
Yeah.

11
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:14,560
Yeah.

12
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,071
You are.

13
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:15,850
You play,

14
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,870
I play Kim Jong.

15
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,350
Yeah.

16
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,190
In the interview,

17
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,840
which is fucking crazy,

18
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:20,674
man.

19
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,250
I think it was crazy when I signed on,

20
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,680
I realized it was crazy.

21
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,880
You know,

22
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,140
in the midst of all that.

23
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,520
Yeah.

24
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,840
What is the verdict?

25
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,610
Because they say that it's not,

26
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,140
it's not North Korea.

27
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:34,970
Someone was saying it
was an insider at Sony.

28
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,983
They had it.

29
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,530
They had it narrowed down
to a woman who hacked it.

30
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,493
Read that,

31
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:40,981
you know,

32
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:41,760
I don't know.

33
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,301
I don't know.

34
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:43,650
Cause after they came out with that,

35
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,270
the FBI came out and said,

36
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,661
no,

37
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:46,920
it is North Korea.

38
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,770
We have a lot of information
that we haven't released,

39
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,680
but it is trust us.

40
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,603
But then,

41
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,031
you know,

42
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:54,301
the,

43
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:59,301
the private kind of security experts
still think it's not North Korea.

44
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,710
I would almost always go with private
security experts over the FBI.

45
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,700
Almost always.

46
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,110
I kind of feel like most
people now what also,

47
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,650
which is kind of sad,

48
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,330
you know,

49
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,410
sad for the FBI,

50
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:14,180
but I think most people
are questioning it.

51
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,640
Would you be willing
to go over there ever?

52
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,660
How well and yeah,

53
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,550
ever do you mean like do you
mean North Korea specifically?

54
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,810
Do you mean Oh yes,

55
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:25,700
very specific.

56
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,250
Well,

57
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,083
no,

58
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,260
not go over there.

59
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,630
I would never go there.

60
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Especially if you went over there
under the guidance of Dennis Rodman.

61
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,290
No,

62
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:36,690
no.

63
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,600
I would say I wouldn't
go near Dennis Rodman

64
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,421
in America.

65
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:43,470
I would not go near him,

66
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,680
but I would not go near
North Korea at all.

67
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:47,310
I mean,

68
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,310
if the regime topples changes and uh,

69
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,683
you know,

70
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,200
I don't know 20 years from now,

71
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,470
it's the likelihood of that though.

72
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,171
I don't know.

73
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:58,530
I don't,

74
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,130
I don't think it's,

75
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,000
I think it's possible,

76
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:01,740
but in our lifetimes I think.

77
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,150
But uh,

78
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:03,601
yeah,

79
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:04,890
that's the only way I'd go.

80
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,211
Well,

81
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:08,160
we were talking about this
before the podcast started.

82
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,290
The exchange flashdrives

83
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:10,930
yeah.

84
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,070
Back and forth to each other.

85
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,490
Yeah.

86
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,480
Like in the eye,

87
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:14,680
a huge part of

88
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,640
the underground economy there is,

89
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:21,430
is basically these flash drives with,

90
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,980
with South Korean TV shows,

91
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,821
movies,

92
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:25,960
American movies,

93
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:26,231
you know,

94
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:30,880
just glimpses into the outside world
that they're not supposed to see.

95
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:32,620
It's a huge underground market.

96
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,143
So I think,

97
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,350
I don't mean the people there,

98
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:37,990
especially the younger people
that they know what's going on,

99
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,530
you know?

100
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,610
And if they get caught,

101
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,440
not only they fucked.

102
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:41,881
Yeah.

103
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:42,760
A day if the,

104
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,100
well this is what I,

105
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:46,120
I've read and I don't know how it is now.

106
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:48,460
It might be even worse now for all I know.

107
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:48,791
But yeah,

108
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:53,140
if they get caught they
go to a labor camp for,

109
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:55,080
I don't know how long that,

110
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,190
it's like a three
generational thing there.

111
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,460
Their kids go to a labor there and their
parents will go like the hall family

112
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:05,500
ends up being punished for their action,

113
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,150
which is wild.

114
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,393
It's insane.

115
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,790
Yeah.

116
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,061
And when,

117
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:11,940
when we hear about like
dictatorships like that,

118
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,370
we always think of it that's from
like the forties like you know,

119
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:15,920
you think of it as he is,

120
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,550
it is from the forties that's a thing.

121
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:20,520
And it just has not changed over there.

122
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,330
Yeah.

123
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,420
I just wonder what it would take for
something like that to be toppled.

124
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,270
And we were also talking before the
podcast started about his uncle.

125
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,830
His uncle apparently was
planning some sort of a coup,

126
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:30,660
so yeah.

127
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,560
Killed his uncle.

128
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,760
Killed his uncle's sons.

129
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:33,210
Yeah.

130
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:33,601
Yeah.

131
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:33,991
I mean,

132
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:34,171
well,

133
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:35,490
one thing that happened when our,

134
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:39,420
when our movie was about to come
out there was like a some expert

135
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:39,801
on,

136
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:44,801
on North Korea who said
that it's important that the
elite in Pyongyang see this

137
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:46,140
movie,

138
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,590
especially the people in the,

139
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,051
the,

140
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:49,351
you know,

141
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:52,380
the government and it working
at it because it's so,

142
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,580
it's so they're on such shaky ground
right now that for them to see something

143
00:03:56,581 --> 00:04:01,581
like this could really help in getting
something to happen over there.

144
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,270
This is what Sony was saying.

145
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:03,511
No,

146
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:03,691
no.

147
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:04,291
This was like a,

148
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,140
an expert on it.

149
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,650
Like some professor or
something on North Korea,

150
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:08,970
which I thought was interesting.

151
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,130
But yeah,

152
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,993
I,

153
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,800
that kind of blew my
mind when he said that.

154
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,770
Wow,

155
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,251
that's great.

156
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:16,180
Imagine if it did.

157
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:17,470
Imagine if that was the catalyst.

158
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,920
If hours are ridiculous comedy,

159
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:20,770
Seth Rogan,

160
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:25,771
James Franco movie catalyst for
overthrowing the last great communist

161
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:27,934
dictatorship.

162
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,600
Yeah,

163
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,680
I mean it's cool.

164
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,850
Communist dictatorship.

165
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,941
That's crazy.

166
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:32,661
I mean it's all,

167
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:33,021
you know,

168
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:34,090
as so much of it is,

169
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:34,361
is,

170
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:37,460
is this kind of deification,

171
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:37,971
you know,

172
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:39,560
of him and,

173
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,423
uh,

174
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,810
all of this stuff,

175
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,081
you know,

176
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:42,681
our movie,

177
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:43,550
but not just that,

178
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,740
even just glimpses into the outside world.

179
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:47,420
It just chips away at that,

180
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:47,751
you know,

181
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:50,570
and he becomes who he is,

182
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:50,871
you know,

183
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:53,570
to these people and to
other people and you know,

184
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,860
in the government and,

185
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:55,101
and,

186
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:57,830
and that does not help their cause,

187
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:58,520
you know,

188
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,050
or the government or Kim Jong Un's cause

189
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:01,720
you know,

190
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,280
what is the Dennis Rodman thing?

191
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,970
Did you research him at
all when you did this?

192
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:07,791
I did,

193
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,181
yeah.

194
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:09,014
I mean,

195
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,880
Kim Jong Goon include an his father,

196
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,410
Kim Jong Il when he was alive.

197
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:16,970
Huge NBA fans.

198
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,430
He was a huge basketball fan.

199
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:22,430
He was like a loved Michael Jordan.

200
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,660
And there's a story of,

201
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:24,590
of Kim Jong goons.

202
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,600
Supposedly he was a,

203
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,780
when he was a student,

204
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,330
he went to like an international
school in Switzerland.

205
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,051
And,

206
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:30,291
uh,

207
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,560
there are accounts of
him from other students.

208
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:38,561
He just sit in class all day and draw
doodle pictures of Michael Jordan like

209
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:40,100
literally in this class.

210
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,420
So like he was obsessed with
basketball and in that era,

211
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,021
and I think,

212
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:45,650
you know,

213
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,470
that bowls team was
running things at the time,

214
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,960
like rotten just to,

215
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,560
he was a huge rod and fan.

216
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,330
Wow.

217
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:52,900
Yeah.

218
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,010
That's crazy.

219
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:54,870
That's so crazy.

220
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,950
See Rodney over there
hanging out with them as so.

221
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,160
So did you see that at
that press conference?

222
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,063
No,

223
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,570
there's a video of like a press conference
where he's basically sitting there

224
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:05,901
with the,

225
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:06,740
with the other play,

226
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,800
some other players who went with him
on this trip and he's clearly drunk

227
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,890
and he's basically justifying his,

228
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:16,724
you know,

229
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,580
his actions by going over there and,

230
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:19,430
and you know,

231
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,240
you come in friends with this guy and
he's like trunk and this is a press

232
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:25,010
conference from Korea or from America,

233
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,160
I think it was in Korea that
they shot that they've shot it.

234
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,820
And you could see the players behind him
and they just look super uncomfortable.

235
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,673
Bullshit

236
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,470
going around like,

237
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:34,651
well,

238
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:36,540
how could you not be super
uncomfortable first of all,

239
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,660
but hanging out with Dennis Rodman
and make you super uncomfortable.

240
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:39,990
Yeah.

241
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,240
Dennis Rodman calling a press conference.

242
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,940
That's bad,

243
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,580
dude.

244
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,121
No worries,

245
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:45,650
man.

246
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,650
We kicked things off,

247
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,071
Randall.

248
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:47,830
We're good.

249
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,230
It was just,

250
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,890
we had to cover the interview anyway.

251
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:52,650
We had to go over all the crazy
shit that he's been going through.

252
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,460
Yeah.

253
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,300
The artist formerly known as Kim Jong Un.

254
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,820
Did you at any point in
time feel like you fuck

255
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,570
dob now,

256
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:01,930
man,

257
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,763
you know?

258
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,723
No.

259
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,771
This is the thing.

260
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:08,700
I wasn't like scared for my life.

261
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,150
Right.

262
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,810
For your life.

263
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,630
This is the thing.

264
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,370
There were enough people like you,

265
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,361
friends,

266
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:14,194
family,

267
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,610
people who were genuinely scared for
my life that it got me thinking like,

268
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:20,470
should I be scared for my life?

269
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:20,651
Well,

270
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:21,790
you have secret service.

271
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,730
We had guards at the house.

272
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,750
Yeah.

273
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,200
Yeah.

274
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,960
Sony provided US guards long.

275
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,980
It's like a couple of weeks.

276
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:30,541
What the fuck,

277
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,160
Sony and at first at first I was like,

278
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,350
we don't need guards series,

279
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,460
so we don't need guards.

280
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:36,821
They're like,

281
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:37,420
let's listen.

282
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,150
Let us just give you some
guard just for peace of mind.

283
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:40,631
I was like,

284
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:41,250
all right,

285
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,083
all right.

286
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,611
And then,

287
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:43,230
uh,

288
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,160
Wa and then one day they were just gone.

289
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:46,450
Like a few weeks later they're gone.

290
00:07:46,451 --> 00:07:47,081
And I was thinking,

291
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:47,531
oh my God,

292
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:48,161
we're the guards.

293
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:49,090
I need the guards.

294
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,570
You know,

295
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:49,751
like,

296
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:50,680
I was just so,

297
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,571
you know,

298
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,750
I felt so protected by then when I
did it and it wouldn't have otherwise.

299
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:56,380
You know,

300
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,650
I just got you standing to my
friends being so concerned for me.

301
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,810
It just Kinda got me paranoid.

302
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,110
Yeah.

303
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,520
Did anyone contact you?

304
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,740
Did you get any threats
or did anybody know?

305
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,581
No one on Twitter,

306
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:08,740
like pretended to be from North
Korea and fucked with you?

307
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,620
We should have done a tool.

308
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,091
I,

309
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:12,481
you know,

310
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:14,520
I mean I would get like spam mail,

311
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:17,850
like I always get and I
would think twice of Ip.

312
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,211
Like,

313
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:19,050
wait a minute,

314
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,410
is this like regular spam
or is this like hacking?

315
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,710
So my email destroy my life spam,

316
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:25,960

317
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,191
Right,

318
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:26,461
right,

319
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:26,700
right.

320
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:26,941
And,

321
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:27,774
uh,

322
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,261
but I,

323
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:28,531
you know,

324
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:30,240
I didn't know I wouldn't ever have,

325
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,470
I just kind of deleted it.

326
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,333
Like I always do,

327
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:32,700
you know?

328
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,241
Yeah.

329
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:34,074
You're always uni.

330
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,370
I was paranoid.

331
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,120
Unrelated.

332
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,510
Yeah.

333
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:36,781
Yeah.

334
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:37,411
Most likely.

335
00:08:37,411 --> 00:08:37,661
But I,

336
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:37,861
I,

337
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:38,071
you know,

338
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,060
I got paranoid.

339
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,500
I got paranoid after awhile and then the
movie came out and like we were talking

340
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:44,041
about earlier,

341
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,380
it just all died out.

342
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,720
Like the dust settled really quickly.

343
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:49,620
It was like crazy.

344
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:52,260
It was like the biggest news
and then all of a sudden,

345
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:53,094
