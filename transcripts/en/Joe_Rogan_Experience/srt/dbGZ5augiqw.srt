1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:02,260
You ever,

3
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,600
you ever have a friend go crazy on you?

4
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,530
Yeah.

5
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,810
I've had friends that like
legitimately lost their mind.

6
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:07,760
I can't talk to them anymore.

7
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,370
Like,

8
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,820
like you would talk to them about events
and his version of events were just

9
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:11,971
like,

10
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,250
so not what actually happened.

11
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:14,750
You're like,

12
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,450
oh,

13
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,980
this is the person that's
lost their marbles.

14
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,843
Yeah,

15
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,151
yeah.

16
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:18,691
It happens.

17
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:22,530
You can temporarily lose your marbles
remanent luncheon or permanently.

18
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:22,860
Yeah.

19
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,820
But I think that like,

20
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,390
I mean,

21
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,201
yes permanently.

22
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:26,160
Of course there's like,

23
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:26,461
no,

24
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,020
I'm not saying through
psychedelics either.

25
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,063
No,

26
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:29,671
I know what you mean.

27
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:33,240
Just saying people that just can't keep
it together anymore and for whatever

28
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,020
reason,

29
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,670
whether it's a combination of life,

30
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:38,850
stress and biological situation,

31
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,500
whatever the fuck they've got going on,

32
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:40,981
you know,

33
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:42,330
uniquely in their own brain.

34
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,210
But some people just all of
a sudden not there anymore.

35
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,200
Not keeping it together.

36
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,090
Do they think they're keeping it together?

37
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,781
Sometimes.

38
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:48,990
Yeah.

39
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,823
I mean there's broad,

40
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,203
broad range,

41
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,630
right?

42
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,500
There's all kinds of,

43
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:52,771
yeah,

44
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:52,881
it's,

45
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:53,701
it sucks man.

46
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:54,241
People,

47
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:57,490
the brain is an organ
and it malfunctions and,

48
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,220
and sometimes you go nuts.

49
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,330
And that's,

50
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:02,190
and you get stigmatized for it,

51
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:04,260
which really sucks because if you like,

52
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,030
because that just adds to the problem.

53
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,050
Like if you,

54
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,401
you know,

55
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:07,800
I,

56
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,470
you see somebody in a
cast and you're like,

57
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:10,711
oh,

58
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:11,521
what happened to your arm?

59
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,091
And they'll tell you,

60
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:12,331
oh,

61
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:12,571
you know,

62
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:12,901
whatever,

63
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:13,734
I fell down.

64
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,151
But he,

65
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:14,351
you,

66
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:18,930
you talked to someone who's been like
hospitalized for a few weeks and they tell

67
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:20,070
you I had to go to the hospital.

68
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:21,150
I had a nervous breakdown.

69
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:22,140
I went crazy shit,

70
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:24,400
my pants and through my dog throw window,

71
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,913
you're like,

72
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,470
you're like,

73
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:27,830
you know,

74
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,180
you'll,

75
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,531
you'll want,

76
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:29,520
you want to be compassionate,

77
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:30,660
but there's some part of you that's like,

78
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,470
oh,

79
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,060
now this is a crazy person.

80
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,660
It's like,

81
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,250
it's just something happened.

82
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:37,380
The operating system temporarily crashed.

83
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,740
And quite often I think that
could be a very good thing.

84
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,510
I think that having your,

85
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,600
your personality or your ego or crash
can often mean that you were trying to be

86
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:50,670
somebody that you aren't.

87
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,460
And some people invest so much energy,

88
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,530
so much energy into trying to find me.

89
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:55,921
Yeah.

90
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:57,450
They just want to be some thing.

91
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,470
You know they they it,

92
00:01:58,471 --> 00:01:59,490
since there were a kid there,

93
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:00,390
mother was telling them,

94
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:01,260
you should be like this,

95
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,410
and then they try to be like
this and they hold up this thing.

96
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,550
They're always working to hold
up this giant tail feather and a,

97
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,650
their arms start shaking and that they
can't hold it up and that's when they

98
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:17,330
have like anger outbursts are suddenly
like their friends are like you.

99
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,960
You turned into someone
that I've never met.

100
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,070
I don't even know who that is.

101
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,581
It's like,

102
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:21,270
no,

103
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,961
that is,

104
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:22,890
you met them.

105
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,960
You met underneath the tail feather,

106
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,070
the seeding.

107
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:31,071
See anger and disappointment
and sadness that you met.

108
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:35,310
That thing that they're trying to
avoid by looking up at this mask,

109
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,170
they're holding up to the world,

110
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,760
but that fucking seeding,

111
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:40,020
see of disappointment,

112
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:42,330
anger and horror and sadness.

113
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,770
That's where it's at,

114
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:44,250
man.

115
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,650
You got to go into that thing
and it's for some people,

116
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:50,460
the only way they can go into that is
by having a full scale nervous breakdown

117
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,340
because then they can have
permission to dive into that,

118
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,370
into that awful vortex of darkness because
underneath that vortex of darkness is

119
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,643
paradise.

120
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,650
Underneath that that's love and happiness
and joy and connection and tranquility

121
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,560
and all that stuff and everyone's thinks
that the way to get to that point is by

122
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:13,561
avoiding this awful black forest
that surrounds the garden of Eden,

123
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:15,250
which is inside everybody.

124
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,300
It's inside everybody.

125
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,253
It's there,

126
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,760
it's there and it doesn't matter.

127
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,870
You know you can work out and that
will definitely give you a temporarily

128
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,610
temporary good feeling,

129
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,480
but until you address the internal
structures that you haven't acknowledged,

130
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,890
you're always going to go back to that
place where you find yourself morose and

131
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,920
depressed and angry
and you don't know why.

132
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,750
You always go back to that place until
you sit with the sadness inside of you.

133
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,650
You have to do that.

134
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,840
What you're describing is
coming out of the closet.

135
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,371
Yeah.

136
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,870
For a lot of people that is what it is.

137
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:47,261
Man,

138
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:51,220
it's coming out of the closet and there's
a lot of closets and there's not just

139
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,200
the gay closet,

140
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:52,360
right?

141
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,590
There's all kinds of closet.

142
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:54,910
There's the artists closet.

143
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,710
Some people are fucking accountants.

144
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,790
They're wearing suits and their ties on
tight and they're fucking like organized

145
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,600
and disciplined.

146
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,580
But inside they're probably painters.

147
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,380
They probably want to fucking paint.

148
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,100
They want to paint Dayglo
mountains down at the beach.

149
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:10,120
That's what they really are.

150
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,390
But their daddy or their mommy wanted
them to be a good little businessman.

151
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,540
So they became this thing that's
the opposite of what they are.

152
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,280
This is the verse in the Bhagavad Gita.

153
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:18,731
God,

154
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:20,560
forgive me cause I've quoted
it way too many times,

155
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,100
but it's,

156
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,570
it's better to be an honest street
sweeper than a dishonest king.

157
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,810
It's better to be a happy guy brushing
fucking leafs up the street than it is to

158
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:35,980
be some zillionaire who inside
is dying or numb or miserable.

159
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:36,820
Mostly Numb,

160
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,841
numbs the word.

161
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:38,674
Most people are just,

162
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,000
as long as these people
can quantify on paper,

163
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:44,310
I still have a x million dollar home.

164
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:48,420
My car is still cost x thousand
dollars this suit is an ex suit.

165
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,740
I am still ahead.

166
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,170
I am not going to
abandon all these things.

167
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:55,020
As long as they don't see
through the bullshit of the game,

168
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:55,950
they think they're winning.

169
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,040
They have to fall.

170
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:57,750
Yeah.

171
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,570
It's almost like you have to fall to,

172
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,630
to really,

173
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,920
that's what you got to appreciate those
moments when it all falls apart on you

174
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:07,230
because that means you've got
an opportunity to try it again.

175
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:07,750
This is,

176
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,660
let's take a new fresh perspective.

177
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,750
This is the cool thing that
at this retreat I went to
this Guy Jack Cornfield's

178
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:13,911
out,

179
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,650
which I really loved and
a great name by the way.

180
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,190
Yeah.

181
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,800
With a k not a c,

182
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:18,650
Jack Kornfield,

183
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,380
mortal Kombat k Jack Cornfield.

184
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,041
But he,

185
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:22,220
uh,

186
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,360
he's really cool man.

187
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,450
But he was cool with the kid.

188
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,770
He's like the cigarettes.

189
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,220
No,

190
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,230
this guy was awesome.

191
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:34,040
And he was one of the things he talked
about his in some religious tradition,

192
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,530
how they like hold the scriptures a rabbi.

193
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:36,741
Like,

194
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:39,260
how does students hold the
scriptures over their heart?

195
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,041
And,

196
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:40,874
uh,

197
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,400
when they were memorizing
them and they would say,

198
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:44,211
why do we do this?

199
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:44,571
And he said,

200
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:45,740
so that when your heartbreaks,

201
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:46,640
they'll fall in.

202
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,530
And it's a beautiful idea,

203
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:52,010
which is that heartbreak is
actually your ego cracking.

204
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:53,780
And the moment that cracks,

205
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,580
you're in the experience of truth.

206
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,900
And when you're in the experience of,

207
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,230
that's when you can
really become who you are.

208
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,740
But,

209
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,210
but to get to who you are,

210
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,111
it's like when you know,

211
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:04,580
on a bone heals the wrong way.

212
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,730
Like that's what a lot of
people's entire personality is.

213
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:11,240
It's like a bone that grew the
wrong way and that needs a fucking

214
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,060
check,

215
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,740
a snap or a crack,

216
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,161
you know,

217
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:14,551
and we,

218
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:15,580
you get that through slot,

219
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:16,981
you need that,

220
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:18,270
that initial fucking thing.

221
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:20,610
And it's a beautiful analogy and it hurts.

222
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,691
It hurts.

223
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:23,250
But we're paying avoiding creatures.

224
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:24,040
So we think that,

225
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,070
so we're always running
away from this pain.

226
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,220
But the problem is as we're
running away from pain,

227
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,740
we're still exactly in pain.

228
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,040
It's basically like being on
fire and running away from water.

229
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,110
You're just running away
from the water because you,

230
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,811
for some,

231
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:38,171
I don't know.

232
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:41,110
That's a stupid analogy
actually for great.

233
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:41,700
Up until that,

234
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,533
yeah,

235
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,930
you had a lot of great points.

236
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,850
It's true.

237
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,770
You know there's the monster in
the dark and the faster you run,

238
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:50,500
the more likely you are to
run into something that's
actually going to hurt you

239
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,210
as opposed to turning around and saying,

240
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,751
oh fuck.

241
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:53,584
There is no monster,

242
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,211
no monster.

243
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:54,401
You know?

244
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:56,950
But you're never get to know that
until you stop and turn around.

245
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,560
In some cases people don't have the
discipline or the the assistance or the

246
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:05,620
balls to stop and turn around so they
have to trip over something and then

247
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:06,010
there's like,

248
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:06,843
oh look,

249
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,410
that's the classic story.

250
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,430
Classic story of someone hiding a secret
and going completely out of control

251
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,050
because of the pressure of hiding that.

252
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,150
Like that's the Ted Haggerty who's the
secretly gay guy who's preaching against

253
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:19,780
gay people.

254
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,060
Ted Haggard and Colorado.

255
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,150
I was snorting meth off his gay lovers.

256
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,940
Yeah.

257
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,470
Yeah.

258
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,410
We was just going so far the other way.

259
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:32,190
He just so off the rails crazy himself.

260
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,010
He's being himself.

261
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,130
He was a guy who likes
to snort math off of Cox.

262
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,080
I still a little math and he likes to,

263
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:38,600
well,

264
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,640
there's a few Cox,

265
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,380
but I would say he wasn't being himself.

266
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:42,970
What I would say is that his,

267
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,030
his behavior was so extreme because he
was seeking balance between that and the

268
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:50,650
other bull shit in his life.

269
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,200
Whereas if he weren't living that,

270
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,560
he'd be right in the middle,

271
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,290
right?

272
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:54,610
Yeah.

273
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,070
Well to give,

274
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,020
but to get to the middle,

275
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:59,470
you know the way to get to the middle
weirdly is whatever the behavior is that

276
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:03,520
you're doing that you're so horrified
about and terrified of sometimes that

277
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,050
they're really weird ideas.

278
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,450
This is like something
that I liked that Ron says,

279
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:08,891
which is like,

280
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:09,100
Duh.

281
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,180
If you don't feel like meditating,

282
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:11,014
don't meditate.

283
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,071
Don't force it.

284
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,540
Don't impose this on yourself.

285
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,200
Keep doing the thing you're doing
that's upsetting you so much.

286
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:20,080
Have the balls to keep doing the
fucking thing that you're doing.

287
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,460
Keep doing it.

288
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,050
If society is going to tell you,

289
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:24,010
don't be like this,

290
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,180
stop being like this.

291
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:26,110
You have to change.

292
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,640
That's what your parents always say.

293
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,320
The idea is like no,

294
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,890
sink into what you are right now.

295
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,450
Just be that thing.

296
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Stop resisting exactly where
you are right now is perfect.

297
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:43,750
And that's a hard truth to grasp
because you think right away,

298
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:43,991
you think.

299
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:44,141
Yeah.

300
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,910
What about fucking Jeffrey Dahmer?

301
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,870
Is he perfect?

302
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,231
Well,

303
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:48,490
what about the leopard?

304
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,130
When you're seeing a leopard
rip apart a creature?

305
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,120
Is that thing per,

306
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,380
is that a perfect moment?

307
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,671
It fucks them.

308
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:55,504
And then him.

309
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,040
But

310
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,491
you know what?

311
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:57,324
Ducks do.

312
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,680
Docs or necrophilia acts.

313
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,240
Are they fucking evil creatures?

314
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,523
We think they are.

315
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,900
They are made that Phil Robertson Guy,

316
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,070
very famous person,

317
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,010
cause he invented a call for them.

318
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,790
And now poor gay people have to hear
that a man's anus is not as good as a

319
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,660
woman's vagina.

320
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,330
Can you imagine if you made the choice
for a man's anus and you hear this

321
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:18,300
fucking big bearded Fashionista with his,

322
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:18,540
uh,

323
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,060
Cammo on a Bandana is
absolutely fascinating.

324
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:21,781
So weird.

325
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:22,770
I never thought of that.

326
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,250
Big bearded Christian
Bible Slang Fashionista.

327
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:26,970
And uh,

328
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,340
he tells you that your
choice was incorrect.

329
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:29,911
That in fact,

330
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:32,100
the woman's vagina is the better choice.

331
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,240
The man's anus.

332
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:33,571
I mean,

333
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:34,740
come on guys,

334
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,800
but how can you say that if
you haven't experienced it?

335
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,651
Maybe.

336
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:39,011
Yeah.

337
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:39,920
I think he has a,

338
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:40,351
again,

339
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,370
the balance theory,

340
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:43,710
I think he's so outspoken on that issue.

341
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,880
Like most of these homophobes are because
they're home jerking off to gay porn,

342
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:48,840
but you know,

343
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,520
otherwise you just don't give a shit.

344
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:52,230
It just doesn't actually matter.

345
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:53,064
Right.

346
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,980
It doesn't come up in a GQ
interview duffing thing.

347
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:56,281
Right.

348
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:56,980
It's like Duh.

349
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,540
Already.

350
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,160
If you really care if people are gay,

351
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,020
Duh,

352
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,101
uh,

353
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:00,881
you really care.

354
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:03,450
The two guys love each other and
that you are you against love.

355
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,350
Yeah.

356
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,670
Love if it's a man and a woman.

357
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:05,821
Like,

358
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:06,930
what the fuck man.

359
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:07,351
Really?

360
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:08,184
Yeah,

361
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,760
it's done.

362
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,870
If you're talking about
men's anuses in Gq,

363
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,381
so you,

364
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:15,400
maybe you've got some
issues to think about.

365
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,400
Shouldn't we just be talking about ducks,

366
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,151
ducks,

367
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,440
any this season that your whole,

368
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:20,274
she knows the ducks.

369
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,890
You shoot ducks all the time.

370
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:23,071
Right?

371
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:23,730
That's your thing.

372
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,390
Let's just talk about murdering ducks.

373
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:25,691
Yeah.

374
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:30,090
Why you got to talk about men's asshole
ragging this in the blood stacks.

375
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,450
Well,

376
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,930
the only way you can live that
fake life as if it's fake.

377
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,741
The actual,

378
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:35,250
you know,

379
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:35,551
this,

380
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:35,910
this I,

381
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,400
this puritanical ideal
that they've held up.

382
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,580
It's not natural and they haven't been
really living in any way they've been

383
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:42,600
pretending to be living.

384
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:46,800
It would be freaks in this
sort of a rebound sort of
a way to balance everything

385
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:47,220
out.

386
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,660
And I think that ultimately that's being
exposed over and over and over and over

387
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:54,270
again to the point where it's not
going to be a viable option anymore.

388
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:58,440
Like powdered wigs aren't a viable option
and you can't wear a fucking powdered

389
00:10:58,441 --> 00:10:59,190
wig.

390
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,671
You know,

391
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:02,340
and you can't pretend you're this,

392
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:02,610
you know,

393
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,570
Rick Santorum,

394
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:04,404
guy that you know,

395
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,370
just as a good man who believes in
the Bible and doesn't want to see gays

396
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:09,204
getting married,

397
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,980
doesn't want to ruin the institution of
marriage with homosexual activity that's

398
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:16,740
been shunned upon in the Bible quote.

399
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,490
And you're like,

400
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,000
oh,

401
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,870
fucking crime.

402
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:19,380
Any,

403
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,191
what's going on?

404
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,730
Really?

405
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,620
What's going on behind
the scenes with you cat?

406
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,850
What is in your head then I keep waiting
for it to get to that point where

407
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:31,851
anybody who's got a big problem with
homosexuality is by default admitting to

408
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,480
their own homosexual life.

409
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,170
But I've been waiting 30
years for America to go,

410
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:37,591
come on.

411
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,150
This is too silly to be real.

412
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,961
Ronald Reagan,

413
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:40,590
are you kidding?

414
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,180
That guy was such a joke.

415
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,411
But you know,

416
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,890
he's St Ronald and the
seeds planted 30 years ago.

417
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,190
Well,

418
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,023
even then,

419
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,110
even then,

420
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:52,050
there was voted for him.

421
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,431
But you,

422
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:53,740
do you remember the criticism though?

423
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:54,910
It was pretty open.

424
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,890
There was a lot of people
that didn't like him.

425
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,310
I remember when he was an odd,

426
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,880
not enough that he didn't win 49
out of 50 states in Israel election.

427
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,021
Oh,

428
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:02,681
well listen man,

429
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,580
I'm not saying that.

430
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,030
You know,

431
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,030
he didn't dominate the
vast majority of the,

432
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:07,211
you know,

433
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:07,361
I mean,

434
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,410
there was a lot of idiots back then,

435
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:11,470
but the difference between the way people
look at them now and the way people

436
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:15,110
looked at him then now it's almost all
glowing when people talk about ranking,

437
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,720
and I hardly ever hear any criticism.

438
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,051
Yeah.

439
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:21,440
You don't hear about Iran Contra Nicaragua
and El Salvador and all of the crazy

440
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,653
all over north,

441
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,280
all over and all that craziness.

442
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,114
And you know,

443
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,343
yeah.

444
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,401
But my point,

445
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:31,240
my point is that this idea of it suddenly
we're going to wake up and realize how

446
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:32,230
ridiculous it is.

447
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:32,740
And it's a,

448
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,720
Rick Santorum is too ridiculous to be
real fucking what's her name's Sarah

449
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:37,770
Pailin.

450
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,300
Mm.

451
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,950
You know,

452
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,950
I am amazed that how flexible
the reality muscle seems to be,

453
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:48,760
that people are willing to accept this
stuff that Frank Zappa was laughing about

454
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:49,594
40 years ago.

455
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,070
Well,

456
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,610
I wonder if they are accepting it though.

457
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:52,091
I wonder.

458
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:55,030
I think that you watch these shows
enough and it creates the illusion of

459
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:55,864
acceptance.

460
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,590
But then if you,

461
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,140
if w anywhere on the internet or any,

462
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,130
you just see this constant
rebellion against that kind of,

463
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,120
um,

464
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,361
uh,

465
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:05,111
square,

466
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:05,921
mainstream,

467
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:06,820
homophobic,

468
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,530
angry personality and,

469
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:09,970
but you watch Fox News and yeah,

470
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:10,810
you watch Fox News.

471
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,730
Are you watching anything on TV?

472
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,020
And it's an illusion.

473
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,651
You know,

474
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:16,210
you watch the commercials,

475
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,320
everything's is big illusion.

476
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:21,720
You watch the commercials and it's like
people go in and buy a car and make it

477
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,421
seems normal.

478
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:26,200
It seems totally normal that people are
going in to get deeply in debt to the

479
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:26,591
banks.

480
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:28,000
That all seems incredibly normal.

481
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,000
But then more and more on
the Internet you see like,

482
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:31,690
uh,

483
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,050
people rebelling against this
and showing how the bankers,

484
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:39,270
like the whole system is this fucked up
thing and emerging things like bitcoin.

485
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,400
What's your like slowly moving
the energy away from it?

486
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,121
I don't know.

487
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:43,990
I didn't know what you mean.

488
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,400
I don't think it's going
to be a sudden thing.

489
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,080
I think it's going to be more like a,

490
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,610
just a gradual shift is
people just stop watching TV.

491
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,181
That's,

492
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,020
that's going to happen.

493
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:54,040
People are just gonna you know,

494
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,680
I drive down the street
billboards for fucking,

495
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,670
um,

496
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,010
like amazon.com shows,

497
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:00,401
you know,

498
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:03,910
like billboards for shows that aren't
really controlled by these big networks.

499
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,041
Netflix,

500
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:05,640
yeah,

501
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,270
yeah,

502
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:06,640
yeah.

503
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,780
But it's an Amazon,

504
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,070
just another big network.

505
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:09,760
I mean,

506
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,211
you know,

507
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:14,140
it doesn't matter if it's a network or
it's an international conglomerate or

508
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:14,711
whatever it is.

509
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:15,670
It's big money.

510
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,031
It is,

511
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:16,780
but you're right,

512
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,690
but that's just the bill.

513
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,410
Yeah.

514
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,070
The reality is it's that,

515
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,661
but yeah,

516
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:21,321
but it's not,

517
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:23,750
it's not right because the
media is a very different thing.

518
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,580
The media where you
talking about television,

519
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:28,220
you're talking about a very hard
thing to get into the medium.

520
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:29,060
When you're talking about an inner,

521
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:31,370
you're talking about an
incredibly easy thing to get into.

522
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,820
Literally open to almost anyone
with an internet connection.

523
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,430
You can make a youtube video
doesn't cost you a god damn dime.

524
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:37,700
Yeah.

525
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,080
You have a laptop that has a camera on it.

526
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:39,711
You talk into it,

527
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,390
you make a youtube video that,

528
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:41,811
yeah,

529
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:42,590
that's a big change.

530
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,330
That's not just a big change.

531
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,490
That might be the biggest
change in human history.

532
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,860
It might be the biggest change
since a monkey ate a mushroom.

533
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,820
Right.

534
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,020
Certainly since the printing,

535
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,170
the printing press was a major for sure.

536
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:54,730
Giant,

537
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,051
you know,

538
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:55,181
and,

539
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:56,680
and similar in the sense that it,

540
00:14:56,681 --> 00:15:01,670
it took the power of communication away
from very few and gave it to a lot more

541
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,650
right in,

542
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,940
that's sort of one of the more fascinating
things about this is that there is,

543
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:07,191
you know,

544
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:08,960
even if Amazon does,

545
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,190
but something online,

546
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,040
it's no better than I
Justine who has like,

547
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:13,251
you know,

548
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:16,120
45 fucking billion followers and she,

549
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,450
every video she put there,

550
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,330
there's people like that that just
became famous for the Internet.

551
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,630
Yeah.

552
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,980
Jenna marbles is another one,

553
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:22,430
right?

554
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:22,760
She,

555
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,340
she's got like millions and
millions and millions of hits.

556
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,101
Okay.

557
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:26,360
Yeah.

558
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,911
Here's what it is.

559
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:27,391
Here's what it is.

560
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:27,721
Cause I,

561
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:30,840
I'd just been reading
Sheldrake's new book,

562
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,680
um,

563
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,890
science set free and he talks about
morphic resonance or something.

564
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:35,850
And I know you have some,

565
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,500
I think you've,

566
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,360
you're skeptical about Sheldrake,

567
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,110
but,

568
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,943
uh,

569
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,560
I,

570
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,450
it's like when you've just have TV,

571
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,960
TV's a tuning fork and when there was no
internet and it was just TV and it was

572
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:47,820
a depiction of here's
what a family looks like,

573
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,110
here's what people tend to,

574
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:52,380
it's a corporation saying here's
what people do when they're healthy.

575
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,360
And that creates a tuning fork effect,

576
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:54,811
which is like,

577
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:55,890
if you're watching it enough,

578
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,000
you're going to either resonate
with or are in and feel like,

579
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:00,331
yes,

580
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:01,141
I'm doing great.

581
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:04,620
I have a wife and a house and a
car and a job and that's great.

582
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:06,990
I'm in tune with what
everyone else is doing.

583
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,160
But that's an illusion.

584
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,140
That's never been what
everyone else is doing.

585
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:13,230
It's just what massive
conglomerates are sending out there.

586
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:13,980
Um,

587
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,090
either in the form of hypnotic content
that keeps you glued to your seat.

588
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:21,690
As you watch corporations try
to get you in debt to buy cars.

589
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,231
You know,

590
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:22,381
it's,

591
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:22,650
it's,

592
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,401
it's generally,

593
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:23,970
it's just,

594
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,331
it's,

595
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:24,631
it's,

596
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:25,140
uh,

597
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,520
the whole thing is just,

598
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:26,990
uh,

599
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,780
uh,

600
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,550
tuning all of society,

601
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,121
uh,

602
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:33,210
in a way that society maybe
isn't meant to be tuned at all.

603
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,320
And so with the Internet now you have
all these different smaller tuning forks.

604
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:37,860
You know,

605
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,630
your podcast is a tuning fork.

606
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,440
People tune in to the stuff that you
talk about and the different people that

607
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:45,210
you bring on the podcast,

608
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,230
send out information that causes a
new kind of tuning to start happening.

609
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,690
So that's why when you
watch like Huckabee,

610
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,740
you'd really feel like you're like
listening to somebody sing off key cause

611
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:56,610
you're not resonating,

612
00:16:56,611 --> 00:16:57,450
you're not resonating.

613
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:59,340
You've been tuned into
a whole different thing,

614
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:00,390
which is what the internets,

615
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,030
I think one of the major
things the Internet has done,

616
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:03,601
you know,

617
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:05,060
you get these communities read it,

618
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,860
you can get tuned into the
reddit frequency quite easily,

619
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,810
where suddenly it all
just starts making sense.

620
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,400
And that is why the,

621
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:11,761
you know,

622
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:15,390
the duck dynasty guy or any
of these Weirdos who are,

623
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:16,224
um,

624
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,123
um,

625
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,140
are just ultimately just angry people.

626
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:22,290
That's why they seem so fucking crazy.

627
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,420
Or they play angry people on TV.

628
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,251
All right.

629
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:28,240
Cause I think a lot of
these people aren't even,

630
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,721
you know,

631
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:30,700
like in politics dynasty guy,

632
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,760
the duck dynasty guy has been giving
speeches like that for years that these

633
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,140
biblical retreats and stuff,

634
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,800
he's been doing that for this video.

635
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,010
Oh,

636
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,020
this is real schtick.

637
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:39,850
He's not fire and brimstone.

638
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,140
God fearing Christian man who was living
on the wrong side of the law and Jesus

639
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:47,350
at one point in time and then turn it all
around and wants to let everybody know

640
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:48,550
about the evils of sin.

641
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,890
He's an old dummy.

642
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,993
That's what he is.

643
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,880
He's an old dominion.

644
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,450
Loved their scientific name for him.

645
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,950
He's an old dummy to
probably just one time,

646
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,020
sucked a dick and liked it way too much.

647
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,570
If someone sucked his dick
and it's his favorite moment.

648
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,160
Ah,

649
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,210
it looks back on his childhood
and he's turned it into,

650
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:03,970
you know,

651
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,600
career.

652
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,460
I bet he was hunting
ducks when it happened.

653
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,110
I bet he was hiring that duck blind.

654
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:10,750
They're all liquored up and
moonshine and cozy hunting ducks.

655
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,411
I bet.

656
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:15,010
Right when he came into like
some guy's mouth years ago,

657
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,270
out in the out in the swamps,

658
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,420
he saw what they call it a duck blind.

659
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,263
Yeah.

660
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,570
I'm fine to pleasure and
shame mixed inside of me.

661
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:23,801
He's like,

662
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:27,720
I'm just going to kill.us from now
on and never think about this dog.

663
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,660
She didn't see shit.

664
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,050
Your Mother didn't see shit.

665
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:33,310
Your father didn't see shit.

666
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,470
Nobody son Shit good too.

667
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,380
Can you imagine if that's really what
it was all it was just a duck psalm.

668
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:42,270
Get his dick sucked by
a guy and he's like,

669
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:42,991
fuck that.

670
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:43,801
It didn't happen.

671
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:44,490
It didn't happen.

672
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,390
Need to kill ducks.

673
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,410
I think that's something
like that happened,

674
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:48,711
man.

675
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,060
It's something like that happen,

676
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,180
but you know man,

677
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,060
like what you do with with,

678
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,660
you know,

679
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,440
sex at dawn creates a resonance
where it's like it's a,

680
00:18:57,441 --> 00:18:59,510
it's a shame reliever.

681
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:00,111
It's a shame.

682
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:00,821
Reduce her man.

683
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:01,654
Because your book,

684
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,750
I think it has been,

685
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,740
it's such a compassionate book for
people who are stuck in monogamous

686
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:11,450
relationships and feel guilty about the
fact that they are attracted to other

687
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:15,890
people and that's like that guilt used
to be a normal guilt that was actually

688
00:19:15,891 --> 00:19:16,460
considered like,

689
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:16,581
oh,

690
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:18,560
something must be going
wrong with your relationship.

691
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,700
If you're thinking about fucking
other people and your book,

692
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,700
it show us like,

693
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:23,061
no,

694
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,300
actually that's just nature
happening through you.

695
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,750
You don't have to feel guilty about it
or like something's off balance in you.

696
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,310
It's just completely normal.

697
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,380
It doesn't mean you have to
go and fuck other people,

698
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,460
but at least now you don't have to feel
like I must not love or anymore or she

699
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:38,780
must not love me anymore.

700
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,590
What's that have to do with fucking docs,

701
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,030
country music songs.

702
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,010
That's the glue,

703
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:49,370
the glue that connects these two fucking
ducks and the sadness you have for not

704
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:50,620
wanting to be monogamy.

705
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,540
That's the glue that
keeps it all together.

706
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,890
It's the glue that holds the,

707
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,990
that's why you need listen
to Phil Robertson and that,

708
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,990
that God damn communist
and he that puts them on,

709
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:04,620
is that what it's on?

710
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,230
[inaudible] hilarious.

711
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,470
It's on a and e and I used to be like
fucking masterpiece theater and shit.

712
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,540
Yeah.

713
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,373
These to have like,

714
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:11,770
you know,

715
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,900
arts and entertainment,

716
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,101
you know,

717
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:14,641
interesting,

718
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:15,630
fascinating program.

719
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,010
And it's stimulated the mind.

720
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,740
I don't sell cars,

721
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,083
thou,

722
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,811
it's fucking,

723
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:22,644
you know,

724
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,680
people let found a storage box,

725
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,060
what's in the storage box.

726
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,970
But there's a lot of good stuff in there.

727
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,400
I bet there's nothing in
there more after the break.

728
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,263
Yeah.

729
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,901
I wonder what,

730
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,650
how much you take for that $500.

731
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:37,680
I can't give you five.

732
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:38,530
I can give you story.

733
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,190
I got to get at least four.

734
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:42,024
I don't know.

735
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,980
Cut to commercial narrative are,

736
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,371
I'll tell you,

737
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:47,800
this is my last offer and I'll be
in a serious cut to commercial.

738
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,461
Wow.

739
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:50,020
Wonder what his last offer is going to be.

740
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,830
Ah,

741
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,390
he got them down to three.

742
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,363
I wish I could,

743
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:01,600
yeah.
