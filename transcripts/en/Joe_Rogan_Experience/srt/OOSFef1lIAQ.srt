1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,050
And what's up man? How are you?
Good. Thanks for doing this.

2
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:08,160
Thank you for having me on.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,490
I was so impressed with your performance
from that past UFC that I had to had to

4
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:17,370
talk to you. I was like, that
was what I've seen guys make.

5
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:20,570
Like you were always a very dangerous
striker from obviously from the gold

6
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:22,710
gokarn Saki fight ever got.
Everybody got to see that.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,020
But to see how fluid you were
against a beast like Eric Anders.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,070
I mean Eric Andrews is a scary cat. Yeah,
he's, he's coming from blood. Right?

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,000
And you were so fast, man. It was crazy
to watch. It was really interesting.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,660
Thank you.

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,660
What if you had to give
yourself a percentage leap
that you've gone up over the

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,150
last year, what do you think it
would be compared to like, well,

13
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:46,110
who you were before that?

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,730
Not that high of a leap. I mean, the high
light, that performance for me was like,

15
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:58,380
I feel good about it, but that
was only four months. So I'm like,

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,470
I know that there's so much more for
me to gain. That's what I'm like, yeah,

17
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:03,870
I gotta go back. So the leap, not,

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,610
not too much because I know there's still
a lot more to go a lot more. Yeah. Wow.

19
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:11,640
So you've decided, so for people who
don't understand what we're talking about,

20
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:16,180
you went to Thailand, he spent four
months down in Thailand and um, you,

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,750
you were fighting like a Thai box.
It was crazy.

22
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:22,830
Like Mark [inaudible] who works in the
production truck and he's the guy picks

23
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:23,970
out the insert replays.

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,870
He and I talked back and forth sometimes
while the fights going on and mark mark,

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,360
you know, with his heavy Boston
accent, like, dude classic,

26
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,300
he's classic Chi stance and you would
just, the light on that front leg

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,590
inside leg kick was so far
rochus it was fun to watch men.

28
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,380
So it's just usually wherever I go. Um,

29
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,470
I've always been good at just like kind
of absorbing the culture. I'm a guy,

30
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:54,730
like I can go into a room full of people
and I can just kind of pick up what the

31
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:57,940
energy is like. And that's another
reason why I wanted to go to Thailand.

32
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,630
So just the way that they
train and the discipline,

33
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,280
the power, but the relaxation, like
everything I was learning, just like man,

34
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:11,380
there's so much more to Moy Tai.
So I would just,

35
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,510
even the days that I didn't train,

36
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:17,260
I just sit around and just watch these
guys because moy ties more than just

37
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:20,320
punching, kicking elbows, men, there's
balance. You know what I mean? There's,

38
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:24,460
there's repetition. Like how many
kicks are you throwing? You know,

39
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:27,130
the guys at the stadiums, they're
like their Kik, Kik, Kik, Kik.

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,050
So I was able to learn a lot, my
aunt, and there's still a lot to go.

41
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,980
It's beautiful to see that someone on
that pursuit. And I think it's, um,

42
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,870
it's much like Roger May,
whether said about boxing,

43
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,640
like most people don't
know shit about boxing.

44
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:42,610
And you know what he said that was like,

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,630
if anybody is going to say that he's
going to say that because there are levels

46
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:50,260
and layers and there's,
there's paths to go down.

47
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:55,261
And it's interesting when you see
someone like committed with a very,

48
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,770
like a very specific style, like your
like adoption of that Moy Thai style.

49
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:03,460
So if it's so effective
as a striking style,

50
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,270
it's really interesting when you think
of all the different ways to attack with

51
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,260
striking that one way became
very particularly successful.

52
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,693
You know what,

53
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,350
before I even started
training MMA as a whole,

54
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,270
um, my first mixed martial, my first
martial arts class was annoyed tie class.

55
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,680
I knew that I wanted to train
Moitai or to learn when we tie. Um,

56
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,970
and so since I've started I always
thought like, yeah, I want to go there.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,850
You know, just maybe it's cool. But um,

58
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,160
moist has always been my thing,

59
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,530
but I had never really learned it like
the actual way, you know, like from,

60
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,510
from the root of, uh,
of where it comes from.

61
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,530
I always just kind of like pass down or
like Brazilian style, Moy, Tai, you know,

62
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:48,970
like shoot the box type stuff.

63
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:53,971
So that's completely different from
stadium we tie and most people don't know

64
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:58,750
shit about stadium way tie.
Right? Like unless you go
to, unless you go to Bangkok,

65
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,350
let's characterize it for people.
You,

66
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:03,760
could you say that that core of Tiva
style is just way more aggressive,

67
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,750
different a different way
they utilize techniques? Yeah,

68
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:09,220
it's light on the front leg.

69
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,330
So sometimes the are like more shogun
would be light on his front leg a little

70
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:17,020
bit. One thing that they were doing
a lot that it's pretty similar.

71
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,710
It's just that they go at it,
shoot the box, they'll go at him.

72
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,800
You just go until the other
guy stops. Pretty much. Um,

73
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,600
but from the shoot the box,

74
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:29,620
I was like very combo based like
punches and kicks are like one,

75
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:33,880
two like you have to memorize these
crazy combos accord arrow. Is he like,

76
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:37,330
I think he is one of the guys that
just passed it down along Diego.

77
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:38,350
Lima think guys like that.

78
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:43,351
But yeah they have this system and
it's very like combination based um,

79
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,040
memory slipping Punchkick all this stuff.
But the ties are just like,

80
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,340
it's just straight kick,
you know, like punch view.

81
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,540
You fall down on that front
foot, elbow, knee. It's just,

82
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,950
it's broken down completely differently.
It's just a whole,

83
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:04,510
whole different style. Yeah, it is like,
so the shoot the box stuff has punches,

84
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:08,710
kicks, knees, elbows, combination, same
tools that you're going to use in Moitai.

85
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,400
But when we tie has got a whole different
game plan, you know, the clinching,

86
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,530
like I've never trained as much clinching
in America as I have in Thailand in

87
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:21,610
just four months. And I've been fighting
our training now for like nine years.

88
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,800
So just in four months I've gotten more
clinch time in Thailand that I have in

89
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:30,040
my whole career. And that's because
it's a whole different game.

90
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,990
You got to master the clinch and t in
Noida you have to for effective like real

91
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:38,680
true. Moitai uh, you getting a
lot of wrestling over there. Yeah.

92
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:43,000
So that's one thing too. I heard, um,
I heard shop talking about it. Um,

93
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,900
tiger has amazing,
it's an amazing gym,

94
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,780
40 to 60 guys on the mat from
everywhere. Chechnya. Wow. You know,

95
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,230
in everywhere, in everywhere. Man. Those
guys, they come there maybe for a week,

96
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,150
maybe two weeks, maybe for a
month. But you're getting constant,

97
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,190
um, good training, grappling,
everything, MMA, boxing, crossfit,

98
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,000
ev, everything you need is in one place.
It's, it's a blew my mind being there,

99
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,730
honestly. Um, that's
fascinating. And your,

100
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,630
are you the coaches that you
were working with before?

101
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,790
Are you still working with them and
Thailand? Are you just going to,

102
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,510
I know you talked about actually
moving to Thailand. Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:26,600
The plan is to move there like as
soon as possible. Really? Yeah.

104
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:29,180
So I was like hitting you up like Joe,
I want to get on your show.

105
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:32,730
I want to talk a little bit.
Um, but yeah, I want to, um,

106
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,050
the plan is to move to Thailand like with
the next couple of weeks for at least

107
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,110
a year.
And I want to go there just because

108
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,510
I can just train. The
lifestyle's completely
different. I can walk to the gym,

109
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,820
hop on a motor bike. It's
just, it's so simple. Um,

110
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,520
but to answer the question
about my coaches, um,

111
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,330
I always have my brother and my corner.
He's just kind of like moral support.

112
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,220
We started this together.
Um,

113
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,340
I had a conditioning coach slash friend
slash mental type of like support,

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,720
um,

115
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Lorenza Patrica and then my head coaches
have switched probably two or three

116
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:12,120
times in the last couple of fights I
had Kenny Johnson from black house, um,

117
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,880
John Wood from syndicate. And now I have
George Hickman from Tiger Moy. Tai. Yeah.

118
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,620
And so this change that
you decided to make a,

119
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:26,120
did it come after the Johnnie Walker
fight? Yeah. So the Johnnie Walker fee,

120
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:28,610
like that camp was tough man.

121
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:33,611
Like I was doing so much to try to improve
in my wrestling and grappling because

122
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,180
that was always like a
big hole in my game. Um,

123
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:43,330
so I spent so much time wrestling over
at Black House with Kevin Casey and this

124
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:46,520
guy that I fought Blake troop.
They're huge and these guys are great.

125
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:48,550
Grapplers telling Casey's a powerhouse.
Yeah.

126
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,000
He'll put you into the ground and he feels
like cement block on top of you sells

127
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,480
old school. Hixon Jujitsu.
Exactly. How pressure, man. So, um,

128
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,500
yeah,
I would,

129
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,160
I would just grinding myself into the mat
every day for that camp expecting like,

130
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:05,870
okay, I'm comfortable on the feed. If it
goes to the ground, I'm ready. And um,

131
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,520
I, I think I just completely lost sight
of like my striking my Muay Thai in that

132
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:14,520
fight, his size, everything. I just kind
of froze up man. I was just like, ah,

133
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,650
I didn't know what to do, how to get
there. So let's all part of the education,

134
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:22,450
right? I mean this is what does
this career of fighting that you're,

135
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,590
you're on this path is
what it's all about. Yeah.

136
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,680
And fighting for me is like big
self awareness too. You know?

137
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,580
I think it's always important though
when a guy has set setback to see how he

138
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:34,550
responds. Some people get discouraged,
some people get encouraged,

139
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:37,190
some people just decide like they're
going to be much more committed.

140
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:38,030
And that's what you did.

141
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,780
You just mean making that move to do
your camp and Thailand and seeing how it

142
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:42,650
paid off.
I mean,

143
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:47,390
Eric Anders is a very tough customer
and you essentially shut him out. Yeah.

144
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,910
I mean, it was very, very
impressive man. That was the,

145
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:52,550
that was the plan though
because I knew he was tough.

146
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,610
He's tough with them before I sparred
with him before everything in like he's,

147
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,280
I've watched all of his fights.
The guy's hard to put it away.

148
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,850
We're making a case for the fight being
stopped. Yeah. We were making a case.

149
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:07,320
I mean DC was saying like we could stop
this fight. I was saying it, I was like,

150
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,370
you are fucking his legs up. I like,
this is about it. During the fight.

151
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:15,510
I wasn't like, I'm sure you weren't, but
that guy is so damn tough. He kept coming,

152
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:18,990
man. I mean he never stopped
trying to win that fight. Yeah.

153
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,090
There's no quit in him. None. I mean
even in the, in the Santos fight,

154
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,240
remembering that it was just
do or die tweets. He's like,

155
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,980
I haven't been that tired since like my
wedding night or something like that.

156
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:32,400
He's always got good good tweets after
the final shout out to Eric Andrews.

157
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,440
I love what Jon Anik said too.

158
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,390
He loves what he fights cause then
Bruce buffer has to say, your boy

159
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,980
boy, hey, why does it,

160
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,240
where does keep a suits? Man, he's got a
new suit. Oh, does a bad mother fucker,

161
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:54,380
dude. The insides of always has
like different decorations. Shit.

162
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,960
They commemorate different places
where we're at Bruce Buffer, he's,

163
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,770
he's got style. I just imagined him
have a level on his house just oh yeah.

164
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,210
You know what I mean?
Like you go to Nordstrom or something,

165
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:10,140
but his is just all the suits that
is warm before. I mean I'm less,

166
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:14,060
he donated so he might donate them
to charity. That might be one of the,

167
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:17,850
or auction them for charity or something
like that. That'd be good. Yeah. He's a,

168
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:21,140
he's a fun dude. He's the best
ring announcer of all time to me.

169
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,700
When that guy starts wailing and he gets
so pumped up serious, it's fucking hard.

170
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:29,070
Gets right. He's so intense, man.

171
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,220
Like if you watched boxing,
they're much more smooth.

172
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,770
Bruce buffer and do it, man. He digs in.

173
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:41,240
I remember seeing him first yelled at
like at Tj Dillashaw and he was like, oh.

174
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,720
I was like, Oh shit. It gives
you goosebumps. It really does.

175
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:48,630
It gives you goosebumps. Yeah. You just
feel as energy, right? You're just like,

176
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:50,970
I'm there waiting, ready for a
fight. Like I'm kind of nervous.

177
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:54,240
And then Bruce comes over like,
yeah, out of the blue corner.

178
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:59,110
You're like talking about dude who blew
his ACL out from jumping up in the air

179
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,510
while he was reading that name.
Oh my God.

180
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,110
She gets bruised here is fucked his
knee up from just getting crazy.

181
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,790
Oh Joe, really quick.
What do we got? Okay,

182
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:16,380
so remember I told you to turn
your air drop off during the show.

183
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,110
So I didn't want to
come here empty handed.

184
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,670
So I haven't slept in probably

185
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,210
24 hours more than 24 hours.

186
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,060
But last night I was drawing and I
know you like art. So I was like,

187
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,990
let me draw these illustrations for you
so I just want to send them to you. Okay.

188
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:41,460
So turn your air drop on. It's on. And as
soon as it comes through I'll send them.

189
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,140
But yeah, I really just
like, man, I just want to,

190
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,130
if you want to keep them, use them
for like wallpapers or post him up.

191
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:53,130
Whatever you want made this.
Yeah, I did all these man too.

192
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:56,320
That's what I look ridiculous.
Yeah, I did the little like

193
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,240
I'll put it on Instagram later. Cool man.
It's very cute when it looks like me.

194
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,630
I'm getting ugly as I get older.
I see pictures of me when I was younger.

195
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,390
You in the gym and you had this like
crazy for is I'll actually show you the,

196
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,590
the um, the actual one is really like
know what you're talking about. Yeah.

197
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:17,950
I was going crazy during the stupid chat
fitness challenge I was having with my

198
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:18,770
friends.

199
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,210
We were working out to six hours of
cardio a day trying to beat each other and

200
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:26,100
it's so stupid. That's what I was taking.
That patient has a good one. I was like,

201
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:30,500
yeah, let me, let me copy
that. So when you uh,

202
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,940
decide to move, you take it,
anybody with you, you go solo.

203
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,550
I'm going to start off going solo.
Um, I would like to get, you know,

204
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,020
my brother to come visit.

205
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,460
I'd like to get my mom to come out really
as many some out there. Yeah. Yeah. And,

206
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:49,120
and just cheap and just kind of
simple living. My, and my mom,

207
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,680
I don't think she's ever left the country,

208
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,680
so I think it'd be really
cool for her to go out there.

209
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,110
But at the moment I'm just really like,

210
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,170
this place is great for my career
right now, Greg from my training.

211
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:02,860
So I just want to get there asap
and get back to work. Sorry.

212
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:06,940
How do you account for
jetlag? Like, do you,

213
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,350
do you just,
uh,

214
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,370
like do you give yourself enough time
to adjust to the time difference?

215
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,510
You know what, the whole time I was
there I would, my sleep schedule was off.

216
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:17,500
I never adjusted,

217
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,680
so I was going to bed maybe 2:30
AM every morning then like get up,

218
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,930
run at five and then, you know, just
tired later. Get tired later. Yeah. Weird,

219
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:29,380
right schedule is all off.

220
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:32,590
And then when I came back it took
me like a week or two to adjust,

221
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:37,290
so I was disappointed how stupid
my body was, man. Hey dummy,

222
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,550
go to bed now. I'm telling you,
you just go to bed now. Like,

223
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,720
like I didn't know my body
had such a rigid schedule.

224
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,380
When you jack that thing sideways and
you're on the other side of the planet

225
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,170
that your body just really doesn't know
what the fuck is going on. Seriously.

226
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:54,220
And then for me being stuck in that
plane for so long. Yeah, it's like, yeah,

227
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:57,730
you too big for them.
A little seats too when you do that.

228
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,640
If say if you have a fight in Vegas,
I'm going to go from Thailand to Vegas.

229
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:04,810
Do you show up two weeks early?
Yeah. Well this is my first time.

230
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,500
I'm flying back to the states after being
in Thailand and I flew a week early.

231
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,000
No,
I flew two weeks early.

232
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:13,150
One Week I stayed in Vegas and then
fight week stayed in Atlanta and I think

233
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:15,740
that was perfect timing. Oh that's
good. So like you get a little,

234
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:19,510
a little difference in time between
those, whether two minutes, it's so hot.

235
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,530
Like we train outside and
it's humid and hot. So, um,

236
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,570
between every round it feels like, you
know, like the third round of a fight.

237
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,240
If we're going into the championship
rounds, I've never been there,

238
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:34,800
but I'd imagine that it
feel very shitty and uh,

239
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,700
that's how it feels
every round in Thailand.

240
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:41,380
It's just like you're covered
in sweat, hot, thick. Yeah.

241
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,500
That was probably like my fifth round
or something like that. And we do it.

242
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:45,880
I'll be dead by this point.

243
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,790
Shout out to the editor for making
me not look as tired as I was.

244
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,351
Yeah.

245
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,560
So what we're looking at folks for the
people who are just listening and it's a

246
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,770
bunch of videos of you training,
strength conditioning,

247
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:05,240
palling up against the the wall. So you
getting everything down there. Yeah.

248
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,050
And that's Joseph Hanley right there. He
was on the, uh, on the ultimate fighter.

249
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,040
I forgot what season they called them.
Leah Unitus,

250
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,410
he's a black belt out there and he
helped me out a lot. Man, there's,

251
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,230
you run into so many different people
and he's like, yeah, like black belt,

252
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,780
any type of grappling you want,
any positions you want to work,

253
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:22,700
like we'll go over it,
we'll create a system whenever.

254
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,370
And so he was really big help in this
preparation for this fight. Yeah.

255
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,510
A bunch of free spirits live in
that. Right. So many, so many.

256
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,120
But everybody's down there with a goal.
If they want to get in shape,

257
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:36,180
they want to get healthy or spiritual
path, whatever it may be. Yeah.

258
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,740
There's something romantic about the
ex pat living in Thailand having a good

259
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:43,670
time, you know, something romantic
about that. So it's interesting.

260
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,600
That's really cool. Yeah, I mean
that whole culture man, I mean the,

261
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:52,040
the tie and Moy Thai culture.
What a phenomenon.

262
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,220
If you look at combat sports and the
this one that it's so tied into these

263
00:15:57,411 --> 00:16:01,910
stadiums, it's so tied into gambling
and netting. It's so, I mean,

264
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,440
kids get indoctrinated into it at a
very young age for young, super young.

265
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,280
There's, there's guys at the gym
that I was at, um, little kids.

266
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,150
They'd come right after school and they
go to Moitai training and their training

267
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,720
just like the older guys and then
they go right back to home, like home,

268
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:21,650
eat dinner. But that's just their
lifestyle. So it, it starts as a kid.

269
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:24,710
It's like go to school,
Moy, Tai, go sleep.

270
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,170
And then as an adult it's like Moitai feed
your family, Moy, Tai, feed your family.

271
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,240
These guys live at the gym at Jesus.

272
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,380
They live at the gym and they go home
maybe two days after a fight just to take

273
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:39,650
care of their families and then come right
back to the gym and get ready for the

274
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:44,060
next height. Now of course at Tiger
Moy, Tai, you know, you've guys,

275
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,710
everybody knows diff,
various people in different organizations,

276
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,820
UFC Bella tour, what have you, uh, one fc,

277
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,020
but what about those guys
that are fighting in those
little small tie gyms and

278
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:57,651
stadiums?

279
00:16:57,651 --> 00:17:01,400
Like how much access do they have to
grappling or how good do they ever,

280
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,240
did they, are they satisfied to
just do more tires here at all?

281
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,320
Like a movement in Thailand,
especially at tiger. Um,

282
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,680
a lot of those guys are coming
over to the MMA and learning,

283
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:16,640
Jujitsu and wrestling. One of the guys
I was learning to clinch from, um,

284
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,000
he was like, um, he's got
probably 300 fights, um,

285
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,100
300 Moy Thai fights and he started
training MMA and taking him and may fight.

286
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:27,970
So it's death there. They're definitely
opening their mind to it and, and,

287
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,890
and hopping in there and there's access.
And Bangkok, it's a little different. Um,

288
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,240
cause that's very like stadium
based, you know, like high level Moy,

289
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:40,940
Tai and uh, they're not too focused on
in May, there are a couple of MMA gyms,

290
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:43,790
but if you want to do that, if you want
to get the best of both worlds, it's in,

291
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,220
it's implicate a tiger. So, uh,

292
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,900
is there any MMA at all in Bangkok?
Ah,

293
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,440
they got a couple places but nothing with
like at like pro fighters or any high

294
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,760
level fighters.
But they do have,

295
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,530
they do have maybe three or four MMA
gyms there with just guys stopping in or

296
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:04,140
guys who practice, you know,
a little bit of everything.

297
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,760
I'm always really interested in countries
that figure something out better than

298
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,940
everybody else when it
comes to leg kicking in.

299
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:13,410
Like nobody figured it out
any better than at the time.

300
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,490
It's like no one argues that right
now. Seriously. And their shins man,

301
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:20,430
like I think they're just,
that's done for,

302
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,190
they don't even feel the front of their
legs anymore because they can kick

303
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:27,120
anything and they're getting kicks
checked. There's guys that Joe,

304
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,950
they'll fight one night at the stadium,

305
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,160
go five rounds and then sleep and maybe
the next day go fight like another small

306
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:39,990
event or a smaller event sometime even
in the same night. And it's like, man,

307
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,100
aren't you like your shins?
Don't hurt your elbows. No
hurt, nothing in these guys.

308
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,030
They're just like, they're bulletproof.
They're used to this man. It's crazy. Wow.

309
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,190
And their first time in my life,

310
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,830
I go into a locker room and the red and
blue corner as both in the same room,

311
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,370
probably as big as the studio and
they're all getting their hands wrapped

312
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,530
together, getting massaged
out together. Everything,

313
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,090
no weird energy in the room like you know,

314
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:09,780
and UFC like they separate us. We have
to kind of be separate whatever purposes.

315
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:13,290
But like in Thailand, they're just like
hanging out in same room, you know,

316
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,380
talking, whatever, and then they just
go fight right after. It's so weird,

317
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,840
like the piece, it's, it's so weird man.

318
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,640
It was the first time I
experienced that and I was like,

319
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:24,210
maybe I can start lightening up a
little bit. Like that's only a fight.

320
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:26,400
And that's kind of something
I had to tell myself. Um,

321
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,540
for this one I had to like really fall
back and rely on my training because I

322
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,070
was really nervous. I
was nervous to start, um,

323
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,910
to try the new stuff that I learned out.

324
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,540
I never through many leg
kicks in any of my fights. Um,

325
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,040
I'd never really did that stance.

326
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:45,780
Everything that I did was pretty much
brand new. Um, and I was really nervous.

327
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:49,980
I was like, what if it doesn't work?
You know, like so many different,

328
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,580
so many different feelings.
And um, for this one, I,

329
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,770
the only thing I can tell myself was like
rely on your training and a few other

330
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:03,090
things. I actually got, um, I got
like hypnotized to before. Yeah.

331
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,050
Two who did too. Um,
and my friend Dominique,

332
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,260
he has, he has this, like I
met him through one of the,

333
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,140
um, one of the other UFC fighters.
Like Julian Marquez. I met him,

334
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,400
I met him through him and he's like, oh
yeah, I do like hypnotism, all this stuff.

335
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:24,530
I'm like, okay cool. I've done it
before. I did it in California and um,

336
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,870
so I think three weeks,
two or three weeks prior to the fight,

337
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,160
we had a few sessions a week where
just like helped me to really get that

338
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:34,950
visualization clear cause we have so
many thoughts all the time. Right.

339
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:35,491
And everything,

340
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:39,810
just like thoughts are constantly coming
in and to stay focused and to really

341
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:41,580
like,
like

342
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,130
get the outcome that we know, set
our intention to. It's Kinda hard.

343
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,480
So many distractions.

344
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:53,980
So when you go into his office in or
wherever you do it and you guys talk about

345
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:57,100
it, do you set a goal before
you start the session?

346
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,460
We do this thing called timeline therapy,
so it's like,

347
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,820
I'm just kind of sit in there
with my eyes closed and, um,

348
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,830
we kind of just do this,
we'll pick a subject, whether
it's like, you know, pain,

349
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:12,880
fear, you know, nervousness, something.
We'll just pick a subject, a feeling,

350
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:15,130
whatever's going on.
And um,

351
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,020
it's kind of just like a visual
timeline of like, where did this start,

352
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,830
where it come from, what's
the event, whatever.

353
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,880
And we kind of just talk about
that for awhile. And, um,

354
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,910
I just kinda dig to this place of where
the nervousness is coming from or where

355
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:34,150
the, you know, where the fear is coming
from or whatever. I kind of just,

356
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:38,340
I find a place on my timeline and I dig
from it, whether it's in the future,

357
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,790
the past, whatever, and then
when you get things clear.

358
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:47,530
And then, um, and then after
that he kind of helps me,

359
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:49,540
guides me into this like hypnotism,

360
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,480
which is really just like
a really deep relaxation.

361
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,170
If I wanted to open my eyes or something
like that, I feel like I could,

362
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,010
but I wanted to relax. I
wanted this to help, you know,

363
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:01,420
I wanted my vision to be clear.

364
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,270
So I did my best to just like
surrender to the process.

365
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:08,500
And I'd say it's not something where
I woke up and I was like, oh yeah,

366
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,840
my life has changed.
But um,

367
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,160
I can definitely remember the thoughts
that I had so that I can stay more on

368
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:20,050
like in that,
in that lane of what I wanted in my,

369
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,230
in my hypnotism actually visualized,

370
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,880
not winning the fight because I
didn't want to strive too hard to win.

371
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,640
Like it's just something that
I've been kind of studying.

372
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:35,641
It's like the outcome is not
really like the winning or losing.

373
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:37,150
I don't want to base too much on that.

374
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,190
I just want to put on
like a great performance.

375
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,180
So I visualized after one thing hand,

376
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,810
like just having my hands in the air,
seeing my brother smile,

377
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,760
my coach a smile and then slapping hands
with the crowd, um, on the way out.

378
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,810
And then I was also like,

379
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:57,070
and I want to see my wind bonus and my
show money and these are the things that

380
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:59,490
I wanted to see.
These are the outcomes that I wanted.

381
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,350
Not so much just I want to win the fight,
but the things that I like,

382
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:07,300
how I wanted it to happen
and having that vision clear,

383
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,140
it helped me.

384
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,000
And so like everything that I visualized
before that it happened, I was like,

385
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:16,510
cool, hands raised, slap hands with
everybody on the crowd the way out,

386
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,300
sign both my checks.
And that was like,

387
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,630
that was the end of it for me until the
next session until I want to get clear

388
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:25,540
on something else, you
know? It was cool. Wow.

389
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,120
So had you didn't
anything like that before?

390
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:31,750
Any mental coaching before the go comes
hockey fight? I did something very,

391
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:33,850
very similar. Yeah. With um,

392
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,310
with another guy I was at the
first time you'd ever done it?

393
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,300
First Time doing hypnotism.
Yeah, definitely.

394
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,760
And um, yeah, my friend
Matthias, he's here and uh,

395
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,630
he's really good too. And he
was just like, take some notes.

396
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:51,140
You kind of just have a conversation in
the beginning and everything comes from

397
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,110
your unconscious mind.
It's not somebody telling you something.

398
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,470
I just dumped out whatever my
unconscious mind was telling me.

399
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,930
He was just helping me to like relax,

400
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,870
be at peace and just listen
to like my unconscious mind.

401
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:07,871
Just unfold all of these kind of
like hidden answers that we all have,

402
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,640
you know?
So that's it.

403
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:15,650
Now when you get hypnotized and you're
thinking about a specific fight,

404
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,220
do you think about specific things
you're trying to accomplish?

405
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,910
Things that you think you'll do to him
that you'll have an advantage at or

406
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:24,810
strategy or like how do you,

407
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,220
those were thoughts that were
happening before my hypnotism,

408
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:36,250
but then all of those thoughts were
coming from the anxiety coming from the

409
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:40,820
nervousness. You get what I'm
saying? Yes. So it's like,

410
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,910
let's go back on the timeline to
why you're feeling nervous. Yeah.

411
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:46,280
Like all these things are happening.
They're going to you,

412
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,030
you're anticipating all of these things
happening and it's making you feel

413
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:53,930
nervous. So let's go back
to the nervousness and
revisit that. Why, you know,

414
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,030
and then when my subconscious,

415
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,130
my unconscious mind is just
like spewing things out.

416
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,640
And then after the process of
that mixed with the hypnotism,

417
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:08,930
I'm not even thinking about, oh, I'm
going to hit this arm drag or whatever.

418
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,700
I just, I'm thinking about having
my conscious clear in my mind,

419
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:18,170
clear and everything so that I
can get the expectation that like,

420
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,970
or the visualization that I created.
Yeah.

421
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,640
So have you tried different versions of
that or different styles of hypnosis?

422
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:32,270
Mm, no. Not that I can. I mean,

423
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:34,880
I've done a lot of just like closed.

424
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,830
I like emotional intelligence
type of like exercises,

425
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,090
you know,
like where I'm just like,

426
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:46,040
my eyes are closed and I have someone
helping me visualize internally,

427
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,090
you know,

428
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:52,090
like just whether it's dreams or
emotional pain or whatever it may be.

429
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,730
Yeah. I've had people just like
guided meditation almost. Yeah.

430
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,350
But the actual name, like hypnotism,
I've only had it done by two people.

431
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:04,970
Well, it as when you're
watching fighters, if you are,

432
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:09,971
I think fighters or one of
the most complex puzzles
for psychologists because I

433
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:16,310
think it's a super rare state, like the,
the rare state that someone gets to the,

434
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:19,270
where they can be completely calm
and see everything in the heat of a,

435
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:22,550
a dangerous encounter with
another train fighter. Yeah.

436
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,070
And when you're watching
these things play out on TV,

437
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:30,071
and you often times see how much
anxiety plays a factor or doesn't play a

438
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:32,630
factor,
how much someone having the,

439
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:36,020
I don't give a fuck attitude
for real at Ken play.

440
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,170
It can be a benefit and it
can fuck you up sometimes too.

441
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,380
And to see these complex psychological
puzzles play and see fighters struggle

442
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:49,980
and then regroup, have a bad fight and
come back better. All that stuff is like,

443
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,690
it's, it's really like a giant
microscope on the human character,

444
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:55,621
you know?

445
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:59,010
And like a guy like you who comes back
from the Johnnie Walker fight and looks

446
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,250
sensational against Eric Andrews.
Man,

447
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:05,160
it was like that was one of those things
you're like, I like what I'm seeing.

448
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,600
This guy, he figured some shit out
man. I mean like does that was,

449
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:11,670
that was incredible.
It was really fun to watch.

450
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,750
Matt is the guy who really loves Moy
Tai. It was fun to watch. Thanks man.

451
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,160
That was,
and that's,

452
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,220
that's kind of the goal too going forward
is that I want to continue to like put

453
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,001
on stuff like that,

454
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:24,260
continue to learn more Thai and then
cause that fight kind of raised the bar,

455
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,760
right? People are like,
Oh man, this guy for sure.

456
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,570
It kind of put me back on the map. So now
I'm ready to just go back and you know,

457
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,480
how many guys use mental coaches now?
If you had to guess.

458
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,690
A good handful. Good hand.
Yeah, a good handful I think.

459
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,030
I think a long shoreman Vinny
shoreman, he hypnotized me and he, uh,

460
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,630
he open houses a lot of fighters.
Yeah. Yeah. He's, yeah, it was a trip.

461
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,450
It was very strange. It was like, oh,
this is real. It's a weird feeling. Right.

462
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,370
How long ago was it?
It was the old studio,

463
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:57,150
so it had to be at least a year and a
half, maybe two years ago. Okay. Yeah,

464
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,750
it was pretty weird. But he's a
great mental coach too, though.

465
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:05,400
He knows like what's creeping around
your subconscious just waiting to pop up

466
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:07,940
and play tricks on you. You
know, you shouldn't eat. Sure.

467
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,730
You're putting enough rounds. Where does
he live? A, he's a UK guy. Okay. Yeah.

468
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,820
I kind of get linked up with him. I'm all
about it. I don't care anybody. I'm like,

469
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:18,900
yeah, whatever. You got any short
man? Let's go. Yeah, he's a good dude.

470
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:21,180
I'll connect you guys.
I think it's a,

471
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:27,020
probably one of the least trained aspects
of fighting is the mental aspect of

472
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:32,670
it. You know, you realize how good
guys are just by watching them train,

473
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,590
you see them spar, you see them
do all these things. Y'All have,

474
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,760
Tammy's got this guy's fucking good,
this guy's got great Jujitsu Guy,

475
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,360
great kickboxing. You ever hear
about the people that like they're,

476
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:45,630
they're saying's, right? Like,
man, that guy's amazing in the gym,

477
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:46,800
but when he shows up to fight it,

478
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:50,550
like he just doesn't put on like I've
been that guy multiple times. And like,

479
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,620
yeah, a lot of it has to
do with mentally. Yeah.

480
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:56,250
That's almost like an unaddressed
giant chunk of the puzzle.

481
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:59,280
Like a third of the puzzle I grew,
it was a pie.

482
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,880
A third is keep it
together. You know, like,

483
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:08,040
you know when it's ready to go
and now and it's all happening,

484
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:11,460
don't freak out. And you
never like, here's kind of
something that I think about.

485
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:15,540
You never know everybody's situation,
right? So the day before the fight,

486
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:18,630
we have weigh ins and then Dana comes back
and like, he gives us this, our speech,

487
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:23,310
right? So everyone there, you don't know
what life position they're in, you know?

488
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,460
So it's like, hey, there's a
potential, we can get a bonus.

489
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:30,540
So all those guys are affected emotionally
somehow. Yeah. You know what I mean?

490
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,730
Some guys, maybe they don't
care. Some guys, maybe they do,

491
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,740
but then like we walk out and then
there's a crowd, 15,000 people sold out.

492
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:42,100
Look around. We got Joe Rogan
sitting here, we got Mick
Maynard. Say We got Dana.

493
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,970
Why we got everybody sitting around
and then like, we're still human too.

494
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:48,460
So we're thinking like, this is
kind of like a test, you know?

495
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:52,720
It's like we got all the, we got the
whole board right here in front of me,

496
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:56,950
ready to take my test. You know,
like, yeah, it really depends on like,

497
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,250
there's so much that goes into it.
Like mentally,

498
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:02,950
you gotta be prepared for a lot of
things or some guys block it out,

499
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:03,970
but it's just like,

500
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:08,890
like anything else you had to know
about halfway into the first round,

501
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,210
some special shit was happening
though on this fight. Yes. Uh,

502
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,770
after, so after the first
round, I was very happy.

503
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,120
I sat down and my coaches were like,
okay, this is good. This is good.

504
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,520
You're doing this. And I was like,
listen, I don't want to know what's good,

505
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:26,920
what should I expect the next round.
Like I was ready to go.

506
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,410
I told us straight to George,
I'm like, dude, I don't care.

507
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,010
What do I need to do next? What
should I prepare for? And he's like,

508
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,330
prepare for a little bit more pressure.

509
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,610
He's probably going to try to shoot for
the take down this route. And I was like,

510
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:40,410
okay, cool. So that, I was just looking
for that and using my tools to kind of,

511
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,090
to just prepare for that. But, uh,

512
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,880
definitely midway through the
second round I was like, okay,

513
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,630
like I know he's still got a lot of power,
all this stuff,

514
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:54,100
but I think that that leg, I
should be able to, you know,

515
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:58,780
buy some time and take away a little bit
of damage, like coming at me forever.

516
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,980
He mean he had to be an agony and he
never stopped coming. Yeah. I mean,

517
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,370
like he didn't wince at all, like
even on the cage when I was just like,

518
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:09,130
when he was on the back and I was trying
to kick his leg, he just, his face,

519
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,240
his facial expression never change.
Fucking savage man. That's crazy.

520
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,140
He's a bad man. Respect that guy.
Yeah, for sure. For sure. For sure.

521
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,970
Even before, like even before
the fight. Before and after.
Yeah, for sure. Yeah. No,

522
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,100
maybe even more so man, not everybody
can do that. Not Everybody can take that,

523
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:31,120
you know? And to do it the way he did it
with 100%, it was a character in tact.

524
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,300
Never shirked never shied away from it.
Kept moving forward.

525
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,660
That's a dangerous person and he's
still getting better. Oh yeah.

526
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Hell that guys just getting better.
Oh yeah. When you were doing,

527
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,910
how much do you think
the hypnosis helped you?

528
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,580
A really good amount, man.
How much different did you
feel like in what way? Um,

529
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,110
I just, I felt more clear. I'm,

530
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,740
I feel like a lot of times I can be just
kind of like an anxious guy. I just,

531
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,930
I feel like I feel a lot of just
energy, the kind of like, I don't know,

532
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,530
I go into a room and I'm
just like, eh. So having,

533
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,810
having the focus on having my intention
set on what I wanted to happen

534
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,763
was

535
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,640
70% like I know 70% of like the hypnotism,

536
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:22,100
all that stuff to just help me
to keep my thoughts on track.

537
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,000
Something never fall back onto every
single time if I felt like I was getting

538
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:30,190
distracted or getting nervous or
whatever, I would remember, you know,

539
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:34,390
the things that we went over and the
hypnotism and so every time just kind of

540
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:37,220
like the hit that reset button
or just a delete button on,

541
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,310
on thoughts that I just didn't want to
have or that would make me feel anything

542
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,320
other than happy and ready to go.

543
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,430
Now how often do you practice is
to practices outside of hypnosis?

544
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:50,150
Is there like some things you
concentrate on or meditate on? Yeah. So

545
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,780
I do my best to just,

546
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,920
it's Kinda like the weird thing about
me is fighting is something that is just

547
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:04,380
kind of happened by accident, but it's
caused me to search for so much peace,

548
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:09,030
like inner peace because of everything
that I go through emotionally being a

549
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:13,440
fighter. So going from this,
I know Shab told you about it,

550
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:17,490
but going from this kid who was just
like super overweight my whole life,

551
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,050
never fit in with anybody, I was always
just like this introverted, Gothic,

552
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,110
weird kid that nobody,
you know,

553
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,150
nobody ever talked to Dee
never even wanted to fight.

554
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,070
I've always been nonconfrontational,

555
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:35,150
but somewhere in the journey
of becoming a fighter,

556
00:33:35,371 --> 00:33:37,830
I was like, ah, this is cool,

557
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,680
but I need to find more
peace because this is like,

558
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:45,300
it's bringing up way too much,
just like,

559
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,360
just way too much. My, of my
anger kind of like, you know,

560
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:52,530
from everything that I held onto.
So, uh, practice meditation,

561
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,340
a lot of meditation. I read a lot of
different, I'll study different religions,

562
00:33:56,341 --> 00:33:58,530
whatever, wherever on that. Um,

563
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,520
all just to find peace,
man, confrontational guy,

564
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,130
wind up being an elite cage fighter.

565
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:11,910
Stop and thinking about what I know.
Yeah. It's, that's a very strong,

566
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:12,710
still trying to wrap

567
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,010
my mind around it, but I think that, um,

568
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:21,260
internally there's just a lot of,
there's a lot of expression for me it's a,

569
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:24,260
it is a big expression man.
It's an expression of just

570
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,500
my, my danger, my ferociousness
this, the, the, the,

571
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,190
the part of myself that I've
always held back. You know,

572
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:38,990
it's like I have to hold back. I'm, I'm a
big guy, you know, like I, if I get angry,

573
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:42,260
I'm afraid I can, you know, break
something and you're like, you know what?

574
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:44,690
It's like, it's crazy. So fighting for me,

575
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:47,870
like when I trained after training,

576
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,380
I'm super peaceful right after I fight,
I feel like I've grown.

577
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,990
I feel like this guy is trying to hurt
me. All these things, like it's, it's,

578
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:57,080
it's just a place where
we both agree like, Hey,

579
00:34:57,081 --> 00:35:01,010
I'll give you my strength versus your
strength or whatever. Whatever power

580
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,460
is that strength is what we meet in the
middle. And so it helps me balance, man.

581
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,050
It does. Yeah. Because when I'm not
fighting, I'm, I'm so relaxed. It's crazy.

582
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:15,570
We'd make sense. And I think that
something that could aid a lot of men.

583
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,120
I think just at least training,
just a spa.

584
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,630
I think there's something particularly
soothing about hitting a heavy bag.

585
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,630
There's something particular
like when you're done, man,

586
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,140
you feel so good when you're done
hitting pads. We've done sparring.

587
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,320
You feel so just peaceful.
Yeah. You've got it all out.

588
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:33,030
You don't have anything
left in your mouth.

589
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,700
A lot of men carry a lot of
extra bullshit. Yeah, man.

590
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,750
A lot of dashes extra for no reason.
You got to let it out.

591
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,040
Let it out. Yeah. Some guys will
build it up in the gym. Right.

592
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,640
And they're super huge and it's like,
hey, you gotta let it out. Right.

593
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,150
They gave him swing those
arms. We didn't do it. Yeah.

594
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:55,770
You see less of that now too, it
seems like, but you know, it just,

595
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,970
it would be nice if,

596
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,270
I really think they should teach kids
how to fight at a very early age.

597
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,970
That'd be cool. I think it's the opposite.
It would have the opposite effect.

598
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,300
I think people would fight less.
I think if you taught kids how to fight,

599
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:10,650
they would just train and spar and they
would get it all out of their system

600
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,570
there and they'd probably
fight a lot less. It's an,

601
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:16,180
it's kind of like in our
nature, right? Like everybody,

602
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,790
everybody's kind of like a curiosity.
Like I wonder what it's like. Yeah.

603
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,680
The closest they have to
it is the wrestling team.

604
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,930
You can join the wrestling team and they,

605
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,200
they will teach you a very important
part of fighting. But other than that,

606
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,120
like they're not going to teach
you how to fight, but wrestling,

607
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,670
he's kind of like,
now at least it's kind of a loophole.

608
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,440
Like they don't teach
boxing in high school,

609
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,860
but they'll teach you how to wrestle
and that they're pretty crazy man.

610
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,440
And wrestling is getting rough. He seems
like, fuck yeah, yeah, yeah. I will swell.

611
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,740
The high school kids are savages.

612
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:46,410
I remember being a high school kid
and the high school wrestling room,

613
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:47,244
it was awful.

614
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,340
And those kids were trying to kill each
other and they work on the hardest to

615
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,010
running with plates over
their head and all that stuff.

616
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,440
And football teams just lifting
weights and running practice.

617
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:57,210
Those guys are doing ridiculous shit.

618
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,630
Slaven everybody's seen that move vision
quest, right? No, I've never seen it.

619
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,930
Never saw it. I've never seen it. Dude.

620
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:08,970
Oh it's Matthew Modine and Matthew Modine
plays this bad ass wrestler and he's

621
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:12,330
going up against this dude who's just
other bad ass wrestler and he comes to

622
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:16,200
visit the guy while the guys training
and this dude's got a log on his back and

623
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:20,490
he's walking up stadium
stairs and then he says,

624
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:21,600
you think you make the weight?

625
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,210
Cause he Matthew Modine's character
should have cut weight. And he goes,

626
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,330
I hope so. I hope so too. And
he keeps walking up the stairs.

627
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:31,110
Like when did this come
out? A long time ago, man.

628
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:34,650
Back when Madonna was young.
Oh cause that's the restaurant.

629
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,900
So He's walking up the stadium
stairs carrying a fucking log on.

630
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,550
It's a great movie, man. Every wrestler
that I knew when I was in high school.

631
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,340
Everyone worshiped this movie.
What year did the shit come out?

632
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:53,970
It's probably like 85 or so. That's
not the cover for it. Is it 85 Bam.

633
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:56,700
I nailed it, son. Is that
the cover for it? Yes.

634
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,370
You have anything to do with a wrestler?

635
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,580
I definitely would not click that
on Netflix thinking and I was around

636
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,770
restaurant movie at all.

637
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:08,340
She was hot as the sun to fun times,
but yeah,

638
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:12,180
that was like the quintessential wrestling
movie because he just was dedicated

639
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:15,880
and then it was his friend who lied
about being native American. Oh,

640
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,591
is that what that is?

641
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:19,320
I'm going to say what's that vest he's
got going and just wanted to be different.

642
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,690
Stand out. But it was a,
it was a fun movie, man.

643
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,380
It's so fun movie to get
into that for sure. Yeah.

644
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,540
Not a whole lot of movies about wrestling.
That's the least glamorous,

645
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:31,110
but probably toughest sport for high
school kids to get into. Definitely.

646
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:34,530
You know, that's why I stayed away
from him. You know, I tried out for,

647
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:36,250
I tried out for volleyball in high school,

648
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,900
actually made the team, but my grades
were terrible so I never got to play.

649
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,210
But I was like heavyset dude.
And I tried out. I made it.

650
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,740
I think it was just kind
of like a joke though.

651
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:47,020
I think the coaches were just
messing with me and my friends too.

652
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,000
When did you get involved in martial
arts? Uh, when I was 20, so 2010.

653
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:57,400
So it really quick.
Right after high school I started,

654
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,960
um, I started traveling. So
I used to play in a band.

655
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:06,460
I used to play a mini bands and willing
guitar. I play guitar, I play drums,

656
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:10,090
I play keyboard,
a little bit of everything.

657
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,320
Every Christmas my mom would just know
that just get me a new instrument and I

658
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:16,990
had locked myself in my room
and teach myself how to play.

659
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,280
And that's just always how like music
was my first love, my first love.

660
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,160
So I taught yourself.
Yeah,

661
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:29,190
I would just put on headphones and I
would just match the sounds and then keep

662
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,000
restarting the songs over and over again.

663
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,620
And then if it were like a keyboard song,

664
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:36,400
I'd play it like just on
the CD player and you know,

665
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,390
as it evolved and for
some reason I can just,

666
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,930
I can match tunes with
whatever instrument it may be.

667
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:47,320
You've always been able to do
that since a kid. Wow. Yeah.

668
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,920
So no formal training.
Nothing. That's great.

669
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,640
I've tried to take, I've tried to
take guitar lessons before, um,

670
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,540
but it didn't work for me and my mom
was just wasting your money like I was

671
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:01,450
learning, but it was kind of like
school for me. Like I had a teacher,

672
00:40:01,451 --> 00:40:04,200
he saw me okay, this court and this
court and I was like, God, like,

673
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,530
just let me feel it. Like I gotta I gotta
feel it. You know, like I can hear it,

674
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,740
I can, I can feel it, I'll get
it. And so I stopped going.

675
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:15,130
But how many people do it
like, like that? I'm not sure.

676
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,920
I know there's a lot of people that
can just kind of play by ear, but,

677
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,780
so I'll like,
I just love instruments.

678
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,440
I'll pick anything up and
just start playing it and
ended up teaching myself how

679
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:26,290
to play drums,
bass guitar keyboard.

680
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:30,940
I played the standup Bass
and uh, in middle school, um,

681
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,870
I've got like a little home production,
like beats studio at home, all that stuff.

682
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:38,110
So after high school I
started touring and uh,

683
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,290
that's when like I started
getting my heaviest.

684
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:46,180
We were eating fast food every single
day, three times a day, never drank water,

685
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,171
soda,

686
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:51,160
only smoking like a pack and a half of
cigarettes a day and just on the road

687
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:55,690
traveling. And then, uh, by
19, I got up to 305 pounds,

688
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,370
19 years old.

689
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:01,360
And I remember one night laying down
to go to bed and I just felt my heart

690
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:05,500
pumping ridiculously and I was
just like, no way. This like,

691
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:09,220
I think I'm going to die.
And like I woke up in a panic and

692
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,020
weird thing is I got up and I went
outside for maybe like 10 minutes and I

693
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:18,850
smoked another cigarette and I was
just like, this is the problem. Like,

694
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:24,120
I'm coughing up stuff my hardest going
to give out and I'm only 19 years old,

695
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:24,821
you know?

696
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:29,650
So around that same week is when
I discovered MMA with my brother,

697
00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:32,830
just like watching ultimate
fighter on TV. And so, uh,

698
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,380
I went on my last tour and
uh, I told the guys like, Hey,

699
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,990
I'm going to go train him and made it
look, oh, you're going to be a fighter,

700
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:42,200
like you think, you know? And I was just
like, I don't know what I'm going to be,

701
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:44,810
but I'm going to go train and get
healthy. And they're like, okay, cool.

702
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,760
We'll see you in a couple of
months. You know what I mean? Like,

703
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:49,910
no one really believed that I was going
to go and actually train and fight.

704
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:53,420
I told you, I said, well,
he's been like this big quiet
nonconfrontational guys. So,

705
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,790
um,
yeah,

706
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:00,140
I went and took my first class
Moyie Thai and March 1st,

707
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:05,140
2010 it took my first Moy Tai class and
then after like a month of doing Muay

708
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,760
Thai,
I started to see progression.

709
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:10,130
I started to see like my face
was slimming down all this stuff.

710
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:13,580
So it gave me motivation to
keep going. And then, um,

711
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,450
I remember going to a MMA event amateur,

712
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,870
and I saw really big heavyweight
guys going at it. So I was like, ah,

713
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:25,070
I think I want to do it. I want to give it
a shot. And uh, some of my coaches like,

714
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:28,280
okay, if you lose a hundred pounds,
I'll like, I'll find you a fight.

715
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,750
And I was like, a hundred
pounds. He's like, yeah,

716
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:32,940
I'll find you a fight if you
lose a hundred pounds. So, um,

717
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,960
I just kept training within 11 months,
lost a hundred pounds,

718
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,820
and then took my first fight.

719
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,940
And then she got like every fight has
been until now because it's like now I

720
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:47,780
have like more of a drive and a passion
for it, but all the way up until then,

721
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:51,580
everything kind of happened. By
coincidence. They're just like, I just,

722
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,880
I didn't really want to fight, but I had
a lot of people like, oh, you're so good.

723
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:57,650
Like keep doing it.
And I was a first time in my life.

724
00:42:57,651 --> 00:43:02,651
I've ever had people supporting me to
like really do something that was big and

725
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:08,600
I was a new guy and I was in shape and I
can, you know, girls are noticing me now.

726
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,800
I'm like all either my whole life
changed within a year of training MMA,

727
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:17,300
like wow. From going to this
guy that nobody even paid
attention to, to just like,

728
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:20,630
oh hey, how's it going? Are you
know, like, oh, you're so in shape.

729
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:24,290
And I was just like, oh, this
is weird. It's still weird.
It's only been nine years,

730
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,880
eight years, you know? So everything
is still very new to me. I've only,

731
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,500
my first day stepping on the mat
was like, you know, nine years ago.

732
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,510
Dude, that's an amazing story. It's crazy.
That's like a legit success story. Yeah.

733
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:43,160
You know, it says that you will get a
ridiculous ring tone. Do you have sir?

734
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,350
Is that so I thought I turned it off.
What is that?

735
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,650
It's just like stock iPhone,
Apple Rico.

736
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,900
You ventured into the options? Yes, sir.

737
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,740
Um, so yeah, that's like, that's
kind of how everything started.

738
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,870
And then with three,
five,

739
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:07,040
three or four fights and then I tried out
for the ultimate fighter so I had like

740
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:11,780
three or four fights in one year of
being a pro and a and then the ultimate

741
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:14,810
fighter trials came out and I like tried
off of that and made it on and I was

742
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:19,070
like, Oh shit. So most of my career
has been in the UFC. Wow. Yeah.

743
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,340
Is that like when you hear about fighters?
Uh,

744
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:26,300
particularly boxers you hear like a really
well managed boxer will get fights to

745
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:29,990
test them but with a guy that you could
beat and you learn it in a different

746
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:32,130
thing from each different fighter as

747
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,690
you move up the ladder and way more of
them are undefeated when they finally get

748
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,750
a shot at either a title
or a top contender,

749
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:45,260
but an MMA you could be fighting the top
level guys within a couple of years of

750
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:49,530
joining and he could honestly be a
couple of years prior to that if you're

751
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:52,830
particularly talented where you
picked up martial arts like in Ghana,

752
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,230
perfect example. Perfect.
Francis and gone.

753
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:59,220
It was like an incredible example because
he's really only done and then a for

754
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:03,990
five years and he's still right
now the scariest guy in that cage.

755
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,160
When he act, when he's throwing
bombs away, it's like you just,

756
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,960
you just let go hook up.

757
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:14,060
When he knocked out Overeem that was a
UN un that was an unheard of knock out.

758
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:18,810
Yeah. I sparred with him and like
in preparation for that fight, oof.

759
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,420
And I actually almost got hit with that
same punch. But yeah, we went, Frances,

760
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:27,470
I and I went three rounds in the cage
and then I remember a forest was there

761
00:45:27,961 --> 00:45:32,190
and, and, and John, the head coach of
syndicate and uh, they were like, okay,

762
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:34,920
you guys tone it down because we were
going at it and I'd be like, oh, it's fun.

763
00:45:34,921 --> 00:45:39,750
Like I like to go hard, but um, how often
though, how often? I like to go hard.

764
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,610
Yeah. Every now and then. Yeah.
Every time to mostly technical.

765
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:48,870
Yeah. So like entirely right now
it's like everyday technical,

766
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:52,470
one day sparring or one or two day
sparring. And when you say sparring, MMA,

767
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:53,910
sparring, sparring. Yeah.

768
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,620
And then the other days are just like
technical grapping grappling and technical

769
00:45:58,621 --> 00:46:01,810
striking and then, you know,
wrestling and then uh, yeah,

770
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,730
well spot on Fridays now
when they break it up. Um,

771
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,810
did you have someone who makes your
schedule for you? Like for the week,

772
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:12,330
do you have all your training routines?
Like what,

773
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:16,950
what your schedule set up for
morning, evening. Do you have that?

774
00:46:16,951 --> 00:46:21,090
Yeah. So advance. So they
had like, so for instance,

775
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:25,310
like the gym has a schedule of
all the classes, but um, the,

776
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,840
the head MMA coach George
would help me out. Like, Hey,

777
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,850
if you're getting ready for a fight,
show up to these,

778
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:33,810
these and these and I'll help you. And
almost like a curriculum. Yeah, yeah,

779
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:37,290
exactly. So that actually helped.
And the cool thing about it is like,

780
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,270
everything was in line.

781
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:41,730
So like whatever I worked with
him personally in the morning,

782
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,880
we'd still be going over and practice
and even in the night practice,

783
00:46:44,881 --> 00:46:47,460
so getting the same
things, like, you know,

784
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:51,090
multiple times a day instead of just one
time and then you'll get it again later.

785
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,140
Yeah.
And when you're your training over there,

786
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:59,520
you said you like 50 to 60 professionals.

787
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:03,750
I've seen so many guys on the
mat. Yeah. And I'd say on a very,

788
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:08,190
very low day,
20 like so many people,

789
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:10,050
so many people, guys and girls, man.

790
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,130
And how much your time are you
spending striking versus grappling?

791
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,800
Do you specialize in one
thing or the other? Well,

792
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,710
I can train grappling all
day and never get bored.

793
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,250
And like even if I'm tired
I can still do it. Um,

794
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,800
but then like grappling, I do it a
lot of the times because I like it,

795
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:33,190
but it's mandatory and it's, and
it's my job, so I like, okay,

796
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,800
I'm going to go to grapple and class.
But um,

797
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,700
it seems like it's an even balance,

798
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:42,190
but I love to go to striking
more because it's just like,

799
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,400
that's my favorite thing. Um, yeah.

800
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:50,401
So one striking class
one grappa and class one,

801
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,870
him and may class all in
one day type of thing.

802
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,070
So like two hours a piece
and then conditioning and
running and all that stuff

803
00:47:57,071 --> 00:48:01,470
in the Middle East. That's one
whole day. Yeah. Jesus. Yeah. Well,

804
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:05,320
the MMA classes more like,
so there's a class of MMA,

805
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:10,350
one personal going over like my specific
things that I like to work on and want

806
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:14,170
to work on. And then maybe
whoever's mimicking the opponent.

807
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,900
And then in the morning,
Moy, Tai, some. For me,

808
00:48:16,901 --> 00:48:20,470
it's always great to start the morning
off with more Moitai wake up first thing,

809
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:24,730
have coffee, do my five,
sixK run, train way,

810
00:48:24,731 --> 00:48:27,460
tie for two hours, eat, go do

811
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:34,020
MMA personal and then do the MMA class
at the end and then go relax after that

812
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:38,190
routine for me can work every day.
And he does. Everything's disciplined.

813
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,550
Like to do the same thing every
day is very common in Thailand.

814
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,490
And I think that that's why
I was able to put that, um,

815
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,090
that performance on and use that many
kicks because we throw so many in one day,

816
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,390
you know what I mean? What's different
about the training then? There's not,

817
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,760
there's not really class.
It's like for MMA,

818
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:01,670
there's not much talking and tie and
Moitai there's no talking, you know,

819
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:06,690
it's like they tell you what to do a
little bit like Punchkick knee deep five

820
00:49:06,741 --> 00:49:08,270
times, 10 times, 20 times, you know,

821
00:49:08,271 --> 00:49:12,470
like it's a lot of repetition and the
same thing in the, in the MMA class,

822
00:49:12,471 --> 00:49:14,150
George gives us a lot of um,

823
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,460
time to drill and drill out our own pace
and things like that before we go live.

824
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,960
And I think that that's what's
helped me the most, is less talking,

825
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,920
more drilling, show me one or two
things were mixed martial artists.

826
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:30,970
We're going to create something
off of it. It's okay. And um,

827
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:35,300
and just let us drill it. Let us drill
it, walk around co correct if you need to,

828
00:49:35,301 --> 00:49:38,780
but I think people need to spend
more time drilling on the mat,

829
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,900
go live every now and then just
so you can feel what you're at.

830
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,560
But the only way you're going to get good
is by drilling. It has just not as fun.

831
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,730
Exactly. It's training. I don't
think training should be fun.

832
00:49:49,731 --> 00:49:52,460
You could tell a dog to sit a hundred
times, you got to give him something like,

833
00:49:52,461 --> 00:49:55,310
you know, some type of
treats, the promise, certain
parts of training our fund.

834
00:49:55,311 --> 00:49:58,250
Right. Which is probably one of the
reasons why you like striking. Exactly.

835
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,750
It's fun. That part for me. I can
just, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's um,

836
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,040
it's,

837
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:09,040
I really believed that psychologists
should study fighters study high level

838
00:50:09,141 --> 00:50:10,060
fighters had,

839
00:50:10,061 --> 00:50:13,280
try to figure out what makes them tick
because there's all these different

840
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:14,900
versions.
You're a different version.

841
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:19,430
You the 300 pound God had sides lose all
this weight and now you one of the best

842
00:50:19,431 --> 00:50:24,230
fighters in the 205 pound division.
And it's crazy, man. I mean, that's a,

843
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:28,370
that's a wild story at be really cool
though. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe you'll get one.

844
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:32,990
Psychology studies on fighters is almost
mandatory because there's certain guys

845
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:36,410
that like, they're just impenetrable.
You know, there's certain guys that just,

846
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:40,940
they just like could beep the
Zim. Penetrable yeah. Like
you're not the more shit.

847
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:43,910
You talk more. He's gonna fuck
you up when he gets a hold of you.

848
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,790
Like it's not working, man.
It's not getting in there.

849
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,740
And then there's certain guys that like,

850
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:53,390
sometimes they're hot and sometimes
they get rattled and you know, it's,

851
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:58,190
it's a crazy endeavor what you guys do. It
really is. Yeah, it definitely has been.

852
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:02,760
I think a documentary or something
would be really cool too. Yeah.

853
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:07,190
I think a lot of people in the fans need
to see kind of a little bit more of the

854
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:10,700
inside, the real stuff, you know?
Yeah. The, the, the real stuff.

855
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:15,320
Like one of the craziest responses that
I've been getting lately is people have

856
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:18,500
hit me up on Instagram and like,
I can't believe you're just a normal guy.

857
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:22,250
Like you're posting songs and, and you
know, like doing all that, I'm like, yeah,

858
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:24,170
I'm,
I'm a human just like everybody else.

859
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:26,510
Like I think a lot of
fans kind of forget that.

860
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:30,020
I think we as fight or
sometimes forget to like, hey,

861
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:33,330
like for a little bit you can shut
it off and get normal. You know,

862
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:38,480
it's uh, I mean the, the balancing act is,

863
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:41,350
it's a strange thing to ignore,
you know,

864
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,830
the balancing act that a
fighter has to have with their,

865
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:47,870
their personality with training and
competing and then just being a normal

866
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:52,040
person and the highs and the lows and
managing all the stress of an upcoming

867
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:55,760
fight. And you just sort of asked to
go it on your own like, hey, good luck.

868
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,380
Keep your shit together.
Yeah.

869
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:01,700
And the face of flying fists and it sucks
too because the higher we go up then

870
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:05,660
it's just like, it's Kinda hard
to go anywhere behind. Right.

871
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:08,840
It's like we're working to get to the
top as fighters and when we want to be

872
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,550
known and, and but like
the more, the more,

873
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:14,630
the higher that we go,

874
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,610
the more like obligations media people
want to talk to you, all this stuff.

875
00:52:17,611 --> 00:52:21,740
So your time kind of gets short. I was
thinking about it last time, like damn,

876
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:26,530
like getting to the tops going to
kind of suck media like, you know,

877
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:30,320
media week or fight week
for everybody at the top.

878
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:33,200
They're like press conference,
this, that, that. And I'm,

879
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,360
I'm the type of guy where
like just like relaxed,

880
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:39,620
so I'll definitely need like
a psychologist or something
that helped me out with

881
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:42,590
me more hypnotism for sure.
I would,

882
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:47,480
I don't know how much they do at the UFC
performance institute and t for as far

883
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:50,310
as mindset training. Do they
do any of that over there? Um,

884
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:53,270
not that I'm this guy that I've
seen when that place is insane.

885
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:57,270
If you have chance to train there at all.
I did it. I did to fight camps there. Oh,

886
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:01,220
when I used to live in Vegas. Yeah.
And it, it's amazing. It's crazy play.

887
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:03,980
It was like,
it was like a little too good for me.

888
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:06,380
Like I started feeling like a little
bit spoiled, you know what I mean?

889
00:53:06,381 --> 00:53:07,850
I was like,
I got to go right out in the street.

890
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,340
Like I can't run out of
these nice treadmills, Moon.

891
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:15,430
I mean to have a place like that where
the company creates this super high level

892
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:18,770
training environment that there's not
another gym like it on the planet earth,

893
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,550
on the planet. So I just decided like,
hey, go ahead and work out there for free.

894
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,980
Seriously. It's pretty, oh, you want a
protein shake? Okay. Want the food? Like

895
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,800
whatever you need, just
live here. Yeah, it's, look,

896
00:53:28,801 --> 00:53:33,000
it's a great way to keep guys on track
with their weight cuts to, you know,

897
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,260
I'm very informational that place. Like
they, they've taught me so much. Yes.

898
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:41,400
You know, just about recovery
and what to do afterward.

899
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,420
Um, you know, they're,

900
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:46,740
they're investing a lot in just like
different programs for us to take home so

901
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:51,060
that we can make sure that, um, like our
nervous system is good for the next day.

902
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:55,950
Like they're putting so much stuff into
figuring out how to help the fighters.

903
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:00,300
You know what? I was tripped out by man
that uh, that underwater treadmill. Jamey,

904
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:03,450
isn't it an amazing, did you want on it?
No, I didn't know how you got to do it.

905
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:06,170
It's sick. I was, I was wearing my
clothes. I wasn't going to jump in there,

906
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:10,040
but I was like, what? Look at this is
crazy. This thing. It's sick. Yeah.

907
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:13,440
I did it a few times. What does it
lose it good for your cardio? Uh, it's,

908
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,890
it's low impact on the joints, right?
So like it's all, yeah, you'll,

909
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:18,420
you'll get it real good cardio.

910
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:23,340
Really real good cardio push on it because
there's jets blowing at you and the

911
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:27,210
the truck terminals on the bottom.
So you're trying just to not,

912
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,360
you're running against the water.
Oh Wow.

913
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:34,380
And so like depending on how deep you
go, your arms, that's all resistance.

914
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,020
Oh show. You can go just waist
level and it's a little bit easier.

915
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:41,820
But the lower you go, the harder it is.
Wow. Cardio. Did you do the zero gravity?

916
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,050
I didn't do any of the things there.

917
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:47,160
I just looked at him that he just gave
you the door Chris and gave me the four

918
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:50,880
one one. Yeah, they've done a lot.
It, when's the last zero? Grab it.

919
00:54:50,881 --> 00:54:54,390
It's been awhile maybe.
Or what was the zero gravity.

920
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:59,010
So there's a treadmill and you put these
pants on and then you just zip into

921
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:01,800
this like you zip into it.
Oh, I did see them in the,

922
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:03,940
you turn it on and it
fills up with this air.

923
00:55:03,941 --> 00:55:08,910
And then you can run up to
like 10% of your body weight.

924
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:12,930
So you, it's just like, it's another
zero gravity, like the treadmill.

925
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:16,270
It's not low impact, low impact,
super low. And you can get all the,

926
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:21,710
so you're just like tippy toes just
like, oh, that's so weird. Yeah. Yeah.

927
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,570
That's really weird. Yeah. They
got a lot of cool stuff, man.

928
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:29,970
While they're at the forefront of all
recovery methods and training methods and

929
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:32,550
Tricia. Yeah. And you see what
they're doing for us on fight week.

930
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,240
What are they doing? So this last
fight, um, they were like, Hey,

931
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:38,950
do you want any help? Do you have your
meals prepped or anything of that?

932
00:55:38,951 --> 00:55:43,800
I was like, no, I don't. So
I guess for people that are
fighting within us for now,

933
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:48,470
um, they'll, they'll prep
and make everything for,

934
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,630
for fight week when you're cutting
weight and I'll make sure, wow.

935
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,740
Like you stay in contact with, with the
guys, Clinton, them, and they'll, uh,

936
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,830
check your weight and then they'll
make meals according to you.

937
00:55:58,831 --> 00:56:02,300
Like whatever you need, deliver them to
your room. That's understanding. It was,

938
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,320
it was the best.
And then the recovery afterwards,

939
00:56:04,321 --> 00:56:08,790
they give you these drinks all like
Usada approved, all that stuff.

940
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:10,410
It's like no problems.
They help,

941
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,070
they help so much with that last
weight cut and uh, and rehydration.

942
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,430
How much do you cut this fight?
I cut

943
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,920
1919 pounds and that's a lot.

944
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,800
Usually I usually cut
maybe four to seven pounds.

945
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,530
The last couple of fights I've just,
I would just coast it,

946
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:30,880
but when I went to Thailand,

947
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,130
there's a lot of sugar and a lot of
stuff that I was eating out there.

948
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:37,690
Is that really what it was?
Yeah,

949
00:56:37,691 --> 00:56:41,620
when I was in Bangkok for a long time
and it's just a lot of street food,

950
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:45,730
a lot of fried food and stuff.
And I was just there and I'm like,

951
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:48,040
I'm going to try everything.
So once I got to Pooh cat,

952
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,310
they actually have like health food stuff,
Vegan stuff.

953
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:53,710
They have a lot of tourists there.
So especially on the street.

954
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:58,540
So the street that Tiger's on all gyms,
it's like five or six crossfit gyms,

955
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:02,530
maybe 10 restaurants, health,
food, restaurants, everything.

956
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:07,090
So I was able to stay on track there. So
just, I was just back just a few weeks.

957
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:11,890
Yeah. But I still may weight,
so that's good. That's a
lot of weight to cut though.

958
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:16,000
Right? You like to cut look about five
or six is that what yeah, yeah, yeah.

959
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:18,430
No more than eight.
Like eight is pushing it for me.

960
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:21,790
So like what difference do you feel?
Uh,

961
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,170
the day after I didn't with their
rehydration method, I felt amazing.

962
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,590
Usually if we're cutting that much,
I'd feel a little bit bloated,

963
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,980
little heavy sleep, beer, all that stuff.
But this, when you, you're talking,

964
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:34,930
did you ever do ivy or
would you did do ivy? Yeah,

965
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:39,160
when I used to fight in the RFA and um,
at one 85, I used to fight and win 85.

966
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:43,990
Oh my God. Yeah, that's
ours. Oh, I used to cut from,

967
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:49,500
I tried to get as close to 200 as possible
and then cut the 15th super skinny,

968
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:53,380
200, two terrible. Oh, terrible.

969
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:56,520
I'm struggling to make two or five
[inaudible] not struggle, but like,

970
00:57:56,530 --> 00:58:01,240
it hurts to make two or five now. So I
couldn't even imagine like, oh it sucked.

971
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:04,270
So what would you think about if
they abandoned weight cutting?

972
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:09,850
Mm, they just opened up more weight
classes and abandoned week cutting.

973
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,770
I mean I wouldn't mind it. I
would, I would like to see that.

974
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,330
Do I think it would be
better for the fighters?

975
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,660
I think it'd be better for the fighters
and we'd see some really cool matchups

976
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:20,560
yeah.
You know what I mean?

977
00:58:20,561 --> 00:58:23,020
Cause there's some guys I cut a lot of
weight and there's some match ups that

978
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:24,940
would be really cool at,
at different weights too.

979
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:28,780
I think it's one of those dumb things
that's existed in the past and we never

980
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:31,750
corrected. I think, I
think we should stop it.

981
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:36,040
It's not helping anybody to lose weight
for a fight so that he could be fit and

982
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:39,340
in great shape. Yeah. Okay, sure.
But how do you go about that?

983
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:42,190
But I mean losing weight,
like losing weight and training,

984
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:47,080
not like massive dehydration for weight
cut day and then rehydration to the next

985
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,190
day for fight day.
I think it's,

986
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,700
it's a crazy strain that guys are doing
to their kidneys. And their bodies.

987
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,713
I mean,

988
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:56,620
many fighters have told me that they
don't feel like they can take a body shot

989
00:58:56,621 --> 00:59:01,090
as well when they cut a lot of
weight sometimes the your head,

990
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,920
my head, I remember on the Johnnie
Walker fight, I'd cut, excuse me,

991
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:08,380
it could have been from the Weight Cup,
but that morning,

992
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:13,590
like if I've been tapped on my jaw just
felt like my head was just like off like

993
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:15,230
randomly, you know? Yeah.

994
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:18,100
It felt very sensitive and he does from
the weight and the same night I get

995
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,050
knocked out.
I don't know what it was from,

996
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,710
but I remember that morning when I
woke up because usually I like a shake

997
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:27,710
everything off. I'll like, you know,
like punching myself in the jaw,

998
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:29,780
all that stuff just to
get ready for the fight.

999
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:33,440
And I remember that that morning when
I was like tapping myself on the jaw,

1000
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:37,760
my head just didn't feel right.
Dude. That's not a good feeling. No,

1001
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,880
but I got to checked after I didn't
have any like concussion or anything.

1002
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,780
Did you have some particularly
hard sparring session or
something close to that?

1003
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:50,060
Uh, I don't think close to
it during that camp. Uh,

1004
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,740
like I said, I didn't feel it all the
way until I didn't have it. The only,

1005
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,950
the only time I ever felt it
was like after the weight cuts.

1006
00:59:57,951 --> 01:00:00,050
So it could have been
from that. Right. Yeah.

1007
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:04,310
And I think that morning I actually ended
up cutting the last little bit of my

1008
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:07,790
weight, the morning of weigh ins
too, which is not usually like me.

1009
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:09,050
I'll usually cut it the night before.

1010
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,080
So you said you like to start
your day off with a run. Um,

1011
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,540
are you doing that every
day? Yeah, definitely.

1012
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,830
So that's one thing that I learned too
is just training every day. Not Learn,

1013
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:23,510
but it just feels different now I have
to go and train every day when I was in

1014
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:26,960
Vegas, like, oh, I got to drive 30
minutes, you know, all these things.

1015
01:00:26,961 --> 01:00:29,120
I had a lot of excuses to make up.

1016
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:32,240
And now with the convenience
of how training is now,

1017
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:36,470
I don't even make up excuses. I'm like, if
I'm tired, I still, it's two minute walk,

1018
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:39,770
get your ass to the gym. You
know? And so yeah, every,

1019
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:42,650
every single day training and
then weekends off for sure.

1020
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:44,150
So you're running every single day,

1021
01:00:44,151 --> 01:00:46,790
then you're training every single
day before Moitai it's mandatory.

1022
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:50,900
You run like the train, train, train and
we'll see. You run first. You show up,

1023
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,620
you run the day. The first
day I showed up, uh, at,

1024
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:58,340
at Tiger's Moy Thai class.
I didn't even have tennis shoes.

1025
01:00:58,341 --> 01:01:00,560
I just showed up with my flip flops
because I was staying right across the

1026
01:01:00,561 --> 01:01:04,400
street and I showed up. I start wrapping
my hands and the trainer, he's like,

1027
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:08,160
are you going to train? And I was like,
yeah, I think so. He's like, you think so?

1028
01:01:08,161 --> 01:01:11,910
We'll go run. And I was like, I don't
have shoes. I only have my flip flops.

1029
01:01:11,911 --> 01:01:16,190
And he's like just pointed like so go run.
And I had to run like,

1030
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:20,420
I think it was like eight kilometers in
flip flops before I can even train. Yeah.

1031
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,950
That's like four miles.
Yeah, right. Somewhere around
there. Five and a half. Yeah.

1032
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:28,340
It's like for like four miles, something
like that. We just had to run, run, run,

1033
01:01:28,341 --> 01:01:30,820
run, run, run. I asked the girl
was like, how long do we run? Four.

1034
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,680
She's like usually like five to six
kilometers or something like that. Yeah,

1035
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:38,030
it was like five ks. Like three and half.
Yeah. I'd say like just cutting it short.

1036
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:42,770
Five K wow. And in, in flip flops and
I was like, okay, cool. Yeah, I never,

1037
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:46,100
I never forgot my shoes again. I would
always show that that fuck your feet up.

1038
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:50,350
It wasn't too bad. Actual, no, cause I
wasn't wearing shoes a lot anyway. Oh yes.

1039
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,480
Thailand sometimes you had to take off
your shoes before he entered the store.

1040
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,540
So.
So they're,

1041
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:58,130
they're hard assed in their discipline
with the wanting you to get serious about

1042
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,500
it. Yeah, they're just serious about
it. They're like show respect, you know?

1043
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:04,700
And when you're running and you're
running with a group of guys or everybody,

1044
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:09,670
guys, girls, whoever shows up to
class. But is it is like, okay,

1045
01:02:09,671 --> 01:02:12,620
so that when they're running,
are they running like a organized,

1046
01:02:12,621 --> 01:02:14,230
like in a group or are they just,

1047
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:18,230
is everybody running a few miles
before class every time? The first,

1048
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,990
the first Moy Thai gym that I trained at
the straight Moitai. Hi Jim. In Bangkok,

1049
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:27,450
they run as a unit every
day 5:00 AM. Wow. As a team.

1050
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,120
They live at the gym, they eat of
the gym, they sleep in the gym.

1051
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,470
They are like,
they don't have homes there.

1052
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:39,270
Home is the gym and their job
is just fight and eat, sleep,
train, fight. That's it.

1053
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:43,440
It's crazy when they, they even take
on the name of the gym. Yeah, exactly.

1054
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,300
And that's a whole different life.

1055
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:50,330
Like that is what made me respect and
learn and love Moitai so much as how these

1056
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:53,490
guys trained in just, they lived
together, everything. It was amazing.

1057
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,180
So they run as a group,

1058
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,890
but the other like the other place
we all start off. But if you,

1059
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:02,520
if someone's laughing you and they
just want to run fast, like it's,

1060
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:07,530
it's totally fun. But before the
class everybody has to go. Yeah. Wow.

1061
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,030
That's a smart way to do it,
man.

1062
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:13,500
I mean if you could really convince
them to be conditioned all the time and

1063
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:15,540
there's no like you have no option.

1064
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:18,420
You can't be out of condition if you're
going to run five miles every day,

1065
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,180
no five miles. And then hitting, kicking,

1066
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:25,410
hitting and kicking pads for five to 10
rounds a day, clinching 45 minutes a day,

1067
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,710
like clenching at after every session.

1068
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:33,660
It's like you run knee bag, sit
ups, all that stuff. Second,

1069
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,730
second session is um,

1070
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:40,740
kicked the bag three to five rounds until
a trainer picks you up. Like for me,

1071
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:45,270
I had to wait for a trainer to actually
even like want to hold pads for me.

1072
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,770
If you just show up, you'll
just be hitting the bag
until the trainer was like,

1073
01:03:49,771 --> 01:03:51,360
Hey, okay, I'll hold for you.

1074
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:55,380
And then once you actually find a
trainer that wants to work with you,

1075
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:58,140
then you kind of,

1076
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:02,400
whatever their schedule is for you that
they'll create it though you'll hold,

1077
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,370
they'll hold pads, you'll kick
the bag, you'll do pushups.

1078
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:09,510
He'll do sit ups and then clench 30 to
45 minutes after and it's the same thing

1079
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:11,880
every single day.
Wow.

1080
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,550
Do you ever worry that this might be
something that would be monotonous because

1081
01:04:16,551 --> 01:04:17,580
he doing the same way every day?

1082
01:04:17,581 --> 01:04:21,750
Or did you think we just concentrate
on excellence? No, because it's also,

1083
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,590
uh, like going to the fights and
there's so many different styles.

1084
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:28,380
So like people are doing the same
thing every day. The repetition,

1085
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:32,400
but the styles are completely different.
You know,

1086
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:34,310
like nobody fights like
San Chai. Right, right.

1087
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,410
He does the same thing everybody else
does. But he has his own style. Yeah.

1088
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,540
You know what I mean?
Or some guys will do the same thing,

1089
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:41,670
but they don't even like to kick or knee.

1090
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:45,450
They just like to throw elbows and hell
plenty guys like that where they just

1091
01:04:45,451 --> 01:04:49,710
like, you know that when
he goes, he's just throwing
elbows all five rounds. Yeah.

1092
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:53,250
This guy's just going to
throw. Nice. So it's just like,

1093
01:04:53,251 --> 01:04:57,330
which tools do you use the beds? Like
are you a near, are you at a kicker?

1094
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,850
Are you an elbow guy? You left
cake, are you a low kicker?

1095
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,210
It's kind of like what's what
strikes are your are your thing.

1096
01:05:03,211 --> 01:05:06,810
And then you go watch the chaos and
these guys are getting split open every

1097
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:09,930
night fucking on the stretchers. They
take them stretchers on the ring, man.

1098
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:12,930
It's amazing. Wow. It's like
not to see someone get hurt,

1099
01:05:12,931 --> 01:05:17,040
but like just the fact that like these
guys are all out brawl in every night.

1100
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,630
Every single night there's a
fight at the stadium. Sure.

1101
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:23,890
Thursday nights are the nights that like
the like the higher guys go and they're

1102
01:05:23,891 --> 01:05:28,270
packed with people. Thousands of
people. Like the one I went to,

1103
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,820
there was a few thousand
people there for the stadium.

1104
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:34,530
It looked pack and
everyone's betting like Ah.

1105
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:38,920
And then when the kicks land I'm
like, oh hey. And the energy is crazy.

1106
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,210
They never showed up, man. I'm
getting hyped. Thinking about again,

1107
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:43,390
going back to Thailand right now,

1108
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:48,400
how did San Chai figure out how to do
more different than anybody? Ah Man,

1109
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:53,260
he's so interesting with as quick switches
of the feet and like even the way he

1110
01:05:53,261 --> 01:05:56,470
throws kicks is yet Skyler a little
different flavors, everything.

1111
01:05:56,471 --> 01:05:58,480
He doesn't think he can help it,
you know what I mean?

1112
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:02,020
There's just something about the
guy's character. It just like his,

1113
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:06,010
his fighting is him. Right. You know,
like he's just, he's kind of outgoing,

1114
01:06:06,011 --> 01:06:10,180
like this is a weird, funky guy and it
makes sense that he fights like that.

1115
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,840
You know what I mean? It's not like
he's just like serious, like stern guy,

1116
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:15,520
but then goes out there
and fights on crazy.

1117
01:06:15,521 --> 01:06:20,170
Like he seems like his fighting is
definitely an expression of himself.

1118
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:22,550
He's so good, man. Yeah. He's so good. I,

1119
01:06:22,551 --> 01:06:27,550
I like watching him just warm up sneakers
on outside sweat and thrown elbows and

1120
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:31,390
knees and everything. He's a bad
motherfucker, man. And he's, you know,

1121
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,920
he's not young. No, I think he's in
his forties is he? Yeah. Really? Yeah.

1122
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:40,810
Can we look,
help hold Sanchez 38 he's getting there.

1123
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,760
It's getting there. But
meanwhile, I was in his prime.

1124
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:46,000
He's still fighting people up all the
times a month, multiple times a month,

1125
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:49,570
have fight. Good luck that
shows this and like dynamite.

1126
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:52,210
This Instagram was awesome,
man.

1127
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:55,630
And he's got these great videos of
him warming up and you watch him,

1128
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,080
his movement, man. It's like, wow,
that guy's, he's something special.

1129
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:02,410
It takes a lot of fucking energy to
move around the way he does too. Yeah,

1130
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:04,540
I'm sure he still shows up to
the gym every single day to,

1131
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:06,640
she's like holding pads for
foreigners and all that stuff.

1132
01:07:06,641 --> 01:07:09,950
I stopped by y'all couch him. He
wasn't there. But I hear like there is,

1133
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,860
I look at that guy,
the fucking man right there.

1134
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,830
He just posted a video the
other day where this crazy wig

1135
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:20,730
go to CP. If I have video of him. There
it is right there. Look at this guy.

1136
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:23,183
Ah,

1137
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,550
even how he throws his Kik. It's
different. It's so different. Yeah.

1138
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,410
Like he doesn't really like turn all of
his upper body. Like a lot of them went.

1139
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:37,330
I've seen, right. He's, he's a volume guy,

1140
01:07:37,331 --> 01:07:41,950
but he knocks guys out with one shot to
look at that catch instinctual, you know,

1141
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:46,600
like he didn't even think about it. Didn't
even flinch. He's so jacked up swipe.

1142
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,171
It's interesting.

1143
01:07:50,171 --> 01:07:53,770
We think of how many different people
are doing it and that this one guy stands

1144
01:07:53,771 --> 01:07:56,380
out. I love outliers, man.

1145
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:00,850
So that's one thing that I learned
compared to like watching Moy Thai in the

1146
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:04,480
states and then going there at the amount
of kicks and knees at they're throwing,

1147
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:05,443
hmm,

1148
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:06,720
okay.

1149
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,750
I'm looking at fighting like, okay, like
what does the next punch going to happen?

1150
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,770
These guys thrown kick after
kick after kick for five rounds.

1151
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,250
I was like, okay, I'm, I'm

1152
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,890
definitely not kicking enough
so I got to start kicking.

1153
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,220
So I they like being in Thailand.
Definitely.

1154
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:24,460
I'll be to learn the
importance of kicking.

1155
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:28,340
So we were talking about the shoot
box style Hockfield Cordeiro who is

1156
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:32,930
absolutely one of the best
striking coaches on the planet.

1157
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,880
It's funny that he's such a nice guy
and he trained the most murderous crew.

1158
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:43,250
Angela
could not be nicer.

1159
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:48,620
They had Anderson Silva,
they had Vandelay and Vandelay shogun.

1160
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:53,510
Look at that photo. Yeah, dude,

1161
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:57,800
that's a fucking Timbo. Another
one. It's got like Pele. Everybody.

1162
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:59,810
That's where I said pay like two.

1163
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:04,730
They were so I'm the guy
who taught Michael Costa. He
was, he was from that same,

1164
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,360
that same group
to this day.

1165
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:11,540
Do not understand why more times not
more popular. I've never understood it.

1166
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,460
It's so exciting to watch.
Yes.

1167
01:09:13,461 --> 01:09:17,750
I was like if we had a league in America
that people understood who the fighters

1168
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:19,910
were,
got to know him and root for him and see,

1169
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,850
you know like you see with boxing with
Terrence Crawford, you know, he's like,

1170
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,210
is that this piece of prime right now?
You know, he's on top of the world.

1171
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:30,830
I want to see a guy like that in white
tie and I think it would be the same

1172
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:31,430
thing.

1173
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:34,760
I think Americans would jump on board
if they understood how exciting it is.

1174
01:09:34,761 --> 01:09:36,830
Yeah. You see a lot of, you see

1175
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:43,330
a good handful of foreigners and Americans
in Thailand to go watch Moy Tai and I

1176
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:47,780
thought the same thing like man, they
got to get this. Let's figure it out.

1177
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:51,350
Let's figure it out. What is
he missing? What's missing?

1178
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:56,180
Dana white has a good point to things
that culturally we won't accept kickboxing

1179
01:09:56,181 --> 01:10:00,850
after PKA karate from like the 1980s
remember before my time, but that's it.

1180
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:04,760
This town was born 90 it was guys would
throw like these little kicks so they

1181
01:10:04,761 --> 01:10:06,890
had to throw like eight kicks around,
you know,

1182
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:09,110
and then they would have
like a sloppy boxing match.

1183
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:11,930
Some of the time there's some really
good guys that fought in there too,

1184
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:16,931
like real high level guys like penny jet
or Kitezh Font Pka and you know a lot

1185
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:20,780
of like really, really
good strikers. But it was,

1186
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:25,760
there was nothing compelling
about it. Yeah, it just wasn't,

1187
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:28,070
it wasn't something that you
wanted to watch all the time,

1188
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:32,690
but if you could watch some of the best
Muay Thai fights that you've ever seen

1189
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:36,710
and you could watch them on television
just like it show people on television,

1190
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:40,010
some crazy wars that you and
I have seen from the past.

1191
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:43,640
Like how could you not like
that if you like striking.

1192
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,400
How could you not like guys who are
experts in bone smashing? They would.

1193
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:48,373
That's why

1194
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:54,320
I have a lot of love too for like I'm
a huge one championship pin. Me Too.

1195
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:57,140
I'm a huge one championship.
Yeah, I like what he's doing. I,

1196
01:10:57,141 --> 01:10:58,910
luckily he's mixing all
three of them together too.

1197
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,780
It's amazing because like you
can literally go to a fighting,

1198
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:06,560
see the good MMA match. You if you, if
you like grappling and file and striking,

1199
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:09,290
obviously,
and you can see legit Moy Thai fighters,

1200
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:12,800
like my friends from the stadiums
are fighting in Bangkok on the 10th.

1201
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:13,850
So like really

1202
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:18,030
like I can't wait because I really want
to get there by the 10th to go see this

1203
01:11:18,031 --> 01:11:22,980
one championship event in Bangkok. Wow.
That guy, one of my friends like pet.

1204
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:24,270
Damn. He's uh, he's a,

1205
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:29,670
a stadium like champion and he's fighting
one championship again. And it's like,

1206
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,850
it's, it's just sick to seaman. Yeah.

1207
01:11:31,851 --> 01:11:34,120
I don't think people understand how
big it is an Asian either. Well,

1208
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:38,000
there's a lot of American fans that are
just really, they're missing it. Yeah.

1209
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,570
It's like Asia Asia's version of the
UFC. It's gigantic vigor. Yeah. Yeah.

1210
01:11:42,571 --> 01:11:46,890
The numbers are insane. And they got
some fucking killers over there. Yes.

1211
01:11:46,891 --> 01:11:49,490
They got some legit killers.
Yeah.

1212
01:11:49,491 --> 01:11:53,550
That's like that Guy Nasty Ucan who
just knocked out a Eddie Alvarez. Yup.

1213
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,920
I tried to tiger dude,
that guy's legit. Yeah,

1214
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:01,680
I remember to train with him at
all. No, I would like alongside him.

1215
01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:05,210
I didn't personally try it with them,
but I remember one day we were doing a,

1216
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:10,230
we were training and he was the last one
on the mat. And uh, our wrestling coach,

1217
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:11,610
frank was like,
he's like,

1218
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:15,870
he said something like 10 more sprawls
and like you beat Eddie Alvarez or

1219
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:19,530
something and the guy's just grinded
like he's just digging himself into the

1220
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:23,580
Maddie. It was, it was cool to watch
him prepare for that fight. But there's,

1221
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:26,550
there's guys like that that's like,
yeah,

1222
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:30,660
he trains there all the time and he'd beat
Eddie Alvarez. Like that's a big deal.

1223
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,210
I think it's a big factor over there too,
that they don't cut weight.

1224
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,930
I think that's a big factor if you're
used to being the bigger fight or all the

1225
01:12:36,931 --> 01:12:40,680
time, and then all of sudden now you're
not now, no one's cutting any weight.

1226
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:42,810
I mean, they, they have
some sort of a system.

1227
01:12:42,811 --> 01:12:46,380
Ben Asked her and was explaining it to me.
I don't really remember how it works,

1228
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,250
but there's some sort of a system where
they stop you from white cutting. Yeah.

1229
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:51,480
Like they check your hydration,
check your hydration levels,

1230
01:12:51,481 --> 01:12:56,370
yet you gotta be a way to do it. That's
the right, he's correct. He's smart.

1231
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,070
It's the right way to do it. We should've
done it a long time ago in the UFC.

1232
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,880
I really think that all the
weight cut issues, all that
stuff, like ruining cards,

1233
01:13:02,881 --> 01:13:05,010
all that, it would all be
eliminated, right? Yes.

1234
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,530
Ruining cards and even more importantly,

1235
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:10,770
I think causing fighters to fight
it less than their full potential.

1236
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:14,070
How many fighters got hit when they
shouldn't have gotten hit because if they

1237
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:18,180
were recovered completely,
if they didn't have to a,

1238
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:22,050
not recover completely, but if they
didn't have to recover from a weight cut,

1239
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:22,921
I mean who knows?

1240
01:13:22,921 --> 01:13:26,850
Maybe there's shots you ate because that
you wouldn't have eaten. Yeah. Right.

1241
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:29,520
Especially if you were some guys
cut in a brutal amount of weight.

1242
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:33,060
It's entirely possible that you could get
hit with something you wouldn't if you

1243
01:13:33,061 --> 01:13:37,230
didn't have to cut weight. Yeah.
Right. We got five more often.

1244
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:42,180
The training would be a lot better
too because we wouldn't like a lot of

1245
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:44,280
fighters spending the last three weeks,

1246
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,260
four weeks of their fight or their
cap just trying to weight lose weight.

1247
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:53,620
It's the whole way that
project of learning and
building strength and all that

1248
01:13:53,731 --> 01:13:56,580
stuff that you could do. So I
dunno. I think it'd be awesome.

1249
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:59,970
The only argument for it is that the
guys are tough enough to do it and cut a

1250
01:13:59,971 --> 01:14:00,810
shitload of weight,

1251
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:04,680
have this massive size advantage and
sometimes it allows them to win and they

1252
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:07,230
think they should be able to do it because
they're tough enough to cut all that

1253
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:12,010
weight. Yeah, I get it. I mean it
does. It's hard to do. You have

1254
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,650
to be a strong person, but I just
don't think it's good for anybody.

1255
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,050
I don't think it's good for the athletes.
I don't think it's good for the sport.

1256
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:20,320
I don't think it's good for anybody.
It's just an old way.

1257
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,740
It's just an old thing that people are
doing so they don't have to fight the

1258
01:14:23,741 --> 01:14:24,551
bigger people.
You know?

1259
01:14:24,551 --> 01:14:27,580
It's crazy because I have to answer that
question a lot for people who don't,

1260
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:31,510
like, some of my friends are just
like, oh, like they'll hit me up like,

1261
01:14:31,511 --> 01:14:34,420
hey am I can't talk this week.
Like I got to cut weight.

1262
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:37,570
Like it's not a good time.
And they're like, how do you,

1263
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:41,500
how do you lose 20 pounds in a day
and why do you do that? You know?

1264
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:43,570
I'm just like,
I don't know how to explain it.

1265
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:46,810
It's just because that's what we
do. You know? There's not really,

1266
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:48,970
it's just what I have to do.

1267
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,910
When you see certain fighters get on
the scale though, like Conor Mcgregor,

1268
01:14:51,911 --> 01:14:55,330
when he made one 45 crazy,
looked like a,

1269
01:14:55,331 --> 01:14:59,590
like a Zombie mass walking dead character.
I was like,

1270
01:14:59,591 --> 01:15:03,810
Holy Shit Man. He looks like the ice king.
Yeah. What's that? No, the winter king.

1271
01:15:03,811 --> 01:15:07,870
He said, what do you call them? The, the
night came the nightclub, that night cake.

1272
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:11,290
He did look like the Nike. But did
you see him when he fought at, uh,

1273
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:15,440
when he fought Nate? Nate, that once Tony
look great, you look great. Right, right.

1274
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:20,760
There's a difference.
Yeah. I mean there's wow.

1275
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:26,480
Sane and happy right there.
He's just like, yeah, I just,

1276
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:30,520
I just had a burger. I know what to
sleep good. And then what's the math?

1277
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:33,710
The other one he's like, yeah dude,
he's on death's door right there.

1278
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:38,620
Only three months apart.
Four months apart for 2015 and March,

1279
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:42,490
2016 is that right? Wow. Wow.
You know what's crazy too?

1280
01:15:42,491 --> 01:15:45,940
Sometimes it's like weight cutting messes
up the mind to cause you see yourself

1281
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:48,130
so shredded,
right at one point in your life.

1282
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:52,090
And then like I can get maybe
like five pounds. I'm like,
ah man, I'm out of shape.

1283
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:56,190
I got to get back in shape. Yeah,
you get accustomed to it. Yeah. You,

1284
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:01,160
you'll never allow yourself to get back to
300 pounds can oh, never. No, no, no, no,

1285
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:05,250
no.
I can't go down that road yet.

1286
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:10,290
Crazy transition though to go in a 10
year span from being a guy who's like

1287
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:15,330
really overweight and worried you're going
to die to being an elite UFC fighter.

1288
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:19,780
Yeah. Like life life for me
is as is happening now. Like,

1289
01:16:19,781 --> 01:16:22,530
this is kind of the beginning of
everything for me. You know, it's,

1290
01:16:22,531 --> 01:16:23,380
it's really cool.

1291
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:28,350
It's really cool and I'm glad that I
found mixed martial arts just because it

1292
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:32,080
just, it gives me, it's a
journey man. It's not just,

1293
01:16:32,081 --> 01:16:36,820
UFC is just like finding MMA and diving
into different cultures and lifestyles

1294
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:41,320
and understandings and
sometimes philosophies, all
this stuff. Just to understand,

1295
01:16:41,321 --> 01:16:42,460
just to put it all together,

1296
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:47,300
just to have it all make sense
at the end of the day. Like it's,

1297
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:50,080
it's been a beautiful thing, man. I've
been able to meet a lot of people,

1298
01:16:50,081 --> 01:16:53,890
go a lot of places,
like I'm very thankful and very just like,

1299
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:58,480
like I'm okay with life, you
know? It's very good to hear, man.

1300
01:16:58,481 --> 01:17:02,860
That's a cool thing to hear. I love
hearing that. You're cool with life.

1301
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,910
Yeah. You're, um, you're on
a great path, man. It's a,

1302
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:11,920
it's also what's inspiring about it for
other people is your story of being at a

1303
01:17:13,011 --> 01:17:14,990
place where you weren't like that before.

1304
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:19,010
And then your story of being overweight
and smoking cigarettes and feeling like

1305
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:19,844
shit.

1306
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:24,800
And then now you're like for so many
people out there that gives people hope,

1307
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:29,780
it gives them a thought. Like maybe if I
just figure this out, I actually can't,

1308
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:32,510
maybe life doesn't suck.
Maybe just sucks the way I'm living.

1309
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:36,380
Maybe if I could just figure out
this path in a positive direction,

1310
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:41,600
I can change everything I can. I could be
a happy, I could be like you right now.

1311
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:45,610
What was the exact quote? I'm happy.
Happy with life. Happy with life. Yeah.

1312
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:49,250
You were cool with life. I'm happy
with life. That is a great quote.

1313
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:53,420
Most people don't get to that spot
and you know the crazy thing is too,

1314
01:17:53,421 --> 01:17:56,240
I didn't have this dream to be in the UFC.

1315
01:17:56,270 --> 01:18:00,680
I made a choice to just go get healthy.
You get me a short,

1316
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:03,680
just a short step in the
right direction and I just,

1317
01:18:03,681 --> 01:18:06,470
what propelled you to take the first
fight if you were just trying to get

1318
01:18:06,471 --> 01:18:07,304
healthy?

1319
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:13,060
A lot of encouragement and the
first time really hearing people

1320
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:16,743
like

1321
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:18,530
being good at something that like

1322
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:25,240
I was like surrounded by fighters and
guys who believed in me and like who cared

1323
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:30,920
and like wanted to see me get better and
tougher and I was getting my ass kicked

1324
01:18:30,921 --> 01:18:34,400
every day and that was something that
wasn't used to just being in that

1325
01:18:34,401 --> 01:18:37,880
environment I had at that time learning,
I had a very strong team.

1326
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:41,120
Like I started at Vandelay school
when he was still fighting.

1327
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:44,060
So a lot of the guys that
was like shoot the box style.

1328
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:46,460
It's like everyone's getting knocked out.

1329
01:18:46,461 --> 01:18:50,450
Every training somebody gets knocked
out really very hard and that was,

1330
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:54,470
that was new for me to get and things
like that and doing that in Vegas.

1331
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:57,860
Oh yeah man.
I remember helping him get ready for

1332
01:18:58,410 --> 01:18:59,370
the

1333
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:01,610
either it was like Brian Sander,

1334
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:06,350
Chris Leben and throwing full on
the elbows in the cage. No Pad.

1335
01:19:06,351 --> 01:19:07,340
Like we're going at it.

1336
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:10,760
I'm like my jaw was dislocated everything
but it was just like what we learned

1337
01:19:10,761 --> 01:19:15,260
was just always fight in
Brasilia they pull Hada everyday.

1338
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,810
Wow.
Everyday pull Honda

1339
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:21,890
little Ohad the think about that.
Um,

1340
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:26,500
it definitely made me tough
in the beginning. Now I,

1341
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:31,120
I realize that like I've only been doing
this a short time and I already feel

1342
01:19:31,121 --> 01:19:35,260
like aches and pains and stuff and I
don't want it to be like that when I'm

1343
01:19:35,261 --> 01:19:38,680
older. So I'm a lot more
smarter about my training.

1344
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:43,090
And uh, do you think it was a critical
aspect of your success though?

1345
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:46,900
I needed gone through the fire like that.
I needed that because different guys,

1346
01:19:46,901 --> 01:19:51,880
you know what I was made of being,
being a guy who's overweight, insecure,

1347
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:53,290
all these things,

1348
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:57,880
never going on hikes or my dad
passed away when I was younger,

1349
01:19:58,420 --> 01:19:59,290
like very young.

1350
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:03,220
And so I never had my dad to encourage
me to go throw a ball or anything,

1351
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:07,180
play sports or be a man, be
a boy, be at, you know, just,

1352
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,870
I was always like kind of sheltered by
my mom and she was more like protective,

1353
01:20:12,871 --> 01:20:13,890
like, ah, I don't go do that.

1354
01:20:13,891 --> 01:20:16,140
And then she finally learned
to just like set me free,

1355
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,930
but I needed to know what I was made of.
Man,

1356
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:21,540
I needed to know what I was made of in,

1357
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:28,170
in the realm of men
fighting, whatever. It took,

1358
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,530
blood tears, sweat had the
same thing. They say like,

1359
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:34,140
I didn't know what that was like.
I never got a taste of it.

1360
01:20:34,141 --> 01:20:35,960
And so going through it in a real way,

1361
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:41,040
like actually getting my ass beat and
having to find my way out of it and can't

1362
01:20:41,101 --> 01:20:45,090
run from it and still like it's people
that cared about me too. It was like,

1363
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:49,830
it was just a great thing to
have and it now I enjoy it.

1364
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:54,330
I enjoy really good, hard fight.
You know something about it. That's,

1365
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,320
well you're,
you,

1366
01:20:55,321 --> 01:20:59,370
you're enjoying your progress to your
change of who you are as a person.

1367
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,420
You're strengthening.

1368
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:05,930
How far into your training was where you
like 100% all in committed like that?

1369
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:09,903
Uh,

1370
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:15,120
I think it was after my loss to Tyson,
Pedro,

1371
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:18,380
which was my second fight in the UFC,
um,

1372
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:23,010
before everything was still kind of
very fun and games and I was like, oh,

1373
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:26,400
I get to travel,
go to Australia to fight in Australia.

1374
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:29,130
So it was a big shock to be in the UFC,

1375
01:21:29,131 --> 01:21:33,990
especially not even expecting to be
there and within just a few years. So,

1376
01:21:33,991 --> 01:21:34,824
uh,

1377
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:39,480
after losing that fight is when I met my
friend and at the time my strength and

1378
01:21:39,481 --> 01:21:42,930
conditioning coach Lorenzo
and he had been through um,

1379
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,330
like pair rescue school
and things like that.

1380
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:48,720
So he helped me to just
develop this mentality of like,

1381
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:53,550
how far for your mind take you,
how big is your will?

1382
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:59,240
And when training with him and doing
kind of like pararescue survival training

1383
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:04,560
for conditioning, that, that was a,

1384
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:08,370
that was a point where I started
to like say it like, okay,

1385
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:11,100
I'm going to take this full on.
I know I can fight hard,

1386
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:16,370
but now I know how far my will can
go in the face of the elements and

1387
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:21,270
everything. So like putting those
two together, going after it.

1388
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:25,300
And then the fight I took after
that was Daniel Jolly and then I,

1389
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:27,270
I ended that in the first
round with the knee.

1390
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,140
And then I fought Paul Craig in Scotland
and I had the same mentality. Like,

1391
01:22:31,141 --> 01:22:34,440
I'm going forward, I'm getting better,
I'm going to sh grow stronger, better,

1392
01:22:34,441 --> 01:22:38,970
harder, like everything. And uh, then the,

1393
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:43,950
the fight to the Polish guy, uh, Michael
Alexei junk. Have you seen him lately?

1394
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:45,540
He's been,
he's been a,

1395
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:50,310
he just beat like John Volante
and I forgot. Oh, that's right.

1396
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:53,820
Yeah. With a body shop. I
lost it. Or I lost to him,

1397
01:22:53,821 --> 01:22:57,600
but then it got turned
into a no contest. So, um,

1398
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:00,840
after that was the [inaudible] fight.
So it's been,

1399
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:04,770
I'd say maybe a team to know no contest.
He tests positive. Yeah. It tested.

1400
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:09,820
But he was also, um, uh, uh, last minute,

1401
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,840
uh, last minute fight.
I was fuck his name up.

1402
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:18,800
Michael l Alexi joke. Alexi. Chuck.
It's a rough one at the Williams.

1403
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:23,250
I was butcher it terrible. But
some of those fucking name.

1404
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:27,840
Ah, sage. Yeah.

1405
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:32,290
So like three or four years, man. And
how many fights you have professionally?

1406
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:35,260
Uh, Dang. What's my work?

1407
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:39,360
Eight three 83 and one
that's funny that you know,

1408
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:43,150
you don't really know your record. I, hmm.
I don't remember. Eight. Three in one.

1409
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:46,180
I think it's a three in one. Wow. Yeah.

1410
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:51,010
That's amazing that you've been fighting
for a relatively short period of time

1411
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:55,960
and have a, achieved some pretty
fucking spectacular results, man.

1412
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,180
Do you have anybody in your past that
was into martial arts? Do you, uh,

1413
01:24:00,230 --> 01:24:02,890
is it in the family?
My brothers,

1414
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,980
my brothers were both like just
athletes in school and they were like,

1415
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:10,930
they were always getting in fights
and stuff at school. Like I said,

1416
01:24:10,931 --> 01:24:12,430
I was nonconfrontational so that was like,

1417
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:14,150
they were the biggest
fighters to me growing up.

1418
01:24:14,151 --> 01:24:16,840
Were they stunned that you're
a fighter now? Now? Um,

1419
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:20,680
my other brother has actually a fighter
too. He fought for like the world series,

1420
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:24,910
a world series of fighting one 25
belt and Andy contender series,

1421
01:24:24,911 --> 01:24:29,650
things like that. He still fighting, still
training. And then my oldest brother, he,

1422
01:24:29,651 --> 01:24:33,460
uh, he doesn't fight. He used to play
like college football and stuff. But yeah,

1423
01:24:33,461 --> 01:24:35,800
so I got one brother.
And so it's in the family a little bit,

1424
01:24:35,801 --> 01:24:36,820
at least a little bit.

1425
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:40,030
What do you think about the world
series of finding that which became the

1426
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:44,980
professional fighting given away $1
million to everybody who wins whatever.

1427
01:24:44,981 --> 01:24:46,600
They're respected weight
classes, right? Yeah.

1428
01:24:46,601 --> 01:24:49,210
And then you fight two times
in one night. Yeah. Yeah.

1429
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:52,420
What do you think of the cool, but I
don't know. Two Times in one night.

1430
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:53,920
I don't want it two
times in one night sucks,

1431
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:56,710
but I don't know if they get
paid to show up and then,

1432
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:59,050
or it's like you just fight and
then hopefully you get that meal.

1433
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:04,110
I don't want to see a guy who goes
through a three round war fight.

1434
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:08,560
A guy who knocked out in 10 seconds. Yeah,
because that can happen. It does happen.

1435
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:11,330
It just seems, it seems
so unfair. Did you see a,

1436
01:25:11,331 --> 01:25:14,190
I thought Vinny Magalhaes was going
to take it. That last one too. He's,

1437
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:16,580
I remember seeing a lot.
He's really coming to his zone.

1438
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:20,890
His striking is caught up with a lot of
his grapple. Oh yeah. And he's fantastic.

1439
01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:24,850
This bass very dangerous. I've never
seen a guy that big, that flexible.

1440
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:27,160
He can do everything.
When it comes to Jujitsu,

1441
01:25:27,161 --> 01:25:31,060
do you ever see when the flying arm
barred paid upon? Oh, nope. It's crazy.

1442
01:25:31,061 --> 01:25:35,680
Like who the fuck does that? Nope. I was
at that match. The uh, the Metamorris,

1443
01:25:35,681 --> 01:25:39,590
I think it was a w w was it metamorris
when he, when he grappled with Keenan.

1444
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:45,010
Was that Metamorris if like a few years
back, maybe like four or five years. Yeah.

1445
01:25:45,190 --> 01:25:48,970
It could have been metamorris
Ebi, metamorris matchups.
He had some good ones,

1446
01:25:48,971 --> 01:25:53,170
but I forget all the matchups.
Yeah, those are good events,
huh? Yes. Yeah. More. Huh?

1447
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,060
I wish there was more
of those, man. I mean,

1448
01:25:55,090 --> 01:26:00,090
I'm happy Eddie Bravo's sort of taken
over that space with the Ebi and a combat.

1449
01:26:00,401 --> 01:26:02,310
You just who now have
you seen that lapse or

1450
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:09,320
great idea? Right. It's nice to great. I'd
sometimes, like you might be holding on,

1451
01:26:09,321 --> 01:26:12,560
but that slap and then that
might cause a guide to like, oh,

1452
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:15,500
something changes the game.
There's things aren't available anymore.

1453
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:18,830
You can't just allow yourself, it's
just too hard. You could somebody like

1454
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:24,710
somebody stopped somebody Wagner
roadshow stop. Somebody's got on top,

1455
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:27,620
mounted them and just blasted
them with pumps. Their head. Yeah.

1456
01:26:27,621 --> 01:26:30,440
It was pretty rough, man.
It's like, it's almost like

1457
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:36,560
you can do ground and pound and we
learned from boss Rutan way back in the

1458
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,420
Pancrase days. Do you
remember those days? Yeah.

1459
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:43,250
Bas Rutten figured out how to pull his
hand back way further than other people

1460
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:47,180
and Bas Rutten would smash
guys would palm strikes.

1461
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:51,780
He was throwing like uppercuts and hooks.
Like he wasn't just like slapping.

1462
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:57,510
Yeah. These are really high level
Jujitsu to with smacks. Look at home.

1463
01:26:57,590 --> 01:27:01,270
What? Yeah. Do you know that guy's
not used to getting slapped out?

1464
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:04,820
Not by a guy with a nasty
guard like Wagner roadshow. Ah,

1465
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:08,060
he wants to tap his nose fucked up.

1466
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:13,460
Can you tap from this lap? Yeah, you
can tab. Oh, he's getting beat up,

1467
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:17,270
Mike. Maybe I'll try and seed enough. See,

1468
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:21,120
once he starts dropping those
palms down, Boy Paul, Huh?

1469
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:26,690
Yeah, it's a forehead. It's
a reality check. You know,

1470
01:27:26,691 --> 01:27:29,300
it's a reality check about how
dangerous this position is.

1471
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:34,780
You can't really just sit and let a guy
mount you to do something desperate to

1472
01:27:35,331 --> 01:27:38,820
get out of that. But in Jujitsu,
if the guy's just mounting you,

1473
01:27:38,821 --> 01:27:42,830
you can kind of chill out figuring out
how to escape the leg or something like

1474
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,920
that. Shit, combat Jujitsu, you
got to get the fuck out of there.

1475
01:27:45,921 --> 01:27:49,990
That's a terrible place to be safe.
They were like Amy May right be mounted.

1476
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,230
So it's, especially when he tired. Well,

1477
01:27:52,231 --> 01:27:56,840
the difference between MMA grappling and
regular grappling to used to always be

1478
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:59,900
with the, one of the big ones, at
least I should say, was leg locks.

1479
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:03,050
They thought you really couldn't get
away with leg locks in as much in MMA

1480
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:05,660
because as you're going for the legs,
you have two arms committed to the leg.

1481
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:08,120
Someone's just going to punch you in the
face and you don't have defense for it.

1482
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:13,040
But now you're seeing when God's like in
minority burst on the scene and started

1483
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:15,740
ripping guys knees apart and you see
how effective that is. And then Paul,

1484
01:28:15,741 --> 01:28:20,690
Horace [inaudible] no, you
don't like, like less scared
of it. It's they're scary,

1485
01:28:20,691 --> 01:28:24,850
Huh? Yeah, I've ever so infatuated three
knee operations and to reconstruction,

1486
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:29,950
but are like, do you like to watch? Oh
yeah, yeah, like a drawn down to her dude.

1487
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:34,580
He's so interesting Brian,
and you know. Yeah. Yeah.

1488
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:37,820
I remember just like kind of looking
into a little Edie Cummings. Yeah.

1489
01:28:37,821 --> 01:28:39,680
Those guys are savages. Gary, Tony,

1490
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:42,980
fucking people's legs up and you know,

1491
01:28:42,981 --> 01:28:46,550
and then Craig Jones and all these other
guys that are coming from all over the

1492
01:28:46,551 --> 01:28:48,490
world that are leg lock,
special style,

1493
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:53,210
they all have these complex leg lock
systems now. It's a total thing holders.

1494
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:56,330
A shitty fuck up.
You go zig when he should have zagged.

1495
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:00,350
Like when Brian Hall fought
Bj Penn, right? And he caught
him in that. I was like,

1496
01:29:00,351 --> 01:29:04,600
no, no, no. Not that way.
Yeah, you're just trying to
get out. He tried to get out.

1497
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:09,110
Ryan Hall just locked it up.
I just imagined the field
right now. I always say,

1498
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:14,010
oh well it's once that stuff gets chewed
up inside there, that's the problem.

1499
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,750
I mean,
some people could just take it,

1500
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:19,770
but once you start ripping
meniscus apart and cartilage apart,

1501
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:20,940
once that stuff starts happening,

1502
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:24,680
ligaments starts getting stretched out
and rip a little bit 10 they're always

1503
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:28,890
going to be wiggly. I mean even Gordon
ride just ripped his fucking leg apart.

1504
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:31,890
Did he really? Yeah, he
just had surgery. Um,

1505
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:34,710
I think he did it in an actual
grappling match. So I think his foot,

1506
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:38,520
his leg moved weird and it just,
it popped his, his knee apart.

1507
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:40,830
But the guy had a hold on
it. I don't think so. No, no,

1508
01:29:40,831 --> 01:29:41,910
I think it was in a scramble.

1509
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:47,030
I think it came a in a scramble but
there's a lot of those leg lock experts

1510
01:29:47,491 --> 01:29:50,430
right now that scare the shit out
and everything came from dean lister,

1511
01:29:50,431 --> 01:29:53,580
which is crazy. Lister t on the story. No,

1512
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:56,320
John Danaher was talking
to Dean lister and uh,

1513
01:29:56,610 --> 01:30:00,780
Dean lister was talking about leg locks
and John Danaher said something inquired

1514
01:30:00,781 --> 01:30:04,560
about why you do leg locks. And he goes,
why would you ignore 50% of the body

1515
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:09,780
and John Don heartbeat and it fucking
crazy wizards. He is like, why would you,

1516
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:12,390
why would you it all these meetings?

1517
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:16,770
Here's a fucking hilarious meme of John
Donna her in bed next to a woman and it

1518
01:30:16,771 --> 01:30:17,250
says,

1519
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:22,250
why would you ignore 40% 50% of the
body of man and then other guys?

1520
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,100
Yeah. Well Don, hers,

1521
01:30:26,101 --> 01:30:31,101
a guy who understands things like he
sees them on a very complex level,

1522
01:30:32,821 --> 01:30:36,690
like he understands all the various
possible exchanges and what's the best way

1523
01:30:36,691 --> 01:30:40,740
to mitigate like stop the defense, push
the offense, control the situation.

1524
01:30:40,741 --> 01:30:43,520
What is, what is the ultimate control
position? I have to get to it.

1525
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:46,210
Do I have to get on the inside? Do
I grab it this way? I do. I grab it.

1526
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:47,063
And then they,

1527
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,830
once they started really experimenting
and putting it together and putting it

1528
01:30:49,831 --> 01:30:54,570
into a system and you see how these guys
who have only been doing Jujitsu for a

1529
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:56,460
few years like Nikki Ryan and Gordon,
right?

1530
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:59,790
They start tapping all these like
really legit guys. They're like,

1531
01:30:59,791 --> 01:31:01,700
what the fuck is happening?
Yeah. Those systems,

1532
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:04,970
it's got Kamora system that
blocks us from everything. Huh.

1533
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,100
I think that helps a lot.
It just when it comes to training,

1534
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:11,450
learning things in systems, you
know what I mean? I think 10 plant,

1535
01:31:11,451 --> 01:31:14,340
it has like their own system.
Right? For sure. And it helps.

1536
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:18,600
It helps to go to another state. Like
it's the same. Yeah, same system. Right.

1537
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:20,670
They'll all systems help. Yeah. You know,

1538
01:31:20,671 --> 01:31:24,620
I mean and then fighters devise their
own system really often, you know,

1539
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:27,420
have their own entries and their
own ways of defending things.

1540
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:32,130
But the leg lock games so unexpected
because I always thought they were a good

1541
01:31:32,131 --> 01:31:36,210
technique if you can get it,
but it's not that high percentage in MMA.

1542
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:40,480
That was Kinda how I felt. You didn't see
too many of them. I don't know why. Well,

1543
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:42,030
I think it was,
we didn't,

1544
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,950
we had a few guys that were really
good in the early days like, oh look,

1545
01:31:44,951 --> 01:31:48,720
tuck tar off and you know some other guys
who are really good but we didn't have

1546
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:53,670
the level that you have what like
a Paul Harris dive in on things,

1547
01:31:53,671 --> 01:31:56,430
transitioning from one thing to the next
and then locking you up in a position

1548
01:31:56,431 --> 01:31:58,800
where you had a tap quick. Cause if
you don't, you're gonna be screened.

1549
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,290
Do you think a lot of the times it is
those guys like the other guy's fault or

1550
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:06,580
does he really just hold too long?
He definitely holds too long. He has,

1551
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:09,910
there's one fight from Brazil where
it's crazy. He's just not letting go.

1552
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:12,730
He's just holding on to something,
I forget what it was,

1553
01:32:12,731 --> 01:32:15,220
but he was not letting go and they were
trying to separate it when he was still

1554
01:32:15,221 --> 01:32:18,520
hanging onto it.
I think he came from a really,

1555
01:32:18,521 --> 01:32:22,900
really bad childhood and he's talked
about it in depth about growing up on a

1556
01:32:22,901 --> 01:32:27,220
farm and being forced to eat pig slop
was pig slop when he was a little boy,

1557
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:31,720
that cut that he has on his chest, that
big scar. He had sealed that up with glue.

1558
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:36,640
Yeah. Like crazy shit
man. Yeah, he's actually,

1559
01:32:36,641 --> 01:32:40,720
I've met him before a few
times, like through a, yeah,

1560
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:44,290
there's some friends and he
seems like a cool guy. Yeah,
he does. You know, genuine.

1561
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:47,530
I just think when he was
killed in competition, man, he,

1562
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:52,300
he just doesn't want to let it go.
He wants and they make him let it go.

1563
01:32:52,301 --> 01:32:53,081
And He tried,

1564
01:32:53,081 --> 01:32:56,440
even though he knew that they were
gonna get mad at him if he didn't let go

1565
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,010
still in quite let go. Yeah. And they
were like, get the fuck Outta here.

1566
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,120
They kicked him out of the UFC,

1567
01:33:01,121 --> 01:33:04,780
the first guy ever to get kicked out of
the UFC for holding on submissions. Oh,

1568
01:33:04,781 --> 01:33:08,260
he got kicked out. Ah, okay. Do you
know who he, who he held it against?

1569
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:11,350
I don't know, but I'm pretty,
I don't want, I want to
make sure that that's true.

1570
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,910
I think it is that who some are.

1571
01:33:13,911 --> 01:33:17,080
Paul Harris was the first guy to ever
get kicked out of the UFC and I think the

1572
01:33:17,081 --> 01:33:20,530
last one that got kicked out for it was
like any normal person wouldn't even

1573
01:33:20,531 --> 01:33:22,720
gotten in trouble for that
one. Yeah. It was like normal.

1574
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:26,560
It was like maybe a little bit too long,
but it was on that borderline edge.

1575
01:33:26,561 --> 01:33:30,910
But because it was him,
people like enough, you know,

1576
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:34,480
he's it. Was that what it
was? It wasn't in the UFC,

1577
01:33:34,481 --> 01:33:37,360
but it was a controversial
submission victory ever.

1578
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:41,410
Jake shields at the world series
of fighting Jake Shields, I think.

1579
01:33:42,430 --> 01:33:47,260
Yeah, but I think he did that too. But
that was a Kimora. Yeah, that's right.

1580
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:50,770
But I think before that he
got kicked out of the UFC,

1581
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:56,560
released in 2013 Oh, Mike Pearce. Yes.

1582
01:33:57,430 --> 01:34:01,480
Referee interviewing. That's right.
Yup. So that's what it was. Yeah.

1583
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:03,940
Okay.
That's what it was.

1584
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:08,530
He was released after holding onto a
heel hook of Mike Pierce in 2013 yeah.

1585
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:10,870
But look man,
that guy was,

1586
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:16,180
was particularly scary when he fought
because he was so strong and his body was

1587
01:34:16,331 --> 01:34:18,820
so well designed for. He'll hook, right.

1588
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:23,080
He just could grab a hold of you and to
rip your shit apart. Man. Look at that.

1589
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:28,000
Oh my God. Look at this now
look what he does here. See,

1590
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:32,530
he grabs a little bit. My
peers, dawn is tapping, tapping.

1591
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:36,130
Tapping is still holding. Still holding
on. But that's all in slow motion.

1592
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:40,330
But it looked to me like he was still
ripping the Nia part even though he knew

1593
01:34:40,331 --> 01:34:43,240
that the guy tapped. Yeah,
he had it. He knew he had it.

1594
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:45,580
He's just punishing that guy.
You know?

1595
01:34:45,581 --> 01:34:49,000
He makes it scarier for other people
and he's probably used to doing it.

1596
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:53,260
You know, he had this psychological block.
They all say that. He's like a really,

1597
01:34:53,261 --> 01:34:56,930
really nice guy. Yeah. He just become
that guy that nobody wants to fight.

1598
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:00,530
You can't get a moment.
But I think in the Jake shields fight,

1599
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:02,960
there was other shit that was happening
too. I think there was high pokes.

1600
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:05,330
I'm pretty sure he said dirty fight.

1601
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:10,380
What are you here?
Yeah.

1602
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:13,183
What are we hearing?

1603
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:17,560
Something bleeding through into our
microphones. I've heard this before.

1604
01:35:17,561 --> 01:35:20,500
I've been trying to catch what it
was. Go Sprout. Know what it's from.

1605
01:35:20,650 --> 01:35:22,360
It's some interference.
I see.

1606
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:24,640
Okay.

1607
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:27,940
This is like, um, so I don't know if the
people can hear it. Can the people here,

1608
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:33,760
all right. It was not as this, what is,
what is it? The file? Pull up the fight.

1609
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:37,450
That's how you left.
[inaudible] it's very low.

1610
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:40,270
It's me just debunk ghost bro.

1611
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:46,220
Which fight was it that you pulled up? Uh,
that, that fight that took, you know, oh,

1612
01:35:46,230 --> 01:35:48,520
what do you guys near Park? Yeah. Yeah.

1613
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:53,500
He was the first guy to be like super
scary and a elite modern level with heel

1614
01:35:53,501 --> 01:35:56,230
hooks. Where did he start off?
Do you know what promotion? Well,

1615
01:35:56,231 --> 01:36:00,130
he's a [inaudible] guy. Okay,
so he came out of Brazil.

1616
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,620
Probably cage warriors. I don't know man.
I don't know where, where are we? What?

1617
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:08,260
He was fighting and in Brazil, I don't
remember seeing cage worries is the UK,

1618
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:11,830
is it? Yeah. That's where
Anderson came from. Well Anderson,

1619
01:36:11,831 --> 01:36:13,210
when he made the jump from pride,

1620
01:36:13,211 --> 01:36:16,990
he did cage warriors for a while and
then came over to the UFC and I think

1621
01:36:16,991 --> 01:36:19,010
that's when he started working with uh,

1622
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:22,170
the new guerrez when he started
fighting in a cage fighters. Oh.

1623
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:25,780
So he fought in a bunch of fewer
EFCs fought a bunch of stuff.

1624
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:29,570
Storm Samurai 12 Tom, Tom, ouch.

1625
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:33,670
Storm Samurai 12.
I want a t shirt for Storm Samurai 12

1626
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:39,100
throwback. Yeah. Real throw back. Yeah,

1627
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,150
he had a great um,

1628
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:45,180
it goes to show you how good Gary
tone is as a submission grapple too.

1629
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:47,620
Cause they had a great submission,
grappling match put, keep,

1630
01:36:47,621 --> 01:36:50,170
go back to his record there because
I think that was listed there.

1631
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:55,120
I think it turned out in a draw and Gary
[inaudible] is so much smaller than him.

1632
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:00,710
Draw. Yeah. Gary Tone. Oh
yeah, that would reset. Yeah.

1633
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:05,750
But is that really 2016 I think it was
because I remember now that was Craig

1634
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:09,550
Jones. Okay. 2018 was Craig Jones. Yeah.

1635
01:37:09,551 --> 01:37:13,330
Cause [inaudible] was posting
pictures about like how he looks now.

1636
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:14,860
Keep me know he's got like,

1637
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:18,370
he's got a high fade and like this big
mustache banalities all it looks like

1638
01:37:18,371 --> 01:37:22,210
jacked up a thousand pounds. Yeah, for
sure. So he's running through walls. Yeah.

1639
01:37:22,990 --> 01:37:25,750
Is He fighting MMA anymore? Is,
are you just doing grappling?

1640
01:37:25,751 --> 01:37:28,900
I think he might just be doing grappling.
I haven't heard of d. If it made news,

1641
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:32,440
that's something extra scary about
a guy. I'll fuck your knee up. Yeah.

1642
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:35,050
You know what's up?
Look at the size of him now.

1643
01:37:36,370 --> 01:37:40,900
He's with hic Hickey Monster.
Whole farm

1644
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:47,020
you side and not want to get my,
my heel caught in that armpit.

1645
01:37:47,050 --> 01:37:51,670
Yeah. Look at those, that
picture above where he's
screaming. Look at that picture.

1646
01:37:51,671 --> 01:37:56,170
Like what in the fuck man.
Oh look at Craig Jones

1647
01:37:56,510 --> 01:38:00,180
show that is a body designed
to rip your legs apart.

1648
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:06,270
Do you know the hill hook came,
uh, not enough to really play it,

1649
01:38:06,271 --> 01:38:09,920
but um,
spent a little bit of time picking,

1650
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:14,040
picking the brains of people who are
getting them. Yeah, I like it. I enjoy it.

1651
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:17,400
Yeah. I think I could, I think I
could actually get pretty good at it.

1652
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,700
It's like the basics of
it seems pretty simple.

1653
01:38:20,701 --> 01:38:24,000
It's just a matter of like getting
comfortable there because I feel like my

1654
01:38:24,001 --> 01:38:27,930
knees are just, I don't want to risk it,
you know what I mean? All I can do, oh,

1655
01:38:27,931 --> 01:38:30,140
let's play this game a little bit.
Yeah.

1656
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:35,930
But if I find a partner that's not an
asshole and just like really wants to like

1657
01:38:36,270 --> 01:38:39,870
learn together or whatever, then
I'll, I'll do it. I'll go after it.

1658
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:42,930
Do you ever see yourself doing Jujitsu
matches or anything like that? Yeah,

1659
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:46,980
I've only done maybe three of
my life. Yeah. Yeah, I did one,

1660
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:52,110
my last Jujitsu competition
was probably two years ago,

1661
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:56,250
two and a half years ago.
Naga, just like, it was random,

1662
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,500
just like a random like, oh,
okay, I'll do Naga today.

1663
01:38:58,830 --> 01:39:03,710
Well there are some MMA fighters that
are at a high enough level of grappling

1664
01:39:03,711 --> 01:39:08,500
and they can compete against really
elite grapplers and Jiu Jitsu matches,

1665
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:12,660
you know, like, um, Chad
Mendez member, he had that, um,

1666
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:17,430
that match with, um, Jeff. Fuck,

1667
01:39:17,431 --> 01:39:21,480
why am I blanking on his name now?
Jeff Glover. Jeff Glover. Really? Yeah.

1668
01:39:21,481 --> 01:39:23,640
I didn't know that. Yeah.
I think he choked him out.

1669
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:26,430
And thank you Chad Mendez choke out.
Jeff Glover.

1670
01:39:26,431 --> 01:39:31,380
I think he took his back and
tapped him. Yeah. Oh, ah.

1671
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:36,770
I think they were using
the Eddie Bravo uh,

1672
01:39:37,230 --> 01:39:40,770
invitational rules make,
make sure that's true. Ah,

1673
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,140
which you start on someone's
back. Yeah. You know,

1674
01:39:43,141 --> 01:39:45,270
in over time you go to a certain distance.

1675
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,350
Is that chail son in Schmidt is
it's chill Sonnen's organization.

1676
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:53,400
And in which case, I'm pretty
sure they use a, the Ebi rules.

1677
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:59,510
So he got his back through sort of
an one of those over time positions,

1678
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:03,060
but he's still tapped him.
And the other one is Uriah faber.

1679
01:40:03,061 --> 01:40:06,570
Uriah Faber is pretty fucking elite.
Pretty fucking elite.

1680
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:11,700
Like Jen Glover's animal. Oh my God, I
love that guy. Super, super technical,

1681
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:16,260
you know, and very dangerous
and relaxed. Right.

1682
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:20,390
Big Time stoner. Yeah. So he,

1683
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:24,300
they must've set him up on his back.
This doesn't show it.

1684
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,010
It just shows him have the back man.

1685
01:40:26,011 --> 01:40:29,190
That's a hell of a fucking ruined
and right there that works all day on

1686
01:40:29,191 --> 01:40:33,870
everybody. Even a Jeff Glover. Wow. That's
why Jiu Jitsu works, you know it will,

1687
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:37,610
if you're a lead, it'll
work. Save your ass. Yeah.

1688
01:40:37,650 --> 01:40:41,250
Three by overtime submission.
So we were correct. Yeah.

1689
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:44,520
Yeah. There's, so there's a few guys,

1690
01:40:44,521 --> 01:40:48,420
but it's really hard to be the master
of everything. Right? Yeah, for sure.

1691
01:40:48,421 --> 01:40:50,280
So for you,
is there a balance where you're like,

1692
01:40:50,281 --> 01:40:53,950
am I spending enough time grappling? Am
I spending enough time striking? Do you,

1693
01:40:53,951 --> 01:40:58,840
do you ever like wonder what the correct
formula is or do you tinker with it at

1694
01:40:58,841 --> 01:40:59,674
all?

1695
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:03,053
Okay.

1696
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:05,870
I have wondered and I always wonder,
but

1697
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:12,540
I can't like so a long time ago,

1698
01:41:12,541 --> 01:41:15,750
maybe like a few years ago,
Anderson told me like, listen,

1699
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:21,180
just you need Jujitsu. Like you need
it. And he's like, it saved my life.

1700
01:41:21,210 --> 01:41:24,960
I love to strike too. But when I
learned Jujitsu, it changed my life.

1701
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,300
So you need to learn it.
Put on a g,

1702
01:41:27,510 --> 01:41:30,690
let's roll like it right
there in the living room, you
know? And I was just like,

1703
01:41:30,691 --> 01:41:34,950
okay. So one of the things that
I learned from him is just,

1704
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:39,090
he's like,
learn the basic stuff,

1705
01:41:39,450 --> 01:41:43,080
like learn the basic stuff. Get
really good at it. And then,

1706
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:49,360
and then like use it to save yourself
and you'll, you'll end up growing.

1707
01:41:49,361 --> 01:41:51,040
He's like,
just keep training Jujitsu.

1708
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:55,690
You don't need this whole crazy
secret system at the moment.

1709
01:41:55,691 --> 01:41:59,770
Just make sure that you're training
Jujitsu and continue to learn Jujitsu.

1710
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:04,660
You know, like, so that's kind of
my takeaway from the conversation.

1711
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:09,190
So I just make sure that when I'm
training, at least I'm doing Jujitsu,

1712
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:10,503
you know,
like,

1713
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:11,390
okay,

1714
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:13,520
I focus on it,
make sure that I'm getting better,

1715
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:16,640
make sure that I'm going with
guys that are way better than me.

1716
01:42:16,670 --> 01:42:18,020
So I'm always getting my ass kicked by.

1717
01:42:18,021 --> 01:42:22,310
At least I'm always going with guys that
are better than me all the time. Um,

1718
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:28,720
and like I enjoy it, but I'm a
striker. That's it. Like, I enjoy it.

1719
01:42:28,721 --> 01:42:30,100
I know that I need it.
It's my job.

1720
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:33,220
I know that it can get dangerous
if I go against, you know,

1721
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:35,740
if I go against the guy who was a
high level Jujitsu, I know that,

1722
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:41,400
I understand that and I'm very aware
of it every time that I trained and I,

1723
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:46,750
so I make sure that I do my
job and I go to Jujitsu class,

1724
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:49,510
but I'm a striker and I'm
always going to be focused on,

1725
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:54,120
that's always going to be what like my
Goto, anybody, whether it's a striker,

1726
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:56,620
a grappler,
I don't care.

1727
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:59,080
I'm going to train striking and
I'm going to train Jujitsu too,

1728
01:42:59,081 --> 01:43:00,910
but I'm going to my striking always.

1729
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:04,120
Do you think that that is like
you letting everybody know,

1730
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:06,340
are you trying to trick
people and then next,

1731
01:43:06,490 --> 01:43:10,120
next fight you're going to shoot on folks,
I don't need to shoot.

1732
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:11,470
I'll shoot if I need to.

1733
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:15,640
Like if I'm getting my ass kicked
and I needed take a desperation shot.

1734
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:19,960
But you would rather just let them know
that you're coming out striking because

1735
01:43:20,090 --> 01:43:23,470
one of the things that I believe
you do and you're very good at it,

1736
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:27,460
but one of the things that's
interesting about real high level MMA,

1737
01:43:27,461 --> 01:43:28,420
when you look at the guys who were,

1738
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:31,870
who had been like legendarily successful
like George Saint Pierre or mighty

1739
01:43:31,871 --> 01:43:33,550
mouse,
two great examples.

1740
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,890
One of the things that you never knew
what the fuck they're going to do to you

1741
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:40,300
and that overloading the mine with
possibilities is a part of their success.

1742
01:43:40,301 --> 01:43:42,670
It's like how much of a part,
it's a good question.

1743
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:47,650
Do you think that there's an argument
for using the skills that you have which

1744
01:43:47,651 --> 01:43:52,651
are quite spectacular with that sort of
style sort of style that incorporates

1745
01:43:53,151 --> 01:43:56,870
way more take downs, way more take
down attempts, way more faints.

1746
01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:59,120
Just just different
combinations of things.

1747
01:43:59,121 --> 01:44:02,090
So you never know what the
fuck is happening at any
given time or do you think

1748
01:44:02,091 --> 01:44:06,080
that it's better to just be the best
striker you can and that'll be enough?

1749
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:10,040
You stop those takedowns
that'll be enough for me.

1750
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,420
For you or just in
general? For you, for you?

1751
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:18,320
I think for me it would
be the best to just

1752
01:44:20,410 --> 01:44:25,300
be the best striker. Did you enjoy it
that much more? I enjoy that much more.

1753
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:30,540
Um, you know, I think yeah,

1754
01:44:30,570 --> 01:44:32,610
I enjoy that much more.
I still have a lot to learn,

1755
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:36,240
a lot to grow so that it's always going
to get better. I don't think that it's,

1756
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:39,470
I don't think that's going to get bad.
I'm still learning a lot,

1757
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:42,390
especially with what you guys got
to see like a few weeks ago and it,

1758
01:44:42,410 --> 01:44:46,400
that's the only at the beginning, like
everything, even before that was like

1759
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:51,200
nonexistent compared to like the type
of training that I've been doing.

1760
01:44:51,201 --> 01:44:55,060
So I'm like, I'm really
excited. So I'm like, ah boy.

1761
01:44:55,210 --> 01:44:59,510
He ties a lot more than just punch
kicks and elbows, you know? And that's,

1762
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:04,310
that's all the striking game. It's
infatuated by it right now. Yeah.

1763
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:08,180
Just want to focus on 100%.
Yeah. Like there's guys like,

1764
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:13,640
uh, think about like
Michael Van and page, right?

1765
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,620
Like before he fought like Paul Daley,

1766
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:18,800
I'm sure that guy trains a
lot of grappling as well.

1767
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:22,850
And it shows like if he gets in positions,
like he's knocked out guys from weird,

1768
01:45:22,910 --> 01:45:25,580
you know, we're positions, but
when people watch him fight,

1769
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:29,180
they want to see like they trust
in his stand up. They're like, oh,

1770
01:45:29,181 --> 01:45:30,890
this guy's going to do some crazy stuff.
Yeah.

1771
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:33,770
And I kind of want to be
able to do the same thing.

1772
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:37,730
Not Crazy like you know,
worldly stuff,

1773
01:45:37,731 --> 01:45:40,070
but when people watch me fight,

1774
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:43,670
they know what to expect and that's
just like bulletproof striking.

1775
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:45,313
No.

1776
01:45:46,270 --> 01:45:49,930
Yeah.
That fight was a very unexpected,

1777
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:53,860
the way Paul dealer decide to take him
down. I was like, I was pretty stunned.

1778
01:45:54,030 --> 01:45:56,470
Yeah. I didn't think we're going
to see that. Let me, Paul Daley.

1779
01:45:56,471 --> 01:45:58,060
So dangerous is fucking left.

1780
01:45:58,061 --> 01:46:02,440
Hook is one of the best in all of the
business is lefthand period. Anyway,

1781
01:46:02,441 --> 01:46:05,820
throws it. Both of them knew what they
were going up against. So like Yup.

1782
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:10,030
Even behind the shit talk they knew like
it was a tough fight for both of them.

1783
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:10,751
It was.

1784
01:46:10,751 --> 01:46:15,751
But it was interesting to me watching
page use his distance and that crazy

1785
01:46:16,030 --> 01:46:18,970
karate point style and that,
you know,

1786
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:23,680
we had to hit a really
look out for that stuff.

1787
01:46:23,740 --> 01:46:26,860
I mean he had a head of make sure that
he wasn't getting dinged by that stuff.

1788
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:28,650
Yeah,
well he's coming in with a high cause.

1789
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:31,690
Venom throws all this wild stuff like a,

1790
01:46:31,691 --> 01:46:36,691
almost like a fencer like dives in on
you and pops you and you could tell Paul

1791
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:41,830
Daley was like really having a hard time,
like finding that range. Yeah. It's,

1792
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:43,870
it's hard to,
to,

1793
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:48,190
to fight against guys that are long
and know how to use their body like

1794
01:46:48,191 --> 01:46:50,130
athletically.
Is He fighting

1795
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:53,070
Douglas Lema? Next is, that's
what's happening over in Beltour.

1796
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:55,230
I remember seeing that
Douglas Lema had a fight,

1797
01:46:55,231 --> 01:46:58,650
but I don't remember who the opponent was.
Who's Michael Venom page fighting.

1798
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,860
Find out that he's a spectacular
though, man. Right. You need that.

1799
01:47:01,861 --> 01:47:05,880
He landed on Cyborg was holy shit.
He caved the man's head and skull.

1800
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:09,300
He's never seen that. I've never
seen the razor. Just insane.

1801
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,490
Like you got hit with a media.
Imagine the pain.

1802
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:15,840
Imagine Matt and he was hanging out with
a headache, the bed like four months.

1803
01:47:15,841 --> 01:47:19,700
He's like, I'll be fighting to get in four
months. And they were like, Bro. Yeah,

1804
01:47:19,930 --> 01:47:23,910
I met that guy in Brazil. It's tough, man.
Yeah, he's tough. He's been around it.

1805
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:27,150
That's why when you see a guy like that
cover his face and then fall down like

1806
01:47:27,151 --> 01:47:30,750
that. Oh, it is Chandler
versus pit bull. Uh,

1807
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:34,440
Lima versus MVP. That's
it. Tagless Lima's no,

1808
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:39,480
11 he's no joke. That's a dangerous
man. Lima, the opportunity to head.

1809
01:47:39,810 --> 01:47:43,710
He's a fucking enormous
welterweight to Lima is easy.

1810
01:47:43,711 --> 01:47:47,170
I've never seen him in person is
a big frame for, for one seven.

1811
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:51,180
Woo cuts a lot of weight. But he's
so powerful when he gets in there.

1812
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:54,900
Dangerous fucking striker.
Lima's he's for real.

1813
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:58,290
That to me is as interesting, if not
more interesting. The Paul daily fight.

1814
01:47:58,291 --> 01:48:02,560
I want to see what happens. Yeah. Lima is
a little different than like, he's not,

1815
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:06,630
he's not gonna trash talk a lot. Like he
knows he's dangerous guide. So there's,

1816
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:09,390
Michael is going to be a good one.
That's a real good one for sure. Yeah.

1817
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:13,170
Well fights like that really legitimize
Beltour because these are fights that

1818
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:17,580
they can be easily be a main event
in the UFC. Talent wise. You know,

1819
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:22,110
unquestionably that
fight oof venom page is,

1820
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:26,520
he's a real fucking hard pill to
swallow, man. Figure that guy out.

1821
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:29,490
Who the fuck can you bring in
a train that can move like him?

1822
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:34,200
No one you can try but you're not, he
doesn't even know how he's going to move.

1823
01:48:34,201 --> 01:48:38,940
You know? I think that guy just puts out
music and just whatever happens happens.

1824
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:42,930
Yeah. That's why this fight
is so interesting because
Lima is like way more like,

1825
01:48:42,931 --> 01:48:47,250
uh, has, uh, just a rock solid
traditional stance. You know,

1826
01:48:47,251 --> 01:48:48,780
he moves real well.

1827
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,950
Devastating power that's going
to be a really good fight.

1828
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:56,460
Where does it leave a train? Do
you know? It's a good question.

1829
01:48:56,850 --> 01:49:01,810
Where's the Douglas Lema
train? Um, Jamie's going to
find that out for us. Yeah.

1830
01:49:01,970 --> 01:49:04,740
Yeah. I'm very happy that there's
a bunch of good organizations like,

1831
01:49:04,770 --> 01:49:09,080
like one and you know, like the
Pfl now and Bella Tor. It's,

1832
01:49:09,081 --> 01:49:12,510
it's great that 5% of
options. Super good. Yeah, it

1833
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:18,120
a lot of times too. Like I like
to just watch whatever's going on.

1834
01:49:18,121 --> 01:49:20,970
You never know who you're going
to come across. Where is that?

1835
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:26,370
Where's that American top team?
Similar is it to this terrifying

1836
01:49:28,380 --> 01:49:29,880
nasty combinations,
man.

1837
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:34,470
He's got ruthless leg kicks to man att.
Where?

1838
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:38,820
Which one? There's a bunch of
those. Right? On top teams.

1839
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:44,460
You might be att Florida. I Dunno it
was he, it didn't look like the Florida,

1840
01:49:44,461 --> 01:49:48,190
but att,
how many ATPs are there?

1841
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:49,633
I have no idea.

1842
01:49:49,850 --> 01:49:54,850
Is there a bunch I should know that
I think of a training two or three.

1843
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:59,140
Who? Cat Fight Club? I guess Thailand.
Oh really? In this article right here.

1844
01:49:59,141 --> 01:50:02,510
That just came out, uh,
yesterday. Okay. Fight Club.

1845
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:05,290
Maybe saw your fight and it's like,
fuck it.

1846
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:10,680
I'm going to Thailand to
bringing everybody. Everybody
come Joe when you come in?

1847
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,060
Huh?
Wow.

1848
01:50:14,450 --> 01:50:19,120
Since he's been a lot of places
recently for this fight. Honestly,

1849
01:50:19,121 --> 01:50:20,530
nowadays my life was a camp.

1850
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:23,710
Lima stated it's been like six or seven
months and I haven't stopped trying to

1851
01:50:23,711 --> 01:50:27,250
improve. For me, this is a
lifestyle. Yeah. It's, um,

1852
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:28,990
the only thing that really bothers me,

1853
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:33,610
the only thing that bothers me is that
it's difficult to get a champion to fight

1854
01:50:33,611 --> 01:50:34,444
a champion,

1855
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:38,680
like a champion from the UFC to find the
champion from one or to fight a chance

1856
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:42,490
up with that. Yeah. I think that would
be good for everybody. That'd be so sick.

1857
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:45,670
Yeah, it'd be good for, we should find
out who the fuck who's running shit.

1858
01:50:45,730 --> 01:50:48,970
Exactly. Yeah. Make that happen. Or how,

1859
01:50:48,971 --> 01:50:53,971
also how UFC fighters can do
like Muy Thai fights on the side.

1860
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:56,380
Sure.
I would love that.

1861
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:59,020
That'd be hard for them to do though
because you'd have to justify it.

1862
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:03,250
Like what if they got hurt and they
couldn't fight in a car and then the UFC

1863
01:51:03,251 --> 01:51:06,360
like loses an asset. You know, they
would think of it in terms of like a,

1864
01:51:06,361 --> 01:51:08,980
a possible main event like player.

1865
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:12,850
Like if there's a guy who's a top
of the food chain dude, and he says,

1866
01:51:12,851 --> 01:51:15,670
I want to say one more tie
fight and the terraces, MCL,

1867
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:18,960
and then six months later it's still not
ready to fight, but they should do it.

1868
01:51:18,961 --> 01:51:23,290
Like, if you're not, like, if
you're the top 15, you can't do it.

1869
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:29,350
Yeah. That's not a bad idea. If you're
not even ranked, go ahead. Go crazy. Yeah.

1870
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:31,870
One more time. Going to be a while
before they'll let you do what?

1871
01:51:31,871 --> 01:51:34,360
Jujitsu tournament though,
right? Jujitsu's fine. Yeah.

1872
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:37,090
Did you just fucking
dangerous too. Yeah. Yeah.

1873
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:41,980
You can go against a guy like Paul
hour is. Yeah. Um, yeah. You be cool,

1874
01:51:41,981 --> 01:51:46,810
man. Shop father. The other Cyborg Brazil,

1875
01:51:47,030 --> 01:51:50,770
uh, Ricardo brew. Oh,
that guy. Yeah. He's,

1876
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,420
he was one of my Jujitsu traders at
the Angeles. Yeah. He's a beast. Yeah.

1877
01:51:55,730 --> 01:51:59,680
Was a big man. Yeah. And the
shock basically kept him away.

1878
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:03,100
Just pushed him away from him. Yeah. Yeah.

1879
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:05,710
He didn't want to get his legs ripped
apart. I think I remember that.

1880
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:07,960
That might've been the time where
shop was over at Black House.

1881
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:10,770
I think he was gonna he was
gonna go do that. Well, his,

1882
01:52:10,780 --> 01:52:11,890
his point of view was like,
look,

1883
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:15,070
I have to fight because I'm not going
to get my leg torn apart. Take me down.

1884
01:52:15,071 --> 01:52:17,600
Do something. You're not even
doing anything. It's not worth it.

1885
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:21,780
Then later he did sit in his guard,
but he couldn't do anything to them.

1886
01:52:21,781 --> 01:52:25,740
It's mostly defensive. He basically shut
his, his Jujitsu down though. I mean that,

1887
01:52:25,770 --> 01:52:29,050
that he really did do that. If you
really stop and think about it, I mean,

1888
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:31,450
Cyborg wanted to do something
and we stalled them out.

1889
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:36,720
It's not a fun thing to watch and
it's not good if you're a cyborg.

1890
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:41,800
Yeah, but if a guy could stall
you out, like that's a weird,

1891
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:45,830
in a grappling situation, that's a weird
situation. Someone just defenses you.

1892
01:52:45,831 --> 01:52:48,800
It just pushes you out. Never attacks.
Just keeps pushing you off. Yeah.

1893
01:52:48,801 --> 01:52:51,920
What do you do? What do
you do? Yeah, I mean,

1894
01:52:51,921 --> 01:52:56,570
and how much of your Jujitsu is based
on someone that's willing to engage?

1895
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:03,260
That's a problem with, you said big
problem. When guys go to the ground,

1896
01:53:03,530 --> 01:53:07,670
oftentimes you'll see them almost
not even securing a position.

1897
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:11,000
Just sit thinking this
position will maintain this
way because it isn't training

1898
01:53:11,001 --> 01:53:14,180
all the time because guys are just lying
on top of you and your and your guard

1899
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:17,330
instead of just jumping out of
your guard going need a belly.

1900
01:53:17,331 --> 01:53:18,930
And smashing you in the face.
Exactly.

1901
01:53:18,931 --> 01:53:21,500
You think you can catch a little break
because you do all the time and training.

1902
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:24,770
You really see that with Jujitsu
players sometimes, you know,

1903
01:53:24,771 --> 01:53:26,840
they forget they have to hold on.

1904
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:31,760
Like especially guys who used to train
with the g and then in an MMA fight and

1905
01:53:31,761 --> 01:53:34,640
the guys on top of them and they think
they're trying to set up an arm bar or

1906
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:37,850
something like that and that people are
just like, nope, I'm just to chill it.

1907
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:43,190
You'll get out of the spot. Decent
Trainingi yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1908
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:47,900
Where do you tread John? Jock. I'll,
last time I did it was two weeks ago,

1909
01:53:47,901 --> 01:53:52,760
three weeks ago. It might've even been
more me and a Russell Peters. Okay.

1910
01:53:52,761 --> 01:53:56,450
You've done it a couple of times. He did
it in Malibu too. He's a good dude, man.

1911
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:59,590
John John Machado is awesome. Yeah,
I heard good things about him. He's,

1912
01:53:59,610 --> 01:54:04,100
he's awesome. Couldn't be a nicer person
and uh, just really, really tactical,

1913
01:54:04,101 --> 01:54:07,310
really good at breaking things down.
Really good at explaining things.

1914
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:10,460
The big gym, it's a good
size. You know, he's,

1915
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:14,350
he'll get like 60 people there and a
noon class sometimes. So it gets packed.

1916
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:18,560
Yeah. Yeah. Is it the heart of the
city or what? And I was in Tarzana. Oh,

1917
01:54:18,561 --> 01:54:21,800
it turns out that, yeah, there's a bunch
of Machado. Jim's still though I think,

1918
01:54:21,801 --> 01:54:24,140
I think they have one in Redondo.
Hey, it's me and Russell.

1919
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:30,920
Um, but uh, he's just got,

1920
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:36,140
there's just perfect basics.
Perfect event.

1921
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:39,170
I mean, everything he does, he's
always in the perfect position.

1922
01:54:39,171 --> 01:54:42,410
His defense is always PR.
Like when you wrote with a
guy like that, it's like, wow,

1923
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:43,880
there's so many levels to this thing.

1924
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:47,270
Like it just lets you know what
this is just level after level.

1925
01:54:47,271 --> 01:54:50,690
He's never in danger, ever.
Never. He's always laughing. Oh,

1926
01:54:50,691 --> 01:54:54,960
Joe Hogan and Joe Joe Hogan and
you're trying to get them out.

1927
01:54:56,150 --> 01:55:01,140
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. He talked to
that guy. Yeah, sure. Hassan. Yeah.

1928
01:55:01,210 --> 01:55:05,780
It's pretty cool. Hilarious man. That
character is one of the most weird,

1929
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:07,250
obscure,
like,

1930
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:11,360
think about it that it's a character
that he developed that's a fake Brazilian

1931
01:55:11,361 --> 01:55:13,070
multiple time world champion.

1932
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:18,300
But the dude who plays it is like he's
legit. He's a guy [inaudible] he's,

1933
01:55:18,301 --> 01:55:20,690
he's one of Eddie's black belts.
I think he got his back,

1934
01:55:20,691 --> 01:55:24,620
but I'm pretty sure he did. He's a
really good grappler, man. Really? Yeah,

1935
01:55:24,621 --> 01:55:29,190
but he pretends to be this guy.
[inaudible] yeah, I remember. I,

1936
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:32,560
I met him one time at Ebi needed. He
wouldn't come out of character. Yeah.

1937
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:35,720
That was fucking give me a hard
time about James Brown or something.

1938
01:55:35,721 --> 01:55:37,670
I think I forgot it was. Oh, we,

1939
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:42,630
but he's my friend. I've been friends
with him for a long time. He's a great,

1940
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:45,980
great in real life. That's not,
that's character. It's just,

1941
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:47,820
it's see so committed to this character.

1942
01:55:47,970 --> 01:55:50,250
He's been doing this character
for like 10 fucking years, man.

1943
01:55:50,251 --> 01:55:53,190
Does he do it just like in
public? Oh, fuck around with you.

1944
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:56,070
He'll bust out the character.
He's always on.

1945
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:59,250
It's gotta be fun though if
you've got to have the character.

1946
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:00,870
Some people got really mad at him though.

1947
01:56:00,871 --> 01:56:05,160
Like Nate Diaz got legitimately mad at
him. Was that at the, at the booth? Yes.

1948
01:56:05,350 --> 01:56:08,220
The OTM booth. Yeah. Something like
that. Yeah. Something happened.

1949
01:56:08,221 --> 01:56:12,210
I saw the video they got into, Nate was
like, get the fuck Outta here, bitch.

1950
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:15,300
And he was like, ah, Hey,
I'm just fucking around.

1951
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:20,040
This is what in the hell Bro.
Is that as IGA right there.

1952
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:24,210
You got to have to turn away because
of the girls, but not necessarily,

1953
01:56:24,211 --> 01:56:28,710
but he does have a couple, got a lot of
marks on his character, so he's hilarious.

1954
01:56:28,711 --> 01:56:32,060
Character hates child support
and is always attracted to buts.

1955
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:36,330
It's Alice have porch.
I mean it's a crazy character man.

1956
01:56:36,331 --> 01:56:38,670
It seems like something that someone
would have on a television show or

1957
01:56:38,671 --> 01:56:43,510
something, you know? It's ours.
It's only for like only MMA.

1958
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:47,880
People in Jujitsu. People know about
it. Exactly. Oh, what does it get it?

1959
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:50,760
You go try to hit the streets with that
Joe. They'd be like, what do you say it?

1960
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:51,810
I'm almost positive.

1961
01:56:51,811 --> 01:56:54,540
He's a black belt and the bees
are very legit martial artists.

1962
01:56:54,541 --> 01:56:58,820
That's pretty cool. His Dad was a karate
instructor too. He's a bad motherfucker.

1963
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:02,700
Zoom real martial artist. It's funny.
The character is just so funny. Yeah.

1964
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:07,140
I got to meet him. We could arrange
that. That's true. Cool. Shit.

1965
01:57:07,290 --> 01:57:11,700
So what is next for you after this
past fight? Um, what they do they do,

1966
01:57:11,701 --> 01:57:15,810
they give you some time to recover
and then hit you with some options.

1967
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:18,210
Does your management contact the UFC?
How does it work?

1968
01:57:18,430 --> 01:57:19,840
Uh,
yeah,

1969
01:57:19,841 --> 01:57:23,470
it could be management contacting them
or just UFC reaching out just to see when

1970
01:57:23,471 --> 01:57:26,360
I'll be ready. Um, but since the fight,

1971
01:57:26,380 --> 01:57:28,930
like I just took a little bit
of time off to see the family.

1972
01:57:28,931 --> 01:57:30,190
It's been a while since I've seen them.

1973
01:57:30,490 --> 01:57:32,860
Did they ever offer you
like a short notice fight?

1974
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:36,230
Uh,
I've gotten offered a short notice.

1975
01:57:36,231 --> 01:57:38,810
Five before I got offered that I'll,
I'll,

1976
01:57:38,930 --> 01:57:42,470
my a long time ago I got
offered that Gustafson fight.

1977
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:46,580
It was like a long shot. Didn't think
I was gonna get it, but I was down.

1978
01:57:46,581 --> 01:57:50,360
I was like, yeah, I'll take it. And
it was like, I think 10 days notice,

1979
01:57:50,690 --> 01:57:55,370
seven days notice that the at the, the
one in La. Um, but it didn't happen.

1980
01:57:55,550 --> 01:58:00,550
And then I offered to be the replacement
for the fight and Sao Paulo that Eric

1981
01:58:01,590 --> 01:58:04,670
Anders stepped in for.
But against Tiago, he,

1982
01:58:04,671 --> 01:58:09,470
it was either going to be
against him or Manuela,

1983
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:12,230
who was the first who is
supposed to fight first? Tiago.

1984
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:16,370
He was like someone pulled out of
that car, I'm not sure of that fight,

1985
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:19,580
someone pull out of it. And then they
offered me since I was already in Brazil,

1986
01:58:20,030 --> 01:58:23,570
but um, I think they needed a
Brazilian to fill the card, so, um,

1987
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:25,910
I couldn't do it.
So yeah,

1988
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:30,040
there's been times that I've been willing
to step in short notice, um, buffer.

1989
01:58:30,050 --> 01:58:30,883
Now I'm like,

1990
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:35,870
if what I've learned in four months has
been able to get me this far and a lot

1991
01:58:35,871 --> 01:58:38,840
like in my last fight,
then I'm going to go back and just get,

1992
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:41,030
get back to training so I can
be ready when they call me.

1993
01:58:41,890 --> 01:58:44,650
So what do you anticipate, how many
times would you like to fight a year?

1994
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:48,100
I want to fight at least two
more times this year. Yeah.

1995
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:51,250
So I've,

1996
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:54,130
I've got to learn what works for me,

1997
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:56,440
just based off the time,

1998
01:58:56,441 --> 01:59:00,070
put it into this camp and kind of this
new system that I can start to develop.

1999
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:04,780
So now just get back, start training
it, and then get into a fight camp.

2000
01:59:05,650 --> 01:59:10,420
So, and like, typically what do you
like do you like eight weeks, 12 weeks?

2001
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:12,100
Like what do you, what do you,
what do you need to provide?

2002
01:59:12,101 --> 01:59:16,600
I think eight weeks is perfect.
Yeah. Eight weeks is perfect.

2003
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:21,190
I'll take six weeks. Um, four
weeks feels kind of like,

2004
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:26,830
you know, like everything's Kinda
gotta be rushed. But uh, yeah,

2005
01:59:26,831 --> 01:59:29,020
I think six to eight weeks is perfect.

2006
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:31,030
And what do you do on from
recovery while you're out there?

2007
01:59:31,031 --> 01:59:35,800
You're doing Thai massage. Gentile
fair massages are so cheap. Yeah.

2008
01:59:35,820 --> 01:59:37,720
Like you can get two hour
time massage for yourself.

2009
01:59:37,721 --> 01:59:42,070
You can get two hour time
massage for maybe like 10 bucks,

2010
01:59:42,490 --> 01:59:47,030
two hours, full body, like elbows and
feet, everything. That's incredible.

2011
01:59:47,070 --> 01:59:51,790
Amazing. And then, um, they knew the ice
bath, but they put like big blocks of ice.

2012
01:59:51,791 --> 01:59:55,840
They don't put bags. So there's a bunch
of this ice baths and massages. That's it.

2013
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:59,860
The stretching. But uh, I really, uh,

2014
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:01,630
I really want to do something down there,

2015
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:05,950
like save some money and maybe get
like recovery place going. Like,

2016
02:00:05,951 --> 02:00:10,090
what kind of recovery? Please? I want to
bring something down there. I didn't even,

2017
02:00:10,150 --> 02:00:12,880
I wasn't going to get him out this
idea, but whatever. Who Cares? Um,

2018
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:18,880
I think because there's so much
stuff down there, uh, gyms, crossfit,

2019
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:20,750
restaurants, all that stuff. Uh,

2020
02:00:21,190 --> 02:00:24,580
I think the only thing that's
lacking is a proper recovery.

2021
02:00:25,330 --> 02:00:30,040
Crile called punch hot tub.
No massage.

2022
02:00:30,041 --> 02:00:35,020
Just like speedy recovery.
You've been in the Cryo, right?

2023
02:00:35,021 --> 02:00:36,190
Like, yeah, man,

2024
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:39,520
you can go after a hard session and go
cryo and go take a nap and you'll feel

2025
02:00:39,521 --> 02:00:43,720
pretty good. But the icepack
good. Just getting out of it.

2026
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:48,060
Do you feel the same way from
ice baths? A cold plunge? Yeah,

2027
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:50,170
like the one of the Pie.
That one's freezing cold.

2028
02:00:50,230 --> 02:00:53,920
I do a couple of minutes in
there and yeah. Um, the ice bath.

2029
02:00:53,921 --> 02:00:57,010
So in Thailand because
of the bricks are so big,

2030
02:00:57,040 --> 02:01:00,310
it takes a long time to really like fill
up and stuff so they don't get as cold.

2031
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:03,160
So I think I would love
to just to help out,

2032
02:01:03,161 --> 02:01:07,120
like help that little community and just
get something really like really good

2033
02:01:07,121 --> 02:01:10,390
in there for just recovery and
have, you know, maybe some,

2034
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:13,870
some type of smoothies or something
to help boost everything up,

2035
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:17,380
get the system running again so that
we can train multiple times a day.

2036
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:21,430
Now do you do anything to monitor your
heart rate or heart rate variability to

2037
02:01:21,431 --> 02:01:26,320
see if your overtrained or undertrained
see how you're feeling? Uh, yeah,

2038
02:01:26,321 --> 02:01:28,840
not as much as we did here at the UFC pie.
But uh,

2039
02:01:28,841 --> 02:01:33,841
I do have a heart rate monitor and for
this fight camp I use it only to um,

2040
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:39,960
make sure that I can get my weight down
because I got up to like two 35 and I

2041
02:01:40,341 --> 02:01:43,940
did this like the o two Max test
and I did all this stuff and this,

2042
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:46,450
this clinic down there helped me to um,

2043
02:01:46,730 --> 02:01:49,160
just understand when
my body's burning fat.

2044
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:52,700
So where to keep my heart rate and how
to monitor like when I'm actually working

2045
02:01:52,701 --> 02:01:56,060
hard enough to, to lose the weight
and it worked. So it was good.

2046
02:01:56,420 --> 02:02:00,760
It's such a different world now with
all these scientific inventions. Yeah.

2047
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:04,550
Different ways that they can make
sure that your body's in a good space.

2048
02:02:04,551 --> 02:02:05,840
It's not guesswork anymore.

2049
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:10,550
Make sure you're not overtrained or
hundred percent dealing with the same time

2050
02:02:10,551 --> 02:02:12,440
off.
The same time I was doing vo two Max,

2051
02:02:12,441 --> 02:02:16,490
they had a like a EKG going on everything.
So I'm like running,

2052
02:02:16,491 --> 02:02:19,940
they're making sure my heart's
pumping and my lungs are functioning,

2053
02:02:19,941 --> 02:02:22,160
everything all in sync.

2054
02:02:22,161 --> 02:02:25,160
And they gave me this whole big printout
of everything and everything seemed to

2055
02:02:25,161 --> 02:02:27,860
be working perfectly. So
they were just like, okay,

2056
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:30,680
well in order to lose this
much weight by this much,

2057
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:32,390
this is what you need to be at.

2058
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:36,050
And when your body's at the highest fat
burning stage is when your body's at or

2059
02:02:36,051 --> 02:02:41,051
when your heart rate's at like 178 for
me it was 178 ppms and so I did my best

2060
02:02:44,301 --> 02:02:47,120
to push. They're just, and I
at least know when I'm there,

2061
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:50,840
I'm burning the most fat so I'll try
to get there as much as possible.

2062
02:02:50,841 --> 02:02:54,820
You got to try and not do that again
as far as like get that heavy. Yeah,

2063
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:58,110
100% but getting,
getting that heavy too.

2064
02:02:58,111 --> 02:03:02,780
It was like I had lost the Johnnie Walker.
It got to Thailand. Oh, food sugary,

2065
02:03:02,781 --> 02:03:06,410
like all this stuff. So I just Kinda
like, I dunno what I'm fighting again. So,

2066
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:08,420
but now I'm ready to be active.

2067
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:12,440
That was a big part of my
decision to go there too. Uh,

2068
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:17,090
and stay there a year is I want to be
active this year to two fights, but

2069
02:03:18,860 --> 02:03:22,250
training. Where did they have you
ranked now? I don't think I am.

2070
02:03:22,580 --> 02:03:26,030
You don't think you're ranked even
Tom 15? No, definitely not. Hmm.

2071
02:03:26,450 --> 02:03:31,120
What do you think you should do in
terms of the next level of fight?

2072
02:03:31,121 --> 02:03:33,860
Are you face? Like what kind
of guy would you like to fight?

2073
02:03:35,510 --> 02:03:36,343
Yeah.

2074
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:41,090
Hmm Man,

2075
02:03:41,090 --> 02:03:43,340
that's crazy.
I don't even ask myself those questions.

2076
02:03:43,370 --> 02:03:47,210
What do you do you just wait for
the call? Yeah, I usually just, I,

2077
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:50,660
oh wait for the call and whoever they,

2078
02:03:51,020 --> 02:03:55,670
they usually offer to, they
had like two options. Really?

2079
02:03:56,090 --> 02:03:59,480
Yeah. Like how do you choose? Uh,

2080
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:04,280
usually they offer like,
like the last time it was okay,

2081
02:04:04,281 --> 02:04:08,270
there's Eric handers or there's a guy,
like, I didn't even know his name.

2082
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:14,080
Like this guy is going to be new coming
into the UFC and air candor's is like

2083
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:18,440
coming off a loss, blah, blah, blah. And
I'm like, okay, well socks. I know Eric,

2084
02:04:18,441 --> 02:04:18,951
all this stuff.

2085
02:04:18,951 --> 02:04:23,120
But I'd rather fight Eric because I've
already lost three times to guys who were

2086
02:04:23,121 --> 02:04:26,720
making their UFC debuts and it's just
not good for me. You know what I mean?

2087
02:04:26,721 --> 02:04:31,520
Like obviously they're tough.
They're hungry, they're
trying to get into the UFC,

2088
02:04:31,521 --> 02:04:33,860
it's going to be a really tough fight.
Um,

2089
02:04:35,060 --> 02:04:37,920
and so that's Kinda how I made the
decision. The last one I was like,

2090
02:04:37,921 --> 02:04:42,270
I don't want to take the risk of losing
another fight to a guy who was making

2091
02:04:42,271 --> 02:04:45,120
his debut because three
times it was enough for me.

2092
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:48,990
That's refreshing to be honest.
Yeah, that's what I mean.

2093
02:04:49,470 --> 02:04:51,540
It's like we were talking
about earlier about boxers,

2094
02:04:51,541 --> 02:04:55,680
having managers that have a strategy to
keep them undefeated as long as possible,

2095
02:04:55,681 --> 02:04:58,200
give them tests,
have them decide like,

2096
02:04:58,201 --> 02:05:01,590
when's the right time to take
this fight once you know what's,

2097
02:05:01,591 --> 02:05:03,810
what's the right thing to do.
And as a professional,

2098
02:05:03,811 --> 02:05:07,530
how much of an advantage is it to
know what a guy does? Know who he is.

2099
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:12,180
I've seen him fight a bunch of
times. Been around them. Uh, it's,

2100
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:15,720
I just like, just for instance, um,

2101
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:19,770
like I fought go con Saki and then
they offered me Johnny Walker.

2102
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:24,900
And so like Johnny Walker was coming off
contender series, but still nobody knew.

2103
02:05:25,290 --> 02:05:29,340
Like not even, we knew we saw his
highlights, but we're like, oh well,

2104
02:05:29,910 --> 02:05:34,560
like this look at the competition
that he's faced. Right. You know,

2105
02:05:34,561 --> 02:05:38,150
so we didn't really get to see much of
what he was capable of. So I'm like, ah,

2106
02:05:38,190 --> 02:05:41,700
okay. If that's all you got,
then I'll take the fight by then.

2107
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,970
Here comes Johnny Walker. This like
raging beast. You'd only be like,

2108
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:48,000
the guy's huge. So, um,

2109
02:05:50,190 --> 02:05:51,660
yeah, it was just, it was weird. Like,

2110
02:05:51,690 --> 02:05:54,270
so I went from beating go
hockey to losing Johnnie Walker.

2111
02:05:54,271 --> 02:05:56,490
Thank God Johnny Walker
has been as good as,

2112
02:05:56,491 --> 02:06:01,320
he hasn't has made a name for
himself, but still like, yeah,

2113
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:02,880
I just didn't want to be like a,

2114
02:06:02,970 --> 02:06:06,450
I guess like a a foot in
or what do they call it?

2115
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:12,330
Like a a journeyman. Yeah. Not a
journeymen, but like when they said like,

2116
02:06:12,331 --> 02:06:15,020
you're trying to get like your foot in
the door or something like that, like

2117
02:06:17,220 --> 02:06:21,180
someone said it on, on Instagram, I
saw it like a few times, but um, yeah,

2118
02:06:21,181 --> 02:06:25,500
I just didn't want to like
just be another guy that,

2119
02:06:26,210 --> 02:06:30,180
you know, what could possibly
give somebody their shot
into the UFC. I was like,

2120
02:06:30,181 --> 02:06:32,670
Oh, let me fight a guy that's
in the UFC this time. Well,

2121
02:06:32,671 --> 02:06:35,370
so now that you did and you had
the fight with Eric Anderson,

2122
02:06:35,371 --> 02:06:40,300
you have this spectacular result and now
you know, people recognizing that you,

2123
02:06:40,301 --> 02:06:44,820
you, you've made some big improvement.
Like what caliber fighter, like who, who,

2124
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:48,600
who do you think would propel your career?
Like what would be the best next step?

2125
02:06:49,230 --> 02:06:50,063
Uh,

2126
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:55,180
I mean definitely I think it's time for
me to break somewhere into the top 15

2127
02:06:55,990 --> 02:07:00,580
you know, for sure nowhere in the
guys that are at the very top because

2128
02:07:02,630 --> 02:07:05,850
they're all kind of tie it up. They're
all pretty tied up, you know? And I,

2129
02:07:05,851 --> 02:07:10,440
I definitely think it'll be a while
before I can actually fight Jones because

2130
02:07:10,441 --> 02:07:13,410
just like how things are,
how things are laid out.

2131
02:07:13,411 --> 02:07:17,760
Like I know for sure Johnny walkers
ranked and he's already kind of like in

2132
02:07:17,761 --> 02:07:19,620
talks like he's the guy to be Jon Jones,

2133
02:07:19,621 --> 02:07:22,530
so sure they're going to
try to set that up right.

2134
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:26,270
And then there's like kind of the
set of guys in the middle, um,

2135
02:07:26,430 --> 02:07:29,190
to Johnnie Walker fucking shoulder
up and who's doing that worm thing?

2136
02:07:29,490 --> 02:07:32,340
Supposedly. Supposedly.
But I think he's fine.

2137
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:36,010
I think he's fine because I've had
people call me in like, Hey, I just

2138
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:38,860
see this Johnny Walker guy down down,
like on the street everyday.

2139
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:40,440
I guess he's back in Thailand now.

2140
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:44,470
So he did that flop around
thing and then he could,

2141
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:45,790
when he got up he couldn't move.

2142
02:07:45,791 --> 02:07:48,640
His shoulder dislocate is
located or something like that.

2143
02:07:48,641 --> 02:07:52,850
I think that's what happened.
That's so insane after, right? Yeah.

2144
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:57,430
I think you called it out like most like
what's going on, man. Yeah, he's um,

2145
02:07:57,790 --> 02:08:00,980
I hope he doesn't, didn't permanently
injured his shoulder. Nah,

2146
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,310
I think you might be
fine. I hope so. Yeah.

2147
02:08:03,311 --> 02:08:05,470
He's not walking around in a
slag or anything right now,

2148
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:08,440
but he could have a little, but
yeah, after your fight with him,

2149
02:08:08,441 --> 02:08:10,160
he's made quite an account of himself.
Yeah.

2150
02:08:10,330 --> 02:08:13,660
That last fight with that flying
knee was insane. Yeah. So I'm sure.

2151
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:17,320
I'm sure before I get to the top I'd have
to find a game. Right. What's up Jim?

2152
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:18,350
Yeah, I would imagine. Yeah.

2153
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:22,900
Is currently recuperating
from his shoulder surgery
after dislocating shoulder

2154
02:08:22,901 --> 02:08:27,790
surgery. Dude, two shoulder surgery.

2155
02:08:28,690 --> 02:08:31,080
That's fucked up.
Crazy.

2156
02:08:31,180 --> 02:08:35,170
I've never known anybody to have shoulder
surgery and come back like with a full,

2157
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:36,590
fully Andre Ward.

2158
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:39,670
Andrew Ward had shoulder surgery
and came back better than ever.

2159
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:43,420
But he's also got the best
doctors. Sure. To make a long time.

2160
02:08:43,450 --> 02:08:44,740
Two months from a comeback
because what he says,

2161
02:08:44,741 --> 02:08:48,160
he hopes to fight the Winter
Gustafson, Anthony's, Thomas Smith.

2162
02:08:48,310 --> 02:08:52,960
He better take his time. It doesn't
want of a fucking shoulder up forever,

2163
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:57,040
you know, if it rips again, that's a
great fight. Anthony Smith and Gustafson,

2164
02:08:57,130 --> 02:09:00,050
that's a great fight. And you
know, Anthony Smith Account, he,

2165
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:03,700
he really held his own, like he made a
good account of himself in that fight.

2166
02:09:03,701 --> 02:09:08,080
He didn't win the fight, but you know,
he showed everybody how tactical he is,

2167
02:09:08,081 --> 02:09:11,290
especially in that first round.
Yeah, for sure. Real good and sharp.

2168
02:09:11,470 --> 02:09:14,620
John's just pat her. It was just,
John's just better, you know,

2169
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:18,100
I mean for now he just has his number.
I mean,

2170
02:09:18,101 --> 02:09:20,440
in the John Jones that you're
seeing now is a Jon Jones.

2171
02:09:20,441 --> 02:09:24,210
It sort of has like a real goal in mind.
But yeah,

2172
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:26,350
he's had it taken away
from him and it gave,

2173
02:09:26,351 --> 02:09:29,680
they gave it back to him and now he knows
he has it and he's capitalizing on it.

2174
02:09:29,710 --> 02:09:34,390
It seems like it, it's just like he knows
what it's like to be, to be the best,

2175
02:09:34,391 --> 02:09:37,240
but not be able to, to really
like do anything about it. Right.

2176
02:09:37,270 --> 02:09:40,720
For a long amount of time.
Yeah. So I think it's,

2177
02:09:40,721 --> 02:09:43,360
I think it's pretty cool to be able
to see this version of them and,

2178
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:46,750
and to be active around
this time. Maybe, you know,

2179
02:09:46,810 --> 02:09:49,600
maybe I'll get a shot or maybe
he'll still be around at the top.

2180
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:52,120
Like whenever I get my shot.
When you see how it goes.

2181
02:09:52,210 --> 02:09:55,570
If you had a timeline in your head of
when you think you'd be ready to challenge

2182
02:09:55,571 --> 02:09:57,070
for a title,
when do you think it would be?

2183
02:09:57,620 --> 02:09:59,480
Uh,
oh,

2184
02:10:02,410 --> 02:10:07,270
I can give it another year. Yeah.

2185
02:10:07,810 --> 02:10:11,030
I think I can get one,
one more year,

2186
02:10:11,031 --> 02:10:16,031
a year and a half of good solid fights
in to really solidify myself and just in

2187
02:10:18,671 --> 02:10:21,130
the UFC and uh,

2188
02:10:22,850 --> 02:10:25,820
and just put in the work and
everything that, that it,

2189
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:31,000
that it takes to really embody what I
think it would be like what I think it

2190
02:10:31,521 --> 02:10:35,240
would take to be a champion as champion.
Not just like get the belt and lose it,

2191
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:38,690
you know, like give the
bell and then, and then, uh,

2192
02:10:40,730 --> 02:10:42,740
just be a champion for,
you know, a couple months.

2193
02:10:42,741 --> 02:10:46,670
Like not to actually be a champion
and, and, and hold it down.

2194
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:48,990
I think little ovary,

2195
02:10:49,690 --> 02:10:54,130
well it's an unbelievably
talent rich wig class. Right?

2196
02:10:54,131 --> 02:10:58,750
Cause to me a still kind of in it
[inaudible] Jon Jones is the champion.

2197
02:10:59,070 --> 02:11:01,540
You know, he just got off the
Anthony Smith Phi Anthony Smith,

2198
02:11:01,541 --> 02:11:03,460
Gustafson Gustafson,
still a beast.

2199
02:11:03,910 --> 02:11:08,910
But no one is like really standing out
as being like this person that everybody

2200
02:11:09,521 --> 02:11:12,430
wants to see challenge for the title.
You've got worthy challengers,

2201
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:13,300
they're good fights,

2202
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:18,370
but there's no one that you're seeing
them except Cormier was the only one we

2203
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:21,520
seen him versus John, you're like, Whoa,
what the fuck is gonna happen here?

2204
02:11:21,790 --> 02:11:25,360
What's going to happen here? And that's
what the division needs I think. Yeah, no,

2205
02:11:25,690 --> 02:11:26,480
definitely.

2206
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:28,340
And that's something that,

2207
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:34,570
that I can also see and that's something
that I also want to do that for myself.

2208
02:11:36,261 --> 02:11:36,531
I just,

2209
02:11:36,531 --> 02:11:40,490
I want to be the best version and I'm
starting to find out what that's like,

2210
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:44,150
especially with like the happy,
like being able to do what I,

2211
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:46,480
what I want to do and strike high.
I want to strike itself.

2212
02:11:46,490 --> 02:11:49,460
So now like let's get some, some
fights in there to mix it up. Yeah.

2213
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:52,700
Really like test that
test. If it works, test,

2214
02:11:52,701 --> 02:11:56,650
if that's really going to be able to,
to sustain and,

2215
02:11:56,870 --> 02:11:59,120
and what it takes to get to get there.
You know what I mean?

2216
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:01,690
Like I'm willing to test it. Like if
they want to put me up against the,

2217
02:12:02,310 --> 02:12:07,040
the best grappler in the world and things
that I'll have no chance on the ground.

2218
02:12:07,070 --> 02:12:10,310
Okay, cool. Or if they want to put
me against, well they already did.

2219
02:12:10,370 --> 02:12:15,370
They thought I wouldn't stand a chance
against Gokhan Saki and like I was very

2220
02:12:15,711 --> 02:12:17,840
happy for that because I go,
I'm like okay cool.

2221
02:12:17,841 --> 02:12:22,340
I get to test the best of my abilities.
Like there's like against a legend. Yeah.

2222
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:26,450
I didn't like, I knew that I had
everything it took to beat him but I,

2223
02:12:26,690 --> 02:12:30,380
I didn't think like Ah, he's going
to destroy me. No, never. Like,

2224
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:33,080
so I want to continue to be tested.

2225
02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:37,530
It's an interesting your approach because
I wonder if the fact that you were

2226
02:12:37,531 --> 02:12:42,531
such a non confrontational guy and you
are really easy going helps you and that

2227
02:12:42,721 --> 02:12:47,480
you have like less conflict in your head.
I also,

2228
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:50,730
I'm also wander because even the way you
approach like these different match ups

2229
02:12:50,731 --> 02:12:53,940
and everything you like,
you kind of put your ego aside,

2230
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:56,310
you're looking at the like what
does the smart thing to do here?

2231
02:12:56,490 --> 02:12:59,130
A smart thing to do is not take this
fight against this newcomer guy where he

2232
02:12:59,131 --> 02:13:01,050
lost a newcomer guys.
The smart thing is,

2233
02:13:01,051 --> 02:13:04,590
okay we realize that Thailand
was extremely beneficial.

2234
02:13:04,591 --> 02:13:08,340
Let's fucking move to Thailand. Yeah.
So you're doing all these like really,

2235
02:13:08,580 --> 02:13:11,900
really smart moves where you know,
you're,

2236
02:13:11,901 --> 02:13:14,190
you're looking at it very logically,

2237
02:13:14,191 --> 02:13:16,830
but you have confidence in
yourself but you're not,

2238
02:13:16,831 --> 02:13:19,110
you don't really not like a braggy guy.
You know,

2239
02:13:19,111 --> 02:13:21,540
you're getting everything
done with your work. You know,

2240
02:13:21,541 --> 02:13:23,910
you're getting everything done
with your results. It's uh,

2241
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,990
it's interesting to see maybe cause you
want to see as many different kinds of

2242
02:13:27,991 --> 02:13:30,750
fighters as possible and you're
like a new kind of thing.

2243
02:13:30,990 --> 02:13:32,250
That's the most important

2244
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:34,830
thing though, man. Like I, I don't,

2245
02:13:35,310 --> 02:13:40,310
I don't really tune in too much UFC and
like what's going on because of that

2246
02:13:40,861 --> 02:13:44,400
reason. Right. I don't care about
what people have to say in this.

2247
02:13:44,850 --> 02:13:48,120
I don't watch fighting to hear
what people have to say, you know,

2248
02:13:48,121 --> 02:13:51,480
like I didn't fight. Like it's not
about talking, it's about fighting.

2249
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:55,740
And the only thing that I can prove and
have to prove is what I can do with my

2250
02:13:55,741 --> 02:13:59,730
skills. That's it. You know?
So like if they put me,

2251
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:04,620
they put me against any type
of other fighter. Like if,

2252
02:14:04,621 --> 02:14:07,020
let's go back to the roots
of mixed martial arts,

2253
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:08,880
let's go back to the roots of UFC.

2254
02:14:08,881 --> 02:14:12,300
Like when guys weren't even the same
size and they were just matching up

2255
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:16,050
different martial arts, like
be down for that. I mean,

2256
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:21,350
I'd consider it and if the, if it,
if it had to happen now, like yeah,

2257
02:14:21,430 --> 02:14:24,450
I definitely think about it and I'd
probably lean more towards doing it and

2258
02:14:24,451 --> 02:14:27,270
saying, no. Do you have
guys trash talk you

2259
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:33,450
like you're pretty easy going guy. Easy
going. It's, it's nothing to my face.

2260
02:14:33,451 --> 02:14:36,810
It's always subtle. If, if I ever
hear about anybody saying something,

2261
02:14:36,811 --> 02:14:39,500
it's just through word of mouth and
I'm just like, yeah, we'll, we'll,

2262
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:44,010
you never had like a Conor McGregor
type incident where always only in the

2263
02:14:44,011 --> 02:14:47,700
beginning with Paul Craig,
but I think it was just,

2264
02:14:49,050 --> 02:14:53,790
it was just like his thing. We've
like, we smashed that beef, you know?

2265
02:14:53,900 --> 02:14:57,930
That's good. Yeah. But what do you think
about trash talking in this day and age?

2266
02:14:57,931 --> 02:14:59,470
Because in, in many ways, look,

2267
02:14:59,471 --> 02:15:02,190
Connor is an amazing fighter
and his fighting skills,

2268
02:15:02,191 --> 02:15:04,830
what's made him such an
international superstar,

2269
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:07,530
but he'll also talk some mad shit.

2270
02:15:07,531 --> 02:15:10,560
And that helped him too because he
was so good at it. It was funny.

2271
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:15,630
He would say funny mean and salting
shit. It was fucking great. 100%. Yeah.

2272
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:19,320
But I think what people forget, Joe
is I like, that's always been Connor.

2273
02:15:19,350 --> 02:15:23,700
Even when you go and, and,
and, and look at the, the,

2274
02:15:23,701 --> 02:15:26,910
the interviews from before he was a,
in the UFC and he was just like,

2275
02:15:26,911 --> 02:15:29,100
I'm going to make a bunch of money.
I'm going to be all this.

2276
02:15:29,101 --> 02:15:33,540
And so if like he created
that for himself and yeah,

2277
02:15:33,541 --> 02:15:37,650
he made a bunch of money from talking
trash because he always had a plan that

2278
02:15:37,651 --> 02:15:40,350
that's was, that's what
he was going to do. Yeah.

2279
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:44,100
And so I think people try to hop on it
just to sell tickets or gain money and

2280
02:15:44,101 --> 02:15:44,911
sometimes it works.

2281
02:15:44,911 --> 02:15:48,390
It gets people wanting to watch and it
gets your name up and stuff like that.

2282
02:15:48,391 --> 02:15:51,720
But that's not the time.
But name I want to make for myself,

2283
02:15:51,721 --> 02:15:53,820
like I don't like people
talking trash to me.

2284
02:15:53,821 --> 02:15:57,450
So I'm not really gonna talk trash to
anybody unless there's something that's

2285
02:15:57,750 --> 02:16:01,560
really personal. But if I don't
know you and I don't care about you,

2286
02:16:01,620 --> 02:16:04,890
then I don't really consider it.
If like why would I talk trash?

2287
02:16:04,891 --> 02:16:06,240
I don't even care about you.

2288
02:16:09,570 --> 02:16:10,680
It's a waste of energy.

2289
02:16:10,681 --> 02:16:15,681
It's a waste of like I got so much
other stuff to care about her.

2290
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:21,500
Yeah. It was a very healthy look, man.
I mean, so the way you saying that,

2291
02:16:21,550 --> 02:16:23,040
he said healthy,
like I like,

2292
02:16:23,060 --> 02:16:28,060
I like to maintain a healthy heart and
mind as much as possible to its damn man.

2293
02:16:30,191 --> 02:16:33,580
Like mental health is a real thing
like this, you know what I mean?

2294
02:16:33,610 --> 02:16:38,080
And especially like, especially
just having certain obligations and,

2295
02:16:38,770 --> 02:16:43,240
and just using social media and having
people reach out and they say like, oh,

2296
02:16:43,241 --> 02:16:44,900
ignore this, ignore
that. But it's like, man,

2297
02:16:44,901 --> 02:16:48,460
it's like I'm s it's hard to just
ignore certain things, you know,

2298
02:16:48,461 --> 02:16:53,350
like you still see things and so just
that and condition of the world and just

2299
02:16:53,351 --> 02:16:54,071
everything,
man,

2300
02:16:54,071 --> 02:16:58,120
being in multiple different countries
and here in this news and that news and

2301
02:16:58,121 --> 02:17:00,550
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Like for a person who like,

2302
02:17:01,030 --> 02:17:04,690
who wants to care about the world,
they're just genuinely cares,

2303
02:17:04,691 --> 02:17:07,870
like a lot can go on in my
mind. So I'm just like, ah,

2304
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:09,160
I don't even want that in my heart,
man.

2305
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:12,880
I'm just going to do my best to
kind of keep my own peace and uh,

2306
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:18,610
come fight time. I let it loose, dude.
I liked the way you live it, man.

2307
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:23,200
You got a great approach, man. That's
it. Appreciate happiness is important.

2308
02:17:23,350 --> 02:17:27,580
It is, man. It's a great message too,
man. And the tab would come from you. God,

2309
02:17:27,610 --> 02:17:28,990
I love those kinds of stories.

2310
02:17:28,991 --> 02:17:32,830
Where guys life was fall fucked
up and you figured it out man.

2311
02:17:33,340 --> 02:17:34,930
And you put it together,
man.

2312
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:40,100
Tell me like nothing feels
better than just like being
fucking happy. Yeah, right?

2313
02:17:40,140 --> 02:17:43,510
Like when you're just, when you're okay
with your life and you're okay with your,

2314
02:17:43,570 --> 02:17:48,010
your, your, your, your heart and your
integrity. When you just feel like,

2315
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:52,180
you know what, I have not, I haven't
done anything wrong. I'm, I'm okay.

2316
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:55,480
I like life is happening the
way it is and I have not,

2317
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:59,200
I don't have to think about did I fuck
this person over? Do I do this? Like no,

2318
02:17:59,230 --> 02:18:03,410
everything is okay. Yeah. So why
welcome anything else? Like no man,

2319
02:18:03,730 --> 02:18:06,460
clear mind, clear heart.
It's a rare thing.

2320
02:18:06,461 --> 02:18:10,600
It's rare feat to achieve balance
and balance is hard to maintain.

2321
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:14,110
So it's like, it takes a little bit
of fighting. It takes meditation,

2322
02:18:14,111 --> 02:18:14,950
it takes anger,

2323
02:18:14,951 --> 02:18:18,700
it takes like Yin and Yang is the most
beautiful thing ever been like that is

2324
02:18:18,701 --> 02:18:21,940
life, that is life. It
really is the opposite.

2325
02:18:21,941 --> 02:18:25,000
The balance of opposites is constant.
The constant flow.

2326
02:18:25,420 --> 02:18:30,310
Like that's why I love just reading
like the Tao Te Ching and like just like

2327
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:35,090
Kundalini Yoga, like all the like cool,
like spiritual stuff. I'm like, yeah man,

2328
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:40,030
this is it. Like it just helps me to just
kind of reach for this like this piece,

2329
02:18:40,031 --> 02:18:41,890
this light. That's just, that's awesome.

2330
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:45,210
Do you see the contradiction and reaching
for that piece and light while you're

2331
02:18:45,211 --> 02:18:49,640
smashing people? Yes. And that's
not, that's life. That's life man.

2332
02:18:49,660 --> 02:18:53,190
That's life. You know, like like a
battery. Right. In order for it to,

2333
02:18:53,510 --> 02:18:56,980
to give its power, like it's got
to have the negative and positive,

2334
02:18:57,310 --> 02:18:59,710
like energy's flowing
through it and it's like,

2335
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:03,850
I feel like a lot of the times
people are too focused on one side,

2336
02:19:03,851 --> 02:19:08,851
like too much negative or
too much positive and you
needed a good amount of both

2337
02:19:09,191 --> 02:19:13,210
in order for that. Like that, that
energy to spark. So well said.

2338
02:19:13,660 --> 02:19:17,530
You're a wise man. I appreciate
you, man, and thanks for
coming on the show. And, um,

2339
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:20,690
I can't wait to, uh, do commentary
for warranty fights again, man.

2340
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:22,540
Can't wait to have you there.
It's really fun animation.

2341
02:19:22,810 --> 02:19:26,770
We had a good fucking time and that was
great. Thank you. Thank you. Smacked

2342
02:19:30,730 --> 02:19:31,450
it was great,
man.
