1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,470
A lot of people like when they do,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,191
you know,

3
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:03,001
like did you stand up?

4
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:03,691
They do jokes.

5
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:08,430
Is very few people telling like long
stories like you do that or the best

6
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:10,380
favorite shoe was that
like did the Berlin,

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,480
was that Berlin would do both.

8
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:13,171
He would mix it up.

9
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:14,550
He'd do and what not.

10
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:15,001
Jokes,

11
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:15,281
jokes.

12
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:15,560
Highland.

13
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,650
We do like one liners.

14
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:16,950
You know,

15
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,540
he did whatever he thought was funny.

16
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,340
Sam Kass and bill Cosby
though was probably the most
influential bill Cosby and

17
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,174
oddly enough,

18
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,650
Spalding gray.

19
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,440
Probably the most influential.

20
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:28,141
What happened to that guy?

21
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:28,860
Didn't he die?

22
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,730
He killed himself.

23
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,600
Yeah,

24
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,290
I think he,

25
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:31,591
well,

26
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:32,424
I think,

27
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,690
you know,

28
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,950
I don't know if he could
prove that sort of thing,

29
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,890
but they think he drowned
himself off the ferry.

30
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,511
He didn't get,

31
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:40,380
it obviously had a lot of issues,

32
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,460
issues and whatnot,

33
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:42,300
but I enjoy,

34
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,030
joy has his readings.

35
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,170
If you've never heard
or listened to theirs,

36
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,830
you can listen to terrors of pleasure,

37
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,690
monster and a box.

38
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:52,980
Of course he eats in a box,

39
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,930
came to prominence with a,

40
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:59,520
it was swimming to Cambodia but monster
and a box is fucking riveting and it's

41
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:03,540
literally a dude telling a
long story and I loved it.

42
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,530
It's like an hour and a half,

43
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,230
two hours maybe or something like great
to have something different like that

44
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,330
and he just let you sit
there and you can't,

45
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:11,670
I mean you can watch a video
version of that that believe exists,

46
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,280
but I always listened to
it and it was just magical.

47
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:19,281
The idea of like a dude who's essentially
telling one very long joke that's has

48
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,850
highs and lows,

49
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:23,730
emotional beats and makes
you sad and that gets real.

50
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:27,480
Like every once in a while he throws and
you're laughing and he'll just stop you

51
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:29,910
dead with like my mother
killed herself and you know,

52
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:30,744
Blah Blah Blah.

53
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,290
And he just derails the
comedy and you forget like,

54
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:34,711
Oh shit,

55
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:35,610
this dude's not a comic.

56
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:36,930
He's literally storytelling.

57
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,240
And so I appreciated
that and I appreciate it.

58
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,050
Bill Cosby,

59
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,910
my favorite comedy bits of all time is
the one side of that album to Russel,

60
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,280
my brother who has slept with it's,

61
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:48,300
I don't know if you've ever heard it,

62
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:50,280
but it's so fucking hysterical.

63
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:54,690
It's bill Cosby's I guess how long was
the side of a record back in the day for

64
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,860
40 minutes or something.

65
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,090
45 one side.

66
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:57,780
I don't remember.

67
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,040
30 member man maybe.

68
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,021
Cause he was,

69
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,430
he wouldn't flip sides when
you had a good long record.

70
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:02,970
Right Faye?

71
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm want to say 30 minutes Max.

72
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:05,461
I don't know.

73
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:06,201
But this should be,

74
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,250
she Google this for somebody
going here in this room.

75
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,660
This piece is the whole side of an
album and it's essentially him telling a

76
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:16,140
story about him and his little
brother trying to go to sleep.

77
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,460
Um,

78
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,730
when they were kids and the
interplay with their father.

79
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,050
And it's so,

80
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,411
it is,

81
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:26,430
it's spellbinding like he paints the
picture puts you're right there in the

82
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:26,671
room.

83
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,810
He never curses.

84
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:28,470
Dude.

85
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,610
Never uses a sexual innuendo,

86
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,631
nothing.

87
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:37,320
Not Know are the tricks that like
if I had to do it straight like him,

88
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:38,170
I could never have done.

89
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,113
Never have done it.

90
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,560
Still can't do it to this day.

91
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,710
And he drops science for that entire bit.

92
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:44,544
It is,

93
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,420
it's brilliant.

94
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:46,800
It's so low.

95
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,910
It's hysterical.

96
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:51,840
He's absolutely adorable as the kids
and he's playing both of them and stuff.

97
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,280
Do yourself a favor,

98
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:53,911
listen to it.

99
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:56,040
That was very inspirational for me too.

100
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:56,401
I was like,

101
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:56,641
look,

102
00:02:56,641 --> 00:03:00,010
I could do this if this
was kind of comedy.

103
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,970
I think I could do this.

104
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,340
If you could tell Lawrence Long stories,

105
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,030
even as chicken hearts shit,

106
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,210
the go cards bit is fat Albert Buck,

107
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,370
Buck and the ninth street bridge a bit.

108
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,840
Bill Cosby stuff is,

109
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,030
I know some people maybe
aren't into them now,

110
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,560
but oh my God,

111
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,910
before he did that show long,

112
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,200
even though I go listen to the albums,

113
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,110
the allies or even now today,

114
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:21,190
stand up is still great.

115
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:24,700
I've heard people that like Chris Rock
was on TV talking about it once about how

116
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:25,780
he'd just gone to see him.

117
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:26,650
And uh,

118
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,071
he was,

119
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:27,370
um,

120
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,750
I think it was in the movie comedian,

121
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,820
the Jerry Seinfeld movie.

122
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,370
Think that's what it,

123
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:30,531
so,

124
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:31,690
which wasn't that long ago,

125
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,680
10 years ago.

126
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,331
Said the costume,

127
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:34,300
he was still sharp.

128
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,961
He said,

129
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:35,794
he goes,

130
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,581
Chris Rock,

131
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:37,490
who's one of the greatest ever.

132
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,333
I was like,

133
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,220
I feel like a fraud.

134
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,761
He goes,

135
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,420
I feel like a fraud.

136
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,253
After watching them,

137
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:41,741
he goes,

138
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:46,660
he just went up no opener for like two
hours and he did two shows and you know,

139
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,580
Bill Cosby's elderly gentleman.

140
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,630
I was going to say at this point,

141
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:52,480
he's gotta be like 70
still up there killing it.

142
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,620
And the crazy thing is,

143
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:56,050
I don't even think he goes
anywhere to try shit out.

144
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,080
I think he just writes it
all down right to it at home,

145
00:03:59,081 --> 00:03:59,710
you know?

146
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,850
And then he even said it like he does
stand up on the tonight show and he

147
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,740
literally doesn't practice the standup.

148
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,221
He goes,

149
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:07,090
I know what's funny.

150
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,250
I especially at now,

151
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,150
boy,

152
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,990
crazy is that like,

153
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,321
I know,

154
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:11,621
it's funny,

155
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:13,420
I'm just going to write
out my entire monologue.

156
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,170
He's a,

157
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,100
he's an old master.

158
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:15,670
You know,

159
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,920
Bill Cosby will be a great guy if someone,

160
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,730
I mean,

161
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,450
I wouldn't subscribe to all of his
principals because he's really into clean

162
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:25,040
comedy and I really appreciate
good dirty comedy too.

163
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,511
I'm sorry.

164
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,430
I appreciate good clean
comedy and like again,

165
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,630
he's a master master.

166
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,710
I can't do it,

167
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,480
but that's not my favorite.

168
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,350
I gotta be honest.

169
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:32,461
I,

170
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:32,650
I,

171
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,920
if I had a choice between listening to
Kozian Kennison one of the reasons why we

172
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,570
choose Kennison is cause he would go deep.

173
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,760
He would go take me to crazy places.

174
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,690
And that's what I want to do.

175
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:41,830
I've got a couple of drinks in me.

176
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:42,140
I want,

177
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,640
I want to hear you talk about
Jesus's last might words,

178
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,630
but not my,

179
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,133
I mean,

180
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,230
I want to talk about Philly.

181
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:50,980
Yeah.

182
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,310
Talk about like heat.

183
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,120
The relationship shit he did was really,

184
00:04:55,121 --> 00:05:00,121
really fucking Carlin Carlin and his
book and that sort of biography book.

185
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:01,980
I think he talks about Kennison.

186
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,900
Either that or I was watching an
interview the Carlin did with,

187
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,060
um,

188
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,620
uh,

189
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,650
John Stewart before he was just,

190
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,484
or Jon Stewart.

191
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,270
Um,

192
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,450
for some anniversary or some
maybe it aspen comedy fest,

193
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,230
and he said that Kennison was the
one that made him step his game up.

194
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,010
Wow.

195
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,910
Karlyn was just like,

196
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:21,430
when I see he's a very
rarely to like a comic,

197
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:22,211
like bomb away,

198
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:24,820
but he loved comics,

199
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,830
but Kinison was the one that made him go,

200
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:27,450
oh shit.

201
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,181
Like I should have,

202
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:29,200
why didn't I do that?

203
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:29,890
You know,

204
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,780
why don't you move to
where the fucking food is?

205
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,940
Did you ever read his brother's book?

206
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,360
No.

207
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,990
How is it?

208
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,710
It's awesome.

209
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,340
It's called Bro.

210
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,810
My brother Sam is very Sam,

211
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:38,644
very honest,

212
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,880
very honest and very,

213
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,541
very insightful.

214
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,710
But one of the things that he says is it,

215
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:43,810
Sam got hit by a car
when he was a little boy,

216
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,030
I think it was a truck
and after he got hit,

217
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,500
he was never the same kid again.

218
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,390
All of a sudden he was angry and reckless.

219
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,960
So he literally became Sam Kennison
because they got hit by a car.

220
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,120
They said before that it
was like a normal kid.

221
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,620
But then after he got hit,

222
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:58,280
all of a sudden became like reckless

223
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,910
and wild,

224
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,190
which sometimes happens when
people have head injuries.

225
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,911
That's a,

226
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:02,221
yeah,

227
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:06,770
that is crazy because a head injury
might've created one of the greatest

228
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,990
comedians in the history
of the known universe.

229
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,873
Right.

230
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,580
For Real.

231
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,090
It's true.

232
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,860
It's crazy to think
because he was so wild.

233
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,261
Man.

234
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:15,621
Silent.

235
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,670
Bob Wears a coat.

236
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:19,010
Like I wore that trench coat
because of Sam Kennison.

237
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,520
Really?

238
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,180
Oh my God.

239
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,621
I love that.

240
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:21,230
That's awesome.

241
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,590
And I had a poster in my room as a kid,

242
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,640
like he had done,

243
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,070
I don't even know how they
fucking got him to do this,

244
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,140
but they had in school,

245
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:30,590
this is,

246
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,850
they started this in school,

247
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:32,840
advertise and shit.

248
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,870
Even back then we're talking 1988 and
they'd have billboards where they would

249
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:42,200
put posters in where there was some
celebrity talking about read and it was

250
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,950
sponsored by some fucking company
and should everyone made out somehow.

251
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,230
But ultimately the message was good.

252
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:51,770
Whatever the message was meant to be
for high school or passing by in the

253
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:52,604
hallway.

254
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,400
Sam Kennison was on one of them.

255
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,880
And to think about that Sam Kinison
and inspirational high school poster.

256
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,891
It was just kind of,

257
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:03,800
if you've no Sam kinisons work at all,

258
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:04,790
it's just lunacy.

259
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,330
Wow.

260
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,410
I don't know how it happened.

261
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:08,840
He must have had a hell of an
agent or manager who's like,

262
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,190
I got you this Gig.

263
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:12,170
And I dunno if anyone remembers it,

264
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:13,004
but May.

265
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,960
But I remember I was a huge fan.

266
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:16,220
I'd seen him on Snl,

267
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:18,200
like he did that fucking crushing.

268
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,330
I'd seen him around the
Rodney Dangerfield special,

269
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,850
but on SNL he came out and he fucking,

270
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:24,500
they had to bleep them and shit like that.

271
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:25,760
He was legendary already.

272
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,680
And there he was in this poster.

273
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,970
And I remember going to
the principal and be like,

274
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:30,410
can I have this when they take it down?

275
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,590
And so he gave me the poster and I had
it in my room for the longest time.

276
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:36,110
And even though it was like
he couldn't curse on it,

277
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:36,651
it was about,

278
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:36,921
you know,

279
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:38,930
fucking doing your best or whatever,

280
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,920
being your own person.

281
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,920
It was classic Kinison Yell Pose,

282
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,560
you know,

283
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:43,970
of the,

284
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:44,750
ah,

285
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,520
so I had it in my room.

286
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,350
I start wearing trench coats because
Kennison he made a little Paris.

287
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,510
We went up to New York City to when they,

288
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:53,990
uh,

289
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,430
in Manhattan down in the village.

290
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,620
Was that place like vintage,

291
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,700
not vintage vinyl.

292
00:07:58,701 --> 00:07:59,660
I'd be a record store,

293
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:00,980
but it was about clothes,

294
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,121
old clothes,

295
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:05,660
vintage clothes and bought
old trench coats and shit.

296
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,150
Trying to look like Sam Kinison.

297
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,540
Wow.

298
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,300
Is there a return of Jay and silent
Bob in the work anytime ever?

299
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,691
No.

300
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,100
We do the podcast now.

301
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:16,930
We've kind of taken the
character's and turn them into,

302
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,490
I guess title more than anything else.

303
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,810
Did you ever have a script for it?

304
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:21,031
And like,

305
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:22,190
I like another one.

306
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,120
There was like,

307
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,490
no,

308
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,530
there was no script for it.

309
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:26,960
But like every once in a
while you'd muse about like,

310
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,180
well maybe this would
be funny or I'd do this.

311
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:32,570
And they started getting more and more
ridiculous and that's what I knew it was

312
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:33,141
time to stop.

313
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:34,430
Plus we're getting older.

314
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,620
It's kind of tough to pull
that off at like fucking,

315
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,300
I love it.

316
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,091
40 yeah,

317
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:38,371
did,

318
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:39,560
but don't rule it out.

319
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,840
If you smoke a fatty one day and you're
sitting in a Jacuzzi and he goes,

320
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,263
it's the character.

321
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,670
I'd like to get to see the character.

322
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,280
You can do that in cartoon form.

323
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,780
I would love to live forever.

324
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,520
That's true.

325
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,100
It's easier,

326
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,070
but I would love to see it
from the place where you're at.

327
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:55,711
You know?

328
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,100
I would love

329
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,933
to see you.

330
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,580
I don't eat none of it.

331
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,071
That's the,

332
00:08:59,071 --> 00:08:59,521
I don't know.

333
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:00,630
That might be the danger.

334
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:01,400
Like Jane Silent.

335
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,060
Bob were not written by a stoner,

336
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:06,180
and at least that's what I learned
to ask you about at that point.

337
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:06,331
You know,

338
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:08,490
maybe they don't work if
they're written by a stoner.

339
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,350
I interrupted you earlier
when you were talking about,

340
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,640
we were talking about the,

341
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:11,851
you know,

342
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:12,990
what's the difference now?

343
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,220
You know,

344
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,460
and that three years later,

345
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,540
like now you're,

346
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,790
you've been smoking weed for how long now?

347
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,260
I started 30 38 1938 no,

348
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,020
no.

349
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,180
Page 38 so that was,

350
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:24,571
I'm sorry,

351
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:27,410
1998 yeah,

352
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,120
nine he started in 98 that's when
you really started smoking weed.

353
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:30,450
No,

354
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:30,930
I'm sorry,

355
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,120
2008 I have 2008 years off.

356
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:33,300
Yeah.

357
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,450
I was baffled because I thought I'd
heard that Seth Rogan got you into it.

358
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:36,980
That was a,

359
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,580
I was doing the math in my head going,

360
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:39,060
wait a second,

361
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,750
I leave off.

362
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,291
Hire you.

363
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,490
You left off very at all.

364
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:42,211
God Damn Day.

365
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:43,170
I'm bad at math,

366
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:44,004
but B,

367
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,530
I skipped a decade in
my head all the time.

368
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,281
All the time.

369
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:47,371
You,

370
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:47,971
Oh God,

371
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:49,320
I forget to do that on checks.

372
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,250
No,

373
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,030
just when the conversation always in
talking about something where I'm like,

374
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,241
oh,

375
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:55,770
but that was like 90 something.

376
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:56,371
They're like Kevin.

377
00:09:56,371 --> 00:10:00,240
Then we had a whole decade and now
we're into a new decade cause you start,

378
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:03,480
once you start getting to the bubbly
start making entertainment there,

379
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,940
there is no more calendar
for either schedules,

380
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,541
you know,

381
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:06,931
shooting,

382
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:07,440
scheduled,

383
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,400
but ain't no more calendar.

384
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:11,820
You don't look at the calendar the way
everybody else does and the idea of 2000

385
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:14,800
still hard to sink in and then 2011 what?

386
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,600
Really?

387
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,370
2000 seems like we're
living in the future.

388
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:18,630
You remember that ACDC Song?

389
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:18,901
No,

390
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:19,081
no.

391
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:19,914
Ace freely song,

392
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,960
don't you know,

393
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,830
my two Railey's comment,

394
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,250
ace freely,

395
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,420
uh,

396
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,690
was I think it was on his solo,

397
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,290
uh,

398
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,810
when he was a with kiss and
they all branched off into Solo.

399
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,200
Right.

400
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,720
But talk at singing about
some guy in the future.

401
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,670
He was singing about a 2000 man guy
flying around jet cars and shit.

402
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:38,504
You know,

403
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,301
I remember being,

404
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:43,920
I was born in 70 and so it was very
easy to do the math because you know,

405
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:45,510
every 10 years you were,

406
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,890
whatever the decade was,

407
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:50,400
you were kind of giving kind of be
that age or at least have the number

408
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,120
involved.

409
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,290
So I would always say like
I'm in in the year 2000,

410
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,340
I'll be 30.

411
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,320
Cause I could do that for simple math.

412
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,110
And that seemed like such
a far way fucking concept.

413
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:02,790
And now we're 11 years past it.

414
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,173
Yeah.

415
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,920
Like the oldest I thought I
could ever imagined I could be.

416
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,590
I tell people I'm 44
and then I have to go,

417
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,483
Ooh,

418
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,773
that's not good.

419
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,220
It doesn't matter anymore.

420
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,230
How much longer is this going to last?

421
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,491
Yeah.

422
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:19,050
Well when it does matter manage,

423
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,560
you know,

424
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,410
pain or no,

425
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,510
he's still in very good shape and I
take care of my Iranian or work out,

426
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:25,201
but I have to,

427
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:26,220
if I don't take care of it,

428
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,480
it drops off quick.

429
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:28,830
Now that's what I'm noticing.

430
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,160
If I get injured and I can't work
out for a couple of weeks now,

431
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,760
whoa.

432
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,910
When I come back it's like I'm
fucking starting from scratch man.

433
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:36,391
I come back,

434
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,680
I'm a pussy like,

435
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,371
like really?

436
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:39,091
Just two weeks,

437
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,950
two weeks I lose like half of my cardio.

438
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:41,910
It's crazy.

439
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,390
Two weeks you get exhausted like really
quickly and it's like you have to build

440
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:50,391
your body back to some sort of artificial
level of functionality in order to do

441
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:53,010
like martial arts and things at my age.

442
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,883
And if you don't,

443
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,360
it's not going to work anymore.

444
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,090
You Shit starting to
break son a year a year,

445
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:01,840
your artificial
functionality must look like,

446
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,280
I must look like the bionic
man compared to my best,

447
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,170
absolute best,

448
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,310
the focus thing.

449
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,560
I just been doing it since I was like,

450
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,150
I started doing martial arts
when I was a real little kid.

451
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:18,130
So by the time I was 15 years old
when I really got really got obsessed,

452
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:18,490
I was,

453
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,850
I was in the sophomore year of high
school and that's when I really,

454
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:23,530
really truly got obsessed
with martial arts.

455
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:24,460
From that time.

456
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:25,990
I've always been training.

457
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,790
That's a long time.

458
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,751
Think about it.

459
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:29,130
Yeah,

460
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,430
it's for me it's like,

461
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:30,701
you know,

462
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:32,380
some people go and they play basketball.

463
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,910
Some people go and you know,

464
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:34,181
they'll,

465
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:36,550
they'll the meet some friends and
they'll go play golf together.

466
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,900
I go and do Jujitsu.

467
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,981
To me it's an,

468
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:39,850
it's a normal thing.

469
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,900
It's like it's,

470
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,560
you know,

471
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,480
going to and training in martial arts,

472
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,314
it's like,

473
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,771
you know,

474
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:47,350
it's how I get my aggressions out.

475
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,060
It's how I straightened my mind out.

476
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:49,960
At the end of the day.

477
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,621
It's how,

478
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:51,630
when you know,

479
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,910
when you're in the face of something very
difficult like sparring with someone,

480
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,110
when you're doing Jiu Jitsu sparring,

481
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,100
you're forced into this
sort of a moving meditation,

482
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,300
sort of a,

483
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,134
a zone.

484
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,900
You know,

485
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,140
where you can only think
about what you're doing.

486
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:09,490
You have to figure out a way to manage
your resources because you're in a hand

487
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:12,160
to hand combat battle with a skilled man,

488
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,351
right?

489
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:14,920
And you guys are going back and forth
to each other and you try to choke each

490
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:16,510
other and it's very intense.

491
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,490
But in doing that very intense thing,

492
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,750
you lose yourself in the movements and
you hit this sort of a zen state and you

493
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:25,030
can only hold it for like a certain
amount of time for you get fucking

494
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:25,864
exhausted.

495
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,200
And the key,

496
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,280
the key is holding that moment
for as long as possible.

497
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,810
Keeping it going for as long as possible.

498
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,830
So you gotta do like strength
and conditioning and Chin
ups and dips and fucking

499
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:39,910
kettlebells and all this shit is just
to get in there so you can go deeper and

500
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:42,050
deeper with the Jujitsu
so he can tap people.

501
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,240
When you were in tapping him,

502
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,400
avoid being tapped when
you were getting tapped.

503
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:45,911
So you,

504
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:46,900
you have to tune you.

505
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:50,710
It's almost like your effort and your
will is what powers your race car.

506
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,000
Instead of just being able to,

507
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,360
you know,

508
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,520
go to the track and get a new
engine or whatever the fuck you do.

509
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:58,150
You know your effort and your will
determine what your physical body can do.

510
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,860
So it's this crazy game that you get
stuck and get addicted to and this game is

511
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,110
just seniors and you're fucking love it.

512
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,370
I love learning new shit,

513
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:07,000
man.

514
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,570
I love working with different kickboxing
trainers and learn a new shed because

515
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,110
when you,

516
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,460
when you learn anything,

517
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:14,290
I believe it elevates everything.

518
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,520
I really believe that.

519
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:20,050
I believe that the more excellence you
can get in your body and your mind in

520
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:20,860
your day,

521
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,180
the better everything is.

522
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,980
I think that the better you'll feel,

523
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:25,090
the better you'll be.

524
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:25,780
You know,

525
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,800
you'll,

526
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,690
you'll project better energy out there.

527
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:29,890
You'll be nicer to people,

528
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:30,701
they'll be nice with you.

529
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:31,720
I really believe that.

530
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,910
I think in getting great at something,

531
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:34,744
in finding,

532
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,840
even if just attempting
to improve at something,

533
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,080
you're always going towards
the right direction.

534
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,240
You're always using positive energy.

535
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:44,590
You are always using discipline.

536
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:47,410
You always getting results
in improving anything.

537
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:50,440
When you see those results
that reinforces this,

538
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:52,320
this in in you,

539
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:56,990
you and your whole existence to push
forward and be positive and create and,

540
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,740
and resolve things and figure
things out and reach your pinnacle.

541
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:01,431
You know?

542
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:04,040
So I think all that stuff like
that's why I got this tattoo.

543
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,070
I think it's all connected.

544
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:05,391
What is it?

545
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:07,370
The book of the Seven
Ring Book of five rings.

546
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:07,800
Fiber,

547
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,980
the Moto moto-massage
you fucking rings in the,

548
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:10,131
yeah.

549
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:12,800
Maybe you're the fucking next
guy going to contribute to it.

550
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,810
What is the subway way?

551
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,080
What are the explaining the title?

552
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:15,914
The five ranks?

553
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:16,520
No,

554
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:16,911
I don't know.

555
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:19,260
You'd have to like
really get into her nod.

556
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:19,911
I don't,

557
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:20,744
I don't know what he's,

558
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,860
this dude was a Ronin.

559
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,341
Yeah,

560
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:22,991
he was around how to,

561
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:27,991
a story on what happened and African
banks bitches and writes poetry for real.

562
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,560
It just got tired of Chubb and
be Blob and he wrote a book.

563
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,161
That was it.

564
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:31,911
He was just like,

565
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:32,181
you know,

566
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:32,931
I killed a lot.

567
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:33,590
Now I'm just going to,

568
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,800
yeah.

569
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,220
I wrote a book on how to be a carpenter
and how to be a fucking philosopher and

570
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:39,080
had to be in anything
really follow that book.

571
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,270
It's an amazing book
if you can figure out,

572
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,830
you see,

573
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,410
it's so hard when you translate from
Japanese to American to really know his

574
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:45,831
words.

575
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:48,980
You would really have to learn Japanese
and understand the difference in the,

576
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:49,461
you know,

577
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:51,320
the way things are worded.

578
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:52,630
You know when you translate you,

579
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,010
you get a rough estimate
of what the guy was saying.

580
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:58,310
It would have to be in the context of his
culture and you take it in the context

581
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:02,360
of the context of the time that he existed
and it's an amazing insight into an

582
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,500
exceptional individual.

583
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:08,501
It's an amazing insight into like a guy
who had reached a height clearly that no

584
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,570
one around him had with
this sword fighting thing,

585
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,890
which is so intense and that you,

586
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,241
you,

587
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:15,500
there's no room for
bullshit and sword fighting.

588
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,570
You can't pretend you're
better than you are.

589
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,830
There's no bullshitting.

590
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,120
There's no need to talk shit.

591
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,983
Okay,

592
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,030
this is all going down with steel.

593
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:26,030
That's going to be moving at like 50
miles an hour towards your fucking face.

594
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:26,620
Yeah.

595
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,410
You got to be absolutely 100%
sure of the correct technique.

596
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:30,861
How to do,

597
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:34,000
how to avoid and get in there and
get your shit done and survive.

598
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,420
This is not tennis bitch.

599
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,530
That's insane.

600
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,850
To live a life like that,

601
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,180
finding people with fucking swords
until we've done it successfully.

602
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,870
I think it was 62 times it was the number
that he supposedly killed and then be

603
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:45,051
like,

604
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:46,490
it's time to become a writer.

605
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,650
Could you imagine somebody put publishes
that book and somebody gives them a bad

606
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:52,130
review?

607
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,980
It's just like there's occasionally,

608
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,450
there's a guy like that that
will exist in martial arts.

609
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:01,340
There's these occasional guys that will
stand out above and beyond all the rest.

610
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,230
Hixon Gracie is the last one.

611
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,770
He's the the the premier
member of the Gracie family.

612
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:07,461
You know the Gracies.

613
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,620
You ever heard of them for the
ultimate fighting championship?

614
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:10,970
Now you're completely out of the loop.

615
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,750
That's awesome.

616
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,951
Yeah.

617
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:12,161
I'm,

618
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:12,440
I'm,

619
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,790
I'm bear on virgin month.

620
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,540
Wow.

621
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,950
I knew there was people
like you out there.

622
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,230
I knew.

623
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:17,911
I'd heard it up,

624
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,331
but that's,

625
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:21,230
that's not even just for
UFC or mixed martial arts.

626
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,870
Any spots,

627
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,180
any sports beyond hockey,

628
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,141
hockey do,

629
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:26,210
but everything else like you know,

630
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:26,871
they'll be like,

631
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:27,021
oh,

632
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:27,451
this guy,

633
00:17:27,451 --> 00:17:27,590
they,

634
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:31,070
and they'll say a name and it's a name
that I've heard for fucking years,

635
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:33,050
but I don't know what sport the Duplos.

636
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,011
What made you,

637
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,090
what made you be this?

638
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:35,970
Um,

639
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:36,830
what did that way?

640
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,693
Yeah.

641
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,973
What made you be

642
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:40,830
broken?

643
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,260
All your,

644
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,550
look,

645
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,410
I'm the worst.

646
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,273
Here's mine.

647
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,920
Professional Pool and fighting.

648
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:46,690
That's it.

649
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,390
That's all I watched.

650
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:47,871
That's awesome.

651
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:48,680
I don't know anything else.

652
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,220
If you are a guy in another sport,

653
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:54,200
either you have to talk a lot of shit
like that Oto Cinco guy or you have what

654
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:54,321
is,

655
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:55,410
get arrested for something.

656
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,273
What does he play?

657
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,180
He's a football player.

658
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,630
Okay.

659
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,720
I was going to guess base and then Michael
Vick gets arrested for killing dogs,

660
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:01,554
so I know who he,

661
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:01,921
yeah,

662
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:02,754
totally.

663
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,830
Definitely the infamous Oj Simpson.

664
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:05,221
I've heard this.

665
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:05,940
I heard of that guy.

666
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,320
Yeah.

667
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,750
This,

668
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,480
like if they're,

669
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,200
you're not a boxer or a kickboxer,

670
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,660
but I know some obscure little
Japanese guys at fight and some,

671
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:13,021
you know,

672
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:14,880
weird circuit over in Japan.

673
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:15,201
I know,

674
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:17,580
I know I've done the name of
a lot of different fighters.

675
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,200
I've caught a lot of that
information in my head.

676
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:20,790
But no sports guys

677
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,661
never had that.

678
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:22,890
Never been a sports dude,

679
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:23,380
wasn't it?

680
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,820
But you are because you're your hockey.

681
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:26,350
Like I could say I'm
not a sports do either,

682
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:28,150
but I obviously am cause
I'm into mixed martial arts.

683
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,880
I'm more about the philosophy
of hockey than anything else.

684
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:32,880
What does this mean for
as a more as an idea,

685
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,680
as an idea I the philosophy of hockey,

686
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,540
I mean as it's kind of
the philosophy of life.

687
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,111
You have a goal.

688
00:18:38,111 --> 00:18:39,100
Someone's in your way,

689
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,240
don't let them stop you.

690
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,373
Score.

691
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,870
Like that's just the very base clear.

692
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,570
I don't think it needs to go much deeper.

693
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:48,340
I think that's kind of the
beauty of the poetry of it.

694
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:52,120
Now you tie that to one
of the most graceful,

695
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:56,410
beautiful games on the planet and
played with physical excellence.

696
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:56,651
I mean,

697
00:18:56,651 --> 00:18:57,401
I understand it.

698
00:18:57,401 --> 00:19:01,000
You need to be on your fucking game to
step into a ring with a dude who could

699
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:02,140
fucking kill you with his fist.

700
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,540
But when you dial it
down to a game that's,

701
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:04,811
you know,

702
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:09,811
less lethal and stuff and more just
about moving a ball or a puck around that

703
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:14,770
sport takes is probably the greatest
athleticism I think to play any sport.

704
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,580
Because think about it
just to stand in skates,

705
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,930
you're using more muscles than most
people actually use on a regular basis.

706
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,170
So even if you're not
doing anything in the game,

707
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,240
you are ready.

708
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,040
You have to be athletically
inclined just to stand there.

709
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,450
Now add to it,

710
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,770
they play tops.

711
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:33,880
What two minutes shifts?

712
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,220
Usually some one minute
shifts to hardcore.

713
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,200
Think about how hard you have to
skate in order to go back and forth.

714
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:44,080
Think about the running that you'll do
on a football field or basketball court.

715
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:44,321
Rather.

716
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:45,640
Let's go with the basketball court.

717
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,361
Um,

718
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:47,500
you know its foot on trial.

719
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:48,340
You're used to running.

720
00:19:48,341 --> 00:19:50,020
Now try that with skates now.

721
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,850
Stop now go back quick now wait,

722
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:52,880
go back the other way.

723
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,310
You're puck chasing the whole time.

724
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,930
Like that's why they have those quick
shifts because who could stand that?

725
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,670
You have to be so physically in shape
to do that and it's beautiful to watch

726
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,050
people do that beautiful
graceful look like shit.

727
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,530
You know they're skating across the
giant diamond or some such shit,

728
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:11,771
you know?

729
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:12,610
And they're on water.

730
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,450
There's this miracle,

731
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:14,500
this element of like,

732
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,480
what do you mean it's water?

733
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,530
Like it's water,

734
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:18,610
but it's hard water.

735
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:18,891
You know?

736
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:21,160
It's just everything about
it really speaks to me.

737
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:21,460
It's fine.

738
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,980
Damn you making me a hockey fan.

739
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,430
I'm ready to go watch some fucking hockey.

740
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,400
It's humble too.

741
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:26,061
You know what I'm saying?

742
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:27,250
Like hi hockey played.

743
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,240
Most athletes are very fucking like,

744
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:32,930
you know a big shades on and they don't
want to talk to cameras and stuff.

745
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,430
Lotta a Lotta,

746
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,200
a lot of dramatics and whatnot.

747
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,240
Hockey players aren't like that at all.

748
00:20:38,241 --> 00:20:38,931
Hockey players,

749
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:39,201
man,

750
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:41,660
you never have to hunt a
hockey player down for a quote.

751
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,501
I think when you're,

752
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:46,790
I think most journalists will tell you
that like their whole philosophy is very,

753
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,380
it's not like any philosophy here in
regards to baseball or football or any

754
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:53,680
other sport.

755
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,630
Philosophy is as simple sell the game.

756
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,501
That's it.

757
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,334
Sell the game.

758
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,501
The,

759
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:57,670
Oh,

760
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,250
the idea of passing the game onto what?

761
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:01,450
I just did a few seconds go.

762
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:02,620
I sold the game so much.

763
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:03,454
So they were like,

764
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:03,701
yeah,

765
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:04,301
I want to see that.

766
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:04,871
That sounds good.

767
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:06,910
Somebody should take a clip
and somebody will take,

768
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,810
take a clip of this and put it on the
Internet and use it as a promo for hockey.

769
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,900
It should know.

770
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,170
No,

771
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,670
she got way more famous before
and it'll pay attention.

772
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,900
You have to be way more famous.

773
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,130
Thanks.

774
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:17,891
So before people,

775
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:18,611
that's hilarious.

776
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,361
How famous do you think?

777
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,680
You are not aware.

778
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,430
Oh,

779
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,090
are you crazy?

780
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:22,421
Listen,

781
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:23,560
you're famous as fuck dude.

782
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,470
Now yes.

783
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,110
Now listen.

784
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,680
I know it's uncomfortable and you want
to be all underground and shit though.

785
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,270
You have a is Ben Affleck.

786
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:34,300
I have stood besides Ben Affleck
and that's fucking famous.

787
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:35,230
That's crazy money.

788
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:35,951
That's ridiculous.

789
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:37,450
Superstardom you're not that.

790
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,680
But you're famous as fuck.

791
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,761
It's a difference.

792
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:40,331
You're famous is,

793
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:41,650
fuck everyone I know knows who you are.

794
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,610
That's ridiculous.

795
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,500
You can't be so rarely is.

796
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,171
It would be silly.

797
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:45,020
I know you want to be humble,

798
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:45,760
but you're being silly.

799
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,690
You're famous as fuck.

800
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,021
I don't know.

801
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:48,370
I think most people like go,

802
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:49,090
oh,

803
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,871
he looks familiar,

804
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:51,940
but I don't think people
know they know your name.

805
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,691
Then you're famous is,

806
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:52,931
fuck.

807
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:53,890
I don't think anybody knows.

808
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:55,070
I think our name is so crazy.

809
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:55,960
Forget your cute.

810
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,650
That's cute.

811
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,371
Now come on,

812
00:21:57,371 --> 00:21:57,581
dude.

813
00:21:57,581 --> 00:21:58,790
It's not a recognized body.

814
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,643
Your mind.

815
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,570
My mom knows who you are.

816
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,010
So many people in this life go,

817
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:03,191
oh,

818
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:03,610
I love,

819
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,350
I love you on fucking King of Queens,

820
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:06,220
Kevin James.

821
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,580
You know what I'm saying to me,

822
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:08,800
so that's retards.

823
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,690
You're going to get retarded.

824
00:22:09,691 --> 00:22:10,600
No matter where you go.

825
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,680
They're an unavoidable,

826
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,570
can't factor them into the equation.

827
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:15,160
You get hit by a random asteroid.

828
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:15,671
That's what that is.

829
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:16,461
When someone comes up to you,

830
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,051
cause you Kevin,

831
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:17,884
James,

832
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,330
rare medieval happened not too many
occasions for me to feel comfortable.

833
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:22,660
You know,

834
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,950
I fuck up with people's names too.

835
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:26,070
I'm always confusing one
person with another person.

836
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,261
I'm like,

837
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,550
Oh yeah,

838
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,360
really shit,

839
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:28,660
you know,

840
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,020
but that's,

841
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,360
I'm literally still dying
inside because I was thinking,

842
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,021
oh my God,

843
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:33,820
it was our wardrobe person's name,

844
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:36,670
Beth and I almost said Beth
Pasternak and I'm like,

845
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:37,510
is that her name?

846
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,560
And because that's one,

847
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,000
remember your login you to stone.

848
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,320
I wouldn't call it two stone,

849
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:42,550
but I a stoned enough.

850
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:42,761
Yeah,

851
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:43,540
you give,

852
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,340
if you're going to commit to a lifestyle,

853
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:45,580
you,

854
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,210
you give up on short term a
lot where you're just like,

855
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,470
I'm going to need help.

856
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,550
Like I do that a lot.

857
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:52,630
I find you've are fine.

858
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,640
I don't know how if you
ever do this on stage,

859
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:59,641
but I tell such long fucking convoluted
stories that invariably wants twice per

860
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:01,121
night.

861
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:04,060
Now I'll be in the middle of
something and just be like,

862
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,600
um,

863
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,310
like I,

864
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,101
I don't freeze it.

865
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:07,420
Don't get scared anymore,

866
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,950
but I just literally go,

867
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,390
the fuck was I talking about?

868
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:11,224
I'm so sorry.

869
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,460
And someone will be like,

870
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:12,941
ah,

871
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:14,790
it was Jerry Muse in a bathtub.

872
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,010
I'm like,

873
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:15,341
Oh yes,

874
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:16,121
thank you anyway.

875
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:19,330
And boom right back in as long as they
can help you out as long as they're there

876
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:19,690
to help.

877
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,231
But if not,

878
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:21,790
do there moments where you're just like,

879
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,301
oh my God.

880
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,870
Like I was on the tonight show earlier
and I sat down to tape the tonight show

881
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,900
and I wasn't nearly
stoned enough for that.

882
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,680
I wish I'd been more stone cause I would
have enjoyed it more the whole time I'm

883
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:35,170
sitting there just thinking
like I look fat on the show.

884
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:36,670
I know I look fat right now.

885
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:37,504
I know look fat.

886
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,800
And in the midst of it,

887
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:40,990
I did have those moments
where I wasn't stone,

888
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:42,040
but at a moment where I was like,

889
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,840
what the hell was I talking tonight?

890
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,280
Show you have one of those moments.

891
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,940
Yeah.

892
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,010
Luckily I connected it quickly,

893
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,590
but I love doing it onstage.

894
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,441
I used to be like,

895
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:51,621
oh,

896
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:53,090
you can't let people know.

897
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:53,571
And I'm like,

898
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:53,691
yeah,

899
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:55,040
and let's be realistic.

900
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,520
Like,

901
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:55,791
Hey,

902
00:23:55,791 --> 00:24:00,791
I'm 41 I'm in the middle of a fucking
labyrinthine story to begin with.

903
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:03,740
There's so many moving parts and B,

904
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:05,870
it's see you throw some
weed on top of that.

905
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,231
You know,

906
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:09,770
every once in a while maybe a gear is
going to slip and you're going to forget a

907
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:10,221
detail,

908
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:12,230
but as long as the audience
is there to rescue you,

909
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:12,860
it's all good.

910
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,510
I love the fact that
you're honest about it.

911
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:14,751
You know,

912
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:17,600
there's a lot of people that aren't honest
about the positive effects of it and

913
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:19,220
they treat it like it's a trivial thing.

914
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:19,850
Oh,

915
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,181
you know,

916
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:20,570
when I,

917
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,140
when I was,

918
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,870
one of the things that I was
upset with Dr drew about,

919
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,151
and I,

920
00:24:24,151 --> 00:24:25,610
and I do really love Dr drew,

921
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:26,570
but he's like,

922
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:26,751
oh,

923
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:27,920
you want to go smoke your weed?

924
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,550
Smoking weed?

925
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:28,791
You know,

926
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:29,280
like you say,

927
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,541
look,

928
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,680
I'm not telling you not to do it,

929
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,210
but it's dismissive about
it being a positive thing.

930
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,081
It's always like,

931
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:36,301
yeah,

932
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:38,150
you want to go do whatever
you want to do with your life.

933
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:39,200
I'm for freewill.

934
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:40,490
I'm for you having a good time.

935
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:42,680
And if you want to ruin your thing and go,

936
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:43,580
go right ahead.

937
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:44,414
I'm for,

938
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,580
but that's not your,

939
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:49,250
you're not taking to account all the
people that talk about these amazingly

940
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:52,100
positive benefits of the half
from it and you're one of them.

941
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:52,430
You know,

942
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,920
you're always talking
about mine medicine man.

943
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:57,020
I it and some people be like,

944
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:57,361
oh,

945
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:58,191
it just what it is.

946
00:24:58,191 --> 00:25:00,350
It fuel your creativity as a no,

947
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:01,310
quite the opposite.

948
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:05,420
Like I don't think I've ever gotten a
new idea from weed that I wouldn't have

949
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,350
had otherwise.

950
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,890
What we'd allows you to
do is chase the good idea,

951
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,680
uh,

952
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,410
and embrace it rather than let it go for
fear that someone will judge it or for

953
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:17,300
fear that it won't work or hey,

954
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:18,590
this hasn't been done yet.

955
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,760
So I find weed doesn't make me
creative as much as it knocks down the

956
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:25,220
inhibitions that block creativity.

957
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,300
Like the reason you don't go further
on that cool idea because you're afraid

958
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:33,680
it's going to be judged or won't turn out
or who will ever buy this or what am I

959
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:34,131
thinking?

960
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:36,440
Or I can't pull something
like this off weed.

961
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:37,370
You could smoke away.

962
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:42,080
Those inhibitions is a very important
man that no matter how long we're here to

963
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:43,190
push down all those,

964
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:45,290
even the dopiest fucking fears,

965
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,340
the things that you're like,

966
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,260
anything in the boxes you in,

967
00:25:48,261 --> 00:25:49,100
like you're talking about.

968
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:52,490
People like to sometimes keep that
box tighter and tighter to your eyes,

969
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,540
but it's more important to
kind of understand why things
happen and who invented

970
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:56,840
it,

971
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,770
what makes it work,

972
00:25:57,771 --> 00:25:58,604
so to speak,

973
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,720
get to the bottom of it.

974
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:01,190
And weed makes you more introspective.

975
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:01,941
It really does.

976
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:04,340
You start looking and you start thinking,

977
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,630
you start to elders.

978
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,150
It creates time for me and
it creates time to think.

979
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,100
We have cannabinoid
receptors in our brain.

980
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:10,281
Oh,

981
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:11,060
I love the scope.

982
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,920
Go Yoda stoned to THC.

983
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:13,491
You know,

984
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:17,030
we know that human use of THC
goes back at least 10,000 years.

985
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:17,261
We,

986
00:26:17,261 --> 00:26:17,451
we,

987
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:17,691
you know,

988
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:18,051
we've,

989
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:21,710
we're constantly finding like old
mummies with bags of weed with them.

990
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,070
You know,

991
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,311
there's,

992
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:26,120
there's people that believe that it had
some part of the evolution of language,

993
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,691
you know,

994
00:26:26,691 --> 00:26:29,480
and explain the idea of
this cannabinoids receptors.

995
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:29,690
All right.

996
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,800
The idea that you've got receptors in
your brain tuned in to give you eggs to

997
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,740
tune into exactly what this
marijuana plant is getting.

998
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:38,330
Only that they do nothing else,

999
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:40,070
but that was the also they also,

1000
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:44,310
I think cannabinoids can be fired
up when you that runner's high too.

1001
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,151
I think somehow.

1002
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:46,670
I know that that's very soon.

1003
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,230
You are the one telling me this far.

1004
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,650
I think it was when you were on the show,

1005
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:53,520
you were going and telling me like the
the drug or the brain kicks in with

1006
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:55,110
something when you're about to die.

1007
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:55,651
They said,

1008
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:55,741
well,

1009
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:56,511
they believe it.

1010
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:57,810
It's called dimethyltryptamine.

1011
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,580
It's produced by the liver,

1012
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:00,151
the lungs,

1013
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,160
and they believe it's
produced by the pineal gland.

1014
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:06,390
They're actually doing these spa like
super specific studies on this shit right

1015
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:11,100
now because throughout all eastern
mysticism they've always talked about the

1016
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:13,410
third on that image.

1017
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:13,541
Right?

1018
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:13,950
Of course.

1019
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,940
Well that is where the pineal gland rests
and it literally is an eyeball on that

1020
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:20,400
from that HP Lovecraft movie from beyond,

1021
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,110
they were going after the pineal glands.

1022
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:23,190
A little fucking thing came out.

1023
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:23,411
Well,

1024
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:27,390
the crazy thing about that gland is that
in certain reptiles and actually has a

1025
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:30,840
retina in a lens like
it's a fucking eyeball,

1026
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:31,110
it is.

1027
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,920
It is an eyeball and in they believe
that this is what they call it,

1028
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:36,030
the seat of the soul.

1029
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:39,690
They believe it is the
factory of the most potent,

1030
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,360
naturally produced psychedelic chemicals.

1031
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,560
We don't know what exactly because you
have to cut into the fucking brain like

1032
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:49,290
within 15 minutes of someone
being dead to find it.

1033
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,250
I think there's some,

1034
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:55,251
some crazy roadblock to finding out
exactly what today's technology,

1035
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,320
where the the DMT is being
manufactured in the brain,

1036
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,670
so they're trying to figure out an invent
new technology to directly monitor it

1037
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:05,490
so they can absolutely prove
it even if they don't prove it.

1038
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,260
Where,

1039
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,200
where it's manufactured.

1040
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:08,820
It's known that it exists in the body.

1041
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,970
It's known that it's produced by several
different organs and it is known that

1042
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:13,440
it's intensely psychedelic.

1043
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:18,630
W what I found comforting about that
was the way you presented it was in the

1044
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:21,240
moment that you are dying,

1045
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,050
your body knows that
and sends it in doses.

1046
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:26,300
Huge.

1047
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,930
Just send me an angel.

1048
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:28,660
Yes,

1049
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,190
bitch.

1050
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,200
It just dopes you and
the fuck out the edge.

1051
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,740
That notion that my body is like mad.

1052
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,723
Nah,

1053
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,110
he ain't going to handle
this Chubby can't handle it.

1054
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,600
He's going to need to shut down.

1055
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,650
Boom,

1056
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,161
boom,

1057
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:41,880
boom.

1058
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,780
And then the doors of perception
open up like fucking giant exploding

1059
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:50,781
kaleidoscopes of insane light with no
boundary and you get shot through a

1060
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:51,541
fucking tunnel.

1061
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:52,770
Just like a DMT trip.

1062
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,010
Don't give transported into
the center of the universe.

1063
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,750
How many psychedelic
experiences have you had?

1064
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,360
Never.

1065
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,041
I mean what?

1066
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:02,311
What?

1067
00:29:02,311 --> 00:29:03,840
Explain mushrooms.

1068
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,171
No,

1069
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:04,830
don't do that.

1070
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,663
I've never done that.

1071
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,061
But you're like,

1072
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:06,630
wait.

1073
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:06,771
Yeah,

1074
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:07,200
I do.

1075
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,430
And I'm not even judgemental about it.

1076
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:09,690
Like I can't say that people that do,

1077
00:29:09,691 --> 00:29:10,740
but I've never done it.

1078
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:11,640
I don't know if it would,

1079
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,110
I don't know how I would handle that.

1080
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:13,560
Oh,

1081
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,390
you have much to learn.

1082
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,223
Grasshopper.

1083
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,820
We were ready to straighten you out.

1084
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,910
I don't know if that's
Mckenna building goes,

1085
00:29:20,911 --> 00:29:24,790
but like the floor I'm on is
frightening enough but manageable.

1086
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,970
I can't imagine what it's like.

1087
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:27,301
Well,

1088
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:28,650
98 three years.

1089
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:30,840
You're just sort of coming to
grips with the whole thing.

1090
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,280
You know that your,

1091
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,060
your whole life is greatly enhance and
far more fascinating when you're high.

1092
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,860
And then you start thinking about,

1093
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:37,951
well,

1094
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:41,230
why aren't more people talking about
the benefits of this incredible drug and

1095
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:42,460
why is it being demonized?

1096
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,230
And you start processing in your mind.

1097
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:49,231
And Mushrooms are that times a million
and den Dmt is mushrooms times a million

1098
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,510
plus aliens.

1099
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,790
So that's what it is.

1100
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,241
It's like,

1101
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:56,480
does anyone come back?

1102
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:56,751
Yeah,

1103
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:56,951
man,

1104
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:57,050
I'm,

1105
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,480
maybe you gotta be a weak bitch,

1106
00:29:58,481 --> 00:29:59,370
but you might get lost.

1107
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,740
I'm not scared of the woods,

1108
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:03,130
Bro.

1109
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,000
I go out in the woods,

1110
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,740
I'll go out in the woods to
learn something about myself.

1111
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:06,491
And that's what it is.

1112
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:08,500
It's like every,

1113
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:12,340
every intense psychedelic experience is
like what year the benefits that you're

1114
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:13,180
getting from,

1115
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:13,720
um,

1116
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,180
marijuana is like a slow IV drip,

1117
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:16,570
right?

1118
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,220
This is like someone's sticking a fucking
Turkey based or up your asshole and

1119
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,120
shoving it.

1120
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,030
Scary lunging into your
central nervous system.

1121
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,201
Well,

1122
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:28,480
it's supposed to be scary
because as you said,

1123
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:31,450
when you heard that your
father scream to death,

1124
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,520
you only get one shot at this,

1125
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,270
you know,

1126
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:34,811
and that,

1127
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:37,240
that fear is the fear of losing control,

1128
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,160
which is absolutely inevitable.

1129
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:39,861
You know,

1130
00:30:39,861 --> 00:30:40,451
and you know it,

1131
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:41,051
I know it.

1132
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:44,500
And that you did with the
psychedelic experiences or like,

1133
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,080
it's like,

1134
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,390
it allows you to almost go through
a death experience several times.

1135
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,010
Not to the point where you feel dead,

1136
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,600
but to the point where you're,

1137
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,660
your whole view of the
world is so shattered.

1138
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,850
Your ego is so you,

1139
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:58,181
your,

1140
00:30:58,181 --> 00:31:03,181
your actual worth in your actual piece
in this puzzle is made so clear and it's

1141
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:07,840
so humbling and it's so confusing
and it's so enlightening and it's so

1142
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:12,790
encouraging and it's so loving and it's
so frightening all at the same time,

1143
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,880
all impossible to describe the images and
the feeling you get literally probably

1144
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,920
are responsible for human evolution.

1145
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,010
And there's some that game,

1146
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,710
Terence Mckenna believe that the reason,

1147
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:24,520
and he had at this,

1148
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,890
this documented down to climate change.

1149
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,880
He believed that the reason why human
beings evolved from other hominids is that

1150
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:34,540
they started experimenting with new food
sources and eating siliciden mushrooms

1151
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,270
and he has it all down to when the,

1152
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,290
the rain forest receded and became
grasslands cause the climate change.

1153
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,530
That's when the monkeys ran out of
food and they started in grasslands.

1154
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:45,910
It's not as rich as the rain forest.

1155
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:48,940
So they had to fucking experiment new
food sources and that's when all these

1156
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,560
cows were walking around eating the glass.

1157
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,060
The grass cow shit out.

1158
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:54,910
The Shit Shit grows mushrooms
on a monkeys eat the mushrooms,

1159
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:59,170
monkeys figure out all kinds of different
shit like language and coordination

1160
00:31:59,171 --> 00:32:02,890
and how to make tools and how to fucking
throw rocks at things and killed them

1161
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,113
tools.

1162
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,290
We were just on the know
somebody that's a tool.

1163
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:06,711
No,

1164
00:32:06,711 --> 00:32:07,890
but my wife told him this story,

1165
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,760
if I fucking capture my imagination
was just kind of write up the salad.

1166
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:12,950
You see this dolphin story
about the conch shells?

1167
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,670
No.

1168
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,180
Oh,

1169
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,170
they use them to fish?

1170
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,123
Yes.

1171
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:16,491
Yeah,

1172
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:17,360
I did hear about that.

1173
00:32:17,361 --> 00:32:20,510
How fucking spell Vinings that these
dolphins are taking these conch shells,

1174
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:22,880
which that was the second most
surprising thing about the story.

1175
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:23,810
To me there was a picture,

1176
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,681
it's conch shells.

1177
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:27,620
Fucking huge mega conch shells
is like being like this,

1178
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:28,600
but it's funny.

1179
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,710
So that's the thing like Whoa,

1180
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,990
why in any event these dolphins,

1181
00:32:32,991 --> 00:32:37,340
they found them like they thought they
used to go under the conch shells to fish

1182
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:40,220
out anything that wasn't live
in their fish or what have you.

1183
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,550
But they've discovered that
they're using them as tools,

1184
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:44,750
as trapping tools,

1185
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:50,050
like using them to kind of heard fish
and then cup Lum and then eat out of it.

1186
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,600
So using them to capture and to
dig and like not and very specific,

1187
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:56,990
not just like,

1188
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,330
oh he's balancing a conch shell.

1189
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,260
They're using it.

1190
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:00,530
They're,

1191
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,000
they're figuring tools out.

1192
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:02,591
Yeah.

1193
00:33:02,591 --> 00:33:05,050
How to dolphins get so
fucking smart without thumbs.

1194
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,000
It's really interesting
when you think about it,

1195
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:09,790
cause no separators in the ocean
and you don't have to open the door.

1196
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,560
They're supposed to be really intelligent.

1197
00:33:11,561 --> 00:33:11,711
Like,

1198
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:14,380
we don't exactly know how
intelligent and some people,

1199
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,850
because I think their cerebral cortex
is some large percentage larger than a

1200
00:33:18,851 --> 00:33:19,571
human beings,

1201
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:21,730
like something like 40%
larger than a human beings.

1202
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,390
They have.

1203
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:22,991
What would that mean?

1204
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:24,910
I don't know if they've
been on a no reason better.

1205
00:33:24,911 --> 00:33:25,301
I don't know.

1206
00:33:25,301 --> 00:33:25,451
No,

1207
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:26,200
I don't think so.

1208
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,730
I think they just have like
such a different world as
far as their coordination

1209
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:34,030
and their physical movement and a like
neanderthal had a bigger brain than a

1210
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:35,470
human bang and one of the,

1211
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,610
and they were done with us for sure,

1212
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:39,640
but they needed a bigger brain
operate that fucking ridiculous body.

1213
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,740
Like neanderthals were
very different than people.

1214
00:33:41,741 --> 00:33:42,580
There were five foot,

1215
00:33:42,581 --> 00:33:42,851
two,

1216
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:45,340
200 pounds of solid muscle and bone.

1217
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,530
There were these big
like half chimp people,

1218
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,000
you know,

1219
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,890
like if you look at like,

1220
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,190
like drawings of the [inaudible],

1221
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,610
like they don't really resemble,

1222
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,361
I mean they do,

1223
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:57,340
but they don't do legs and
two other standing up right
of they would have fucked

1224
00:33:57,341 --> 00:34:00,880
us up if it was just like one on one
brawls between the underdogs and people.

1225
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:02,950
Most likely neanderthals
would've fucked us up.

1226
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:03,880
Yeah.

1227
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,320
There's some,

1228
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,680
this is some serious genetic,

1229
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,491
what was I talking about?

1230
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:08,230
Why did I talking about man,

1231
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,810
that's what it sounds like.

1232
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:11,201
Yeah.

1233
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:11,980
What was I talking about?

1234
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,100
You're talking about a neanderthal man.

1235
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:18,640
Big Brain needed big brain
to operate that big body.

1236
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:18,911
Oh,

1237
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:19,110
sorry.

1238
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,240
Okay.

1239
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:19,811
It's dolphins.

1240
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:20,591
Brains are larger.

1241
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:23,710
It could be just to operate
that incredible body they have.

1242
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,540
You just hit a pothole and my friend.

1243
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:25,810
Yeah.

1244
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,643
Good.

1245
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,040
Thank you for [inaudible] to save.

1246
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:28,210
Yeah,

1247
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:28,541
thank you.

1248
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,760
And that's what is the beautiful thing
about letting the audience know that

1249
00:34:30,761 --> 00:34:32,110
you're high and when
you do those Q and A's,

1250
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:32,710
do you let them know,

1251
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,130
listen,

1252
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,180
I just need you as a net.

1253
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,840
The nice thing about always talking about
being stone is people that just assume

1254
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:39,220
that at all times you are.

1255
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:41,050
So there's a nice blanket for everything.

1256
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,300
Did you ever get to the point when
you first started getting high?

1257
00:34:43,301 --> 00:34:43,461
We,

1258
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:45,250
you got too high and
he got really paranoid.

1259
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,810
Not Paranoid is quit.

1260
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:47,351
No,

1261
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:47,801
not quit,

1262
00:34:47,801 --> 00:34:50,020
but I thought I'd died when
I thought I was going to die.

1263
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:54,910
I got really stoned with my friend Jim
Jackman and he came over and we were out

1264
00:34:54,911 --> 00:34:57,310
on the deck at my house.

1265
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,570
It's night out,

1266
00:34:58,571 --> 00:35:01,780
stars and shit sitting there smoking and
I had already spoke before he got there

1267
00:35:01,781 --> 00:35:02,620
and then he came and I was like,

1268
00:35:02,621 --> 00:35:02,720
oh,

1269
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,401
spoke another one.

1270
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,800
This is in the days before
I would smoke that much.

1271
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,190
So two joints within
the span of like what?

1272
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:12,940
An hour and a half or something like that
and by the time I got to burn down to

1273
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:14,110
the bottom of the second one,

1274
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,790
I was like really,

1275
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,510
really,

1276
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,080
really,

1277
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,471
really,

1278
00:35:17,471 --> 00:35:18,010
really,

1279
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,060
really fucked up.

1280
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,860
And I kept telling him,

1281
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:21,221
I was like,

1282
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:22,530
I think this is it.

1283
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,260
I got a late,

1284
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,090
I gotta lay down like I,

1285
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,610
I think my heart might stop tonight.

1286
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,091
And he's like,

1287
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:28,880
you want me to do anything?

1288
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,141
I was like,

1289
00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:29,321
no,

1290
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:30,140
let me just lay down.

1291
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,480
I laid down next to the pool,

1292
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:33,790
just on the deck looking up
at the stars and I was like,

1293
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:34,660
I'm too high,

1294
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,220
dangerously high.

1295
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,381
I don't know what was,

1296
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:39,480
I'd never really experienced that again.

1297
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,180
Will that then what do you think it was?

1298
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:41,471
Well,

1299
00:35:41,471 --> 00:35:42,090
first of all,

1300
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,760
you probably wasn't
babbling heart expanding

1301
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,253
the movie.

1302
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,870
Is that what I have?

1303
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,170
My mother never told me he's a silly,

1304
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:53,890
do I get to fuck Murcia till mag as well.

1305
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,400
That was that.

1306
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:55,931
Was that what it was?

1307
00:35:55,931 --> 00:35:56,860
The boy had a bamboo in heart.

1308
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:57,690
He get to,

1309
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,960
he had a bad heart and in his parents
told me that at baboons they told me

1310
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,230
those rookie highs,

1311
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,760
you don't really achieve those,

1312
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,050
those rookie highs.

1313
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,250
Once you get a tolerance,

1314
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:12,400
those rookie highs are like getting
shot into the center of the universe.

1315
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,480
Chris Mcguire and when we got Chris
Mcguire high one night behind the comedy

1316
00:36:16,481 --> 00:36:16,631
store,

1317
00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:17,464
do you remember the story?

1318
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,550
You were there with me.

1319
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,180
We were Chris when Chris is a buddy of
mine from way back who've never gets

1320
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:22,391
high.

1321
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:24,860
He's a comic and it usually
has a couple of beers that's,

1322
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,230
he'll get high if you're forced them too.

1323
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,651
All right,

1324
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:27,484
I'll take a hit of this.

1325
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,780
He was a stone cold rookie
and he took two hits of was.

1326
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:35,500
It was probably trainwreck cause
that's all we ever smoke is ridiculous.

1327
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:37,780
Super space philosopher weed.

1328
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,420
And then I came back to him
like 20 minutes later it goes,

1329
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:40,521
Yo,

1330
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:41,290
I got a problem.

1331
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,370
I've got a real problem here.

1332
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:42,941
He goes,

1333
00:36:42,941 --> 00:36:43,421
this is not,

1334
00:36:43,421 --> 00:36:45,100
we need somebody puts
something in this man.

1335
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:45,430
I,

1336
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:45,580
I'm,

1337
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:45,820
I'm,

1338
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,080
this is somebody puts something in this.

1339
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:47,471
I'm telling you,

1340
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,304
this is not pot.

1341
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,031
I've been hunting before.

1342
00:36:49,031 --> 00:36:49,864
This is not pot.

1343
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,501
This is serious,

1344
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:50,681
man.

1345
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:51,280
I'm serious.

1346
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,270
Somebody puts something in this.

1347
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:52,781
I'm like,

1348
00:36:52,781 --> 00:36:53,291
no dude,

1349
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:53,531
dude,

1350
00:36:53,531 --> 00:36:53,801
dude,

1351
00:36:53,801 --> 00:36:54,160
dude,

1352
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,993
the weeds,

1353
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,773
they'll eat that good.

1354
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,671
And he was like,

1355
00:36:57,671 --> 00:36:58,660
no way.

1356
00:36:58,661 --> 00:36:59,321
That can't be real.

1357
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:00,340
He didn't believe it.

1358
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,980
Didn't believe it
because that rookie high,

1359
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,230
the rookie high is,

1360
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,260
it's terrifying.

1361
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:05,471
I mean,

1362
00:37:05,471 --> 00:37:06,730
you might as well be on ecstasy.

1363
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,440
It might as well be an asset.

1364
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:08,890
I,

1365
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,830
I can't say that I miss it though.

1366
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,360
Like I enjoy,

1367
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:13,981
I never feel,

1368
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,510
I always said I don't get stoned.

1369
00:37:15,511 --> 00:37:16,410
That's for teenagers.

1370
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:17,244
I get centered.

1371
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,470
I enjoy where I get now.

1372
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,671
Great Place,

1373
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,840
great for conversation,

1374
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:22,351
great for,

1375
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:22,980
like I said,

1376
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,230
knocking over d inhibitions and whatnot.

1377
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:25,860
Um,

1378
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,671
I'm not quite,

1379
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:28,470
I don't know if I'm ready
to open the third eye,

1380
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:29,020
but if,

1381
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,030
if anyone's sold me closer to that,

1382
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,310
you don't need to do it.

1383
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,420
Nobody needs to do anything,

1384
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:33,641
man.

1385
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:34,471
That's all nonsense.

1386
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:35,540
You can find your own place.

1387
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,450
They need to give it a shot,

1388
00:37:36,451 --> 00:37:37,950
but it sounds appetizing.

1389
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:38,850
I mean it's like,

1390
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:39,121
look,

1391
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:39,450
I'm a,

1392
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:44,250
I am something of a journey or now and
at the end of the day it's not that far

1393
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:44,611
removed.

1394
00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:45,121
We're not talking.

1395
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:45,521
If he's not that,

1396
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:48,240
you would go on like you should
do some bumps and fucking rails.

1397
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:48,571
Dude,

1398
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:51,450
you're talking about another thing
that's very close to what I'm doing.

1399
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,500
It's very much the same
as as what you're doing.

1400
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:56,400
It's all the same thing.

1401
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:56,581
It's,

1402
00:37:56,581 --> 00:37:58,770
it's forcing you to shake like,

1403
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:01,410
can I make a milk orange juice thing?

1404
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:02,910
Where are you crying to an orange.

1405
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,881
You want to eat it?

1406
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,490
It gets really crazy because
it lasts for like six hours.

1407
00:38:06,491 --> 00:38:08,410
This is like a slow DMT release.

1408
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,810
What do you do with it though?

1409
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:10,050
You get,

1410
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:10,571
if you eat it,

1411
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:12,980
you have to eat it with an Mao inhibitor
and you've got to know something else.

1412
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,290
How to brew that correctly.

1413
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,090
It's like you can't eat it when you,

1414
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:16,211
oh,

1415
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:20,410
when you or at when you take it in oral
ACC DMT exists apparently in so many

1416
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:24,640
different plants that our body has
a builtin defense mechanism for it.

1417
00:38:24,641 --> 00:38:26,380
It's called Mano aiming oxidase.

1418
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,770
So when you eat something like say
if you eat grass that has DMT in it,

1419
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,850
like sheep,

1420
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,860
if they eat that grass will die.

1421
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,270
It's really kind of crazy.

1422
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:34,901
Like sheep.

1423
00:38:34,901 --> 00:38:36,490
If eat grass has DMT in it,

1424
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,880
they just fucking fall in their bag and
stick their legs up and they tremble in

1425
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:40,510
the air.

1426
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,410
It's really kind of Nutty,

1427
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,940
but human beings have figured out a way
to process it in our stomachs and that's

1428
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:47,460
what this motto Amy unoxidized says.

1429
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,990
That's why we can eat it in
so many different plants,

1430
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,520
but yet it's not psychoactive.

1431
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,980
What these guys in the Amazon,

1432
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:57,040
they figured out a way to make
it psychoactive when he eat it.

1433
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:01,510
By combining this plant that as
this one drug with an Mao inhibitor,

1434
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:04,750
so it kills the monoamine oxidase and
your stomach and it allows your stomach to

1435
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:05,950
absorb this drug directly.

1436
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,070
So you have to take something
in order to Hugh can,

1437
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:10,270
you're going to be in the jungle.

1438
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:11,500
There's no refrigerators.

1439
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,423
Dude.

1440
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,200
This is all bad.

1441
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,320
It's a big step.

1442
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,230
It's a big step.

1443
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:15,461
Let's go.

1444
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:17,630
You gotta be a real seeker
if you want to do this.

1445
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,751
Wait,

1446
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:19,310
I thought we got,

1447
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,143
I'm not sure.

1448
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,060
That's the oral DMT mosquito Kosha.

1449
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,200
That's the oral DMT.

1450
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,610
What do you mean all my sermons first?

1451
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:27,340
Don't even go.

1452
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:27,501
Wait,

1453
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:28,980
what is the mind mushroom?

1454
00:39:28,981 --> 00:39:29,850
You Chew Right?

1455
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,181
Yeah.

1456
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:31,190
You just need a little mushrooms.

1457
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,340
You can make your first trip.

1458
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,510
Could I'd make like a
strawberry milkshake mushroom.

1459
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,650
You can eat it with the
same amount of people.

1460
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,570
Like it won't be like,

1461
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,580
oh no it,

1462
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,260
you really shouldn't have
food in your stomach.

1463
00:39:42,261 --> 00:39:44,450
But as long as that is the only food that,

1464
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:46,820
and it'll be like probably
diminish the effects,

1465
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:47,660
vary slightly,

1466
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:49,670
but ultimately it's all going
to get into your bloodstream.

1467
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,640
It's good.

1468
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,680
Did you ever have a bad trip,

1469
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,200
bad trips or uh,

1470
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:53,810
uh,

1471
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,181
they're,

1472
00:39:54,181 --> 00:39:54,880
they're actually,

1473
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,210
uh,

1474
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,900
and it doesn't seem like it at the time,

1475
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,900
but they're actually almost all beneficial
as long as you don't go completely

1476
00:39:59,901 --> 00:40:00,620
crazy.

1477
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,080
What you learned from a bad trip
is that you've got some issues,

1478
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:03,321
man.

1479
00:40:03,321 --> 00:40:04,520
You got some shit that's bugging you.

1480
00:40:04,521 --> 00:40:05,240
You got some,

1481
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,073
some,

1482
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,880
she's got some imbalances in your
mind and you are not focusing on them.

1483
00:40:10,881 --> 00:40:15,140
That's usually what it is and it comes
up or it's facing nightmarish form.

1484
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:17,240
It comes up in nightmarish clarity.

1485
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:20,390
That's what psychedelic experiences really
do it when you have something that's

1486
00:40:20,391 --> 00:40:21,620
really fucking with you,

1487
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,101
that it's,

1488
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:26,720
it's such a primary focus inside your
mind that when you open up these doors to

1489
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:27,890
psychedelic dimensions,

1490
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,330
your mind is going to grab that shit
and shove it in your face and go,

1491
00:40:32,331 --> 00:40:33,950
what the fuck is this?

1492
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,200
Why you hiding this from?

1493
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,800
Why don't you get this
shit out of the way?

1494
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,220
Why do you think Oscar de la Hoya came
clean and said that he was wearing

1495
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:41,420
women's underwear and those photos?

1496
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:42,254
Then it was a real,

1497
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,160
because every night that the fucking
truth is knocking them on the head,

1498
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:46,581
Dude,

1499
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:47,020
you were in

1500
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,351
checks,

1501
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:47,771
underwear.

1502
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:48,730
Just fucking say it.

1503
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,013
I can't,

1504
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,910
he can take care of just
tossing and sweating.

1505
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,250
If he ate a pot Brownie,

1506
00:40:55,251 --> 00:40:57,770
he would have been forced to admit it
like right away he just would have been

1507
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,830
two down strips you down,

1508
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,401
you know,

1509
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:01,571
and you,

1510
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:01,760
you,

1511
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:01,971
you,

1512
00:41:01,971 --> 00:41:03,620
you have a strong mushroom trip,

1513
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:03,761
man.

1514
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:04,910
It just strips you down.

1515
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,180
You see what they describe as
the wiring under the board.

1516
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:08,781
You know,

1517
00:41:08,781 --> 00:41:10,760
you see things in a different perspective.

1518
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,241
It's,

1519
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:11,501
it's,

1520
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:12,950
it's an impossible perspective.

1521
00:41:12,951 --> 00:41:13,850
It shouldn't be.

1522
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:14,721
First of all,

1523
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:16,040
it shouldn't exist and second of all,

1524
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,690
it shouldn't be so easy to get to.

1525
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,400
All you have to do is eat this stuff.

1526
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:22,340
You eat this stuff and wait an hour and
20 minutes and all of a sudden you're

1527
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:26,630
literally in an impossible describe
different world that shouldn't exist.

1528
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:30,320
It can't be real because it violates
everything you know about life.

1529
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,790
When you're closing your eyes,

1530
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:34,910
everywhere you look is
more and more impossible.

1531
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,630
And there's information coming at you
all the answers to all the world's

1532
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:39,410
problems,

1533
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,940
but it's like slippery fish and you're
standing in a river and you can't fucking

1534
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:45,170
hold on to many of it.

1535
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,390
There's just too many
fucking fish coming your way,

1536
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:47,661
man.

1537
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:51,050
And there's the water and the information
is hitting you like the fucking river.

1538
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,850
You're selling the game or some.

1539
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,330
Again,

1540
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,230
it's not for everybody,

1541
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:55,160
but it's for you.

1542
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,230
That's what I say.

1543
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,250
It's not for everybody,

1544
00:41:58,251 --> 00:41:59,030
but it's for you.

1545
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:03,260
There's great men who have
learned incredible things
from psychedelic trips and

1546
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:06,010
there's a guy named Graham Hancock who
was going to be doing the podcast soon.

1547
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,400
He contacted me in email.

1548
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,690
I just emailed him back and he says,

1549
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,600
genius writer who wrote these fascinating
books about ancient human history

1550
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:14,060
called the fingerprints of the gods.

1551
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,140
It's a all about these ancient
structures that point to uh,

1552
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,160
the v very plausible idea that the human
race has been around way longer than

1553
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:24,380
we'd like to thank.

1554
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,150
And that civilization has had peaks and
valleys where we were almost wiped out

1555
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:32,150
and we had to rebuild a new and he claims
that they're kinda like what you were

1556
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:32,901
talking about before,

1557
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:35,990
like returned to the cities and be
like where are these buildings come?

1558
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:36,381
Sure.

1559
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:38,360
But when his case it was more of like,

1560
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:42,770
I think what he there they're mostly
pointing towards giant cataclysmic

1561
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:44,120
disasters that have,

1562
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:44,510
you know,

1563
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:48,080
all but wiped out a huge percentage of
the human race and then people have to

1564
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:48,914
start all over again.

1565
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,630
I mean the concept of what if today,

1566
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,140
okay,

1567
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,350
in 2011 like the Matrix third
metrics movie was that it was that,

1568
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,960
was that what happened
in the theater majors?

1569
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:58,070
They were like this is,

1570
00:42:58,071 --> 00:42:58,341
you know,

1571
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:02,870
permutation of a fucking equation that
it's essentially the message was this

1572
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:03,704
happened,

1573
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,990
there's the 16th time we've done this.

1574
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:11,380
Like we keep running you guys and
to turn to you guys is based yeah,

1575
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,430
that's based on an ancient Hindu system
or it's an Indian system called the

1576
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:15,980
[inaudible].

1577
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,880
That's I think,

1578
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,810
I don't know the full thing.

1579
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:19,550
Our friend Duncan's an
expert in this shit.

1580
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,240
But what do you,

1581
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,660
the way he explained it to me is that
this is Kali Yoga and the Kali Yoga is

1582
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:24,470
like the,

1583
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,710
the most chaotic stage
of the human existence.

1584
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:30,620
And we have this normal
natural progression from like,

1585
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:30,861
you know,

1586
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:32,540
sensible to wild,

1587
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:34,130
the crazy to completely out of control,

1588
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,390
which is where we are now.

1589
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,300
And to the next stage is some
sort of an enlightenment,

1590
00:43:38,301 --> 00:43:40,010
some sort of a learning from this,

1591
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,053
some sort of a,

1592
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,770
a next passage that goes through.

1593
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:46,820
And then the idea is that we're that
humanities in this continuous cycle and

1594
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:47,241
that it's,

1595
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:47,601
you know,

1596
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:48,740
we like to think of ourselves,

1597
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:53,480
it hasn't having a direct
linear projection from
monkey to human being in 2011

1598
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:57,590
but in fact it may have hit this peak
thousands and thousands and thousands of

1599
00:43:57,591 --> 00:44:01,550
years ago and then been shut down by
some horrible disaster that killed almost

1600
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:05,540
everybody and that almost
everybody forgets about it
because you kill like half

1601
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:06,850
the fucking people and mandate,

1602
00:44:06,851 --> 00:44:07,370
you know,

1603
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,480
w w good luck,

1604
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,950
good luck piecing things together,

1605
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:11,180
writing things down.

1606
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:11,990
You know,

1607
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,820
paper gets d disappears.

1608
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:15,380
They burned the library of Alexandria,

1609
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:17,150
they all saw the records for Egypt.

1610
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:20,870
Everything they have left to just shit
carved in snow or it carved in stone.

1611
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:21,410
Rather.

1612
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:21,711
It's like,

1613
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:21,891
you know,

1614
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:25,250
you want to really get the
full history of the human race.

1615
00:44:25,251 --> 00:44:26,390
It's really complicated.

1616
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:29,990
It's like we don't really know
what happened 10,000 years ago.

1617
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:34,020
We don't really know what happened 15
20,000 and in the course of the universe

1618
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,670
or the course of the life of this planet,

1619
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:37,530
that's a fucking half
of a blink of the eye.

1620
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,120
It's almost like as a race,

1621
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:43,290
we have woken up at a certain level
where we started writing things down like

1622
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,730
we'll call it a thousand years ago,

1623
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:45,481
whatever the fuck it was,

1624
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:47,160
where people really started
writing things down.

1625
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,430
It's almost like we're just slowly
piecing this fucking thing together.

1626
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:51,420
As it's moving,

1627
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,640
it's moving into the reaction.

1628
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,730
People just starting to write things down,

1629
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:53,851
okay,

1630
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:55,110
this is what happens in
this and this and this.

1631
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,340
Then the next people come along and go,

1632
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:56,551
okay,

1633
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:57,390
they already figured this out.

1634
00:44:57,391 --> 00:44:57,541
Okay,

1635
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:58,374
what else can we figure it out?

1636
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:02,010
Then we got to figure this out and they're
all moving along as life is moving,

1637
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,610
constantly trying to Riyadh to
this fucking pile of awakening.

1638
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,770
I try to describe this life that were
just born in the middle of mid momentum,

1639
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,120
hit the ground running.

1640
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:15,450
As soon as you could walk your golf to
school and you're a fucking cog in the

1641
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:16,960
wheel boom and,

1642
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:17,581
and you know,

1643
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:20,820
and very little time to sit down and
think about what the fuck it really is.

1644
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,270
The notion of a,

1645
00:45:22,271 --> 00:45:23,120
it's all occurring.

1646
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,310
Like we're waking up the renaissance
of sorts when somebody writing it down,

1647
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:27,671
number one,

1648
00:45:27,671 --> 00:45:28,720
I thought that was really sweet,

1649
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:29,681
but number two,

1650
00:45:29,681 --> 00:45:32,770
the notion of doing that
while you're moving,

1651
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,200
like moving forward still,

1652
00:45:35,201 --> 00:45:37,450
you can't stop time and tell people like,

1653
00:45:37,451 --> 00:45:38,284
wait,

1654
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,840
let me catch up and write everything down.

1655
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:41,670
So far.

1656
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:42,160
Yeah.

1657
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:42,671
Like they,

1658
00:45:42,671 --> 00:45:44,410
you'd have to start fucking swimming.

1659
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:45,310
You're absolutely right.

1660
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,240
That's kind of evocative.

1661
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,350
That was a really beautiful image.

1662
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:47,980
Well done.

1663
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,790
Thanks.

1664
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:49,310
Yeah,

1665
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:49,811
I'm a writer.

1666
00:45:49,811 --> 00:45:50,401
I appreciate it.

1667
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:51,020
Some good words,

1668
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,731
but as well done.

1669
00:45:51,731 --> 00:45:53,170
You took me right fucking there.

1670
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:54,660
You sold the game mean,

1671
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,391
but that is what,

1672
00:45:55,391 --> 00:45:56,141
that is what we're doing,

1673
00:45:56,141 --> 00:45:56,470
right?

1674
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:56,800
Yeah.

1675
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,320
We try to think,

1676
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,300
I don't know,

1677
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:00,970
boy,

1678
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,980
now you're making the
move in one direction.

1679
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:03,843
The human.

1680
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:08,230
If you just look at the idea that
we're constantly creating new things,

1681
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,840
constantly trying to
improve on the technology,

1682
00:46:10,841 --> 00:46:12,420
it's Kinda reached some fucking nuts

1683
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,900
point sometime in the future
when machines take over.

1684
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,450
Yeah,

1685
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:16,220
man,

1686
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,260
this Kurt's wheel Rickerts wields.

1687
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,850
He's one of those futurists that believes
in it as a lot of other guys who have

1688
00:46:22,851 --> 00:46:25,040
a very unroll the prediction.

1689
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:25,581
You know,

1690
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:26,381
there's a lot of people that,

1691
00:46:26,381 --> 00:46:26,750
you know,

1692
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,830
think that we have been so desensitized
by the Terminator being a movie,

1693
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,100
right?

1694
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:35,210
But we think it's silly that we don't
recognize that this is a fucking real

1695
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:36,330
problem at skynet.

1696
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,183
Could be.

1697
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:37,821
And what do we,

1698
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:40,250
what are we thinking that we're going
to create something that's going to have

1699
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,120
autonomy.

1700
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,560
We're going to create
something that has a,

1701
00:46:42,561 --> 00:46:45,440
you were gonna want to know
if it can turn itself on.

1702
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:46,730
We're going to want to figure that out.

1703
00:46:46,731 --> 00:46:49,220
We're going to want to know if we can
make something like a repair itself.

1704
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,740
We're gonna want to know if we can
make something that can clone itself,

1705
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:54,710
given enough time with human
beings monkeying around with shit.

1706
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,540
We're eventually going to hit that point,

1707
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:56,870
man.

1708
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:58,250
You're talking about singularity?

1709
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,233
Yeah,

1710
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,700
it's an instant evitable
it seems in our lifetime.

1711
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,660
It's a captivating,

1712
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:03,730
the

1713
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:04,081
notion,

1714
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:04,740
I read the,

1715
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,320
I forget either time or Newsweek
did a wonderful article on it,

1716
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:09,280
but the way they described it though,

1717
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:11,760
it was very evocative
and as much as they said,

1718
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:16,770
think about how like the first computer,

1719
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:17,611
you know,

1720
00:47:17,611 --> 00:47:22,611
fill a couple rooms and it's equating
power wasn't even a 10th of what your

1721
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,950
phone can do right now.

1722
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,860
And that was going back to what,

1723
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:30,070
how years ago was that?

1724
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,390
50 60 years ago.

1725
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,110
Yeah.

1726
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:34,300
So in that piece they said,

1727
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:39,010
imagine what's going to
be in 30 years from now.

1728
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,940
From this moment.

1729
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:40,410
No,

1730
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:41,850
there's like this phone exist,

1731
00:47:41,851 --> 00:47:42,491
the phone,

1732
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:43,301
the computer,

1733
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:43,901
the outs,

1734
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:44,950
outs with a piece.

1735
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:48,040
I mean Steve Jobs said it
himself a couple of months back.

1736
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:48,481
He was like,

1737
00:47:48,481 --> 00:47:50,050
when he was talking about doing the cloud,

1738
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:50,351
he's like,

1739
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:51,670
the hardware's not the,

1740
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,050
the sole anymore.

1741
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:54,490
It's just a conduit and whatnot.

1742
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,390
It's not going to be ring tones.

1743
00:47:56,391 --> 00:47:57,450
You know the future's going to be,

1744
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,940
you going to be able
to talk to each other.

1745
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,111
I'm going to be able to go,

1746
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:00,381
dude,

1747
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:01,214
where are you?

1748
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:04,400
And people are going to get upset
if you don't let them do that.

1749
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:05,840
Like girls are going to get upset.

1750
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,760
Why can't I just talk to you
whenever I want to talk to you?

1751
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,031
What?

1752
00:48:08,031 --> 00:48:08,670
Like shining.

1753
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:08,791
Yeah,

1754
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:09,420
like you want this?

1755
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:09,891
You want no,

1756
00:48:09,891 --> 00:48:10,910
you want the fucking cell phone.

1757
00:48:10,911 --> 00:48:11,570
You want the ring?

1758
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:14,600
You want to ring so you can look at it
and decide whether or not to answer but

1759
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:17,440
if someone can make the cell phone rang.

1760
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:22,170
I thought you were saying like in the
future we won't need phones talking to it

1761
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,860
might not even have to be a phone.

1762
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:25,310
It might not.

1763
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:25,821
You're right.

1764
00:48:25,821 --> 00:48:26,840
It might not even have to be a phone,

1765
00:48:26,841 --> 00:48:28,670
but I think initially it's going
to start out with ringtones.

1766
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,910
The first thing that's going to be
the dams gonna break is instead of a

1767
00:48:31,911 --> 00:48:32,340
ringtone.

1768
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:32,481
Why?

1769
00:48:32,481 --> 00:48:35,720
Why can't they set it up so I
can talk to you in the ringtone?

1770
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:36,351
Hey Kevin,

1771
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,621
it's me.

1772
00:48:36,621 --> 00:48:36,891
Joe,

1773
00:48:36,891 --> 00:48:37,521
pick up the phone,

1774
00:48:37,521 --> 00:48:37,761
dude,

1775
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:37,911
I,

1776
00:48:37,911 --> 00:48:39,290
this is fucking super important.

1777
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,250
I hate to be bugging you,

1778
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:41,061
but pick up the phone.

1779
00:48:41,061 --> 00:48:42,890
Almost like an answering Michigan prereqs.

1780
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,330
That's what you're hearing.

1781
00:48:44,331 --> 00:48:45,021
When the phone rings,

1782
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:45,950
you're hearing your friend say,

1783
00:48:45,951 --> 00:48:46,211
dude,

1784
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:47,690
pick up the fucking phone right now.

1785
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,490
Almost like old school answering machine.

1786
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:49,941
You know,

1787
00:48:49,941 --> 00:48:51,200
that will be the first option.

1788
00:48:51,201 --> 00:48:52,970
And people would get
that because they'll say,

1789
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:53,211
honey,

1790
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:56,240
what if it's an emergency and this some
shit goes down and I need to get in

1791
00:48:56,241 --> 00:48:56,930
touch with you.

1792
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:57,201
Yeah,

1793
00:48:57,201 --> 00:48:57,681
you're right.

1794
00:48:57,681 --> 00:48:58,041
Okay.

1795
00:48:58,041 --> 00:48:58,791
And then people go,

1796
00:48:58,791 --> 00:48:59,271
what the fuck?

1797
00:48:59,271 --> 00:49:00,140
Where are you bitch?

1798
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,340
I'm fucking calling you right now.

1799
00:49:01,341 --> 00:49:04,180
I'm going to keep calling you
every fucking dude and you'll,

1800
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,840
you'll be able to harass that person.

1801
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:08,000
Literally yell at them until they
shut their fucking phone off.

1802
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,440
That that will be step one.

1803
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,960
And then eventually there
will be no more phone.

1804
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:13,250
They're gonna figure out some way,

1805
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:15,770
whether it's a neural
implants or you know,

1806
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:16,320
yeah,

1807
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,480
I think it's neural implants.

1808
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:18,280
Well,

1809
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:18,810
implying

1810
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:19,980
30 years from now,

1811
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,770
the phone will be
insertable into your head.

1812
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,000
This is a tiny,

1813
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,930
it'll be like this.

1814
00:49:24,931 --> 00:49:26,160
And there's that material.

1815
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,660
What does it call this?

1816
00:49:27,661 --> 00:49:30,550
The shit that's like as
thin as Saran fiber optics.

1817
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,950
I don't know if that's it.

1818
00:49:31,951 --> 00:49:33,000
This is new material.

1819
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:34,200
It's about thin as a,

1820
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,020
probably can't be that new
fiber optics is old as fuck.

1821
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:37,531
That's it.

1822
00:49:37,531 --> 00:49:39,180
And I don't think it's
that I'm talking to myself.

1823
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,550
It's then like they showed a piece of,

1824
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:43,890
it looks like a piece of Saran wrap,

1825
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,390
but it's the strength of it
is like fucking concrete,

1826
00:49:48,391 --> 00:49:50,160
like 16 layers of concrete.

1827
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:55,460
And they're saying it also
has fold ability so you can
roll it up and bundle it

1828
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,440
up and it's also made of sand or whatever,

1829
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:58,741
you know,

1830
00:49:58,741 --> 00:49:59,700
fucking silicon.

1831
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,780
So it's conductive.

1832
00:50:00,781 --> 00:50:01,770
So they're saying,

1833
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,110
imagine you had or like this.

1834
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:04,861
Yeah,

1835
00:50:04,861 --> 00:50:05,671
this looks Kinda so,

1836
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:06,510
I don't know what these are,

1837
00:50:06,511 --> 00:50:08,070
but these ties,

1838
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:09,803
is that what it is?

1839
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:11,730
Um,

1840
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:12,563
I want to smell it.

1841
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:17,630
If you had this and you could do this
with it or you could just roll it up real

1842
00:50:17,821 --> 00:50:19,770
tight and stick it in your ear,

1843
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:21,150
this would be your phone.

1844
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:21,841
They're like,

1845
00:50:21,841 --> 00:50:23,670
shape is no longer a problem.

1846
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,230
Like this is the material.

1847
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:28,190
It's like when you watched
the fucking Batman begins,

1848
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,040
he's got that memory cloth for the Cape
or little electric charge to it in a

1849
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:32,883
titans.

1850
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:33,951
Same thing here.

1851
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:34,370
They only let,

1852
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:35,270
you don't need to tighten it.

1853
00:50:35,271 --> 00:50:35,601
They're like,

1854
00:50:35,601 --> 00:50:36,590
it's all flexible.

1855
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:37,311
Everything,

1856
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:38,690
all the conductors are inside.

1857
00:50:38,691 --> 00:50:42,020
So it will do exactly what it
needs to have that for a armor,

1858
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:43,040
for motorcycle riders.

1859
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:43,874
Now I know,

1860
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,920
I think they'll have some
shit when you hit the ground.

1861
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:48,200
The impact of like
flattens it out it hard.

1862
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:48,310
I,

1863
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:48,461
yeah,

1864
00:50:48,461 --> 00:50:52,310
I don't know if that's in testing
or if that's actually a good sale.

1865
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,720
I saw that video.

1866
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,570
But one of the things they've come out
recently with and a know a lot of people

1867
00:50:56,571 --> 00:50:56,961
say like,

1868
00:50:56,961 --> 00:50:57,321
man,

1869
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:58,740
you guys always talk
about the fucking soon.

1870
00:50:58,741 --> 00:50:59,301
You already know.

1871
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:00,020
Tell her to hearing this.

1872
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,270
Like that's like number one
complaint in the podcast.

1873
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,400
And I admit it because I
fucking drone on about it.

1874
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:04,641
Why?

1875
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:06,810
Because I a gang.

1876
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,190
Yeah.

1877
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,450
And when I see things like this,

1878
00:51:08,451 --> 00:51:08,661
okay.

1879
00:51:08,661 --> 00:51:09,020
Look,

1880
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,960
artificial skin made from spider silk.

1881
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:12,611
Yes.

1882
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,400
Bullet proof.

1883
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,360
Isn't that amazing,

1884
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,841
dude?

1885
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:15,980
I'm going to get bulletproof scan.

1886
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:16,731
It's going to be awesome.

1887
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:18,020
I can't wait until this is legal.

1888
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:19,520
I'm going to get a full bar.

1889
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:20,420
They're going to skin me.

1890
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,100
They're going to try to
keep me alive by the skin.

1891
00:51:22,101 --> 00:51:22,430
Me.

1892
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:24,980
And then they replace your
skin with bulletproof.

1893
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,720
Spiders get silk skin.

1894
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:28,310
How crazy is it?

1895
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:29,480
How many people are going
to sign up for that?

1896
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:30,680
You don't want to be an early adoptee.

1897
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:31,610
It's like fake lips.

1898
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,391
Read the ingredient.

1899
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:33,590
Wait until they get that shit down.

1900
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,130
You know,

1901
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,430
he didn't want to fucking big
stitches under your armpits.

1902
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:37,550
Yeah,

1903
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:39,120
they live giant fuck and scars,

1904
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:39,590
Dude.

1905
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:40,341
I like my new skin.

1906
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:41,360
It's bulletproof and everything,

1907
00:51:41,361 --> 00:51:42,050
but a fucking hate.

1908
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,730
The scars read how they make it too.

1909
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:44,900
That's goat's milk.

1910
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,370
They put the enzyme or they weren't,

1911
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:47,690
you know,

1912
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:48,080
gee,

1913
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,340
they fucked with the genetics.

1914
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:49,881
The DNA,

1915
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:50,420
if you will.

1916
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,051
It's amazing,

1917
00:51:51,051 --> 00:51:55,230
man of this weird goat's milk and
made it like more like spiders.

1918
00:51:55,231 --> 00:51:56,400
So whatever the Goco,

1919
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:56,930
you know,

1920
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,190
whatever they milk out of the goat.

1921
00:51:58,191 --> 00:52:01,900
They spin into this fucking
hardest substance there that help.

1922
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:04,070
I was stronger than Kevlar.

1923
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:05,870
Dope is nature.

1924
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,470
Yeah.

1925
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:09,740
This crazy little giant
little fucking insect thing.

1926
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:12,140
This weird abdomen produces this shit.

1927
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,860
There was a line and
then this great Batman,

1928
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:16,051
oh,

1929
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:16,910
it was a swamp thing.

1930
00:52:16,911 --> 00:52:19,700
Issue that Batman was in years
ago that Alan Moore wrote.

1931
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:20,961
We're swamp thing.

1932
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:21,171
You know,

1933
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:22,010
he's an elemental,

1934
00:52:22,011 --> 00:52:22,230
he's,

1935
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:22,580
you know,

1936
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,590
get the power of nature
on a side and whatnot.

1937
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,281
Big swamp thing.

1938
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:26,410
Fan back in the Disney.

1939
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:26,961
So,

1940
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:27,230
uh,

1941
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,570
he attacks Gotham.

1942
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,361
They have his woman,

1943
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:30,790
they've tied up Abby Arcane,

1944
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,030
they've kept her in jail.

1945
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,630
They've arrested her because she's
cohabitated with the vegetative.

1946
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,040
A humanoid.

1947
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:37,760
Really?

1948
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:37,971
Yeah,

1949
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:38,804
the swamp thing.

1950
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:39,920
And so they put her in jail.

1951
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,450
She was supposed to be arrested in
Houma and they arrest restaurant,

1952
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,780
Gotham and stead and swamp thing is like,

1953
00:52:44,781 --> 00:52:45,680
we want to release.

1954
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:46,251
And they were like,

1955
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:46,731
we can't,

1956
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:47,001
she's,

1957
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:47,301
you know,

1958
00:52:47,301 --> 00:52:48,140
she committed a crime,

1959
00:52:48,141 --> 00:52:49,850
she's going to be healthier
on trial and whatnot.

1960
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,060
And swamp thing takes a
slowly ticks over Gotham.

1961
00:52:53,061 --> 00:52:53,721
He warns them,

1962
00:52:53,721 --> 00:52:53,991
you know,

1963
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:56,240
he just appears from
like can make himself,

1964
00:52:56,241 --> 00:52:56,721
as you know,

1965
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:59,420
out of any vegetative material whatsoever.

1966
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:03,890
It turns into a giant head and it's just
like release the woman or I will take

1967
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:04,491
the city,

1968
00:53:04,491 --> 00:53:04,861
you know,

1969
00:53:04,861 --> 00:53:06,020
and the end,

1970
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:07,730
the one issue with part one of like,

1971
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:07,941
you know,

1972
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:11,240
you see Gotham start falling into jungle.

1973
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,840
Like he just over vegetated everything
and people just go back to fucking

1974
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:15,351
nature.

1975
00:53:15,351 --> 00:53:16,280
He takes the,

1976
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:18,410
takes the city and turns
it back into the jungle.

1977
00:53:18,411 --> 00:53:22,040
In the last panel is a high
view of all this of course.

1978
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:23,370
And standing on a Gargoyles,

1979
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:26,130
the one motherfucker who does
not want anything to go back

1980
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,230
to the jungle and it's Batman.

1981
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:29,700
Powerful fucking book.

1982
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:30,751
But at one point,

1983
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,584
second issue,

1984
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,960
swamp thing has this line where he
goes to us like if nature but shrugged,

1985
00:53:35,961 --> 00:53:36,530
you'd be all,

1986
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,150
you'd all be gone or something
very powerful like that.

1987
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:43,650
But it's the if nature but shrug line
that always got me cause he was talking

1988
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:46,230
about we think we command everything.

1989
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:47,064
We think we're,

1990
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,290
we've mastered shit we know are dumb.

1991
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,520
But it's just that you've talked about
before a cataclysmic event that wipes out

1992
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,260
half the planet or something like that.

1993
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:57,090
That's if nature but shrugs.

1994
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:58,620
It happens out here.

1995
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,161
You know,

1996
00:53:59,161 --> 00:54:00,540
when we feel the tremors,

1997
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:05,220
the earthquakes were reminded all the
time that surface fleas as George Carlin

1998
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:06,090
described as,

1999
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:06,960
um,

2000
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,900
but when you see nature going
crazy with the weather and whatnot,

2001
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:11,040
and you start sitting there going,

2002
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:11,251
oh,

2003
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:11,461
like,

2004
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:14,850
do you remember that George Carlin bit
where he talked about how the planets

2005
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,080
find the people are fucked,

2006
00:54:16,081 --> 00:54:17,190
him and his legendary bit.

2007
00:54:17,191 --> 00:54:18,060
But you know,

2008
00:54:18,061 --> 00:54:22,440
he starts theorizing on like the planet
trying to pick us off with disease and

2009
00:54:22,441 --> 00:54:23,280
shit like that.

2010
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:24,410
Um,

2011
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:24,610
and,

2012
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:27,240
and you start seeing every
time I see a natural disaster,

2013
00:54:27,241 --> 00:54:28,170
it's all I could think about it.

2014
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,910
I was just like the
planets after us again,

2015
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:34,430
they found the world's largest
pyramid by volume in Guatemala,

2016
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,040
expectantly they founded
a couple of years ago.

2017
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,040
It's enormous by volume,

2018
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:39,874
like a cigarette.

2019
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:41,263
Whereas the pyramid,

2020
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:42,740
it's like a Mayan pyramid.

2021
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:42,981
You know,

2022
00:54:42,981 --> 00:54:43,791
the Mayan Pyramids,

2023
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:45,860
they weren't smooth like
the Egyptian pyramids,

2024
00:54:45,861 --> 00:54:49,130
but they all went into that
same shape essentially.

2025
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:49,551
Well,

2026
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:51,590
they found it in Guatemala,

2027
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,390
covered in jungle.

2028
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:53,961
I mean,

2029
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:56,300
this is just a totally lost,

2030
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,110
amazing civilization covered in jungle.

2031
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:05,150
And they think there might be thousands
of these thousands of these all

2032
00:55:05,151 --> 00:55:06,290
throughout South America,

2033
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,130
thousands of lost temples and pyramids.

2034
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,930
This incredible civilization that existed
that made these immense structures in

2035
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:16,660
a place that's so nuts that the,

2036
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:20,300
the jungle just overgrew everything to
the point where they thought it was a

2037
00:55:20,301 --> 00:55:21,134
mountain,

2038
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:24,020
they thought it was a mountain and they
start excavating it and find out it's

2039
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:28,300
the biggest fucking pyramid by
volume on earth when it does happen.

2040
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:30,800
2009 apparently they had it on CNN.

2041
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:31,280
I was a,

2042
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,560
somebody just posted it
recently and I tweeted it.

2043
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:34,620
It's a a,

2044
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,391
it says though,

2045
00:55:35,391 --> 00:55:39,020
the thing on Youtube is world's largest
pyramid discovered like they lost this

2046
00:55:39,021 --> 00:55:39,741
whole thing.

2047
00:55:39,741 --> 00:55:40,250
Man.

2048
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:44,000
People had moved out of there so much
to the point where there was nothing

2049
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:44,834
living there.

2050
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:49,610
It was just trees and the whole thing
just filled with grass and trees and

2051
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:53,720
someone had a come along thousands of
years later and kick something over and

2052
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:53,811
go,

2053
00:55:53,811 --> 00:55:54,380
what's this?

2054
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,220
Dig a little hole.

2055
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:55,611
Hey Man,

2056
00:55:55,611 --> 00:55:56,444
this is a brick.

2057
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:56,661
Hey,

2058
00:55:56,661 --> 00:55:58,700
bring over shovel and the next
thing you know they're like,

2059
00:55:58,701 --> 00:55:59,750
what the fuck is this?

2060
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,320
Slowly way up to imagine what that means.

2061
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,820
That experience must be like a
finding something like that as well.

2062
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,120
We have a phenomenal,

2063
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:08,481
I mean,

2064
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:09,110
well,

2065
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:09,943
well it's the top

2066
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:11,880
set of whatever Geraldo Rivera felt.

2067
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,350
Oh Fund up Al Capone's
vault and was like nothing.

2068
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:17,060
There's nothing in here.

2069
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,460
But the shock that this
could be left behind.

2070
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:20,420
The shock for this is,

2071
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,170
you know,

2072
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,120
thousands of years ago,

2073
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,940
can't even really wrap
our heads around that.

2074
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:28,810
They built this shit and it all went
bad and the fucking jungle overtook the

2075
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:29,644
land.

2076
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,140
You know,

2077
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,860
you go Atlanta's to go as
far back as Atlantis or no,

2078
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,090
do I believe in Atlanta?

2079
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:34,751
So there's some,

2080
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:37,420
some archeologists that believe
they founded off of Spain.

2081
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:37,871
In fact,

2082
00:56:37,871 --> 00:56:42,340
they have concentric rings that they've
found in a satellite view of the ocean.

2083
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,230
They somehow or another that you know,

2084
00:56:44,231 --> 00:56:44,560
they can,

2085
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,310
they can see like the topography of the
ocean from space and in the satellite

2086
00:56:48,311 --> 00:56:52,090
view they found this place that
literally matches the geography,

2087
00:56:52,091 --> 00:56:55,840
matches the area that it would be
matches the local layer matches.

2088
00:56:55,841 --> 00:56:56,081
You know,

2089
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:56,321
there's,

2090
00:56:56,321 --> 00:56:56,571
there's,

2091
00:56:56,571 --> 00:56:56,900
there's,

2092
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,650
there's folk layer that
that is attached to it.

2093
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,011
You know,

2094
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:01,790
that you could be attributed to history.

2095
00:57:01,791 --> 00:57:01,951
You know,

2096
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,130
you can tell you the actual history.

2097
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,960
So they believe that
they have found Atlantis.

2098
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,130
What Ha,

2099
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,200
what had happened to it.

2100
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:07,990
It just does.

2101
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,780
This place was a also
very subject to tsunamis.

2102
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:14,380
It's had many tsunamis before and they
think that's most likely what happened

2103
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,130
was that,

2104
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:15,431
you know,

2105
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,560
these people lived on a part of the sea,

2106
00:57:17,561 --> 00:57:19,210
they had an advanced civilization.

2107
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,830
It got really prosperous,

2108
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:24,280
but they weren't aware yet of
tsunamis and Chet along those lines,

2109
00:57:24,281 --> 00:57:26,860
like if you go a few thousand
years without a tsunami,

2110
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:28,120
it's not unheard of.

2111
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:33,490
It could mean can hope the world because
what hasn't happened in a few thousand

2112
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,590
years that we're aware of and
suddenly it's going to happen again.

2113
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:36,760
Well,

2114
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,930
especially on the west coast,

2115
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:38,200
man.

2116
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:38,411
I mean,

2117
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:42,850
we know that some big ones if hit I
believe up in as far north as like Seattle

2118
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:43,331
and Portland,

2119
00:57:43,331 --> 00:57:43,930
Oregon,

2120
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:44,021
uh,

2121
00:57:44,021 --> 00:57:44,920
hundreds of years ago,

2122
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:46,840
that place got fucked up by tsunamis.

2123
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:47,950
It's real possible.

2124
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:48,111
I mean,

2125
00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:50,020
the ocean is gigantic
and it's right there.

2126
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:50,521
But if,

2127
00:57:50,521 --> 00:57:50,650
uh,

2128
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:54,190
if my point is that if a few hundred
years go by and there's no tsunami,

2129
00:57:54,191 --> 00:57:55,150
that's not unusual.

2130
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:59,440
So if this civilization was allowed to
prosper and grow in a few hundred years,

2131
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,790
it could have been super advanced.

2132
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:03,460
We know that they could do
a bunch of things back in,

2133
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:03,850
you know,

2134
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,490
10,000 plus years ago that we
didn't think they could do.

2135
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:07,301
And we're,

2136
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:10,030
we're more and more figuring
out as time goes on,

2137
00:58:10,031 --> 00:58:12,510
but they might have been way more advanced
than we ever gave them credit for.

2138
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,960
They might've even have telescopes.

2139
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:14,560
Like there's,

2140
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,560
there's people that believe that they
found lenses that they get attribute to be

2141
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:18,640
being ground down.

2142
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:21,190
And some say that they're
not strong enough to,

2143
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:21,421
to,

2144
00:58:21,421 --> 00:58:21,610
to,

2145
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:22,930
to actually work as a telescope.

2146
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:23,771
But it could have been,

2147
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:24,250
you know,

2148
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,390
one of many.

2149
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,150
They could have evolved if they came up
with this initial idea and you found a

2150
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:29,140
bad version of it.

2151
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,750
Just the fact that they had figured
out that they can make something at a

2152
00:58:31,751 --> 00:58:32,860
crystal and look through it,

2153
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,480
that's some pretty advanced shit.

2154
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:35,471
What are you looking for?

2155
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:36,340
What are you doing with that?

2156
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:37,840
Is you sure that's just ornamental?

2157
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:39,190
And were they making telescopes?

2158
00:58:39,191 --> 00:58:40,300
Were they making microscopes?

2159
00:58:40,301 --> 00:58:41,111
What the fuck were they doing?

2160
00:58:41,111 --> 00:58:42,980
Were clearly says they're there,

2161
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,460
they're examining the unexamined
life is not worth living.

2162
00:58:48,461 --> 00:58:50,050
So there were philosophical people,

2163
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:50,980
they weren't,

2164
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,600
they were looking for answers.

2165
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:54,580
So it wasn't enough to just be like,

2166
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,713
feed me,

2167
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:56,710
feed me sex.

2168
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:57,850
It was enough to be like,

2169
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,650
I want to look beyond our world or deeper
into our right and a totally different

2170
00:59:02,651 --> 00:59:02,771
way.

2171
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:04,000
They did it from the way we did it,

2172
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:06,910
but we have this whole petrochemical
way of viewing the world and we think

2173
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:07,900
that's the only way to do it.

2174
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:09,160
And it may not be.

2175
00:59:09,161 --> 00:59:12,220
They may be that there's
some civilizations that
have reached some staggering

2176
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:14,980
heights without the use of that and we
just don't know how the fuck they did it.

2177
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:15,661
We need,

2178
00:59:15,661 --> 00:59:16,151
and we don't know how.

2179
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:19,390
They moved a lot of the great stones
to make giant structures throughout

2180
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:20,080
history.

2181
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,860
That's this great Graham Hancock,

2182
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:24,860
that's like his specialty
on this thing and he,

2183
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:28,850
he wrote a book called supernatural all
about his experiences with his IOWASCA.

2184
00:59:28,851 --> 00:59:32,420
This drinking is brew and all his
experiences with psychedelics and how

2185
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:36,500
empowering they've been to him and how
he believes that it's very likely that

2186
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:37,870
they are the source of,

2187
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:38,930
of human,

2188
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,080
a human culture and human knowledge
and human growth and it's shorter than

2189
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,180
social source of self awareness that
it probably started with psychedelic

2190
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:48,290
experiences and it's an,

2191
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:49,490
he's not the only one to say this.

2192
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,390
Mckenna believed it.

2193
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:51,230
As I said before,

2194
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,760
a lot of people echo it,

2195
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:53,893
but I just think,

2196
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,930
I think everyone who's creative,

2197
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,550
everyone who is an artist,

2198
00:59:58,551 --> 01:00:00,080
everyone who is a thinker,

2199
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:04,340
you deserve to go through an experience
with someone who knows what they're

2200
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:05,174
doing.

2201
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:08,900
That's why it should be legal and there
should be shamans and there should be

2202
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:11,930
someone who runs a center that
can evaluate whether or not,

2203
01:00:11,931 --> 01:00:12,291
first of all,

2204
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:14,930
you're psychologically capable
of handling such an experience,

2205
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,700
but give you the proper dosage,

2206
01:00:16,701 --> 01:00:17,840
keep you supervision.

2207
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,840
It should be something that people
encourage because it makes you a better

2208
01:00:20,841 --> 01:00:21,350
person.

2209
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:21,870
Mm.

2210
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:24,990
I'm back in the day that person existed,

2211
01:00:24,991 --> 01:00:27,440
he was the medicine man or Shelman.

2212
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:27,810
Yeah,

2213
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:28,441
in the Amazon.

2214
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:28,741
Right now,

2215
01:00:28,741 --> 01:00:30,530
the guys who make the ILS Osca well,

2216
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:30,811
well,

2217
01:00:30,811 --> 01:00:31,261
I can't,

2218
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:31,621
well,

2219
01:00:31,621 --> 01:00:31,871
I'm,

2220
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:31,970
you know,

2221
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:34,110
I guess there's no money in shamanism.

2222
01:00:34,111 --> 01:00:35,340
Is that why there's two tricky,

2223
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:35,881
no,

2224
01:00:35,881 --> 01:00:36,714
there's no money in it.

2225
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,741
If there was money,

2226
01:00:37,741 --> 01:00:38,551
they put you in jail.

2227
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:40,380
If you started getting
money for being a showman,

2228
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,370
they'll fucking lock you up.

2229
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:41,851
What are you doing?

2230
01:00:41,851 --> 01:00:42,241
Shaman?

2231
01:00:42,241 --> 01:00:42,510
What?

2232
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,080
What are you getting?

2233
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,550
We would have given these fucking people,

2234
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:45,300
lock them up.

2235
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,560
Chamonix check his house.

2236
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,060
Shammo I feel what?

2237
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:48,680
Uh,

2238
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:48,931
yeah,

2239
01:00:48,931 --> 01:00:50,130
I guess you can't practice.

2240
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,280
Know what Madison even
especially holistic medicine,

2241
01:00:53,281 --> 01:00:54,000
they get weird.

2242
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,660
First of all,

2243
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,370
I guarantee you on Twitter tonight,

2244
01:00:56,371 --> 01:00:59,280
you will be getting thousands of
people telling you to do mushrooms.

2245
01:00:59,430 --> 01:00:59,820
Yeah,

2246
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:00,930
no doubt that's going to happen.

2247
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:01,711
I'm telling you,

2248
01:01:01,711 --> 01:01:02,281
you've got to look,

2249
01:01:02,281 --> 01:01:02,941
I'm 41.

2250
01:01:02,941 --> 01:01:05,070
You've gotten me a lot
closer than anybody else.

2251
01:01:05,071 --> 01:01:05,821
Like my wife,

2252
01:01:05,821 --> 01:01:08,520
who I've been married
to and fucking for 12,

2253
01:01:08,521 --> 01:01:09,810
and respect to bond with your team.

2254
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,460
You aren't getting laid.

2255
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:12,294
Every problem.

2256
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:14,460
I told me years ago,

2257
01:01:14,461 --> 01:01:14,821
she's like,

2258
01:01:14,821 --> 01:01:16,170
you would really love mushrooms.

2259
01:01:16,171 --> 01:01:17,680
I can't believe you've
never done mushrooms.

2260
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:18,301
She's like,

2261
01:01:18,301 --> 01:01:19,710
we should get mushrooms
and do them together.

2262
01:01:19,711 --> 01:01:20,320
One Desk.

2263
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,300
I don't think I could go.

2264
01:01:21,301 --> 01:01:23,040
You're a very unusual thinker

2265
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,920
and I think it would only
aid in your thought process.

2266
01:01:25,921 --> 01:01:26,754
It'd be fascinating.

2267
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,530
You're sold down to earth as it is.

2268
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:28,771
Dude.

2269
01:01:28,771 --> 01:01:29,940
You're such a normal guy.

2270
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:30,480
Like,

2271
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:30,880
um,

2272
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,530
I don't know how you managed to
navigate the entire system of,

2273
01:01:34,531 --> 01:01:35,760
and you're in the movie system,

2274
01:01:35,761 --> 01:01:38,010
which I think is even more
ridiculous than my system.

2275
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:39,503
My system.

2276
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,651
I'm on the fringes.

2277
01:01:40,651 --> 01:01:42,120
I'm in like fucking,

2278
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:43,141
you know,

2279
01:01:43,141 --> 01:01:45,330
sports commentary and standup comedy.

2280
01:01:45,331 --> 01:01:45,890
That's really what,

2281
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:47,460
and occasionally fear factor.

2282
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:48,510
That's my um,

2283
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,100
fringed you're deep

2284
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,540
into the belly of bullshit,

2285
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:55,050
but it's amazing that
you've been able to do that.

2286
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,591
It's amazing.

2287
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:57,360
Even embark with alias actors,

2288
01:01:57,361 --> 01:02:00,930
you just have to give up ego and you'd
have to be willing to accept less.

2289
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,660
You've got to manage your expectations.

2290
01:02:02,661 --> 01:02:05,490
Something I learned by being
in my wife all these years,

2291
01:02:05,491 --> 01:02:07,620
this was a chick who didn't
want to marry a fat guy,

2292
01:02:07,621 --> 01:02:09,390
but she met one who she really liked.

2293
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,820
He is good and all other
ways except for that one,

2294
01:02:11,821 --> 01:02:15,550
she managed her expectations
and it all worked out for you.

2295
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,171
You know what I'm saying?

2296
01:02:16,171 --> 01:02:16,411
She's like,

2297
01:02:16,411 --> 01:02:17,130
Oh God can,

2298
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:17,970
I can deal with that.

2299
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,500
But the rest of the package good.

2300
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:22,770
You manage your expectations and
you can do that sort of thing.

2301
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:23,604
So for me,

2302
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,770
I always try to keep the ego in check,

2303
01:02:25,771 --> 01:02:27,060
manage the expectations,

2304
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:31,020
expectations in this business or everyone
should be paying attention to me.

2305
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,660
I should be the epicenter of
everything and I'm what's hot and blah,

2306
01:02:33,661 --> 01:02:33,811
blah,

2307
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:34,500
blah.

2308
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,110
And I've always accepted the fact
that that was never going to be me.

2309
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:40,150
So it was always content to just dwell
out here on the fringes and when you're

2310
01:02:40,151 --> 01:02:42,000
hired on the fringes that it's,

2311
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,710
I wouldn't say you're incorruptible,

2312
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,820
but it is,

2313
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,330
people aren't that interested
in corrupting you and,

2314
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:52,331
and you can also watch the corruption
go on deep in the center of the bullshit

2315
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:53,544
as you say.

2316
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,970
And so while you're kind of not
above it but just outside of it,

2317
01:02:56,971 --> 01:02:59,880
it's a lot easier to see it
happening and stay away from it.

2318
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,920
When you see a movie like Conan,

2319
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:02,610
do you go,

2320
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:05,330
oh that must have been a
mass to work on and now I,

2321
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,570
when I see it I was just the,

2322
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:06,991
I see,

2323
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:07,741
I mean I didn't see it,

2324
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:09,870
but if I saw a movie like
Kona and I'd be like,

2325
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:10,621
Oh man,

2326
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:15,450
could you imagine how many people
put in so much time into this?

2327
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:17,520
And then it didn't take off like that's,

2328
01:03:17,521 --> 01:03:20,100
I see the expense is all
I see now is the money.

2329
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,050
I watch any movie and I'm just like,

2330
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:23,760
oh perfect.

2331
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:25,230
Conan too though could have done it.

2332
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:25,950
Should have done it.

2333
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:26,701
Why didn't that work?

2334
01:03:26,701 --> 01:03:26,851
Did.

2335
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:28,500
I saw that trailer and I was just like,

2336
01:03:28,501 --> 01:03:28,951
all right,

2337
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:32,850
I'm a huge fan of the Arnold Kona and
that was my cone and I didn't even,

2338
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,640
I wasn't aware of they were making the
Cornell movie until I saw the trailer.

2339
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:35,911
I was like,

2340
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:36,744
what the fuck?

2341
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,250
Why would anyone bother?

2342
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,250
And I watched it.

2343
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:39,660
I was like,

2344
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:39,781
Oh,

2345
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:40,261
you know what?

2346
01:03:40,261 --> 01:03:43,080
This is a lot closer to the real Kona
m and fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger.

2347
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:44,300
It was very close.

2348
01:03:44,301 --> 01:03:46,400
It just got stupid too many times.

2349
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:49,600
It just lost it went off the track and
into the woods too many times was that

2350
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:51,650
dude as a character was great.

2351
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:54,770
He would've been an awesome Conan in
the under the right direction with the

2352
01:03:54,771 --> 01:03:55,401
right script.

2353
01:03:55,401 --> 01:03:59,420
But I wrote a red rather a something
that the guy who made it wrote and he

2354
01:03:59,421 --> 01:04:02,390
talked about as original script and
how it got butchered all the way.

2355
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,530
And that's make sense.

2356
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,990
Like when you see something
so disjointed where so much,

2357
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,640
so many parts of it were awesome.

2358
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:10,730
Like the little kid in the
beginning that was fucking bad ass.

2359
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:12,260
You didn't see him for the new Kona.

2360
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:12,411
Yeah.

2361
01:04:12,411 --> 01:04:14,510
He didn't see the Newtonian yet save it.

2362
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:15,980
But if you do see it,

2363
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,150
this part is what I,

2364
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:20,060
a huge fan of the Old Komeito
while I'm a robbery Howard fan man.

2365
01:04:20,061 --> 01:04:21,490
So you go back deeper as,

2366
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:21,830
all right.

2367
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,210
So as a Howard Fan,

2368
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,073
did you see uh,

2369
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,170
what was that movie about him with
Renee Zellweger and you know what,

2370
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:28,891
that's an offer.

2371
01:04:28,891 --> 01:04:30,140
He bought that movie.

2372
01:04:30,141 --> 01:04:32,450
I have it in the back of my fucking shelf,

2373
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:33,261
my DVD shelf,

2374
01:04:33,261 --> 01:04:35,810
and I've never watched one
of those world if I forget.

2375
01:04:35,811 --> 01:04:35,900
Yeah.

2376
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:36,733
But anyway,

2377
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:37,940
if as a fan,

2378
01:04:37,941 --> 01:04:38,780
as a Howard fan,

2379
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:41,930
did you like the Arnold's
Conan or did you feel like,

2380
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:45,940
is it like a reading the shining
book versus the coopers shining?

2381
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:48,390
It's like they cartoon
to find it for sure.

2382
01:04:48,391 --> 01:04:53,391
The CONAN was much more ruthless and
brutal and bloody and it was way crazy.

2383
01:04:54,631 --> 01:04:55,930
Like I say soft and Tim,

2384
01:04:55,931 --> 01:04:56,820
you feel oh yeah.

2385
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:58,050
Both of them softened him.

2386
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:58,770
Yeah.

2387
01:04:58,770 --> 01:04:59,580
I mean he was,

2388
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,270
he was,

2389
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:00,480
uh,

2390
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:00,931
you know,

2391
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:03,810
like it was a compassionate guy
and he always did the right thing.

2392
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:06,300
But he was fucking hack and
heads off left and right.

2393
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:06,571
I mean,

2394
01:05:06,571 --> 01:05:07,540
it was just a mean.

2395
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:12,000
He was just a barbarian making its way
through magic and sorcery and monsters

2396
01:05:12,001 --> 01:05:14,310
and fucking hordes of ogres and I mean,

2397
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:16,890
they were just crazy ass
fucking wild stories.

2398
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,120
Robert Howard was a bad motherfucker,

2399
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:22,930
but he was ultimately crazy and one
of them blown in his own brains out.

2400
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:25,360
I think it was like 36 or
something was a whole wide world.

2401
01:05:25,361 --> 01:05:26,290
That's the name of the movie,

2402
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:27,490
I think the wholesale what it is.

2403
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:28,150
Yeah.

2404
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:28,930
He killed himself.

2405
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:29,181
Yeah,

2406
01:05:29,181 --> 01:05:29,431
yeah,

2407
01:05:29,431 --> 01:05:29,681
yeah.

2408
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:32,350
He just was so into his fucking his,

2409
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,120
his world of fantasy.

2410
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:34,871
We so good at it,

2411
01:05:34,871 --> 01:05:36,190
but his real life just sucked.

2412
01:05:36,191 --> 01:05:37,450
Man is real life.

2413
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:38,440
He just was miserable.

2414
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:39,161
He hated it.

2415
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:43,480
And he made this character this with
whatever pain that he was going through in

2416
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,290
his real life.

2417
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:46,870
He poured it into this
character being powerful.

2418
01:05:46,871 --> 01:05:47,201
You know,

2419
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:48,010
it's just dumb.

2420
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:48,230
He,

2421
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:50,950
they weren't just straight
Scifi fantasy books.

2422
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:52,060
There were so consistent.

2423
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:52,420
Right.

2424
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:52,631
You know,

2425
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:52,810
they were,

2426
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:53,770
there was some great ones,

2427
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:54,011
man,

2428
01:05:54,011 --> 01:05:54,850
I fucking loved him.

2429
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:58,630
You would buy him the paper bags with
the Frank Frazetta fucking oil paintings

2430
01:05:58,631 --> 01:05:59,500
on the cover of him.

2431
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:00,550
Holy Shit.

2432
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:01,660
You know,

2433
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:02,890
I mean those were books,

2434
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:03,370
man.

2435
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:05,980
That was some amazing shit that
you read the comics as well.

2436
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:06,281
Yeah,

2437
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:07,030
I did.

2438
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:09,730
One of my saddest moments in my life
is when I was so poor when I was a

2439
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:11,860
struggling comedian that I had
to sell all my comic books,

2440
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:17,030
which was sold everything I
sold my Spiderman is my Conan's,

2441
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:18,910
mostly marvel at marvel.

2442
01:06:18,911 --> 01:06:20,770
And then I had a lot
of like creepy and ear.

2443
01:06:20,771 --> 01:06:21,250
He,

2444
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:21,491
you know,

2445
01:06:21,491 --> 01:06:21,971
those uh,

2446
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:23,050
independent magazines.

2447
01:06:23,051 --> 01:06:23,771
You make rent,

2448
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:24,670
just rent it for a month.

2449
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,030
Barely.

2450
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:26,030
I've probably got some food.

2451
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,180
I got 150 bucks for everything.

2452
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:28,670
And I mean,

2453
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:32,610
you're talking to years of collecting
and the guy was totally screwed me,

2454
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,820
but I needed the money.

2455
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:34,900
It's probably hard to sell,

2456
01:06:34,901 --> 01:06:35,260
man,

2457
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:35,561
you know?

2458
01:06:35,561 --> 01:06:35,981
I mean,

2459
01:06:35,981 --> 01:06:37,120
he's probably got to go through a lot.

2460
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:38,320
He needs to make some money off of it.

2461
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,680
I've put together,

2462
01:06:39,681 --> 01:06:40,850
we're trying to make clerks,

2463
01:06:40,851 --> 01:06:41,250
I don't know.

2464
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,560
I was going to need money to make it.

2465
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:44,440
And I was a big comic book fan.

2466
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:46,610
I hadn't been collecting
a hardcore for that long,

2467
01:06:46,611 --> 01:06:48,410
was more all modern age stuff.

2468
01:06:48,411 --> 01:06:50,630
I didn't go back and buy
any golden or silver age,

2469
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:53,840
but still I did an evaluation
in that collection man.

2470
01:06:53,841 --> 01:06:54,500
It was like,

2471
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:54,860
I don't know,

2472
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,510
20,000 and change or whatever,

2473
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,530
$20,000 with the comic books based
on the book value book value.

2474
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:01,371
So I said,

2475
01:07:01,371 --> 01:07:02,204
okay,

2476
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,201
I'm going to go into,

2477
01:07:03,201 --> 01:07:03,530
yeah,

2478
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:06,800
of course over over maybe Overstreet
I might've used on that point.

2479
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:07,521
Um,

2480
01:07:07,521 --> 01:07:08,600
so I go,

2481
01:07:08,601 --> 01:07:09,434
okay,

2482
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:10,461
this collection,

2483
01:07:10,461 --> 01:07:12,350
then I'll sell it for 10 k.

2484
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:17,720
And so I go to a bunch of comp look a it
shows and a bunch of comic book dealers

2485
01:07:17,721 --> 01:07:18,590
and stores.

2486
01:07:18,591 --> 01:07:21,800
And this is 1991,

2487
01:07:21,801 --> 01:07:22,311
92,

2488
01:07:22,311 --> 01:07:22,910
let's say nine,

2489
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:23,091
no,

2490
01:07:23,091 --> 01:07:26,270
93 94 cause no 92 93 92.

2491
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:31,490
And I give him my full
catalog of everything I have
with all the prices next to

2492
01:07:31,491 --> 01:07:31,551
it,

2493
01:07:31,551 --> 01:07:31,791
all the,

2494
01:07:31,791 --> 01:07:32,061
you know,

2495
01:07:32,061 --> 01:07:36,140
the guide prices and then the wrap
up of 10,000 bucks like you know,

2496
01:07:36,141 --> 01:07:38,870
and it's a collection that's worth
more than that you can have for 10 k.

2497
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:40,340
Um,

2498
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:45,340
and nobody of course bit the
only people that bit was um,

2499
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,220
this comic book store and in Middletown,

2500
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,270
which was called what?

2501
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,113
Holy Crap,

2502
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,100
I'm getting old and I can't remember,

2503
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:54,470
but in any event they took,

2504
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:56,420
they took my comics,

2505
01:07:56,421 --> 01:08:01,421
they gave me $2,000 wait
for it in store credit.

2506
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:02,840
Oh.

2507
01:08:02,841 --> 01:08:07,841
So what I would do is sell my store
credit to my friend Walt flat again.

2508
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:09,171
I'd be like,

2509
01:08:09,171 --> 01:08:11,540
you go in comics plus that's
what the name of the store,

2510
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,840
you go in Cox plus you buy $100 where
the comics used my credit then give me 80

2511
01:08:17,601 --> 01:08:18,650
bucks cash.

2512
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:21,170
So he was always getting like 20% off.

2513
01:08:21,171 --> 01:08:23,480
So I wasn't even getting the fall two k.

2514
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:24,230
Wow.

2515
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:24,860
Yeah.

2516
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,693
Dang.

2517
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,890
But it made it paid for clerks.

2518
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:28,690
So there you go.

2519
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:32,480
Paid for a few bills that paid for
clerks until Miramax pick clerks up.

2520
01:08:32,481 --> 01:08:33,190
And then there was that.

2521
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:33,471
So,

2522
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:34,160
you know,

2523
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:39,160
I had never felt bad letting
go to collection because
it ultimately financed the

2524
01:08:39,351 --> 01:08:41,150
thing that made everything else possible.

2525
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:42,050
And then years later,

2526
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:42,291
you know,

2527
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:43,730
I just figured like if I want the books,

2528
01:08:43,731 --> 01:08:44,511
I go back and get them.

2529
01:08:44,511 --> 01:08:46,280
And I collected the ones I did want again.

2530
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:50,060
But then years later I just bought a
complex touring that was like buying a lot

2531
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:50,990
of comic book store.

2532
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:51,201
Yeah.

2533
01:08:51,201 --> 01:08:52,340
I got one in Red Bank,

2534
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,650
New Jersey called Jane's
Bob's secret stash.

2535
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:56,660
We have one out here in
Westwood for a little while,

2536
01:08:56,661 --> 01:09:00,010
but my friend got bored or running
it and then we wound up shattering.

2537
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:04,700
But the one back east has been
open since like 97 that podcast.

2538
01:09:04,701 --> 01:09:05,271
Tell Him Steve,

2539
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:09,350
David and my friends got
the show of on AMC that uh,

2540
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,350
that they record that at that comp.

2541
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,050
How much better our comic books on weed.

2542
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:15,760
I've,

2543
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,840
I haven't really written,

2544
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:18,920
I haven't read one yet.

2545
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:22,340
I've written a bunch and there's
so much more fun to ride on weed.

2546
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,010
So you haven't read any since
you've been smoking weed?

2547
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:25,770
No,

2548
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:30,590
I've been in a real non audience
mode for the last few years.

2549
01:09:30,591 --> 01:09:31,160
I don't,

2550
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,960
I don't read as much as I used to.

2551
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:34,700
I don't watch TV as much as I did.

2552
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,960
Just create your own shit.

2553
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:39,500
I've been on a real creation Jag
and you know it comes and goes.

2554
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:40,490
I think in cycles,

2555
01:09:40,491 --> 01:09:41,720
the old long you stick around,

2556
01:09:41,721 --> 01:09:46,721
the more he realized that like creatively
fertile and like in the early part of

2557
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:50,270
my career and then I get into career
management middle of the career and pay

2558
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:51,440
perhaps not as fertile.

2559
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,550
The ideas aren't as cool.

2560
01:09:52,551 --> 01:09:54,140
Maybe you start thinking more about like,

2561
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:54,974
well I got to eat,

2562
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,960
I got to make sure I got
another job after this,

2563
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,620
but now I'm back into a creatively fertile
period where it's just like I'm going

2564
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:01,221
to try this,

2565
01:10:01,221 --> 01:10:02,060
let me try this and that.

2566
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:03,440
You get a certain amount
of respectability,

2567
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:04,610
we can really do whatever you want.

2568
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:05,461
Yeah,

2569
01:10:05,461 --> 01:10:06,020
I think so.

2570
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:06,740
That's what you hit.

2571
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:07,730
That's why I'm like,

2572
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,590
you're crazy to say
that you're not famous,

2573
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:10,791
but I have,

2574
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:12,790
it's the name and I never
thought of it as kid.

2575
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,550
Doesn't matter.

2576
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,031
It doesn't matter.

2577
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:14,750
It's all nonsense.

2578
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,210
But what's important is the,

2579
01:10:16,211 --> 01:10:18,080
you're doing something very
different though though.

2580
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,010
The whole way you're doing it,

2581
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,560
the way you're doing it
with constantly being,

2582
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:23,870
putting out these podcasts mean you know,

2583
01:10:23,871 --> 01:10:25,520
just doing a podcast like this.

2584
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,180
You realize like how much of
who you are you put out there.

2585
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,040
I mean you just,

2586
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,880
you putting it out there
every day like that.

2587
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:34,910
It's about how bottomless
we are in terms of like,

2588
01:10:34,911 --> 01:10:39,050
if you can think about how many podcasts
you've done a couple that with all this

2589
01:10:39,051 --> 01:10:39,590
standup,

2590
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:43,700
you've done a couple that with every
real conversation you ever shared with

2591
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:46,370
somebody in your fucking life
and you're still not done,

2592
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:48,200
you still have so much more to say.

2593
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:48,861
We're,

2594
01:10:48,861 --> 01:10:53,861
we're unfathomably deep human beings
are deep creatures who can keep finding

2595
01:10:54,381 --> 01:10:55,640
things to talk about.

2596
01:10:55,641 --> 01:11:00,050
We talk because what else is there if
we're not communicating with ourselves

2597
01:11:00,051 --> 01:11:00,681
with each other,

2598
01:11:00,681 --> 01:11:01,490
what are we doing here?

2599
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,230
Especially now with the Internet.

2600
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,770
I mean that's the big difference
between now and 20 years ago world.

2601
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:09,080
That's why I say 20 years
ago I'd be fucking freaking
out that I didn't have the

2602
01:11:09,081 --> 01:11:10,430
Internet cause the come,

2603
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:14,460
you can choose the community you choose
to communicate the community that you

2604
01:11:14,461 --> 01:11:16,080
interact with and I bet you find,

2605
01:11:16,081 --> 01:11:18,060
even though you have a lot of
fucking people and your Twitter,

2606
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:19,710
I bet you find they're predominantly cool,

2607
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,220
aren't they?

2608
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:20,760
Yes.

2609
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,570
Across the board.

2610
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:24,390
So that's why I love Twitter
because it's so positive.

2611
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:24,630
Everything.

2612
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:25,980
Your fans feel good.

2613
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:26,341
Yeah.

2614
01:11:26,341 --> 01:11:30,360
You have 1,800,000 plus of
your fans tuned into you.

2615
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,660
We could tell them things and you could
clue them in on stuff all the time and

2616
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:34,950
they're excited and happy.

2617
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:35,900
It's all positive.

2618
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,460
They're predisposed to
say something positive.

2619
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,410
All of course you get the
random sniper jackass.

2620
01:11:41,411 --> 01:11:42,660
But generally it's just like,

2621
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:43,591
oh my God,

2622
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:45,510
I just watched clerks and it was great.

2623
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,160
And you know,

2624
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,960
I've never seen it before
or I had a real shitty day.

2625
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:50,610
Listen to the podcast feel great.

2626
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:51,061
Thanks.

2627
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:53,370
Are you know the today has
been the last two days?

2628
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,061
Well,

2629
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:55,410
I mean last week,

2630
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,760
two weeks when with the Canadian tour,

2631
01:11:56,761 --> 01:11:57,630
but the last day,

2632
01:11:57,870 --> 01:12:00,660
like not even full day
last 12 hours red state,

2633
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:02,910
but on VOD since I woke up this morning,

2634
01:12:02,911 --> 01:12:03,744
which was about,

2635
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,130
I think I got up at four Ivr.

2636
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:07,470
Ironically I wake up
around four 20 every day.

2637
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,970
I got up around fourish and it started
reading positive feedback is people can

2638
01:12:11,971 --> 01:12:12,930
watch it on Vod,

2639
01:12:12,931 --> 01:12:13,880
at their fucking house,

2640
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:16,200
on their computer because
people are watching it,

2641
01:12:16,201 --> 01:12:18,060
tweeting me while they're
watching it and do it.

2642
01:12:18,061 --> 01:12:18,580
It's like a,

2643
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:23,580
it's like a never ending series of
great job patting you on the back.

2644
01:12:23,611 --> 01:12:24,091
Like I said,

2645
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:24,901
I was saying before,

2646
01:12:24,901 --> 01:12:28,560
it costs nothing to encourage
an artist and the yield,

2647
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:31,140
the potential yield is,

2648
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,210
it is indescribable.

2649
01:12:33,211 --> 01:12:34,044
Think about it.

2650
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:34,860
You,

2651
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:38,520
you encourage an artist one day they
write that song that becomes that most

2652
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:42,150
important song in the world to you on
that day that your parent fucking dies.

2653
01:12:42,151 --> 01:12:43,350
The song that says it all,

2654
01:12:43,351 --> 01:12:45,260
that you'll always be dialed into.

2655
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:48,270
They were that person
maybe writes a blog that,

2656
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:48,751
oh,

2657
01:12:48,751 --> 01:12:52,200
puts the shit you always wanted to say
right into perspective and new meme it

2658
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,190
out to everybody.

2659
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:55,000
It's your becomes your mantra.

2660
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:58,470
They make movie that you know is
that movie that changed your life,

2661
01:12:58,471 --> 01:12:58,981
whatever,

2662
01:12:58,981 --> 01:12:59,460
man.

2663
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,540
There's all upside to
encouraging an artist.

2664
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:04,020
Nothing good comes from the flip side,

2665
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:05,230
discouraging an artist.

2666
01:13:05,231 --> 01:13:06,061
Now people be like,

2667
01:13:06,061 --> 01:13:06,241
well,

2668
01:13:06,241 --> 01:13:10,350
you should discourage some fucking artists
like you wee bowl or some were Kevin

2669
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:11,183
Smith I or the ELA.

2670
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:11,480
Well,

2671
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,000
Shit.

2672
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,833
You know what I'm saying?

2673
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,160
There's nothing bad.

2674
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:15,260
Nothing good comes from that.

2675
01:13:15,261 --> 01:13:16,620
You tell some of the are you stink,

2676
01:13:16,621 --> 01:13:17,580
don't do it anymore.

2677
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,781
What are they gonna do?

2678
01:13:18,781 --> 01:13:20,650
They stop and maybe they don't.

2679
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:21,750
Maybe you don't like them,

2680
01:13:21,751 --> 01:13:24,510
but maybe they don't inspire somebody
else or make somebody else think,

2681
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:24,721
hey,

2682
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:25,470
I can try it.

2683
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:26,011
You say that,

2684
01:13:26,011 --> 01:13:30,300
but what about the concept of the salmon
needing a waterfall to climb up to

2685
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:34,440
ensure that the strong gene survive
and if every person had told you,

2686
01:13:34,441 --> 01:13:35,610
Oh fuck Kevin Smith,

2687
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:39,900
those haters fueled you and gave you
extra inspiration to push further.

2688
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:42,150
Highlight that if these are
like your work like that.

2689
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:42,450
No,

2690
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:43,081
I try not to.

2691
01:13:43,081 --> 01:13:44,340
It's definitely a negative way to do it.

2692
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:46,260
I know a lot of fighters
use that as motivation.

2693
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:48,620
I had think you have to
in that lot of sliders,

2694
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:50,190
like they're his ears and also,

2695
01:13:50,191 --> 01:13:51,570
but think about it as a fighter.

2696
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,250
You have to get over.

2697
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,310
I know you said that primal
brain somewhere in there,

2698
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:59,880
but you got to get over the brain that
we've been dealing with for so many

2699
01:13:59,881 --> 01:14:00,091
years,

2700
01:14:00,091 --> 01:14:01,500
which is like don't get hurt,

2701
01:14:01,501 --> 01:14:02,110
don't go in there,

2702
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:02,490
don't,

2703
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:02,740
don't,

2704
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,660
don't run from danger protections.

2705
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:05,400
So,

2706
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,450
so right then and there,

2707
01:14:06,451 --> 01:14:08,880
that's why it's so exciting
differently than anybody else.

2708
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:11,430
They're going over
their program like dove,

2709
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:11,741
right?

2710
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:12,580
They're rewiring

2711
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:15,880
going in a different way and they have
to try to stay zen in the moment and not

2712
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:16,511
freak out.

2713
01:14:16,511 --> 01:14:17,140
And let it,

2714
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:20,290
the adrenaline and everything just
overwhelmed them and go into full panic.

2715
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:21,610
We had Shandling,

2716
01:14:21,611 --> 01:14:22,930
Garry Shandling was on the,

2717
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:23,530
on our,

2718
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:25,450
on our show it the house
one day and he was talking,

2719
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:29,320
he likes to box a big box and he was
talking about almost the same thing you

2720
01:14:29,321 --> 01:14:30,990
were in terms of like you're there,

2721
01:14:30,991 --> 01:14:32,080
they're not there it is.

2722
01:14:32,081 --> 01:14:37,081
So it's about being there and letting
go and it's an accounts out of you or he

2723
01:14:39,311 --> 01:14:40,160
was describing a half,

2724
01:14:40,161 --> 01:14:44,590
I forget how I described it in terms of
like just not being where the punch is

2725
01:14:44,591 --> 01:14:49,570
going to be and knowing that sooner or
later you will get punched but the more

2726
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:53,290
you're in this moment
like you eat once again,

2727
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:53,621
it's,

2728
01:14:53,621 --> 01:14:58,120
so what I find fascinating about as people
who can find or people getting a ring

2729
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,040
physical and not just like,

2730
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:01,840
oh we play some pickup basketball ship,

2731
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,910
but usually people get
into boxing fighting.

2732
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:08,200
They can be so poetic about it cause you
are channeling into something I guess

2733
01:15:08,201 --> 01:15:09,700
that most people don't.

2734
01:15:09,701 --> 01:15:13,360
We don't live in a world where we'd go
around fighting people or getting into

2735
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:15,610
physical altercations involving our body.

2736
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,790
So I think you guys do dial into
something because everyone he is,

2737
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:20,620
when you describe it for just a second,

2738
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:21,881
I go like,

2739
01:15:21,881 --> 01:15:22,301
yeah man,

2740
01:15:22,301 --> 01:15:23,470
I should fucking fight.

2741
01:15:23,471 --> 01:15:25,960
But I know I am not that guy.

2742
01:15:25,961 --> 01:15:28,150
Like in a minute I get in the
ring and be fucking taking,

2743
01:15:28,151 --> 01:15:28,984
you know,

2744
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:33,100
the thought of getting hit would
make me queasy and I pass out.

2745
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,510
But fighters,

2746
01:15:34,511 --> 01:15:35,350
people that do it,

2747
01:15:35,351 --> 01:15:40,351
people you know who've who've actually
been in a ring and and and fought or

2748
01:15:40,991 --> 01:15:44,970
continue to do it or so poetic about it
that they can almost sell you on it to

2749
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:45,611
the point of like,

2750
01:15:45,611 --> 01:15:45,851
wow,

2751
01:15:45,851 --> 01:15:46,930
I should give that a shot,

2752
01:15:46,931 --> 01:15:51,130
but I know I'm not made for being
hit I one head and I'm gone.

2753
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:52,780
It's not for everybody
and nothing's forever.

2754
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:53,440
Right.

2755
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,270
But what it really sounds like you want,

2756
01:15:55,271 --> 01:15:57,640
you want it to be for you because
you listen to and go like,

2757
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:58,931
oh my God.

2758
01:15:58,931 --> 01:15:59,141
Like,

2759
01:15:59,141 --> 01:16:04,141
could you imagine being zen with about
fighting about being there and not being

2760
01:16:05,201 --> 01:16:08,320
there in that ring about having to,

2761
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,970
having to zone out,

2762
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:14,110
but be very present so as
not to get fucking killed?

2763
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,130
Yeah,

2764
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:18,880
by choice and you have to learn how
to harness all of your potential,

2765
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:19,601
everything together,

2766
01:16:19,601 --> 01:16:20,351
psychological,

2767
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:20,951
physical.

2768
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,240
You got to tune it all together.

2769
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,940
You've got to make sure that your
mind doesn't overwhelm your body with

2770
01:16:24,941 --> 01:16:25,661
information.

2771
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:28,840
You've got to make sure that you keep
your heart rate steady and stay calm and

2772
01:16:28,841 --> 01:16:30,220
see things exactly as they are.

2773
01:16:30,221 --> 01:16:32,260
Not exaggerated because
you're under some adrenaline,

2774
01:16:32,261 --> 01:16:33,094
heightened fear.

2775
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,150
You've got to keep it together,

2776
01:16:34,151 --> 01:16:34,480
man,

2777
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:38,920
but what it really is is a vehicle for
developing your human potential martial

2778
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:39,880
arts or something.

2779
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,140
Anything that's really difficult,

2780
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:41,291
man.

2781
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:42,340
I think anything that's really,

2782
01:16:42,341 --> 01:16:42,611
really,

2783
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:44,410
really fucking hard to do in doing so,

2784
01:16:44,411 --> 01:16:47,500
you learn a lot about yourself while
you're doing it and you learn about your

2785
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:47,981
potential.

2786
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:49,630
You learn what you could
push yourself through.

2787
01:16:49,631 --> 01:16:51,520
You learn how much focus you have in you.

2788
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,930
You learn how to project it,

2789
01:16:52,931 --> 01:16:53,890
how to keep it strong,

2790
01:16:53,891 --> 01:16:54,730
had to keep it going,

2791
01:16:54,731 --> 01:16:55,510
had to stay,

2792
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:55,721
you know,

2793
01:16:55,721 --> 01:16:56,560
stay heightened,

2794
01:16:56,561 --> 01:16:57,610
stay in a heightened state.

2795
01:16:57,611 --> 01:16:58,361
And that's what you,

2796
01:16:58,361 --> 01:17:00,310
you get from that you learned excellence,

2797
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:00,761
you know,

2798
01:17:00,761 --> 01:17:01,241
for anything.

2799
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:04,570
Whether it's martial arts are fucking
playing a violin or anything when Shit's

2800
01:17:04,571 --> 01:17:05,830
really difficult to do.

2801
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:06,460
You,

2802
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,960
you learn something about yourself in it.

2803
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,390
Mastery of it leads to mastery
by the things in your master's.

2804
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:13,340
What was the quote you said?

2805
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:17,960
Once you understand the way broadly you
can see it in all things beautiful and

2806
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:21,260
especially from a bad motherfucker
chopping people up with a sword.

2807
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:21,561
Yeah.

2808
01:17:21,561 --> 01:17:23,230
I mean normally you get kind of that,

2809
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:26,070
that homespun wisdom from you know,

2810
01:17:26,071 --> 01:17:27,590
a little bald man who sits,

2811
01:17:27,591 --> 01:17:28,301
who's Chubby,

2812
01:17:28,301 --> 01:17:29,210
who sits on a hill.

2813
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:30,440
But this dude's like,

2814
01:17:30,441 --> 01:17:30,711
no,

2815
01:17:30,711 --> 01:17:31,220
I,

2816
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:36,220
I know a lot about life cause I ended
so fucking many of so sweetly slice of a

2817
01:17:38,361 --> 01:17:42,290
razor like sword across the knack and
wants the head separate from the body and

2818
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:47,000
like a fall down lovers kiss is body
twitches before it falls in a couple of

2819
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:50,310
spurts of blood come out of the blow
hole at the top and then it crumbles.

2820
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:51,983
Couple UNC,

2821
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:52,491
you're a,

2822
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:53,590
you're making things awkward.

2823
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,200
That's it.

2824
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,550
That's the end of the podcast folks.

2825
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,800
This is the longest podcast
in the history of podcasts.

2826
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,890
How long we going you really get
through all four hours if you really get

2827
01:18:00,891 --> 01:18:01,940
through it all ladies and gentlemen,

2828
01:18:01,941 --> 01:18:02,780
God bless you.

2829
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:04,460
You're beautiful iTunes,

2830
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:07,050
we're probably going to have to chop this
up into part one and part two is going

2831
01:18:07,051 --> 01:18:09,080
to take a walk because
I get that big of a fan.

2832
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,320
I don't want anybody her
while we do the show monitor.

2833
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:14,150
Like in terms of can you read feedback?

2834
01:18:14,151 --> 01:18:16,730
Do you have like we did that before
but it was always nigger cunt,

2835
01:18:16,731 --> 01:18:17,564
nigger con,

2836
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:18,360
uh,

2837
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:18,730
lesser.

2838
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:21,710
Whilst a lot of people just trying to
buy Twitter I use Twitter is awesome.

2839
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:21,891
Yeah,

2840
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:22,401
like Twitter,

2841
01:18:22,401 --> 01:18:22,670
I'll,

2842
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:24,300
I'll monitor while we do the show.

2843
01:18:24,301 --> 01:18:27,350
When there's a chat and
you want people like,

2844
01:18:27,351 --> 01:18:30,410
people want to like send you
something that you'll read.

2845
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,880
They'll just say the most obscene,

2846
01:18:31,881 --> 01:18:32,511
ridiculous,

2847
01:18:32,511 --> 01:18:33,410
retarded shit.

2848
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:36,500
So there was like a lot of people
doing that flooding things.

2849
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,790
I was wondering if anyone,

2850
01:18:37,791 --> 01:18:38,241
here we go,

2851
01:18:38,241 --> 01:18:41,570
just listen to Kevin Smith and
Joe Rogan mindblowing podcast.

2852
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:42,711
That's it.

2853
01:18:42,711 --> 01:18:44,410
Can I get my old song back man?

2854
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:45,260
No Dude,

2855
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:46,370
you gotta go with the,

2856
01:18:46,371 --> 01:18:47,750
with the eight bit versions.

2857
01:18:47,751 --> 01:18:48,584
No Way.

2858
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:50,070
The committee version,

2859
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:50,550
man,

2860
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:53,570
I want to make a version of the
last four minutes of free bird.

2861
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:54,643
Can we do that?

2862
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:56,800
Can we make that my new interviewee?

2863
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:58,410
I just want the last four minutes.

2864
01:18:58,940 --> 01:18:59,750
Just the last four.

2865
01:18:59,750 --> 01:18:59,930
Yeah.

2866
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:00,710
A free bird.

2867
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:01,760
Freebird Leonard's Kennard.

2868
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,450
Hmm.

2869
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:02,931
You know that,

2870
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:03,670
that

2871
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:05,750
[inaudible]

2872
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:09,100
and you know where the end comes.

2873
01:19:09,101 --> 01:19:09,934
I don't even have it on this.

2874
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:15,341
Ladies and gentlemen,

2875
01:19:15,341 --> 01:19:16,630
it's been an amazing podcast.

2876
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:17,351
I've had a great time.

2877
01:19:17,351 --> 01:19:18,400
If you're still alive out there,

2878
01:19:18,401 --> 01:19:19,001
if you're awake,

2879
01:19:19,001 --> 01:19:22,420
if you haven't listened to us and driven
your fucking car off the road and into

2880
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:25,060
the woods because we draw
dotted on for four hours.

2881
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:27,820
I'm sorry I had anybody out there.

2882
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,790
Anybody at all remember
that fucking day after.

2883
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:31,040
Yeah,

2884
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:31,721
and I was a kid.

2885
01:19:31,721 --> 01:19:32,260
They did this,

2886
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:37,260
this TV movie about nuclear work as we
were all afraid about dying nuclear war.

2887
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:37,691
Stop,

2888
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:38,440
drop and roll.

2889
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,011
Yes.

2890
01:19:39,011 --> 01:19:42,010
But they made this movie called the
day after on ABC and they were like,

2891
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,170
viewer discretion is advised.

2892
01:19:44,171 --> 01:19:48,010
Like when that deep voice guy came into
play first and they were telling you,

2893
01:19:48,011 --> 01:19:48,371
it was like,

2894
01:19:48,371 --> 01:19:49,091
this is intense.

2895
01:19:49,091 --> 01:19:50,080
This is no joke.

2896
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,430
This is what could happen if
America witnesses or feel,

2897
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:53,711
you know,

2898
01:19:53,711 --> 01:19:53,890
get,

2899
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:56,680
feels the effects of a nuclear attack.

2900
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:59,310
And they at one point there,

2901
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,610
you know on the microphone go,

2902
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,000
I'm like,

2903
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:01,330

2904
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:01,901
this is blah,

2905
01:20:01,901 --> 01:20:02,381
blah blah,

2906
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:03,011
wherever we are,

2907
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:04,420
Idaho's anybody out there.

2908
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:05,111
And then,

2909
01:20:05,111 --> 01:20:05,381
you know,

2910
01:20:05,381 --> 01:20:06,580
they wait for a response.

2911
01:20:06,581 --> 01:20:07,414
They'll fucking,

2912
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,130
this

2913
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:08,821
is Katie k,

2914
01:20:08,821 --> 01:20:09,031
blah,

2915
01:20:09,031 --> 01:20:09,421
blah blah.

2916
01:20:09,421 --> 01:20:09,840
And Idaho.

2917
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,040
Is anybody out there?

2918
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:12,540
Anybody at all?

2919
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:12,781
Oh,

2920
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:13,980
it was so haunting as a kid.

2921
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:14,251
I was like,

2922
01:20:14,251 --> 01:20:18,240
could you imagine there's only one to
like 12 people left in this fucking town

2923
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,190
and they're trying to reach
other people in the world.

2924
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:20,760
Name enough.

2925
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,650
Anybody's fucking left cause they
saw mushroom clouds and shit.

2926
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,400
I terrified me as a kid,

2927
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,420
but when you were just like,

2928
01:20:27,421 --> 01:20:29,070
if anybody's listening
and reminded me of that,

2929
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:30,150
like is anybody out there?

2930
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:34,260
I think it was John Lithgow who said
it to you pulled me back to lift gas

2931
01:20:34,261 --> 01:20:35,370
circuit and to bitch.

2932
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:37,770
That's how class you are
so kind of performer.

2933
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:38,310
You are.

2934
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:39,860
That's amazing folks.

2935
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,220
This has been an awesome time.

2936
01:20:41,221 --> 01:20:42,054
I had his grants.

2937
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:43,640
I'm honored.

2938
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:43,960
Thanks.

2939
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,180
I'm really honored to be your friend.

2940
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:45,711
It's cool.

2941
01:20:45,711 --> 01:20:45,980
It's fun.

2942
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:46,760
Likewise.

2943
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,110
Let's do it again anytime you want to do.

2944
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:49,830
I said,

2945
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:50,370
I said,

2946
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,001
but you're busy.

2947
01:20:51,001 --> 01:20:52,800
There's way too and you are.

2948
01:20:52,801 --> 01:20:54,390
You've got a thousand things going on,

2949
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,190
but I said last time you want,

2950
01:20:56,191 --> 01:20:57,120
when we were in my thing,

2951
01:20:57,121 --> 01:20:57,810
I said,

2952
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,700
I want to do a podcast
every week with Rogan,

2953
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:01,890
just called centered where we
just get stoned and they go.

2954
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,660
That's called the Joe Rogan experience.

2955
01:21:04,090 --> 01:21:04,891
That's what they do.

2956
01:21:04,891 --> 01:21:05,161
I was like,

2957
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:05,311
oh,

2958
01:21:05,311 --> 01:21:08,420
I didn't know where we could combine
our forces dude and I was going to help

2959
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,263
you.

2960
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:13,920
We'd legalize and half this country I
know may look like we're sure poster

2961
01:21:13,921 --> 01:21:17,160
children for stoners work.

2962
01:21:17,161 --> 01:21:17,994
We're productive.

2963
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:19,060
We're well at,

2964
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:19,330
you know,

2965
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:20,250
were well spoken.

2966
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:21,660
I'm about will edge and nice,

2967
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,370
well spoken and yeah,

2968
01:21:23,371 --> 01:21:24,061
we're nice people.

2969
01:21:24,061 --> 01:21:26,740
That's got it going on though too
because you're got the strength to,

2970
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:27,570
well that's the confusing.

2971
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:28,403
Protect us.

2972
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,580
Yes we need,

2973
01:21:29,581 --> 01:21:29,821
yeah.

2974
01:21:29,821 --> 01:21:30,211
We're like,

2975
01:21:30,211 --> 01:21:30,481
look,

2976
01:21:30,481 --> 01:21:31,051
he's smart,

2977
01:21:31,051 --> 01:21:33,330
but look at those guns
were okay behind him.

2978
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:34,590
I flipped the switch.

2979
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:35,990
It's confusing.

2980
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,260
I'm confusing people.

2981
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:38,320
All right,

2982
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:38,880
whatever.

2983
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,370
What are the fuck?

2984
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:40,360
Thank you very much for coming here.

2985
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,740
Back a great time.

2986
01:21:41,741 --> 01:21:42,910
It was awesome conversation.

2987
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:44,340
Thank you everybody for all,

2988
01:21:44,341 --> 01:21:44,621
all the,

2989
01:21:44,621 --> 01:21:45,460
all the love on,

2990
01:21:45,461 --> 01:21:48,310
on Twitter and on Facebook
and all that shit.

2991
01:21:48,311 --> 01:21:49,180
And I think,

2992
01:21:49,181 --> 01:21:49,481
you know,

2993
01:21:49,481 --> 01:21:50,900
we're in a rare era,

2994
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,160
rare time and this time is what
brought me and you together.

2995
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:54,490
Yeah.

2996
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:54,731
This,

2997
01:21:54,731 --> 01:21:57,370
this is crazy Internet we've
got going on here and uh,

2998
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:59,260
I think I'm very happy that it's all free.

2999
01:21:59,261 --> 01:22:01,750
We're going to keep it free forever
and don't ever worry about that.

3000
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:02,051
We'll,

3001
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:02,151
I'll,

3002
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:02,391
I'll,

3003
01:22:02,391 --> 01:22:03,370
I'll pay for bandwidth.

3004
01:22:03,371 --> 01:22:04,001
We'll figure it out.

3005
01:22:04,001 --> 01:22:05,230
This podcast,

3006
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:05,591
you know,

3007
01:22:05,591 --> 01:22:07,510
I think one of the best things
about your podcast as well,

3008
01:22:07,511 --> 01:22:08,070
it's free.

3009
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,903
Free.

3010
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:09,870
That's the model.

3011
01:22:09,871 --> 01:22:11,430
You got to get it free for everybody.

3012
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:12,840
They'll pay you back another way.

3013
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:13,411
Exactly.

3014
01:22:13,411 --> 01:22:14,130
Now the fine,

3015
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:15,540
but just don't get it up front.

3016
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,090
You'll get it on there.

3017
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:16,331
Yeah.

3018
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:16,541
You,

3019
01:22:16,541 --> 01:22:17,100
you,

3020
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,240
you earn either your place in their life,

3021
01:22:19,241 --> 01:22:21,370
you pay as you exited
the free little rascals

3022
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:22,431
that show.

3023
01:22:22,431 --> 01:22:23,061
And they were like,

3024
01:22:23,061 --> 01:22:23,331
you know,

3025
01:22:23,331 --> 01:22:25,160
don't pay pay as you exit.

3026
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,450
And they were all worried.

3027
01:22:26,451 --> 01:22:26,661
Like,

3028
01:22:26,661 --> 01:22:28,370
I think spanky was a god of your mind.

3029
01:22:28,371 --> 01:22:30,740
They're never going to
pay the of the show.

3030
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,150
As bad as the show was.

3031
01:22:32,151 --> 01:22:32,910
They all

3032
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:34,660
that's hippy Bohemian shit man.

3033
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:35,933
That's awesome.

3034
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:36,773
Thank you very much.

3035
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:38,660
[inaudible] thank you to the fleshlight.

3036
01:22:38,661 --> 01:22:40,170

toy from Matt and you'll come Holla at

3039

3040
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,820
And uh,

3041
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:55,440
I have some dates coming up but
I can't read my Twitter page.

3042
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:56,520
What is it?

3043
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,570
We got a Washington DC September
30th tickets just went on sale today.

3044
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:01,770
There was a of sale yesterday.

3045
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,260
The Warner theater that's good.

3046
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:06,040
Synagogue said goes a nice place.

3047
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,903
I like it.

3048
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:07,361
Awesome.

3049
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:07,541
Yeah,

3050
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:08,980
this is the sixth street synagogue,

3051
01:23:08,981 --> 01:23:09,730
I think it is.

3052
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:10,270
Oh yeah,

3053
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:11,620
it's literally a synagogue.

3054
01:23:11,621 --> 01:23:12,940
It's about 600 seater.

3055
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:13,530
Um,

3056
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:14,311
I did a show there,

3057
01:23:14,311 --> 01:23:14,831
a Q and a,

3058
01:23:14,831 --> 01:23:16,090
I think last time was in DC.

3059
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:16,301
It was,

3060
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:16,691
it was cool.

3061
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:17,051
We didn't,

3062
01:23:17,051 --> 01:23:18,460
that's not what we played red state.

3063
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:19,390
We played red state,

3064
01:23:19,391 --> 01:23:20,224
I believe at the,

3065
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,430
at the Warner,

3066
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:22,691
but we played,

3067
01:23:22,691 --> 01:23:24,580
I did a Q and a at the
synagogue is nice place.

3068
01:23:24,581 --> 01:23:25,070
Not you know,

3069
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:26,680
600 seats but it's pretty cool.

3070
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,251
Nice.

3071
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:27,820
Cool.

3072
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:30,730
And then a Houston Texas goes
on sale Tuesday salt at all.

3073
01:23:30,731 --> 01:23:31,960
You guys go where you going there?

3074
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:36,060
The Verizon Wireless Center
Centre motherfucker I'm going to,

3075
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:37,013

3076
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:37,460
I Dunno.

3077
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:38,440
It's a couple thousand.

3078
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:39,320
Oh fuck bro.

3079
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:41,470
Look at this guy pulling
out his fucking performance.

3080
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:42,280
What?

3081
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,100
I'm just kind of balling now.

3082
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:45,750
What um,

3083
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:46,570
uh,

3084
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:47,250
I,

3085
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:47,561
I,

3086
01:23:47,561 --> 01:23:47,891
you know,

3087
01:23:47,891 --> 01:23:48,471
I actually,

3088
01:23:48,471 --> 01:23:51,610
you should tell you that I started doing
Q and A's at the end of my show is one

3089
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:54,130
of the reasons cause I saw you doing
and I thought it looked cool as fuck on

3090
01:23:54,131 --> 01:23:57,250
isn't the ability just to let people
just walk up to you and ask questions.

3091
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:58,300
You know who I saw do it,

3092
01:23:59,240 --> 01:23:59,931
stayed with me,

3093
01:23:59,931 --> 01:24:00,681
my entire youth,

3094
01:24:00,681 --> 01:24:02,570
my grandmothers to watch
Carol Burnett show.

3095
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:04,940
And at the end of the show she'd
stand out there and do Q and A.

3096
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:07,940
Carol Burnett would do that at
the end of her show sketch show.

3097
01:24:07,941 --> 01:24:08,360
She did.

3098
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,470
I have not every episode,

3099
01:24:09,471 --> 01:24:10,180
but like,

3100
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:10,580
and you,

3101
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:11,570
when she did it,

3102
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:12,800
it was fun because like,

3103
01:24:12,801 --> 01:24:13,880
she was literally like,

3104
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:14,870
no masks,

3105
01:24:14,871 --> 01:24:16,550
no disguise is no costumes.

3106
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:18,310
She's literally came out on stage.

3107
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:19,940
I'm sitting there talking to
the audience and you know,

3108
01:24:19,941 --> 01:24:20,720
she'd tug her rear,

3109
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:21,770
say goodbye to her grandmother,

3110
01:24:21,771 --> 01:24:22,604
whatever that meant.

3111
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,900
But it was,

3112
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:24,470
I dunno,

3113
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:27,800
it was just informal casual and
she seemed so fucking quick.

3114
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:29,990
Like she always had a
great answer and stuff.

3115
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:33,830
And Shandling was on the show when Garry
Shandling was on our show a couple of

3116
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:34,130
weeks ago,

3117
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:36,470
he said that he was talking
to Carol Burnett about,

3118
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:37,191
uh,

3119
01:24:37,191 --> 01:24:38,210
about that show.

3120
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:39,290
And she said,

3121
01:24:39,291 --> 01:24:39,801
she goes,

3122
01:24:39,801 --> 01:24:40,330
um,

3123
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:40,481
to,

3124
01:24:40,481 --> 01:24:41,120
you know,

3125
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,440
do you know how that worked?

3126
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,710
We only used the funny questions.

3127
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:50,410
She whispered it to him like it was a
fucking leg of great recipe or something.

3128
01:24:50,411 --> 01:24:50,920
It was like,

3129
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:51,101
oh,

3130
01:24:51,101 --> 01:24:51,940
that's hilarious.

3131
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,150
But I liked,

3132
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:54,430
I always liked it as a kid.

3133
01:24:54,431 --> 01:24:54,581
Like,

3134
01:24:54,581 --> 01:24:56,230
that was my favorite part
of that show was like,

3135
01:24:56,231 --> 01:24:56,681
oh my gosh,

3136
01:24:56,681 --> 01:24:58,360
she's going to literally
talk to the audience,

3137
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:01,660
fill harm you to do that after every
a taping of Newsradio did he really?

3138
01:25:01,661 --> 01:25:01,990
Yeah,

3139
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:03,860
he would Q and a with the
audience and do it all the time.

3140
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:07,350
He would ask next time we do this and
we just got talking about farmers could

3141
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:08,260
even do stand up.

3142
01:25:08,330 --> 01:25:11,400
He would go out and do impressions
cause he had a crazy Clinton impression,

3143
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:12,701
you know,

3144
01:25:12,701 --> 01:25:13,001
uh,

3145
01:25:13,001 --> 01:25:13,834
you know,

3146
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:15,640
uh,

3147
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:18,910
I don't have a small pain is
Monica Lewinsky has a big mouth,

3148
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,610
a bunch of,

3149
01:25:20,611 --> 01:25:20,860
uh,

3150
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:23,080
like Clinton's should fill as Clinton.

3151
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:23,810
Thank you rob.

3152
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:24,011
And he,

3153
01:25:24,011 --> 01:25:24,281
he,

3154
01:25:24,281 --> 01:25:24,520
uh,

3155
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:27,580
he would go and do Q and a with the
audience when he was very sharp and very

3156
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:27,910
quick.

3157
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:28,201
And I,

3158
01:25:28,201 --> 01:25:29,140
I actually started,

3159
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:30,003
I never,

3160
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,540
for the first time with the first season,

3161
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:33,160
I never talked to the audience very much.

3162
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:34,210
I would say hi and whatever,

3163
01:25:34,211 --> 01:25:35,800
but I never would do
like stand up for him.

3164
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,190
Then after he started doing it,

3165
01:25:37,191 --> 01:25:37,571
I was like,

3166
01:25:37,571 --> 01:25:37,841
yeah,

3167
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:40,150
we could just fucking fuck
around and talk to the audience.

3168
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:42,990
So Andy would go up and do it
and I would do it and yeah,

3169
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,241
it was,

3170
01:25:43,241 --> 01:25:43,570
it was,

3171
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:44,101
it was a good time.

3172
01:25:44,101 --> 01:25:46,150
Just cause like a captive audience.

3173
01:25:46,151 --> 01:25:47,800
Be predisposed to like you.

3174
01:25:47,801 --> 01:25:48,310
Yeah.

3175
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,340
See why you're trained pros,

3176
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:51,070
that's what you do.

3177
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:51,850
And they like it.

3178
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:52,750
It's fun for them.

3179
01:25:52,751 --> 01:25:52,931
You know?

3180
01:25:52,931 --> 01:25:53,980
It's like all of a sudden this,

3181
01:25:53,981 --> 01:25:54,880
we've gone off the,

3182
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:55,061
uh,

3183
01:25:55,061 --> 01:25:57,550
the normal pattern of what's going to
happen here tonight and they're just

3184
01:25:57,551 --> 01:25:58,450
having a good time.

3185
01:25:58,451 --> 01:25:59,060
And yes,

3186
01:25:59,060 --> 01:25:59,893
fucking around.

3187
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:00,550
Dude.

3188
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:01,120
You're the shit.

3189
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:01,751
Thank you very much.

3190
01:26:01,751 --> 01:26:02,770
But I do this all the time.

3191
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,520
This is a new

3192
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:05,121
empire.

3193
01:26:05,121 --> 01:26:06,560
We're building together or something,

3194
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:07,131
but I ever blah,

3195
01:26:07,131 --> 01:26:07,700
blah blah,

3196
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,410
brick by brick weed.

3197
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,940
This is the end of this podcast.

3198
