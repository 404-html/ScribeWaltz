1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,890
Here we go.
Three,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,780
two,
one.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,780
And we're live.
Tony Hinchcliffe.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,510
Hello Jake.
The fucking snake.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,020
What do you know,
Joe?

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,750
You've never heard it before.
I've heard it a couple times.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,790
I've heard.
Hey Joe,

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,610
I heard you shot your old lady down 
times as well.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,600
There you go.
I got to tell you,

10
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:23,434
man,
I watched a documentary last night and 

11
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:26,050
it's fantastic.
Appreciate it.

12
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:26,943
It is.
If that thing doesn't bring tears to 

13
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:29,400
you,
uh,

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,580
you need to go to a doctor.
Yeah.

15
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,423
You're not human man.
No doubt that his Dallas is a fucking 

16
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:36,760
saint.
He really is hard headed,

17
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,960
you know?
Uh,

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,250
without it.
I'd never made it.

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,600
Yeah,
because I'm

20
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,030
junkies like to lie a lot,
you know,

21
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,390
and alcoholics do too.
But it was a tough,

22
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:49,270
tough road bed and he guided me through 
it.

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,520
He never gave up and I can never thank 
him enough for what he's done for me and

24
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,030
given me my life back and not only my 
life of my family,

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,000
I've got my kids back to her.
They're all digging me now.

26
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,203
I'm a great grandfather.
Would probably the best grandfather 

27
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,480
ever,
you know,

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,460
I'm just saying because it's true.
I'll picture anybody else.

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,130
The detailing of your recovery though,
in him taking you into the,

30
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,770
what does he call his house?
That house?

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,260
The Accountability House.
Accountability Crib.

32
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:20,801
Yeah.
Yeah.

33
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:23,230
I mean he's a special guy.

34
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,210
I understand.
I mean,

35
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,730
no man in his right mind would bring one
much less two drunks into their home.

36
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,640
You know,
you got to expect tragedy.

37
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,130
There's going to be something come back 
out of this.

38
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,890
And uh,
he was able to hold us together,

39
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:43,210
man.
And they were a couple of brief,

40
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,403
brief moments that does,
that kind of escalated and got kind of 

41
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:49,840
stupid.
But he wouldn't give up man.

42
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,870
Well I got to know Dallas when he came 
on the podcast and one,

43
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,980
one thing that you get about him as this
guy,

44
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,530
he,
he's not just about himself.

45
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,410
Like he is really about helping people 
out.

46
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,570
He gets a buzz out of helping people.
Yeah.

47
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,990
Which is to me is just so amazing and 
I've picked that up off of him.

48
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,950
I searched people out now in the crowd 
that have are having a hard time walking

49
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:15,120
or you see something going on or they're
overweight and you go and,

50
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,130
you know,
I'm so and so,

51
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,240
it gets me in the name Jake the snake.
I can talk to them.

52
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,523
Hey,
you ever thought about trying some DDP 

53
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:23,254
yoga man,
because it works and if you've never 

54
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:28,480
done it,
DDP Yoga is without a doubt.

55
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,500
The number one thing out there for 
getting healthy,

56
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,650
it makes your body healthy,
makes your mind healthy,

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,160
you know?
And uh,

58
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,360
for him to be out there,
he's just a soldier.

59
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,510
Yeah,
he really pushes all day long man.

60
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,670
And uh,
here's a guy that,

61
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:46,504
that,
that could be handling in a totally 

62
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:50,980
different way,
but he still picks up the phone and call

63
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:52,780
somebody and thanks them for buying the 
program.

64
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,720
Yeah.
Hell does that mean what does do that?

65
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,840
He does because he wants to know.
And the next thing you know,

66
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:03,250
he's on a 25 minute phone call and 
they're sending him photos of the before

67
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,590
picture and then he wants to look at an 
after picture.

68
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:08,170
You in six months from now,
the stories,

69
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,650
you've got a million of success stories.

70
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,170
We played a video when he was in a 
vagina man who was a paratrooper.

71
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,253
I could barely walk.
I mean he had done a bunch of paratroop 

72
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,350
missions,
you know,

73
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,180
parachuting out of planes and landing on
his knees.

74
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:24,740
His knees are destroyed,
legs destroyed,

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,640
back,
destroyed.

76
00:03:25,641 --> 00:03:30,290
Everything's fucked up,
but he starts out barely can stand,

77
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,150
barely can walk.
Two Kings,

78
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,880
two kings.
By the end of the video,

79
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,130
this guy's running,
he's running,

80
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,170
he's doing full yoga poses and it's 
these animal incremental steps,

81
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,330
incremental steps,
but he kept getting better,

82
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:45,950
kept getting better,
kept getting better,

83
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,113
and that is.
It's so symbolic of your journey in 

84
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:50,534
life.
If you just decided to give up and 

85
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:53,144
decide to just fuck the world,
I'm just going to just eat and drink 

86
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:58,820
myself until they live in.
You have been there.

87
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,654
You could talk.

88
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,070
Stay there a long time,
but then you turn it around.

89
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,911
But that's,
that's.

90
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,030
I fucking love that.
I love stories like that,

91
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,070
but it's a one in a million shot man.
Unless you have a diamond Dallas page in

92
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:12,904
your corner,
because it wasn't only about Dallas 

93
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,830
help,
it was the whole group,

94
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,190
right.
See Dallas,

95
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,073
you know,
he came up with the idea of him and 

96
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,500
Steve,
you as a business manager,

97
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,770
whatever.
And uh,

98
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,241
they said,
look,

99
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,074
here,
we're going to bring you back through 

100
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,790
this.
We want to film the whole thing.

101
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,683
I'm like,
I don't know about that because I got 

102
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:31,650
burned bad in film here while back,
you know,

103
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,870
and they just cut me a new one.
Man,

104
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,310
they lied to me and didn't.
But anyway,

105
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,720
it happens.
Film,

106
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,970
this whole thing and it's the end of it.
If we put it together and you don't like

107
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:42,804
it will never go out.

108
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,690
Really.
You're gonna get me that,

109
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:47,524
right?
You're going to invest this money and 

110
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:51,070
this time,
because we,

111
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,993
I stayed there for three and a half 
years because it took me that long to 

112
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:56,230
get clean.
That's amazing.

113
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,150
You know,
I couldn't go in for six months.

114
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:00,040
I've done that.
I get them going for four months.

115
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,040
I've done that.
Held the time I went in for four months.

116
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,874
Man.
I go across the stage and get my 

117
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,640
diploma,
so to speak,

118
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,900
from finishing this course,
being in Rehab for four months,

119
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,260
I go out the other side,
pickup a payphone and call my dealer.

120
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:19,180
He meets me outside and the doorman with
a big rock in a stem.

121
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,740
Thank you.
I made it,

122
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,370
but that's the insanity of the disease.
The disease.

123
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:28,030
We'll let you sit in a place for three 
or four months and not touch you.

124
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,010
What are you even come knocking on your 
door?

125
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,800
Because it knows right now you're locked
into your own to do this,

126
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,230
but it's open.
They're doing pushups in the corner,

127
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:36,060
man.
Waiting on her.

128
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,893
As soon as you get away from these 
idiots over here teaching you bad 

129
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,304
habits,
Jake,

130
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,173
uh,
I'm going to get you where you need to 

131
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:45,214
be.
And that was the thing of being there 

132
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,004
for that long period of time.
What was the feeling like when you did 

133
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:53,290
slip up?
Because a couple of times,

134
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,380
four or five times I did,
it was horrible.

135
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,410
I wanted to die because not only did I 
feel like I let myself down,

136
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,553
lay him down and that really sucked 
because here's a guy is opened up his 

137
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,280
wallet incident.
You come live with me.

138
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,310
Don't worry about your damn bills.
I'll take care of them.

139
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,200
Excuse me.
Oh Damn.

140
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:15,651
Damn.
Sure.

141
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:16,540
In that,
you know,

142
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,800
you don't have to talk to me about this.
Scrabble.

143
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:19,900
Yeah.
I'm moving in with your brother.

144
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:21,290
If you go pay all my bills,
man,

145
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,124
when I get healthy,
but I never found was going to take 

146
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,880
three years.
Wow.

147
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,990
Let's see.
He would take,

148
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,873
you know,
if he had to go do a con or go do some 

149
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,240
music,
go to go to a movie or something.

150
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,430
He had people that worked for DDP Yoga,
specifically Garrett,

151
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,520
and I'm a young kid named Dylan,
who I really got the kid messed up,

152
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,590
you know,
because he had to share a room with me.

153
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,450
I don't wear clothes.

154
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,770
Okay.
What kind of freaky?

155
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,060
Here's this old wrestler that I idolized
for years and I'm seen as junk.

156
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,620
All gray hair and everything.
Seeing the snake and the bat,

157
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,980
I accidentally bent over picking 
something up right there by his bed.

158
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,410
I had no idea my son was in his mouth.
But uh,

159
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,061
yeah,
Dylan,

160
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,550
he lived through some horrible things 
and Gary did too,

161
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,413
but

162
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,430
Dallas always made sure I've taken care 
of,

163
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,470
you know,
he,

164
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,180
whatever he had to do the first thing 
you have to do to take care of Jake.

165
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,430
And he put me first.
I didn't expect that we would.

166
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,550
The solidarity and the comradery that 
you guys all have an razor Ramon as well

167
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,470
when you guys were all in on the house 
together,

168
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:32,304
like the experiences that you guys 
shared working together and then still 

169
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,410
in life,
you know,

170
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:39,930
you guys have a bond that's very,
very.

171
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,120
It's very hard for most people.

172
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,143
Yeah.
They can't get it.

173
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,120
It's like guys that are in the service 
together,

174
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,153
there's just something that becomes.
They become brothers in one and with 

175
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,121
Dallas,
you know,

176
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:55,240
the thing about him was he's never went 
down that addiction,

177
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,290
that addiction road.
He used to run nightclubs,

178
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,990
but he never became an alcoholic.
He's a freak.

179
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,130
Piss on him.
Screw him.

180
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,860
He got a better car than I did.
Okay.

181
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,400
I get that,
but I liked my cars.

182
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,040
No,
ma'am.

183
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,873
My cards now are awesome.
My life is so good to go from hell 

184
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,320
because that's where I was at,
man.

185
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:22,321
You have no idea what it's like to wake 
up and be angry that you woke up.

186
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,100
You didn't want to.
You want.

187
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:29,110
You want it to be over and there's been 
so many years were like that for me that

188
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,440
I wouldn't go out shopping.
Lists was 3:00

189
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,273
AM,
so I didn't want anybody to see me 

190
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,370
because I had gotten to the point.

191
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,150
I hated myself so much.
I'm begging God to die.

192
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,853
When I would hear another wrestler died,
I'd get angry at God and curse him for 

193
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,060
not taking me.
Instead,

194
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,193
when Piper died,
we were just talking about rodey before 

195
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,010
art.
Man.

196
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:55,650
I was so pissed off that he got to go 
before I did and that's wrong,

197
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:56,730
man.
I mean,

198
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,000
even when I tried to Odi a couple of 
times,

199
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,470
young really tried.
I took 100 value.

200
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,380
She's a surgeon,
milligram volume.

201
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,753
Woke up it.
All I've done is puke on my shelf and I 

202
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:10,290
said,
what a fucking loser you are.

203
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,430
You can even die,
right?

204
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,264
You're a piece of shit.
What kind of mindsets that mine is the 

205
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:19,500
torture that people put themselves 
through,

206
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,340
that people get the wrong idea about the
shit man.

207
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:24,210
They think,
yeah,

208
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,470
their elbow,
they're getting fucked up,

209
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:26,280
man.
They're happy.

210
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,113
No,
we're not.

211
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,520
No,
we're not happy.

212
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,713
We're not enjoying getting high.
I could enjoy and getting high 30 years 

213
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:35,604
ago,
but the problem was I couldn't live 

214
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,530
without it.
I mean,

215
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:42,420
I would feel like my heart was going to 
burst.

216
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,560
I couldn't breathe.
I was scared to go anywhere.

217
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,400
She was it,
everything or anything.

218
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,660
Like what,
what,

219
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,580
what was drawn?
What was pulling you?

220
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,710
What drug or what happened and what was 
it?

221
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,030
Booze.
It for me,

222
00:09:57,031 --> 00:10:00,350
it was more everything.
I,

223
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,580
I'm lucky I didn't get to in the heroin,
you know,

224
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,990
I probably wouldn't have beat that one,
but uh,

225
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,650
yeah I would because that's,
this is what I'm meant to be doing right

226
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:12,640
now.
But to go through 25,

227
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,500
30 years of doing cocaine,
that's amazing.

228
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,533
You know,
I think Vince Mcmahon for affording me 

229
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,680
my addiction because without it I'd be 
in prison somewhere because I would have

230
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:27,830
killed somebody for my drug.
No,

231
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,210
without a doubt.
I would have knifed and whatever.

232
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:31,930
Man.
You guys got a ball.

233
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,730
What's this done?
Life meant nothing to me,

234
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:36,564
man.
It gets to a point where you put 

235
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,260
yourself in such a dark hole.

236
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,050
There is no lie.
None at all,

237
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,230
and it takes somebody special.
You couldn't have sent me to rehab right

238
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:54,820
then.
I'd have been out in in minutes.

239
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,803
Even when Dallas offered me a job to pay
the whole trip and you'll move in with 

240
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,210
them.
We'll feed you the best damn food on the

241
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:02,710
planet.
We're going to get you healthy.

242
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:04,570
We're going to get the bullshit out of 
your system.

243
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:05,831
I'm like,
yeah,

244
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,251
yeah,
yeah.

245
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:10,510
I'm going to last about a week because I
knew me and I'm like,

246
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,590
dude,
if I'm making it a week,

247
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:12,424
I'm going to be doing good because at 
the time I couldn't do 24 hours not 

248
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,620
doing cocaine.
Wow.

249
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,110
If you wanted me to get up out of bed,
pray me some go.

250
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:22,090
Okay,
wow,

251
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,750
that's where I was at because life was 
too ugly

252
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,510
to want to go out there.
When did it start?

253
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,710
Did it start when you pro wrestling 
career started or before then?

254
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,820
Uh,
no.

255
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,823
Uh,
the cocaine and alcohol alcohol was 

256
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:38,900
always.
I mean,

257
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:42,940
I started drinking when I was 11 or 12.
Whoa.

258
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,943
My uh,
grandfather was an alcoholic drug slash 

259
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,870
drug addict because it started with an 
oilfield accident.

260
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,260
He got his legs crushed and uh,
he refused his legs cut off.

261
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,930
So he stayed in the hospital for 18 
months.

262
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,030
Well,
back in the 19 twenties,

263
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,470
the way that they fixed you let it heal 
then rebreak it,

264
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,600
you know,
that's what they did.

265
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,870
They didn't put bars and metal in there 
to straighten it out.

266
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,720
They'd let it heal and they'd break in a
different way.

267
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,640
Oh.
And they kept him,

268
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,580
kept him on morphine for a year and a 
half.

269
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,040
Was the end of the year and half.
They patted him on the back.

270
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,670
See you.
He had little itch going out there,

271
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:27,850
didn't he could.
So he could walk.

272
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,430
So it worked.
But it took you a hooked up on morphine.

273
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,573
Which back then,
it wasn't like today you can get on any 

274
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:36,470
corner.
Right.

275
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,000
He went to alcohol.
I remember in the sixties,

276
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:40,834
which is 40 years later.
They not trusting him to come to the 

277
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:47,110
doctor's office.
Will,

278
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:49,750
they didn't trust him to take the pill,
the pill,

279
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,430
the pill being a.
Oh my God.

280
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,800
What's it called?
Keep you from drinking.

281
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:57,060
Um,
and abuse,

282
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,670
you know,
he'd taken an abuse bill.

283
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,380
You're not going to drink it,
but it's a pita.

284
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,983
I mean,
I've drank on an abuse when it's been 

285
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,123
two days since I'd had the pill and I 
have a drink whether you have no idea 

286
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,293
how scary that shit is because 
immediately you start throwing up and 

287
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:21,280
you start pissing and shitting your 
pants.

288
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,613
It happens that quick and then you have 
to start with the sweats and all this 

289
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:27,580
and you'll wind up on the floor during 
the Heebie jeebies man,

290
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,103
that sounds strong and abuse as well.
They didn't even trust him to take the 

291
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:33,130
pill.
They said,

292
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:33,750
no,
no.

293
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,840
You take a taxi to the doctor's office 
and we'll give you a shot.

294
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,360
Who We know you're not going to take 
that pill.

295
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,523
So He'd do that every morning and he'd 
go outside and get in the same taxi and 

296
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:50,920
because we lived in a dry county,
he would take that same taxi over to the

297
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:54,930
next county and get a fifth of whiskey 
train,

298
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,813
get before he got home.
Now the rest of his day spent shitting 

299
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,770
and puking.
Wow.

300
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,800
But yet tomorrow he gonna do the same 
thing.

301
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,940
Oh my God.
That's the hell you know.

302
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,370
I was doing the.
You're doing the coke and stuff,

303
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:12,204
man.
I'm hating myself the whole time I do 

304
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:17,040
it.
I'm not getting high anymore and I can't

305
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,963
put it down.
I can't turn away from it because 

306
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:24,510
there's hope in that.
What's the hope for no more pain?

307
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,490
So just that it numbs more shame.
Shame.

308
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,620
Shame is something you put on yourself.
You know you can't shame me,

309
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,880
man.
I have to do it myself.

310
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,063
The man who was their man in,
because I'd went through some ugly shit 

311
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,630
as a kid.
Being sexually molested,

312
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,820
my sister,
being molested too,

313
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:54,530
and then my sister and murdered and we 
got all these things thrown in there and

314
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:57,020
I was hating myself because I didn't 
protect my sister better.

315
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,770
Um,
you know,

316
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,440
life happens.
What you do with it.

317
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,540
That's one of the things that Dallas 
preaches,

318
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,374
you know,
is about.

319
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,900
He got all this stuff out there,
man.

320
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:11,990
It's going to come at you.
I just want you to do with accounts.

321
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,140
You don't deflect it.
No,

322
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,810
you bring it to you,
you chew it up,

323
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,130
you spit it out,
swept,

324
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,103
sift through the bullshit and you go on 
is something I couldn't do because they 

325
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:28,220
got personal with me and I would lock 
down.

326
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,490
I'd shut up because that's how I handle 
things.

327
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,640
I just didn't talk about it.

328
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,310
When you've been sexually molested,
there is no good moment and that screwed

329
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:42,860
my head up and it still messes with my 
head.

330
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,683
I desperately,
desperately want to have a relationship 

331
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:51,800
with a woman.
No true relationship.

332
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:57,200
Finally,
it's 63 because I did have relationships

333
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:58,034
before that I was constantly sabotaging 
them because I didn't trust women with 

334
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:04,460
those.
The last one,

335
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,613
he raped me and beat me and threatened 
me and told me that my dad killed me 

336
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:10,934
because you know,
my dad was seven foot and weighed 425 

337
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:17,570
pounds so he could get the job done.
I just wanted my dad to be proud of me.

338
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:18,404
So all these things are a factor now.
Quiet while the wife beats me and made 

339
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,120
me do her and then beats me afterwards.
Dude,

340
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,900
sex and sex.
If you're doing it like that,

341
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:31,340
the coal rape and that Shit's screws 
your head up for life.

342
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,090
Now what do you do with it?
Well is a kid.

343
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,680
I hid that shit,
man.

344
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,860
I stuffed it away.
I didn't talk about that.

345
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:40,694
Are you kidding me?
When do you remember the first time 

346
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:44,920
talking about it to a high school buddy 
of mine?

347
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,640
He says,
you're so fucking lucky.

348
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,170
Manual.
Your stepmother still fucking hot.

349
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,073
She was.
She's 22 years old because my father is 

350
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:56,120
a child molester for Christ's sake.
Of course she was on,

351
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,890
but it wasn't hot to me because that's 
my mom know.

352
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,863
And then the bds afterwards.
That's fucking confused as you got all 

353
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:08,540
this shit going,
man.

354
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,230
So you start looking for a way out.
And for me as a kid,

355
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,513
my grandfather would get drunk and 
forget where he hit his liquor because 

356
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,640
he had to hide it from her grandmother 
because she knew what he was.

357
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,770
She had dealt with it for 50 years.

358
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,610
So every time she found a bottle on the 
farm she'd break it.

359
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,950
And that's it.
So he would hide it.

360
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,971
Chicken,
my house,

361
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:29,804
different places.
Well me and my buddies from girls 

362
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,140
straight with go out and find it.
Get 12 years old,

363
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:36,974
11 years old.
Then we got smart and started selling 

364
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:42,110
into the other neighborhood kids and 
make a buck.

365
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,340
That was my beginning of the drink man.
And uh,

366
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,050
you know,
as time goes on,

367
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:53,051
man,
you start smoking weed in the pills.

368
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,450
What else is next?
Because I'm still not forgetting.

369
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,913
I'm still remembering this shit.
And you go out and you try to have a 

370
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:03,264
good time with people and then you 
realize something's different than you 

371
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,740
because drugs it put you to sleep.
Wake me up,

372
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,680
you know,
downers.

373
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,630
Wake me up,
the council,

374
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,090
I wired,
he gave me five Percocet,

375
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:21,924
brother,
I'll drink a case of beer and dance all 

376
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:25,044
night for you.

377
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,820
Really go out and have three or four 
wrestling matches.

378
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,500
Let's go to the.
If I tell you

379
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:35,290
when I've messed my neck up and 89 when 
he was a guitar,

380
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,540
when I wanted to go to the gym,
my regimen was to wake up,

381
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,520
go downstairs,
starts coffeemaker.

382
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,990
Take two men,
10 milligram percocet them in my mouth,

383
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:51,130
chew them up and wash them down with 
coffee and hit the gym.

384
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,060
Jesus.
I loved it because I was on fire man.

385
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,670
Plus the percocet made me a little 
gnarly.

386
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,010
Made me want to punch in.
Really?

387
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,280
So you get a good workout in anything 
good from percosets.

388
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,430
That's how screwed up my wiring is.
That is.

389
00:19:06,431 --> 00:19:09,280
So you talked to any drug and they'll 
tell you their wiring.

390
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,950
Yeah,
things that make you go to sleep.

391
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,250
Wake me up.
Things that wake you up but me to sleep.

392
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,160
So the,
the pain of pro wrestling,

393
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,023
which is probably one of the most brutal
professions and the person can embark 

394
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:25,870
and write and think about all the days 
that you were on the road,

395
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,910
all the many,
many matches,

396
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,120
all that physical pain probably 
justified the drugs even more.

397
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,110
I didn't even care.
He didn't care about the fact.

398
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,390
I don't.
I felt no pain.

399
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:45,130
I wrestled none afterwards.
No.

400
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,470
I was wrestling in a guy in Louisiana,
Ernie the cat lad,

401
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,460
you remember him playing for the Afl San
Diego chargers.

402
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,070
He's in the hall of fame football and 
wrestling.

403
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,030
60 nine slash three slash 50 bad ass son
of a bitch,

404
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:01,541
man,
you know,

405
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,374
but back then they had chopped box and 
he had like 15 knee surgeries and that 

406
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:05,794
was in his career.
But we were wrestling and my bone came 

407
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:13,240
out of my arm compound fracture and he 
goes,

408
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,800
kid you're arm.
I'm like,

409
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,420
yeah,
I see it.

410
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,400
It's gone.
And he's like,

411
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,720
get away from me and I,
I'm trying to get to him.

412
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,250
And he started puking on me.

413
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,410
I'm like,
motherfucker,

414
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,510
you're puking on me.
Your arm and your arm is fucking bomb.

415
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Dude.
Finished the match.

416
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,460
Fuck you.
I'm getting out of the way,

417
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,410
man.
He could pick up a bunch of shit.

418
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:46,110
You finish off your opponent by having 
them nasty smelling shit to.

419
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,310
But I was fine.

420
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,100
I got back in it.
No,

421
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,120
I was sitting there and I was always 
saying,

422
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,280
this is a strange thing.
Not a blow on the bone.

423
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,680
It feels cold.
My blown that bowl.

424
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,850
Oh Wow.
Whoa.

425
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,540
Fifteen minutes later I'm in the car.
Holy Fuck.

426
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,730
But you felt it.
The adrenaline's gone.

427
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,250
You've been in the ring and he knew what
this light's.

428
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,020
Adrenaline's going.
Nothing hurts.

429
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,520
It feels good.
In fact,

430
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,010
you know what?
I would've thought that he would look at

431
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:15,821
the bone and go,
Ooh,

432
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:17,680
I've got to handle this.
Now.

433
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,080
Did you wrestle fucked up?
No.

434
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,193
Wrestled,
struggled,

435
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:26,450
straight bird know I've been going 
through a withdrawals at the time.

436
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,780
But uh,
no I didn't drinker either before,

437
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:33,230
before match.
And I didn't like it,

438
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:38,231
but I did it that way because it's my 
and my thing is another wrestler to take

439
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:44,174
care of my opponent.

440
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,973
I noticed that after a,
if I have like a fun set or something 

441
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:50,934
like that,
doing standup comedy that I like to 

442
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:53,790
have,
like if it went,

443
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,030
if I tried something new and it will win
extra good,

444
00:21:57,031 --> 00:21:59,520
I like to have an extra drink or two 
that night.

445
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:01,500
Would it be like that for you in 
wrestling?

446
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:04,930
Would you get more messed up?
It was like Madison Square Garden or

447
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,730
no,
I just went to sleep.

448
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,683
Go sleep was such a premium back then 
back in my day we were wrestling seven 

449
00:22:14,121 --> 00:22:15,950
days a week,
seven days a week.

450
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:19,160
Well except for Saturday and Sunday.
Then we wrestled twice on Saturday.

451
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:20,680
Twice on Sunday.
Jesus,

452
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:23,540
like you might do the La Coliseum,
2:00

453
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,340
in a rental car and drive to San Diego.
Seen Wow.

454
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,770
The next day you might be in Omaha at 
2:00

455
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,860
and then you'd be in Des Moines at 7:00.
Now you're driving all this in between.

456
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,720
You could fly.
You drive.

457
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,853
Well,
with me it made it even worse because I 

458
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:40,340
got to drag that fucking snake 
everywhere.

459
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,210
80 pound box of shit.
Be like currently.

460
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,970
Carry this around with a bad back over 
there.

461
00:22:46,971 --> 00:22:48,620
Hey folks out there.
Pray for him.

462
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:50,030
Man.
He's over there.

463
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,840
Who and moving back here.
He's making fun of young Jamie and Jamie

464
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,200
as a minor and it's very difficult to 
talk about injuries when you around

465
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,060
snake.
I want to bring it up.

466
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,980
Totally threw me under the bus.
Told me before when I first got here was

467
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:04,814
like I pulled my back the other day but 
I don't want to mention it in front of 

468
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:08,760
Jake.
The snake because it's embarrassing.

469
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Should be embarrassed.
Torres,

470
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:12,991
Torres,
man.

471
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:16,800
Giant tortoise band giant.
It was horrible.

472
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,053
Jamie's a good man.
I will not stand here while he 

473
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:20,354
disparaged him.

474
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,860
Shelby's though,
isn't it

475
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,140
dealt the snake did.
Was a snake a problem when you would get

476
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:29,930
on planes and ships them?
Twenty four slash seven.

477
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,650
Could you keep it secret or would they 
let you on the plane with it?

478
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,360
Oh,
I never said anything to anybody.

479
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,790
It just brought it up.
No,

480
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,800
I just put it in a trunk.
A little blanket around the bag and then

481
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:42,820
locked the truck.

482
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,500
You carry it on or what you check?
Check it.

483
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,580
Wow.

484
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,980
Poor fuck.
It's like,

485
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,400
why is it so cold in here?
Forty thousand feet off the ground.

486
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,620
You goddamn noise.
The snake,

487
00:23:56,621 --> 00:23:57,454
man.

488
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,560
You laugh about it.
It's like,

489
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,023
wait a minute,
I'll get a trade the snake out after 10 

490
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:03,221
days.
Yeah,

491
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:04,180
they can't take it.
I'm like,

492
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,163
really?
So a fucking snake can't live through 

493
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:09,004
the fucking scheduling,
but yet I'm asked to do 90 fucking days 

494
00:24:12,371 --> 00:24:14,380
straight.
So you have different snakes?

495
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

496
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,933
About every 10 days,
which used to be funny because people 

497
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:19,940
say she brang Damien.
Like if you notice it Damien,

498
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:20,840
some weeks it's five years,

499
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,720
put middle.
It's not shrinkage honey.

500
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,280
So your seven days a week would go on 
for the whole year.

501
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,820
Damn.
They just worked.

502
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:33,654
You know,
we,

503
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,493
I wrestled steamboat nine 93 days 
straight and about three days in I had 

504
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:42,924
to call my wife and her come take me 
around because I'd gotten dumbed out to 

505
00:24:47,491 --> 00:24:50,550
the point that I couldn't think.
So I'd get to the airport,

506
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,623
know that they want tickets,
but I have no idea where they're at and 

507
00:24:54,901 --> 00:24:57,510
I can't read anymore.
I'd look at stuff to read,

508
00:24:57,511 --> 00:24:59,520
but it just wouldn't.
It wouldn't work.

509
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,700
So I just ended up making fucking 
exhaustion.

510
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,420
Wow.
Exhaustion.

511
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,620
You just get so beat up,
man.

512
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:10,590
Your body's hurting so bad.
People say steroids,

513
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:11,424
man.
We were taking steroids just to try to 

514
00:25:12,451 --> 00:25:13,284
get healthy to heal.
And that's what the shit was invented 

515
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,810
for recovery.
You know that they invented in World War

516
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,643
Two,
believes what the story was for the 

517
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,223
prisoners of war because they didn't 
want the American soldiers to come home 

518
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,200
looking like they did.

519
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,873
So they put them on slow fucking boats 
and fed them for three months and guys 

520
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:38,190
put on 30,
40 pounds.

521
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,680
They say there would have been another 
war.

522
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:41,923
They'd have brought those troops home 
coming from concentration camps for the 

523
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:49,080
Germans or the Japanese and we'd have 
seen the way they were.

524
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,210
And of course now that you can see some 
of those old films of the way the Jews,

525
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,310
they were being slaughtered and 
everything.

526
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:59,730
And a bag of bones was.
It did.

527
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:01,080
They didn't want to bring those troops 
home.

528
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:04,230
So they invented steroids and started 
popping everybody when that shit.

529
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,850
Wow.
And bring them back.

530
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,600
But we did it really just to try to tee.
Was it hard to get them right?

531
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,900
Yeah.
Right.

532
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,190
Well did they help you get them?
You know,

533
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,790
they say they helped me,
but

534
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:26,380
I will tell you there as he just said 
enough already would

535
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:32,010
do is we would get booked and Hershey,
Pennsylvania.

536
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,620
Now when somebody told me this story 
first and like this is an old wives tale

537
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,870
because shit like that don't really 
happen.

538
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,053
You get to get downtown Hershey,
you go to the locker room all of a 

539
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,550
sudden.
So much.

540
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,340
Or they need to see you in locker room 
three.

541
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,163
That I do not go in there.
And there's this doctor there and he's 

542
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:58,920
got suitcases over here.
Boxes here.

543
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:00,450
Suitcases here.
Boxes there.

544
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,403
What do you need?
Good.

545
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,080
Excuse me.
What do you need up down?

546
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,450
What are you asleep?
Those are good.

547
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:10,650
I'll take.
How many can I get?

548
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,280
$300.
Got It right here.

549
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,320
Wow.
Steroids?

550
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,460
Yeah.
Absolutely.

551
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,720
What do you got?
I'll take that.

552
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:22,850
I'll take that.
And he was a grocery shopping and uh,

553
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,130
it used to be funny because the guys 
went all,

554
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:30,900
Hey Jacob going to carry my shit for me 
who will be going on in Canada?

555
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:31,920
And I'm like,
sure,

556
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,750
it's going to cost you a percentage of 
your shit.

557
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:35,723
Give me 10 percent of what you got.
I'll carry it across the border for he 

558
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,680
is Christ.
So Israel the dice.

559
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,730
I got eight or 10 guys.
I'm getting all their shit.

560
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,890
Where am I hiding in the snake bag for 
crying out loud.

561
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,630
Of course you put that in the bottom of 
the snow and that bag.

562
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,480
No.
And you get over there and they go,

563
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,280
we need to check the back of their 
brother.

564
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,380
I'm gonna.
Tell you right now I'm moving back,

565
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,400
moving back for it.

566
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,233
Because that motherfucker is pissed.
He hasn't eaten in three weeks and he's 

567
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,820
a little army.
Well,

568
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,780
if he does buy,
she went well.

569
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,470
When he does bite,
you try to hold.

570
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:15,450
Still hold still yet because if you jerk
is going to rip your flesh,

571
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,420
which is true.
If they tell you,

572
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:19,700
if a snake bites you,
whatever you do,

573
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,450
don't jerk away.
Excuse me,

574
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,480
sir.
Your rottweilers chewing on my ass hole.

575
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,850
Please kindly remove him.
No,

576
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:29,710
you jerk and you fight to get away.
Did you?

577
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,920
You use different kinds of snakes too 
though,

578
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:32,321
right?
Yeah.

579
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:33,840
Yeah.
I use pythons and cobras.

580
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,220
When you use the Colbert,
did you?

581
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,660
They defang them?
Yeah.

582
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,810
Dammit.
Had minimize them.

583
00:28:38,811 --> 00:28:40,660
I didn't define them date,
so they had.

584
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,270
They don't have things.
Oh,

585
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,850
by the Cobra.
Cobra is don't have things.

586
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:46,440
They have teeth.
Oh really?

587
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,060
Yeah,
it really sucks.

588
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,030
So they bite you no matter what.
It's like to him it's like chewing a,

589
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,113
you know,
have you ever fished and got a cat that 

590
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,400
you're send me.
Fill the spiny mouth.

591
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,683
That's what their bite felt like,
but it doesn't matter what it feels 

592
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:03,060
like.
It's what it looks like.

593
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,220
There's a over there

594
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,263
and the viewers don't know that at all.
Especially when you're a little boy 

595
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,343
watching it.
I mean the Saturday morning that you 

596
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,813
selected it on macho man,
Randy Savage affected an entire 

597
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:19,320
generation nut I've ever got.
I.

598
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:20,220
Oh,
there's no doubt.

599
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:23,910
I mean,
it affected me so deeply as a kid.

600
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,063
If I'm ever laying around with a girl 
and I'm having a little problem in the 

601
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:29,060
woods,
key department,

602
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,970
it happens at 63 a.
You put that on,

603
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,400
you know,
and uh,

604
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,130
I put the video on it instantly.
I'm kidding.

605
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,360
Really?
Oh brother,

606
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,000
that's your hardest man.
Why?

607
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,080
Holy Shit.
Watch me.

608
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,900
Watch.
That was.

609
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,103
This was literally the ultimate bad guy 
putting a snake on a good guy and look 

610
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:51,910
at the.
Look on that kid's face in the corner.

611
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,940
That park jumped up,
finger up his ass or that kid is gonna.

612
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,503
Have a goddamn heart attack,
but you have a heart rate monitor on 

613
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:04,390
him.
One hundred 80 beats per minute.

614
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,760
I had a conversation with one of my good
friends,

615
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:07,690
Pete.
You know Pete,

616
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,730
when he saw this,
you have a good friend,

617
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,520
but quick question I want to ask you,
but check out.

618
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,760
This is the kind of quality friend.
I have a dealer.

619
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,360
When he saw this,
when I,

620
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,880
when he saw this as a kid,
all on the same day that I saw him,

621
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,330
he ran away from home.
It freaked him out so badly.

622
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:28,450
When you put this snake on my arm,
he packed it.

623
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,540
He didn't even have anywhere to go.
He ended up coming home later that night

624
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:36,040
after it got cold or Kid,
he packed a bag and just left.

625
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,630
How old was he?
Oh Geez.

626
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,270
Probably.
Probably,

627
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,270
probably I would guess,
you know,

628
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,390
11,
12,

629
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,373
something like that.

630
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,410
Kids.
You're raped that day because jake.

631
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,100
Right.
Okay.

632
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,933
Oh No.
Let me tell you the real story on this 

633
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,440
whole thing.
You want to hear this job?

634
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:58,010
Here's how it really went down.
I've been waiting 30 years ago.

635
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,123
I got the done with the python because 
that motherfucker tell you the truth is 

636
00:31:02,341 --> 00:31:03,570
killing me.
You know,

637
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,453
weight.
One hundred pounds and then he would 

638
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,540
bite me and then it would be 30,
40 stitches.

639
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,100
That was 37 stitches there on it.
Oh my God.

640
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:11,963
You got the vein.
Make actually committed suicide that 

641
00:31:16,231 --> 00:31:17,940
night.
Look at that shit.

642
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:18,933
It's cool,
isn't it?

643
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,343
I mean,
this was just handles it a better bite 

644
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,790
when you're doing a great job,
look at that thing.

645
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:31,624
Sinking it's fucking teeth into him and 
then at the end the little stream of 

646
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:36,310
blood comes through and that was the 
final.

647
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,880
Oh my gosh.
I'll try to get a blues.

648
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,600
I'm trying.
I couldn't get a moose.

649
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,990
Oh my gosh.
Struggling to get him off blood.

650
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,870
Finally I had to prize mouth open to get
him off.

651
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,150
And by the way,
this is one Saturday morning.

652
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:50,890
So it's this,
you flip the channel.

653
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:54,220
It's a little old school cartoons that 
weren't even like entertaining.

654
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,323
You know what I mean?
And then there's this chaos on another 

655
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,800
channel and it's so obviously real.
Oh yeah.

656
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,190
It's.
So obviously she's terrified of snakes.

657
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,580
Well,
if he wasn't before,

658
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,600
Piper pulled a gun on me one time over 
snake,

659
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,443
man.
Really?

660
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,743
What happened?
I snuck up behind him with a snake and 

661
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:14,510
he fucking heard me.
Jagan went,

662
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:14,790
yeah,
he,

663
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,960
you know what?
You're fucking doing.

664
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:16,794
Any job.
You don't even get a fucking pistol and 

665
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,230
polarized motherfucker.
I'll kill you.

666
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:20,681
I'm like,
okay,

667
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:21,400
Roddy.
Again,

668
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,850
when I get it,
I get guy was shaking their fears,

669
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,040
their store,
here's the store.

670
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,580
I'm in the locker room behaving myself.
In fact,

671
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,103
I believe I was cleaning the wash cloth,
black boards off and making it nice for 

672
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:40,214
everybody and

673
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,413

We're going to get down and do it.
Sounds great,

676
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:56,180
and it's like we're going to take care 
of business first.

677
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:02,170
What built the snake?
Has he been fixed or not fixed?

678
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,480
You mean poisonous?
He goes,

679
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,440
yeah,
that might be the fuck.

680
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,500
I'm like,
Randy,

681
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:13,760
of course he's been fixed.
He goes,

682
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,163
maybe as in maybe he has to.
Stranger things have happened in the 

683
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:24,700

Somebody wants to match your match.

694
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,660
Don't play no fucking games.

695
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:06,120
So I got to sneak out man.
I'm psychotic motherfucker.

696
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,610
Like any special place you want it to 
bite me like my deck and like,

697
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,150

698
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:15,140
I'm like,

699
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,470
So I got to cobra out and pull my pant 
leg up.

700
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:23,960
Shimmin m a little bit and stuck my leg 
up here and he fucking beat me three,

701
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,700
four seconds.
Let's go march.

702
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,211
It was like,
no,

703
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:28,530
don't fucking move.
Take no lecture.

704
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:33,570
Do,
don't fucking pit bull shit.

705
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:42,250
Just fucking sit there and want to see 
the boys go through your body and chewed

706
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,820
me filing.
After about 10 minutes,

707
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:48,500
she's like,
let me get.

708
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:49,940
You're going to be on camera.
Sorry.

709
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:53,660
I didn't fucking make you happy.
If I'd known you want me to die,

710
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,680
die easily.
You'll be tonight brother.

711
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,933
You fever once the snake lids below me 
bringing back may want you to begin 

712
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,370
because I want this idea to fucking 
bullshit.

713
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,910
Fucking beat money.
Yeah.

714
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:12,500
Can you dig it?
Dig It.

715
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:13,490
All right,
we're out of here.

716
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,400
Wow.
Motherfucker,

717
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:18,770
you wait.
Pissed man,

718
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,030
because it's one thing to get bit in the
heat of a moment.

719
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,753
But to sit there and fucking cold,
have to hike her fucking pant legs up 

720
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:30,580
and let a fucking snake chew on you to 
make a motherfucker happy.

721
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,460
Come on,
give me a break.

722
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,330
We're asking a lot.
So if all those people were there,

723
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,613
I wouldn't have felt anything.
Just sit there and like in the locker 

724
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:40,290
room,
cold,

725
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,900
really much pumping other.
So I remember during the match,

726
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,110
we do.
Imagine a time in the ropes,

727
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:51,430
get the snake out,
came,

728
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,720
let's make sure he's happy.
And so I turned my back to macho man.

729
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:58,350
He doesn't see me and I fucked paint.
Brush hell out of his fucking snake.

730
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:03,660
Man pounded that motherfucker yet met a 
second time.

731
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,613
He's fucking mouthful and brother and 
he's looking for anything to fucking 

732
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:10,110
bikers.
And I just went whoa.

733
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,093
And took him the macho man and he 
latched on and he's true and he's shown 

734
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:17,960
me how much you're doing a great job.
Just ready.

735
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,980
You look so believable.
Goddamn fucking nuts.

736
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,240
What did they do to the snake?
Remove this poison glands.

737
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,540
They moved the venom sex.
Yeah.

738
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,783
So there's no venom in its body damage.
They replaced it with fucking stuff for 

739
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,330
bullying plants,
man.

740
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:40,460
You know,
they say like silicone silicone.

741
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,930
Oh yeah.
Sailing time better too.

742
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,100
So,
uh,

743
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:44,943
they just cut them out.
It's just like an operation or cut them 

744
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:48,900
out and fill them with silicone manager.
They can't regrow them.

745
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,540
Oh Wow.
Wow.

746
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,590
So they can't,
otherwise it would regrown yeah.

747
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,750
Creepy fucking animal.
Huh?

748
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,080
Frightening.
Especially as a kid.

749
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,180
And that did shoot you guys up at big 
law apple.

750
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,013
They did.
And I couldn't imagine what we talk 

751
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,670
about.
Ninety one.

752
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,210
Wow.
Yeah.

753
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,510
It fucking rock world,
Bro.

754
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

755
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:10,494
Me and my little kid to watch a real 
snake and actual code that couldn't get 

756
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:17,520
laid for months.
Man really sticks in your room.

757
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,020
You're not fucking lying to me.
I'll come on.

758
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:20,460
Wow,
please baby.

759
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,660
And you really did have the snake in the
bathtub bathtub playing in the water.

760
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,440
Oh Wow.
It's like 4:00

761
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:36,120
in the morning for a fucking drug junkie
to walk in the bathroom.

762
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,983
Now I'm paranoid is motherfucker anyway 
because I'm fucking all this shit and 

763
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,730
now I got to look down on a 15 foot 
snake.

764
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,050
That's fuck.
Got His mouth open.

765
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:46,410
Looking at my fucking little Dick.
Are you serious?

766
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,930
I'm not pissing.
What do you mean?

767
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:50,400
I gotta take a shit.
Nah,

768
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,890
not anymore.
So I go in the other room.

769
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,210
A piss in a fucking bottom.
OOPS,

770
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:55,170
I missed.
What the fuck?

771
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:57,190
Just pissed enough.
Wow.

772
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,620
Yeah.
Don't walk in my room.

773
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,130
Barefooted.
Squish,

774
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,890
squish.
What did you feed it?

775
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,540
I didn't.
You didn't.

776
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,510
Was one of the only out there for 10 
days.

777
00:38:05,511 --> 00:38:06,380
So.
So what,

778
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,300
how often they eat once ever.
Six weeks or so.

779
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,430
Oh really?
Really?

780
00:38:11,431 --> 00:38:13,380
The action and the flying and 
everything.

781
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:14,214
They'd only live for 10 days.
They had to get them off the road and 

782
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:17,124
let them heal because of snakes.
A lungs go the entire length of their 

783
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,320
body.
They're very tiny,

784
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,400
so they get pneumonia really easy.
Of course being in minus 40,

785
00:38:27,401 --> 00:38:30,620
it doesn't help either,
but they do get pneumonia really easy.

786
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:34,470
Would you have to get a new snake?
Was that your responsibility?

787
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,270
We had a guy in Stanford,
Connecticut,

788
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:43,230
he was Charles Manson revisited.
This guy was a freak brother,

789
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,243
Stanford,
Connecticut to weird plus he had a farm 

790
00:38:47,531 --> 00:38:48,364
in down Connecticut and they did not 
know that he had over a thousand snakes 

791
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:58,171
in that farm on that building in about 
150 of them are poisonous because he was

792
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:01,840
collecting venom for different,
for different pharmaceutical companies.

793
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,673
But uh,
I remember one time having to get a 

794
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:08,670
snake from him and he flew to Omaha and 
you know,

795
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,720
he'd been working with me for a couple 
of years.

796
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,250
The Albert Man will take care of you 
tonight,

797
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:18,270
but I think it was jake like will take 
you to strip joints on this family.

798
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,700
I know it's not necessarily,
hey bro,

799
00:39:22,701 --> 00:39:24,790
let me take you out.
So we get there man.

800
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,073
I use just kind of like sitting there 
and it was head down towards the table 

801
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:30,190
looking at his beer and right job.
And I'm like,

802
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,860
this motherfucker going,
you know,

803
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:38,080
so the dude pick her out if you'll take 
a price I'll pay for.

804
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:41,910
It was a mobile and buzzing.
He goes,

805
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,140
Oh jake,
just take my snakes.

806
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,440
Oh,
excuse me.

807
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,980
I just want to go back to the room and 
play as much snakes and what?

808
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,070
Change rooms?
Different floor.

809
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,160
He was a real freakazoid into snakes.
Is he still alive?

810
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,120
Yeah,
he is.

811
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,983
He was in Florida when that bet 
hurricane hit down there and he was 

812
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:08,374
working in a gator farm and poisonous 
snake venom collection point and they 

813
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:15,670
had like 800 snakes down there.
Right.

814
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So the hurricane hits and just fucking 
levels of place.

815
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,320
Why?
I'm calling for days trying to get ahold

816
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,163
of him,
see if he's all right and finally get a 

817
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:23,800
hold of me.
I'm like,

818
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,010
dude,
why are you so fucking happy?

819
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:27,970
Because that was the best time of my 
life,

820
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:29,860
man.
This is fucking like God's made this.

821
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:30,940
Especially for me.
I'm like,

822
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:31,930
what are you talking about?
He goes,

823
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,670
I get to find all those snakes.
You get to find them.

824
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,713
Let me think.
You're going to dig through all that 

825
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:39,784
Shit,
all that shit and a lift up stuff and 

826
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:47,770
stick your hand down and holes and shit 
to find these poisonous snakes.

827
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,610
Fuck you out for your fucked up.
What is it with Florida and snakes?

828
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,730
Connecticut,
man.

829
00:40:57,731 --> 00:40:59,440
Whatever.
Nobody wants to Florida.

830
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,280
It's like a magnet.
He was in Connecticut men and they asked

831
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:05,950
him to go do anything for the boy's 
Club,

832
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,830
you know,
introduce them to snakes and blah blah,

833
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:09,670
blah.
Would be great,

834
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,400
you know,
eight to 12 year olds.

835
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:17,910
So he gets in there and he's talking to 
them about this Mexican rattler.

836
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,653
Now,
first thing you know about snakes is 

837
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,394
yes,
they can be poisonous and poisonous 

838
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:23,680
snakes.
Children.

839
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,690
What happens there?
They're not healthy.

840
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,100
They weren't you.
They can kill you.

841
00:41:27,101 --> 00:41:27,880
Yes,
that's right.

842
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,010
So that's why you should always keep it 
up.

843
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,680
Oh my God.
Oh Lord.

844
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,891
Okay.
Look,

845
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:37,100
he's accidentally bit me.
You know,

846
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,440
I've been bitten now.
So I think what I'm going to do,

847
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,270
somebody called nine.
One one.

848
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,240
Um,
we're gonna.

849
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,253
I'm just gonna.
Explain to you what I'm feeling right 

850
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:47,030
now.
So if you ever get bitten,

851
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:47,864
you'll know what you're gonna.
Expect to feel after you've been bitten 

852
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,260
with talking with these girls.
Know their fees.

853
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,900
Fucking bite,
man.

854
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:54,734
Yeah,
he's fucked.

855
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,993
And he knows that he's fucked because 
here's the thing about Mexican 

856
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,050
rattlesnakes,
not many of those in Connecticut.

857
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,710
So you don't have any answers.
I've been,

858
00:42:05,711 --> 00:42:06,470
um,
do you?

859
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,400
Oh Jesus.
No,

860
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:10,550
they got to fly it in from fucking deal 
Atlanta or wherever.

861
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,440
So by the time they get that shit out 
there,

862
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,490
man,
he's fucked up.

863
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,820
And they went out and they cut all the 
meat off one of his bones on his finger.

864
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:19,730
So you got like this gnarly.
So he had a necropsy right?

865
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,983
Yeah.
I've seen a video or a website rather 

866
00:42:23,451 --> 00:42:24,284
detailing this kid got bit in the arm,
no meat had to get him somewhere to 

867
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:29,210
safety.

868
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,150
But it took hours,
that medivac helicopter,

869
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,240
his whole arm rotted away,
down to the bone.

870
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,530
So they had to take meat from his legs,
get it off and put,

871
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,490
you know,
they had to do skin grafts all over.

872
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,070
I think he went through like 16 
operations.

873
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,380
She's awful.
They had a stitch them all together,

874
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:51,040
like pull the meat of his arm together 
and stitch it all together.

875
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,070
I mean it was a giant 10 to 12 inch 
patch of his arm.

876
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:56,100
Was Gone,
yeah,

877
00:42:56,101 --> 00:42:56,934
it fucks you up.
Really cool looking thing that it does 

878
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:03,950
is it causes all the small capillaries 
in your eyes to burst.

879
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,360
So your eyes are like blood red,
except they're bumpy.

880
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,890
Uh,
you know,

881
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,880
like he closed his eyes and I run my 
finger over his eyelid and you just feel

882
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:16,790
all these little bumps and crevices and 
cat damaged.

883
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,530
Weird to take for him to recover.

884
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,090
He's in the hospital for a couple of 
weeks,

885
00:43:20,091 --> 00:43:20,924
man.
He was a,

886
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,060
he had to put him in a coma for like six
days.

887
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,680
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

888
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,780
But he cool.
He cool.

889
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,003
Is He,
does he have a tolerance to regular 

890
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:30,810
venom?
Because I know a lot of those.

891
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,790
Building a tolerance to different ones.
Yeah.

892
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:33,624
They make themselves get bit a cobra.
I think he's pretty much clean on this 

893
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:38,660
guy.
Sounds like he's going to end up being a

894
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:39,494
super villain of some kind.
He could be mad because I swear to God 

895
00:43:42,861 --> 00:43:44,510
he is Charles Manson.
Wow.

896
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,600
He looks like Charles Manson looks 
weird.

897
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:48,860
Like anyway,
he smiles just like,

898
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,420
dude,
that is not healthy,

899
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:51,710
you know,
all.

900
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,900
Fuck.
Wow.

901
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:54,734
He's a true.
Imagine what this guy would be like 

902
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:59,800
without snakes.
Thank God snakes exists where you have a

903
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:00,921
steamboat,
you know,

904
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:02,650
come up with a Komodo dragon thing,
you know,

905
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,640
to,
to combat the snake back in the day.

906
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:07,040
I don't know.
So of course,

907
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:09,730
that's who Albert Albert was,
the guy with a Komodo dragons,

908
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,353
so he had some pottery was growing up in
the mountains and he took one of the 

909
00:44:16,431 --> 00:44:20,150
dragons with him to get it out in the 
sunlight.

910
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:21,583
So they put it in this fucking station 
wagon and they go up in the mountains 

911
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:26,860
and they actually walk to their place 
where they get their stuff growing.

912
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:31,070
They closed the over up,
leave the window down.

913
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,093
That much

914
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,910
take off,
come back window's busted.

915
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,480
Oh Jesus.
Or Jesus' horrible teeth marks on all of

916
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:42,960
it where this fucking Komodo dragons and
chewing his way out of this shit.

917
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,063
He was in a wooden Katie.
He chewed his way out of the wooden 

918
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:48,060
case,
but he got out man and took off.

919
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:50,520
And I guess it's about two months later,
man,

920
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,354
I was like in Indianapolis and waking up
and listening to the news and the espns 

921
00:44:55,831 --> 00:44:56,664
on or like what was thought to be a 
prehistoric monster was found running 

922
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:03,040
across the backyard.
Ms Dot Gibbons Hills,

923
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:07,860
chasing her poor little poop when we get
back,

924
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,350
see our monster.
Wow.

925
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:12,780
They come back and I'm sitting on what 
the fuck.

926
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,533
Be prehistoric hacking.
Got to see this shit in the fucking 

927
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,573
thing.
Goes back at fucking Albert's fucking 

928
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:20,754
thing,
man.

929
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,490
It's the thing that had escaped two 
months later,

930
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,100
he had gained like 35 pounds.

931
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,880
Everybody's dogs and cats in the 
neighborhood.

932
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,390
A couple of kids to who?
That is such a ruthless animal,

933
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:34,224
you know,
those things are so ruthless that the 

934
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:36,564
little baby Komodo dragon smear shit on 
themselves so that the grownups don't 

935
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:42,630
eat them so that their parents don't eat
them.

936
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,380
They roll around and shit so that their 
parents don't eat them.

937
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,693
Because uh,
when Komodo dragons are eating 

938
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:52,490
intestines,
they shake the shit out of intestines.

939
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:57,830
They don't like to eat shit.
As weird as that is bad attitude.

940
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,590
I had a problem with cocaine.
Imagine that they eat their fucking kids

941
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:05,424
so the kids know this.
So they somehow or another like no to 

942
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:11,520
smear themselves and shit.
I'd learned pretty quick.

943
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,530
Yeah.
You see your sister get chewed up.

944
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,950
I see them avoid shit but eat your 
sister.

945
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,300
Yo.
That shit.

946
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:22,920
Is Salvation some good shit.
It had gained 30 pounds.

947
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,080
That's fucking crazy.
Yeah.

948
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,000
Let it loose in Florida.
They won't even notice.

949
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:30,520
Fuck everything else they got down.
Yeah.

950
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,140
The Florida everglades is so crazy.
Python's man.

951
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,450
So,
so bad that they're eating alligators.

952
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:37,284
They did this study.
They found that they couldn't find any 

953
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:40,374
raccoons.
They couldn't find any swamp rabbits or 

954
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,100
march hares,
I guess they call them.

955
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,830
Yeah.
Everything got killed by python.

956
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:48,930
So then the pythons moved on to 
alligators.

957
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,770
Yeah.
Alligators.

958
00:46:50,771 --> 00:46:51,604
They don't have a real man.
I've got a picture of an anaconda 

959
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,610
swallowing an 800 pound horse.
One.

960
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:04,280
It's got the head in the front legs 
already treated inside picture.

961
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,730
You know,
I need it.

962
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,250
I'll get you.
I need that fucking shit.

963
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,323
See if you could find that.
Jamie body is like this big with his 

964
00:47:12,511 --> 00:47:13,900
back.
He probably can't pull it up.

965
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,400
Jamie,
he's coming at you hard and weapons.

966
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,413
I bet.
In all your years you never thought 

967
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:24,240
Jake,
the snake would be roasting you.

968
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:28,350
Live on the Internet,
believe Dat and mail it back.

969
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:31,900
Injury and nailing a pull it up.
Reference.

970
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,453
Got you bro.
I'm not just a short phase in a pretty 

971
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:39,760
Dick.
Short dignam pretty face.

972
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:40,594
That's it.
Did you ever low the day that you came 

973
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:44,590
up with the Gimmick of having snake?
God,

974
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,880
Yah.
Imagine what everybody else is traveling

975
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:49,714
solo.

976
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:50,763
Here's the thing.
I come up with this idea like in 1975 

977
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:56,683
because I listened to Monday night 
football and they were talking about 

978
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:01,210
Kenny Stabler.
Remember him playing for the raiders.

979
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,250
I remember the name of 10 quarterback 
man,

980
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,060
swing it and boy he gets sling it man.
And he also liked to party man.

981
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:08,530
So I've dug him,
man.

982
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,380
You know what I'm saying?
Motherfuckers.

983
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,433
Cool brother.
I mean super believe he took all the 

984
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:18,820
linemen with him out to the bars.
They didn't show up a 4:30

985
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:22,900
in the morning.
Now here's the thing,

986
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,580
do the coach keep them from playing?
I don't think so,

987
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,800
but he did tell him you better fucking 
win.

988
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,950
Yeah.
That's all.

989
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,940
That's all.
What's his name?

990
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:35,710
Told him you better fucking win because 
if you don't know Marsha last bucket.

991
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,220
Oh yeah.
It's tapered.

992
00:48:38,221 --> 00:48:39,580
Took them out there and they won the 
game.

993
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,460
So.
But uh,

994
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,830
I don't know.
I don't know.

995
00:48:44,831 --> 00:48:47,590
But I love the Kenny Stabler the snake 
thing.

996
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,150
And here it is actually.
Yeah,

997
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,500
there you go.
Fucking hippo at eight.

998
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:56,080
A hippo.
Jesus Christ.

999
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,400
Oh,
well it's got to be a baby.

1000
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,700
Hippo doesn't look like it's too fucking
small.

1001
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,840
Yeah.
But hippos are huge.

1002
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:02,950
Baby Hippos.
Probably.

1003
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,160
Probably big is your Dick.
A lot of things.

1004
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:07,810
There we go.
Whoa.

1005
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,063
Which is pretty mentioned because they 
can't gurgitate they had to pull that 

1006
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:14,230
shit out.
That's insane.

1007
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,880
But we,
uh,

1008
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,950
I was riding down the road last Monday 
night football and I'd be too much,

1009
00:49:20,951 --> 00:49:22,210
man,
if a fucking wrestler,

1010
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,290
you know,
smoking some weed,

1011
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:24,124
you know,
curious snake around and fuck with the 

1012
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:29,060
other restaurants,
drinking.

1013
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:32,360
And it was more and more and more.
And uh,

1014
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:39,780
next day I woke up with my idea and less
carrying a fucking tonight what the fuck

1015
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:40,624
was I thinking?
I'm terrified of snakes because I'm 

1016
00:49:42,281 --> 00:49:43,114
terrified.
But how do you connect that to the 

1017
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:46,420
football player?
Because he was Kenny the snake.

1018
00:49:46,421 --> 00:49:48,070
Stabler.
Oh,

1019
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,500
here we go into snake.
Oh,

1020
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,850
it was just bad ass,
man.

1021
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:55,390
I wanted to be the snake too.
So you were already Jake Roberts and.

1022
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:56,800
No,
it wasn't even j Dot Robertson.

1023
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,990
And then I,
I looked for a name,

1024
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,060
the snake.
The snake.

1025
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:12,160
Fuck that guy.
Like a guy with like a golf shirt,

1026
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,390
flaky snaky.
He's got a 40 foot putt.

1027
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:19,030
He blames the snake.
Has a bad back.

1028
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,670
Not even,
not even blake would have a bad back.

1029
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,003
But,
uh,

1030
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,350
you know,
what the fuck was I thinking because I'm

1031
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:32,300
terrified of snakes.
I'll never do that fucking gimmick.

1032
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,820
Fuck that.
But I did go and said,

1033
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:37,310
okay,
I got to think of a name and Jake,

1034
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:40,750
the snake that works.
Why am I thinking that?

1035
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,700
And at the time of the TV program was 
Dallas.

1036
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,750
Who's the bad guy?
Jr Jr.

1037
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:52,590
Jake the snake.
Wow.

1038
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:58,280
And I came up with robert's,
I'm a snake.

1039
00:50:59,090 --> 00:50:59,923
Well,
after years of throwing it up there 

1040
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,460
occasionally and getting.
Are you fucking serious?

1041
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,210
Wrestling is not a fucking circus stuff.

1042
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,720
Fuck it ain't.
Excuse me bill.

1043
00:51:10,721 --> 00:51:15,721
Watch fat.
Fuck steven bastard before vince,

1044
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:21,210
before vince in the wwf.
What organization was it?

1045
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,450
Mid south.
And um,

1046
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,730
they Just fucking told under no 
uncertain terms that we've ever,

1047
00:51:26,731 --> 00:51:27,460
you know,
I'm like,

1048
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,110
wait a minute,
you don't want me to carry a snake,

1049
00:51:29,111 --> 00:51:31,510
but the guy I'm wrestling has got a 
fucking hockey match,

1050
00:51:31,511 --> 00:51:32,344
colon.
And every night he fucking head busted 

1051
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:35,583
With it and you have me carved my 
fucking forehead open so he can bleed 

1052
00:51:38,351 --> 00:51:39,880
everywhere.
But it's not A circus.

1053
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:42,350
I get that totally.
You bet.

1054
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,890
Ya know.
So blow it out the window.

1055
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:48,880
Then I went to fucking New York and 
that's when vince vincent me with the,

1056
00:51:48,881 --> 00:51:49,714
uh,
you're going to be wearing a purple or 

1057
00:51:51,491 --> 00:51:53,290
lime green span to excellence.
I said,

1058
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:58,450
ain't no fucking fag and I'm not wearing
a 85,

1059
00:51:59,531 --> 00:52:00,364
86.
I'll foRget how long vince has been in 

1060
00:52:02,021 --> 00:52:02,854
the game.

1061
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:05,780
Oh hell yeah.
He bought that guy out,

1062
00:52:05,781 --> 00:52:10,610
the guy that he bought,
he just went to every territory and just

1063
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,120
said,
oh,

1064
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:11,953
I'll give you this amount of money.
I'm just taking your cleaners with my 

1065
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:14,864
heart.
I'm giving this to you because I'm 

1066
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,840
taking your all your television.
Yeah.

1067
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:18,853
So crazy.
All the people that was all split up 

1068
00:52:20,331 --> 00:52:21,164
into territory.
So everybody had their own business and 

1069
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:25,280
reinforced age might be another one.
Territory.

1070
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:26,910
You know what's really crazy about 
vince's?

1071
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:29,680
How fucking jack is like,
what Is he?

1072
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,750
Seventy five,
64,

1073
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:37,751
65.
He was on the cover of men's fitness,

1074
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:38,834
uh,
with chains around his neck real 

1075
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:41,234
recently.
Yeah.

1076
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,200
Jack jumped in about growth hormone.
That description used to work.

1077
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,040
I think there's a lot more going on than
just growth hormone.

1078
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,580
Well,
I'm sure there is a feeling.

1079
00:52:49,581 --> 00:52:50,640
It's a stack.

1080
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,650
You gotta.
Look at this.

1081
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:58,010
This is him.
Seventy three.

1082
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:03,040
What in the fuck is that?
How is that as the billionaire tunc that

1083
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:08,780
isn't sane.
Checked his back is 73 years old.

1084
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,940
Was built like brock lesnar.
That is insane.

1085
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:14,180
He's the man.
Imagine like seeing this when you were a

1086
00:53:14,181 --> 00:53:16,160
kid,
like this is what grandpa looks like.

1087
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,533
You'd be like,
what the fuck is going on with grandpa 

1088
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:22,790
and grandma daddy?
That is insane.

1089
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:27,000
Seventy three years old there is on this
planet who works as hard as he does,

1090
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,970
but there's no other way.
It's possible.

1091
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,073
I mean the guy is,
he's he's everywhere and at one the one 

1092
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:38,340
video where he runs to the ring and is 
on his way in,

1093
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:41,820
dives into it and slams his thigh into 
the siloing,

1094
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,833
blows his fucking quad off the ball and 
then still plays it out and does it 

1095
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,514
sitting down.

1096
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,360
Must have been in unbelievable agony,
right?

1097
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:52,223
He can't even stand up and he's just 
sitting there sitting on his butt and 

1098
00:53:56,341 --> 00:53:58,080
they.
Everybody has to like improvise,

1099
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,980
but this guy sitting on his ass because 
he's.

1100
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,180
He blew his quads off of his bone.
Watch this shit.

1101
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:03,931
Look at this.
I mean,

1102
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:06,600
this is fucking crazy.
I did the same thing and tour.

1103
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,190
Look at this.
He dives in,

1104
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,640
slams it and look at it.
His leg gives out.

1105
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,580
You've done at that point,
your adrenaline.

1106
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:16,440
Oh,
you're thinking is get the fuck up.

1107
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:17,303
That's all you're thinking,
but it's crazy that he's just sitting 

1108
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:21,840
there.
The funniest part of this is this is the

1109
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:22,674
final moment of the royal rumble.
This is a huge long buildup and it's 

1110
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:28,850
controversial because they both went 
over the top and landed,

1111
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,320
so there's this tide,
so all the reps are trying to figure out

1112
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:34,350
what's going on,
so it makes it even funnier.

1113
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,910
That vince's just sitting there,
the owner stretched out,

1114
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,573
teased tiesta was that jesus christ,
he's so much bigger than he is now in 

1115
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:46,430
guardians of the galaxy.
Forget protein diet.

1116
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,060
That's all natural,
bro.

1117
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:52,630
That's vegan stuff.
yeah,

1118
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:57,600
she's kind of being stuck.
It's incredible.

1119
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:58,493
I mean,
just the fact that that guy was able to 

1120
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:01,044
do that.
I got to bring this up because we were 

1121
00:55:02,191 --> 00:55:03,024
watching this in the greenroom.
Rip before we get to dAvid arquette is 

1122
00:55:05,671 --> 00:55:07,470
wrestling.
Did you know this?

1123
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,580
Yeah.
David or kevin?

1124
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:11,760
Blood got a light bulb smashed in.
His head,

1125
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,790
cuts all over his face.
A fucking two by four.

1126
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:19,080
Two by four.
And what is the worst shit you ever get?

1127
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:21,180
Hit with a guitar,
a guitar.

1128
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,550
Oh,
that's honky tonk.

1129
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:23,643
It was a real guitar.
That's really surprising to me because 

1130
00:55:26,011 --> 00:55:30,060
it always appeared like the honky tonks 
guitar was just an exploding.

1131
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:30,894
They'll work after that.
What is this wcw world heavyweight 

1132
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:35,070
champion.
David arquette.

1133
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:35,904
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1134
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,773
He was there for awhile,
but it was a highly controversial 

1135
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,180
moment.
Heavyweight champion.

1136
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:48,000
How much does he weigh?
40.

1137
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:53,840
That doesn't make any sense.
He is definitely built Way bigger.

1138
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:54,954
He's way thicker than he's ever been 
before because when they showed him on 

1139
00:55:56,611 --> 00:55:58,230
tmz,
he was running around.

1140
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,550
He looked jack on dvds,
got diva size.

1141
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,433
now you can find the video that the tmz 
video because it's kind of fucking 

1142
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:09,270
hilarious.
Is really.

1143
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,580
And just goes to show you what happens 
though,

1144
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:15,090
man.
It's a lunch that you get for it.

1145
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:19,440
You know wrestling.
I hated wrestling growing up.

1146
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,410
Hated it because your dad did it because
my dad did it and he was home,

1147
00:56:23,411 --> 00:56:25,630
so I blamed the wrestling for him.
Never being home.

1148
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:28,510
Bottom line was he didn't give a fuck 
about kids except those eco rape.

1149
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:33,130
And look at that.
He got hit in the head,

1150
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,280
oh jesus christ.
That guy stabbed him in them gowns with,

1151
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:41,350
with a fluorescent light bulb that he 
just shattered.

1152
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,780
By the way.
You can get that dust in your eyes.

1153
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,970
Glass does,
but look how big he is.

1154
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,820
Yeah.
He's our kid was never that big before.

1155
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,410
He's looking more like an eddie 
guerrero,

1156
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:51,244
right know.
Kind of a hilarious look at jackie is 

1157
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:54,850
the.

1158
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:55,683
The thing about david doing this is that
like he just got sober a Few years ago 

1159
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:02,380
and he's doing this to keep life 
exciting for him,

1160
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:03,214
you know what I mean?
And I just was doing it or just doesn't 

1161
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:07,180
have any movie roles coming in now.
He's,

1162
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:08,620
he's,
he's okay.

1163
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:10,340
We'll do it.
I didn't know he's okay.

1164
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,010
You would use agent.
Well,

1165
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,690
I went,
no,

1166
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:15,790
but he's wrestling.
AgEnt argued you shock.

1167
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,170
Who's fucking jack?
Dude.

1168
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:19,120
I mean,
I'm very impressed with his physique.

1169
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,030
Got into executive producing a bunch of 
stuff.

1170
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:24,790
Like he's one of the executive producers
of like cougar town.

1171
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,480
Oh,
these with his ex wife.

1172
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:30,360
All these massive show runs back in and 
get stumped,

1173
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,950
but you see where you're still getting 
pushback from the guys.

1174
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,321
He goes,
no,

1175
00:57:34,321 --> 00:57:36,180
I'm going to lay doWn here.
I'm not gonna fucking get hit again.

1176
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:37,483
Oh,
and then he just hit him with a chair 

1177
00:57:38,491 --> 00:57:39,324
that broken glass on it.
This is some high level production for 

1178
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,610
50 people in the room.
Yeah,

1179
00:57:44,611 --> 00:57:45,444
exactly.
It's all though the blood and 

1180
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:49,860
everything.
Jesus christ Function glass and arrange.

1181
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:50,790
Brilliant.
Yeah.

1182
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:53,220
That is crazy.
Now that's.

1183
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,860
Then he leaves the fucking.
YeS.

1184
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,230
You could tell he was pissed.
He didn't go the way he wanted it to.

1185
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,660
Do you think he's pissed?
He was pissed.

1186
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,820
Do you think they planned the whole?
Nobody fucked him.

1187
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,350
Somewhere in there.
You get fucked.

1188
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:07,303
You think so?
Because you've seen the him going for 

1189
00:58:09,411 --> 00:58:12,780
the guy.
Then the guy just took him over and they

1190
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:15,200
started and got Back on him.
He wasn't expecting that.

1191
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:16,034
He was.
He thought he was going up and then you 

1192
00:58:18,381 --> 00:58:19,214
see him.
Then you seem just fucking get up and 

1193
00:58:20,781 --> 00:58:22,160
just fucking storm out of the fucking 
ring.

1194
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,110
Why?
When you stay and she gets fucking ass,

1195
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,470
obviously you can't see.
He's trying to get to him.

1196
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,070
The guy won't fucking let him.
Now watch guy takes him over and he's on

1197
00:58:31,071 --> 00:58:32,870
top of me looking for the one,
two,

1198
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:34,130
three.
He got the one,

1199
00:58:34,131 --> 00:58:34,581
two,
three.

1200
00:58:34,581 --> 00:58:36,920
See,
he did not want that to happen to watch.

1201
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:37,763
This

1202
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,040
just gets up.
Fuck it.

1203
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:40,874
I'm going home now.
That's interesting because you see this 

1204
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,793
from the eyes of professional.
I see this from the eyes of a layman in 

1205
00:58:49,461 --> 00:58:52,580
the crowd and I don't see that.
That's fascinating.

1206
00:58:52,581 --> 00:58:55,340
You see a double cross double girls.
No doubt.

1207
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:00,410
That's why you got the three count on 
him.

1208
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:05,300
You know he didn't look like that.
DaVid arquette sitting back knowing that

1209
00:59:05,301 --> 00:59:06,134
jake,
the snake is doing commentary on his 

1210
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:09,800
match.
I'll have david kidder day job.

1211
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,000
Ah,
sister over a year.

1212
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:15,790
Outrageous.
Listen.

1213
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:18,410
Just needs practice.
Young buck.

1214
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:18,891
I mean,
didn't.

1215
00:59:18,891 --> 00:59:21,850
Dallas didn't.
Dow started when he 36.

1216
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:27,950
Imagine that and the crazy part is you 
were one of his original mentors and the

1217
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:28,784
guy that shit I'll fucking teach you 
because eVerybody else said you're too 

1218
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:34,130
fucking old.
Specifically ric flair.

1219
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,680
Ric flair told him,
dallas,

1220
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,110
you've been a manager.
You do this.

1221
00:59:39,111 --> 00:59:41,700
Well you do that well,
but your third year six,

1222
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:42,803
get a grip on.
You know you're too fucking oldest 

1223
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,460
start.
And when dallas told me that,

1224
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:47,241
I'm like,
fuck it man.

1225
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:49,620
If it's you're running your dream.
He says my fucking dream,

1226
00:59:49,621 --> 00:59:50,454
man.
I Want it.

1227
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,890
Fuck it.
I'll teach you.

1228
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,353
And that's When I started.
I moved in with him and then we had the 

1229
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,510
inFamous snake accident in his house.
What was the infamous naked?

1230
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:07,190
I got busy with a girlfriend and forgot 
what I was doing upstairs.

1231
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:08,024
I was washing the snake off and went 
back downstairs to check on her and she 

1232
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:14,240
caught me by surprise and raped me.
Horrible.

1233
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,000
But it was great.
So I stayed and then I went,

1234
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:18,530
oh my god,
I forgot to sneak upstairs.

1235
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:20,203
So I ran back upstairs.
Realized you'd been doing a half hours 

1236
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,800
in dallas is just coming out of his 
bedroom.

1237
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:26,210
He's like,
what the fuck?

1238
01:00:26,211 --> 01:00:27,770
You been in the shower the whole time?
I'm like,

1239
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,120
yeah man.
I just thought,

1240
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,421
yeah,
I'm sweating.

1241
01:00:30,421 --> 01:00:31,254
You look at me.
I'm in the shower yet my mistake was in 

1242
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:35,740
there,
so I'll get my shit.

1243
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,820
Get it right out.
He was widely the sharp dallas.

1244
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:39,470
I was watching some soap out,
man.

1245
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:40,640
Fuck.
Get a grip man.

1246
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:43,400
Leave me alone.
So I go in and plugging bucket.

1247
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,493
Snake.

1248
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:47,240
I can't find the fucking snake.
Not in here.

1249
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,170
Oh my god.
Which kind of snake was this a cobra?

1250
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:54,070
Cobra.
They had three.

1251
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:58,220
They had three cats.
Oh no,

1252
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,770
that's what I thought too.
Oh no.

1253
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,580
So I started looking for it.
Then I had to fess up to dallas.

1254
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:05,840
What was going like doot,
doot,

1255
01:01:05,841 --> 01:01:06,674
doot,
doot.

1256
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,580
You gotta find that Motherfucker.
My wife would be home in 20 minuteS.

1257
01:01:10,581 --> 01:01:11,510
I'm like,
what?

1258
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:12,910
Holy shit.
You know,

1259
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,810
I'll fight any mammoth fucking woman.
HAle.

1260
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:16,340
no,
they will fuck you up.

1261
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,473
I run from women.
They fuck you up with your sleep and 

1262
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:24,050
shit and fucking fuck you up again 
because we have dick's.

1263
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:24,650
We think,
you know,

1264
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,010
they love me because of my dick or 
whatever.

1265
01:01:26,011 --> 01:01:26,844
And you give them an end because they're
going to hear you so much and then you 

1266
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:31,730
fall asleep.
Actual murder action.

1267
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,020
We're here we go.
I've been married three years.

1268
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,720
Experience is very different than mine.
Well,

1269
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,220
I've had three successful marriages.

1270
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:42,370
Nobody died.
I did 13 years.

1271
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:44,180
My first wife,
13 years,

1272
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:49,181
and my second wife poor month third.
So I'm getting better a lot better.

1273
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,080
But it sounds like you're talking about 
prison.

1274
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,520
I did 13 years about marriage.
I said 13 years.

1275
01:01:55,521 --> 01:01:57,420
That's like sam kinison and 80.
So it goes,

1276
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,040
it goes back to my experience.
Right.

1277
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:01,063
You know,
my experience is unfortunate because 

1278
01:02:03,331 --> 01:02:04,161
one,
I've been through.

1279
01:02:04,161 --> 01:02:08,270
I left home and get this close to me.
We're about to get started getting real,

1280
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:09,823
which is what I really want,
but then I got to push you back because 

1281
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,060
I can't handle it.
I can't handle it.

1282
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:17,660
I want to get back to this,
but what happened to the cats?

1283
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:18,643
Okay,
well,

1284
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:19,693
long story short,
I couldn't find them this long as long 

1285
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:26,850
as I was there.
How much?

1286
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:27,763
A.
Well,

1287
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:28,763
right before she got home I thought I 
would do the man thing and get my car 

1288
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,664
and run.

1289
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,800
That's what I did.
That is what he did.

1290
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:44,870
Fucking.
I had a slick fucking 84 corvette that I

1291
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:47,510
knew would not look good with high heels
going up and down it.

1292
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:48,840
Right?
Because that bitch,

1293
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:51,660
wonderful lady.
She was a wonderful,

1294
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:53,730
wonderful woman.
She was going to fuck you up.

1295
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:55,780
She gonna fuck everybody up.
Right?

1296
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:56,873
And if I'm not sleeping with you,
you're not going to talk shit like that 

1297
01:02:58,771 --> 01:02:59,604
to me.
Right?

1298
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,013
That's true.
I'll listen to it if I'm sleeping with 

1299
01:03:02,051 --> 01:03:03,630
you.
But that was it.

1300
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:04,683
I had to leave.
I came back two days later in my 

1301
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:08,700
defense,
two days later.

1302
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,353
And when I got there,
I see all these workmen carrying sheets 

1303
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:17,400
of sheet rock,
sheet rock.

1304
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:19,170
I'm like,
what the fuck?

1305
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,463
And then donald's had told me they were 
going to do some remodeling downstairs 

1306
01:03:23,811 --> 01:03:24,381
and I'm like,
oh,

1307
01:03:24,381 --> 01:03:26,210
they're working on my fucking room.
Right?

1308
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,040
It's so cool.
And he's like,

1309
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:29,900
dude,
got 15 minutes.

1310
01:03:29,901 --> 01:03:33,940
Package should go what?
You got to get out

1311
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:40,220
one little snake and I've got to go.
That's really bullshit.

1312
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,750
Dallas.
And uh,

1313
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,940
yeah,
they couldn't find the snake either.

1314
01:03:43,941 --> 01:03:46,610
So they wound up calling some people 
professionals.

1315
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,433
And the only way they found it was by 
carrying out several walls and they 

1316
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:54,020
finally found it.
One of the walls.

1317
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:54,893
What did he do?
Climate event and got in the bed 

1318
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,170
wherever,
I don't know.

1319
01:03:57,171 --> 01:03:59,840
And got into the wall and up.
Fuck.

1320
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,430
And they had to follow it through the 
house.

1321
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:04,610
How did they find it?
By running out of walls?

1322
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,280
They were quite upset.
I believe so,

1323
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,480
yeah.
My kitchen worked on once and after they

1324
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:16,481
sealed the drywall in the back,
I heard staycations cat.

1325
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:23,780
So my cat spazz bad.
She's like,

1326
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,130
shit.
I'm like,

1327
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:29,090
she's in the fucking wall.
So I had to go get a hammer and a,

1328
01:04:29,091 --> 01:04:31,520
I had a club and the wall and then pull 
her out.

1329
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:34,190
Covered in fucking that's where they get
the music.

1330
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,380
Boom,
ba boom,

1331
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:36,223
ba boom,
ba boom.

1332
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,880
Sweet cat.
Had that kevin.

1333
01:04:37,881 --> 01:04:39,140
Nineteen years.
Wow.

1334
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:45,110
Here I am in Australia.
This is like 1993 or four.

1335
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:46,603
And um,
there's a japanese superstar named 100 

1336
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:51,980
uses lighter,
I mean just top of the top brother.

1337
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:57,430
So he's on tour with no problem.
But first night he's in was,

1338
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:02,000
we'd already been there two nights and 
these people come in,

1339
01:05:02,001 --> 01:05:04,120
these jobs come in and they start 
plugging in the ag ag ag,

1340
01:05:04,121 --> 01:05:04,954
either in japanese.
So there's another guy and then english 

1341
01:05:06,621 --> 01:05:07,970
transferred and boom,
boom.

1342
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:11,200
Bottom line is he will not stay in the 
same bucket.

1343
01:05:11,201 --> 01:05:15,410
And dresser was jake.
He's terrified as do the mongo get it on

1344
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,350
him.
No does matter.

1345
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,740
He doesn't even think you should be here
because of jake.

1346
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:24,580
Okay,
fuck him.

1347
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:25,613
Let him go where everyone I'm give you.
I told you I wouldn't get it on you if 

1348
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,250
my word is not good enough.
Fuck off.

1349
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,273
So he goes and gets another dressing 
room on the other side of these 

1350
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:36,790
coliseum,

1351
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,430
on the colosseum in rome.
We across there,

1352
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:45,870
he wrestles,
goes into shower,

1353
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,570
comes out from the shower,
he's drying off.

1354
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,733
He looks up in the mirror in the mirror.
He can see a pile of cobra is come up 

1355
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:54,893
out of the toilet.
It was looking around the room and the 

1356
01:05:58,051 --> 01:06:01,260
rest of him still on the toilet.
and then he goes back down.

1357
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:03,743
He screamed.
He runs across the fucking building 

1358
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:08,070
nude,
which got everybody's attention.

1359
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:13,500
The police get involved.
It comes down to jake words,

1360
01:06:13,501 --> 01:06:16,830
your fucking snake.
I really can't find it.

1361
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:18,523
So he had gotten out of my locker room 
and went into the toilet and took off 

1362
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:28,910
and come up in that toilet over there.
She got on a fucking airplane that night

1363
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,720
and went the fuck home.

1364
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:31,733
Manages the snake that he was scared of 
her did and then went and found the 

1365
01:06:36,241 --> 01:06:39,160
place where there was the most feared.
Yeah.

1366
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,920
I wonder if that.
I mean,

1367
01:06:40,921 --> 01:06:43,530
it only makes sense that you sent your 
parents.

1368
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,750
They would go after prey animals,
right?

1369
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,580
Prayer.
My animals are terrified of them.

1370
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:52,620
They probably have a sense of fear.
The fucking toilet you imagine that goes

1371
01:06:52,621 --> 01:06:53,820
to the toilet.
I mean,

1372
01:06:53,821 --> 01:06:54,654
I still have horror stories and bad 
memories of sitting on a toilet and a 

1373
01:06:57,561 --> 01:07:01,050
snake just by the balls and that that 
happened to,

1374
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:01,884
you know,
but I had those fucking dreams come to 

1375
01:07:03,321 --> 01:07:05,410
me because I had those snakes all those 
fucking years.

1376
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:09,180
Especially after that no one can travel 
that will again.

1377
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:11,100
How'd you get the snake back?
I didn't.

1378
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,350
I left him over there and fucking in 
Australia.

1379
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:20,510
Sorry.
Now he's taking over the country.

1380
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:24,150
Jesus christ.
Where's that fucking snake?

1381
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:27,900
It's in melbourne.
That's where I left him.

1382
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:31,290
How long do those things live?
Like how long?

1383
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:32,453
Thirty years or years.
So it's probably still alive and the 

1384
01:07:34,411 --> 01:07:39,411
toilets savy of that auditorium was 
looking around and eat nash.

1385
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:43,110
Man.
Can you imagine some poor women sit down

1386
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:43,944
on the toilet?
Oh,

1387
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:45,150
that feels good.
Oh wait a minute.

1388
01:07:45,151 --> 01:07:45,984
That's not right.
What?

1389
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,740
Wow.
Wow.

1390
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:49,613
He'll sneak up the astraea,
climbed in the fucking toilet and went 

1391
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:54,720
to the one guy that was terrified of 
him.

1392
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,540
Yeah.
unbelievable.

1393
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:01,550
I remember when we did the andre andre 
is supposed to be afraid of a snake.

1394
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,443
Oh yeah.
And he faints and fakes or heart attack 

1395
01:08:03,981 --> 01:08:07,640
and he's laying there.
Poor Bobby Eaton.

1396
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:09,503
They're checking a panel on his chest 
because he's supposed to act like he's 

1397
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:15,500
had a heart attack and somebody goes 
give him mouth to mouth bobby and like,

1398
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,393
are you fucking kidding me?
Fucking giant fucking giant breath you 

1399
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:24,090
had man from drinking.
I'd rather.

1400
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:29,150
I love the giant the jasmine been when I
first got into wrestling referee in like

1401
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,760
1974,
so,

1402
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:33,490
and they came to me in this,
look,

1403
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,353
you're not refereeing tomorrow night,
but we want you to drive andrea around 

1404
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:40,423
why?
So you were a referee before you were 

1405
01:08:41,301 --> 01:08:42,134
progressing,
which is actually the best way to start 

1406
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:46,100
because you get a feel of it,
you get a feel of it,

1407
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:49,580
you learn how to feel people and you 
learn how to judge people.

1408
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:53,540
You don't know how to read people in the
crowd.

1409
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:55,320
You can read them.
But um,

1410
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,470
I got the uh,
take care of andre thing.

1411
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,440
They give me a van,
said andrea,

1412
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:02,000
I'll sit in the back,
kind of a beanbag chair,

1413
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:05,060
just taking him to the bill and he'll do
his thing.

1414
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:06,790
Give him a ride back to the hotel.
Cool.

1415
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,910
Seventy miles,
no problem.

1416
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:08,840
Eighty miles,
whatever.

1417
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:12,230
So we'll get through the show and he's 
like,

1418
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,570
beer.
Okay.

1419
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:15,870
He talks,
he walks even,

1420
01:09:15,871 --> 01:09:18,110
you know.
So I stopped and getting beer.

1421
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,770
I'm like a six pack my damn self there,
andre.

1422
01:09:20,771 --> 01:09:25,250
And he goes to cases.
It's an 85 mile trip.

1423
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:28,533
Yeah,
two cases.

1424
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:31,730
Fucking two cases.
I guess he wants some his room.

1425
01:09:31,731 --> 01:09:32,564
Right.
So we'll get back in and we start 

1426
01:09:34,011 --> 01:09:36,320
driving.
I don't know about you guys man.

1427
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:37,790
Back.
Even when I drank,

1428
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,260
until I get into that first third or 
fourth hour,

1429
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:44,630
I gotta piss like every time I have a 
beer on to piss.

1430
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:48,390
I don't really buy beer.
I just rented or rented.

1431
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:50,070
Then I go get rid of it.
But.

1432
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,720
So after you know,
30 miles I pulled it andre.

1433
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,390
Sorry I got pissed.
You know I'll get out of this.

1434
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:56,870
Get back in the van.
You don't know another thing.

1435
01:09:56,871 --> 01:09:57,990
Mirror.
Okay.

1436
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,570
Take it easy.
Fucking tired.

1437
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:00,620
I heard the pop,
pop,

1438
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,550
pop,
pop,

1439
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,020
pop.
He fucking,

1440
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:07,700
he fucking with me.
We go the closer I got to piss again.

1441
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,860
Finally get there,
gets out of this.

1442
01:10:10,861 --> 01:10:15,200
I'll get your beer.
He goes to finished what you drink?

1443
01:10:15,201 --> 01:10:16,034
Forty eight beers.

1444
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:19,550
Yeah.
Right.

1445
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:22,660
Like off of your big goof.
You know he leaves.

1446
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:24,050
I get,
I get in there.

1447
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,660
First thing I do,
I'm checking with my hand.

1448
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,220
Make sure I'm not putting my hand in 
piss because I figured this motherfucker

1449
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:30,283
got to piss.
He drank two cases of beer and do not 

1450
01:10:32,961 --> 01:10:35,690
have to piss.
I don't care if you've got drained me,

1451
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:38,870
but damn it.
how can you do that?

1452
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,170
I mean,
I felt so inadequate.

1453
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:48,500
This guy drinks 48 beers and didn't piss
48 beers and 80 miles.

1454
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,393
Yeah,
that's nothing but his hand would cover 

1455
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:54,100
that beer up subbing.
Handsworth.

1456
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,633
Just an amazing athlete.
An amazing man and to be in the ring 

1457
01:10:59,061 --> 01:11:04,061
with him was he was unbelieved when hulk
hogan hoisted him up in the air,

1458
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:09,290
in that photo of him with a regular 
sized can of beer.

1459
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:12,740
That is insane.
Doesn't even look real.

1460
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:13,890
That look real.

1461
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,430
That's a 12 ounce.
YeAh.

1462
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:16,823
Yeah.
That's a 12 ounce beer and it just 

1463
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:18,714
vanishes inside his head.
See if he can find that video of when 

1464
01:11:20,761 --> 01:11:25,590
hulk hogan picks him up over his head 
that that was fucking insane.

1465
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:27,870
How much did he weigh?
Five 5,500.

1466
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:29,880
Fifty pounds now.
Five hundred 50 pounds.

1467
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:34,170
Just hoisting over your head with a bar 
with an olympic bar is impressive,

1468
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,870
but to do it with dead weight,
with a man

1469
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,850
thing about it is it wouldn't happen.
Liz,

1470
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:41,331
andrea,
warren,

1471
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:41,670
g two,

1472
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:42,690
right.
Of course,

1473
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,850
because he's going to boost himself 
course.

1474
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:47,260
I remember him being a ring one night 
and he says,

1475
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,160
yeah,
you fucking insane.

1476
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:51,060
Like,
look at this.

1477
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,440
This is insane.
But if you look,

1478
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,270
we're andre and jar.
Yeah,

1479
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,880
she helps it.
He helps him pulling stale.

1480
01:11:57,090 --> 01:12:00,390
He had me pick him up and slammed him 
one night and he's like,

1481
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:01,200
[inaudible].
I'm like,

1482
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,850
no,
fucking whether you know.

1483
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:03,983
Yes sir.
And I went under and I all of a sudden 

1484
01:12:05,731 --> 01:12:07,890
he's here and I'm like,
holy fuck.

1485
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,753
I've got him still.
He would use that athletic energy for 

1486
01:12:11,881 --> 01:12:13,920
that and my legs just started to fucking
buckle.

1487
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,200
Yeah,
you gotta drop them fast.

1488
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:20,010
Three hundred pounds.
There is a biggie.

1489
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:20,923
Look,
I'll leave,

1490
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,110
but hogan was flocking jazz,
you know,

1491
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:27,900
I met him later in life,
but I had met him earlier too.

1492
01:12:27,901 --> 01:12:31,230
I ran into him on the street once and I 
couldn't believe how fucking big he was.

1493
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:32,403
The second time I saw him he was shorter
because he had so many back surgeries 

1494
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:37,043
that has disks,
had been fused and he's still at giant 

1495
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:41,910
human being,
but he wasn't as big of six,

1496
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,520
eight,
no more hybrid.

1497
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,530
Craper told me when I was friends with 
piper,

1498
01:12:46,531 --> 01:12:48,900
he told me that when hogan did that slam
on andre,

1499
01:12:48,901 --> 01:12:52,320
just like he could feel it just going 
all the way up.

1500
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:54,040
Is that true?
I can only imagine.

1501
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:55,740
I clothesline audrey

1502
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,250
when I,
you know,

1503
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,130
I came in and doing hard because andre 
warner did hit him hard.

1504
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:00,993
Right.
Which I used to say that's the most 

1505
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:05,500
frustrating thing in the world right 
there in her watch that you're trying to

1506
01:13:05,501 --> 01:13:07,570
kill a motherfucker and you don't even 
know it.

1507
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,650
So your name is hard as I could and he 
didn't know.

1508
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:13,743
So when you reach out and just.
I mean he used to hit me and I'd be 

1509
01:13:17,831 --> 01:13:18,664
falling.
Right.

1510
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:20,980
That's a lot of energy.
Me falling.

1511
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:25,750
He reached up and grabbed me by my hair 
and just zinc pulled me right my fucking

1512
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,470
feet and just ripped a fucking see look 
here.

1513
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:33,460
Look at that look way to 60 there.
Wow.

1514
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:37,510
That's so crazy.
That's so crazy.

1515
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:41,650
Look how fucking big he was.
He was so good.

1516
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:44,500
You did a horrible thing to be one night
in the room and he knocked me down.

1517
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:49,510
I'm on my back and he stands on my hair,
enriched on,

1518
01:13:49,511 --> 01:13:52,720
grabbed my arms and pulled.
Just rip my hair out.

1519
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:53,773
Wow.
Did you guys plan shit out like that or 

1520
01:13:57,231 --> 01:13:58,990
did he just improvise that out there?

1521
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:02,420
We went out there and played.
He liked me.

1522
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:07,230
I liked him a unreal test.
you say if you don't man up to him,

1523
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,064
he'll fucking eat you.

1524
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,143
Oh,
could you get to see the documentary 

1525
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:11,830
that they made on him?
On hbo

1526
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,380
savage now andre?

1527
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:14,880
Yeah.
No,

1528
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,471
no,
no.

1529
01:14:15,471 --> 01:14:17,200
I didn't see it.
It's really great.

1530
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:20,240
You'd really love it.
I don't want to hurt too much.

1531
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:23,240
Yeah,
it made me.

1532
01:14:23,241 --> 01:14:24,860
It made me cry.
So yeah,

1533
01:14:24,861 --> 01:14:27,260
it makes me cry.
You know what that man went through?

1534
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:28,213
What did he go through?
Which just people pointing and laughing 

1535
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,830
in pain can.
Constantine was unbelievable.

1536
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,120
Yeah.
Because of wrestling.

1537
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,060
No,
because because of the growth,

1538
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:40,220
just january growing,
continuing to grow,

1539
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,820
you know,
it's.

1540
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,320
Think about a water daily days.
Well,

1541
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:46,000
a bed don't fit too well.
Right?

1542
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:50,280
Let's talk about hotels and bathrooms.
Where's he going to go?

1543
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:53,210
Right.
Where does he sit in the bathtub?

1544
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:56,690
No,
that's the only place you could yet.

1545
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,120
We're still going to take his ass,
didn't they?

1546
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:01,610
He's got to squish it and they just got 
it.

1547
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:02,623
No,
he just fucking turned the shower on 

1548
01:15:03,471 --> 01:15:05,030
man.
Let it dissolve it.

1549
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:07,583
How'd you,
how would you like to do hot yoga and 

1550
01:15:08,491 --> 01:15:13,491
that bathroom with that shower.
Praying god damn shit in the bath tub.

1551
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,850
Airplanes.
Cars.

1552
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:19,110
Well,
you know,

1553
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:21,960
giant helmet.
So did he have his house set up for him?

1554
01:15:21,961 --> 01:15:23,070
yeah.
wow.

1555
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:26,930
It's another thing we're paper told me a
great story about,

1556
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:27,803
you know how everybody would always.
He would just get so harassed out in 

1557
01:15:31,321 --> 01:15:35,690
puBlic and they were out drinking one 
night after shows and they were in on in

1558
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,530
some college town,
like we'll say madison,

1559
01:15:37,531 --> 01:15:38,364
Wisconsin or something like that and 
they're having some drinks at a bar and 

1560
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,590
piper was like,
these kids,

1561
01:15:43,591 --> 01:15:45,120
these frat boys,
you know,

1562
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:48,520
they noticed that a few tables away and 
someone there,

1563
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:52,560
an empty beer can hits andre in the back
of the head and hits the ground.

1564
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:54,150
You know,
andre looks around,

1565
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:55,750
oh,
and they're hanging out.

1566
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:58,260
A couple mInutes later,
another empty beer can hits.

1567
01:15:58,261 --> 01:16:02,730
Andre growls a little bit harder and 
then a third beer can comes.

1568
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:06,060
And andre stands.
He had hits him in his head.

1569
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:07,390
Andre stands up,
you know,

1570
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:09,660
it takes them awhile to get out of the 
booth or whatever.

1571
01:16:09,661 --> 01:16:10,494
Wherever they're at.
Any nice guys get up and they start 

1572
01:16:12,691 --> 01:16:15,870
running and they chase andre chases 
them,

1573
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:16,704
but when he gets out of the bar,
they are in their car about to pull 

1574
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:20,004
away.
And andre literallY goes under the car 

1575
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:23,580
that's out front of the Bar and flips it
over.

1576
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:24,683
there's a cop,
a half a block away who pulls up and 

1577
01:16:28,731 --> 01:16:31,790
arrest them for fucking with andre the 
giant.

1578
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,970
He flips their car with them.

1579
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:39,730
Those guYs mess with me.
I two beer cans.

1580
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:43,920
We were wrestling in montreal.
It was his birthday picture.

1581
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:45,393
He could do a backflip,
standing on the top rope and do a flip 

1582
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:49,870
where you land on his feet when he first
started.

1583
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:52,163
But uh,
I'm wreStling him and then we had this 

1584
01:16:53,921 --> 01:16:54,754
little thing we'd do where you get me in
the corner and then he just still let 

1585
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,943
wade into me,
you know,

1586
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,430
which was pretty easy to,
to register.

1587
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:01,713
And then I would slide down and then 
he'd grab each side of the rope under 

1588
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,373
the last drop.
Of course he's got these ropes all that 

1589
01:17:08,621 --> 01:17:09,454
night he wanted to do it and then hand 
slipped who saw all of a sudden his ass 

1590
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:14,700
plans right here.
And just,

1591
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:16,483
you know,
I heard fucking vertebrates and I'm 

1592
01:17:17,871 --> 01:17:18,980
like,
can I breathe?

1593
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,870
I just want to know if I give a brief 
because I couldn't.

1594
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:25,870
At the moment I was like screaming and I
turned over on my side.

1595
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,473
we got,
how bad is it because I figured I'd 

1596
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,150
figure my sternum was broke,
whatever,

1597
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:36,770
and he sits on me and I'm laying there.
I'm Trying to get some a breath,

1598
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,810
trying to let everything come back and 
I'd seen the lights coming in.

1599
01:17:39,811 --> 01:17:40,644
At first I was going to pass out and 
then I hear andre laughing when I hear 

1600
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:50,240
the referee saying,
andre,

1601
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:53,830
why are you laughing as hard?
And I'm like,

1602
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:54,873
what?
And I could feel my shoulders is 

1603
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:59,690
vibrating like,
and he's 13,

1604
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,610
you know,
on the giant can fart.

1605
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,950
How long?
About 40 seconds.

1606
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:09,440
He's like,
but it was a steady flow.

1607
01:18:09,441 --> 01:18:14,441
It wouldn't mean he got up.
I had like a wiNe stain on my shoulder.

1608
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,620
That amazing,
amazing guy,

1609
01:18:21,621 --> 01:18:24,190
man.
But I used to think to myself,

1610
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:25,043
the fans really don't like me because 
they're putting me out there in the 

1611
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:29,093
fender,
cheered me on to charge into that 

1612
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:35,570
fucking big giant you want me to get 
killed on show fans or fishes?

1613
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:38,180
What are Y'all doing this to me?
Don't cheer me.

1614
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:41,720
Tell me I'm a stupid fucker.
and to get out of the ring for the giant

1615
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:43,560
each.
You know,

1616
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:44,413
fun and that was that hard to always be 
a great bad guy or did you sort of 

1617
01:18:49,311 --> 01:18:50,144
relish in that?
Being a good guy is so boring because 

1618
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:58,010
people expect you to be nice.
They expect you to this picture with the

1619
01:18:58,011 --> 01:19:03,011
baby,
but as a bad guy you can do anything and

1620
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:05,610
it's okay.
You know what I mean?

1621
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,020
And then you get to see how far you can 
take people.

1622
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:13,040
You know what I mean?
Some people freak is kind of bugs.

1623
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:16,730
People freaks them out a little bit to 
thinking about starting a riot,

1624
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,130
but that's when you know you'Ve done 
your job right?

1625
01:19:19,970 --> 01:19:20,803
When you can get people to step out of 
their comfort zone and come into the 

1626
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:27,380
ring after you.
Now you'Ve done the job.

1627
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:29,990
Did you have that happen?
How many times?

1628
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,330
I'll probably 30,
40 times.

1629
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:33,470
Thirty,
40 times.

1630
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,830
People charge the ring.
Well,

1631
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,120
it got bad.
It got bad couple of times.

1632
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,880
One time was the worst one.
Being in dallas,

1633
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:43,360
Texas,
which is like 60 miles from my hometown.

1634
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,700
What started it?
Uh,

1635
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:49,190
with wrestling sting.
The guy stood up about nine rows back,

1636
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:50,503
reached inside of his jacket,
pulled out a nine millimeter and got 

1637
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:55,920
three shots off before they got him.
Oh,

1638
01:19:56,030 --> 01:20:00,200
I'd already dived underneath the ring.
Staying being the stupid.

1639
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,230
Yeah.
He's in the ring.

1640
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,160
You staying?
I'm not coming back,

1641
01:20:04,161 --> 01:20:04,994
bitch.
You know this guy got three shells off 

1642
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,033
me.
I remember going into the back thinking 

1643
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:11,730
to myself,
you fucking got them out there.

1644
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,583
You take them that far.
You're making people do shit they would 

1645
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:16,284
not normally do because they got him.
But here's what they brought into the 

1646
01:20:20,401 --> 01:20:21,234
bag.
and you're like,

1647
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:23,880
you wanna to press charges.
Press charges.

1648
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,680
No,
just reload the motherfucker.

1649
01:20:25,681 --> 01:20:27,480
put it back out there.
What the fuck do you think?

1650
01:20:27,481 --> 01:20:28,320
Press jar.
Of course.

1651
01:20:28,321 --> 01:20:29,760
I want to press charges,
man.

1652
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,313
He put three holes in the building of 
the old fucking atory in there and 

1653
01:20:33,761 --> 01:20:34,594
dallas.
He shooting or was he just shooting at 

1654
01:20:36,051 --> 01:20:37,360
the ceiling at me?
Yeah,

1655
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:42,150
related my ass.
I had a woman 75 years old.

1656
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:44,800
Cut me with a box cutter.
What's?

1657
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:45,743
Yeah,
and the first time she'd ever been to 

1658
01:20:46,951 --> 01:20:47,784
watch wrestling.

1659
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:51,030
What?
What did you do to start that?

1660
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:52,733
She had been at home with her grandkids 
and they were watching me wrestle and 

1661
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:58,740
they were like,
oh granny,

1662
01:20:58,741 --> 01:21:00,150
they'll get so and so.
Jake roberts,

1663
01:21:00,151 --> 01:21:00,661
he's,
oh,

1664
01:21:00,661 --> 01:21:02,110
he's so bad.
He is.

1665
01:21:02,111 --> 01:21:05,280
Somebody needs to wash his damn mouth.
Alice open spank his ass.

1666
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:06,870
What that man needs.
You know,

1667
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:07,813
somebody should have straightened him 
out earlier in his life and they're 

1668
01:21:09,211 --> 01:21:09,871
like,
oh great.

1669
01:21:09,871 --> 01:21:11,310
He shut up.
You wouldn't have done anything.

1670
01:21:11,311 --> 01:21:14,070
He'd run from him too.
I would not run from that man.

1671
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:18,600
And they basically challenged the 
grandmother not knowing it.

1672
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:22,650
She's a little off.
Next time I come to town,

1673
01:21:22,651 --> 01:21:26,350
she gets fucking ticket.
She's going to show those grandkids.

1674
01:21:26,351 --> 01:21:27,580
She's not afraid of me.
Wow.

1675
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,060
Jesus christ.
I came down the aisle.

1676
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:35,020
I got security around me and all of a 
sudden my securities.

1677
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:38,520
ThIs is fucking great.
Turn to see what they're doing.

1678
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:43,490
There's a woman that's down and they're 
all over and thinking,

1679
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:45,000
well,
she have a fucking heart attack,

1680
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:46,110
man.
What's going on?

1681
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:47,600
Hey guys,
what's going jake?

1682
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:50,000
She fucking cut you man.
I'm like,

1683
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:51,210
oh,
you're full of shit.

1684
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,520
Look at your arm.
Holy shit.

1685
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:54,620
The fucking chicken.

1686
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:02,190
How bad did she cut?
You know,

1687
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,890
30 stitches.
Jesus christ box.

1688
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:07,290
You just didn't realize that you don't 
feel the box cutter.

1689
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:08,124
You're sharp.

1690
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,670
So I get to the back with her.
He said,

1691
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:15,480
I hear the story.
You know what actually happened?

1692
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:18,810
And I just looked at it and said,
can I hug you?

1693
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:22,290
You want to hug me?
I'm like,

1694
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,153
yeah,
I do.

1695
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:23,941
Yeah,
I do.

1696
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:25,650
Come here.
And I hugged her.

1697
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:30,570
I started crying.
She started crying and jesus goes up the

1698
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:35,610
wife number two or three.
That's why it only lasted for a month.

1699
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:42,030
She ran out of blades.
Go.

1700
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:43,790
What the fuck,
man?

1701
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:47,730
You're a better man than me.
What you did kick her though was a good,

1702
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:50,300
solid,
nice,

1703
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:54,500
gentle to jesus.
all your teeth.

1704
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:55,450
Uh,
yeah.

1705
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:55,980
Yeah.
Well,

1706
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:58,490
I'm going to root canals one.
Really?

1707
01:22:58,491 --> 01:22:59,720
Yeah.
How long did you fight?

1708
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:02,100
Not that long.
I wore a mouthpiece.

1709
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,290
Fifteen minutes.
Twenty minutes.

1710
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:04,910
While I move a lot.

1711
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:10,470
There's a big difference in amount of 
punishment that you would take progress.

1712
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:13,210
Punish me.
Take sparring or fighting

1713
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:16,580
16 slash 17.
Root canals.

1714
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,990
Jesus christ,
man you,

1715
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:20,873
and as you get older,
the teeth deteriorate and those root 

1716
01:23:25,101 --> 01:23:25,934
canals,
that tooth just winds up turning into 

1717
01:23:28,401 --> 01:23:31,760
dust and they start breaking off and 
pieces and stuff.

1718
01:23:31,761 --> 01:23:32,594
And man,
it probably didn't help in my spiral 

1719
01:23:35,691 --> 01:23:38,840
down either,
man that I couldn't go eat,

1720
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:40,573
you know,
I had to be checked and see what I was 

1721
01:23:42,081 --> 01:23:42,914
going to eat and make sure I just put 
new poly grip in and you start eating a 

1722
01:23:47,091 --> 01:23:50,420
steak with polygraph and then boom,
it breaks loose and next thing you know,

1723
01:23:50,421 --> 01:23:52,610
your fucking mouth bleeding because it 
broke loose.

1724
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:54,530
And ryan,
you havIng to go to the bathroom,

1725
01:23:54,531 --> 01:23:55,490
you know,
makes it a date.

1726
01:23:55,491 --> 01:23:56,960
So nice.
You know,

1727
01:23:56,961 --> 01:23:57,794
there's nothing that says love chewing 
on your girlfriends and your teeth fall 

1728
01:24:00,531 --> 01:24:01,860
out on our belly button,
you know,

1729
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,410
it just turns them away.

1730
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:07,520
That sucks,
man.

1731
01:24:07,521 --> 01:24:09,050
You know.
And did you.

1732
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:10,730
You never warm out.
No,

1733
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,440
you can't do the wrestling.
You swallowed it.

1734
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,750
That's the difference.
But,

1735
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:15,720
you know,
I,

1736
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:18,320
I got real fortunate that,
uh,

1737
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:22,070
some people out of dallas,
they got one in vegas,

1738
01:24:22,071 --> 01:24:24,290
also g for it's called,
uh,

1739
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:26,323
they,
uh,

1740
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:29,990
should look at,
we see you're having a problem.

1741
01:24:29,991 --> 01:24:31,460
We see you doing,
you're talking.

1742
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:34,520
And I talked like this because I didn't 
want,

1743
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:35,703
right?
Because my teeth were constantly coming 

1744
01:24:36,741 --> 01:24:40,130
loose and it didn't matter how many 
times I got new ones,

1745
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:40,973
but they still sucked.
So these people g form and they finally 

1746
01:24:44,661 --> 01:24:47,600
came to resident's room real.
I'm like,

1747
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,553
yeah,
right.

1748
01:24:49,610 --> 01:24:50,443
So he told me implants.
Well I didn't know a lot about that 

1749
01:24:52,071 --> 01:24:53,120
shit,
you know.

1750
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:55,760
And uh,
they uh,

1751
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:57,103
come back to me and they said new to 
dallas and I'm dr goldberg who was 

1752
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,170
saying his name and the blue 11 implants
in.

1753
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:09,410
And uh,
it was pretty bad,

1754
01:25:09,411 --> 01:25:10,540
man.
I had a bad day.

1755
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:13,460
It's hard tO medicate me and put me out 
because I,

1756
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:14,713
rachel's level's too high.
So during while I was out and they were 

1757
01:25:18,441 --> 01:25:19,274
pulling teeth,
getting ready to put the things into 

1758
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:26,360
screw into.
Evidently during all that process,

1759
01:25:26,361 --> 01:25:28,240
I just stood up and started pissing on 
the doctor

1760
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:29,223
personally,
everybody in the room and chasing them 

1761
01:25:30,911 --> 01:25:34,400
and complete fucking idiot.
Was tHis why you were so busy?

1762
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:35,340
Yeah,
yeah,

1763
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,101
yeah.
I sobered up,

1764
01:25:36,101 --> 01:25:36,934
but see they had gave me so much shit to
put me out that I keep moving this 

1765
01:25:40,781 --> 01:25:41,620
bullshit going.
Hey,

1766
01:25:41,621 --> 01:25:43,090
fuck you.
And I'm fucking get me digging.

1767
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:43,983
But this is.
I'm saying this is like during your 

1768
01:25:45,461 --> 01:25:46,530
sobriety here.
Yes.

1769
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:47,373
Yes.
So this is recently a year and a half 

1770
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:51,070
ago.
Jesus christ,

1771
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:54,010
they did this for my teeth,
man,

1772
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:57,760
being locked in a small room with jake.
The snake,

1773
01:25:57,761 --> 01:25:59,250
he pulls his dick out,
starts pissing out.

1774
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:02,440
And you think you got to medicaid,
got bars in his teeth.

1775
01:26:02,441 --> 01:26:04,040
He tried to give him some safety.

1776
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:08,840
What was even nicer was the next day,
they didn't even hold it against me.

1777
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:10,623
I know I woke up the next morning,
I don't remember them taking me to the 

1778
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:13,214
hotel and put me in bed or any of that 
and I didn't know what the vaseline on 

1779
01:26:16,341 --> 01:26:17,480
my ass was for.
But anyway,

1780
01:26:17,850 --> 01:26:20,510
I'm just kidding.
But I woke up the next morning,

1781
01:26:20,511 --> 01:26:22,220
I'm like,
who's fucking closure these?

1782
01:26:23,790 --> 01:26:27,920
Because they basically undressed me 
there and get the piss all off of me and

1783
01:26:27,921 --> 01:26:30,470
put new clothes on me.
I'm like,

1784
01:26:30,471 --> 01:26:31,304
what the fuck's going on?
Did they have to buy clothes for you or 

1785
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:37,840
the reserves that got somebody out there
at the place in the.

1786
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:40,910
They dressed me and I came back the next
morning.

1787
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:41,763
Um,
I haven't been there for five hours a 

1788
01:26:43,461 --> 01:26:46,830
day before they sent me down and said 
this won't take.

1789
01:26:46,831 --> 01:26:48,190
But about 15 minutes over a year.

1790
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:49,043
Right.
And they come in and here's your new 

1791
01:26:51,051 --> 01:26:53,300
teeth.
Put them up and screw them in.

1792
01:26:53,301 --> 01:26:56,240
Man,
I could bite a bumper on the car.

1793
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:57,653
No shit is so unbelievable.
If anybody out there to have an issue 

1794
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:03,740
with her teeth,
man,

1795
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,030
get them fixed,
but you know,

1796
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:05,883
fix the right way.
Don't fuck around with getting partial 

1797
01:27:08,811 --> 01:27:12,380
plates and all that bullshit.
Go ahead and bite the bullet.

1798
01:27:12,381 --> 01:27:13,214
It's expensive.
It no doubt it's expensive to change my 

1799
01:27:16,881 --> 01:27:19,850
whole life.
That is the guy that did my hair,

1800
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:23,870
you know what I mean by lobbying?
I wanted there because jake,

1801
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:25,790
the snake has hair.
Well,

1802
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:26,624
jake,
the snake at the end of the line didn't 

1803
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:29,720
have no fucking hair.
It was all gone.

1804
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:31,303
And uh,
some people in atlanta where I was 

1805
01:27:35,251 --> 01:27:36,290
living,
paramount,

1806
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:38,810
paramount,
plastic surgery and stuff.

1807
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,550
They said,
look,

1808
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:41,990
we'll give you a head of hair,
man.

1809
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:44,900
you know why we're jake the snake,
man,

1810
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:48,470
we love you.
And that's like 30 slash 40 grand,

1811
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:49,550
man.
I know you love me,

1812
01:27:49,551 --> 01:27:52,070
but you're going to do that.
Really?

1813
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,140
and that's one of the things in the 
movie.

1814
01:27:54,141 --> 01:27:56,980
You know why the people come up with 
money for my shoulder?

1815
01:27:57,010 --> 01:28:00,200
Oh my god,
I cry so hard at that part of that movie

1816
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,150
when they,
when you guys are expecting,

1817
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:08,630
what knows,
it's 17,000

1818
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,680
in the 24 hour span,
which more than paid for my,

1819
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,720
almost had enough to get a tip job,
which I was going to happen,

1820
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:18,950
put on my back that way you'd have 
something to play with it.

1821
01:28:18,951 --> 01:28:21,070
You have to get down to your shoulders.
a labor room tear.

1822
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:22,370
No,
it was a tutor,

1823
01:28:22,371 --> 01:28:23,950
coach person,
bone spurs,

1824
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:28,340
bone spurs.
And one of the spurs was over two inches

1825
01:28:28,341 --> 01:28:31,940
long.
And here's the great news.

1826
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:35,330
I think I've got it back.
You got to spur back.

1827
01:28:35,331 --> 01:28:37,630
I can move my arm and I can feel that 
fucking thing in there.

1828
01:28:37,631 --> 01:28:39,830
Go across a muscle.
It's like,

1829
01:28:39,831 --> 01:28:41,910
are you fucking kidding me?
But you sure?

1830
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:43,460
Yeah.
Did you get an mri?

1831
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:47,350
Not yet,
but I tended worn off.

1832
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:48,703
But what I'm getting at here,
and he's like the number of people that 

1833
01:28:52,401 --> 01:28:56,300
reached out to me,
condensed shit from me that didn't have.

1834
01:28:57,770 --> 01:29:01,040
People didn't even know.
It just blows me away.

1835
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:01,980
Well,
just

1836
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,813
think about how many people you touched 
over your entire career and how many 

1837
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:08,270
people ran away from home.
Yeah,

1838
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:09,620
macho man got bit

1839
01:29:10,030 --> 01:29:12,850
and it's crazy because back then 
everybody's like,

1840
01:29:12,851 --> 01:29:15,700
this is the scariest guy.
We hate this guy,

1841
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:16,543
bu this guy.
and then it's like years later they 

1842
01:29:19,031 --> 01:29:20,590
realize,
whoa,

1843
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:22,840
that guy moved me.
Like,

1844
01:29:22,841 --> 01:29:25,960
it's like originally everybody was 
afraid of you or hated you.

1845
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,153
But it's like,
it's all in retrospect when they 

1846
01:29:29,021 --> 01:29:30,490
realized,
holy shit,

1847
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:31,720
this guy,
I can help him.

1848
01:29:31,721 --> 01:29:32,554
This guy,
man,

1849
01:29:32,590 --> 01:29:36,010
he earned it from me.
He deserves this guy changed my life,

1850
01:29:36,011 --> 01:29:36,281
blah,
blah,

1851
01:29:36,281 --> 01:29:37,020
blah,
blah.

1852
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:37,853
Scene in the movie when it's unexpected 
and the guys are in the ring and they 

1853
01:29:42,181 --> 01:29:45,500
play the music and you start walking 
around with a bag snake in it.

1854
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:48,000
Yeah.
That's pretty Incredible.

1855
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,520
It was after all the shit that you had 
been through

1856
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:51,693
with sobriety,
all the shit that I stirred up while I 

1857
01:29:53,841 --> 01:29:55,040
was drunk.
Yeah.

1858
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,110
You know,
because I mean,

1859
01:29:57,111 --> 01:29:57,944
it amazes me how many people have 
forgiven me for the things that I said 

1860
01:30:02,451 --> 01:30:05,300
or did when I was under the influence.
Man goes,

1861
01:30:05,301 --> 01:30:08,660
let me tell you something.
There is nothing more viral than a drunk

1862
01:30:08,690 --> 01:30:09,523
addicted,
hating motherfucker feel like I was and 

1863
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:14,960
I wouldn't have.
I had,

1864
01:30:14,961 --> 01:30:17,210
did not mind going after venture.
Anybody else?

1865
01:30:18,430 --> 01:30:19,570
You know,
I hated life.

1866
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:23,590
So I wanted her to say I don't give a 
fuck if you hate me.

1867
01:30:23,591 --> 01:30:24,850
You know,
guess what?

1868
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:26,950
I hate me more than you could aid me.
Loser.

1869
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,770
You are going to make me much.
You know?

1870
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:33,010
That's what amazed me.
People helping me.

1871
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:38,011
It's like all those years that I used to
cringe when somebody would say,

1872
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:38,831
hey,
would you,

1873
01:30:38,831 --> 01:30:39,700
oh my baby.
I'm like,

1874
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:44,850
hold your baby.
You don't know what the fuck I am.

1875
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:49,203
Don't make me do that because it would 
hurt me inside to pull that kid in and 

1876
01:30:56,191 --> 01:30:57,024
smile and lie.
I'm not a good liar when it comes like 

1877
01:30:59,941 --> 01:31:00,774
that.
A guy like vince wanted me to do a 

1878
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,760
commercial one time a just say no 
campaign.

1879
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,780
that's hilarious.
Let me fucking do this.

1880
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:17,190
you know funny bins,
right?

1881
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:18,983
Right.
Because I know what it's like not to be 

1882
01:31:20,491 --> 01:31:24,480
able to say no,
they're no worse feeling in the world.

1883
01:31:24,481 --> 01:31:25,314
Man.
Here you got something on his hand 

1884
01:31:27,041 --> 01:31:27,874
that's going to kill you are you got 
live over here and there's green 

1885
01:31:31,961 --> 01:31:33,850
pastures and all this happy,
happy,

1886
01:31:33,851 --> 01:31:34,684
happy,
and you're going to have a good 

1887
01:31:35,051 --> 01:31:39,250
relationship with a woman if you're just
going to take the poisonous tree.

1888
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:42,460
You know what's ironic is that your 
movie,

1889
01:31:42,461 --> 01:31:43,294
your film,
your story and who you are right now is 

1890
01:31:45,851 --> 01:31:46,684
one of the best.
Just say no commercIals they could ever 

1891
01:31:48,221 --> 01:31:52,810
do that may be for real,
because you can't just say no,

1892
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:56,200
no,
no ridiculous bullshit ever said.

1893
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,093
Yeah,
and when you show that in the film that 

1894
01:31:59,381 --> 01:32:00,160
you want to say

1895
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:00,993
no,
I mean this is one of the more powerful 

1896
01:32:02,621 --> 01:32:03,454
things about that film is not just that 
you succeeded but that you tried and 

1897
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:10,270
failed several times until you succeeded
and you detailed all of it,

1898
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:13,540
all the warts and all,
every single step of the way.

1899
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,510
it's a very brave movie,
man.

1900
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,510
It really is shit out.
No,

1901
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:20,830
no you didn't.
That was tough.

1902
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:21,753
but now I'm getting to do the right 
thing and for me I'm doing this comedy 

1903
01:32:29,621 --> 01:32:30,454
thing and it's not really comedy.
I just go out until road stories and 

1904
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:32,761
shIt.
You know,

1905
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:36,570
I could have the storage module,
I just told you much.

1906
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:41,380
I do the same stuff in buildings,
but I've wrestled for 36 years,

1907
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:47,010
so I've got about 10 shows to do and I'm
still on the first one going around with

1908
01:32:48,011 --> 01:32:50,440
it and I've been doing it for two and a 
half years now,

1909
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:54,430
but now I'm enjoying it so much.

1910
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:59,590
Not because I'm making people laugh 
because I'm getting connected.

1911
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:01,780
I'm getting to connect with people that 
are needing help.

1912
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:04,690
People come to the show and tell them,
hey,

1913
01:33:04,691 --> 01:33:05,524
give me the icky man.
Afterwards we'll go find a place and 

1914
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:08,583
talk in some of the stories I have met.
Make my story sound like a fucking walk 

1915
01:33:14,591 --> 01:33:15,580
in the park,
man.

1916
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:20,710
I mean some of the horror stories I've 
heard where people are going through and

1917
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:25,210
suffering through and their story.
They're paying their anger,

1918
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:27,370
you know,
pay my shit,

1919
01:33:27,371 --> 01:33:28,204
looks weak compared to what these pigs 
and I'm getting to hear this and I'm 

1920
01:33:30,701 --> 01:33:31,534
getting to help them find the way.
And then I get to hear the stories of 

1921
01:33:35,321 --> 01:33:36,940
the success stories.
Hey man,

1922
01:33:36,941 --> 01:33:39,520
I didn't start getting cleaned out her 
about you starting to get clean.

1923
01:33:39,521 --> 01:33:41,150
And I started to try and,
hey,

1924
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,130
guess what jake?

1925
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,440
I got two years in now.
I got four years in that.

1926
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:45,573
Those are great.
But the best is the letter from the six 

1927
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:53,521
year old says you helped my daddy.
My daddy loves you and I love you too.

1928
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:56,350
Because my dad,
he lives with me now.

1929
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:58,930
Wow.
Oh fuck me man.

1930
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:00,280
Wow.
You know,

1931
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:02,350
wow,
you can't buy that shit.

1932
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,230
Can't buy that.
So I get what dallas does.

1933
01:34:05,231 --> 01:34:06,910
You know,
when he helps people,

1934
01:34:06,911 --> 01:34:09,010
he gets a high off of him.
God bleSs him.

1935
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:13,520
He should get high off of it because he 
spends a lot of time doing bro.

1936
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:14,523
a lot of time.
That's the one thing I always thought 

1937
01:34:17,081 --> 01:34:17,914
about dallas.
He may not be the smartest guy in the 

1938
01:34:20,231 --> 01:34:21,064
room,
but he's smart enough to know that and 

1939
01:34:23,561 --> 01:34:26,200
he'll go find that right answer.
You know,

1940
01:34:26,201 --> 01:34:27,760
whatever he was dealing with.
Me and scott,

1941
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,070
he didn't know how to be an addict or 
what that was about.

1942
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:31,023
So what'd you do?
He contacted all of his buddies or his 

1943
01:34:33,371 --> 01:34:38,371
ex buddies that had been through it and 
he went and he read and he read any self

1944
01:34:39,731 --> 01:34:41,710
taught man.
He used to have a problem reading.

1945
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:42,553
We've got it down now.
So here's a guy that overprepared for 

1946
01:34:46,481 --> 01:34:47,890
everything.
Yeah.

1947
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:49,360
As far as I'm concerned,
but well,

1948
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,233
that's also why you started ddp yoga to 
figure out a way to heal his body 

1949
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:54,640
itself.
Yeah.

1950
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:56,160
Now he shared.
Yeah.

1951
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:57,890
Not just sharing it,
but promoting it

1952
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:00,510
worldwide if you ever done it.
No,

1953
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:01,670
I haven't.
Well,

1954
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:04,310
I mean I did do a little bit of it years
ago.

1955
01:35:04,311 --> 01:35:06,710
I looked up the.
I found a little bit of it on youtube.

1956
01:35:06,711 --> 01:35:08,240
I never got the actual program

1957
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:09,673
to the program.
You can make it as easy as you want or 

1958
01:35:11,491 --> 01:35:12,324
you can make it as difficult as you want
and that's the beauty of it because you 

1959
01:35:15,421 --> 01:35:19,550
could get somebody like nimble nuts over
here with a sprain,

1960
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:20,910
sprain,
angina.

1961
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,553
Ah,

1962
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:26,730
diners warped out of shape.
He can't help himself.

1963
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:28,363
God,
it's like the snake when it tries to 

1964
01:35:29,631 --> 01:35:33,030
find the japanese,
he just likes playing with round things.

1965
01:35:33,031 --> 01:35:33,680
You'll there,
doesn't he?

1966
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,980
The knobs you.
He's stroking the knobs.

1967
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,393
Unbelievable.

1968
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:39,960
Cool things about ddp yoga is the,
you know,

1969
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,930
you see all those before and after of 
the physical transitions of people.

1970
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:49,320
But with those pictures don't show is 
the mental presence that you get.

1971
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:50,673
I mean I was,
I was in chicago doing gigs a few years 

1972
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:57,340
ago and this was after I got to see your
movie when it first premiered,

1973
01:35:57,341 --> 01:36:00,060
I actually think it was david arquette 
that got me and my.

1974
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:02,260
Because we made friends at the comedy 
store years ago.

1975
01:36:02,261 --> 01:36:03,094
He got me and my buddies in on a.
You guys had your premier on sunset 

1976
01:36:06,521 --> 01:36:08,920
boulevard at that.
I'll take your word for it anyway.

1977
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,353
And so I had already seen the movie,
but scott was the net that and I don't 

1978
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:17,350
believe you were there either and make 
the big ones.

1979
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:18,333
Yeah.
And so I was in chicago doing a gig and 

1980
01:36:21,911 --> 01:36:22,744
it's one of those morning radio shows 
that I didn't want to have to do that 

1981
01:36:25,601 --> 01:36:27,490
friday morning,
6:00

1982
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:28,450
AM pickup or whatever.

1983
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:29,283
I just flown in and I almost,
I remember I almost called in sick to 

1984
01:36:34,361 --> 01:36:36,370
that radio show because I'm like,
I'm doing,

1985
01:36:36,371 --> 01:36:37,140
you know,
I don't want to.

1986
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:37,973
I am just tired.
I don't want to do it slow getting 

1987
01:36:41,111 --> 01:36:42,010
there.
Yeah,

1988
01:36:42,011 --> 01:36:44,260
sure.
The back of his spirit flight.

1989
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:46,660
But I ended up not calling in sick.
I'm like,

1990
01:36:46,661 --> 01:36:47,494
let's just do and make coffee and the 
hotel and get the fucking car because 

1991
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:52,210
that's what you do.
Right.

1992
01:36:52,211 --> 01:36:56,070
Exactly.
And as soon as I get there to like,

1993
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:57,340
man,
cow in the morning,

1994
01:36:57,370 --> 01:36:58,240
right.
They're like,

1995
01:36:58,241 --> 01:37:00,070
you'll never believe who else is in 
studio with a.

1996
01:37:00,071 --> 01:37:01,300
You're a wrestling fan,
right?

1997
01:37:01,301 --> 01:37:02,800
I'm like,
yeah,

1998
01:37:02,801 --> 01:37:05,740
they're like,
Scott Hall is also going to be here with

1999
01:37:05,741 --> 01:37:06,310
you.
I'm like,

2000
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:09,250
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
And I remember,

2001
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:10,480
oh,
brushed your teeth.

2002
01:37:10,481 --> 01:37:11,480
And I remember,
you know,

2003
01:37:11,610 --> 01:37:13,540
I remember hoping because I just seen 
that movie.

2004
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:14,351
I'm like,
oh man,

2005
01:37:14,351 --> 01:37:15,540
I hope that,
you know,

2006
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:17,560
I hope he's still in good shape and 
everything.

2007
01:37:17,561 --> 01:37:21,340
I hope everything's cool because I know 
how hard it is to stay clean as an attic

2008
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:25,350
and and my god,
if he wasn't just and,

2009
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:27,250
and you know,
you as well here today,

2010
01:37:27,251 --> 01:37:29,560
it's like,
it just completely present.

2011
01:37:30,380 --> 01:37:32,320
Not.
You can't even tell.

2012
01:37:32,321 --> 01:37:35,800
You've probably had 20,000
concussions in your life,

2013
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:38,050
you know,
I mean just,

2014
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:41,740
they're looking around laughing,
smiling.

2015
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:46,300
My mind was blown that he was as 
present,

2016
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:50,050
if not more than a lot of the other 
available older,

2017
01:37:50,051 --> 01:37:53,530
most let more progress.
Slurs that I had met,

2018
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:56,010
you know what I mean?
And that I had met,

2019
01:37:56,011 --> 01:37:57,750
he was in it.
He was being funny.

2020
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:59,860
He's reacting towards june.
Yeah.

2021
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:00,763
It was an on the job compared to the guy
that gets scooted in on that wheelchair 

2022
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:06,293
that can't walk.
And when he's first starting with the 

2023
01:38:07,771 --> 01:38:10,230
chairs,
you can hear his bones cracking.

2024
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,450
Oh yeah.
When you heard his hip.

2025
01:38:12,530 --> 01:38:15,670
Oh,
it's a wonderful man.

2026
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:16,543
And it was just

2027
01:38:16,820 --> 01:38:20,860
to replace it in the first one sucked.
The second one man,

2028
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:23,680
they went through the front.
That's the way to go.

2029
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:27,520
I went in at 7:00
AM at noon.

2030
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:31,150
I jerked covers back until my daughter,
me,

2031
01:38:31,151 --> 01:38:32,740
my pants,
or I'm walking out naked,

2032
01:38:33,230 --> 01:38:34,063
put my fucking pants on,
put my feet down and walked straight 

2033
01:38:36,761 --> 01:38:38,020
out.
No cane,

2034
01:38:38,021 --> 01:38:39,310
no nothing.
Really.

2035
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:42,370
In five hours you can do that.
Not supposed to.

2036
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:46,570
The doctor was yelling at me as we were 
leaving the building.

2037
01:38:46,571 --> 01:38:47,404
What was he saying?
You get back the fucking blow the whole 

2038
01:38:52,391 --> 01:38:53,224
thing probably,
but I use walking in a crosswalk to 

2039
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:56,554
connect the two buildings and I had 
already went up to the bottom and I was 

2040
01:38:58,091 --> 01:39:00,630
going to the car and he's beaten on the 
fucking window.

2041
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:01,473
Light was like a full hip replacement.
Severed the top of the femur and they 

2042
01:39:04,211 --> 01:39:05,260
put a new joint.

2043
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:07,720
They screw it.
You ever seen how they do it?

2044
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,310
Oh,
it was marlboro.

2045
01:39:09,830 --> 01:39:10,663
Drive it in.
There is a god damn huge bolt that goes 

2046
01:39:13,091 --> 01:39:13,924
in the center of your bone and it goes 
right through the bone and screws in 

2047
01:39:17,321 --> 01:39:18,154
place and then you have this new joint.
The first one I had was brutal because 

2048
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:23,163
the whole joining calcified,
it took him three and a half hours to 

2049
01:39:27,731 --> 01:39:29,770
get it out.
Oh god.

2050
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:33,550
And they said they finally went to like 
bring in the big hammer,

2051
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:36,790
you know,
they went from these shiny silver hammer

2052
01:39:36,791 --> 01:39:41,330
to get clogged fucking sledge out from 
the truck and bring it on.

2053
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:44,620
And you know how a cauliflower ear your 
starts,

2054
01:39:44,621 --> 01:39:45,000
right?
Yeah.

2055
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,320
You know what it is yet?
Yeah.

2056
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:48,670
The breaking cartilage.
Yeah.

2057
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:50,200
Blood blood,
blood,

2058
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:51,093
blood calcifies.
So blood becomes really turns into a 

2059
01:39:54,131 --> 01:39:54,964
rock.
You get that in your nose and he's 

2060
01:39:56,831 --> 01:39:57,030
getting.

2061
01:39:57,030 --> 01:40:00,880
He had that in his joint,
so he basically had rocks in his joint,

2062
01:40:01,150 --> 01:40:05,740
completely calcified.
That's fucking arm wrestled for three or

2063
01:40:05,741 --> 01:40:06,574
four years like that.
I'll show you guys and we can come back 

2064
01:40:08,651 --> 01:40:09,484
and talk about it.
What I would do is couldn't do anything 

2065
01:40:13,381 --> 01:40:14,940
with this yet.
No one can hear you,

2066
01:40:14,941 --> 01:40:19,941
unfortunately when you do this.
And then I would sleep and grabbed the.

2067
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,060
Yeah,
yeah.

2068
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:24,700
I was bending the femur.
The femur was born.

2069
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:27,283
So you,
you are putting so much torque in that 

2070
01:40:28,771 --> 01:40:29,604
you were blowing your hip out of socket.
So your left hook and rotate out of 

2071
01:40:33,421 --> 01:40:35,590
socket.
But it would been the femur bone.

2072
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,670
Fuck that.
I did it for the doctor and he was like,

2073
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:39,533
oh my god.
Because when I first witnessed seeing 

2074
01:40:40,471 --> 01:40:42,000
the dogs,
like how'd you get it?

2075
01:40:42,001 --> 01:40:43,140
And I saw when I drove.
He goes,

2076
01:40:43,141 --> 01:40:44,010
no,
how'd you get to the room?

2077
01:40:44,011 --> 01:40:44,461
I'm like,
oh,

2078
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:47,330
what is impossible?
I've seen your expert.

2079
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,420
There's no way you can walk the fuck I 
can't.

2080
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,171
And I showed him.
He was like,

2081
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:53,290
oh my god.
He runs out of the room of my.

2082
01:40:53,291 --> 01:40:54,010
Okay.
I know I got

2083
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,843
cancer.
I'm dying.

2084
01:40:55,230 --> 01:40:58,300
That's the difference between a regular 
person that when a guy like you,

2085
01:40:58,330 --> 01:41:00,940
like your tolerance for paints probably 
through the fucking roof,

2086
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:03,680
he probably just so accustomed to it.
Recognize it.

2087
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,130
yeah.
Well obviously with your Arm broken when

2088
01:41:06,131 --> 01:41:07,150
you wanted to keep wrestling,

2089
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:10,480
don't you don't recognize pain because 
it's just somethings you do.

2090
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:11,913
You know.
There were times in my career where 

2091
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:15,190
people are like,
stop,

2092
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:17,440
like it's okay.
I'm all right.

2093
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:20,190
Well it's a lie because you are not 
right.

2094
01:41:20,191 --> 01:41:23,620
It's just adrenaline flowing so much and
you're so jacked on that shit.

2095
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,340
You know?
That's the real drug and adrenaline.

2096
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:29,583
Alright,
with that,

2097
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:31,520
jamie will show you how to do it,

2098
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:35,543
but your back in this,
I think the tension from this spring 

2099
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:38,890
trap,
you're will save your life,

2100
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:41,663
man.

2101
01:41:41,790 --> 01:41:43,770
Now when you do in these traveling 
shows,

2102
01:41:43,771 --> 01:41:45,800
you doing them in comedy clubs,
what are you doing?

2103
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:47,280
How many clubs,
bars,

2104
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:51,890
hotel,
convention room,

2105
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:52,803
whatever.
That's got to be great for you too 

2106
01:41:53,701 --> 01:41:54,534
because at the beginning of the film,
one of the things that was evident was 

2107
01:41:57,691 --> 01:41:58,524
that you missed,
you missed the whole excitement of 

2108
01:42:01,051 --> 01:42:02,130
performing.
It was.

2109
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:05,580
It was missing from your life,
so now you've got that back,

2110
01:42:05,581 --> 01:42:07,680
but also healthy,
healthy,

2111
01:42:07,681 --> 01:42:10,470
positive,
and then also helping people.

2112
01:42:10,770 --> 01:42:11,640
Absolutely.
Man,

2113
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:14,610
it's such a joy to help people,
but it's.

2114
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:15,990
You know,
when I first went back,

2115
01:42:15,991 --> 01:42:18,660
man,
because I abused myself so much,

2116
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:22,190
my memory was shot.
I couldn't remember shit man.

2117
01:42:23,010 --> 01:42:23,843
And then as I tell one story,
a little glimmer will happen over here 

2118
01:42:27,691 --> 01:42:30,910
and then then I'll talk to somebody in 
the crowd and they'll mention,

2119
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:32,790
I'm like,
I didn't wrestle that guy.

2120
01:42:32,791 --> 01:42:33,624
The hail you didn't tell and I don't 
remember wrestling this guy doing this 

2121
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:39,930
with that one and they make me remember 
stuff.

2122
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,333
Like I said,
now I've got like 10 shows waiting and 

2123
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:46,020
at first I had to really struggle to get
one show together.

2124
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:48,720
Did you write them all out?
I did in the beginning.

2125
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:52,440
Now I just write bullet points and I can
pull them back up,

2126
01:42:53,070 --> 01:42:54,990
which was so nice to do,
you know,

2127
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:57,420
because I was an appointment with my 
speech.

2128
01:42:59,430 --> 01:43:01,040
Wouldn't finish sentences.
And then just,

2129
01:43:01,230 --> 01:43:02,010
you know.

2130
01:43:02,010 --> 01:43:02,843
No.
So in the film you did it with mick 

2131
01:43:03,381 --> 01:43:04,214
foley.
Are you doing them with mick on the 

2132
01:43:05,251 --> 01:43:05,720
road?

2133
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:06,081
No,
no,

2134
01:43:06,081 --> 01:43:07,160
no.
I'm doing good ones now.

2135
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:12,850
Great.
Never seen my show now.

2136
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:17,040
Can just shut up and getting a car.
Got to turn the mic.

2137
01:43:17,041 --> 01:43:22,041
I opened up for a few years ago now.
Reframing your god damn Sure.

2138
01:43:22,801 --> 01:43:27,801
Never closed for me.
You're a wrestler.

2139
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:33,630
I'd say maybe I can get you into tv.
Squash match,

2140
01:43:33,650 --> 01:43:35,730
kid squash.
Match.

2141
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:38,450
When you just go in and pummeled with 
god for three minutes and squashing,

2142
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:40,320
lay them out on the floor.
He doesn't even get to breathe,

2143
01:43:40,321 --> 01:43:41,154
you know,
so that was like you're telling another 

2144
01:43:42,241 --> 01:43:43,140
wrestler,
hey,

2145
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,290
I'll see if we can't get you into squash
match every.

2146
01:43:45,291 --> 01:43:47,310
It's like saying you know,
you're a piece of shit.

2147
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:49,940
I'm just going to use you and toss you 
over in the corner when it's done.

2148
01:43:49,970 --> 01:43:52,130
Was that like a rite of passage?
do you have to do squash

2149
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:55,160
matches?
A lot of guys don't know.

2150
01:43:56,340 --> 01:43:57,173
We did back in my day though.
He started at the bottom and you work 

2151
01:43:59,581 --> 01:44:02,730
your way up now you've got guys who go 
to school for three months.

2152
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:04,760
Yeah.
They never learned their art.

2153
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:05,923
Well,
when you go into school to learn 

2154
01:44:07,041 --> 01:44:08,910
wrestling,
and this is not something that existed,

2155
01:44:08,911 --> 01:44:11,690
it didn't exist.
Is it kinda like school for standup?

2156
01:44:11,790 --> 01:44:12,690
Exactly.
Yeah.

2157
01:44:12,691 --> 01:44:14,130
I think it's exactly like that.

2158
01:44:15,010 --> 01:44:18,610
Like there's,
there's classes that I teach is stand up

2159
01:44:18,790 --> 01:44:23,710
and the good thing about it is you get 
at least you start doing it like whether

2160
01:44:23,711 --> 01:44:26,440
or not they're actually teaching 
anything is very debatable.

2161
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:27,803
And the things that they are teaching is
all in ring technique and torches and 

2162
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:35,240
the crumbs are right.
And the thing that you know,

2163
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,193
us die hard wrestling fans now miss with
the product is exactly what you 

2164
01:44:41,281 --> 01:44:46,281
specialized in,
which is psychology cutting promos.

2165
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:48,473
I mean he wants to cut a promo.
I remember against hulk hogan where you 

2166
01:44:51,271 --> 01:44:54,900
said something like if you plant grass,
grass will grow.

2167
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:57,450
If you plant rice,
rice will grow.

2168
01:44:57,770 --> 01:45:00,360
And if you plant fear in your opponent's
head,

2169
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:02,603
ah,

2170
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:04,653
I remember,
I'll tell you the best interview I ever 

2171
01:45:07,111 --> 01:45:12,111
did back in the day,
we'd have to do 70 or 80 interviews back

2172
01:45:13,801 --> 01:45:16,710
to back.
And the tv guys,

2173
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:17,573
tv guys used to fight for getting me 
because they knew it was going to be 

2174
01:45:20,281 --> 01:45:22,170
fucking cakewalk.
Some guys,

2175
01:45:22,171 --> 01:45:23,290
you know,
like The ultimate warrior,

2176
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:24,293
those guys take 26.
Go ahead and they'd sit there like 

2177
01:45:28,921 --> 01:45:31,230
pulling teeth.
But for me,

2178
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:33,870
my nickname is one take.
Jake.

2179
01:45:34,090 --> 01:45:35,700
Yeah.
So give me something.

2180
01:45:35,701 --> 01:45:36,534
They throw a word out there,
not just do the whole fucking interview 

2181
01:45:37,811 --> 01:45:39,540
out that word.
Just fucking around.

2182
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:41,190
So I'm there one day,
I'm like,

2183
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:42,720
oh,
I got one guy that got one.

2184
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:43,900
Okay jake,
what are you gonna do?

2185
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:49,370
Just so and,
and I went in there like,

2186
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:54,390
we're not getting any sound here.
I'm like,

2187
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,250
motherfucker,
do I tell you just to roll it?

2188
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:59,250
Just rolling.
So I do it again,

2189
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:03,020
making no sound for like 30 seconds and 
then only.

2190
01:46:03,330 --> 01:46:04,163
Oh,
tell the little boys next to you that 

2191
01:46:06,841 --> 01:46:11,160
you're not scared of jake.
Why don't I just made you get up and fix

2192
01:46:11,161 --> 01:46:12,570
the television?
That wasn't broken.

2193
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:16,610
Didn't you come to the tv like I said to
you,

2194
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:20,610
did you couldn't fix it.
Tell your wife I said hello.

2195
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:22,593
Wow.
Chilled interview shells from head to 

2196
01:46:25,181 --> 01:46:26,860
toe.
You're sick.

2197
01:46:26,861 --> 01:46:27,694
Fuck.

2198
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:34,130
Also the,
the life that you were living,

2199
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:35,023
you could probably pull those dark 
thoughts out like other people probably 

2200
01:46:39,291 --> 01:46:40,810
can't sit in a bar man

2201
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:45,820
and a right shift and the next day I'd 
pick it up.

2202
01:46:47,010 --> 01:46:49,070
Oh my god,
what the fuck was I,

2203
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:51,570
you know,
it just horrify me.

2204
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:52,404
But yeah,
sometimes you can pull the dark out of 

2205
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:59,940
bad moments in life when you had 
experiences.

2206
01:46:59,950 --> 01:47:01,890
I mean,
I mean just trying to kill yourself with

2207
01:47:01,891 --> 01:47:03,690
pills or whatever the fuck you were 
doing.

2208
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:04,973
The darkness that you had in your life,
like my sister being murdered and shit 

2209
01:47:09,361 --> 01:47:14,361
and my mother,
my mother was a 12 year old girl and her

2210
01:47:15,031 --> 01:47:20,031
mother was dating my father.
Her mother was my grandmother passed.

2211
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:29,240
My father left that and went into a 12 
year old who girls room and raped her.

2212
01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:33,563
That's me.
That's how I got started and then later 

2213
01:47:38,161 --> 01:47:38,994
in life my father was raping.
My sister did not know it and he raped 

2214
01:47:43,801 --> 01:47:45,630
another daughter.
Did not know it.

2215
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:52,130
Always heard whispering.
So people whispering in,

2216
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:54,540
even in the,
I don't know what the books are,

2217
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:55,383
problem.
Not getting the ring with somebody that 

2218
01:47:57,691 --> 01:47:58,524
had that knew my dad and they beat the 
fucking shit out of me because they 

2219
01:48:02,441 --> 01:48:05,650
hated him because I'd seen some of the 
shit that he did.

2220
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:09,040
You want to believe that of your own 
father?

2221
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:14,230
You don't want to believe that because 
you don't want to believe that dude.

2222
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:18,880
I was the girl that you met earlier.
Cody.

2223
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:25,520
She is the first daughter of mine that I
held in my lap.

2224
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:33,090
She was 22,
22 before I would ever pick up.

2225
01:48:33,611 --> 01:48:38,611
One of my daughters said my in my lap 
because I was afraid of,

2226
01:48:39,021 --> 01:48:42,340
turned into my father.
Never wanted that.

2227
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:48,450
I never to be someone that abused a 
child because I didn't abuse.

2228
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:51,230
I knew what that shit was like.
I knew what it did to my fucking head,

2229
01:48:56,300 --> 01:49:01,300
getting right and getting sober warning 
to talk about it helps a lot.

2230
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:07,130
It makes it better.
You don't cure it,

2231
01:49:07,810 --> 01:49:12,170
you know you never get over it,
but I can deal with it now.

2232
01:49:12,590 --> 01:49:14,700
I don't have to go medicate.
It went.

2233
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:15,573
Now,
when you talk to these people that 

2234
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:20,090
you're also helping your medium that 
also have these problems,

2235
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:22,580
how many of them have also been abused?
A lot.

2236
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:27,320
A lot.
You know what it's like to be sitting at

2237
01:49:27,321 --> 01:49:32,321
a comicon and a look out there and 
there's people in your line and your eye

2238
01:49:34,491 --> 01:49:36,050
contact.
Contact your kid.

2239
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,510
He looked at the kid and they look at 
you and you're like,

2240
01:49:39,630 --> 01:49:41,480
for motherfucker,
you're going through it too,

2241
01:49:41,481 --> 01:49:42,314
aren't you?

2242
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:45,800
And I can tell it.
I know that putting kids,

2243
01:49:45,801 --> 01:49:46,634
being sexually abused,
he can see it and I hate that feeling 

2244
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:51,633
because then they get up to the front 
and you're like trying to talk to them 

2245
01:49:53,111 --> 01:49:54,580
and they're like,
shut down completely,

2246
01:49:56,350 --> 01:49:59,440
and then the fucking asshole is next to 
them is probably doing the bullshit.

2247
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:02,050
He's wanting.
My contention,

2248
01:50:02,051 --> 01:50:02,884
man.
What chance did I have him getting good 

2249
01:50:05,351 --> 01:50:07,480
attention?
Not much.

2250
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:11,050
I keep going back to the kid.
How can you tell you?

2251
01:50:11,051 --> 01:50:11,950
Just feel it.
You know,

2252
01:50:11,951 --> 01:50:12,940
it,
smell it,

2253
01:50:12,990 --> 01:50:15,250
taste it.
If you see the fear,

2254
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:16,613
you know,
and you see the way that the dad 

2255
01:50:18,431 --> 01:50:21,070
communicates with them and you see their
reaction,

2256
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:23,870
they won't look at you with their eyes,
you know,

2257
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,890
really hard to get them look at me in 
the eyes,

2258
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,550
really is.
No,

2259
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:34,450
I remember I told somebody one time that
probably the one thing that helped me in

2260
01:50:34,571 --> 01:50:35,404
my early life about going through all 
that sexual abuse in bullshit was I 

2261
01:50:38,891 --> 01:50:42,630
learned that a lot at a very young age 
reason.

2262
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:46,690
I learned that a lot because it helped 
me get me to a safe place.

2263
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:49,000
You know?
Uh,

2264
01:50:49,001 --> 01:50:51,280
I learned to judge people and their 
attitudes,

2265
01:50:52,150 --> 01:50:52,983
you know,
I knew what buttons to push and what 

2266
01:50:54,521 --> 01:50:55,354
buttons not to push with my stepmother 
and I knew what was a safe place and if 

2267
01:50:58,550 --> 01:51:00,430
there were key words that come out from 
her,

2268
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:01,403
I knew to fucking go hide.
I had to start reading this shit and I 

2269
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:05,374
had to start coming up with storylines 
and stuff to get me out of shit so I 

2270
01:51:07,961 --> 01:51:10,330
wouldn't be put into the position to get
gotten again.

2271
01:51:11,890 --> 01:51:13,570
When you're learning that shit at 12 and
13,

2272
01:51:13,571 --> 01:51:14,950
brother,
you're getting some fucking knowledge,

2273
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:20,290
but it's a motherfucker man,
you know,

2274
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:23,210
just to have to go through it.
And uh,

2275
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:25,790
I don't know,
brother,

2276
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:27,980
there was ever a reason to,
uh,

2277
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:32,070
bring back the big one gas or bullets or
whatever.

2278
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:32,923
Hang,
I think paint perfect for anybody that 

2279
01:51:35,771 --> 01:51:37,510
abused kids.
My,

2280
01:51:37,530 --> 01:51:41,020
a public fucking fuck.
Five years in jail.

2281
01:51:41,021 --> 01:51:41,854
Fuck you mother fucker.
Put you dancing on the end of a rope 

2282
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:48,460
that get people's attention.
Might stop some of it.

2283
01:51:49,390 --> 01:51:50,223
Yeah.
I don't know how to stick with what 

2284
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:53,260
would they do that would stop it 
completely,

2285
01:51:53,261 --> 01:51:54,094
but it's.
It's one of the most disturbing 

2286
01:51:56,411 --> 01:51:59,530
characteristics of people that that,
that that's even possible.

2287
01:51:59,531 --> 01:52:00,364
Nobody wants to talk.
Nobody wants to talk about the damn 

2288
01:52:02,681 --> 01:52:05,920
shirt because here's what happens to the
kid.

2289
01:52:05,930 --> 01:52:07,480
No,
nine times out of 10,

2290
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:10,030
they raised their hand and they say 
something.

2291
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:12,970
Then this group comes in,
this group comes in,

2292
01:52:12,971 --> 01:52:13,804
cops come in and they say,
this ashes that lays probably just 

2293
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:17,810
exaggerating this,
that this age,

2294
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:20,110
you have to go home with them.
Whoa,

2295
01:52:20,111 --> 01:52:20,944
fuck no.
You can't put that kid back in that 

2296
01:52:23,290 --> 01:52:24,220
house.
Right?

2297
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:26,740
What jesse have now.
Right?

2298
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:31,270
Or you end up in an orphanage where 
you're eating right again.

2299
01:52:31,271 --> 01:52:32,104
Yeah.
Who does?

2300
01:52:32,270 --> 01:52:33,103
Yeah.
Share at an orphanage and more than a 

2301
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:37,000
predator.
And that's the other problem is a lot of

2302
01:52:37,001 --> 01:52:38,290
kids,
they get abused like that.

2303
01:52:38,291 --> 01:52:40,140
Wind up abusing other kids.
Absolutely.

2304
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:41,500
Even what you're taught.

2305
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:42,463
Yeah.

2306
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:46,070
Sandusky at that whole charity for kids

2307
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:48,460
have this whole like thing,
nut map.

2308
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:49,713
Yeah.
I'm going to open up the abused 

2309
01:52:50,841 --> 01:52:53,030
children's home.
That way I know where to go get one

2310
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,400
knew that the kids were damaged and they
would be used to it.

2311
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:00,510
Oh,
you know what we,

2312
01:53:00,570 --> 01:53:02,850
what we call love.
It can be an ugly thing.

2313
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:04,083
You know?
Sometimes your kid looks to get his ass 

2314
01:53:08,221 --> 01:53:11,610
kicked because that's the only type of 
loving knows that's true.

2315
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:13,513
You're a powerful man to have gone 
through all this and to be able to 

2316
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:19,940
express it so honestly to to everybody.
I mean that,

2317
01:53:19,941 --> 01:53:20,774
that.
That is an amazing thing because the 

2318
01:53:23,361 --> 01:53:28,361
pain of your experiences has not stopped
you from expressing all of the,

2319
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:30,253
all the downsides of it,
but also that you've come out of it on 

2320
01:53:33,591 --> 01:53:36,320
the other end in a Very positive way.
I mean,

2321
01:53:36,321 --> 01:53:38,720
you're a great guy to be around your 
funniest shit.

2322
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:39,593
You,
you have amazing stories and you're 

2323
01:53:40,941 --> 01:53:41,774
clean.
Now.

2324
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:43,353
I'm funny in a room like this,
but there's not any competition come 

2325
01:53:45,621 --> 01:53:46,130
along,
joe.

2326
01:53:46,130 --> 01:53:47,410
Just me.
Fuck.

2327
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:50,750
Where do you go from here?
You know lapdog 27.

2328
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:53,270
No,
tHat's amazing.

2329
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:54,113
It really is.
I just want to help somebody else feel 

2330
01:53:56,561 --> 01:53:58,090
what I felt.
Yeah,

2331
01:53:58,190 --> 01:53:59,023
because I don't want them to have to do 
the things that I did to quit feeling 

2332
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:05,453
because I'll tell you,
it's a whole lot easier to pick up 

2333
01:54:07,691 --> 01:54:12,050
cocaine and forget about it than it is 
to go through counseling.

2334
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:16,510
Go through this,
go through live hip 25 fucking times.

2335
01:54:17,970 --> 01:54:20,340
She know you go into counseling and they
say,

2336
01:54:20,341 --> 01:54:22,110
okay,
tell us exactly how it happened.

2337
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:26,490
Do I really fucking want to do that?
What do you want me to do that?

2338
01:54:26,491 --> 01:54:28,620
So you can use it over there and Jack,
what?

2339
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:31,230
What's your not on this because that's 
what we're thinking,

2340
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:33,480
right?
What do you want me to remember it?

2341
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:37,080
I want to fuck fucking forget it.
Forget it.

2342
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:39,270
Right.
Tell me how to remember it.

2343
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:41,070
I got it down.

2344
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:46,590
What was ultimately what was ultimately 
the thing that allowed you to stay clean

2345
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:50,610
when you had faltered five or six times,
whatever it was,

2346
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:51,623
what was ultimately the thing that 
allowed you to get past all this and 

2347
01:54:54,661 --> 01:54:57,030
just to embrace sobriety and being 
healthy?

2348
01:54:57,370 --> 01:54:58,450
I think it was just

2349
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:06,340
realizing that I wasn't going to fail 
this time and that came from dallas.

2350
01:55:09,921 --> 01:55:12,190
Not giving up on me.
See,

2351
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:14,650
I was scared that he was going to give 
up on me.

2352
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:16,123
so it's almost like you were failing so 
that he would give up on so I can get 

2353
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:21,980
that over with.
I know it's going to hurt,

2354
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:23,203
but god damn it.
I can't deal with this thought of how 

2355
01:55:24,441 --> 01:55:25,274
much it's going to hurt.
I'd rather it hurt right now and you 

2356
01:55:27,681 --> 01:55:28,514
kicked me out and then I can go over 
here and get something that'll make me 

2357
01:55:31,191 --> 01:55:32,024
forget about this bullshit.
So it's always hanging over your head 

2358
01:55:33,681 --> 01:55:35,990
that you're going to fuck up.
And finally,

2359
01:55:35,991 --> 01:55:36,824
when I realized,
no matter how many times I've looked up 

2360
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:43,860
to so much going to be there and uh,
again,

2361
01:55:45,241 --> 01:55:47,070
man,
three years,

2362
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:49,230
I don't want to live with me for three 
years.

2363
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:52,130
My shoe dude,
I texted him.

2364
01:55:53,110 --> 01:55:53,943
Well,
I texted him as he's a saint after I

He's tough.

2383
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:35,470
Well,
if you look at how healthy the guy is in

2384
01:56:35,471 --> 01:56:38,240
his sixties and how flexible he is and 
how,

2385
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:41,020
how mobiley is and we want to judge like
him,

2386
01:56:42,670 --> 01:56:45,790
his back is fucked up,
but he could do everything and it's just

2387
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:49,570
because his muscles are so strong all 
around his back is completely supported.

2388
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:51,430
Lists the old story of you,
if you.

2389
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:53,250
If you don't use it,
you lose it,

2390
01:56:53,530 --> 01:56:54,363
right?
Yeah.

2391
01:56:54,410 --> 01:56:55,243
Yeah.
I'm listening from listening to him on 

2392
01:56:58,051 --> 01:57:01,140
your podcast.
He talks about how he doesn't extreme 10

2393
01:57:01,141 --> 01:57:04,500
minute stretching to start his day and 
I've really,

2394
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:05,393
really put that inaction.
It's still stuck with some stuff from 

2395
01:57:08,191 --> 01:57:09,900
animals.
He was like,

2396
01:57:09,901 --> 01:57:11,770
no,
watch the dog in the morning for fucking

2397
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:13,530
gets up.
What does the dog do?

2398
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:14,483
Stretch those paws out in front of him 
and arch sat back and he watched dallas 

2399
01:57:19,021 --> 01:57:19,880
do is fucking work,
right?

2400
01:57:19,881 --> 01:57:20,714
Wait a minute.
Downward dog and now you're doing the 

2401
01:57:24,481 --> 01:57:26,020
arch in the bag.
Like a fucking cat.

2402
01:57:26,170 --> 01:57:28,170
What the fuck you bastard.

2403
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:29,900
Yeah,
he's a smart man.

2404
01:57:30,650 --> 01:57:31,483
He's a powerful man too.
I mean he just what he has in his head 

2405
01:57:35,450 --> 01:57:36,283
in terms of his vision for helping 
people and how he's able to see that 

2406
01:57:39,531 --> 01:57:40,364
through and that having that 
accountability crib and putting 

2407
01:57:43,311 --> 01:57:45,530
everybody through these workouts on a 
daily basis.

2408
01:57:45,531 --> 01:57:48,920
I mean the amount of time invested in 
helping you guys.

2409
01:57:49,010 --> 01:57:51,740
This is fucking amazing and not just you
guys,

2410
01:57:51,741 --> 01:57:52,491
but many,
many,

2411
01:57:52,491 --> 01:57:53,690
many,
many people

2412
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:57,910
in my only fear is not going to get out 
there about,

2413
01:57:58,270 --> 01:57:59,103
oh,
he's getting out there and mark is 

2414
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:02,880
lucky.
We were helping a whole other world that

2415
01:58:02,890 --> 01:58:03,723
doesn't know him yet.
People have known about him more and 

2416
01:58:05,201 --> 01:58:06,034
more.
I know you really appreciate your show 

2417
01:58:07,361 --> 01:58:08,194
them what it did for him that he should 
have just fucking rockfell rock doesn't 

2418
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:12,810
fucking world because it's feeding that.
I mean,

2419
01:58:12,820 --> 01:58:15,790
it's feeding his ego and keep going.
It really is true.

2420
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:17,630
Doing something nice.
Makeshift,

2421
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:18,513
feel good.
It doesn't really get talked about 

2422
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:22,540
enough.
Bad news channel.

2423
01:58:22,541 --> 01:58:24,580
Why not right now?
You're right,

2424
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:27,580
my brother.
Happy shit.

2425
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:29,010
Right?

2426
01:58:29,010 --> 01:58:29,940
There's a lot of that.
Well,

2427
01:58:29,990 --> 01:58:31,080
you know,
people are scared.

2428
01:58:31,081 --> 01:58:34,950
They like watching fear based things 
because if it bleeds it leads.

2429
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,620
But if you're hurting so bad.
Yeah.

2430
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:40,350
Well I think the problem is even calling
it news,

2431
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:42,370
you know,
it's adverse events,

2432
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:43,263
you know,
but news is almost always negative and 

2433
01:58:45,281 --> 01:58:48,280
so you know,
it's calling even calling it the news.

2434
01:58:48,281 --> 01:58:49,810
Like what does that mean?
News,

2435
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:51,640
what's news?
This shit happen hours.

2436
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:54,010
It's not news.
This is just events.

2437
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:56,140
It's like the show is events,
but what,

2438
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:57,003
what,
what dallas is doing is showing people 

2439
01:58:58,901 --> 01:58:59,734
that there's another path and in his,
his yoga program and just how positive 

2440
01:59:05,771 --> 01:59:08,200
and energetic that guy is.
It's contagious,

2441
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:10,390
you know,
and having him on the podcast man,

2442
01:59:10,391 --> 01:59:11,224
the number of fucking messages that I 
got afterwards of how many people that 

2443
01:59:13,931 --> 01:59:14,764
have benefited and how many people 
started taking this program and started 

2444
01:59:17,021 --> 01:59:21,340
taking his yoga or any yoga and cleaning
up their life and just inspired by it.

2445
01:59:21,341 --> 01:59:22,680
It's amazing,
you know,

2446
01:59:22,690 --> 01:59:27,690
that makes me very happy when I can help
a guy spread that kind of word that,

2447
01:59:28,311 --> 01:59:29,920
that makes me very happy.

2448
01:59:30,650 --> 01:59:32,220
Yeah.
I just want to get out there.

2449
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:36,960
I've chosen this platform of doing these
shows and building so you know,

2450
01:59:36,961 --> 01:59:40,020
because you wouldn't do me any good to 
be in the building where there's 5,000

2451
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:42,950
people because I can't spend time with 
each one of you,

2452
01:59:43,470 --> 01:59:44,303
but if it's a 150 in a comedy club will 
be five or 10 people that want to talk 

2453
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:51,390
about 150.
I got time for that.

2454
01:59:51,740 --> 01:59:53,440
Yeah.
If it was $5,000,

2455
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:57,450
I'd be overwhelmed because not because 
of the show shows easy.

2456
01:59:58,370 --> 01:59:59,203
He's just fucking memories.
I'll pull it out and had some jingles 

2457
02:00:01,890 --> 02:00:02,780
for it around,
you know,

2458
02:00:02,820 --> 02:00:06,270
say a couple of cute things and I'm not 
getting to them.

2459
02:00:06,271 --> 02:00:06,820
That's,
you know,

2460
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:07,740
that's,
that's my,

2461
02:00:07,950 --> 02:00:11,580
that's where I wanted,
you know,

2462
02:00:11,581 --> 02:00:12,414
when it's been a good show,
when I go and talk to a couple people 

2463
02:00:15,450 --> 02:00:17,240
and I can go back to the hotel room and 
just like,

2464
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:20,003
which is basically the opposite of how 
you would go back to a hotel room when 

2465
02:00:22,621 --> 02:00:23,454
you were wrestling.

2466
02:00:23,910 --> 02:00:26,040
Yeah.
I want to forget now.

2467
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:31,290
Right now I'm doing shit to forget about
and you can go back and chill.

2468
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:34,110
I can go back and smile.
That's beautiful.

2469
02:00:34,140 --> 02:00:34,920
Yeah.
I'm getting the,

2470
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:36,420
you know,
I'm hoping that,

2471
02:00:37,110 --> 02:00:39,000
you know,
I've,

2472
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:39,893
I've,
I've had enough miracles happened to me 

2473
02:00:41,731 --> 02:00:42,564
in the past four years to believe that 
there's still one more miracle left for 

2474
02:00:47,101 --> 02:00:50,940
me and I hope the hell I meet her soon 
because I don't want to.

2475
02:00:50,941 --> 02:00:52,320
I don't want to be alone anymore.
Man.

2476
02:00:52,940 --> 02:00:53,773
You see,
I dish up that stupid and I'm going to 

2477
02:00:55,621 --> 02:00:58,410
tell you guys made a lot of you guys 
listening and all was like,

2478
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:00,630
come on jake,
you're killing my buzz man.

2479
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:03,180
Well maybe I am and I'm going to tell 
you something guys.

2480
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:10,120
A woman is a great thing to have,
but you can't have too much than to have

2481
02:01:11,281 --> 02:01:12,114
too many.

2482
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:15,780
I know.
I experienced that.

2483
02:01:16,740 --> 02:01:17,573
I went from a small town kid and 
gainesville taxes where if you got laid 

2484
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:26,650
twice in a month by two different girls,
yours,

2485
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:29,073
you're the man and the double standards 
that we have for women that if a woman 

2486
02:01:33,811 --> 02:01:35,970
goes out and gives,
she's not a stud,

2487
02:01:35,971 --> 02:01:38,910
she's a whore.
WHat the fuck's wrong with that?

2488
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:41,900
It's us.
Well,

2489
02:01:41,901 --> 02:01:46,901
jake went from small town to a bigger 
city star.

2490
02:01:48,380 --> 02:01:50,030
Oh my god.
You named the price.

2491
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:52,220
You make it nice.
Hey girl,

2492
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:55,160
why don't you and your girlfriend come 
do a little show for me.

2493
02:01:55,310 --> 02:01:56,540
Use this toy,
that toy,

2494
02:01:56,541 --> 02:02:00,050
this toy bringing the dog or comes to 
the clown because that's what it got.

2495
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:05,480
It was never enough.
It had to be one more idea.

2496
02:02:05,481 --> 02:02:10,481
One more goofy thing to do as a girl or 
one more sexual position or how many can

2497
02:02:11,001 --> 02:02:13,460
you do in one night?
What'd you do with the donkey?

2498
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:14,923
It's a joke,
bro.

2499
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:18,860
We're friends.
We have dictionaries or I can anyway,

2500
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:24,910
but other words I couldn't fuck no more 
because now I've got a problem.

2501
02:02:27,170 --> 02:02:28,003
What's the problem?
It takes some pretty weird shit to get 

2502
02:02:30,411 --> 02:02:31,520
my fucking brain busy.

2503
02:02:33,620 --> 02:02:36,530
I went from heaven,
that diva at home,

2504
02:02:36,531 --> 02:02:41,531
that foxy hot.
Most I could ever want to.

2505
02:02:43,650 --> 02:02:46,110
having to get my shots.
Shots,

2506
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:47,133
shots of testosterone so I can pray to 
get a hard on for because there's not 

2507
02:02:53,131 --> 02:02:56,170
all this outside stuff going into the 
night.

2508
02:02:57,700 --> 02:02:58,533
Fucking kidding me.
You can't get your take are for this 

2509
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:04,480
motherfucker over here.
Then that would do anything for you.

2510
02:03:04,481 --> 02:03:05,740
Love you.
Everything,

2511
02:03:06,290 --> 02:03:09,770
but it also had to probably have to do 
with all the years of doing steroids.

2512
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:11,313
Your will.
Your body doesn't produce testosterone 

2513
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:16,070
the same anymore.
if you do the years of steroids.

2514
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:17,233
Yeah,
well I can still get the woodman and he 

2515
02:03:18,171 --> 02:03:21,260
brought the donkey and fucking wood all 
day long.

2516
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:23,630
The extreme excitement,
but that might be part of the issue.

2517
02:03:23,631 --> 02:03:24,950
The excitement was

2518
02:03:27,070 --> 02:03:29,020
having a door.
You can make them do anything you want.

2519
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:31,480
Right.
That's the kitchen on healthy,

2520
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:34,590
right?
That's very unhealthy is the kink.

2521
02:03:34,700 --> 02:03:38,530
Exactly.
So you got our to into the kink and then

2522
02:03:38,531 --> 02:03:41,530
regular stuff wasn't stimulating.
Get me happy.

2523
02:03:42,590 --> 02:03:45,160
He as the old joke about the couple that
are embedded going,

2524
02:03:45,161 --> 02:03:46,090
what's wrong honey?
We can't.

2525
02:03:46,150 --> 02:03:48,760
You can't fuck anybody else either.
Fuck.

2526
02:03:48,761 --> 02:03:50,530
you know,
you're trying to think of somebody.

2527
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:52,720
You get your shit going.
She's trying to think of somebody to get

2528
02:03:52,721 --> 02:03:55,120
her shit going.
You're both living a fucking lie.

2529
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:57,850
But I had to abstain from sex

2530
02:03:59,890 --> 02:04:04,890
for several years to get the fire back.
Fire his back.

2531
02:04:07,210 --> 02:04:11,720
Nobody wants to put it out.
You can find a gal,

2532
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:15,560
a gal,
a woman.

2533
02:04:15,770 --> 02:04:16,940
He's available.
Women,

2534
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:18,380
not girls.
Girls.

2535
02:04:18,381 --> 02:04:21,800
Stay home on a woman.
I'm going to experience.

2536
02:04:21,890 --> 02:04:23,660
I'm going to hook you up on a date with 
my mom.

2537
02:04:23,661 --> 02:04:26,820
If I can get Jake the snake.
If I can get jake the snake,

2538
02:04:26,821 --> 02:04:27,654
they'd be my stepdad.
My life's complete for penis is bigger 

2539
02:04:30,351 --> 02:04:33,350
than yours.
I'll take her probably is okay,

2540
02:04:34,130 --> 02:04:35,870
and she has a pet donkey,
so.

2541
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:36,873
Right,
but we're going to fix that back in one 

2542
02:04:42,391 --> 02:04:43,224
moment.
And you want any dating apps or 

2543
02:04:44,011 --> 02:04:44,930
anything?
No problem.

2544
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:45,803
No,
no.

2545
02:04:45,850 --> 02:04:47,290
You don't do that shit,
right?

2546
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:48,733
Well,
you don't want an old fashioned girl 

2547
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:50,833
fashion way.
You just put it out there in the 

2548
02:04:52,051 --> 02:04:54,570
universe right now to millions of 
people.

2549
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:57,240
So what's going to happen is at your 
shows,

2550
02:04:57,270 --> 02:04:59,610
and we'll get a lot of bullshit that I 
don't want to know.

2551
02:04:59,611 --> 02:05:00,444
This is going to be these gals and think
I'm the one gentleman help right now

2553

ready for jake.

2554
02:05:10,831 --> 02:05:11,340

Yeah.
Do you check your inbox inbox?

You got to be careful with the ones,

MosT of those bitches are fake.

2561
02:05:24,610 --> 02:05:25,443
If you go to their pages and there's 
only two photos and none of them have 

2562
02:05:27,311 --> 02:05:30,340
any text in them,
don't get suckered.
