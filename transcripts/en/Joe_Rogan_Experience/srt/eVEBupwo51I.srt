1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,520
One. Huh, Huh. Huh?

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,030
Oh boy. Hey everybody. What
the fuck's going on? Hey,

3
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:12,760
I've been away a while, but I missed you
guys. How long have you been away for?

4
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:17,060
Four days or something. They
took a week off. I was, uh,

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,700
I was out of town.
Um,

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,370
this episode of the podcast is
brought to you by Squarespace. Uh,

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,420
there's probably about five
or six websites out there
dedicated to various parts

8
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:32,310
of our body that have been made during
the construction of this very podcast.

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,680
It's that easy to make websites.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,910
Squarespace a allows you to
make your own website, um,

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,520
with just simple web tools, drag
and drop interface. Very easy to do.

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,130
It's nothing complex. It's
nothing that, uh, the average, uh,

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,660
dim wit that knows a little bit
about computers like myself can do.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,630
It's just they've figured it out.
They figured out how to streamline it.

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,990
Now with Dan, just drag and drop.
Everything's drag and drop. It says what?

16
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:58,980
It puts stuff. Yeah. And you can
make websites that look really good.

17
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,580
It used to be fully, yeah, I like
a different looking portfolio.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,030
How about this online store set
up an online store, super easy,

19
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,740
beautiful design for you to start with.

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,150
Use Your own images or handbags or
she could still pictures of your Dick

21
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,570
mentioned that you guys made a
living selling pictures. You Dick,

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,670
your wife just takes pictures of his
Dick and sells him a little bit of mouth.

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,780
Not Bad,
but I'm an excellent photographer.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,200
If it was real easy to buy shit online,
if everything was like Amazon one click,

25
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,670
you know, and I landed on the pay
like 5 cents to see your Dick. I know,

26
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,560
you know for people. Yeah.
People would. People would say,

27
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:35,520
I want to see Ariz tick this. A
few people that would, right? Yeah.

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,630
Like saying about how much like
let's get weird. Ellen degenerates.

29
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:43,110
If Ellen degenerate took pictures
of her butthole and he needed,

30
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,210
it costs you 5 cents to see it.

31
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,670
How many fucking people would pay if
it was really easy to pay that for?

32
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,390
For her vagina.
I think it's going to come to that.

33
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,210
If I didn't have to open
my wallet. Yeah. If you,

34
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,140
if it was super easy to do her like
it was just the back from a dollar,

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,550
it was just a word interface. Like do
you want to pay 5 cents to see Ellen's?

36
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:03,390
Yeah,
I'll see.

37
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:08,060
I'll do it and the computer knows and I'll
have it back to pretend. Yeah, and you,

38
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,970
you're allowed to not even take like a
breathalyzer test for anything under a

39
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:14,850
certain amount of money after
a certain amount of money.

40
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,390
It should be like the responsibility of
the manufacturer of the cell phone to

41
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,420
make some sort of a breathalyzer thing
because otherwise it's too fucking easy

42
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:25,020
to just buy shit. If you're
really hammered and you buy
something, buy everything.

43
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,080
Yeah, it's rude. You can't have that
pill and call him that for a long time.

44
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,690
Breathalyzer for your,
for your phone or your computer.

45
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,720
It's a good move for text messages and
the thing that you sent after two o'clock

46
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,610
in the morning.
It's most likely a mistake.

47
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,440
Most likely when I get to high late at
night, I buy so much things. Of course.

48
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,230
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful and awesome,

49
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,900
and you can make a website about
those things. Start Your own business.

50
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:48,000
You fuck resell your shitty purchases.

51
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,520
Go to squarespace.com you
can make your logo creator.

52
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:55,521
You can create a sleek and simple logo
for Ari and I doing that big juicy hog

53
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:59,980
Ari Shaffir, a big juicy hog
and it's a picture of a chicken.

54
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,080
It makes zero sense and it's perfect.

And for a free trial and
10% off your first purchase,

57
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,440
they're all different. Oh, that just
a minute. Are you sure? What is it?

58
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:19,190
The tee shirts and big juicy, juicy
y'all. It's an h AWG core science.

59
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,990
That's the way to say it.

60
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,400
Sounds more delicious that we start
with how it sounds or slurpee.

61
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,411
It's online.

62
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:29,530
Then it be getting mad at all of
these gay and you windows and jokes.

63
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:33,640
You rule this spool and homophobic
shit and all this folk and listen.

64
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,560
I like Dick Jokes. I think they're
funny. If you get, you get weirded out,

65
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:42,730
that's your own shit, son. All right,
don't panic. Dick. Jokes are funny.

66
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,380
Go to squarespace.com make
your room Dick joke website.

67
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,640
One cool thing about it though, one cool
thing about it covert Joe is that, um,

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,270
you could actually build the site and
then not pay for it yet and then decide

69
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,460
like, all right, I'm going to go
like, yeah, that is a good word.

70
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,800
That is a good a idea.
Rather they,

71
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,700
they're so confident in their ability to
make a website so easily that they let

72
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,511
you try it out,

73
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,060
register and try it out without
entering your credit card information.

74
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,051
So at the end of that,

75
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:13,051
if you'd like you websites wax on
whale and you can just bail and uh,

76
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,450
you'll have learned about
that surface anyway,

77
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,910
go to squarespace.com use the
code word Joe and save 10% off.

78
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:21,880
And more importantly to me, I meant the
Squarespace people. They're very nice.

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,570
They're cool. Where'd you meet him in
New York? I'm in New York or whatever.

80
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,550
The officer's super friendly.
Everybody that they came to the show,

81
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:31,490
they're really friendly and nice and fun
though. Okay. Internet company, man. Yeah,

82
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,880
it's cool people.
Those are the cool people.

83
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,910
That's why I have faith in the
future. People are always like, well,

84
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:38,630
here's uhthe you fucking yours.
Looking at the word toad things, man,

85
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,850
we're going down the toilet.

86
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,950
I have faith in the future because I
think that technology and the technology

87
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,860
creators are the ones that are
dictating what's taking place.

88
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,750
Everyone is scrambling to deal with the
technology owners. Innovators, yeah.

89
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,660
Before,
well instead of actual products,

90
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:59,980
solid items instead of solid items and
things that you weigh and put it on a

91
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:03,190
scale and said you're dealing with
things like a Google. I mean it's,

92
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,260
there's a solid item somewhere.
You know,

93
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:08,500
there's hard drives that keep all the
information on and obviously there's

94
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:09,334
offices,

95
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,540
but the reality is that Google is not
a real product that you can pick up and

96
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,900
having your hand. You can have a Google
phone, but what the fuck is Google? Well,

97
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,880
the number one thing in that company is
that nothing. It's an air. It's an idea.

98
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,530
So this idea has picked up all these
hard drives and set up all these web

99
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:31,210
browsers and set up all these different
Google chrome and Google operating

100
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:34,570
system based on nothing. But what
is it really? It's just ideas.

101
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,340
It's an idea is what Google is and
there are really ethical and responsible

102
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:43,600
company, which is fascinating
because one of the most powerful,

103
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,930
one of the Mo is also very progressive.
There's super progressive,

104
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,130
I have a friend who works at Google.

105
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,670
There's a guy who works in the office
who's a guy outside the office,

106
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:54,970
but in the office he likes to be referred
to as a woman and he dresses up as a

107
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:59,150
woman. So he goes to the office,
he dresses up as like, like a man,

108
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,450
just like a woman.
He's a man until he gets to the office.

109
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,680
Then he goes to the office at
work. Yup. Yup. Like Klinger.

110
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,340
He just knows he's not trying to
get a thing from the government.

111
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,930
It's just what he does. And Google's
like, okay, as long as you're nice,

112
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,870
like long as you did your work and
what do we care? What do we care?

113
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,400
That's perfect. This easy that
didn't exist in older, older.

114
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,230
Why does he wear a regular boy suit
to work? That's a very good question.

115
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:29,220
But a better question is why does anybody,

116
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,080
why can you identify someone
sex by the clothing they wear?

117
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:36,370
That seems like the most ridiculous thing.
Which people in a certain ways a bank.

118
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,680
Yeah.

119
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,250
I used to when I was religious and worked
at some law firm for the summer and

120
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,870
then the next year I
like lost my religion.

121
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,890
Then that summer and then I worked there
again like a goddamn rem song and I

122
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:48,560
didn't want to explain to them.
So I would just take my Yamaha off.

123
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,370
As soon as I left work I would
put it on to work and take it off.

124
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,690
So yeah, man, um, I,

125
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,300
I have faith because of that,
because he's smart.

126
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:03,170
Mother fuckers are the ones that are
the ones that are the most innovative,

127
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,660
the ones that are the most on the
cutting edge of about what's changing the

128
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:09,440
world. Like Google searches or changing
the goddamn world. Right. And then China,

129
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,860
you can't get on Google. It's
Google is a crazy thing. Yeah.

130
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,990
The ability to just get all the
questions. I mean, not always, right.

131
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,520
A lot of contrary information,

132
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:23,420
but just the sheer bulk of the
information and then sources, oh,

133
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:27,710
this is a Stanford University study,
and he'd go, okay. You know? Right.

134
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,680
You know what I mean? You just start
reading things like, oh, this, uh,

135
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:35,330
this guy's a professor of astronomy from
Cambridge, and he says this knowledge.

136
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,400
Yeah. You Go, okay, well,
this guy's super legit.

137
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:42,050
He's a professor of astronomy
at Cambridge. You know?
It's like that didn't,

138
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,093
we didn't have,

139
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,650
all you have is a microfiche for
newspapers and all these dudes that are in

140
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:50,450
involved in these companies.
In my opinion, it seems to
be they're moving. I mean,

141
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:52,340
it's, there's still, corporations
are still going to be,

142
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,590
there's always going to be
weirdness when money's involved,

143
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,810
but it seems like the
ethic of the Internet,

144
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,370
the ethic of these electronic corporations
is one of social responsibility.

145
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,660
One that didn't really exist before.
I'm trying to think of as any bad,

146
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,190
bad of those companies.
Not that I can think of like Tesla.

147
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,720
They're supposed to be really cool.

148
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,130
Elon Musk has got a reputation of being
is really fascinating. Innovative guys.

149
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:17,210
Starbucks is cool.
Starbucks is cool as fuck.

150
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:21,170
I love having good coffee on the
corner for people's health insurance.

151
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,180
They offered to put your through Phoenix
online college. Daily checkup. Yeah.

152
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:29,420
24 25 like we'll pay for it to full.
That's beautiful.

153
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,040
I think that shit is possible,
man.

154
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,960
I think people can build it and
the ethical competent, you know,

155
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,520
I can't really do, I just think that for
so long people are so God damn ruthless.

156
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,450
So people say, Ooh, you know, you
was fucking sue up and history.

157
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,680
They've been doing it for years.
Yeah.

158
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,540
Ben and Jerry had been doing it like I
Richard back before. It was interesting.

159
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,850
Like we're just going to do
it cause it's the right thing.

160
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,410
Well they're from Vermont. Vermont is,
if you ever been up there at Burlington,

161
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:54,530
Vermont. Oh yeah. Once my parents
tried to send me to a special camp.

162
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:58,530
They're so beautiful. Beautiful
Town. God, Vermont is awesome.

163
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,110
This is higher ground.
Ready to go to that higher ground place.

164
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,760
What's higher ground? Some like small
like rock theater. Ooh, like hers. Cool.

165
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,990
Maybe I worked at,

166
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,010
cause I definitely work something
in Burlington a long time ago. Yeah,

167
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:14,790
I guess we're doing a podcast. Let's
just fucking go with it. Um, uh,

168
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,350
I did something in Burlington. We, I mean
clearly we were done with commercials.

169
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,680
Nature's box yet. Yeah. Naturebox go
fuck yourself. Give me some yummy treats.

170
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Do you have,
where are they going to stop?

171
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,160
Because I was going to say I
actually made a Squarespace a store.

172
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:34,450
I'm working on one right now and it
was so fucking easy how you just put a

173
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:37,720
picture in of what you want to sell.
You put how many either is that quantity.

174
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:38,710
There is a,

175
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:42,130
you sign up for this thing that's like
paypal and then if somebody buys it from

176
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:45,910
you, it uh, autumn in two days it
automatically goes to your bank account,

177
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:50,911
the money and it sends you like a little
shipping thing where to ship it to you.

178
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,870
I mean it is incredible.

179
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:57,871
I was so blown away how easy a store
was because I knew blog kind of thing,

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,510
websites and stuff. I knew it couldn't
be that hard because I used wordpress,

181
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,940
this store thing. I was so amazed at how
easy it was, how much control you had.

182
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,150
And Squarespace I'm you can make a store
in less than five minutes is really

183
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:16,840
that crazy. Just like paypal
store. Did you use paper?

184
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,350
It uses a,

185
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:22,750
a another company that's just like how
I could just use a credit card so you

186
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:23,990
don't have to have a pig. Right, right.

187
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:25,650
So if someone has a paper
on the ones that's crazy.

188
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,740
It's just pretty much a credit card
processor that charges I think, uh,

189
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,840
like three, 5 cents per transaction. So,

190
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,120
and that's actually cheaper
than what paypal does.

191
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,990
Cause I believe paypal actually
uses a percent of how much money.

192
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:42,520
So if you have $100, paypal
takes like $11, you know,

193
00:10:42,521 --> 00:10:46,300
it's like 11% where this actual
company, whatever, I forget,

194
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:47,710
it's like spark or something.
Uh,

195
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,910
actually only just charges you 35
cents cause all it is is a credit card

196
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:53,090
transaction fee. Right, right.

197
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,060
So we're just moving numbers around in
the ether so we don't care how big your

198
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:59,040
transaction is. The same process
for them, right? A scam. Yeah.

199
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,180
Make money by moving numbers on computers.

200
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:06,310
Fucking ticket master always does that.
Garbage to Ticketmaster. Why is it on?

201
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,140
We bought four tickets all at once.
Why the four processing fee?

202
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,340
What's a processing fee? The computer's
doing it. He talking about it.

203
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:13,610
I didn't call the hotline.

204
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,260
Well that's what the big argument
with that band in Seattle was about.

205
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,550
Pearl Jam.
Pearl Jam.

206
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,810
Remember Pearl jam like they rallied
against ticket master and I talked to

207
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:24,890
someone over there and they were like,
no,

208
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:27,470
it's the venues that they
want their percentage that
they take it too. It's like,

209
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:30,230
well then why don't you put it as a
venue costs. We know who to blame.

210
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,130
Look at that face you're making.

211
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,850
Let's see your shows that people like
your tickets with $35 I paid 66 and you're

212
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:42,500
like, what? Yeah. Yeah. It's weird.
But that's how it is, you know,

213
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,110
I would love to rally
against shit like that,

214
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:49,010
but I don't have that kind of time so
I just got to keep pressing forward.

215
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,671
You know,

216
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:53,260
I think Louis for awhile I was doing some
weird shit where he's making people in

217
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:55,140
cash and they had,
yeah,

218
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,540
they had to buy it like the day of the
show and then a paint [inaudible] sir,

219
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,860
he did that at the comedy
store. I know that, you know,

220
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,480
the idea was to stop scalper suit because
there's always a scalping problem.

221
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,720
That's, that always happens if you're
going to sell out of place like uh,

222
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,280
like a ticket master. Um, like someone
who buys it from ticket master some,

223
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:13,860
you know, some company pops, whatever.

224
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,190
Long time ago Robin Williams played and
it was like sold out and I was like,

225
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:21,850
why didn't we get, people are offering
to pay like $150, $200 for tickets.

226
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,790
I'm like, what? We had access to
them. We never scalped at the store.

227
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,280
Somebody must've,
right.

228
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,490
Somebody must've gotten people like
chewy had to scalp a little bit.

229
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,343
I did it this year.

230
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,680
They just get some scalp and then
Louie tickets for for a few for you,

231
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,170
for someone else,
and then you couldn't go.

232
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,610
The other person couldn't get scalped
him. I told the doorman, I was like, Hey,

233
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,090
you can sell them, get whatever you want
over the 40 buck and then take the rest.

234
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,150
Ooh, he doubled it. Ooh. Yeah.
People can't get into like,

235
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:50,800
well, what do you want? What do you
want? Let's do this. Especially in La,

236
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,920
right in La.
People that come on,

237
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,480
this restaurant's got to have two seats
somewhere. I'm in fortunate paper,

238
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,680
Sean Paul on nine Dash Week.
Alright,

239
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,940
keep going with a commercial naturebox.
Naturebox.

240
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:07,990
Don't fuck.
Go Fuck Yourself.

241
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,480
When I said that before I was
treating you like a buddy,

242
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,920
I just got my first nature bucks
today. Man. I was really, really happy.

243
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,360
He just sent me two packages of
Serratia Kashi, so Roger Catches,

244
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,070
oh my goodness. I forgot
to bring them in, man.

245
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:24,010
I went home and I forgot to bring them
in. They're so good. You would die.

246
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,810
You would want them delivered
to your house every day.

247
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,920
Do the best snack I've
ever had. These Sharat your
cashews? Nope, that's not true.

248
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,020
I got some elk jerky from amazon.com
I know you can buy some elk Jerky,

249
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,690
so that's pretty God damn good too.
But a Sriracha cashews.

250
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,340
As far as like being a of an option where
nothing had to die. That's an animal.

251
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,610
A better for you than chips. Elk.
No, the chips. Oh yeah. Nuts.

252
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:50,680
You're way better than theirs either.
The salted and roasted and stuff.

253
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:53,990
It's still like these are,
that's what Scott would be
more easy to process, right?

254
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:54,791
It's definitely,
well,

255
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:58,060
what's more easy to process about
everything that naturebox has is that they

256
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:02,640
have no trans fats. Trans fats, your
body has a process issue with those. Uh,

257
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,970
high fructose corn syrup.

258
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,260
Nazi Holocaust survivors are living such
a long life because no high fructose

259
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:11,550
corn syrup, no trans fats for
awhile. That's what it is.

260
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,680
Yet another living at 100 and something
that's amazing. Imagine if that's true.

261
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,700
I can't pay that.
No imaginable.

262
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,570
Really blessed those foods. I the
GF food kosher, it's called kosher.

263
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,130
Don't take Jew food.
They look over and make sure you,

264
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,350
people like you aren't doing anything to
it. Of course, according to a license,

265
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,520
you're not supposed to say [inaudible]
you supposed to say Jewish.

266
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,270
And if you could say someone's a Jew
that it's like an insult. Really. No, no,

267
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:38,021
I've heard that before.

268
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:40,600
It's the first time I've actually
heard the girls say that according to a

269
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:45,500
license slash ginger, no, people would
get upset if you call someone a Jew.

270
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,210
Yeah. I, uh, zero,

271
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,200
zero high fructose corn syrup to a nothing
artificial free shipping anywhere in

272
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,070
the u s uh, if you, if you have a,

273
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:00,830
an office vending machine and they're
like the best thing that you can eat in

274
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:05,420
there as peanuts, you know those fucking
machines. What's this? Candy bar chips.

275
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,230
Peanuts,
I guess put some naturebox and your desk.

276
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:14,150
So Dropbox or Jews
always allowed to say that,

277
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:19,040
you know,
why do privilege privilege the animals?

278
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:19,491
And I was like,

279
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:22,580
that's kind of cool if just like this
old Jewish guy that came over there and

280
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:23,630
just like,
all right guys,

281
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,650
I look over the killing and they make
sure it's all killed, right? In theory,

282
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,990
I think that kosher was
a great idea at first.

283
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:33,440
They just set some ground rules like
don't eat pigs. They're dirty fuckers.

284
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:36,260
People were probably getting sick like
crazy if they didn't know how to cook

285
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:39,410
animals. If you cook a pig
the same way you kick a deer,

286
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:43,010
you're going to have real problems.
Uh, pigs are they, they're omnivores.

287
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,310
They eat a lot of animals and so they
get tricked Canosa so you have to get a

288
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:48,140
cook the shit out of it.

289
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,600
You gotta you're going to eat that
parasite to when you eat a pig that

290
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,560
they did not really know where to get
fucking try mushrooms and get sat from a

291
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:57,921
tree,

292
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:00,590
but they didn't know why do we keep
getting sick every time we get this pig?

293
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,740
Well, they just thought the pig was
disgusting. They thought if you eat pig,

294
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,530
you're going to get sick and you're
going to die. It makes sense cause back.

295
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,030
That is true. Yeah. I mean, back then
you had a real issue and most pigs,

296
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:14,750
whether they were wild or domestic,
apparently the exact same thing,

297
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,280
the same animal, just they
just look different, you know?

298
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,990
But they could fuck with each other.
They can interbreed you know,

299
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,760
it was a really weren't allowed
to accept when they said,

300
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:27,130
why is it tough not kosher?
Because you know, it's, it's
the tapeworm stuff. Mm. Uh,

301
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:31,000
the answer was always, cause God
said, that's a good mo. Good answer.

302
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:33,920
You're not supposed to know why. Yeah,
you don't need to know bitch. God said,

303
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,660
God said, stay away from the
fucking pigs. But, uh, you know,

304
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:42,440
now that we know it's silly because bacon
is awesome and nobody dies from Bacon,

305
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,740
Bacon today. I mean, you could buy
from, you could die from [inaudible].

306
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,240
How about some bacon flavor and stuff?
Do that beef Jerky in here?

307
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,530
They don't have beef jerky. No, but
I'll tell you what they do have.

308
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,440
They have those south Pacific plantations.
God Damn, those are good. Woo.

309
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,000
And that big island pineapple. Oh
Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. But I keep going.

310
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:05,760
Those Sriracha cashews, everything.
I didn't have any big unrelated,

311
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,670
now that I think about it,
they need

312
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,890
to ward off the juice.
Pickles,

313
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,610
pickles, a tricky man. You know
Grillo's pickles, by the way.

314
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,400
How's greatest pickles in the
history of the free world?

315
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,940
They don't need to make pickles.
When Grillo's pickles show up at,

316
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:26,060
they were just giving them out. What was
that was our show in Boston and Boston.

317
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:29,600
Yeah. The dude from Grillo's pickles,
cools, cools. Fucking Grillo's pickles.

318
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:32,180
I am not bullshitting you.
The best pickles I've ever had in my life.

319
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,460
People were like, what's the
big deal with pickles? Bitch,

320
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,840
listen to me just by yourself and
the one container of those hot,

321
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,860
spicy. Spicy. Yeah. Oh my
God, they're so fucking good.

322
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Big Island pineapple is all so delicious
that love that snack and nothing

323
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:50,080
simple, dried. So

324
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,780
good. And what's cool about
nature of boxes that you know you,

325
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:57,781
you get this once a month and you could
add any other snack for only $3 extra so

326
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,900
you can just load up your box.
Like I love it.

327
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,950
No problem. Don't go to nature's
box, naturebox, naturebox nature.

328
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,760
It's a chick named nature and uh,
it's, it's all boxes. Disgusting.

329
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,360
It's all about her. Her Butt
problem. Got One of those.

330
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,310
If you're doing ads on each of these
people ever save him for like [inaudible]

331
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,850
not really an ad. I mean there's
sort of a podcast ad. Yeah. Anyway,

332
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,440
naturebox.com/rogan socket, that's
enough. We don't need to do on it today.

333
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,020
We'll do it later on.com. Use
the code word Rogan Sam. Boom.

334
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:35,020
I move like a ghost
experience.

335
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,690
We said a lot of cool shit
before this podcast ever started.

336
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,130
We have a Nick Diaz calling through our
punchdrunk sports podcast. Oh really?

337
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:50,950
He's going to call in? Uh, well
we have allegedly, allegedly,

338
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,920
he calls it all the time. How did you do
punch drunk when you were on the road?

339
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,660
China. I love doing it from other
places. I did it from the slopes in Vail.

340
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:03,220
Was Holy Shit, I should have a guest or
did you do it by yourself? Punch drunk?

341
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,050
No, no, no. Like you called in
Skype. Okay, so you did it from,

342
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,060
from remote locations? Yeah,
from the slopes and veil.

343
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:13,930
Like I pulled over into the woods and I
was until my phone went off because it

344
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:17,170
was too cold. It's always
been like, where are you?

345
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,460
I did it from the shower once we came
back from break and I was just like and

346
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:23,620
see if I was like,
are you fucking showering?

347
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,220
What is the audio like when you're
skyping like into a podcast?

348
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,790
Pretty good as long as I have Wifi so
you could but you're trying to do it on

349
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,520
four g LTE and it works. Yeah,

350
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,360
but sometimes it goes like, especially
in New York, it's like comes in and out.

351
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,850
It seems like there would be a really
cool way to do a podcast walking around

352
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,813
AAA.

353
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,450
It's very like room echo,
Edo, that good part.

354
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:52,870
What you could do though is you could
record it separately like on an MP three

355
00:19:52,871 --> 00:19:55,900
player and then send them the audio
later and they could cut it in.

356
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:56,930
So it sounds fun.

357
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,370
Have two recordings going simultaneously
and they would have to sync them up.

358
00:20:00,371 --> 00:20:01,890
Right.
The live one would be the only one there

359
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,380
that seems like a project that we would
give to you and it would take at least a

360
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,770
year
or two reasons why.

361
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,630
I know that that's not going to happen.
But I'm so happy.

362
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:17,860
Your video editing again,
that video of us shooting hard drives,

363
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:23,170
we just had to shoot hard drives.
Hard drives. Yeah. So we uh, you know,

364
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,020
that's funny.
No for fun than anything,

365
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,040
but I always wanted to know what
happens when a bullet hits a hard drive.

366
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,190
So all drives and load up my
hunting rifle. Really? Yeah.

367
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,990
It's a serious rifle. It's a seven
millimeter Remington ultra mag.

368
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:42,640
They just let go through it. Oh yeah,
yeah. It went through. It's sideways too.

369
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,480
Like it's, it's so accurate.
You could hit it with wise.

370
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,310
So you're at something that's

371
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,100
a hundred yards away and
you have about an inch,

372
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,500
maybe a little more inch and a half or
some points that you can see. This is a,

373
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,880
this is us shooting that the heart

374
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,400
drive,
as long as you stay put,

375
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,380
it's all just about staying put and
not freaking out. Freaking out. Yeah.

376
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,830
When you pull the trigger,
don't flinch.

377
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,770
It's really hard not to flinch
because you got a rifle man

378
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,420
gun rifle breathe out. Yeah. I mean that
thing that has a muzzle break on it,

379
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:19,510
which is this thing around the
tip of the uh, the rifle bolt,

380
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,460
the a rifle barrel rather that
it distributes the energy better.

381
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,400
Makes a louder noise though.
So it doesn't,

382
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:32,200
it's a hundred yards and it does so
it doesn't, um, it doesn't, um, uh,

383
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,190
kick as much,

384
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,520
which is really important because of the
kick is what scares the shit out of Uli.

385
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,720
Yeah. Clinch up before it
happens. Yeah. Tense up.

386
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,850
How do we get to talking
about this hard drive?

387
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:46,600
Destruction were we were on a
Securitas route. Oh, your video.

388
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:51,280
I'm glad you're doing video.
Yeah, man, it's so cool to
see you doing videos again.

389
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,380
Somebody put up a thread of
some of your old videos. Dude,

390
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,210
you're so talented at that. It's like
you have such a gift for video editing.

391
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,720
I quickly learned know how to,
how using like editing HD nowadays,

392
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:06,860
how much fucking computer you need
though to make it even worth not killing

393
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:08,730
yourself.
Trying to do as far as,

394
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,000
well I don't just edit videos like that.
The videos I do,

395
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,360
there's like at least that had like at
least 12 layers of audio going on at the

396
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:18,040
same time.

397
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,790
Is there some sort of super dope set up
that we can get that would convince you

398
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:22,624
to start making money?

399
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,790
Well, I mean this, I mean this one was fun
to do but it, you know, I don't know. I

400
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,500
dude, you could make the, you make,
you were making amazing videos,

401
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,770
submission video for some, some strong
comments. That should never happen. Yeah,

402
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,520
it has like a million views are, I'm
rolling. It has a lot and I was like, wow,

403
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:42,450
I got that man know you've
got some real talent,

404
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,150
real talent as far as like how you choose
scenes and edit things and music and

405
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:49,160
effects into them.
You're really good.

406
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:52,340
It's like you don't just take a video
and cut it together and edit it.

407
00:22:52,341 --> 00:22:54,860
You add something to it. You
add a lot to it. You know,

408
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:57,800
you made some awesome videos when we
were working together. Doing those.

409
00:22:57,801 --> 00:22:59,900
Taylor always looked good.
David Taylor says that he was like,

410
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,220
you're the first guy to figure out length
on the Internet without Mitzia clip.

411
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,730
It'll like, how do you make a 10 minute
long clip? But people will actually watch.

412
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,180
There's no way. It hasn't been naked
like a show. Make it look a little show.

413
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:14,750
You have a timeline going on. I mean it
goes back in time and forward in time.

414
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,130
Nowadays it is getting easier.

415
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:22,060
The actual programs like the new final
cut pro is cool cause it could sync up

416
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,360
automatically where it used to have to
just try to line up to yeah, yeah it

417
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,080
was. And stuff like that. Go go to
saint. Wow. That should be a thing. Yeah.

418
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:36,170
Jama computers into this man.
I mean it would be fun to see how,

419
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:39,570
how much unstressful some Adderall.

420
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:43,470
We'll get you whatever you allegedly
allegedly, this is a comedy show.

421
00:23:43,471 --> 00:23:47,790
We're not being do. Take us to a cage
out of all that motherfucker up. Yeah.

422
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,930
That was talking, working, talking. Dude,
dude today, recently quit Adderall. Right.

423
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,800
Really? Yeah. We're having a conversation
while, you know, he was cool. He ran out.

424
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,320
Very cool guy. No, I
think he felt like that.

425
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,890
I think a lot of people that do the
Adderall feel like there's a crash at the

426
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,490
end of the day.

427
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,070
Oh you got to have the inside of the fast
acting ones or the time release ones.

428
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,800
Yeah. So there was no crash that way.
Is it like they slowly lead you off,

429
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,890
boom and drop off a cliff. But he was
loving the Adderall. I got to get us on.

430
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,240
He was telling me how productive and
really cause he self medicating that one.

431
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,850
I do not believe so,
but I didn't ask.

432
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,090
I believe he was talking about a doctor.

433
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,900
It works so much differently when you're
like can need it or when you don't.

434
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,400
It feels like the opposite thing to
you if you need it. Allegedly. Uh,

435
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,770
I don't understand add, but if
you, cause I have it hardcore,

436
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,480
I don't understand it, but I think if
you, um, if you have it and then you take,

437
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:45,770
it calms you. It centers you. Is that
true though? I Dunno. That's what I heard.

438
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:50,180
I don't know. I have no, it's so hard
to tell what the fuck is going on.

439
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,950
It's like you ever, uh, see someone
drink and then they just lose their moms.

440
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,050
They just, for whatever reason,
they just lose their marbles.

441
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:01,070
The brain just shuts off.
They're not there anymore.
They make terrible decisions.

442
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:02,480
You're like,
how many fucking drinks have you had?

443
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:05,450
He's only had like three drinks and
they just go away. They just go away.

444
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,400
I can't get that. You don't get that? I
don't know. Just barf. Right. Pass out.

445
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:14,400
But I mean, do you get that guy? Oh,
understand it. Yeah. You tried to get,

446
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,440
do you try to get it, cause obviously
something's happening to him.

447
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,850
I think he's a very direct,

448
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,010
there's a distinctly different
physiological effect of
alcohol on his body as

449
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:28,250
opposed to your body. You and I have
gotten drunk a bunch of times together.

450
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:32,090
You just argue she feared drunk. Yeah.
You know, there's nothing crazy at all.

451
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:35,270
You're, you, you're exactly the same
guy, but you'll laugh a little bit more.

452
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,430
You sit,
you'll be a little bit more ridiculous.

453
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:39,080
Like all of us were drunk at looser,

454
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,550
but there are certain folks that they
go away and then this other guys there,

455
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,510
this is a love.

456
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:47,330
That's my favorite thing is to say like
they're not making memories right now.

457
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,570
Nope, this is all just unrecorded.
What's really fucked up?

458
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:55,571
It's like they're in a dream that's that's
there's people that have a real issue

459
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:59,540
like that. The sign of alcoholism, you
black out, that means you're an alcoholic,

460
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,900
but be like, what do you mean? I blacked
out like a hundred times. Like, yeah,

461
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,540
but there is something to say like I've
been freaking myself out because I mean

462
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:10,870
I like to drink,
but it seems like every night I come home,

463
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:14,530
like I don't remember the last hour like
at all, but then I'm thinking, wait,

464
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,210
I only had three drinks.
That's like,

465
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:21,040
I think there's also a lot to do with how
much you smoke weed, alcohol together.

466
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:25,400
Both jump off. Yeah, because
I know that's in both.

467
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,850
Like jumpstart it.

468
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,880
Like right now today I've only smoked
weed and I really don't remember what I

469
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,470
did last like two hours ago.
I,

470
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,990
I'm just trying to remember that you
didn't get much sleep last night either,

471
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:38,710
right? Yeah. Yeah. It happens a lot though
where like I come home and I'm like,

472
00:26:38,711 --> 00:26:43,060
well I don't remember much last
night but I smoked like 14 joints.

473
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,040
Smoking

474
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,870
14 joints is probably a bad idea,

475
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,170
but what's a good idea for
you is definitely to take
a break off the booze and

476
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,740
that's this week cause you're,
you're healthy.

477
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,770
I mean look what you did with your life
as far as like have fun over the last

478
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,560
few years. Go Party, you know, just
be at the comedy clubs all the time.

479
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:04,530
It's a great fun thing that's
so few people get to do.

480
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,030
There's nothing wrong with doing it.

481
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,370
It's like do you do it and manage how
much damage you do to yourself in the

482
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:13,020
process and a certain point in time.

483
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,070
I just feel that most
folks can't keep drinking.

484
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,500
Most folks to get to a
certain point in time.

485
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,220
There's always stories about
some guy was a hundred years old,

486
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:26,340
smoked cigarettes and, but that guy,
the reason why you hear those stories,

487
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,010
that's unusual as fuck. Most people
when they get to be, you know,

488
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,770
50, 60, when they're smokers,

489
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,210
they start having real problems,
like extreme problems.

490
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,450
She throws, her grandfather drank
every day until he died. I'm like,

491
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:44,100
how often does your hanging
out with her grandfather,

492
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,770
he's over there and check it off
and eat and tobacco. Yeah, there's,

493
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,500
I don't know how much of it is true.
You know,

494
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:56,650
I know there's always a guy that lives
to be a hundred and a guy that uh,

495
00:27:56,651 --> 00:27:58,980
you know, smoked all the time and he was
fine until the day he died, you know,

496
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:03,720
whatever. But I know people that
I've seen their body deteriorate.

497
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,430
I've seen there, I've seen their face
start to like shrivel in cigarettes.

498
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,590
You know that weird thing you do when you,

499
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,220
when a guy's a chain smoker and you start
to see their face starts to shrivel in,

500
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,670
gets hardened to itself.
Right?

501
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,900
I look gray outside all the
time though to a leather face.

502
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:28,150
That beach face, you gotta be
outside smoking but just it's,

503
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,530
I, I know several people have died
because of the cigarettes. Several.

504
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,690
The first was a, a guy that I knew. Um,

505
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,010
well I guess I don't have any
relatives that died from it, but uh,

506
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:41,040
I knew a guy who was a at the pool hall,
used to hang out with.

507
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,840
He died slow cancer. Yeah, he died
slow. Got James Three guys there.

508
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:48,990
I knew three guys there that died from
cigarettes that had that smoke cigarettes

509
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,910
everyday chain smoked and
they got cancer and died.

510
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,150
Is anyone in your family
smoke? No, not anymore.

511
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,070
But my sister smoked for a little while
and my mom smoked for a little while ago.

512
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,170
You could probably smoke for a good 20
years if you want it. I'm not into it.

513
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,820
Thanks though. Just try
it. It's probably okay.

514
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,270
Probably like, I mean are you, you have
to admit you used to enjoy smoking. Oh,

515
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:13,980
I loved it. Are you kidding me and China.
I was thinking like I got the urge back.

516
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,440
Ooh. Cause everybody smokes over
there, right? Everyone gets folks,

517
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,320
maybe it's a pollution. So I was already
feeling it a little too. Just feel it.

518
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,160
You got, did you get close
to saying fuck it? No,

519
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,930
I was looking at people
with their cigarettes going,

520
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,160
do you think that you could smoke for
like a week and then not get hooked again?

521
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:32,880
They decide, no, I think I'm
to two cigarettes. I'm fully,

522
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,270
oh my goodness. One is still, I
can still like that was disgusting,

523
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:37,950
but you know what it might be discussing,

524
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:40,320
but if it does then it starts
going away through your body,

525
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,850
just moving and then the next day
you'd be like, yeah, I need one.

526
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:47,950
I really wish I understood addiction.
I had a guy on the year, Dr. Carl Hart,

527
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,930
who explained addictions to me,

528
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:54,010
but when you're talking to a guy super
smart and knows a lot about the human

529
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:56,950
body and the mechanisms of addiction,
and he's explaining to me,

530
00:29:56,951 --> 00:30:00,340
I'm hearing the words he's saying and I
get what he's trying to explain to me,

531
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,540
but I totally understand the mechanisms
of how these addictions work.

532
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,373
I don't understand it,

533
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,100
but the way he was saying it was
that it's more mental than anything.

534
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,280
It's more people just, it's in their
mind, the actual physical addiction.

535
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,930
He said it's not that big of a deal.

536
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,830
Like the people that get their couches
and stuff that's usable couches. Yeah.

537
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,920
You know, those weird addictions, people
eat 30, the couch cushion out. Oh,

538
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:24,130
a little bit of time. I just haven't
seen that. I saw chicken was eating tape.

539
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,750
She was addicted to eat and tape. She
would pull the plastic tape, break it off,

540
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:32,740
but her mouth and start chewing it.
So there's nothing chemical to that.

541
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,810
That's just mental.
That's crazy person.

542
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,370
That's just a hundred percent
crazy something. But that's
also an addiction. Yeah.

543
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,760
That's what's weird about being a
person. It's, there's all, there's,

544
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:47,590
there's addictions of, yeah, there's
like addiction, stop it that are, uh,

545
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,510
like there could just compulsive they,
they,

546
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:53,110
because they were habit for whatever
reason. You just feel the need to do it.

547
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,740
Yeah. And a cigarette apparently
is one of, it's a big one.

548
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,300
He food's a big one for some folks.

549
00:30:58,301 --> 00:31:01,090
It's the drive Thru that rush that you
get when you're not supposed to go to

550
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:03,280
that drive through, but
fuck it, let's do this.

551
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:06,480
And it's like you get an addiction
to had like a skydiving. Yeah.

552
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:10,450
Stopping an Arby's. Well, dude, I've had
that feeling. You've had that feeling too,

553
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:14,350
especially when you're drunk. Right. It's
just feel good to know you can get food.

554
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,380
Yeah. You're going to get
some delicious, delicious.

555
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,600
Remember when we still walked a carnies
right down the street from the store.

556
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,620
That's some of the worst shit you could
ever eat in your life. You know? So good.

557
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,710
So good. I had it like last year
again. Should never read it.

558
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,020
Every time I eat it, I was like, what
the fuck did I just do to my body?

559
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,310
No Food Pyramid where that's, yeah, you
get Chili fries on top of a Chili dog.

560
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,670
That's totally an addiction. Oh,
that place is an addictive place.

561
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,580
Those kinds of places are addictive
and great. Don't get me wrong.

562
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:45,040
I'm glad they exist. The race,
I would go there tomorrow.

563
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,710
I would go there tomorrow.
But

564
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,420
there's a certain addiction to that,

565
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:55,110
that this is very peripheral cause you're
not doing it all day every day like

566
00:31:55,111 --> 00:31:55,944
you can with cigarettes.

567
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,000
So I would imagine just the ritual
aspect of the tradition of the rituals.

568
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,700
What are the way bigger,
because you're doing it all day.

569
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,550
Something to do with your hands too.
Doing this all day.

570
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,370
It's nice to chew on cigarettes for years.

571
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,470
So when I'm sick of rights
the same six minutes,

572
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:16,870
it would've taken him to smoke it and
then throws it out and start to new one.

573
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,400
That's smart of him.

574
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,650
But then he started smoking again
and he starts smoking again.

575
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,230
But then one time they was a great story.

576
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,230
He threw one out and he started a new
one and he goes, what are you doing?

577
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,240
What are you doing?
Toothpicks or three 99 for a hundred

578
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,150
that's so dice. Then he would worry
about how much money spending.

579
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,220
I'm given these jerk offs.

580
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,620
He's got to get a special brand cigarette
that he wasn't even smoking for like

581
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:45,800
five years. There is something
very calming about it though.

582
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:49,970
Like when you're stressed or
if you're like, oh yeah, no,

583
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:54,830
no cigarette real. There's a
real effect. Here's what's crazy.

584
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:57,840
That real effect is just that
you're addicted to cigarettes now.

585
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:00,890
Nicotine is calming. It's
not though. It's a stimulant.

586
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,880
Nicotine is more of a
stimulant. I'm pretty sure. I
don't think it has a calming.

587
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:07,400
It's also tomsie because you're like,
oh, now I don't need a cigarette anymore.

588
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,080
Well let's Google that because we live
in 2014 and I might be totally wrong,

589
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:16,880
but the way it was explained to me
and the way Dr. Hart describes it,

590
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:17,181
is it,

591
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:21,950
what's going on is you have this buildup
in his need to get it in your body.

592
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,390
Then when you get into your body,

593
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,980
so that when you're in a situation
where you're very stressed out,

594
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,850
you absolutely have
extraneous external stress.

595
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,830
You are members of the fact
that you need a cigarette,

596
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,960
but maybe it's also seems like the
same feeling as when you get serious,

597
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,080
when you do actually get
stressed. It's like, Oh,

598
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:43,310
this reminds me of the time I should
have cigarettes. Yeah. And again,

599
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:46,090
I think what we talked
about earlier that the writ,

600
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,690
the daily ritual aspect of a cigarette
must be incredibly strong because you do

601
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:53,240
it so often,
especially if you have a drink.

602
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,640
How many people tell you they only smoke
when they drink a lot of people, right?

603
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,340
What is that? You know,
you're doing something bad.

604
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:00,690
It's the same thing as eating the
carnies. You know, you're gonna,

605
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,680
you know you're doing something bad and
you're like, fuck it. It's a ritual.

606
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:05,180
When I get drunk I like to do that.

607
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:10,010
It's like the flavor of coffee and
cigarettes together is like the best two

608
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:14,870
ingredients that make the best pie ever.
Yeah. Nicotine. Nicotine is a stimulant.

609
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,590
It was good. This is the, um,

610
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,440
the actual explanation
of what nicotine is.

611
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,940
Nicotine is a potent boy.
Here we go. Sim Path though.

612
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,160
Simpatico mummy. Hectic. That's my
middle name. Paris in path though.

613
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:35,960
Mimetic alkaloid found in the nightshade
family of plants and is a stimulant

614
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:38,730
drug. Nightshade. That sounds cool.

615
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,000
That's why people like to smoke
cigarettes after they fuck sell does it.

616
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,230
Hot Sauce. I was like a GI.
Jane said, Nico Teen, Nick,

617
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,210
a [inaudible] receptor and agonist.

618
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,740
It's made from the roots and
accumulates in the leaves of plants,

619
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,520
which is a obviously tobacco plant.

620
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,650
I think some other plants have nicotine
a lot of words in there. I didn't know.

621
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,140
Yeah,
I think you can get nicotine from,

622
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:06,290
I want to say guarana or it
might be something differently.

623
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,290
I met some of the different kinds of
[inaudible] you ever have that? Um,

624
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,820
Asai that's what that is. While
we're on it. Berries. Yeah.

625
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,950
I'm pretty sure it was also he guarana
at Cornell. It's, it's spelled different.

626
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:23,890
Right? How's it spelled? [inaudible]
how you spell it? ACI is Nigeria.

627
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:27,310
I'm going to play Jeremy Cai. That's,
and the jury going to play Germany? Yeah.

628
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,480
There's a black eye on the Nigerian
team. I mean on the, on the, you know,

629
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:35,030
a lot on the German team.
Well, I, what's so funny,

630
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,090
I just wondered,
um,

631
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:41,910
this Asa II stuff is so delicious,

632
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:44,430
but apparently when you get it in Brazil,

633
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,180
you get like the pure form event and a
lot of times what we get has a lot of

634
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:51,960
sugar in it.
Wonder who's got the best onsite,

635
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,860
but it's a so I'm wrong. It's not that
other fruit. What did I say it was?

636
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,233
What did I think it was?

637
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,330
Guarana Guarana I think guarana is a
totally different thing. Oh yeah, I know,

638
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:08,460
but it's a guarana is some sort of
stimulant. Go around is like caffeine.

639
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,710
You ever heard of that shit? That soda,
that Brazilian soda? I forbid a child.

640
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:18,300
You never had that green, that
green. Oh son. You missing out.

641
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,780
If you're going to go to Fogo de Chao
and have the full Brazilian experience,

642
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,440
you've got to get one of those Guarana
so sodas, I'm gonna go back to Brazil.

643
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:30,760
So go there or does though.
Yeah,

644
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:34,380
it sounds they have real photos.
They have the original photos in Rio.

645
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,520
Chicken hearts.
Yeah.

646
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,090
They have chicken hearts and Oregon's
and they love to eat like that. Man.

647
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:43,920
Those people love to eat like
that core. Ron Has Caffeine. Yes,

648
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:47,730
it does. Okay. Yeah, so that
stuff has caffeine in it.

649
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,640
That's what I was getting confused with.
So go Ron.

650
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:53,190
I'm pretty sure as it totally
different thing. I'll say. Yeah.

651
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:56,310
It doesn't even look like that.
I Sayi is those berries.

652
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,270
Anyway, the important thing is
keep smoking because it stimulates.

653
00:36:59,271 --> 00:37:03,440
You don't listen to these guys. They're
fucking with you, man. Don't do it.

654
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,190
I wonder how many people as we talked
about cigarettes at how bad they were,

655
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,510
got the urge and lit up. I'm
sure they did. They probably,

656
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,870
they're smoking right now. At least
sub cursing us. You know what? I wish,

657
00:37:11,871 --> 00:37:15,620
I wish I never smoked my whole life
and now my 40th birthday I would start

658
00:37:15,621 --> 00:37:17,180
smoking and he just,
cause who cares?

659
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,930
You know by the time you turn 40 who
cares if you get cancer? Oh my God,

660
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:25,270
you're so retarded. Would it be Ben,
why wouldn't it be when you're 43 okay.

661
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,080
I wonder about you sometimes.

662
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,890
Maybe that fucking computer sitting in
front of computer editing, just cooked.

663
00:37:30,891 --> 00:37:34,710
You ever think of that like radiation
and you're shit's not good for you.

664
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,170
Maybe you can do it from a
distance with a remote control or

665
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,510
dictate to things and you start looking
at things and overplaying stuff over and

666
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:49,511
over and over like three hours
in a row and you're just looking,

667
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:54,731
it's like a sign of being really in
love with what you're doing and we just

668
00:37:54,951 --> 00:37:57,860
really connected. You're obsessed
with your work? Yeah. Come on man.

669
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:01,430
You know that when you release those
really good ones and you got awesome

670
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:06,260
response online from people that just work
but universally on that message board,

671
00:38:06,261 --> 00:38:08,050
people talking about how great
your video editing skills.

672
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,220
Where I about it of those nights
where you're like, oh I'm sure. Yeah

673
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,370
they actually say that that is what's
happening. It's cooking your tear ducts.

674
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,610
Wow. Really? So there's something about
it like it dries out your tear ducts,

675
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:20,200
it's really bad for you.
I still cry.

676
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,040
Well I got a pair of
glasses and they're yellow.

677
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:28,930
They're supposed to cut down on the
glare. It's like less, less intrusive.

678
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,070
It's like shooting glasses.

679
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:32,170
They look just like this type of
glasses you wear on the range.

680
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,690
Cause like looking through
yellow is supposed to be like,

681
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,980
remember have those stupid fucking

682
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,520
commercials for those cheap
ass sunglasses. Steet glasses.

683
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,960
They're the best son goes around these.

684
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,770
What do you think of these
things so much clear. Wow. Yeah,

685
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,100
it's a girl wears them
and Tom, but really? Yeah.

686
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,240
Well those are the ones that you're
supposed to look at when you look at you

687
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,120
like that crazy vision and wraps around
my normal spectacles that God wants to.

688
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,020
There's a little window
on the side. Listen, Ari,

689
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,660
you got nothing to say to that guy.
Get Him.

690
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,290
What do you and him got
to talk about your next,

691
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,820
you're on a bus next to each other for
five hours. What do you do for a living?

692
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,840
I'm just the comic. Uh, where'd
you get those glasses? Oh,

693
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:20,230
these are my HD wrap arounds
as seen on TV. Oh really?

694
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,510
He's also as even your order from TV,

695
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,940
you allow me to see you in a
totally different light. Like what?

696
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,910
We're kind of like Jew.
You can see the hearts.

697
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,830
What is it like being a jail? Rawr.
What is it like? My favorite question.

698
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,150
My favorite stupid
question to ask somebody.

699
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:38,800
What is it like to whatever
you'd like to be fucking funny.

700
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,343
It's like eight.

701
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,930
What's it like to have those beautiful
wrap around yellow sunglasses?

702
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,200
It's like not having them, but
it's way better than that. Yeah.

703
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:54,640
People will say some weird shit to
people sometimes. What's it like? Yeah,

704
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:59,050
it must be nice.
You like what's like drinking a coca cola,

705
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,890
which you'd like to have him for?
What? Her brother? Her brother Ha.

706
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,120
What's it like? I don't know what it's
like to have him for her brother. Yeah.

707
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:10,330
It's like we're just lucky to
have her phone mom. Huh? Fuck Bro.

708
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,280
I guess the experiences, uh, yeah.

709
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,190
People say douchey things
like on the sneak tip,

710
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,410
they can see Douchey Shit
like that where you don't,

711
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:22,750
you're not supposed to get mad at them,
but you're allowed to anyway. It's like,

712
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:26,560
what the fuck you doing? Going nowhere.
You're wasting everyone's time.

713
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,780
What's it like to have her for a mom?
What the fuck?

714
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,440
I'm kind of questioning you
asking me bitch. Like that's
some weird person, right?

715
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,560
That's a person who's not nice.
They're being douchey with you.

716
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,060
Fuck come right.
Pac Sun Shit.

717
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,140
Did you follow that story about that
kidnapping of the kid that they found in

718
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,670
the hell?
Was that about which kit?

719
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:53,530
It's very suspect. Right. What
happened? Interviewed the Guy.

720
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:56,770
The father too. I guess last night I
didn't watch it, but I heard it was a,

721
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:02,270
you're trying to tell me that you didn't
look in the basement for your son and

722
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,820
he was in there for 11 days.

723
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:12,090
Is that what you're trying to tell me
sir and wasn't he like I just dead?

724
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,040
Huh? He was just trapped
in there. He was hiding.

725
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,960
Oh he apparently the official
story. He died. No, no,

726
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:22,330
he's alive. They went looking
for him for like 11 days.

727
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,800
The kid was in the basement the whole
time hiding behind some chuck dungeon.

728
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:31,300
He decided to make himself like a
little house back there. We had food.

729
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:33,980
There's clothes. Yeah. Obviously

730
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,630
there's something wrong,
you know?

731
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:39,170
I mean that doesn't seem like a normal
kid wants to be around their parents.

732
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,620
Right. You know, she just
don't usually want to hide.

733
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,210
These must be much more
than it. I mean 11 days. Oh,

734
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,060
I don't want any of this jacket. That's
no way because some kid hides for level,

735
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,110
something's wrong. Whatever
it is. Whoever did something,

736
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:52,400
it seems like something's wrong.

737
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,430
How many people are out there like
that that we don't know about?

738
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,210
What percentage of the population is
in some terrible place like that where

739
00:41:59,211 --> 00:42:02,360
they're trying to hide from their parents
or they're trying to hide from someone

740
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:06,710
in their family or someone they are
close to what percentage it is Detroit,

741
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:09,230
Michigan to kids.
11 he might just have a girlfriend.

742
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:11,360
He's fucking in a basement somewhere.
That's true.

743
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,890
It'd be banging in the basement.

744
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,430
I don't think so though because they
said they found them so low back there.

745
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,680
Maybe decided to go on an
epic masturbation app when
they found him. I Dunno.

746
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,920
It's full. We had food, good
food down there. He was hiding,

747
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,500
but there was blood that there
was found like on rags and stuff.

748
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:30,130
There's a lot of really weird and
questions about this whole boy.

749
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,370
I didn't hear about that part yet.
Blood, they could be right, but girls do.

750
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:37,130
Girls get their period now 11
in Detroit. They do. They do.

751
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,090
I heard the choice becoming the
metal. So because of the metal, um,

752
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,070
don't whoever said that, tell him to
go. Fuck. Artists are moving in there.

753
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,280
Changing up. Listen, I hope that happens.

754
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,670
We were just there a little while ago.
Yeah, there's, it's, there's houses there.

755
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:51,710
There are $500

756
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:57,810
herselves in 20 years I've gotten a
house for $10 that you didn't do it.

757
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,540
Why didn't you buy a hundred at $10?
All due respect to kid rock and M and M.

758
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,860
I'm not moving to fucking Detroit. I'm
not buying property there. It's just,

759
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,250
it went bad.
I hope it goes back but it went bad.

760
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,240
What are they going to do suddenly
build new plants there? Well listen,

761
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,120
the folks that are there,

762
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:17,240
I definitely think there's like an artist
community there and there's a lot of

763
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:20,060
cool, we met a lot of cool people
that live there. No doubt about it.

764
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:23,810
But I'm saying if you were trying to
like invest in something that you thought

765
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:27,190
would definitely like you think you're
stealing money and I was going to take a

766
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:29,470
look, it's going to take a lot of
work to bring it out right back then.

767
00:43:29,471 --> 00:43:33,500
Detroit people are cool as fuck though,
man. I enjoyed hanging out there.

768
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,570
People were super nice, but I felt
bad. We were on this river, um,

769
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,620
where uh, these people were fishing and
I was like, this water is not clean.

770
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,460
This is dirty water. And they were like,
yeah, it is. And the other, just like,

771
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:47,190
it's one of the most,

772
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:50,360
the area around Zog islands when the
most polluted areas in the country. Wow.

773
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,090
And these people were fishing it
and I was like, man, I mean, how,

774
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,250
I don't know if they're
testing these fish.

775
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,780
I don't know if people
are just eating them.

776
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,720
There were Chinese people fishing in
those fucking dirty. Then it was like,

777
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:03,440
what are you doing it when the residents
were like, what are you doing? They just,

778
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:06,760
they need food, man. That's what
it is. You know, you might have a,

779
00:44:06,761 --> 00:44:09,560
a fish that's not so good, but at
least you're not hungry. You know,

780
00:44:09,561 --> 00:44:13,730
you cook it up. Good Shit if
you're smoking cigarettes already,

781
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,020
you know, what a difference does it
make if you eat a fucking metallic fish,

782
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:22,550
some fish loaded up with this has it
polluted of heavy metal solutions.

783
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,960
Apparently they checked a fish that
they caught outside of Fukushima. Yeah.

784
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,840
And it was fine and it was
one of the fish. It was a,

785
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:34,230
this is science guy who debunks a
lot of the myths about, you know,

786
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,090
climate change and disasters and all
sorts of like when he's like very,

787
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:42,330
very strict, very, um, very,

788
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:45,210
very concise with his, uh, you know,

789
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:49,650
like whether it's politically correct
or not very scientific about his, um,

790
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,820
explanations for these things.
And he was explaining to,

791
00:44:51,821 --> 00:44:55,230
this is a fish that is indigenous
to this area. It doesn't migrate.

792
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,130
She's a fish that's been sucking in
that water filled with radiation.

793
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,880
It's only like a mile off the coast.
I think it was less than a mile.

794
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,600
And you can eat it. And he's
like, these fish are fine. Like,

795
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:09,450
you don't have to worry about
the fish and stuff like that.

796
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,770
They have caught fish that have an
elevated amount of radiation in it.

797
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,710
And this is what's been really
fascinating about Fukushima. Obviously,

798
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:18,810
I'm a fucking idiot.
So when you're listening to me,

799
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:23,010
anything that I say that might
sound tricky, Google it. What's,

800
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,040
what's fascinating about this is that
it's opened me up to paying attention to

801
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:29,940
how many different things have radiation.

802
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,990
Like there was an article the other day
that said Grand Central Station has more

803
00:45:33,991 --> 00:45:37,260
radiation naturally occurring
because of all that stone,

804
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,890
all that marble that they have
inside of their marble. Ha.

805
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,550
It gives off a certain amount of
natural radiation and it radiates.

806
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:49,551
And there's more radiation inside that
giant train station then is allowable at

807
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:55,410
a nuclear power plant for
workers. Rarely, yes. Wow. Wow.

808
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,890
But it's natural radiation. So
it's like when you, I don't know,

809
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:03,000
I don't understand that. That's where she
gets weird. But when you're on a plane,

810
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,140
you're taking megadoses.

811
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:08,660
We had ensign in UAE who
lives in Japan and Ensign. Uh,

812
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,620
he does a lot of relief work
for people have been Fukushima,

813
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,540
trying to help people and spread the word
about how bad the situation is and how

814
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:16,710
many displaced people were up there.

815
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,080
He said that he brought his
Geiger counter with him.

816
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:22,320
He brings the guy and he brought in a
plane. They said when you were in a plane,

817
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:27,000
it's like the same as when you're in
Fukushima. It's, it's fucking terrible.

818
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,450
My Dad said that you could actually
hang out there for a couple of hours and

819
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:34,650
you'll be fine. So, so if you find
a fish that's like a mile off shore,

820
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:37,770
that fish is probably not just hanging
out at that exact location for, you know,

821
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:40,920
the whole time it probably just swam
there, got caught and you know, so I,

822
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:42,690
it's probably safe enough to eat.

823
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,480
No, but that is, fish
wasn't a migratory fish.

824
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:48,750
That was one of the reasons
why it was significant.

825
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:53,820
I think it's hard to put in our stupid
little heads how big the fucking ocean is.

826
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:56,730
Pretty big. Yeah, it's hard. It's so big.

827
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,330
It's bigger than then the country.
The continent, yeah. It's silly.

828
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,240
If you look at what the Pacific Ocean
looks like and you look at the constant in

829
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:06,390
North America, we're like, it's a little
tiny thing in there. We don't have,

830
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,930
we don't show the whole thing on the map
because there's not enough room to show

831
00:47:09,931 --> 00:47:13,650
the whole thing on the map. Oh really?
I mean short of, I mean look, you,

832
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:16,860
you don't really get it. You don't
get it. There's no way you get it.

833
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,210
The only way you get it, fine Australia
fine. Just go out there and find it.

834
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:26,190
It's like fucking, they don't
understand or it could be so much water.

835
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:30,400
You can't see an end to the left.
You can see an end to the right.

836
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,980
You can't see an end to head and
you can't see an end behind you.

837
00:47:32,981 --> 00:47:36,490
There's everywhere you look is just
water like a pie and you, yeah,

838
00:47:36,491 --> 00:47:39,800
and you better have a fucking
good one of them. I'm fine. Yeah.

839
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,110
That's the stuff we were
going to get back to it.

840
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,890
Exactly. There was a
part in life, the play,

841
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,540
I just watched it in
three d the other day,

842
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:50,280
but there was a part in it where the
tiger made this crazy face right before he

843
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:52,800
was about to pee on the,
on the main character.

844
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,120
And it was so trippy that it was made
me wonder why they threw it in there.

845
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:58,890
Like it was very unrealistic.

846
00:47:58,891 --> 00:48:01,740
And you were saying that you thought
that movie kind of felt unrealistic,

847
00:48:01,741 --> 00:48:02,330
the tiger.

848
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:05,870
Well it was completely unrealistic as
far as the dynamic of the relationship

849
00:48:05,871 --> 00:48:09,530
between the guy and the tiger.
The fact that they fought over food,

850
00:48:09,531 --> 00:48:12,520
the fact that he beat the tiger back
and he was on a boat. I mean that,

851
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:15,770
that I can go so far
if he had super powers,

852
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,630
he was wolverine or something like that.

853
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,960
You, you, you understood the

854
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:23,710
yeah, explained all that to
happen. No, he's hallucinating.

855
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:27,490
But during the movie I'm like, this is
just pissing me off. Cause too much.

856
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,790
When, when he was trying to get up that
ladder and he wouldn't let him in the

857
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:30,850
[inaudible]

858
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:33,930
boat, man, that was
some deep shit eat shit.

859
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,240
But the problem is that's my only
problem with it is the unreal.

860
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,600
I mean, I shouldn't have a problem
with it if it's just a dream. Right.

861
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,580
But the unrealistic movement of the
cat that was driving me fucking crazy

862
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:48,310
because without that, the whole movie
does not exist. It doesn't work.

863
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,360
It's just special bugs movie. Yeah,
because they all use a slow mo.

864
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:56,980
Did you see that one? Like this is, wow,
this is just a commercial for that camera.

865
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:01,750
You can't do that. Hey, did
you like Godzilla? I'm going
to guess. Yes. Only the end.

866
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,520
I love the end. What was the end
when he killed that monster? Yeah.

867
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,600
Spoiler alert. No, you can display this.

868
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:15,460
Say Spoiler to get a limited amount of
time and then it's like go fuck yourself.

869
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:21,280
Ample opportunity to say somebody
who's a soup bowl winner the next day.

870
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:25,180
Y'All can give away star wars at
some point. That's a shitty movie.

871
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,290
Do you have a year to watch it?
It wasn't that shitty.

872
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:34,230
Some people,
it's like the hipster thing,

873
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:39,010
just so dumb. Even breaking bad was
like, oh, like unpleasant in it. Well,

874
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,760
he'll do anything good.
He's die storyline in there.

875
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:47,590
Almost said what happens to them. Say
it all has problems. No, don't do that.

876
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:51,670
Listen, it was a decent special
effects movie and Godzilla.

877
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,300
Godzilla was most certainly no spoilers,
no spoilers.

878
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,860
Most certainly the best Godzilla of
all time. Without a doubt. You didn't.

879
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,600
The CGI is mind the part where he got,
hey,

880
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:05,740
easy buried under that building and then
all of a sudden he was up and fighting

881
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:08,440
again and then the next thing he was
back to buried under that building.

882
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,420
Nobody likes guys getting knocked out
with like pistols in the movie and you're

883
00:50:13,421 --> 00:50:16,210
getting up and then duking their way out
of a bar. Nobody likes him more than me.

884
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,200
It's my, those are my favorites. So
unrealistic. I'm saying not getting up,

885
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,610
being buried under a building,

886
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:25,660
suddenly fighting the second my throat
guy and then back to buried under the

887
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:28,130
building as if he'd never
had gotten out of it. Yeah,

888
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,970
ridiculous. Yeah, like just
terrible editing. That really
happens. Yeah. He got out.

889
00:50:31,971 --> 00:50:34,970
I was like, wait, what's happening?
There was no consistency.

890
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,810
They just edited it wrong. When,
how about the dude? Yeah. Horrible.

891
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,810
The dude had like the worst luck of
all time, but yet the best luck. Yeah.

892
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,060
It was all the character.

893
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:46,600
Like all these terrible things keep
happening and yet he's just wanting,

894
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,440
but Godzilla looked awesome.
What I loved about Godzilla was the face.

895
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,060
It was incredible.
I was gonna ask you,

896
00:50:56,061 --> 00:51:00,230
Tony said that he hated it because the
face was really round and he looked very

897
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:04,490
Japanese and cutesy, cutesy. Know what,
I don't want to, Tony's an evil man.

898
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,570
I think that was Tony.
I said that,

899
00:51:05,571 --> 00:51:08,750
I'm pretty sure he's the one that
said he looks Japanese and evil.

900
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,850
Tony Hinchcliffe cutesy, cutesy.
I will go with Qsu. Yeah,

901
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,230
Tony Hinchcliffe. Um, I don't know why
he was thinking about it. Looking cutesy.

902
00:51:18,231 --> 00:51:20,150
I thought God's all looked awesome.
It looked pretty cool.

903
00:51:20,151 --> 00:51:24,530
I had no problem with the
look. I just loved the movie,

904
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:28,700
felt it felt like a bunch of Hollywood
people. Made it like interim afternoon.

905
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,190
We'll just felt like when you have,
uh, an idea that's that high concept,

906
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,860
you can run into,
cut the shit moments.

907
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,830
You could run into a bunch of cut the
shit moments and there was just too many

908
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:41,120
of them were your money.
Yeah.

909
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:44,270
I mean you could get away with
doing a movie like 28 days later.

910
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,050
Obviously there's completely
different types of movie,

911
00:51:46,051 --> 00:51:49,040
but there was no cut the shit
move moments in that movie.

912
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:53,060
That movie was hard fucking quarters
one dragged you into it. Really?

913
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:56,790
What was one when he's in the
boiler work, oh come on. It's

914
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:03,290
probably more what was the spoiler?
So he goes to that compound,

915
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,640
right? With all the army people they turn
cause that's how I like it. Realistic.

916
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:09,950
That's what humans would
do. Right. It's a, you know,

917
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:15,740
not pick Kelsey or whatever, someone's
view of the world. But um, no.

918
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:19,970
Who was that director? Kubrick.
Kubrick. Yeah. He would always like,

919
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:23,540
humans will just devolve to animals.
Pretty much trigger white society.

920
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:27,650
So that's fine. But then he like
releases like the ones I'll be into the,

921
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,680
they were keeping, but he's like
suddenly an expert with weapons.

922
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,460
All the whole movie's like trying to
figure out what's happening. I love that.

923
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,360
That'd be no clue. He's never going to
try to find a cure. He's not that special.

924
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:39,530
And then suddenly he's just got,

925
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,930
he's really awesome with a
machine gun out of nowhere. No.

926
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:47,840
How long had he been hanging
out with those resisters?
It was too fast. Too fast.

927
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,420
Cause you only it the only moment.
Everything else is great.

928
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:54,940
What if you had a background in
military or some shit? Like okay,

929
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:56,480
that makes sense.
That's very cliche though.

930
00:52:56,481 --> 00:52:59,330
The loan guy who had a
background in the military,

931
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:04,040
he's a loner fucking same shit. Carl
has been using a gun. He's fucking six.

932
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,290
I it shoot somebody over his
father's shoulder have like ars.

933
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,600
He's older now shooting a lot of zombies.
You get good at shit like that.

934
00:53:11,601 --> 00:53:14,570
Kids are good at video games in
that world is awesome at guns.

935
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,240
I feel bad for Carl because he
has zero chance of getting laid.

936
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,380
This no pussy for Carl [inaudible].

937
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,490
He's already wandering around
shooting fucking shooting zombies.

938
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,610
There's no pussy. He's like some older
checks that might eventually take them.

939
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,970
Would you, I'm going to change
the extent the question,

940
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,230
how long until you would, um, once
you heard about cutting off the arms,

941
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:37,920
the zombies and like, fuck man, fuck one.

942
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,820
I would worry that, look dude, I
wouldn't fuck someone with aids.

943
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,800
Imagine the fucking,
someone with a Zombie pack.

944
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:46,140
It's like people with Aids
live a lot longer than zombies.

945
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,870
People with AIDS look
way better than zombies.

946
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:53,340
They just need some fucking medication.
There's modern drugs. Okay, you can,

947
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:58,530
but I wouldn't do that. Would you
fuck a guy who had a, who had aids?

948
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,840
No. What about girls? Of course not. No,

949
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:05,880
of course not.
So why would you fuck a Zombie?

950
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:09,510
Because there's nobody else to fuck.
Oh fuck dude.

951
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:13,050
You wouldn't even if there was
nowhere else to fuck hold on its back.

952
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:17,380
It would if there was no one else.
Oh yeah, maybe just fun. Lisbon.

953
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,760
But you'd have a progress the,
but we'd have a problem.

954
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:24,000
He'd still feel like a
rapist. You imagined it holds
it. Some girls Zombie down,

955
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:28,500
she's screaming and national and you're
trying to fucker, what'd it feel?

956
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:32,050
Terrible. If it starts screaming at
different way. You feel that, oh,

957
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:38,940
what if you fucked him and they came back
to life. Thank you. I couldn't tell you,

958
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:41,070
but that was a secret.
I knew I had to fuck me.

959
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,620
You can imagine about a cure that
none of you are going to believe

960
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:49,620
a prince and a frog heloc. You the
girl had a kiss the frog, right?

961
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:53,310
The guy's got a fuck the Zombie and
pretend she comes back to like my fucking

962
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:55,830
arms off asshole. I'm
so sorry. I didn't know.

963
00:54:55,831 --> 00:54:57,090
I thought you were never coming back.

964
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,840
That's a great idea for a movie and
everyone just starts fucking zombies and

965
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:02,480
then like you have to
fuck the little ones too,

966
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,480
just so that becomes one of the
bite you while you're doing it.

967
00:55:04,481 --> 00:55:07,080
It's like fuck that. I got
a target. You'll be calling
them rape the young debt.

968
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,120
That would be the end all raping on
dead through the, yeah, the whole,

969
00:55:12,121 --> 00:55:13,590
all three of the movie
would be death metal.

970
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:19,590
Just guys checking doors down.
Holden zombies down.

971
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:22,590
Hail ass is bobbing up and down.

972
00:55:22,591 --> 00:55:27,591
Male and female zombies
just to interracial intergen
under orgy of fucking dead

973
00:55:28,501 --> 00:55:30,240
people as they come back till they get,

974
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,030
they got to start fucking wherever zombies
are left to go back to the compound.

975
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:37,410
Dude's got a fucking oil drum fill
of Viagra. I got to fight the fight

976
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:42,340
for the bang on future imagined.

977
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:46,260
It's like between fucking and biting like
it's a race between the fuckers in the

978
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:49,490
biters cause the biters would fuck you
back a little bit. They bite you back.

979
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,900
Then the fuckers in the I am of fellow.

980
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,170
Could you imagine if the only way that
you could get them to come back is to

981
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:02,910
fuck them?
Fuck everybody.

982
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:06,810
He didn't have to fuck your enemies
because you would wouldn't want him being

983
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:08,100
zombies and eating your family.

984
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:12,990
So there'd be a fuck him to come up with
a boner to fuck. Fuck. You're a landlord.

985
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:16,890
That annoying lady lives down the block.
The fucking yappy poodle.

986
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:18,420
That bitch turn into a Zombie.
You gotta fuck fucker.

987
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,350
Zombies like making it really hard
for you to like I got this one.

988
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,810
Everybody would be rushing
to yoga mat places. God.

989
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,810
How long till zombies? How long
until it triggers? Oh yeah.

990
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:34,510
Whoever got locked in the zone in the,
in the yoga, whatever it happened there.

991
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,920
If you can get to a yoga mat,

992
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:41,080
most likely you're going to have some
hot chasing shapes on bare Assamese and

993
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:45,040
that might kind of be a freak or the
farts have stayed in there for too long

994
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:47,620
with that.
Somby just completely gave into you.

995
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,160
What does the psalm he started backing up
on? Your ticket was a female yoga Toby.

996
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:56,020
She started backing up on your tank. She
was really into it. I'm like, Holy Shit.

997
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:58,870
But she's still, he reaches back the
closet. Yes sir. You got to hold of wrist,

998
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,880
but she's, she's back in India. Yeah.

999
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,500
What'd you go to yoga first and with the
youngest the first place I go if I was

1000
00:57:05,501 --> 00:57:07,140
on a mission to save the world at first.
But

1001
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:13,721
yeah,

1002
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:18,070
but you see it's a race between if you
could fuck them before they can bite you

1003
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:19,490
or their friend's bite you.
Right.

1004
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:24,610
So you can't go into places like a
fucking Korean barbecue solo plus eat.

1005
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:29,230
You don't come back at all. It was a good
point. You might kill you. You only come,

1006
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:31,420
you only turn into one of them
if they bite you a little.

1007
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,060
If they bite you a little, get a
little blood on you. I come fast.

1008
00:57:34,061 --> 00:57:38,270
So I won't be worried. How cause that'd
be making an army of real quick. I know.

1009
00:57:38,271 --> 00:57:40,150
I don't think so.
I think you need to fill them up.

1010
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:43,450
I think like every time you come inside
of them to get like a little less Zombie.

1011
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,673
Oh,

1012
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:50,470
more human down for like weeks.
Chain him up in your basement,

1013
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:52,143
Bang them.

1014
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,420
But then the problem would be both get
addicted to having sex in that way.

1015
00:57:55,421 --> 00:57:58,730
Once you become a normal person, how long
have you get hard? Every time you hear

1016
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,320
boner? Yeah. Maybe.

1017
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:05,590
Maybe just automatically here that you
hold the chicks hands behind her back.

1018
00:58:05,591 --> 00:58:09,910
She was like, what the fuck? I don't like
this. Ari. Cut The shit. Oh sorry. Sorry.

1019
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,250
It's just we're playing raped.
Zombie.

1020
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,380
What'd be gross that we'd
all come back to life.

1021
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:19,120
But half of them would be
like missing like chunks.

1022
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,240
[inaudible] fine.

1023
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,330
So she's got no lips.
She's a sweet girl.

1024
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,090
She draws pictures of
the things she wants.

1025
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,320
I can walk down with your
hold until that hand too much.

1026
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:39,550
It's just as bad for it's breaks
off now they're a regular person.

1027
00:58:39,551 --> 00:58:43,380
They start crying and looking at
this stubs. That's why is that?

1028
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,400
That's the thing that people
are constantly worried about,

1029
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:47,170
the constantly worried
about the Zombie apocalypse.

1030
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:52,330
That's like a recurring theme cause
maybes fucking Bible. Is that what it is?

1031
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,580
Oh, I don't know. There's no such
thing as zombies in the Bible,

1032
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:59,290
but do you think it's because people
worry that it's so loosely put together,

1033
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:02,680
society so loosely put together is
really become that easily. Just fuck up.

1034
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,600
Something go wrong.
What would make it go wrong?

1035
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,780
That some fucking disease it
gives us rabies or something.

1036
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,270
You think of things like that,
like Whoa, don't go near that.

1037
00:59:10,271 --> 00:59:13,810
Squares with 12 monkeys came out.
I was like a real man.

1038
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,930
That shit's real is they have toxins
that can like get with everybody.

1039
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:21,800
That was a terrifying movie. There's a
lot of those movies. Those Apocalypto

1040
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,930
apocalyptic movies aren't there, so it's
fine. Fuck load of a man. 28 days later,

1041
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:31,560
they're 28 weeks and that was 20 days
later. Yes. There was a something.

1042
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:36,260
They a chimp disease, right?
They manufactured it and
then it got into people out.

1043
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:40,360
God Damn, that was a good Zombie movie.
They were fast as fuck. Like, oh wow.

1044
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:42,980
They really fast.
We pet her.

1045
00:59:42,981 --> 00:59:45,890
I don't know how the fuck do went
back to slow zombies after that.

1046
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:50,980
28 days later would be 10 times more epic
if those motherfuckers were fast rage.

1047
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,740
Could you imagine if those motherfuckers
were fast, that movie would be,

1048
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:58,610
that show would be so different running
after it was passed. I don't know if it,

1049
00:59:58,611 --> 00:59:59,660
you could do it.
I mean,

1050
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:03,170
maybe one of the elements in
being able to construct these,

1051
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:07,430
these stories that take place over long
periods of time is that the zombies

1052
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:10,220
can't be the biggest threat because
if they're not the biggest threat,

1053
01:00:10,221 --> 01:00:12,070
then people sort of become
the biggest threat. Right,

1054
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:15,920
because that show is a show about the
zombies are sort of periphery at this

1055
01:00:15,921 --> 01:00:16,490
point.

1056
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:21,110
Like what the show's really all about
is people like turning on people walking

1057
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:24,080
dead, right. That's what it's all
about is obviously like a, it's just,

1058
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,560
it's like a speed bump. They should avoid
that thing. It should be nothing. Like,

1059
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:31,310
I used to go crazy when I watched that
show when they were all at the prison and

1060
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:34,140
they were all outside. I'm like, why
aren't you killing them? Like Wah.

1061
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,250
And then one day became a problem.
Like what? Either right there,

1062
01:00:37,251 --> 01:00:40,280
they're pressed up against the cage.
Occasionally you'd see them kill them,

1063
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,850
but there were days on end without their
plant tomatoes because there's because

1064
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,170
outside of the fence you mean there's,
there's millions of them.

1065
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,420
It's just fucking kill him every
day. That's what you do today, dude.

1066
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,880
That's what you do today
is to catch them on fire.

1067
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,150
You know like this Puerto like hot
lava. That's too, that's too hard.

1068
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,880
Why don't you do that? We just
stabbing the head, stabbed in the head.

1069
01:00:58,881 --> 01:01:02,270
It takes five seconds to look out
for today. That's your workout. What?

1070
01:01:02,271 --> 01:01:05,330
There was so many, you could just mowed
them all down and like big portions.

1071
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,850
That's you're taking the
lazy way. You don't want a
goddamn exercise. I'm talking,

1072
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:13,460
I'm thinking like one of those miners
acts as well as pick axes and he's just

1073
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,110
doing like Kettlebell exercises.

1074
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:19,460
Just smashing these zombies are
things in the head. Yeah, the switch.

1075
01:01:19,461 --> 01:01:22,130
You got to go to a lot of lefties cause
you don't want to imbalance your back.

1076
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,680
Do you think you could do that?
Could you? Even if it was a Zombie,

1077
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:27,800
because I think I'd be back to like,
oh you talking about do that right now.

1078
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:31,400
If it was a girl crew zombies,
I wouldn't need any preparation.

1079
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,160
There are zombies up against the fence.

1080
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,680
You wouldn't even take me five seconds
to stab the first Zombie in the head.

1081
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:40,280
If you gave me a nice big sword type
thing and there was zombies and I had to

1082
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:42,920
stab him, I would immediately
start stabbings on. Huh?

1083
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,850
You would see like the human element,
like a little necklace that you're like,

1084
01:01:46,851 --> 01:01:51,590
oh I that neck. Nope. Nope. Right.
Your brain, that's not a little kid.

1085
01:01:51,591 --> 01:01:56,180
That's monster off with his head. Yeah,
they had that. I always have that one.

1086
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:58,520
So somebody sees their
kid. Yeah, whatever.

1087
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:01,940
Not me like stabby stabby I
know how to get over things.

1088
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,370
That's
fucked up.

1089
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,220
That was the most fucked up part of that
show where guys have like kill their

1090
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:13,100
wives and shit and killed their
family members. Killed her daughters.

1091
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,610
That's tough. The one that God kept his
door locked up. He thought she was sick.

1092
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,900
I kept like talking to all the
time. Ooh, that, yeah, that is dark.

1093
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,140
Dark would be an example of,

1094
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:27,150
it wouldn't be that example that you're
very specific scenario would definitely

1095
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:28,830
take place with a lot of people.

1096
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:33,840
There would be too hard for them to take
and also they would also hope that one

1097
01:02:33,841 --> 01:02:36,570
day there'll be a cure. Yeah.
Yeah. Then we could like say it,

1098
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,700
but there's carrying this
threat around all the time.

1099
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:42,750
I wonder if you could have the same
show with that 28 days later style.

1100
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:47,010
Well I was just, people survive
in this Lumbees much faster.

1101
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,650
But would the stories be the same?

1102
01:02:49,651 --> 01:02:52,770
Because it seems like they would be the
Zombie to be a way bigger threat. Yeah.

1103
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,550
They were on you at any time
and then it's over. Yeah,

1104
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,750
they were way bigger threat.

1105
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,540
He couldn't have as many like
relationships with people that go bad.

1106
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,700
You wouldn't really get to that.

1107
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:08,120
You'd just be scrambling for survival
and these things that I'm fucking chasing

1108
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,100
after you full clip with
crazy bloodshot eyes.

1109
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:15,140
Remember that I was 28 weeks later. It
was pretty good too. I was pretty good.

1110
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:19,140
Wasn't as good, but it's
pretty God damn good. Pretty
God damn good. Yeah. That's a,

1111
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:22,980
that's a realistic monster
scenario. Not like Godzilla. Oh,

1112
01:03:22,981 --> 01:03:25,770
there's something that's on
the ocean. It's been there
the whole time waiting. Oh,

1113
01:03:25,771 --> 01:03:29,490
get the fuck outta here.
We tried to kill it during World War II.

1114
01:03:29,491 --> 01:03:32,160
They were trying to kill it. That's what
the nuclear bomb, they weren't tests.

1115
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:33,420
They were trying to kill somebody.

1116
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,730
It's all so badly.

1117
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:39,640
You dummy.
You can watch the animated Gif online.

1118
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,480
Those tests that they did in the South
Pacific, they weren't shooting Godzilla.

1119
01:03:43,481 --> 01:03:47,780
You can't relate to his truck's movie.
They did that in the x meant to what?

1120
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,340
They said that Kennedy was a mutant bitch.
Stop.

1121
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,790
How do you think one man got
shot three times? One bullet.

1122
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:59,320
He was trying to curve the bullet
of white bitch. Stop you guys.

1123
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,910
I can't believe you
left that in the script.

1124
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,930
That's one of the summer.
You see the been in the middle.

1125
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:05,680
You need to take it to a
board of people who look,

1126
01:04:05,681 --> 01:04:07,880
we will watch this and tell
you like what's ridiculous.

1127
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:13,100
We're all sitting around smoking. Why
would he do that? Why would he do that?

1128
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:18,200
Do that as a service desk squad movie,
We watch a movie idea. We'll sit down,

1129
01:04:18,201 --> 01:04:21,310
watch a movie together and then give
them feedback, but it's gotta be,

1130
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,640
fuck you asshole. Worthless already.
But we'll give you honest feedback.

1131
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:29,420
We won't like, we'll, we'll cuss in our
feedback. Probably will be like that.

1132
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:34,070
That was fucking stupid. I would never
do that. You know what they would need?

1133
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:37,280
They would need something where you
would agree to not talk about it.

1134
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:41,000
If it was really bad, they would,
they would need that. Don't move.

1135
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,600
He's going to suck when there's no uh,

1136
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:45,170
critical reviews because they don't
put it before the critics. Look,

1137
01:04:45,171 --> 01:04:46,640
you guys got a it and they all know it.

1138
01:04:46,641 --> 01:04:49,610
So like when you see no
ratings on rotten tomatoes,

1139
01:04:49,611 --> 01:04:53,240
avoid that moved the day before they
know it's a piece of shit. Not even,

1140
01:04:53,241 --> 01:04:55,580
those people are diluted enough
to think people will like this.

1141
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:58,180
This also weird movies
that like they don't

1142
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:02,900
for like years, they like sit on the shelf
and then like, do you remember Antonio,

1143
01:05:02,901 --> 01:05:06,260
Ben Dennis, the 13th warrior.
Do you remember that?

1144
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:09,770
It was originally called
like the eater of the dead.

1145
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:15,020
It was a god who was the county,
but Darris he's just chilling,

1146
01:05:15,021 --> 01:05:17,630
man. He got a lot of money just
enjoying himself. Eating cartoons,

1147
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:21,940
eating pineapples and drinking.
Margarita isn't shit eaters of the dead.

1148
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:27,130
The 13th Warrior 6.6 yeah.

1149
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:31,570
It was one of those movies that
took a long time to come out.

1150
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,840
It was a Michael Crighton
book. Oh, well yeah.

1151
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:40,290
I think I read it.
Either I read it or I started to,

1152
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:42,730
I think I started to read it,
but I never actually read it,

1153
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,050
but it's from a long time ago. The
book was written 1976 really? Yeah.

1154
01:05:47,051 --> 01:05:51,520
The book is like way more involved
though and much more like much creepier

1155
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,290
books. They're always get it
better. Well, they do so rare.

1156
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:58,480
They do better than the
San Antonio Banderas movie.

1157
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:03,340
It was way over budget apparently. Oh
yeah. Yeah. How did it go over budget?

1158
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,160
They'd only made 62 like,
why am I paying for all that?

1159
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:08,830
This is how much money they lost.
It made 62 million,

1160
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:13,460
but the budget was more than a hundred
million. Wow. Oh Gee. Wow, wow.

1161
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:16,970
You know like stupid. Is that I
Frankenstein? Maybe. Oh my God,

1162
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,270
you could make that. Who
said you can make it. Dot.

1163
01:06:20,271 --> 01:06:21,860
Frankenstein said you could make that.

1164
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:24,350
Could you imagine if you sit down with
the guys who wanted to make time to go,

1165
01:06:24,351 --> 01:06:26,870
women Wayman.
What you having a sexy Frankenstein?

1166
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,740
Did you just tell me you having a
sexy Frankenstein and he's like, Oh,

1167
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:33,720
I could've swore I could have
sworn I walked in this office.

1168
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:37,160
A Mom told me you wanted me to
invest movie and a sexy Frankenstein.

1169
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:41,500
I did not. I say it. Listen,
listen, listen, listen.
This is what we got. We got,

1170
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:46,670
we got fucking vampires.
Vampires are sexy. Gone to go.

1171
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:49,580
What's the difference in a
vampire and Frankenstein alive?

1172
01:06:49,581 --> 01:06:52,250
Now that we're bolt debt,
Frankenstein is alive,

1173
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:56,540
so a sexy Frankenstein who can pull
it off? I'll tell you what's his name?

1174
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:02,660
Was it Aaron Eckhart? That's who can pull
it off. That is our sexy Frankenstein.

1175
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:05,860
This is what, this is what we've been
missing. Ari, this was a, this is off.

1176
01:07:05,861 --> 01:07:09,160
I could twilight, so wait, he's not going
to like be like a big zombie anymore.

1177
01:07:09,161 --> 01:07:12,920
It's not going to be a big no, no. He's
beautiful. He's delicious. He talks well.

1178
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:17,010
It looks at a guy who's been in a
rough street fight with the box cutter.

1179
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:19,670
It's clearly not fricking stuff.
Hey, he's, he would fucking,

1180
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:23,780
Dracula wasn't even allowed to go in the
sun, but the Edward Guy just sparkled.

1181
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:26,510
Okay. You can change the rules.
It's, it's part of fiction.

1182
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:30,880
While I was at Seattle's overcast. Is that
how they got rid of that? I don't know.

1183
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:33,820
I think that sets the don't put
the V. Yeah, that's what it was.

1184
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:34,720
That's why he went up there.

1185
01:07:34,721 --> 01:07:37,480
They went to Pacific northwest because
that's why they moved up. Never.

1186
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:41,230
The Sun never comes out, but when it does
come out and they glisten. Oh really?

1187
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:44,660
Yeah. Die like a real fucking
vampire. They changed the rules.

1188
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:46,400
That's why it's bullshit.

1189
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,240
It's why pull up without us
getting pulled off of Youtube.

1190
01:07:50,241 --> 01:07:51,080
I don't know if it's possible,

1191
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:55,100
but see if you could pull up video
of Frankenstein with no volume.

1192
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:59,400
Don't put any volume on it and let's just
mock how it looks. Won't matter Jamie.

1193
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:03,060
They'll still pull it. All right.
Fuck it then don't do it. Is this,

1194
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,960
look at it for yourself.
You know when you do,

1195
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:08,890
we need to set it up on that thing so
we can watch it without it being four k

1196
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:12,050
special dot. Come to me. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. We'll do that from now on.

1197
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,700
There's no copper advise in China. Is this
new Frankenstein? Like the same story?

1198
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:21,680
Like as he does he claim please.
Winged creatures making shit up.

1199
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:26,530
They're making shit up. I think it was
like, oh fuck no sparkles when he goes up,

1200
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:31,220
it's bullshit. It's all
bullshit. He's just,

1201
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:36,090
and he's smoldering meanwhile. Oh, how
the fuck is that guy still in class?

1202
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:38,550
You imagine your thousand years old,

1203
01:08:38,551 --> 01:08:41,810
you'd keep going to class cause you don't
want to give anybody suspicious. Oh,

1204
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:46,330
when did Columbus discover? Oh yeah, I
was alive back then. 40 minutes. Right.

1205
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:49,530
And he was actually, this is like
the Spanish flu that killed him,

1206
01:08:49,531 --> 01:08:53,400
which was like thinking in 19
hundreds killed to Edward. Oh really?

1207
01:08:53,401 --> 01:08:57,870
From twilight until he died. Spanish
flu, big Spanish flu and it got killed.

1208
01:08:57,871 --> 01:09:01,200
The vampire and the vampire, he got
vampired right around the same time.

1209
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:06,180
That's how I stayed alive forever. Uh,
same time back in the Spanish flu days.

1210
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:09,390
Oh, okay. So he's always around
for like 100 years or so.

1211
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,840
She's old enough to know that he
shouldn't be in high school anymore. Yeah.

1212
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:14,310
Fucking idiot.
Trying to pretend.

1213
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:16,830
It's like the ideas that he
died when he was in high school.

1214
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:20,430
So we keep me in high school forever.
No. Why? How much does grow a beard?

1215
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:25,140
He's older than I look. Yeah.
Just say I look young for my age.

1216
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:29,220
Hey, don't doubt it. That was
something that I read today online. Um,

1217
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:33,750
where was showing how many Asian
women could be like almost 50.

1218
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:36,870
And they look like the 20 year old.
Is that really true?

1219
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:41,670
You just got back from Japan. They
look for the look younger. Not 20,

1220
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,470
but it looks super young. Like 50 looks
like 30. Let's say that. Wow. Yeah.

1221
01:09:46,471 --> 01:09:50,100
They stay in shape. Low Fat, low fat,
low sugar diets, low sugar diets,

1222
01:09:50,101 --> 01:09:52,020
and they stay in shape.
You have to walk around a lot,

1223
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,750
at least in the few cities I went to.
Hmm.

1224
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,090
I know a couple of girls that are there.
Their skin looks good.

1225
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:02,140
45 and I mean they look pretty sexy.
Yeah. Asian girls keep it for a while. Oh

1226
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,920
yeah. Why is that you think? I don't know.

1227
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:08,810
I think it's just better genetics
that way. Their food, more alien DNA.

1228
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,680
Just that the time, that's all.
It's just the type that stays young.

1229
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:15,260
Longer Jews to have the kind
that makes you smarter. Okay.

1230
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:19,010
Asians have the kind that makes it look,
how did black don't crack without,

1231
01:10:19,011 --> 01:10:22,670
without at risk of sounding really
racist. Yeah. Although I'm not,

1232
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:26,990
I start recording now.
If you look at all the different races,

1233
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,870
obviously this some sort of biological

1234
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:32,810
explanation for this,

1235
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:37,640
but how the fuck did so many Asian
people have such similar features?

1236
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
How the fuck did so many African
people have similar features? I mean,

1237
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:42,650
it's amazing.

1238
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:46,790
It's amazing when you look around and
how many Chinese people have black hair

1239
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,650
and similar skin tone.

1240
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:53,630
How many black people have that hair and
similar skin tone? You know, how many,

1241
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:57,710
how many, I mean it's amazing. It
was whites have a variety. Well,

1242
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:02,120
people who are of mixed race,
you know, like, like my family,

1243
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:05,190
a lot of it comes from Sicily.
And you remember that scene from uh Huh.

1244
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:08,660
You're a true romance.
The Moore's the more,

1245
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:11,330
but I think the Moore's were
Sephardic people. I'm not sure.

1246
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:16,040
I was like Morocco dogs. So black. I'll
show, I'll Shitzu's look like shit soon.

1247
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:18,830
There's all white people like months
right now. Here's what's weird.

1248
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:22,050
Cause breeds of dogs were engineered.
That's why it's crazy.

1249
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:25,320
Breeds of dogs originally were all wolves.
All dogs.

1250
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:28,470
Where at one point in time who knows
how many thousands of years ago,

1251
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:31,860
they don't have no idea. Like when
people started domesticating dogs,

1252
01:11:31,861 --> 01:11:34,590
but they assume that it was right around
the time civilization was invented

1253
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:37,220
whenever and that's my
breeds became a thing. Yeah.

1254
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,240
It's like 10,000 years of breeding.

1255
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,070
That's where you're looking
at when you look at a Shitzu.

1256
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:44,790
When you look at the Husky, when you look
at a wolf there, it's the same animal.

1257
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:49,190
Wow. It started off the
same animal. Like what dog?

1258
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,050
That's it. That's through all.
They all come from wolves,

1259
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,770
which is the weirdest thing. English
bulldog, a wolf who was like,

1260
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:57,930
let's get the two coolest Wolfe's.
Well,

1261
01:11:57,931 --> 01:11:59,700
they had an episode
about it on the cosmos.

1262
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,800
It was really fascinating that the
cosmos show, if you watch that. No,

1263
01:12:03,801 --> 01:12:07,920
I've got ground. That's good. So good.
And it pisses off religious people.

1264
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:10,280
Oh my goodness. Well,
we want, we want the uh,

1265
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,670
whatever theory explained to and
that people put signs and he goes,

1266
01:12:14,671 --> 01:12:16,820
why would I include that?
There's no scientific basis for,

1267
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:21,030
what are you talking about? We're talking
about science of him. Yeah. He's awesome.

1268
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:22,710
He's awesome.
It's fun talking about that.

1269
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,760
What happened was apparently
according to the cosmos,

1270
01:12:26,761 --> 01:12:30,330
is that some wolves got friendly with
people because the people would feed them

1271
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:32,250
and then they kept coming around
to people would feed them.

1272
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,240
They developed a relationship,

1273
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:35,940
but then those wolves to chase off
the other wolves and then they,

1274
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:39,410
they only bread with the wolves that
were friendly and nice wolves. Yeah.

1275
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,540
Those wolves eventually became dogs.
Wow.

1276
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,320
Over who knows how many thousands
of years. Selective breeding,

1277
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:50,580
bringing certain dogs that wolves it
behaving certain ways together. I mean,

1278
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:53,550
I don't know how many generations it
took to do it every new there. But yeah,

1279
01:12:53,551 --> 01:12:55,800
that's what she, that's a human
service when human breeding. Yup.

1280
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:56,993
That's what we were like,

1281
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,750
just like my new theory about
why black people are late. Yeah.

1282
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,680
So you've heard about black people
time and how they just, they're late.

1283
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:06,830
I have no idea what you're talking about.
A racial stereotype.

1284
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:09,340
I've never been heard it.
If you haven't heard now you heard,

1285
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:11,950
I never say anything bad
about black people calling.

1286
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:16,040
John Barrett says it's only
one race. The human race. Um,

1287
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:22,170
cause when you were slaves
you time didn't matter at all.

1288
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,810
What about Jamaicans?
They're on time.

1289
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:31,890
I think they were slaves. It's a
poor example. Any black people over?

1290
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:35,370
What about Africans? Actual Africans?
Yeah. They're hard working people.

1291
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:38,340
Some of the hardest working people
you'll ever hire or African Africans.

1292
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:41,490
Those are the drug dealers in and uh,
uh,

1293
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:45,510
Beijing and Hong Kong u ratting them
out on, on the podcast. It's like that.

1294
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:48,840
All the black people, you're ratting
them out. I guess so. How dare you?

1295
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,220
Because a race dude,

1296
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:53,400
you shouldn't do that because I bet the
Chinese authorities had no idea. I know.

1297
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:58,720
I bet it was a complete
mystery cracked by Ari.

1298
01:13:58,721 --> 01:14:02,060
Shift fear on the Joe Rogan podcast.
Yeah,

1299
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,450
she explained and math.
Mathematics.

1300
01:14:04,451 --> 01:14:06,060
If they got angry and they
started going after you,

1301
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:08,330
this is something that you would think
about your, you're eating lots of meat.

1302
01:14:08,331 --> 01:14:12,250
Like my weight. Too much pot. If you ate
way too much pot cook, you're like, why

1303
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:16,780
did I give you were drug dealers?
What the fuck? I'm such an idiot.

1304
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,440
Oh my God. What was I thinking? Oh my God,

1305
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:25,360
I ratted out all the drug dealers.
The guy from the podcast,

1306
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:30,340
I saw your podcast, your
tickets. You want drugs from me.

1307
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:35,020
I would love, so he might've said that
shit dude. You'd be tripping. No, no, no,

1308
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,540
no. That would kill you. Oh
yeah, I serve you. That's true.

1309
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:42,530
That's worse than not telling you. How
many weeks were you over there? Uh,

1310
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:47,660
two and a half. And you, you were in
China, you were in Singapore? No. No.

1311
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:50,703
Did you go to Africa?

1312
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:56,220
South America and out a few cities around
their Beijing and then a and then Hong

1313
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,990
Kong. So what was the biggest
city out of the Shanghai?

1314
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:04,020
Shanghai shoots once he 4 million on
black God and one of the New York 24

1315
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:08,410
million, right? Yeah. Manhattan has nine,
but I mean like New York stuffed in there.

1316
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:12,700
Normally stuffed in there after. There's
a few places with like one story. Thanks.

1317
01:15:12,701 --> 01:15:16,360
But not much. Everything's just tall
buildings because La is 20 million people.

1318
01:15:16,361 --> 01:15:19,300
But the good news is they're flat out.

1319
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:22,690
The flattened down I think
alleviates a little bit of pressure.

1320
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:27,440
I was completely flat, so, but
it's low like stories and stuff.

1321
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:32,020
Oh, all short buildings? No,
I'd say actually the ground
is flat so you could bike.

1322
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:33,730
Oh, okay. That's not what I meant.

1323
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:37,120
I meant that they will stack
on top of each other. Yeah, no,

1324
01:15:37,121 --> 01:15:39,820
they have a hundred stores. Yeah. See
that's the difference in New York and La.

1325
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:42,490
New York doesn't really
have those. Yeah. Excuse me.

1326
01:15:42,491 --> 01:15:44,230
La doesn't really have the
a hundred percent safe.

1327
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:47,950
No one's doing anything to
anybody. Again. Why has the those,

1328
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,660
those apartments on Wilshire a few,

1329
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:53,500
it was like century city then
you really have it fairly big.

1330
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:56,050
Like 16 floors. Yeah. Did they fail?

1331
01:15:56,290 --> 01:16:01,210
Did they like Americans or did you
feel like they uh, didn't care?

1332
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,960
Well, the shows I played two,
we're looking for ex pats.

1333
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:07,960
It was like 15 and 20% of Americans.
So what was the,

1334
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:12,970
it was the rest of it was Chinese. No,
the rest of his English Australia and um,

1335
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,590
and they're cool.

1336
01:16:14,591 --> 01:16:16,750
I mean there are a little bit conservative
because they don't have any plumbers

1337
01:16:16,751 --> 01:16:18,220
that are over there.
Right.

1338
01:16:18,221 --> 01:16:21,100
They have like people that have worked
for the embassy or people that are like

1339
01:16:21,101 --> 01:16:24,340
work for banks. Right? Right. Little
more conservative and like smarter,

1340
01:16:24,341 --> 01:16:28,390
but they're that they're
adventurous people. Right.
People go to work in Shanghai,

1341
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:30,790
we're in Hong Kong instead
of where they from.

1342
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:33,460
It's like you guys are the cool
people that want to do stuff.

1343
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,130
That's a good way of looking
at it. I mean, it was,

1344
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:39,010
they were all cool or running
from the law in other countries.

1345
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:45,010
Those are often the good people
as well. Yeah, that's crazy.

1346
01:16:45,011 --> 01:16:48,100
So who said this? Well, you don't have
to tell me the person's name, but,

1347
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:50,450
so you had your agents at the salt roads.

1348
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:53,320
Talked to my agent at an airport and he
tells him he goes on those things and he

1349
01:16:53,321 --> 01:16:57,940
got me and Schubert went to
a different time. Wow. Yeah.

1350
01:16:57,941 --> 01:16:58,930
So it was just these scenes,

1351
01:16:58,931 --> 01:17:02,710
they start their own scene and then
they'll bring out a guy to do their four

1352
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:05,830
rooms and then they'll team up with
another guy and another scene. Wow.

1353
01:17:05,831 --> 01:17:10,610
And these guys fly from America? No,
there is, and this is the coolest part.

1354
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:15,680
There are brand new comedy seems
starting from scratch in China, in China.

1355
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:20,300
Whoa. Both in Chinese now.
And uh, English speaking.

1356
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:22,670
Wow.
And the people that are already there,

1357
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,770
they're working for banks
that are working as teachers.

1358
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:27,140
And then they see a show and
someone goes, Hey, guess what?

1359
01:17:27,141 --> 01:17:30,650
Everybody's going to be an open mic next
Thursday because they found some bar

1360
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:34,460
that will allow it. And um, and then
somebody tries cost of these people.

1361
01:17:34,461 --> 01:17:37,880
They're like, longest is like
three years. That's amazing. Yeah.

1362
01:17:37,881 --> 01:17:39,380
It's all starting from scratch.
There's no rules.

1363
01:17:39,381 --> 01:17:41,840
There's no like this is the way it is.

1364
01:17:41,841 --> 01:17:43,590
You have to wait till these guys
move on and then you can put,

1365
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,540
there's no to learn from either other than
youtube. That's so cool. That's great.

1366
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:51,500
Yeah. That's amazing. From scratch. It was
really exciting when if they take over,

1367
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:52,370
imagine,

1368
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:55,670
imagine if China takes over and becomes
like the number one comedy community in

1369
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,270
rural areas,

1370
01:17:56,270 --> 01:18:00,500
but co China has this style of comedy
that's like this thousand year old like

1371
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:05,530
Abbott and Costello with cadence changes
so that the new guys that speak both

1372
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:10,100
are like trying to do with like regular
style comedy and people are like, wait,

1373
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:13,670
what is, I don't understand what you're
doing. Oh, so it's a cadence issue. Yeah,

1374
01:18:13,671 --> 01:18:16,580
it's like way different than
they're used to. I saw a guy,

1375
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:21,610
there's a video about a guy from Canada
who moved to China and it became a

1376
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:23,900
comedian.
He was a comedian in America,

1377
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:28,880
but he learned Chinese really
learn Chinese speaks. Which one?

1378
01:18:28,881 --> 01:18:31,220
Mandarin. I don't know which one,
but people that have done that does,

1379
01:18:31,221 --> 01:18:32,510
bishop did it for the last year.

1380
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:36,130
It took a bunch of Chinese
mandarin classes recently.
Chinese. Who's this desk?

1381
01:18:36,131 --> 01:18:40,550
Bishop. He's a, uh, he's big in Ireland
but he's from New York originally. Wow.

1382
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:45,020
And he just, I think he did a show
that's a ballsy move. Ballsy move.

1383
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:46,900
Just let the Beijing for a year.

1384
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:50,810
Now he's in his second year Q managing
going from not speaking Chinese to

1385
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:53,940
speaking Chinese for a fucking
living in front of Chinese.

1386
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:55,190
He's such a foreign language.

1387
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:59,330
How I got a towel and like making
fun of the alphabet and like,

1388
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:02,930
and like why the certain symbols,
it looked like certain things. Wow.

1389
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:08,100
Hell and how like how difficult is it
to learn how to talk in that language?

1390
01:19:08,151 --> 01:19:10,070
He said you've got to write new
but you can't translate your bits.

1391
01:19:10,071 --> 01:19:13,970
You've got to write new bits for it.
References are so off that it just,

1392
01:19:13,971 --> 01:19:16,520
it just won't. Why?
And it was a lot of it,

1393
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:20,630
like something is really big and like
Chinese stuff, culture is losing face,

1394
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,310
like way bigger than you would think.
Yeah,

1395
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,270
but like losing faces.

1396
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,820
Like let's say I'm trying to pay for
a meal and you're like, no, I got it.

1397
01:19:28,821 --> 01:19:31,460
I'm like, no, no, I got it.
You're like, no, I can pay
it. Like I'd be like, hey man,

1398
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,860
you got to let me do this here.
Right.

1399
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:35,690
I put my card out like
you gotta let me do this.

1400
01:19:35,691 --> 01:19:37,580
You can't embarrass me in
front of these people. Oh,

1401
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:40,400
it's more than just like
slight embarrassment.

1402
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,920
That's another reason why there's
less crime is cause people were like,

1403
01:19:42,921 --> 01:19:46,700
what am I going to get caught shoplifting?
Oh that's cool. I'm embarrassed.

1404
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:50,300
I'll be, it's the guard of
the way to not be that person.

1405
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:55,280
So is there statistically less crime?
Like the American Shanghai, you can walk,

1406
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:58,430
they say women can walk three 30 in the
morning drunk and no one is touching him.

1407
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:02,990
Wow. The only violence is acts of
rebellion against this country. Whoa.

1408
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,790
It's that country. I mean, yeah.

1409
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:07,980
Where people take out machetes and
fucking hack up a Mazda game. Ooh.

1410
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,690
Which they show on the subways by the way.

1411
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,360
They show Mahjong Games on the subways.

1412
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,720
They show module on Games getting
hacked by these fucking wiggers.

1413
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:20,280
What do you mean South China?
The or rebelling. Okay.

1414
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:25,250
There the 7% minority ethnically, what
are they? What's a weaker, but I dunno,

1415
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:29,910
it's a different ethnic group. How
you spell it? I think w I e. G.

1416
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:31,950
E r but it might be w e. G. E. R.

1417
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:38,370
You can put an ethnic w e I know,
probably come up [inaudible] gun. Yeah,

1418
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:41,730
they look a little different.
They have different food and um,

1419
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:46,140
there's 7% and in some cities like
1% but they don't, I don't know,

1420
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:48,150
they don't like, they want to
break off or something. So they,

1421
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:51,630
they're the ones that got
the big stabbings that were
going on and though these

1422
01:20:51,631 --> 01:20:54,870
videos of this module on playing game
going on and this guy just lifts up his

1423
01:20:54,871 --> 01:20:59,520
shirt, pulls out an ax, a little hand
axe and just starts accessing this guy.

1424
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:02,880
And then the other guy also
watching, he's like, oh, it's on.

1425
01:21:02,881 --> 01:21:07,250
And he just picks up his shirt and starts
fucking accessing these people. Yeah.

1426
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:08,960
Then everyone,
like if it's just mayhem,

1427
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,550
somebody like is what
they tried to tackle him.

1428
01:21:11,551 --> 01:21:14,850
He comes back to is the axis girl a few
more times and they chased him down.

1429
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:20,680
Weaker. The way it's spelled, it's a
very unusual spelled. It's spelled u.

1430
01:21:20,681 --> 01:21:23,080
Y. G. H. U. R.

1431
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:25,710
Wow. I would not have
guessed that. Say that again.

1432
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:30,930
You why g? H. U R wow.

1433
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:36,100
It's also spelled in another instance
you I g h u r y or you die and their

1434
01:21:38,451 --> 01:21:39,530
Chinese Muslims.

1435
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:43,040
Yeah, they're always started.
The trouble. The Muslims.

1436
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,430
Yeah,
but they showed this on the,

1437
01:21:46,431 --> 01:21:49,400
on the subway that's over the kids
there and it's like Jesus, they really,

1438
01:21:49,401 --> 01:21:53,630
I mean they blurred right as the hacking
like goes on God the head and stuff.

1439
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,530
My God. See that when you're on
the, on the train. Yeah. The show,

1440
01:21:57,531 --> 01:22:00,780
everybody now they have complete control
over the media. All the media. So the,

1441
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:04,190
the government has complete control
and it's not hidden. We are here.

1442
01:22:04,191 --> 01:22:06,040
Like what does that feel like?
Well,

1443
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:08,270
they kind of don't know that they're
really getting the real story.

1444
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:11,870
So like they say it's the wiggers, but
you know how there's like rumors, like,

1445
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:15,530
I dunno what al Qaeda is and what the
other one is. It's like they say that,

1446
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:19,580
but who knows what that really is. What's
the other group? Al Qaeda and Taliban.

1447
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:24,170
But they're, they're just
like, we really don't know. Um,

1448
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:28,700
but you know, it's different than
here and it's the same as here.

1449
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:31,400
It's like they were going to
put chips in all the computers,

1450
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,760
so you couldn't go on sites that tiny,
didn't know that you can't go to Google,

1451
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:38,780
you can go on a VPN and just go through
a different server and get all this

1452
01:22:38,781 --> 01:22:42,890
stuff. You know, Google is a
very concerned about China.
Oh yeah. They're concerned.

1453
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:43,161
Also,

1454
01:22:43,161 --> 01:22:46,670
other companies are concerned about China
because China will just copy shit. Oh,

1455
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:50,420
absolutely. They have fake apple stores
that are just totally scaffold sorts.

1456
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:54,480
My friend who's turned her sparks, who's
helping run the scene in Shanghai, uh,

1457
01:22:54,481 --> 01:22:58,490
so he's bringing mister softee to China.
He got it like a licensing agreement.

1458
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,390
The ice cream.
Yeah.

1459
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:02,720
And he's bringing his mister softee trucks
out there and they're starting to do

1460
01:23:02,721 --> 01:23:07,270
good, and then someone else will just
paint up van. Exactly like mister softee,

1461
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,680
the same exact colors,

1462
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:12,910
serve the same things and just park it
right in front of his mister softee van.

1463
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:16,510
Wow. It just looks like he put to bear
there together at the same time and the

1464
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:18,140
government doesn't do anything.
It's like, what will they do?

1465
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:22,370
You got a good idea now. Now they're, now
they're doing it. That's amazing. Yeah.

1466
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,790
Yeah. It's hard that you don't think
in terms of copyright laws. Yeah.

1467
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:29,860
They don't think in terms
of litigation either. Right.

1468
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:33,580
It's just a totally different kind of
culture as far as like our constant suing

1469
01:23:33,581 --> 01:23:37,510
of each other back and forth about that.
I don't know. I'm not sure. Maybe. Hmm.

1470
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:40,960
I wonder. It's interesting when
you see that though. I mean,

1471
01:23:40,961 --> 01:23:44,290
he's got to be really fascinating for
you to come from our American culture and

1472
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:47,800
be immersed in their culture for three
weeks. I've never done that before.

1473
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:50,410
It was cool.
I've been to Brazil for a few days,

1474
01:23:50,411 --> 01:23:52,840
but a lot of Brazilian speak
English and like seven, eight,

1475
01:23:52,841 --> 01:23:55,990
nine days though it started to become
like normalized a little bit and there was

1476
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,190
like a really observed stuff.

1477
01:23:57,191 --> 01:24:00,460
Plus I got a little lonely so I can
make friends easier once you need to.

1478
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:03,910
Did you stay,
how long did you stay in the same place?

1479
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:08,540
Shanghai was the first night I went to
like suburbs of Shanghai for for a few

1480
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:10,030
days and then back to
Shanghai for two days.

1481
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,760
They have a proper club called
comfort comedy, which is like, listen,

1482
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:16,780
you proper st proper like an Englishman.
But I mean it's like,

1483
01:24:16,781 --> 01:24:18,180
it works as a club.
There's one room,

1484
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:22,240
it looks like the belly room and it's
just like, oh, this is a cool place. Wow.

1485
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:25,990
Other places were bars where they try
to set it up, you know? That's cool man.

1486
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:28,360
It's all these experts who need something.
English speaking,

1487
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:31,270
it's kind of like the Uso tours you'd
ever hear about that where they're like

1488
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:36,100
always really thankful. It's like that,
you know hecklers. They're just so happy.

1489
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:37,780
There's English speaking comedy.

1490
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:41,860
And how many of those people knew you from
online? Zero? No, no, no, no, not zero.

1491
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:46,360
Like a couple people were just there
because they're checking out new comics

1492
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:48,740
that come into town every week. Some
was like, man, I'm a big fan of yours.

1493
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:49,610
Like oh thanks.
Cause yeah,

1494
01:24:49,611 --> 01:24:52,870
I check out those videos on the
website that they showed. I was like,

1495
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:55,140
oh that means you saw who was
playing and then you watch TV.

1496
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:59,170
You're not a big fan. That's okay.
But came a big fan of super recently.

1497
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:03,490
It was like, it wasn't like excited.
There was some like a podcast listeners,

1498
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:08,890
you know a few here or there.
That one show second. I had
like seven or eight. Wow.

1499
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:13,030
Couple of Shanghai's just
developing a reputation like this.

1500
01:25:13,031 --> 01:25:15,880
These scenes are developing reputation
for bringing funny people around.

1501
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:17,900
So folks just come out to
see who the new guy is.

1502
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:21,550
Like once a month they could bring in an
out of towner. Wow. And the scene starts.

1503
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:24,920
But you can only do the room like twice
with any joke before the like, yeah,

1504
01:25:24,921 --> 01:25:26,330
we've all seen it, man. Oh,

1505
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:31,350
drawing from the city of 50,000 tops in
a city of 24 million is 50,000 English

1506
01:25:31,481 --> 01:25:35,680
speakers. So do they write a lot there? I
have to, but you know the open mic days,

1507
01:25:35,681 --> 01:25:37,390
that's how you did anyway.
You'd write it a lot.

1508
01:25:37,391 --> 01:25:39,540
Every week it'd be like
performed from the same guys.

1509
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,393
Got to come from their joke.

1510
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,390
That's the worst when it's
almost all comics in the room.

1511
01:25:43,391 --> 01:25:44,830
Kind of just a couple of audience members,

1512
01:25:44,831 --> 01:25:48,220
but the comics of all senior ship
before you can even do an a tagline,

1513
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,680
we're not going with you for seven
minutes for your one new bit. Yeah.

1514
01:25:50,681 --> 01:25:52,540
You're barely new tagline.

1515
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:55,700
It's just a better version of an
old tagline and you can't do it.

1516
01:25:55,701 --> 01:26:00,250
You see when your tagline,
it's not really, it's just
better. It's not that new.

1517
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:04,060
It's just, I've seen your act a
hundred times, just riffing up there.

1518
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,780
That's the worst though.
When you're the fucking,

1519
01:26:06,781 --> 01:26:09,860
and there's no one in the audience.
It's beaten down and tired and you know,

1520
01:26:09,861 --> 01:26:13,230
there's more comics in the
audience and the audiences. Yeah.

1521
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:17,800
So Shanghai's just emerging
and they have a city outside.

1522
01:26:17,801 --> 01:26:21,190
They like like a 40 minute bullet train
outside. They're called pseudo. Ooh,

1523
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:25,520
that had the spill. Small town
feel. 10 million people. Oh my God.

1524
01:26:25,521 --> 01:26:29,240
A small town. Everything
closed early. That's insane.

1525
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:31,030
10 million people and
everything's closed her own. Yeah.

1526
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:34,390
So is that like Chicago
sized? 10 million. It's Beth.

1527
01:26:34,391 --> 01:26:37,640
Bigger than Manhattan in Shanghai.
I mean, so Joe [inaudible] Joe is,

1528
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,180
when they say Manhattan, did they, the
[inaudible] on the island. The island.

1529
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:42,380
We're not talking about
the actual full state.

1530
01:26:42,381 --> 01:26:45,770
Do they ever actually say that or did
they say New York City Tri Burrows or

1531
01:26:45,771 --> 01:26:47,360
something? He said things
that, I don't know.

1532
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:50,630
I don't know what New York City
means. The five boroughs. Yeah.

1533
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:55,280
It's not Triborough. It's five,
right? It's Long Island Queens,

1534
01:26:55,490 --> 01:27:00,370
Brooklyn, Staten Island with
Manheim. Breaux Bridge set it. Yeah,

1535
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,830
I say it. I don't know what
the fuck one, I don't know.

1536
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:09,890
I never know if they're just talking
about only the island of Manhattan or the

1537
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:12,620
Greater New York.
Like what someone says New York City.

1538
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:17,570
The Bronx is New York City. Van Nuys is
part of La. Yeah. Right, right. Yeah.

1539
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,260
To be in like just their sort of,
it's sort of the same kind of thing,

1540
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:24,410
but if you picture just meant hat
this is bigger than that. Whoa.

1541
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:27,500
That's also a lot of people. I remember
the first time I came to Manhattan,

1542
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,480
I was driving from Boston.

1543
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:33,350
I think I'd been there once
before for a karate tournament,

1544
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:38,240
but I was like 16 I didn't really remember
it that much and somebody else was

1545
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:41,480
driving know. It was like one of those
experiences. It was really young,

1546
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:46,610
so I was there for a comedy and the first
time I drove I drove up the west side

1547
01:27:46,611 --> 01:27:49,220
highway and there was the, there was
the first time I ever saw the skyline,

1548
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,750
which is pretty dramatic on the
west side. I went, he's like,

1549
01:27:51,751 --> 01:27:54,380
I like the death star. I was like,
this is the craziest thing I've ever,

1550
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:58,700
I was so intimidated. It's
pretty big show. Intimidating,
overwhelming. I was like,

1551
01:27:58,701 --> 01:28:03,590
God, believe how big this city is sane.
When they got back up to three weeks,

1552
01:28:03,591 --> 01:28:08,360
it was like, oh yeah. I was like,
fuck. I meant all those buildings.

1553
01:28:08,361 --> 01:28:12,110
It's a menu. It's just insanity. Did
you feel that when you were in China,

1554
01:28:12,111 --> 01:28:15,650
was there, yeah. Which places
out to it? They had it. They had,

1555
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,770
they needed a financial district.
And so they had all these rice patties,

1556
01:28:18,771 --> 01:28:22,220
like right across the field that 20 years
ago, all rice patties. And they're like,

1557
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:26,000
let's make a financial district. And
there's now this 50 skyscrapers. Whoa.

1558
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,250
They just filled them in.
They don't have to like vote.

1559
01:28:28,251 --> 01:28:29,420
They don't have two referendums.

1560
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:32,180
They don't have to wait
until it's an election year
show. They're doing anything.

1561
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:37,310
Did you go any of the cities
that were crazy polluted?
Shanghai? How bad? It's bad.

1562
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:39,150
It's bad.
I wasn't there.

1563
01:28:39,151 --> 01:28:42,830
And one of those awful days where Dez
bishop at that the Irish guy in Beijing is

1564
01:28:42,831 --> 01:28:46,760
not as bad as Shanghai, but it's still
real bad. He says, um, I mean everywhere.

1565
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:49,040
Where's mass tons of people where mass,
not everyone,

1566
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,830
40% of the people where mass.
Whoa. They see what the,

1567
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,190
everyone has an app on their
phone for pollution. Uh,

1568
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:57,170
and so I was in the unhealthy range
pretty much while I was there.

1569
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,240
But if he gets a worse than that,
he goes, you wake up in the morning,

1570
01:28:59,241 --> 01:29:03,540
you felt like you smoked all night so
the APP recognizes the air or tells you

1571
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:06,720
what the quality is.
So then they won't like bike to work.

1572
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:09,810
If it's real bad they'll take
across motherfucker. Yeah.

1573
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:12,360
So you have tissue papers,

1574
01:29:12,361 --> 01:29:15,970
they give you the pitch everyone
has at all times to wipe it. Yeah.

1575
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,150
Cause after SARS everyone
started wearing like,

1576
01:29:18,151 --> 01:29:20,100
people look concerned with
spreading it to others too.

1577
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:22,500
So there's no spitting allowed anymore.

1578
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,220
Do you know that there's a spread of
murders? It's going on now. Oh yeah.

1579
01:29:26,221 --> 01:29:28,530
That signs up for that at every
train station. They're like,

1580
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:32,460
do not bring anything else in. We didn't
want dumping your fucking chickens in.

1581
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:37,680
Yup. Livestock. Yeah. Uh, people
kiss their livestock sometimes.

1582
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:41,400
Really. Dude's kiss their
camels. Try and get you guys,

1583
01:29:41,401 --> 01:29:45,830
stop kissing their camera guys, people
are dying. Fuck you're superstitious.

1584
01:29:45,831 --> 01:29:49,290
Don't be kissing you Campbell anymore.
And then riding on a train.

1585
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:52,110
Superstitious. And what? I mean,

1586
01:29:52,111 --> 01:29:55,860
how long does it take before
like some of the more ridiculous,

1587
01:29:55,861 --> 01:30:00,600
we were talking earlier about the ideas
of kosher original origins for it.

1588
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:02,840
We're pretty, pretty smart. Oh, well,

1589
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:05,940
it's pretty smart to not eat pigs if all
these people are dying and getting sick,

1590
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:09,870
but how long does it take for those?
Just totally go away. How long before?

1591
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:12,420
We have no superstitions. Right?
A hundred years. I don't know.

1592
01:30:12,421 --> 01:30:15,150
New ones will come in, do you think so?
Throwing the salt over the shoulder,

1593
01:30:15,151 --> 01:30:19,680
one of that come, that's
not, not everybody does some
asshole. That's some asshole.

1594
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:24,270
Yeah. That what? When do you think
that that ends in 500 years from now?

1595
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:28,170
Hopefully it'll be done by that. God,
hopefully it's got to happen. Right?

1596
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:30,120
It seems like we're moving that way,

1597
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:33,420
but it's natural to feel like every time
I would do that growing up, I'd be like,

1598
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:37,200
I just believed in southern
superstitions that I thought of. Yeah.

1599
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:39,540
I did touch like we all did it.
It was like a thing.

1600
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:43,020
You ever do one of those things where
if I step on this crack, oh yeah,

1601
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:46,160
whole family might die.
My mom's back broke. Yeah.

1602
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:49,020
Or you try to avoid that old boy
cracks for whatever reason. Yeah.

1603
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:51,510
Like really keep, I was like,
why? What are you doing? Well,

1604
01:30:51,511 --> 01:30:55,080
when you confused about the nature of
reality, you think it's very mystical.

1605
01:30:55,081 --> 01:30:57,920
Maybe this, I control it. No,
that's not, you control it. Well,

1606
01:30:57,930 --> 01:31:01,440
I've always wondered if like the real
origins for superstitions like that and

1607
01:31:01,441 --> 01:31:06,441
children are that children have a more
honest awareness of the nature of reality

1608
01:31:06,481 --> 01:31:11,400
itself is that it's malleable and then
things you can alter the way things go,

1609
01:31:11,401 --> 01:31:14,820
but you want to feel about in stupid
ways like stepping on a crack. Right?

1610
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:19,050
But it might be the way you act or think
or behave and you feel that you sense

1611
01:31:19,051 --> 01:31:22,890
it, but you can't sort of communicate it
correctly as the thoughts and process.

1612
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:24,570
It can't put it into context.

1613
01:31:24,571 --> 01:31:28,580
So instead you worry about stepping on
cracks and breaking people's backs. You,

1614
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:32,670
you feel this sense that you
have some sort of a weird,

1615
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,860
weird ability to affect.

1616
01:31:34,861 --> 01:31:37,790
And change your destiny based on
decisions that you make? Yeah.

1617
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:40,980
When the cat goes across
the street in front of you,

1618
01:31:40,981 --> 01:31:44,380
do you still get at least like
you think about an egg ladder?

1619
01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:45,690
When I say a ladder,
I'll,

1620
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:47,790
I'll usually move around it
the other way instead of like,

1621
01:31:47,791 --> 01:31:50,940
what the fuck does this matter? Well,
here's a perfect example of that.

1622
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:54,240
I was kind of superstitious
when I was a kid,

1623
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:57,540
but I've always loved cats and I've
always had cats and nobody's a black cats,

1624
01:31:57,570 --> 01:32:00,130
so I never got a fuck about black hats.
So when a black cat,

1625
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:03,250
we'll go across the street. I would never
think, oh my God, I'm fucked. I'd be like,

1626
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:05,860
fuck you. That's the
cat. It's just a cat man.

1627
01:32:05,861 --> 01:32:10,270
Give that cat a little bowl of tuna
fish and Pettit. Be Perin just the cat.

1628
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:14,230
But a stray cat is bad luck. He's a
fucking animal. He's having a good time.

1629
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:19,690
Southern White Guy made that thing up.
Probably about the black hat. It's racist.

1630
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,630
I think it's just a fear thing.

1631
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:26,590
I think people are afraid because
remember that's witches, right? Black hat.

1632
01:32:27,190 --> 01:32:30,800
If you were scared of what we can't see.
Yeah.

1633
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:34,660
Some fucking glowing eyes running
across the road in front of your car.

1634
01:32:34,661 --> 01:32:37,950
Cause it's about a car,
right, isn't it? What?

1635
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:41,790
No black cat crosses your path. You got
a bicycle. What do you want to walk in?

1636
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,840
Just walk in anytime they're
walking in front of you. That too.

1637
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:46,450
I was thinking of it because the
whole Disney thing with that with a

1638
01:32:46,451 --> 01:32:48,340
superstitious guy.
Somebody. What are those?

1639
01:32:48,341 --> 01:32:52,480
Umbrella canes and he like moves the cap
backwards so it won't. So even walking,

1640
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:54,840
do you think that's when it
was created or was it click?

1641
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,680
It was created then for walking days maybe
a horses would freak out and they see

1642
01:32:57,681 --> 01:33:00,650
a cat run across when people are
possibly blend into the shadows.

1643
01:33:00,651 --> 01:33:04,720
So it just saw and people fell and
got fucked up. So now I get it out.

1644
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:09,160
Fat could be it or you can't shit
your pants and fall on your rake.

1645
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,230
Yeah, you fucking die cause
you don't, you don't know it.

1646
01:33:12,231 --> 01:33:15,550
Staph infection in his back
then that's another way to die.

1647
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:20,380
What I saw a guy first day,
whenever someone says, Dude,

1648
01:33:20,381 --> 01:33:21,450
you got to give him the floor.
Brown.

1649
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:26,170
He had this leg that had purple
from like just below the knee,

1650
01:33:26,171 --> 01:33:28,240
all the way to end. This guy, the
guy who was taking over, I was like,

1651
01:33:28,241 --> 01:33:30,010
don't tell him. Look at the, and
I started not looking at like,

1652
01:33:30,011 --> 01:33:31,480
how am I not going to look?
I'm just starting.

1653
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:37,440
It was a purple ring about that big and
inside the proper room was like a yellow

1654
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:42,100
ring and then inside that was
like a little bone. Oh my God.

1655
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:47,230
So it was just eating him up. Yeah.
I mean they're homeless are shit.

1656
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:53,560
Whoa. They didn't have to say anything.
They just let their fucking by show it.

1657
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:55,540
They don't tell it. Oh my God. Yeah,

1658
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:58,570
but they don't have much homeless.

1659
01:33:58,571 --> 01:34:01,610
That was the only guy I ever saw in
Shanghai that was homeless for these

1660
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:06,140
catalytic cigs excuse. Yeah. Your
leg is wasting away. What do you do?

1661
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:07,870
Like he ain't get amazed.
Probably already did.

1662
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,860
Did you have a new found appreciation
for America when you relay ended and now

1663
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:15,880
you ready to say a pledge of allegiance?
Right. I'll tell you what, bad.

1664
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:20,070
There were some things where I felt
a lot more free in China by a beer.

1665
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:23,350
Walked down the street and drink it like
uptown New Orleans. Go to New Orleans.

1666
01:34:23,351 --> 01:34:27,640
It could be a brand new Orleans. Not
really very good joint to think outside.

1667
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:32,240
Don't they stop you outside?
Grinding Vegas come.

1668
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:36,220
It's 40 minutes away from fucking
Burbank's is nice, but it's not a safe,

1669
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:39,310
it's not safe spoken joint.
They don't know what weed smells like.

1670
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:42,160
Cops have no reference point.
It's what are you talking about?

1671
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:43,990
Have no reference point. They don't
know what it smells like. Now.

1672
01:34:43,991 --> 01:34:47,620
I just solved the whole puzzle.
They don't know what it even smells like.

1673
01:34:47,621 --> 01:34:48,850
Countries.
She's confused as fuck.

1674
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,270
Did you imagine they'd kept weed from the
whole country? There's so little of it.

1675
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:55,930
Wow. That's amazing. What would happen
if we spread through their country?

1676
01:34:55,931 --> 01:34:57,860
Like wow, you got it. Have it. Yeah.

1677
01:34:57,861 --> 01:35:00,320
But what would happen if we'd spread
throughout the country at Clark like

1678
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:01,154
wildfire.

1679
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:06,320
If Archie fear became a weed evangelists
for China and got it going but not

1680
01:35:06,321 --> 01:35:09,200
there. Don't go there. Do it all through
email. Oh yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1681
01:35:09,201 --> 01:35:12,350
You don't want to act. That's still
fucking answer you dude. They'll get,

1682
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:13,700
you don't test them.

1683
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,750
They're going to fight tooth and
nail to keep their silly cultures,

1684
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,520
keep kissing their camels and shit.

1685
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:23,360
Throw you in a hole for like
ever fucking camels, man.

1686
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:27,220
Kids shouldn't the streets murderers,
the kids shit in the streets.

1687
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:31,300
They're pants are cut down the middle. So
that allows them to, oh my God, no way.

1688
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:33,720
Loose shorts like sports and then,

1689
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:37,160
and then if they're at squatting you
can just see their little dicks and they

1690
01:35:37,161 --> 01:35:39,770
train their kids.
I saw one of them and like a market,

1691
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:42,710
she was looking like motioning to him.
You can tell what motions are, you know,

1692
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:45,640
things are universal. And the kid kept
looking back, confusion cause yeah, yeah,

1693
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:46,483
yeah,
do it.

1694
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:50,840
And he like pulled his pants down and
then he's just pissed industries finally

1695
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:55,550
and was just like, do it in the
street. No, you only saw him pass.

1696
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:57,980
It had to smell like shit. They had
their cut all the way to the back.

1697
01:35:57,981 --> 01:36:01,460
They're just allowed to shit that stink.
Yeah.

1698
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:03,200
The bathroom smells so bad.

1699
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:08,060
The bathroom smells so bad from pollution.
I think just from the polluted water.

1700
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:11,990
Just polluted water makes it smell wine.
And also they don't, they don't want,

1701
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:16,340
you can't even say it. Look at him.
He just died thinking about it.

1702
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:21,690
They have a lot of toilets.
Was just no toilet. Just a
porcelain hole. The shy one.

1703
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:25,100
Yeah, you have to. Squat is
a squat. It's supposed to.

1704
01:36:25,101 --> 01:36:27,110
That's better for your bowels supposedly

1705
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:36,680
pose it.
I was in the Forbidden City.

1706
01:36:36,681 --> 01:36:41,360
I was walking around there, the
emperor's palace and I got bad diarrhea.

1707
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:44,390
It was bad. Like sweating
like I gotta fuck, fuck.

1708
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:48,930
And then there's a picture toilet and you,
you go in there and you fucking raw.

1709
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:51,140
It smells.
As soon as you cross the threshold or the,

1710
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:54,470
the smells horrible and you open
up the first toy, the stall door,

1711
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:56,630
and your mind can't even
register it at first.

1712
01:36:56,630 --> 01:37:00,410
Like this must be at a construction
now cause there's no toilet here.

1713
01:37:00,411 --> 01:37:02,120
So that's the only explanation.
Oh,

1714
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:07,130
and then you go to the next one and
you're like, what? Oh, zip paper rock. No,

1715
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:12,050
there's no paper. What? Yeah. Well
first I just said, I'm not doing this.

1716
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:15,080
I'm not. I walked away.
Oh my God. I was like,

1717
01:37:15,081 --> 01:37:17,450
I want to look like two steps out of
the bathroom. And I was like, Oh yeah,

1718
01:37:17,451 --> 01:37:19,790
diarrhea. What do you mean I'm not
doing it? Of course I'm doing it.

1719
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,860
So you went back in and wash your butt.
You have to do,

1720
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:27,200
so this guy who owned the own, the bar,
the club was in Shanghai, gave me this,

1721
01:37:27,201 --> 01:37:29,930
these, this tissue packet,
and he goes, you'll need it.

1722
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:34,780
I thought it was for pollution. And he
goes, you'll need this. And I just had it.

1723
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:36,950
Yeah. And then it was like, oh yeah,

1724
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:40,760
but you got to pull your pants
all the way down. Squat over it,

1725
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:45,290
but also try not to shit into your pants.
Oh,

1726
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:49,880
you can't go over the balls of your feet?
Oh No, there's probably a better way.

1727
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:52,040
What do you do with
explosive diarrhea though?

1728
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:55,350
It seems like you're going to miss lasted
into that hole. You're, you're, you're,

1729
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:59,340
you're like half a foot over the hole.
Is that good for your quads?

1730
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:01,350
It's good for your core.
That definitely

1731
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:08,040
I would feel like that would really
work your core a lot and there's no air

1732
01:38:08,041 --> 01:38:11,080
conditioning. It's so hot. That
would work. You're resolved.

1733
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:15,260
That's why the issue is a thing. Maybe
it's not the low sugar diet shit. Shit,

1734
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:18,450
your hit your ankle. So cause I'm going
to have explosive diarrhea. It was like,

1735
01:38:18,451 --> 01:38:22,350
I'm just going to hit my picture.
This picture, this I'm down. Okay.

1736
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:25,770
Swatting right now. So like
your, your ass is right.

1737
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:28,860
It's all over the whole filling
the hole essentially feed.

1738
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:32,100
If you're moved far enough away,
what do you do if you have bad knees?

1739
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:36,900
Oh you do after that.
But I sit like that all the time.

1740
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,730
That's how I usually just squat, eat
all the time. I do that sometimes.

1741
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:46,530
It's like that. Yeah, sure. Once in a
while back, it's just happening to China.

1742
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:47,970
In one of those toilets,

1743
01:38:47,971 --> 01:38:52,140
somebody dropped her brand new phone in
the toilet and so the husband went to go

1744
01:38:52,141 --> 01:38:53,280
in there and grab it.

1745
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:57,850
He passed out because of the fumes and
the woman tried to grab the guy out.

1746
01:38:57,851 --> 01:39:00,090
She passed out. She passed
out. Two people died.

1747
01:39:00,091 --> 01:39:03,670
Three injured falling in stand by me with,

1748
01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:08,380
they're all barfing smell
fucking, yeah, we have it.

1749
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:11,520
So good. America, Dick Cheney's,
right. They have those.

1750
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:15,480
They have the shitters on the train
when it's moving around and stuff.

1751
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:20,230
They have those shitters Dick Cheney's.
Right. I open up my tissue packets. What?

1752
01:39:20,231 --> 01:39:22,190
What did he say?
Just right.

1753
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:27,370
It sounds like at first I was kind
of jealous, but now I don't want to,

1754
01:39:27,371 --> 01:39:30,780
you would never even go there because
even real toilets like in this hotel,

1755
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,710
it was fine. In the bars is fine, but
like a lot of places just don't know.

1756
01:39:34,711 --> 01:39:38,640
It's going to be one of those,
it's like six or seven tissues in there.

1757
01:39:38,641 --> 01:39:41,460
So suddenly you're like got a
budget. Prostitutes, hot chicks.

1758
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:42,541
How was that part of it?

1759
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:45,570
Did you see prostitutes and I
went to the area in Hong Kong.

1760
01:39:45,571 --> 01:39:48,570
I didn't got any right, but I went to
the area in Hong Kong. They grab at,

1761
01:39:48,571 --> 01:39:52,770
you really want your business now.
A couple of them are hot.

1762
01:39:52,771 --> 01:39:56,610
A lot of them were just like older
Chinese ladies that look weathered. Ooh,

1763
01:39:57,810 --> 01:40:01,920
Ooh. Here's some interesting Hong
Kong. They don't call it China.

1764
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:03,870
You've got to use your
visa to go between them.

1765
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:06,370
We didn't know it's been given back.
It hasn't been fully giving back yet.

1766
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:10,350
It used to be English. Yeah, for a
hundred years. Well, how did they give up?

1767
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,390
How do they let that happen?
How did what?

1768
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:16,560
They said that we'd get it for 150 years
of Puerto Rican Zass for Puerto Rico

1769
01:40:16,561 --> 01:40:20,970
back. We'd be like, no way. But that was
always the deal. We want Hawaii back.

1770
01:40:20,971 --> 01:40:23,670
They've wanted Hawaii back forever.
No, you're not getting that back.

1771
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:27,900
We want to take less cook. No, I want
ask. It should be its own country,

1772
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:30,990
but at this point, at this point of
China was like, if Britain was like, no,

1773
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:31,890
you don't get it back to,
I was like,

1774
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:35,430
you really want to do this because
if you want to go, we'll go, go.

1775
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:38,280
We'll go in a crazy, we signed
a contract. We'll abide by that,

1776
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:41,490
but it's time to lose faith,
but all the Hong Kong people,

1777
01:40:41,491 --> 01:40:44,310
they look at the mainlanders
mainlanders look an insult.

1778
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,620
They look at them as like the
garbage people. Really? Yeah.

1779
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:48,540
They'll look the whole thing.

1780
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:53,540
I'll shit and malls and the carry fucking
raw turkeys in their bags and they go

1781
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:56,590
all the murders. That's
all them. Whoa. Oh yeah.

1782
01:40:56,591 --> 01:41:00,540
They will view with them is like no
real underlings. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

1783
01:41:00,570 --> 01:41:03,700
I was told that, that it was
racist. It gets other Chinese,
but I was like, no way.

1784
01:41:03,701 --> 01:41:07,920
How can it be? You know? I was like,
wow, you're right. Deeply, deeply. Whoa.

1785
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:12,550
Like the north. But think of like the
south, but way worse than that. Wow. Yeah.

1786
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:15,370
I'll tell you what, if there's,
if, if someone's shit it them all,

1787
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:20,470
it was a mainlander. Whoa.
Yeah. That's just, it doesn't
mean they're all like that,

1788
01:41:20,471 --> 01:41:24,220
but that's, that thinking comes from
there. What seems like their reality?

1789
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:27,220
It's just far more sparse.
There's far,

1790
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:31,090
far fewer resources to many people.

1791
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:34,210
Well what is it that's causing
them to behave in such a,

1792
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:37,270
well they had a lot of revolution in
the last, like not that many years.

1793
01:41:37,271 --> 01:41:37,961
Like the old people,

1794
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:40,690
they walk around like you know that walk
where they put your hand behind your

1795
01:41:40,691 --> 01:41:44,800
back last bit and just like stroll to
like none of my friends are getting shot

1796
01:41:44,801 --> 01:41:48,220
in the face, you know, at a firing squad.

1797
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:52,030
Like they've lived through some bad times.
So they're calm. Yeah. They're like,

1798
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:53,050
we're safe.

1799
01:41:53,170 --> 01:41:56,830
They're baiting you with Kamora actually
they tried to get you to go into it.

1800
01:41:56,860 --> 01:42:00,250
If you go to that Kamora a lot of guys
have a good defense and they know that

1801
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:04,270
set up that far side on Barb control,
the body will just trip you,

1802
01:42:04,271 --> 01:42:08,170
get you to the ground. I don't know
what that is. I don't know what it is.

1803
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:12,190
Hong Kong is pretty built up to. Hmm.
That's fascinating. Were all bankers.

1804
01:42:12,191 --> 01:42:13,480
It's the English influence.

1805
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,710
So the English influence was
it to the side of the street?

1806
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:20,380
They drive and China drives I guess.
Yeah,

1807
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:23,410
except they don't drive like pedestrians.

1808
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:26,770
I mean it's like if you're crossing
the street like this and you know that

1809
01:42:26,771 --> 01:42:30,310
making a right turn. If they see a hole,
they go figure it out for their car.

1810
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:31,144
They're taking it.

1811
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:34,630
Those mopeds is shooting in and out
through traffic through like pedestrians.

1812
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:37,420
How many people get hit? They said
tons all the time. I didn't see any,

1813
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:42,220
but they say tons. Fuck that.
Could you walk across that shit?

1814
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:45,850
Oh all the time. Oh my gosh. Just
keep walking and no, you see me,

1815
01:42:45,851 --> 01:42:50,190
you're gonna move or you see my angle.
You want to like stop and throw it off.

1816
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:53,650
Give them timing. You just get, yeah,
just got to trust the same page.

1817
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:56,230
Just trust him not to hit. You got to
trust their timing. Yeah. They're like,

1818
01:42:56,231 --> 01:42:58,600
they see where you are. I see where you're
not going to be in like two seconds.

1819
01:42:58,601 --> 01:42:59,770
I'll go where you are now.
Don't,

1820
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:03,660
don't stop walking the main
street in characters while
they're driving like that.

1821
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:07,360
Could you imagine they're texting must
be so much more complicated than ours.

1822
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:10,450
They're drawing out a picture. They
do texting characters. Oh my God.

1823
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:13,690
So they texting characters
and they all at night,

1824
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:17,860
especially the cab drivers to save
battery. They'll turn off their lights,

1825
01:43:17,861 --> 01:43:19,030
they'll drive it,

1826
01:43:23,390 --> 01:43:27,380
drive without that lights it all. But
the darkest cloud is nights. Oh my God,

1827
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:31,070
my in the city you can pretty much see,
hey,

1828
01:43:31,071 --> 01:43:34,450
you're just walking across the street and
you have to hope that they can see you

1829
01:43:34,451 --> 01:43:35,830
well enough to time you.

1830
01:43:36,430 --> 01:43:39,610
I have such bad ideas about they'll turn
off their motor at red lights because I

1831
01:43:39,611 --> 01:43:44,030
think that saves. Oh God.
Well it does. We're good.

1832
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:48,370
No it doesn't. No. It's a new
feature and a lot of cars,

1833
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:53,070
what they shut off at stoplights,
really. Portions have it and it doesn't.

1834
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:54,980
Doesn't that take the most
gas to start up again?

1835
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:57,650
It's like in an instance startup again,
the the,

1836
01:43:57,660 --> 01:44:02,660
the engine goes into like some sort
of sustained hibernation or some shit,

1837
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,840
but it essentially shuts the engine off.
It's an option though.

1838
01:44:05,841 --> 01:44:09,140
You can turn it off or on and it's
how they beat emission standards.

1839
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:13,210
Like they want to like push us
over time. It doesn't, yeah.

1840
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,050
Maybe for every five minutes were worse,

1841
01:44:15,051 --> 01:44:17,000
but over like 10 minutes
where we're better.

1842
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:19,760
If you read those things
where it says like how much,

1843
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:22,340
what's the miles per gallon
that like a car gets?

1844
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:25,640
That's the only driving
like a really sane,

1845
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:28,040
calm person that doesn't take any risks.

1846
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:33,130
You're driving like super slow.
You're observing the speed limit.

1847
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:38,140
You slowly accelerate up to
whatever speed you want to go to.

1848
01:44:38,730 --> 01:44:43,370
Look at that. Look at that. That's across
the street. That is fucking insane.

1849
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:46,340
That's just across the street is fucking

1850
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:50,800
crosswalk. Oh my God.
That is fucking, man.

1851
01:44:50,801 --> 01:44:54,320
It was just white paint on a road that's
got nothing to do with me is fucking

1852
01:44:54,321 --> 01:44:58,730
inspiring. Wow. It's hard
to watch. I get anxiety.

1853
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:02,630
So many of those mopeds too. I remember
one of those fucking drunk late at night.

1854
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,810
You that was suck.
Hard to

1855
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:10,850
solid Jude come close at all. Did
anybody come close to hitting? You know,

1856
01:45:10,851 --> 01:45:13,540
I mean it wasn't like I didn't
skim one at all, but I'm at,

1857
01:45:13,541 --> 01:45:17,910
could feel the breeze go by.
Oh my God, definitely. Damn.

1858
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:21,450
Where's your favorite place?
Who um,

1859
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:26,030
I don't know. Hong Kong was a lot of
fun in Shanghai was a lot of fun to

1860
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:32,430
air bell. Yeah, it's cleaner. Definitely.
We went out junk vote and Hong Kong.

1861
01:45:32,470 --> 01:45:34,050
It's like a day before I left.

1862
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:37,730
The day before the last day and a
just jumped off into the, into the,

1863
01:45:37,731 --> 01:45:39,800
like the bay and stuff.
It was fucking awesome.

1864
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:44,450
So does essentially just different, but
both. Cool. Both. Cool. Fuck it. Swam.

1865
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:47,660
That's a perfect mix of like beer,
Thai food.

1866
01:45:47,661 --> 01:45:50,720
A little bit of acid and just fucking
jelly fish came up at some point.

1867
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:55,520
And you went in the ocean. Yeah.
Wow. Food, beer and acid fish.

1868
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:58,040
Yeah. The jellyfish came out and
they've got a little more dangerous,

1869
01:45:58,041 --> 01:46:01,370
but we just kept jumping in and of
jellyfish. Get you, you're fucked.

1870
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:05,190
You just in a lot of pain for two
days, two days. Guardian and I,

1871
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:09,710
my ex had it on her neck and it was
just this huge like really burned how to

1872
01:46:09,711 --> 01:46:11,680
like get it out.
You've got to take a credit card loads.

1873
01:46:12,150 --> 01:46:16,790
That's the hottest pot loads.
That's what loads do.

1874
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:21,200
They burn you for about six months. They
mark you up. Nobody else can get you.

1875
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:25,730
They don't swim really fast
though. Let's go fast. Go Fast Bro.

1876
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:29,120
You don't know. You don't
know Mike? Just line.

1877
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:31,910
There's a wine Australia that
kills people on a regular basis.

1878
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:34,850
Really kills people.
Have they have these um,

1879
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:38,870
these emergency stations that they have
set up on the beach where they have

1880
01:46:38,871 --> 01:46:43,830
these giant jugs of vinegar.
Vinegar? Yeah. He pour it on like,

1881
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,890
yeah, it'd be they let
go or something. I Dunno.

1882
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,010
I think I should probably Google that.
There's one comic,

1883
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,670
Sean got guts done the year before

1884
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:53,910
and they said they had to pee in
a cup and then pour it over it.

1885
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:56,570
But then they said they found out later.
That's not the way that,

1886
01:46:56,640 --> 01:47:01,310
that's actually not a thing. Uh, yeah.
Australia has a lot of shows. Really.

1887
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:06,900
How far was trying to from Australia,
it's not that far.

1888
01:47:06,930 --> 01:47:09,630
It's not as far as we are from Australia.
I don't think from Sydney.

1889
01:47:10,170 --> 01:47:14,910
I think they're closer to
Sydney then we are really south,

1890
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:18,360
but like straight down south,
there's a ton of Asian than Australia.

1891
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:22,470
There's a box jellyfish. It's no bigger
than your finger nail can kill you.

1892
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:26,850
That's hard to spot even when you
haven't bitten your nails lately.

1893
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:31,530
No bigger than your fingernail
and it can kill you.

1894
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:35,570
I gotta pee real bad. Go Pee. I'm
freaking out about a box. Jellyfish

1895
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:42,300
matchstick. Wow. Look at that shit.
Brion pull that shit up. Box Jellyfish.

1896
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:44,880
Just pull up box jellyfish.

1897
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:48,750
No bigger than your fingernail can kill
you in the blink of an eye. By the way,

1898
01:47:49,410 --> 01:47:50,460
mother fucker.

1899
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:54,700
Just when I was starting
to relax or is this live?

1900
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:57,960
Is it really Australia,
man? Wow. Look at that.

1901
01:48:00,150 --> 01:48:02,130
Look at that shit.
That's how big that is.

1902
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:06,150
Size of a God damn fingernail
and it can kill you in seconds.

1903
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:10,770
That is not cool.
Upon further research.

1904
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:15,510
This itty bitty jelly is so cute
that it might kill you. No, really,

1905
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:19,880
and not from the sheer adorableness of it,
but from it's insanely poisoned.

1906
01:48:19,881 --> 01:48:20,714
His sting,

1907
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:25,760
the species box jellyfish was
described as recently as 2007 wow.

1908
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:28,230
So they didn't know about it.

1909
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:33,650
The species of box jellyfish was described
as recently as 2007 after a 44 year

1910
01:48:35,281 --> 01:48:36,330
old American tourist,

1911
01:48:36,331 --> 01:48:40,980
of course by the name of Robert King
was swimming in Australia waters and

1912
01:48:40,981 --> 01:48:44,430
encounter this minute box jellyfish.

1913
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:46,950
He was stung and died soon after.

1914
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:51,480
That's where the name of
common king slayer comes from.

1915
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:55,080
After Robert King, that's
the guy's name. Wow.

1916
01:48:55,830 --> 01:49:00,830
They called this fucking jellyfish I
king slayer because it killed this guy

1917
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:02,550
named Robert King.

1918
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:08,090
They didn't know about this jellyfish
until 2007 so this guy's got stung.

1919
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:11,380
He died from a tiny jelly fish.
They didn't even know of this.

1920
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:15,000
Spot it size of your fingernail. Look
at it, look at the images of it. Brian,

1921
01:49:15,001 --> 01:49:17,850
pull up some of the images. There's some
of them where they have one in a test,

1922
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:22,560
a little tiny test tube and it's all
over Australia. Especially Sydney.

1923
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:25,090
He's just done. I don't know where it
is, man. I'm just making shit up. Oh,

1924
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:28,230
but it's in Australia somewhere.
Especially sitting there cause you know

1925
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:32,830
I'm looking at the size of that.
You see how tiny it is? Wow.

1926
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:33,870
That thing can kill you.

1927
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:38,790
And it didn't kill a guy until 2007 and
so they decided to call it the common

1928
01:49:38,791 --> 01:49:40,770
king slayer.
That's what it's called now.

1929
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:44,350
That's pretty wild because it killed
a guy named Robert King. It's,

1930
01:49:44,351 --> 01:49:45,840
he didn't kill anybody till then.
Nope.

1931
01:49:46,270 --> 01:49:48,040
We didn't even know about
contact with humans.

1932
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,500
They never knew about it.
Oh I like this. This is,

1933
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:55,170
this is from a box jellyfish
mother fucker things.

1934
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:59,740
Oh my God, is it this one
girl? It wrapped around.

1935
01:49:59,741 --> 01:50:01,870
It didn't just thinking it wasn't
wrapped around and held on.

1936
01:50:01,871 --> 01:50:04,090
And then all the things,
all the alarms are going into,

1937
01:50:04,350 --> 01:50:08,600
well this is a type of box jellyfish
they've known about box jelly fishes for a

1938
01:50:08,601 --> 01:50:11,280
while,
but this type of box jellyfish,

1939
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:16,410
the common king slayer was discovered as
recently first described as recently as

1940
01:50:16,411 --> 01:50:20,640
2007 wow. So they didn't know about
it until this guy got fucked up by it.

1941
01:50:20,750 --> 01:50:21,583
Oh,

1942
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:26,260
Steve Steven went to this beach where
there's just tons of jellyfish and he'd

1943
01:50:26,261 --> 01:50:30,230
just started putting them on his hat head.
Yeah, it's a great video. Check it out.

1944
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:33,890
Yep. How's he know which ones
they are? The fucking guy.

1945
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:38,240
That wild man guide. They would tell him
all the time. Yeah. What was his name?

1946
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:41,990
The old man Manny.
Yeah, maybe it was cool.

1947
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:46,280
Steve O actually put like a
poisonous jellyfish on him.
He got stung for me. Yeah,

1948
01:50:46,290 --> 01:50:50,240
absolutely not like that guy.
I got stung by the box jellyfish box.

1949
01:50:50,241 --> 01:50:53,690
Jellyfish chances in that
show. Yeah. That is so

1950
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:58,500
weird, man. It's so weird that these
things exist that can kill you so easily.

1951
01:50:58,830 --> 01:51:02,360
Oh,
that's so weird.

1952
01:51:03,710 --> 01:51:08,450
It's just weird that these things exist
that have venom in them, you know?

1953
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:13,630
Yeah. There's no antivenom for box
jellyfish. Wow. For these box jellyfish,

1954
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:16,520
a little tiny ones. There's none.
Only symptoms can be treated,

1955
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:20,750
which can last from
hours to, uh, two weeks,

1956
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:25,520
weeks of symptoms if
you live motherfucker.

1957
01:51:28,670 --> 01:51:33,140
Yeah. There's going to be
researching jellyfish in the
next month. This is crazy.

1958
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:36,560
This is really funny.
Part of this is what it does to you.

1959
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:37,460
This is really interesting.

1960
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:41,930
The severe symptoms don't rear their ugly
heads until about five to 120 minutes,

1961
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:46,190
30 minutes. On average.
The, uh, some syndrome,

1962
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:48,890
it's characterized by severe pains
at various parts of the body,

1963
01:51:48,891 --> 01:51:51,710
typically excruciating muscle
cramps in the arms and legs,

1964
01:51:51,711 --> 01:51:54,110
severe pain in the back and kidneys,

1965
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:59,120
a burning sensation of the skin and face
headaches, nausea, restlessness, sweating,

1966
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:03,200
vomiting, increase in heart rate
and blood pressure. And last,

1967
01:52:03,201 --> 01:52:04,250
but certainly not least,

1968
01:52:04,370 --> 01:52:09,370
a psychological phenomenon which can
z consists of the feeling of impending

1969
01:52:09,621 --> 01:52:12,830
doom. Well, it sounds like
with all that other shit,

1970
01:52:12,831 --> 01:52:14,900
of course you would think that it does.
You're dying.

1971
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:18,950
How's that even like an additional,
is it a separate thing? It's no,

1972
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:23,870
it's like you're dying, man. You can jack.
Think about all that shit. Severe pain,

1973
01:52:23,930 --> 01:52:28,430
excruciating muscle cramps, severe pain
and back and kidneys, burning sensation,

1974
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:31,600
skin and face, headaches, nausea.
You know you're dying. Yeah.

1975
01:52:31,970 --> 01:52:34,160
Vomiting your fucking time.
But who wouldn't?

1976
01:52:34,190 --> 01:52:37,280
You'd have to be the cockiest
motherfucker ever to be like, yeah

1977
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:43,160
bro, he's fucking box. Jellyfish ain't
killing me, dude. This is like a,

1978
01:52:43,170 --> 01:52:46,790
it's like a cold. I have cold
grandfather's swimming every day.

1979
01:52:46,791 --> 01:52:50,330
He didn't get a lot of jellyfish.
This is incredible.

1980
01:52:51,850 --> 01:52:54,860
It's scary. It's scary as fuck that nature
creates these little things like that.

1981
01:52:54,861 --> 01:52:59,840
They can just back you just probably
some goldfish to eat it. Fine. Knock,

1982
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:03,140
knock on the sheets off of it. Right.
And it's probably some shitty bird.

1983
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:05,810
We did fish eating, like eating
at one of them and it's trying to,

1984
01:53:05,811 --> 01:53:09,350
it's like trying to get out of there. So
I'd have to dive the, get a jelly fish.

1985
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:12,860
So fish to eat. Jellyfish. Yeah. I
mean it has to be what they created.

1986
01:53:12,861 --> 01:53:16,550
I mean they have to create, it should
avoid preparation. That's a good question.

1987
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:20,960
Souls, they served jellyfish. They served
you a little bit. So the restaurants.

1988
01:53:21,690 --> 01:53:23,330
Yeah, I didn't get any. I
was getting other stuff.

1989
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:26,150
Can we play the WII Istio video or
would that get us Yang from youtube?

1990
01:53:26,660 --> 01:53:29,150
Probably get Yang from youtube.
Steevo went and do this to us.

1991
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:33,620
Who owns this Tivo footage though?
He'll be happy if he should. Yeah. Okay,

1992
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:35,390
let's show it then.
I want to see him get fucked up.

1993
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:39,240
I'm trying to get you ever see the video
of Steevo when he's up in a tree and

1994
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:43,120
lions come up to him that swiping
and barely missing is but no,

1995
01:53:43,170 --> 01:53:45,350
they swabbed his hat.
They took his hat.

1996
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:49,630
He had like one of those Mexican farm
worker hats, you know, Straw hats.

1997
01:53:49,630 --> 01:53:52,030
Those do like to wear and
he's up in this tree and this,

1998
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:55,830
this lion runs up to him in the tray,
just runs up the tree.

1999
01:53:55,831 --> 01:53:59,360
He's checking them out.
Female Lion and she like bites his hat.

2000
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:00,330
She doesn't bite him.

2001
01:54:00,330 --> 01:54:02,450
She bites this hat and he's
like stuck up there on the tray.

2002
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:07,730
It is the most terrifying thing anybody
that I've ever met has ever done.

2003
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:11,420
God was that the guy died, was his buddy
from that show? Wild boy. He was Steve.

2004
01:54:11,421 --> 01:54:16,140
I was alive. No, the other guy,
that's what killed him. No,

2005
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:19,760
he fucking car car. The guy had
died in a car crash was one of the,

2006
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:23,210
the guts from the other show. From Jack
wasn't. Yeah, it wasn't from wild boys.

2007
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:27,980
He died speeding drunk in a Porsche.
Yeah.

2008
01:54:27,990 --> 01:54:29,780
That's what they were not from
all that other crazy shit.

2009
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:32,420
Not from all the other crazy stuff,
but the chances,

2010
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:36,680
I mean they just tell us guys just every
day would risk their lives. I mean,

2011
01:54:36,681 --> 01:54:40,880
that was Johnny Knoxville was the Goddamn
movie star and he's putting a Bandanna

2012
01:54:40,881 --> 01:54:44,630
over his eyes and letting the bowl
thrown through the air. That is the nuts.

2013
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:47,150
Nutty as fuck. Can you talk about
the best comedies? You're like, oh,

2014
01:54:47,151 --> 01:54:49,670
what are the dirty good comments? You
know, maybe you mentioned three or four.

2015
01:54:49,910 --> 01:54:52,970
All three of those jackasses
were fucking awesome. Awesome.

2016
01:54:52,971 --> 01:54:57,260
Just laughs every 10 seconds. Did you
see the new one with the old man? No.

2017
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:02,360
What is it called? GRANDPA. GRANDPA. God
Damn, that's funny. The unedited version.

2018
01:55:02,361 --> 01:55:03,470
Yeah.
If you haven't seen it yet,

2019
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:07,760
it's like the 2.0 or whatever version
you check it out. It's even more worse.

2020
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:11,210
I couldn't even imagine. It could be
better done. Movie was really funny,

2021
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:12,770
like there's some really,
really,

2022
01:55:12,771 --> 01:55:16,070
really funny scenes like Grandpa's stuff
they did and Jack House was awesome.

2023
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:18,650
He's awesome.
Johnny Knoxville is so good.

2024
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:21,410
He was riding that rocket and the thing
went off and blew a hole through the

2025
01:55:21,411 --> 01:55:24,590
metal rocket like right by his
head is like, Whoa, I was so close.

2026
01:55:24,591 --> 01:55:27,680
I would have been gone. Yeah. Could
you imagine if that's how he died?

2027
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:30,840
Rocket to the fucking head on one
of those Shiny Knoxville filming?

2028
01:55:30,850 --> 01:55:33,320
It's done and everyone would be
like, oh, oh yeah, of course.

2029
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:37,880
Why doesn't that happen before? What is
it about dudes who want that feeling,

2030
01:55:37,881 --> 01:55:42,230
that rush of getting right up to the edge
because those guys get right up to the

2031
01:55:42,231 --> 01:55:46,080
edge. But Steve Steevo
backed off a lot. Right?

2032
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:47,250
Got Off the drugs.

2033
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:50,020
Yeah. He's a boy. He's completely
sober, which is awesome.

2034
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:54,470
[inaudible] now I talked to him
like six months ago, you know, like,

2035
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:58,480
so I'm in San Diego and he
had a sex addiction that he
was trying to get off of.

2036
01:55:58,540 --> 01:56:01,450
And then uh, then we're
throwing them under the bus. No,

2037
01:56:01,451 --> 01:56:04,120
cause I think it talks
about it and then maybe,

2038
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:06,760
but then like this last time I saw him,
like just a month ago,

2039
01:56:06,761 --> 01:56:09,280
I went down and again to see him and uh,
he uh,

2040
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:13,100
he had a guy that came with him to make
sure he did [inaudible] sex addictions.

2041
01:56:13,130 --> 01:56:17,650
That's hilarious. I was a joke. I'm
going to tell you something right now.

2042
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:18,761
A guy like,

2043
01:56:18,761 --> 01:56:22,450
he was supposed to have a sex addiction
block for the best because if you,

2044
01:56:22,451 --> 01:56:27,250
the amount of, that's his job. I'm a cock
block. Go. My name is Johnny, Johnny.

2045
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:32,260
Johnny. When Tom's a cock blocker,
you got a sex addiction. Don't worry,

2046
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:33,820
I'll get it.
I'll go with three pronged effort.

2047
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:35,470
Are going to mention your
daughter in front of them.

2048
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:41,290
I'm going to talk about your treatment
and leave it blank and then treatments a

2049
01:56:41,291 --> 01:56:42,880
big one and then I'm going to fuck her.

2050
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:50,320
Well a guy like that, like he probably,
I mean he's a famous dude, Steve Olds,

2051
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:50,871
famous dude.

2052
01:56:50,871 --> 01:56:54,650
So I bet some really hot chicks
launched themselves in his direction.

2053
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:57,500
He's pretty God damn famous. Yeah.
And he's famous for being a wild man.

2054
01:56:57,650 --> 01:57:01,250
So really crazy bitch is probably
tracked it to him like a magnet to metal

2055
01:57:01,251 --> 01:57:06,080
shavings. Let's start moving across
the desk at him. It's probably normal.

2056
01:57:06,110 --> 01:57:07,970
Right?
So for a guy like that,

2057
01:57:07,971 --> 01:57:12,380
the amount of love and sex he must be
getting or thrown his direction offered.

2058
01:57:12,381 --> 01:57:15,920
Damn. It must be pretty stunning. Let's
be high. And he's probably, you know,

2059
01:57:15,921 --> 01:57:17,240
it looks in the mirror,
he knows what he looks like.

2060
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:23,620
I may as well cash enough to take
myself up on this opportunity. You know,

2061
01:57:23,780 --> 01:57:27,740
it's wood. What you, no one
else gets that shot. No one.

2062
01:57:27,950 --> 01:57:31,250
Only one guy gets to be steevo. Yeah.
You know, I said that to you once.

2063
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:34,200
I remember that because it, it
struck with me too, as I said it,

2064
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:37,400
we were talking about comedy and
we're talking about creating like when

2065
01:57:37,401 --> 01:57:40,610
someone's a fan of yours. The craziest
thing is like if someone's an artist,

2066
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:43,910
your fear fan, you're the only
one that give them Ari Shaffir,

2067
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:45,470
they'd be coming to Arusha for your fan.

2068
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:47,790
You're the only one who's doing an
arch for your comedy. Yeah, that's it.

2069
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:51,830
You're responsible. You're
responsible for that shit. Yeah.

2070
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:56,750
So I'm sure he feels the
same way. Yup. Probably. Wow.

2071
01:57:57,380 --> 01:57:59,690
Yeah. It was like Steve
Over, I'll let me cash in.

2072
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:02,660
Cash is girls at ultimate
fan of Steve Bows.

2073
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:05,260
Why would he not nonsense.

2074
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:08,390
Do you mean he has sex a lot and it's
awesome because that's what you're saying.

2075
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:12,410
A lot of times I feel all
alone of Christian person
going and you shouldn't do

2076
01:58:12,411 --> 01:58:15,680
that too much, but of course
there are sex additions of course,

2077
01:58:15,681 --> 01:58:17,690
but there's everything addictions,
right?

2078
01:58:17,870 --> 01:58:20,000
I mean there's addictions to
fucking washing your hands.

2079
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:23,480
It's like you can't carry on with his
day so they can't get anything done.

2080
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:24,860
Then it's like,
I guess that's an addiction,

2081
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:27,890
but isn't it parallel to
what we were talking about
earlier about the cigarettes?

2082
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:31,010
That becomes like force of habit,
right? It becomes part of your life.

2083
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:35,210
It comes like a, uh, a well
worn trail in your mind.

2084
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:37,400
I like sex a lot,
but then if I've got work to do,

2085
01:58:37,401 --> 01:58:38,960
if there's something I have to do,
I'm like I can't,

2086
01:58:39,230 --> 01:58:41,860
I gotta like I gotta take care of
this. So you're not sick, right?

2087
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:45,740
You don't have the,
the sickness if you,

2088
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:51,010
some people like to call it no. Will.
Some people like to call it no discipline,

2089
01:58:51,011 --> 01:58:54,640
not me. I prefer illness. Disease.

2090
01:58:54,641 --> 01:58:56,740
I want to take it completely
out of your control.

2091
01:58:56,920 --> 01:59:01,090
Did we crash the also we offer
Ustream right now? No, no, no, no, no.

2092
01:59:01,091 --> 01:59:05,480
I mean the youtube crashed, crashed,
but we're still on Ustream stream.

2093
01:59:05,870 --> 01:59:08,200
So we're still at a youtube video
of this show. You by the way,

2094
01:59:08,201 --> 01:59:10,510
that you could probably play,
I guess the sex addiction thing,

2095
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:11,420
when it becomes a problem,

2096
01:59:11,421 --> 01:59:14,530
it's when he starts spending money and
we start being sloppy and having sex with

2097
01:59:14,531 --> 01:59:15,101
no condoms.

2098
01:59:15,101 --> 01:59:18,590
With people in the streets when you're
doing really liked doing the want to do

2099
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:22,160
or you really like doing that and
it's way better than not doing that.

2100
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,150
I'm not this.
One of the things that I don't buy.

2101
01:59:25,330 --> 01:59:27,280
I think it's when you look at
yourself later and go, fuck,

2102
01:59:27,281 --> 01:59:29,200
I don't want to do that.
Why can't I stop doing that?

2103
01:59:29,201 --> 01:59:32,080
And that's everything that's beating off.
That's using Q tips,

2104
01:59:32,081 --> 01:59:36,760
that's fucking biting your fingernails.
People get weird. People are weird.

2105
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:39,770
We're weird. I saw this guy, somebody was
talking about losing a bunch of weight,

2106
01:59:39,771 --> 01:59:43,150
some comic at a barbecue and this
other fatter comic and he was like,

2107
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:46,510
they were talking about eating natural
chips and stuff instead of like processed

2108
01:59:46,511 --> 01:59:48,660
stuff. And the federal
guys was like, man, Louis,

2109
01:59:48,670 --> 01:59:51,370
you gotta show me how to lose weight
as he's like eating the chips. He goes,

2110
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:55,420
well I just told you, but
still eat those things. Yo,

2111
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:58,290
you got to rewire my brain
and make it awesome. Yeah,

2112
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:01,630
I got to do it all the way for him
in his lazy ass bitch ass brain.

2113
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:07,030
That's a problem, man. If people don't get
their brains rewired in some way, shape,

2114
02:00:07,031 --> 02:00:11,320
or form. If you're a lazy fuck, it's very
difficult to wake up one day and go, oh,

2115
02:00:11,321 --> 02:00:15,020
I'm not going to be a lazy fuck.
Yeah. So if you don't get, yeah,

2116
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:18,610
if you don't get early going, I have
lazy tendencies. Yeah, we all do.

2117
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:21,860
And it's one of the reasons why I'm not
lazy at all cause I'm terrible should

2118
02:00:21,870 --> 02:00:25,090
against it. I don't like it. I liked
that part of me. I don't have cable.

2119
02:00:25,660 --> 02:00:29,380
I know I could watch TV all day. I
couldn't move. I'm never getting rid of.

2120
02:00:29,381 --> 02:00:34,300
Mine can really like coming on
right to internet. I like if I work,

2121
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:37,420
especially if I could do a show,
show goes well, everything's great.

2122
02:00:37,421 --> 02:00:40,180
I listened to set on the way home.
I know the new bits I'm working on.

2123
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:42,760
I don't have a responsibility as far as
writing and I don't like to write too

2124
02:00:42,761 --> 02:00:45,320
late at night when I'm, and then you
watch cable and you get home. Yeah,

2125
02:00:45,450 --> 02:00:48,790
I write late at night,
but only if I am home.

2126
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,970
I don't go out and then come back and
write cause I feel like I'm tired.

2127
02:00:52,090 --> 02:00:56,590
So I like to relax in front of the TV.
All download TV.

2128
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:58,780
I just won't have cable so
I can have it all the time.

2129
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:03,150
I'll still watch the shows. I watch, get
everything now on Apple TV, Hulu, Netflix.

2130
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:06,910
But then when it's done, you
don't automatically like,
oh this next show started.

2131
02:01:06,911 --> 02:01:08,920
I guess I'm watching
this now to get cosmos.

2132
02:01:09,150 --> 02:01:10,580
Can you get like all the regular shows?

2133
02:01:11,110 --> 02:01:14,200
The good rule of thumb is you can
get anything that's ever been made.

2134
02:01:14,810 --> 02:01:17,620
So if it's in that group,
you could pretty much get it.

2135
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:20,500
So you don't need a TV anymore
that's hooked up to cable.

2136
02:01:20,501 --> 02:01:22,870
You just need good Internet connection.
Any new server,

2137
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:26,170
only bad thing that you were
running into is live. Love.

2138
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:28,900
He v which now find the problem.

2139
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:31,210
Go to a bar and see that that's
the way to be seen. For sure.

2140
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:33,340
Sports that EU is fucking garbage.

2141
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:37,210
It's skips constantly and
cuts out today and Pasa Dena,

2142
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:41,600
a young man came home to find
another man sleeping in his bed.

2143
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:46,130
That fucking type of talk, that news type
guy, how does that, they have to die,

2144
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:49,850
not die like as in physically
but die off that business,

2145
02:01:50,190 --> 02:01:51,830
that fucking news business

2146
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:55,600
now with like chrome cast
though and an apple TV,

2147
02:01:55,601 --> 02:02:00,580
you can just stream from your phone
like you know like nbc.com so you could

2148
02:02:00,581 --> 02:02:04,570
watch the local news stream to your apple
TV anyway, so it doesn't, the problem

2149
02:02:04,690 --> 02:02:07,840
is there any bigger dinosaur in our
culture? Then the local news show,

2150
02:02:08,890 --> 02:02:11,590
is there any bigger dinosaurs on
the five o'clock news sitcoms,

2151
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:15,310
President Obama met with Egypt.
You're not going to say shit.

2152
02:02:15,370 --> 02:02:17,990
You're not going to say the same
shit. We all know. You know,

2153
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:20,650
we don't all know you're in.
You're in with the government.

2154
02:02:20,651 --> 02:02:23,770
You're not going to say shit. On top
of that, you've got three minutes,

2155
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:26,830
you got three minutes, you get a
bounce around to five different things.

2156
02:02:26,860 --> 02:02:28,230
You know what somebody
pointed out was so scary,

2157
02:02:28,231 --> 02:02:30,890
but the company to help Bush was like,
I can't let you show the, uh, the,

2158
02:02:30,990 --> 02:02:34,540
the caskets coming back. Yeah,
I met Obama was like, okay guys,

2159
02:02:34,541 --> 02:02:36,550
we're going to stop that. You're,
you're allowed to show them.

2160
02:02:36,610 --> 02:02:40,660
And now they just don't
show them out of just fear.

2161
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:43,720
So the news just doesn't show them.
They just don't on their own.

2162
02:02:44,310 --> 02:02:46,300
So whatever was told to them,
it was like,

2163
02:02:46,780 --> 02:02:48,880
what do you think about all the
shit that's going on in Iraq?

2164
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:50,890
Do you know what's happening in Iraq?

2165
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:55,110
Jihadists are taking over Iraq as
soon as we left. How crazy is that?

2166
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:59,170
It was a vacuum that we made.
It's not our fights, man.

2167
02:02:59,590 --> 02:03:02,500
I know it's not our fights, but
what a disaster. A disaster.

2168
02:03:02,501 --> 02:03:05,980
We did nothing to help them.
What could you do to stay there forever?

2169
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:08,530
We're running shit now. And that's
not what you want to be. That's it.

2170
02:03:08,531 --> 02:03:11,790
Then you're an occupying force. That's
the move. Nobody wants to know. No.

2171
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:16,070
It's obviously the move.
You can't let the geodes tangle.

2172
02:03:16,570 --> 02:03:19,360
You want to jihad is state run by geodes.
What about the children?

2173
02:03:20,050 --> 02:03:21,670
I'll tell you one thing,
please do.

2174
02:03:22,210 --> 02:03:23,680
So they had this thing that
we're going to do in China.

2175
02:03:23,681 --> 02:03:26,170
They're going to put chips in every one
of the computers so that you couldn't go

2176
02:03:26,171 --> 02:03:29,680
on Vpn so you couldn't go on
the stuff they didn't allow. Um,

2177
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:32,950
and the people got really mad about it.
They were like, that's fucking ridiculous.

2178
02:03:32,951 --> 02:03:34,600
And they got like start,
they wrote down,

2179
02:03:35,130 --> 02:03:39,300
they didn't apprise but they were all
upset and the government was like, oh no,

2180
02:03:39,310 --> 02:03:42,610
I won't do it.
Well they were worried whereas here,

2181
02:03:43,330 --> 02:03:47,800
that's just something we were going to
do and not tell anyone until Snowden told

2182
02:03:47,801 --> 02:03:50,830
us. But that's just something we were,
they at least ran it by their people.

2183
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:55,090
We were just going to do it in secrecy.
Forced the companies to do exactly that.

2184
02:03:55,150 --> 02:03:57,910
Yeah. Interesting. When that
happens. Yeah. Did you see that?

2185
02:03:57,911 --> 02:04:02,410
So we can talk about like ultimate
freedoms. It's like, Eh, I don't know.

2186
02:04:02,740 --> 02:04:03,910
I don't know which one's worse.

2187
02:04:04,380 --> 02:04:05,650
Are you,
what do you get really freaked out?

2188
02:04:05,651 --> 02:04:08,830
I just found this out by PDC or you know,
you remember PD,

2189
02:04:08,831 --> 02:04:10,920
if you go into your security on your,

2190
02:04:11,070 --> 02:04:16,070
your privacy on your phone and then
you go down to a location services,

2191
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:18,490
you click on location services,

2192
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:23,940
then you go all the way down to a
system services and then you go down to

2193
02:04:25,151 --> 02:04:28,060
frequent locations.
Then we'll just say like,

2194
02:04:28,180 --> 02:04:32,800
it'll show your history and uh, let's
just say, uh, we'll click on Los Angeles,

2195
02:04:32,801 --> 02:04:37,801
nine locations recorded and it's just
showing locations that I've been like the

2196
02:04:37,891 --> 02:04:41,100
last nine days.
The exact address I've been in.

2197
02:04:41,101 --> 02:04:46,101
Where you're driving around the hung
out at like I went to New York four

2198
02:04:46,501 --> 02:04:50,110
locations. Is it places where
you stopped and made a call? No,

2199
02:04:50,130 --> 02:04:52,950
where I stopped and it just shows
that I wasn't driving anymore.

2200
02:04:52,951 --> 02:04:55,500
That got hung out.
Shows exact dots on a map of New York.

2201
02:04:57,180 --> 02:05:01,740
It's like the map of the exact
addresses of places I've been.

2202
02:05:01,741 --> 02:05:03,060
And how do people not know about this?

2203
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:05,940
I've just finding out about it on
the Joe Rogan experience podcast.

2204
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:08,070
Can you shut that off? Can you
shut it off? You can turn it off.

2205
02:05:08,071 --> 02:05:11,500
And now what apple is saying that that,
that you use it for is,

2206
02:05:11,501 --> 02:05:15,440
is that it will automatically
become smart. Your phones,

2207
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:20,040
your maps are smart,
smart knows you're running from the law.

2208
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:23,460
Yeah. Right. And that's why like
if you, if you use like, uh,

2209
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:26,820
like different things like Google
home where it says like, Oh, you know,

2210
02:05:26,821 --> 02:05:31,020
your trip to Pasadena Ice House right
now it's 20 minutes. And I'm like,

2211
02:05:31,021 --> 02:05:33,570
why are you telling me this? Like have
you seen that? Yeah, I got it. It's done.

2212
02:05:33,571 --> 02:05:34,980
Shit like that.
It's the same thing.

2213
02:05:34,981 --> 02:05:37,620
It's just to improve maps
and things like that.

2214
02:05:37,660 --> 02:05:39,630
So that's why you can
tell you can turn it off.

2215
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:43,190
The government gets a hold of it and
finds out the warehouse where you're

2216
02:05:43,191 --> 02:05:47,730
storing the drugs. Right, right. Is that
crazy, Ari or storing the draw? Yeah,

2217
02:05:47,731 --> 02:05:49,800
exactly. Well, if you're storing
you going to the drug house,

2218
02:05:50,010 --> 02:05:53,380
don't bring your phone. Don't bring
her exactly at a burner phone. Well,

2219
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:55,320
he's stopped here four times.
Let's go check that out.

2220
02:05:55,350 --> 02:05:57,780
Get one of them flip phones from tank.
Yeah, that's a good point. Right?

2221
02:05:57,781 --> 02:05:58,950
Here's all those jellyfish check.

2222
02:05:58,990 --> 02:06:02,880
I'm going to look at there on the
beach right here. This is a Steevo,

2223
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:04,770
but where am I going?

2224
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:06,670
Hi. Went around here. That's
what we'll never do that.

2225
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:10,390
He's got to put a sub

2226
02:06:12,650 --> 02:06:17,430
and here's my business
and business is good.

2227
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:20,390
Can you just tell me so many?
Oh,

2228
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:24,153
so he's,

2229
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:31,180
he's gonna throw the Jellyfish Times head.

2230
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:37,150
Do you think that just feels right?

2231
02:06:37,190 --> 02:06:39,260
Weird hurts.
I don't know because it hurting.

2232
02:06:40,220 --> 02:06:44,000
I think it probably just feels, it looks
like it just feels weird. Oh my God.

2233
02:06:44,001 --> 02:06:45,110
Look at the size of that thing.

2234
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:54,030
Oh, he hit him with a ton of gold. Oh
Damn. Oh, he's in pain, right? He's,

2235
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,680
he's so crazy.
He's sitting on his back.

2236
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:08,970
Amazing Agony. Screaming
and running. Oh my God.

2237
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:13,460
And anthem background.

2238
02:07:13,820 --> 02:07:18,020
Oh my God. He's just running around
in agony. What does it say afterwards?

2239
02:07:18,170 --> 02:07:20,210
Nothing sucks out of my chair.

2240
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:25,390
So she scribed here and if you haven't
seen my incredible pop Errante prego

2241
02:07:26,961 --> 02:07:31,820
killed with Paris. Tell
that Jesus Christ loved you.

2242
02:07:31,821 --> 02:07:35,290
And then I hated y'all in one
video. Youtube. Steven. Wow.

2243
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:39,520
What a crazy guy. Jelly fish.
Well, he's a better man than I.

2244
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:43,720
Yeah, it's not happening. He's
just always wanting to go for it.

2245
02:07:43,721 --> 02:07:48,640
The grossness and the snort. It was Sabi.
Yeah. Fuck all that, man. Scott crazy.

2246
02:07:50,050 --> 02:07:53,410
I just can't imagine. I can't imagine
someone would actually want to do that.

2247
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:58,880
That seems like a fucking terrible idea,
but we watched it so he wins. Right?

2248
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:03,580
He wins. That's what his objective is
achieved. Yeah, exactly. It was cool.

2249
02:08:03,581 --> 02:08:04,570
It's worth watching,
by the way.

2250
02:08:04,571 --> 02:08:08,230
My storytellers show is recording
September 9th oh, ain't shit.

2251
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:12,170
I started working on that
story. Yeah. Yeah. Nice.

2252
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:15,870
I got that bitch tightened up
now. Cool. So far it's you Diaz,

2253
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:20,890
big j crushers in Nice TJ millers in
there trying to get Joan Rivers to do it.

2254
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:25,780
Oh, snap. Yeah, that'd be cool.
That'd be very cool. Yeah.

2255
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:30,100
That's interesting. Yeah. The corner
after a few cool people too. Yeah,

2256
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:34,860
so I'm doing your show man. That, that,
that was really fun. Yeah. You liked it.

2257
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:37,810
Loved it. I loved the set
up that it was in cheetahs,

2258
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:41,620
which is like a dingy strip club because
going into it, that's what we did.

2259
02:08:41,621 --> 02:08:43,830
It in Montreal the first time we're
doing it again this year actually much at

2260
02:08:43,831 --> 02:08:47,110
all, but it's up stairs in
this, the trainee Strip club,
so you walk up the stairs,

2261
02:08:47,111 --> 02:08:51,400
you just feel like darker and then no
matter what's said, it's like, go for it.

2262
02:08:51,401 --> 02:08:54,010
I'm already been anesthetized
against this trainee ship.

2263
02:08:54,090 --> 02:08:57,010
You're not allowed to say
training anymore, by the
way. I transgender what? Yup.

2264
02:08:57,310 --> 02:09:00,910
Yup. It's like saying fag. Oh really? Yep.

2265
02:09:01,330 --> 02:09:05,290
But you could still call cabbies cabbies.
They're going to get upset now.

2266
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:09,070
They're okay for now, so we've got to
use it up while we can in the future.

2267
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:11,830
It'll be one of those things where
it's like, you know, like Tom Sorey,

2268
02:09:11,831 --> 02:09:16,720
they don't say like it was,
it was a Jew in the word nigger.

2269
02:09:16,721 --> 02:09:19,370
They took it out of Tom Sawyer. They
took it out of huckleberry out. That's,

2270
02:09:19,410 --> 02:09:21,820
I was just thinking about that. That's
the problem with people going well that,

2271
02:09:21,850 --> 02:09:24,340
well that certainly certain
lines that you shouldn't,

2272
02:09:24,341 --> 02:09:25,570
people shouldn't listen
to it. I'm like, no,

2273
02:09:25,571 --> 02:09:27,190
you just shouldn't listen
to it and just turn it off.

2274
02:09:27,550 --> 02:09:31,330
Otherwise you're like the
exact same people that took
out that edited huck Finn.

2275
02:09:31,410 --> 02:09:33,580
Yeah. It said, no, we can't
have that book in there.

2276
02:09:33,670 --> 02:09:36,100
You can edit that out so you
can't write what you write,

2277
02:09:36,101 --> 02:09:38,290
but I'm allowed to go to the school board
and tried to get him to take it out of

2278
02:09:38,291 --> 02:09:39,124
the libraries.

2279
02:09:39,340 --> 02:09:41,740
That's what you're doing when you
contacted the network and saying,

2280
02:09:41,741 --> 02:09:43,090
we want this band.
Yeah.

2281
02:09:43,091 --> 02:09:47,990
You have to reflect a time in an
accurate way because it's not about you.

2282
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,430
You're pretending to people
haven't evolved socially
since the 1920s or whatever

2283
02:09:51,431 --> 02:09:55,200
the fuck they made. 18
something did he made. Yeah.

2284
02:09:55,420 --> 02:09:56,970
That's part of being a human beings.

2285
02:09:57,020 --> 02:09:59,440
Understanding that there's
a constant series of

2286
02:10:00,970 --> 02:10:04,180
changes and things people grow.
Cultures evolve.

2287
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:07,240
We're seeing in in front of our own
fucking eyes because the internet,

2288
02:10:07,570 --> 02:10:08,650
we're seeing blowback.

2289
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:11,650
We're seeing people get super sensitive
about shit they shouldn't get so

2290
02:10:11,651 --> 02:10:13,030
sensitive about and they just,

2291
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:15,850
other folks embrace it just because they
want to be in and out of fight and pick

2292
02:10:15,851 --> 02:10:18,520
a side and you know and
look for like really suit,

2293
02:10:18,521 --> 02:10:23,140
like the fat acceptance movement. Do
you know that, oh, I'll fight that. No,

2294
02:10:23,141 --> 02:10:24,070
you're going to die.

2295
02:10:24,300 --> 02:10:27,940
I'm not going to accept that you're going
to die early and it's disgusting and

2296
02:10:27,941 --> 02:10:30,310
you smell, Dude. You're so Adeline.

2297
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:33,980
One of those will stop stopped being like

2298
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:38,730
that. What about what bad except
dance? No, I do not accept it now.

2299
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:40,660
Now you're so angry.

2300
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:43,550
Not even in a my day think it's
gross and you're going to die.

2301
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:46,670
It's clearly unhealthy.
Dumped, stopping, gross,

2302
02:10:46,671 --> 02:10:50,930
but isn't that another thing just like
a sex addiction or a gambling addiction?

2303
02:10:50,931 --> 02:10:52,790
It's a food addiction.
No,

2304
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:56,360
I don't care what anybody says
about fridges in the eyes of others.

2305
02:10:56,780 --> 02:10:58,160
It does a little bit sometimes on a plane,

2306
02:10:58,900 --> 02:11:03,140
but when anybody says about the causes,
the causes of it,

2307
02:11:03,470 --> 02:11:06,860
for sure. Some people have a
faster metabolism for sure.

2308
02:11:06,861 --> 02:11:09,480
Some shirt and get away with
eating anything. We all know dudes.

2309
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:11,960
I could just eat anything and they never
get fat. I'm closer to one of those.

2310
02:11:12,010 --> 02:11:16,640
Yeah, but we also know that if they stay,
but your stomach, what are they doing?

2311
02:11:17,030 --> 02:11:20,630
They're making your stomach smaller. That
means you take in less food. It's it.

2312
02:11:20,631 --> 02:11:24,530
So it's a willpower thing. So you're just
taking less. You need less to fill up.

2313
02:11:24,710 --> 02:11:28,480
This mother fucker did it. He
lost 80 pounds, Brian. Yeah,

2314
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:33,170
Brian lost 80 pounds once I'm back
most of it. But he lost 80 pounds.

2315
02:11:33,171 --> 02:11:36,720
Same thing with Joey is Joey
Dee has lost 80 pounds. Yeah,

2316
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:42,380
he gained back 67
somewhere. I Dunno. I Dunno.

2317
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:47,150
But, but the idea is that if you
could just get it off, keep it off.

2318
02:11:47,151 --> 02:11:48,860
Some guys have got it,
got it off and keep it.

2319
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:51,900
I mean I guess there is such a
thing as a, as, as an addition,

2320
02:11:51,901 --> 02:11:55,790
but I think it's way more
people just going like, well
I'm in that group. Like, no,

2321
02:11:55,791 --> 02:11:59,480
you ain't heard you just stopped going
to the diner at three 45 it's also,

2322
02:11:59,481 --> 02:12:02,300
they get addicted to having certain
types of foods in their body,

2323
02:12:02,301 --> 02:12:06,330
like sugars that, you know, like there's
a lot of people you get used to it.

2324
02:12:07,890 --> 02:12:10,550
If I, if I have enough days
in a row of lots of candy,

2325
02:12:10,551 --> 02:12:14,150
which is every day and then if I go a
day without it by 6:00 PM I start getting

2326
02:12:14,151 --> 02:12:19,000
like low blood sugar. Yeah, he got
to stop beating cancer. I know. Yeah.

2327
02:12:19,010 --> 02:12:22,190
I'm trying to get off.
I was doing a lot less of that in China.

2328
02:12:23,210 --> 02:12:26,270
You don't take caffeine in? No.
No Caffeine. It's hilarious. Yeah.

2329
02:12:26,410 --> 02:12:28,790
Translate and sugar.
I can see the negative effect on me,

2330
02:12:28,820 --> 02:12:31,670
but caffeine has benefits,
antioxidant effects,

2331
02:12:31,730 --> 02:12:35,540
cognitive benefits does they
show up? That's good. Yeah.

2332
02:12:35,750 --> 02:12:38,600
That's probably better because you
get some caffeine from the tee,

2333
02:12:38,601 --> 02:12:43,430
but he is like drinking like a
very mild vegetable soup. Really?

2334
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:44,510
Yeah,
the lights lights too though.

2335
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:48,890
There's like some certain
type of vegetable nutrients
that you can get, you know,

2336
02:12:48,891 --> 02:12:51,830
not a lot of it very watered down,
but it's actually not bad for you.

2337
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:54,350
Like a lot of teas are
actually quite good for you.

2338
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:57,260
They say even the caffeine sees is
really the caffeine stays in the leaf,

2339
02:12:57,290 --> 02:12:59,240
so it's not really coming
off it into your stuff.

2340
02:12:59,580 --> 02:13:04,280
But I never had got jacked from tea. I
never had drank tea and I was like, whoa.

2341
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:06,770
Once I started losing my voice,
I just did a little research like,

2342
02:13:06,771 --> 02:13:08,660
what makes you lose your voice?
And one of them was,

2343
02:13:09,620 --> 02:13:12,800
one of them was caffeine and I was
like, I'm done. I've never heard that.

2344
02:13:13,230 --> 02:13:16,680
Never heard Caffeine dehydrates
you in some way. It's caffeine.

2345
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:19,460
They definitely said alcohol. They said
smoking, but I'm like, look, I'll make,

2346
02:13:19,550 --> 02:13:23,900
I'll make do where I can fully
used to drink pots of coffee.

2347
02:13:23,990 --> 02:13:28,040
Really hot pots.
You said he pretty much ran that show.

2348
02:13:28,070 --> 02:13:32,010
Start to stop to top to bottom.
Dave Foley didn't pretty much won the

2349
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:34,170
show.
Paul Simms definitely ran the show.

2350
02:13:34,171 --> 02:13:35,600
He was the guy who
produced it and created it.

2351
02:13:35,610 --> 02:13:38,930
But Dave Foley was what I would
call like a secret producer,

2352
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:41,790
an uncredited producer. He
just took control of it. Well,

2353
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:45,300
he was just really good at creating
sketches because of kids in the hall.

2354
02:13:45,310 --> 02:13:48,450
So good. Really good. I saw
them live somewhere. Oh yeah,

2355
02:13:48,451 --> 02:13:53,070
you're telling me he was really good at
creating moments and so Dave would see

2356
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:53,911
like a scene.

2357
02:13:53,911 --> 02:13:58,290
And the reason why he was
able to do that was that Paul,

2358
02:13:58,650 --> 02:14:01,140
like he saw that that
was a benefit they had.

2359
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:04,200
They had super healthy egos about
that stuff. Like they would let us,

2360
02:14:04,530 --> 02:14:07,470
we could ad Lib all the time.
Especially for the first four years.

2361
02:14:07,471 --> 02:14:11,340
We did a lot of ad libbing and
Dave Foley was a big part of that,

2362
02:14:11,341 --> 02:14:14,580
like restructuring entire scenes the
first four years at the meeting before,

2363
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:19,440
before Phil died. Yeah. Yeah.
But um, uh, Dave, you know,

2364
02:14:19,441 --> 02:14:23,010
he just had a great sense of it and
it was just a really open sort of an

2365
02:14:23,011 --> 02:14:26,340
environment where they allowed
like Andy Dick, you know,

2366
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,260
they allowed him to be him.

2367
02:14:28,261 --> 02:14:32,790
Like they allowed him to open up
and expand and expand the character.

2368
02:14:32,820 --> 02:14:33,980
Like he would have these,

2369
02:14:34,130 --> 02:14:37,560
these moments and he would add a bunch
of things to the moment to make the more

2370
02:14:37,561 --> 02:14:40,410
ridiculous and preposterous and
we would add things to each other.

2371
02:14:40,411 --> 02:14:42,960
Like I would write like
occasionally write for Vicky Lewis.

2372
02:14:42,961 --> 02:14:45,840
Like I could see how she would
make something really funny.

2373
02:14:46,110 --> 02:14:48,120
And so like we would like,
we would do it for each other.

2374
02:14:48,121 --> 02:14:50,740
Like she might suggest
something to me and like she,

2375
02:14:50,741 --> 02:14:53,910
she would see like your character
from an outside point of view.

2376
02:14:53,980 --> 02:14:57,290
I say something like that. Yeah.
That would work well. That was a,

2377
02:14:57,420 --> 02:15:00,930
it was a weird environment and robbery,
Huh? Yeah, it was a great camaraderie.

2378
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:04,640
There was a, it was a great cab. That
was a really good show man and Sims,

2379
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:08,740
great show. There was like a
straight actors too, like uh,

2380
02:15:08,810 --> 02:15:11,190
like Steve Rowe who's
whole fucking hilarious.

2381
02:15:11,191 --> 02:15:15,720
But he essentially would just take the
lines and go into his character and then,

2382
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:20,760
you know, like creative office space
and like, you forget about him.

2383
02:15:21,130 --> 02:15:25,720
He's doing great. He's great. He's just
fucking great guy. Take a serious tool.

2384
02:15:26,250 --> 02:15:29,190
He gave $1 million, some charity. You're
like, how good are they doing his career?

2385
02:15:29,191 --> 02:15:33,440
He him $1 million to some charity.
Did it really? Wow. So it runs the,

2386
02:15:33,441 --> 02:15:36,300
she said not as easy. You might've
made that up. Might have been $20

2387
02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:40,410
I could see him doing that though.
He's such a nice guy.

2388
02:15:41,030 --> 02:15:44,220
He really had a lot of money
laying around. I might do
it suddenly cared about.

2389
02:15:44,310 --> 02:15:47,190
He's a,
he's a very interesting real artists.

2390
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:48,660
Like that's how I described Steven route.

2391
02:15:48,661 --> 02:15:50,760
Like when it comes to like being an actor,
he's a real artist.

2392
02:15:50,761 --> 02:15:53,070
He was some of the money too at some of
them are into it like that where it's

2393
02:15:53,071 --> 02:15:55,000
like he was legit.
You're add something.

2394
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:59,100
Plus you couldn't say anything bad about
the guy as a person. Very nice person.

2395
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:03,350
Always a very nice person. But the
most impressive actress was a actor.

2396
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:06,660
It was more attorney. Well I didn't
even know she was acting sometimes.

2397
02:16:06,661 --> 02:16:07,710
Like we'd be doing a scene together.

2398
02:16:07,711 --> 02:16:09,600
Like sometimes we'd fuck
off in the middle of scenes.

2399
02:16:09,660 --> 02:16:12,540
People joke around and she would get
back into the scene and she was, it was,

2400
02:16:12,541 --> 02:16:15,880
she was so good. Like you couldn't tell
that she was acting sometimes. Does that,

2401
02:16:15,930 --> 02:16:20,070
if that makes any sense. Yeah.
Like her ability to act. You know,

2402
02:16:20,071 --> 02:16:22,350
I didn't really never
even took acting classes.

2403
02:16:22,351 --> 02:16:26,340
I took a couple lessons and private
lessons that Disney made me take with this

2404
02:16:26,341 --> 02:16:31,341
really crazy lady who was trying to
get me to her to be my mom in a sitcom.

2405
02:16:32,161 --> 02:16:35,570
They created a sitcoms. Oh she
was so crazy. And I did it for,

2406
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:37,660
because they made me do it.
I took these acting classes.

2407
02:16:37,670 --> 02:16:41,470
Try to get you to put her in it. Yeah.
It was humiliating to, it's like she was,

2408
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:45,160
it was uncomfortable.
It was such an uncomfortable scenario.

2409
02:16:45,300 --> 02:16:48,960
Like they hired her to do it,
but she was like really a weird with,

2410
02:16:49,630 --> 02:16:51,460
well she said weird shit to me too.
She's like,

2411
02:16:51,490 --> 02:16:53,410
I'm worried you're going to go over
there and you're going to fail.

2412
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:55,840
Oh she said that's I put putting my head.
Yeah.

2413
02:16:55,841 --> 02:16:58,120
But I'm not good at that
shit and you know, because I,

2414
02:16:58,121 --> 02:17:01,660
I people played head games with me
all throughout my childhood in fights.

2415
02:17:01,990 --> 02:17:06,130
Like that would be at the way people would
say weird head games shit to you when

2416
02:17:06,131 --> 02:17:08,860
you were weighing in. Like what's going
to be like when I knock you out? Oh,

2417
02:17:08,861 --> 02:17:11,890
that's not going to happen, so don't worry
about it. Have a nice night. You know,

2418
02:17:12,250 --> 02:17:14,440
I'll see in a few minutes. Okay, and
I'm gonna kick you in your fucking face.

2419
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:16,300
I didn't say shit like that to each other.

2420
02:17:16,690 --> 02:17:21,100
So like when you knew that you were going
to have a fucking kickboxing match and

2421
02:17:21,101 --> 02:17:23,200
then you're talking shit to
somebody at the weigh ins,

2422
02:17:23,470 --> 02:17:27,370
the difference between that and some lady
who was an acting coach trying to tell

2423
02:17:27,371 --> 02:17:29,110
me that she thinks I'm
going to go over there.

2424
02:17:29,140 --> 02:17:31,090
I'm worried you're going to go over
there and you're going to fail. I'm like,

2425
02:17:31,091 --> 02:17:33,580
well, you don't need to worry about
that and don't talk to me like this.

2426
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:36,360
This is so gross. Passive
aggressive. Like, why?

2427
02:17:36,361 --> 02:17:38,470
Why are you worried that I'm going to
fail because I got something that you

2428
02:17:38,471 --> 02:17:42,100
never got the shut up.
This is a stupid way of talking to people.

2429
02:17:42,101 --> 02:17:44,200
You don't ever say, I'm worried you're
going to go over there and fail.

2430
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:45,710
What does that,
what does the God,

2431
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:50,080
I'm not the best actor in the world have
never been, but I know how to do it.

2432
02:17:50,170 --> 02:17:53,290
It's not that hard when
you're acting sick Tom Style,

2433
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:57,190
if you pretend that it's really broad.
Exactly. So when I'm doing that I'm like,

2434
02:17:57,580 --> 02:17:58,930
I know what I'm doing here.
Like

2435
02:18:00,730 --> 02:18:04,390
Jesus' command to the line.
Again, it's not that hard,

2436
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:08,230
but it was also good.
Writing is the most important thing.

2437
02:18:08,250 --> 02:18:10,480
Cause News radio had its harbor.
There's really your writing.

2438
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:13,120
It had perfect writing at many times.

2439
02:18:13,150 --> 02:18:17,650
It was like the best written shows for
by far the best written thing that I was

2440
02:18:17,651 --> 02:18:20,530
ever a part of,
but I wasn't a bad show before that.

2441
02:18:20,530 --> 02:18:22,990
There's Fox show was terrible.
Yeah,

2442
02:18:22,991 --> 02:18:25,480
the baseball show was
diggity diggity dog shit.

2443
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:30,160
It was so bad and so that's way harder
to do when you do a show like news radio,

2444
02:18:30,161 --> 02:18:34,690
it's easy to be good because the writing
so you can get into it more ideas. Good.

2445
02:18:34,691 --> 02:18:38,030
They let you, they let you say, I'm
going to change his lines a little bit.

2446
02:18:38,031 --> 02:18:42,400
So this sounds about some more like
to say if you let someone be involved,

2447
02:18:42,401 --> 02:18:45,250
I think this is where Paul Simms with
a genius and not just in the fact that

2448
02:18:45,251 --> 02:18:46,090
he's a really good writer,

2449
02:18:46,091 --> 02:18:50,560
but he also recognized that if you let
someone be a part of the creative process,

2450
02:18:50,561 --> 02:18:55,320
there are even more invested in it. They
enjoy it even. Oh yeah, that's right.

2451
02:18:55,390 --> 02:18:56,181
I mean,
I think that was it.

2452
02:18:56,181 --> 02:18:59,830
It was also that they were always
just no ego looking for the best line.

2453
02:19:00,220 --> 02:19:04,360
And Foley would always come up with the
best line. He was so good at that. It's,

2454
02:19:04,361 --> 02:19:06,780
you know, he's one of those
guys, man, you know, he's,

2455
02:19:06,850 --> 02:19:09,350
he's been on the podcast
before talking about his, uh,

2456
02:19:09,380 --> 02:19:13,090
the problems that he's had in divorce
and alimony and child support and stuff

2457
02:19:13,091 --> 02:19:17,710
like that. That. He's one of
those guys that like when I,

2458
02:19:17,740 --> 02:19:21,850
when I think about the fact that he might
have been like derailed and a lot of

2459
02:19:21,851 --> 02:19:26,500
ways because of this horrible relationship
that he is still tied up to and

2460
02:19:26,650 --> 02:19:31,650
financially with and still a part of some
crazy divorce proceedings going on and

2461
02:19:31,701 --> 02:19:34,840
on and on because he owes back alimony
or child support or whatever that can

2462
02:19:34,850 --> 02:19:38,180
worse relationship on that
show. The second worst. Yeah.

2463
02:19:38,181 --> 02:19:42,590
He had the second worst out, the worst.
That was the other thing you get used to.

2464
02:19:42,650 --> 02:19:46,160
You get used to seeing all these people
interact with other people of their ilk

2465
02:19:46,190 --> 02:19:50,480
and that's where I developed my no head
shots policy. Very important. Yeah.

2466
02:19:50,510 --> 02:19:51,343
Being around

2467
02:19:52,570 --> 02:19:56,300
actors interacting with other actors
and they're both crazy and they're both

2468
02:19:56,301 --> 02:19:59,720
trying to work it out and you know,
just, it was just too much chaos,

2469
02:19:59,780 --> 02:20:03,740
too much chaos there with famous people
trying to hang out with other wanting to

2470
02:20:03,741 --> 02:20:06,660
be famous people or other famous people.
It's very weird.

2471
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:08,300
There's also the weird dynamic,

2472
02:20:08,301 --> 02:20:12,390
if only one of you as
successful and you're both in
the same business, not good.

2473
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:16,490
Not Good.
I've had friends that were successful,

2474
02:20:16,491 --> 02:20:19,760
but they dated unsuccessful actresses
and the unsuccessful actresses was always

2475
02:20:19,761 --> 02:20:24,350
try to get them to mention
them to a casting director.
Did you say, did you say,

2476
02:20:24,351 --> 02:20:26,090
did you talk about me?
Because that movie,

2477
02:20:26,091 --> 02:20:28,700
he's casting that movie and I am
fucking perfect for that part.

2478
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,500
He doesn't know that I'm
perfect for that part.

2479
02:20:30,501 --> 02:20:34,540
But you have to tell him I've seen that
shit isn't no, because you're not. Yeah.

2480
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:35,473
Or the other way.

2481
02:20:35,690 --> 02:20:39,320
It's even crazier when it's a check and
the checks making mad money and on TV in

2482
02:20:39,321 --> 02:20:39,960
front of the camera.

2483
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:43,670
Do something with your life that Weasley
do this behind her sweaty holding our

2484
02:20:43,671 --> 02:20:47,930
hands. And what do you do, Tom? You
know, a producer of sorts? Well,

2485
02:20:47,980 --> 02:20:49,760
I'm working on the script right now.

2486
02:20:49,761 --> 02:20:54,761
It's kind of a romantic comedy
involving my wife and another man.

2487
02:20:55,200 --> 02:21:00,050
That's all I got. Yeah. Yeah.
W th the dominant female,

2488
02:21:00,350 --> 02:21:02,930
the dominant female
star with the Beta male,

2489
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:07,850
the Beta male behind her hanging in there,
clinging people tell you it's normal.

2490
02:21:07,851 --> 02:21:11,900
It's totally normal. It's totally
normal, bitch. I ain't normal.

2491
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:14,320
Not Normal.
It gets

2492
02:21:17,490 --> 02:21:21,650
so hard. People like the Yin and the
Yang of relationships. Very difficult.

2493
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:26,680
I've seen so many cool relationships
that at some point became deaf.

2494
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:30,560
No, they just, the girl turns and
they go, what are you doing? I mean,

2495
02:21:30,561 --> 02:21:33,800
you've got to get a better job. You've
got to do. It was like, well, why?

2496
02:21:33,801 --> 02:21:37,150
Because you're going have better
job. Yeah. Wow. Wow. I just,

2497
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:40,200
but it gets in the way that's, they're
like, that's their breeding. Well,

2498
02:21:40,201 --> 02:21:43,100
it's also you hanging around with comics.
Yeah, and it's about, it's like, yeah,

2499
02:21:43,160 --> 02:21:46,220
I'm going to struggle for a while.
Well, just a lot of comics that there,

2500
02:21:46,221 --> 02:21:49,250
they get married and the girl wants
to have a baby and then she worries.

2501
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:51,240
How are you going to be able
to feed the baby? I don't know.

2502
02:21:51,241 --> 02:21:53,180
Why did you get involved
with the fucking broke comic?

2503
02:21:53,181 --> 02:21:56,160
What'd you think he was going to
do? Suddenly be a banker. Okay.

2504
02:21:56,680 --> 02:21:58,850
Yeah. To help them. You Fall in love with

2505
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:03,970
love with and I fell in love with
you. Okay. I'm fucking tired.

2506
02:22:03,971 --> 02:22:08,920
I wish it didn't happen, but it did.
It's a spell. It's a magic spell.

2507
02:22:09,330 --> 02:22:12,670
Well, well, I fell in love with you.
It was your love for abortion. Oh No,

2508
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:15,810
things are tight. Goodness. How dare you.

2509
02:22:15,811 --> 02:22:20,220
That's a perfect thing to say right there.
How dare the, yeah. Have you talked to,

2510
02:22:20,221 --> 02:22:23,190
if you talk to someone that you're dating
them and you know this is never going

2511
02:22:23,191 --> 02:22:27,870
anywhere and they're like thoroughly
to abortion, you're like, yeah,

2512
02:22:28,190 --> 02:22:29,070
it does get an ugly.

2513
02:22:30,380 --> 02:22:33,450
That's good in the worst way because
unfortunately there are, you know,

2514
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:36,000
Patrice had a fucking
great joke about that.

2515
02:22:36,360 --> 02:22:39,900
Patrice had a great joke about
people getting mad that, you know,

2516
02:22:39,901 --> 02:22:42,900
you don't want to have the same kind of
relationship they have and it's like,

2517
02:22:44,210 --> 02:22:48,930
yeah, he goes, it's like if you are
applying for a position and you know,

That's the only position that's available.

2523
02:23:05,390 --> 02:23:07,790
They're going to leave and tell
me whether you want this position,

2524
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:10,860
like don't like that's
the kind of relationship,

2525
02:23:13,710 --> 02:23:16,500
that's the kind of relationship we have.
You know,

2526
02:23:16,501 --> 02:23:20,260
you can't get mad at me that I don't want
to make it something different. Yeah.

2527
02:23:20,730 --> 02:23:22,380
This is what I have open for you.

2528
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:24,510
I call this girl on some city that
I'd hooked up with here or there.

2529
02:23:24,511 --> 02:23:27,230
I met her at Brayer, one of your shows.
Actually I'm on my own brand. Yeah,

2530
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:31,270
real cool.
And uh,

2531
02:23:31,890 --> 02:23:35,400
we've done it on and on for a few years
and then I found her in some cities.

2532
02:23:35,401 --> 02:23:38,370
She was living there now and she was like,
actually I got a boyfriend now.

2533
02:23:38,890 --> 02:23:40,520
I was like, we should, you want to
hang out when, because you know,

2534
02:23:40,521 --> 02:23:43,650
I'll hang out with sometimes. And she
goes, you don't have to. I mean, honestly,

2535
02:23:43,651 --> 02:23:47,520
our relationship has only ever like
that one thing. And I was like, yeah,

2536
02:23:47,610 --> 02:23:50,450
you're right. It was,
wow. That's a lot to you.

2537
02:23:50,460 --> 02:23:52,980
So you offered to just hang
out and be like a nice guy. No.

2538
02:23:53,010 --> 02:23:57,200
First off to hang out and then also sex,
but I don't spell that out. I was also,

2539
02:23:57,240 --> 02:24:01,540
I see, so you felt like if you got close
to her and you're hanging out together,

2540
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:03,810
sex with probably happening.
I'm sure it would,

2541
02:24:03,811 --> 02:24:06,030
but I was also like lonely in
that city. I was like, Hey,

2542
02:24:06,031 --> 02:24:09,400
there's some new movie out this week.
You want to go see it? And then, yeah,

2543
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:11,940
you don't have to say, obviously we're
going to fucking play their music playing,

2544
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,540
Bro. What's the music sound like?
Like a Cat Stevens Song. Oh, nice.

2545
02:24:16,140 --> 02:24:19,160
Cat's in the cradle and dad.

2546
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:26,850
That was the hold music they played
for the homer lost his child.

2547
02:24:26,851 --> 02:24:27,840
I couldn't find Bart,

2548
02:24:27,980 --> 02:24:30,580
so I was like missing persons and
they start playing that for the, Oh,

2549
02:24:30,670 --> 02:24:34,740
God is crying. Wow. That's rough.

2550
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:39,810
Yeah, it's w you know, I read
something, it was like advice to men.

2551
02:24:39,900 --> 02:24:42,960
It was like all these different, and one
of them was one of the pieces of advice.

2552
02:24:42,961 --> 02:24:46,890
Never go back with an ex.
Well you anymore? Yeah.

2553
02:24:46,900 --> 02:24:49,030
It was a reason it didn't work out. She
didn't really want any more. I'm like,

2554
02:24:49,320 --> 02:24:53,400
that's so generalizing because how many
times have you gotten back with an ax

2555
02:24:53,430 --> 02:24:56,640
and have the best sex and the
history of the fucking universe?

2556
02:24:57,240 --> 02:25:00,030
We don't see each other for a long time.

2557
02:25:00,610 --> 02:25:03,470
People your heart.
We also send lots of

2558
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:06,540
Christ.

2559
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:10,880
What is this blue it miss you like
fucking clay face from that man.

2560
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:15,410
You pretended to be Ra coast now with
his emotions. I'll get rained on you.

2561
02:25:15,411 --> 02:25:19,110
You Bitch and you'll turn back into
Clayface as all lower once in awhile.

2562
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:21,570
Who the fuck are you done with?

2563
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:26,800
Are you in love right now?
You tell me about your soul.

2564
02:25:29,320 --> 02:25:32,530
It's pretty right now
so rudely interrupted.

2565
02:25:33,430 --> 02:25:37,220
I don't even know something
about your feelings. Your
stupid. Oh, I was like, yeah,

2566
02:25:37,230 --> 02:25:39,190
be, if you get back with it,
I can't forget her heart.

2567
02:25:39,220 --> 02:25:41,020
They're going to hurt you again if that's
what he's that we just talked about

2568
02:25:41,021 --> 02:25:43,840
sex. Yeah, but it's a careful
your heart. Jesus Christ.

2569
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:47,450
You should write songs that arrive.

2570
02:25:47,480 --> 02:25:50,770
Otherwise I would love to see
you like swaying back and forth.

2571
02:25:52,020 --> 02:25:56,290
Same cricket. It's like a real serious
stuff song. Hey there, Delilah,

2572
02:25:56,950 --> 02:25:59,230
you singing like a real serious song?

2573
02:25:59,231 --> 02:26:03,250
Like maybe like counting crow style.
Yeah.

2574
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:10,980
Careful with your remote.
Really remote with it. No,

2575
02:26:10,990 --> 02:26:15,150
man, some of the best times ever in the
lyrics will be real quiet. He like, Eh,

2576
02:26:16,220 --> 02:26:17,240
no,

2577
02:26:22,660 --> 02:26:23,800
it's bad advice.
Right.

2578
02:26:23,890 --> 02:26:28,890
You know what it's like if it's
like saying there's no weirdness.

2579
02:26:29,471 --> 02:26:32,120
If you hang out with an extra
definitely fucker. Yeah.

2580
02:26:32,170 --> 02:26:34,600
And it's probably going to be
really fun. Oh yeah. Freeing.

2581
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:40,060
Freeing because you'll know what it
is. Yeah. I mean, the idea that she's,

2582
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:44,080
come on, man. Oh, I missed you
would like this for a while.

2583
02:26:44,081 --> 02:26:48,820
Sometimes it works sometimes. Sometimes
you apologize for how it went bad.

2584
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:51,460
Yeah.
Sometimes you fucked like wild animals.

2585
02:26:51,910 --> 02:26:56,510
And then about five hours into it they
said something that reminds you how

2586
02:26:56,630 --> 02:26:59,950
fucking knowing they were and you're
like, oh my God, what am I doing, Jill?

2587
02:26:59,951 --> 02:27:03,500
Sobule he used to have a song
about, uh, about, um, uh,

2588
02:27:04,510 --> 02:27:08,020
prove my lack of heterosexuality lists.
Look, listen to Jill still believe,

2589
02:27:08,410 --> 02:27:12,430
but she's of a song about forgetting
guys like smile and then like, oh yeah,

2590
02:27:12,431 --> 02:27:15,400
it's such a great smile and forgetting
why she broke up with him. I was like,

2591
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:19,750
Oh yeah, you tried to fuck all my friends.
That's right. I remember that part now.

2592
02:27:19,930 --> 02:27:22,960
But that smile when you over again.
It's very difficult.

2593
02:27:22,990 --> 02:27:27,700
If a girl has a nice ass to remember all
the mean girl has a great ass and she's

2594
02:27:27,701 --> 02:27:29,860
DTF. Yeah, you're hanging out.

2595
02:27:31,170 --> 02:27:34,120
You know you both single,
he got a couple of cocktails in you.

2596
02:27:34,121 --> 02:27:35,770
You just have it in me in that same town.

2597
02:27:36,610 --> 02:27:39,370
She just touches your
skin throughout here. Nah,

2598
02:27:39,430 --> 02:27:43,520
no little Kissy kissy kissing
your Dick is like a God damn crow.

2599
02:27:43,521 --> 02:27:45,940
Look who's back here.
Look who's back

2600
02:27:47,750 --> 02:27:50,790
ready to fuck.
Sometimes you get to talk,

2601
02:27:50,830 --> 02:27:53,290
she can just talk to you and
you're like up there it is. Yeah.

2602
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:54,870
There's certain girls that are sex here.
Yeah,

2603
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:58,450
and I'm sure there's certain guys that
are sexier too. I'm sure it's girls.

2604
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:00,820
There's a lot of shit.
You and I both do that.

2605
02:28:00,821 --> 02:28:03,910
It's really fucking annoying
and it's a real vagina drier,

2606
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:08,380
a real fucking close this show, right?
Every guy. I mean there's, yeah,

2607
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:13,490
there's first for every girl. The
first time, first time I went through,

2608
02:28:13,530 --> 02:28:17,170
I saw a girl hot walking across
the whole like Faneuil hall.

2609
02:28:17,350 --> 02:28:18,450
I see her crossing the hallway.

2610
02:28:18,470 --> 02:28:20,980
The show's over and she was crossing from
the bathrooms back there all the way.

2611
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:22,040
I'm looking at it the whole

2612
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:26,360
way and then she gets up to me,
you are wicked funny how much?

2613
02:28:26,361 --> 02:28:29,720
Piss myself and I'm like,
there it goes.

2614
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:35,960
That's designed that way to
keep them. Keep you. Yeah.
Nature designs it that way.

2615
02:28:35,990 --> 02:28:38,870
Keep them alone both to keep
you from wanting to do that.

2616
02:28:39,620 --> 02:28:43,040
Keep you from breathing. You've
been enlightened. You've escaped.

2617
02:28:43,220 --> 02:28:46,880
You escaped from that. That east
coast lightened shrimp fest this year,

2618
02:28:46,881 --> 02:28:50,360
August 9th 10th and 11th Oh shit.
Wants to participate.

2619
02:28:50,420 --> 02:28:53,480
Everybody who participates,
participates online simultaneously,

2620
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:58,270
allegedly just do mushrooms.
August 9th 10th and 11th Yeah.

2621
02:28:58,650 --> 02:29:02,450
If you want to know how to find them.
I wrote a a or a what they're all about.

2622
02:29:02,451 --> 02:29:04,570
I wrote a primer online you can go to,

2623
02:29:04,571 --> 02:29:06,800
it's pretty much answers every question
you've ever had about mushrooms.

2624
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:09,530
If you just Google Ari
Shaffir Shrimp Fest Primer,

2625
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:13,370
are you worried about advertising shrimp
fest that you might be targeted by the

2626
02:29:13,371 --> 02:29:17,750
feds as what? As a shroom,
a supporter? Nah, man,

2627
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:19,820
I live for, wow, you do live free.

2628
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:23,060
Sometimes it's finding any reason
delivery at all. I'm like, Nah,

2629
02:29:23,190 --> 02:29:25,640
I don't think we're not coming.
We're not going to act on that.

2630
02:29:26,060 --> 02:29:28,100
It's the dumbest set of rules ever.
Yeah.

2631
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:31,160
The fact that you go to cvs and buy a
gallon of whiskey and drink yourself to

2632
02:29:31,161 --> 02:29:33,820
death in the parking lot easily,
no one could stop you. Yeah.

2633
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:36,820
The fact that that's possible.
I'm not facilitating any mushrooms.

2634
02:29:36,910 --> 02:29:40,670
I'm not pitching it for people. I'm
just fucking, yeah, you're right.

2635
02:29:40,671 --> 02:29:43,340
Everybody fucking, if you should
do it, we should all do it. Yeah.

2636
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:45,890
That's how loss change anyway.
You know who shouldn't do it?

2637
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:47,930
Who Does the training now?

2638
02:29:47,931 --> 02:29:52,760
He definitely showed he belonged
or 23 and even if they do it,

2639
02:29:53,150 --> 02:29:56,830
whatever, that seems old. I'd go,

2640
02:29:56,840 --> 02:30:01,070
you're arguing that that's fine. It
depends on their upbringing. Not Bad.

2641
02:30:01,071 --> 02:30:01,491
I don't know.

2642
02:30:01,491 --> 02:30:04,130
I had some cool friends in high school
with did it that I was always scared me,

2643
02:30:04,131 --> 02:30:07,520
but if we're going to allow people to
drink at 21 how can you not allow them to

2644
02:30:07,521 --> 02:30:11,900
take mushrooms too?
I say realistically 16 and a half.

2645
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:13,513
That's not bad.

2646
02:30:13,580 --> 02:30:18,580
If you have community centers where you
could give these kids like a dose that

2647
02:30:19,910 --> 02:30:23,750
you know it's like super safe. Even
if they don't what is, he'll be fine.

2648
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:25,340
What if the only way to get mushrooms,

2649
02:30:25,350 --> 02:30:27,290
like I'm not saying the kid should
do mushrooms, don't get me wrong,

2650
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:30,470
let's go to your counselor or something.
Joe Rogan says kids should do mushrooms.

2651
02:30:30,471 --> 02:30:31,880
I'm not saying they should go do machines,

2652
02:30:31,881 --> 02:30:36,680
but if a 16 year old wanted
to do mushrooms and they
just got them on their own

2653
02:30:36,681 --> 02:30:40,670
and took them, absolutely, absolutely.
You don't know how strong it is.

2654
02:30:40,671 --> 02:30:42,420
You don't take,
don't get behind the wheel with this.

2655
02:30:42,421 --> 02:30:44,150
It's going to really fuck you
up and here's the reality.

2656
02:30:44,310 --> 02:30:47,090
How someone like you're actually to help
you with it. We'll do it. They did it.

2657
02:30:47,091 --> 02:30:47,901
When I was in high school,

2658
02:30:47,901 --> 02:30:50,960
there was always kids did mushrooms
and fucking listen to the wall.

2659
02:30:50,990 --> 02:30:55,250
You know what Vancouver's got in Hastings
in the fucking air, the heroin area.

2660
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:58,520
They have safe shoot up places that smart.
We can go tell them what I'm taking.

2661
02:30:58,521 --> 02:30:59,660
So if you overdose,

2662
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:03,680
they know they can like whatever help
you as best they can instead of like lips

2663
02:31:03,990 --> 02:31:06,860
hiding it. It's like they're going to
do it. Why are we not helping them?

2664
02:31:06,861 --> 02:31:08,510
So people are gonna do mushrooms.
Absolutely.

2665
02:31:08,810 --> 02:31:12,980
It's to talk to your guidance counselor
in high school about it. Yeah, it's smart.

2666
02:31:13,060 --> 02:31:16,250
Yeah. It's smart to do it
the right way. You take no,

2667
02:31:16,251 --> 02:31:20,070
you don't need an ounce absolute and you
have Jesus Christ and you're not taking

2668
02:31:20,071 --> 02:31:22,320
an ounce. You're going to
take us down. You're crazy.

2669
02:31:23,140 --> 02:31:25,890
If you freak out and then you're gonna
come back tomorrow when I talk to you

2670
02:31:25,891 --> 02:31:29,040
about how silicide infects the brain.
So I get a cab next time we'll take more.

2671
02:31:29,070 --> 02:31:31,310
Here's all the benefits of silicide.
Here's what they've shown.

2672
02:31:31,320 --> 02:31:34,950
John Hopkins University showed that.
Fascinating.

2673
02:31:35,260 --> 02:31:39,870
That's what if they had like certain
drugs that were not just legal but

2674
02:31:39,871 --> 02:31:40,704
respected,

2675
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:44,160
like that's the real problem with things
like a psychedelic drug to research

2676
02:31:44,161 --> 02:31:48,060
them because, exactly. You can. We can
now. They can now more than ever before.

2677
02:31:48,061 --> 02:31:51,690
They can get the rights to and Strassman
did all those studies on DMT and then

2678
02:31:51,691 --> 02:31:55,770
new ones on DMT. They got new ones going
on right now. I you have to eventually.

2679
02:31:58,070 --> 02:32:01,770
Yeah. Shouldn't dd, but only if
it's legal under the God's law.

2680
02:32:02,310 --> 02:32:06,590
[inaudible] Winnipeg, but he
freaked me out. He was like,
he was like, Hey, here's,

2681
02:32:07,030 --> 02:32:09,390
it's just like, oh, really? Wow. It
was like, maybe if I get the right,

2682
02:32:09,670 --> 02:32:12,090
I think it goes, but if you don't
do it, don't give it to anyone.

2683
02:32:12,091 --> 02:32:13,460
Just throw it out.
Oh,

2684
02:32:15,300 --> 02:32:18,740
she's just crying like that. Don't
give it to anybody. What happened?

2685
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:22,950
What's in this? Yeah. You
fucking crazy ass hole. No Way.

2686
02:32:23,410 --> 02:32:24,680
Mixing some he's fees.

2687
02:32:24,820 --> 02:32:27,570
He's got your phone and he knows
exactly where you are at all times.

2688
02:32:27,810 --> 02:32:31,440
You just got your phone's location
addresses hooked up to his laptop and he's

2689
02:32:31,441 --> 02:32:33,450
following you around in a
fucking bulletproof van.

2690
02:32:33,990 --> 02:32:36,000
Solid rubber tires like the punisher

2691
02:32:38,540 --> 02:32:43,470
throw you back there. You for a fuck ride.
Thinks you're funny. Huh? Amazing Racist.

2692
02:32:43,471 --> 02:32:47,970
My mother is half Mexican
flux your face while you're out cold.

2693
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:51,090
Yeah. Not good dude. Don't do
it. You, you're very smart.

2694
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:53,130
They told me they had mushrooms in,
in Hong Kong.

2695
02:32:53,460 --> 02:32:56,830
I found some people that were pacos lists
as these musicians are out there and

2696
02:32:56,930 --> 02:33:00,570
he sets up because I made a joke about
mushrooms and he goes uh, and he's like,

2697
02:33:00,571 --> 02:33:00,991
Oh yeah,

2698
02:33:00,991 --> 02:33:03,600
you know I get in my heart as I heard
it from the Joe Rogan experience podcast

2699
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:06,240
and I was like, where did you get him out
of here? Cause they're in the woods, man.

2700
02:33:06,241 --> 02:33:08,460
Hong Kong has has woods
and it's humid is shit.

2701
02:33:09,090 --> 02:33:11,040
Like how do you know what to pick?
He goes,

2702
02:33:11,041 --> 02:33:13,950
I did a lot of research that you
cross reference it with pictures.

2703
02:33:14,910 --> 02:33:18,030
Mckenna talked about all the different
varieties that look like siliciden

2704
02:33:18,031 --> 02:33:21,960
mushrooms but it's super toxic poisons.
Yeah. Those are like the red ones.

2705
02:33:21,961 --> 02:33:22,860
I'm like,
I don't know man.

2706
02:33:22,860 --> 02:33:25,560
That seems like I would get out
warning for the summer plant. Yeah.

2707
02:33:25,561 --> 02:33:28,940
Like how many to miscarry?
I might take it into answers.

2708
02:33:28,950 --> 02:33:30,210
Drug dealer had nothing on that.

2709
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:33,240
You know what the other problem with
that am Anita miscarry and one is never

2710
02:33:33,241 --> 02:33:35,190
talked to a single person who
had a real trip with them.

2711
02:33:35,610 --> 02:33:38,450
You take people had people taking them,
take them and they don't know.

2712
02:33:38,620 --> 02:33:41,310
Not really a mushroom. Right. You're
different than a regular mushroom. Well,

2713
02:33:41,311 --> 02:33:44,190
it's not silicide been right.
That's what else. That's what it is.

2714
02:33:44,191 --> 02:33:46,980
It's some other end
different psychoactive. Yeah,

2715
02:33:47,010 --> 02:33:50,550
and they think that the silicide that the
mushrooms are you getting now when you

2716
02:33:50,551 --> 02:33:53,160
get an Amanita miscarry for folks who
don't know what the fuck we're talking

2717
02:33:53,161 --> 02:33:54,630
about,
Google Ama,

2718
02:33:54,631 --> 02:33:59,580
Nida must scary a mushroom and religion.
Google religion,

2719
02:33:59,590 --> 02:34:02,670
because it's connected to a lot of
religions. It's connected to Santa Claus.

2720
02:34:02,910 --> 02:34:05,820
It's supposed to be the original Santa
Claus. Just Google it and figure it out.

2721
02:34:05,821 --> 02:34:06,780
Your honor.
It's fascinating,

2722
02:34:06,781 --> 02:34:08,880
but we've talked about it too
much on the podcast to go on,

2723
02:34:08,881 --> 02:34:11,910
but it's apparently different
than silicide, but it has another,

2724
02:34:12,330 --> 02:34:14,070
it's another different type of,

2725
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:17,170
but I've never heard a single person
who's done it, who got off on it,

2726
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:22,420
who had like a real psychedelic
experience. I did it with Doug, Doug,

2727
02:34:22,421 --> 02:34:25,300
and I did it on the day of the Iraq war.

2728
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:29,360
Me and Doug and Yon Urban,
I remember. Yeah, yeah.

2729
02:34:29,820 --> 02:34:32,530
Yon Cooked it up and we drank this tea.

2730
02:34:32,531 --> 02:34:37,531
But Mckenna was saying that
those mushrooms may be,

2731
02:34:38,300 --> 02:34:42,340
they may be different genetically
and seasonally and yeah,

2732
02:34:42,470 --> 02:34:45,550
and also on there as well. If you've got
a cherries out of Susan, that was sweet.

2733
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:49,630
Yeah, and apparently you, you got
to catch them in the right area.

2734
02:34:49,870 --> 02:34:53,350
You got to get them from the right,
like the right branch of this,

2735
02:34:53,351 --> 02:34:57,880
this mushroom tree that's grown or
whatever it is for calling New York.

2736
02:34:58,480 --> 02:35:00,250
Exactly.
Something along those lines.

2737
02:35:00,310 --> 02:35:02,440
But the ones that we're getting
today are just bullshit,

2738
02:35:02,590 --> 02:35:05,680
but apparently in some parts of the world,
some people know how to do it right.

2739
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:08,350
The ones we'll cultivate them on purpose.
So letting them grow.

2740
02:35:08,380 --> 02:35:11,680
But it's not like silicide like psilocybin
mushrooms get you off no matter where

2741
02:35:11,681 --> 02:35:12,430
the fuck you are.

2742
02:35:12,430 --> 02:35:16,610
Every new owner who takes some
psilocybin mushrooms produce sales Simon,

2743
02:35:16,810 --> 02:35:19,750
that's what they are.
You know there's still a Feria cubensis.

2744
02:35:19,751 --> 02:35:21,810
There's a bunch of different
types of these similars,

2745
02:35:22,030 --> 02:35:26,500
but all of them that have silicide knock
you into fucking Jupiter that doesn't

2746
02:35:26,501 --> 02:35:27,940
work that way with the MNA to Mascara.

2747
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:31,450
So a lot of people are confused about the
original use of the laminated miscarry

2748
02:35:31,460 --> 02:35:31,990
and his office.

2749
02:35:31,990 --> 02:35:36,940
Like there's like all this speculation
about it being attached to Christianity

2750
02:35:36,941 --> 02:35:40,870
and all these ancient religions and all
these people look at like all these old

2751
02:35:40,871 --> 02:35:45,610
cards and things from, from the 18
hundreds Santa Claus on Christmas card,

2752
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:47,500
the all the Amnio miscarry attached to it.

2753
02:35:47,770 --> 02:35:51,670
That mushroom was like a big part of
Christian folk, Lord Carter Brothers too.

2754
02:35:51,671 --> 02:35:54,160
I don't know if that got them there.
They didn't know. No one knew.

2755
02:35:54,190 --> 02:35:56,230
So they just thought like, oh, I'll put
this. We're looking at mushroom man.

2756
02:35:56,410 --> 02:36:00,970
No one really. It was mainstream for
a small period of time in the 1970s,

2757
02:36:01,210 --> 02:36:04,570
but the Catholic Church bought off the
rights to the John Marco Allegro books.

2758
02:36:04,630 --> 02:36:09,370
Really? Yeah. Well one of them is
still available. The worst Catholics,

2759
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:13,240
the new pope's. The good guy though,
seems like a nice guy. I guess

2760
02:36:17,820 --> 02:36:21,340
he, uh, this John Mako allegro guy wrote
a book called the sacred mushroom and the

2761
02:36:21,341 --> 02:36:22,090
cross.

2762
02:36:22,090 --> 02:36:24,910
And the reason why it was significant
is he was one of the scholars that was,

2763
02:36:25,360 --> 02:36:30,070
that's what helps start Christianity.
Oh no, that, yeah. They were like,

2764
02:36:30,071 --> 02:36:31,570
fuck this.
So they bought up the rights.

2765
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:34,210
It connected the mushroom to
Jesus and a bunch of other shit.

2766
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:35,231
They bought up the rights to it,

2767
02:36:35,231 --> 02:36:36,790
but they didn't buy up the
rights to the other one.

2768
02:36:36,791 --> 02:36:38,860
The Dead Sea Scrolls
in the Christian myth,

2769
02:36:39,100 --> 02:36:42,070
which is even more inflammatory in
its title. Sort of like to go, hey,

2770
02:36:42,071 --> 02:36:43,690
you can't silence silence me Dick Heads.

2771
02:36:43,691 --> 02:36:46,350
I'll just write another one and I'll
write it with another company. Right.

2772
02:36:46,400 --> 02:36:47,150
You can read that one.

2773
02:36:47,150 --> 02:36:50,680
You could still buy the sacred mushroom
and the cross you have to buy. Um,

2774
02:36:50,860 --> 02:36:52,150
you have to get it. Oh, actually,

2775
02:36:52,151 --> 02:36:54,820
young urbanites published
automatically illegally downloaded.

2776
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,310
No Yon urban started
publishing them again. Yeah.

2777
02:36:57,410 --> 02:37:01,410
He started publishing it again two
years ago before that it was used.

2778
02:37:01,450 --> 02:37:03,880
I have a couple of copies of it,
but they're all really old.

2779
02:37:04,270 --> 02:37:05,560
I got him from a used bookstore.

2780
02:37:05,610 --> 02:37:09,070
That's Christianity and what doesn't
want people knowing that they didn't back

2781
02:37:09,071 --> 02:37:10,060
then,
that's for fuck short,

2782
02:37:10,061 --> 02:37:13,090
was that Simpsons where homer had a
crayon up his nose and it went through his

2783
02:37:13,091 --> 02:37:14,260
brain and made him super smart.

2784
02:37:14,770 --> 02:37:19,160
And he like came with a proof that
there's no such thing as God gave it to a

2785
02:37:19,250 --> 02:37:23,310
next door neighbor. So there's
no, there's no, no, no,

2786
02:37:24,650 --> 02:37:29,480
no. What Mr. Burns. Yeah. He goes, well,

2787
02:37:29,481 --> 02:37:33,710
I can't be true. And he's like,
oh, that. Yeah, that meant.
Oh Wow. And he goes, well,

2788
02:37:33,711 --> 02:37:37,820
we can't let this get out. He has a
burns it immediately. Wow. It's like, oh,

2789
02:37:37,821 --> 02:37:41,280
we can't let them be approved for no god.
Yeah.

2790
02:37:41,330 --> 02:37:45,410
I don't know what the fuck they would
do. Like what if they found today? Yeah.

2791
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:48,620
Like what if they found in
controvertible evidence,

2792
02:37:49,240 --> 02:37:53,720
the Catholic Church found
in controvertible evidence
that Christianity was

2793
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:58,340
designed by aliens to keep airline
until they, until they land to bury it.

2794
02:37:58,400 --> 02:38:02,000
I'll give you a, an analogy. You
wouldn't, they found like one of those,

2795
02:38:03,020 --> 02:38:07,960
let Colby want help me open one. You're
my only hope. They hit some thing again.

2796
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:12,770
Shows up and explains how
humans are created. Oh, Ron
Hubbard. Alien. Hold close.

2797
02:38:12,870 --> 02:38:16,610
Banging a monkey. Yeah,
shooting the load into a monkey.

2798
02:38:17,480 --> 02:38:21,140
Shaking it up in a test tube point.
Human being pops out.

2799
02:38:21,710 --> 02:38:23,290
I think they keep going because the,

2800
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:26,720
for the same reason Philip Morris kept
going, I found out. They're like, well,

2801
02:38:26,721 --> 02:38:28,260
we've got a good business going now.
Yeah,

2802
02:38:28,270 --> 02:38:30,680
well I'm not giving up my house
and based on nothing. Who Cares?

2803
02:38:30,770 --> 02:38:33,410
I have a castle in Tahiti,
so let people smoke cigarettes.

2804
02:38:33,740 --> 02:38:36,540
They're gonna smoke anyway.
Yeah, we tell them it's bad.

2805
02:38:36,541 --> 02:38:38,990
Will need to worship
the worship cigarettes

2806
02:38:42,230 --> 02:38:46,430
and the pig it even the silly bitch.
Jesus Christ.

2807
02:38:46,670 --> 02:38:48,620
How dare you.
How dare you.

2808
02:38:48,621 --> 02:38:53,000
I've got another story for you about what
you have such an interesting, go ahead.

2809
02:38:53,001 --> 02:38:54,350
Go ahead and pee red.
Uh,

2810
02:38:54,410 --> 02:38:58,300
for folks who don't know how such an
interesting take on religion and a

2811
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:02,030
religious fundamentalist religion.

2812
02:39:02,090 --> 02:39:07,090
I write ideas cause he lived in a
crazy religious community in um,

2813
02:39:08,570 --> 02:39:13,570
not a kibbutz but one of those things in
Israel and studied the Talmud for like

2814
02:39:14,750 --> 02:39:19,700
12 hours a day every day and had all
these super specific rules and then went

2815
02:39:19,701 --> 02:39:23,570
from there to become within a couple
of years he was a dirty comedian,

2816
02:39:23,990 --> 02:39:26,840
which is amazing.
And like the exact opposite.

2817
02:39:26,841 --> 02:39:29,950
Like not only was he just a dirty
comic but he was doing like, you know,

2818
02:39:29,951 --> 02:39:33,830
like that those videos that he
was doing that was very, you know,

2819
02:39:33,890 --> 02:39:38,120
jokingly racist and he went from
like the opposite in immediately.

2820
02:39:38,290 --> 02:39:42,380
Well he went in very inflammatory shock
humor stuff that he thinks is funny.

2821
02:39:42,630 --> 02:39:45,380
Yeah, but we're talking about
you dude, how weird it is.

2822
02:39:45,381 --> 02:39:48,650
You're like one of the only dudes that
I know that went from being like a very,

2823
02:39:48,651 --> 02:39:50,840
in a very strict religious upbringing,

2824
02:39:51,020 --> 02:39:55,520
like about as strict as you can get to
becoming an open minded, dirty comedian.

2825
02:39:55,521 --> 02:39:56,870
He starts up mushroom festival.

2826
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:01,290
Probably the only one who the
fuck else is there by herself.

2827
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:05,820
There were a few others
that were religious. I got
out. Yeah, that's correct.

2828
02:40:05,821 --> 02:40:08,180
Pete Holmes. Yeah. There's
definitely a few that got out,

2829
02:40:08,330 --> 02:40:12,870
but not like as far out as you got kind
of linger around the edge. They dance.

2830
02:40:13,030 --> 02:40:14,040
It's pretty odd.
Mascara hates

2831
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:18,000
religion. Kurt Mascara. Yeah,
we'll, we'll, we'll see.
He was a Jehovah's witness.

2832
02:40:18,060 --> 02:40:20,760
Oh yeah.
Oh my God.

2833
02:40:20,820 --> 02:40:24,180
It was real deep in the a brother
so-and-so brother Joe Brother Brian.

2834
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:27,050
That's unfortunate. Yeah, but
now he's fused at the same way.

2835
02:40:27,130 --> 02:40:30,260
These bring up these and he, he breaks
them down to, he says his thing.

2836
02:40:30,261 --> 02:40:35,040
It's like there's no justification in
the Bible for killing someone at war.

2837
02:40:35,670 --> 02:40:38,220
War has nothing to do.
There's no nations in the Bible.

2838
02:40:38,221 --> 02:40:41,430
You're not allowed to just cause Americans
attacking Iraq and not allowed to go

2839
02:40:41,431 --> 02:40:43,560
in and kill an Iraqi.
It's still do not kill.

2840
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:47,650
It's a good point that there's no way
around it. There's no way around it. Yeah,

2841
02:40:47,910 --> 02:40:51,050
and he talks about stuff
like bacon up in kosher.

2842
02:40:51,090 --> 02:40:52,840
Then it always comes back to like
something. Why was that in the Bible?

2843
02:40:52,841 --> 02:40:57,060
I was like, oh cause it's made up.
Like why is it explanation of that?

2844
02:40:57,061 --> 02:41:01,230
Because it's clearly made up. Well it
has to be made up. Everything's made up.

2845
02:41:01,250 --> 02:41:04,950
Yeah. We know that.
Look, if it's not like,

2846
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:09,750
could you imagine if you're dealing
with a religion that the people that all

2847
02:41:09,751 --> 02:41:12,810
practice that religion
are clearly elevated,

2848
02:41:12,840 --> 02:41:17,820
they're clearly in some incredible place
where they never lie and they're only

2849
02:41:17,821 --> 02:41:22,260
altruistic and their motives and their
super kind. They're super honest and they,

2850
02:41:22,261 --> 02:41:24,450
they,
they live universally.

2851
02:41:24,451 --> 02:41:29,451
There's no variation universally by
this intense moral code and this,

2852
02:41:29,701 --> 02:41:33,630
this, this projecting of love
and understanding everywhere.

2853
02:41:33,631 --> 02:41:36,270
So much so that like you felt it
when you were near them. Like wow,

2854
02:41:36,271 --> 02:41:39,220
that guy's clearly a Catholic priest.
You know what I mean?

2855
02:41:39,390 --> 02:41:43,140
Like if that was a thing, it was a thing
where these people would never lie.

2856
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:46,340
They would never cover up.
Then what child rape they would know.

2857
02:41:46,440 --> 02:41:49,860
Then you might listen to that.
Then you might say, okay,

2858
02:41:49,861 --> 02:41:53,160
well maybe these guys really did find
the word of God and if the word of God

2859
02:41:53,161 --> 02:41:56,760
made a lot of sense, if it doesn't
make sense to people, well, you know,

2860
02:41:56,820 --> 02:42:00,870
God works in mysterious ways or retards
wrote a book and you're asking me to

2861
02:42:00,871 --> 02:42:04,590
follow up book that retards road they
used to sell it to, if you it enough,

2862
02:42:04,591 --> 02:42:06,720
they would sell you at these tickets.
I forgot what they're called,

2863
02:42:06,721 --> 02:42:08,190
but he's tickets into heaven.
Oh yeah.

2864
02:42:08,220 --> 02:42:11,580
And they started selling to rich people
and that, I mean the priests, the pope's,

2865
02:42:11,581 --> 02:42:12,440
they would do that in.
I could do it.

2866
02:42:12,510 --> 02:42:17,400
That's not even close to the worst thing
they've done. No, no, not even close.

2867
02:42:17,550 --> 02:42:21,000
Not even close. But how about the
last pope himself, the last pope,

2868
02:42:21,090 --> 02:42:25,470
the last guy is really,
he's guilty of crimes against humans,

2869
02:42:25,650 --> 02:42:30,150
crimes against nature. He was one of the
guys that diverted a priest, pedophiles.

2870
02:42:30,330 --> 02:42:33,750
He diverted them to new places, the
new market, and they did it again.

2871
02:42:33,880 --> 02:42:35,160
And it's like,
this is your head.

2872
02:42:35,161 --> 02:42:37,350
That means you're the head of your
organization is going to do that.

2873
02:42:37,351 --> 02:42:38,940
And you're still going to
be in that organization.

2874
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:42,250
One of them raped a hundred deaf kids.
Oh,

2875
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:44,160
wrap your head around that.

2876
02:42:44,820 --> 02:42:49,820
The priest was directly responsible for
moving a guy who raped like a hundred

2877
02:42:50,290 --> 02:42:51,123
delegates.

2878
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:52,560
Okay.

2879
02:42:52,560 --> 02:42:56,220
The official numbers, like speculation
between 30 a hundred I mean,

2880
02:42:56,221 --> 02:42:59,520
this is going going on for 1500 years.
Oh yeah.

2881
02:42:59,550 --> 02:43:01,150
Probably since the beginning of the,
the,

2882
02:43:01,160 --> 02:43:03,630
the times where they made them sell a bit.

2883
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:06,660
Probably when they started fucking kids,

2884
02:43:07,860 --> 02:43:09,270
probably when they started covering it up.

2885
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:11,433
I mean,

2886
02:43:11,570 --> 02:43:11,901
I mean,

2887
02:43:11,901 --> 02:43:15,860
it's amazing that you have one religion
and this is a religion that I come from,

2888
02:43:15,861 --> 02:43:18,830
by the way, one sec to the religion.
One Sec doesn't Christianity.

2889
02:43:18,860 --> 02:43:22,190
What specifically this I think of
Catholicism has his own religion.

2890
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:24,170
I guess you're right.
It's just don't do this,

2891
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:26,630
but the Christian Catholics don't
think of themselves as Christians.

2892
02:43:26,810 --> 02:43:27,780
You talked to a Catholic,

2893
02:43:27,850 --> 02:43:30,200
it's very rare that a Catholic considers
themselves a Christian and they

2894
02:43:30,201 --> 02:43:33,920
consider themselves Catholic.
Yeah. Egyptians don't
criticize ourselves as Arab,

2895
02:43:34,250 --> 02:43:36,620
but get over yourself there
in Africa though. Yeah.

2896
02:43:36,621 --> 02:43:41,480
There no one ever Arab shut up.
That's not a Rabia.

2897
02:43:41,481 --> 02:43:44,990
Who are you guys? An asshole.

2898
02:43:45,530 --> 02:43:46,640
But Catholics,

2899
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:51,530
the one religion that's explicitly
connected to raping children.

2900
02:43:51,620 --> 02:43:53,720
Yeah. There's no other
than the newsletter. Look,

2901
02:43:53,721 --> 02:43:57,260
there's old people in all sex
of life that do terrible people.

2902
02:43:57,620 --> 02:44:00,380
It's systematic, systematic, systemic.

2903
02:44:00,381 --> 02:44:03,960
Over the years been covered up and
can and made to continue. Yeah.

2904
02:44:04,040 --> 02:44:07,370
Instead of going, Oh yeah, you, oh,
cares what you are. You've done this.

2905
02:44:07,371 --> 02:44:10,160
We're going to report you to the police
and try to get you to stop doing. It.

2906
02:44:10,790 --> 02:44:13,800
Used to be the responsibilities
of Catholic church. Now let it go.

2907
02:44:13,850 --> 02:44:16,220
Not Not even cover it up and
make sure it never happens again.

2908
02:44:16,810 --> 02:44:19,340
Discuss should go to jail as
a warning to other priests.

2909
02:44:19,820 --> 02:44:24,440
He was accused of crimes against
humanity by victims of sex abuse victims,

2910
02:44:24,450 --> 02:44:29,270
concrete to the international criminal
court accuses Pope Benedict and three

2911
02:44:29,271 --> 02:44:34,271
others of failing to prevent abusers
and hiding them and moving them.

2912
02:44:34,491 --> 02:44:35,660
Yeah, he's, he's a criminal.

2913
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:39,530
He knew that this guy was fucking
kids and moved them to a place.

2914
02:44:39,900 --> 02:44:44,900
Just the idea that you are in charge of
administering the law in some way and

2915
02:44:45,111 --> 02:44:45,980
you're so ignorant,

2916
02:44:46,130 --> 02:44:48,680
you don't understand the recidivism
rates for child molesters.

2917
02:44:49,070 --> 02:44:53,000
Like that's criminally ignorant or
it's either that or you are complicit.

2918
02:44:53,330 --> 02:44:56,570
It's one of the two textures you're
trying to protect your business. Yeah.

2919
02:44:56,590 --> 02:44:59,150
Like this would be bad news for let's
cover it up. There's no other options,

2920
02:44:59,151 --> 02:45:01,810
right. Those are the only
two options. So why is he,

2921
02:45:01,850 --> 02:45:04,630
why is that guy wandering around?
Why isn't that guy locked in?

2922
02:45:04,650 --> 02:45:07,170
Kitchen one wasn't, remember those
people that in China that um, that the,

2923
02:45:07,210 --> 02:45:08,510
the baby powder formula,

2924
02:45:09,010 --> 02:45:13,680
the formula powder that I could be like
20 kids died from this baby powder. Yeah.

2925
02:45:13,810 --> 02:45:17,780
Um, and they found out what the CEOs of
that company were doing was putting this

2926
02:45:17,781 --> 02:45:21,530
enzyme in that would make a test
higher for purities. But this enzyme,

2927
02:45:21,531 --> 02:45:25,100
they just add it on their own, was also
had toxins in it and it killed 20 people.

2928
02:45:25,130 --> 02:45:26,990
They just murdered those people.
Chinese government said,

2929
02:45:27,020 --> 02:45:30,200
we're going to kill you all. Now. How
about what happened with d would GM what?

2930
02:45:30,201 --> 02:45:32,540
These fucking cars,
they cover it up.

2931
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:35,540
I didn't believe Sam triple was on the
podcast and he was talking about it in

2932
02:45:35,541 --> 02:45:37,940
sort of vague terms. He didn't know
that though. Right? And I believe him.

2933
02:45:37,970 --> 02:45:41,390
I didn't believe Mike. You got it. You
had that wrong. They don't do that, dude.

2934
02:45:41,750 --> 02:45:44,240
I was convinced and then you
looked it up and I looked it up.

2935
02:45:44,360 --> 02:45:47,900
It was save them a dollar
a car. Oh, dollar car.

2936
02:45:48,230 --> 02:45:49,790
And they're willing to
risk someone else's life.

2937
02:45:50,220 --> 02:45:52,160
Dollar car would cost them a dollar car,

2938
02:45:52,161 --> 02:45:54,620
so it saved them a dollar
per car to let this happen.

2939
02:45:56,730 --> 02:45:58,740
I'm telling you, man, it's like
you think you're better than that.

2940
02:45:58,741 --> 02:46:02,190
But it's like organizations when
they go on check, floods become that.

2941
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:07,320
Those become that horrible thing.
You need repercussions kind of car.

2942
02:46:07,321 --> 02:46:10,820
Do you drive? All right.
No, no. Tell people no, no.

2943
02:46:10,821 --> 02:46:13,940
And it was a Honda for a long
time. You're free now, right?

2944
02:46:13,970 --> 02:46:18,190
Three of them run around shit over at
some Bartman and CCS cards that a foreign

2945
02:46:18,200 --> 02:46:20,990
rent is easiest cry. That's a good
friend. What's he bar? It's fucking car.

2946
02:46:21,720 --> 02:46:24,140
He's got a second one here for
his wife and his wife's not here.

2947
02:46:24,790 --> 02:46:29,390
You've been lifting. Let
me see. Uber's Great Uber.

2948
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:34,070
Uber's Great Uber. To me, it's a perfect
example of why the free market exists.

2949
02:46:34,310 --> 02:46:37,880
Where it's like cabs are assholes.
They don't pick up black people.

2950
02:46:38,060 --> 02:46:41,360
They fucking yell at you and may demand
that you pay fucking cash instead of

2951
02:46:41,361 --> 02:46:44,270
credit card, even though that's
not the rules. They just smell.

2952
02:46:44,271 --> 02:46:47,240
And then you're like, well guess what
a new organization pops up from that.

2953
02:46:48,220 --> 02:46:50,840
Shut it down time. Those guys,
you have downtime in between gigs.

2954
02:46:50,841 --> 02:46:54,530
Sometimes the limo drivers.
That's why Uber works so well.

2955
02:46:54,680 --> 02:46:57,250
And then there's Uber x which
uses like Prius's. Yeah,

2956
02:46:57,320 --> 02:46:59,470
and can you take people
around and presents the best?

2957
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:03,800
Uber x is just comedians
have a job to do that.

2958
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:08,360
How do you work for Uber x? Turn on the
APP and whenever you get you signed up,

2959
02:47:08,370 --> 02:47:10,650
whenever you're ready to go, ready
to work. And then here's what it is.

2960
02:47:10,651 --> 02:47:13,460
I asked them, what's do you have
to get checked out? They register.

2961
02:47:13,461 --> 02:47:17,090
They know who you are. I
don't know. I know they're
not paying people's insurance.

2962
02:47:17,091 --> 02:47:18,350
I know they're not playing
their drivers insurance.

2963
02:47:18,351 --> 02:47:20,090
So if a driver crashes on that driver,

2964
02:47:20,630 --> 02:47:23,260
so that's one of those special insurance
and I think they, they've gone,

2965
02:47:23,310 --> 02:47:26,540
they realized the checks, but I don't
think they're that crazy checks.

2966
02:47:26,540 --> 02:47:30,440
Like I had talked about how I got that
somebody was going to get murdered.

2967
02:47:30,470 --> 02:47:33,140
Here's the checked. Oh yeah, maybe
that, but here's the check is the,

2968
02:47:33,141 --> 02:47:36,590
is the rating system. Yeah.
Is A, if you get bad ratings,

2969
02:47:36,591 --> 02:47:39,200
if you're like drive all over, you don't
know. I think people won't take you. Yeah.

2970
02:47:39,201 --> 02:47:41,240
I got a guy in New York who
asked me to give him a rating.

2971
02:47:41,300 --> 02:47:44,880
You asked me to rate him on
a pig. It helped me. Yeah,

2972
02:47:44,930 --> 02:47:47,330
but if you like murder and kill somebody,

2973
02:47:47,331 --> 02:47:50,300
just take their phone and give
yourself five stars. That's great.

2974
02:47:51,730 --> 02:47:53,860
That's a great point.
Then just never does a rating.

2975
02:47:53,900 --> 02:47:56,840
So he's going to fight for the
life on a password protected phone.

2976
02:47:56,930 --> 02:47:59,720
That'll be your, your demise. We
though you wouldn't know who they are.

2977
02:47:59,750 --> 02:48:01,310
You would know who they are.
They come to pick you up?

2978
02:48:01,340 --> 02:48:03,630
Only if you have an iPhone
that's new. Yeah, but no,

2979
02:48:03,650 --> 02:48:05,390
they would know in the system
they came to pick you up.

2980
02:48:05,450 --> 02:48:07,580
You don't kill the other ones.
What about the android users?

2981
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:11,960
They have the thumb prints. Now I'm
prince don't work on the android phones.

2982
02:48:12,230 --> 02:48:15,830
They don't, they don't want to start
a phone up that good one on the um,

2983
02:48:16,070 --> 02:48:19,880
the fucking big. That big
silver one. Cattle Moto X. No,

2984
02:48:19,881 --> 02:48:24,410
not the moto x was the other one.
HTC One mega or whatever it is.

2985
02:48:24,440 --> 02:48:27,860
They have fingerprints and in the back
getting off my data plan though. Ooh,

2986
02:48:27,861 --> 02:48:31,520
look at you. You're gangster. Just like
no data plan when I filed has five too.

2987
02:48:32,060 --> 02:48:35,360
Why would you do that?
Addiction. Oh, you're addicted.

2988
02:48:35,361 --> 02:48:38,130
So much time spent checking
social media and emails. I'm like,

2989
02:48:38,131 --> 02:48:41,540
I can get to that later. I'll tell you
what. I was on vacation for a few days.

2990
02:48:41,650 --> 02:48:45,170
Good. Right. You get off it occasionally.
I've got on Twitter to send out messages.

2991
02:48:45,220 --> 02:48:47,480
You know, like some
funny, I saw a picture,

2992
02:48:47,481 --> 02:48:50,660
I saw a funny saw deer walking around
and took a picture of this guy walking

2993
02:48:50,661 --> 02:48:54,770
around cause it gave zero
fucks just walking towards me.

2994
02:48:55,700 --> 02:48:58,730
And so I took a picture of him cause I
was just amazed at like there's d we're

2995
02:48:58,731 --> 02:49:01,940
so used to being around, people are just
walking around. Yeah. But other than that,

2996
02:49:02,150 --> 02:49:05,120
I didn't really go online, didn't
really read too much, just chilled,

2997
02:49:05,180 --> 02:49:08,440
relaxed feeling great. Shut your
phone off. Don't check my email

2998
02:49:08,470 --> 02:49:12,450
a little bit. Hang out with people I
see on elevators. As soon as the alert,

2999
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:14,370
everyone takes it off and
it's like no one's even,

3000
02:49:14,610 --> 02:49:17,550
not that we need to make friends
all the time, but keep your eyes up.

3001
02:49:17,551 --> 02:49:18,600
Just like both are good.

3002
02:49:19,080 --> 02:49:21,930
It's good to have a phone cause it's good
to be able to get information quickly.

3003
02:49:22,140 --> 02:49:23,580
Go to a movies,
let's find out what's playing.

3004
02:49:23,581 --> 02:49:26,130
But you have to have discipline
with that. Yeah. And if I don't,

3005
02:49:26,160 --> 02:49:29,420
then it's like I don't, I don't know
if you know, I'll tell the people,

3006
02:49:29,440 --> 02:49:32,460
look it up on your phone or if we're
to why phonology in doing that,

3007
02:49:32,490 --> 02:49:33,570
like if you look at that trend,

3008
02:49:33,690 --> 02:49:36,060
that trend of being constantly
connected to your phone,

3009
02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:39,030
being afraid to leave your phone behind.
Do you think the technology,

3010
02:49:39,060 --> 02:49:42,330
if you sort of extrapolate like where's
that going that didn't exist before?

3011
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:46,860
Like do you think that that's technologies
like drawing us in to like become

3012
02:49:46,861 --> 02:49:50,160
completely commodity
machines? Yeah. Borgess do.

3013
02:49:50,161 --> 02:49:54,900
Dunkin just got back from this virtual
reality conference and he fucking called

3014
02:49:54,901 --> 02:49:58,980
me up, tripping out, tried ripping out,

3015
02:49:59,280 --> 02:50:03,000
tripped me out on LSD. I Dunno.
He was completely just completely,

3016
02:50:03,001 --> 02:50:06,750
so I was in front of the Improv and we're,
we're talking on the phone. He goes,

3017
02:50:06,751 --> 02:50:09,840
dude, you're not going to fucking
believe this man. He goes,

3018
02:50:09,870 --> 02:50:12,570
this is bigger than the
invention of the camera.

3019
02:50:12,630 --> 02:50:15,990
This is bigger than the invention
of the Internet. He goes,

3020
02:50:16,170 --> 02:50:18,870
you go into a room and there's
a man in the room playing piano.

3021
02:50:18,871 --> 02:50:20,820
You have these virtual
reality reality goggles on.

3022
02:50:21,150 --> 02:50:25,350
You put them on and he goes and it's
almost indistinguishable. He goes,

3023
02:50:25,351 --> 02:50:27,000
you're watching a movie.
He goes,

3024
02:50:27,001 --> 02:50:30,270
it's age D and it's a film and it's
playing out in front of you in three

3025
02:50:30,271 --> 02:50:30,780
dimensions.

3026
02:50:30,780 --> 02:50:35,010
The way they make this film is they put
cameras all over a person's body and

3027
02:50:35,011 --> 02:50:39,570
then they, they film as this guy's
walking around, so as you move this,

3028
02:50:39,840 --> 02:50:41,550
this headset that you're wearing,

3029
02:50:41,670 --> 02:50:45,150
it picks up all the appropriate angles
from all the different cameras and it's

3030
02:50:45,151 --> 02:50:48,940
seamless. He said the first one, if you
got that oculus rift, the first one,

3031
02:50:49,090 --> 02:50:51,970
I played that at his place,
very pixelated, but it's
still fascinating, right?

3032
02:50:52,520 --> 02:50:57,270
Nauseous. That's gone. He
said, that's gone. He said,

3033
02:50:57,390 --> 02:50:59,240
I'll make sure you still
show that on a book,

3034
02:50:59,310 --> 02:51:02,160
but like a new prescription on my glasses
that you get nauseous for like half a

3035
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:06,390
day. Those people are called
to fucking the changes here,

3036
02:51:07,020 --> 02:51:11,100
but Don Duncan was a freaking the fuck
out. It didn't give me nausea. It kind of,

3037
02:51:11,101 --> 02:51:14,130
I could see where it would happen.
Doug Benson, it made him sick, I think.

3038
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:16,830
I don't know if you get
sick when you read in a car.

3039
02:51:16,860 --> 02:51:19,110
That's what I get really
sad when I read in a car,

3040
02:51:19,111 --> 02:51:20,850
I've gotten like where I've
rolled down the window, I'm like,

3041
02:51:20,851 --> 02:51:25,110
I'm not going to make it fresh air.
Well, I'm like, I am going to fucking,

3042
02:51:25,111 --> 02:51:26,490
I can't swallow quick enough.

3043
02:51:26,550 --> 02:51:29,250
Especially if it's a curvy road because
you don't know where the turns are

3044
02:51:29,251 --> 02:51:32,520
coming. So it's like it goes
against where, where you
know what? It's going to me,

3045
02:51:32,521 --> 02:51:36,090
it's just reading. It's just, it does
not even, they don't have to be curvy.

3046
02:51:36,180 --> 02:51:40,050
If I'm reading a car, if I try to read
a book or a newspaper and a car, I get,

3047
02:51:40,170 --> 02:51:41,880
I get sick,
but nothing.

3048
02:51:41,881 --> 02:51:45,780
That's the only time you get
on a bus or train easier.

3049
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:50,850
I got sick flying in an FAA 18 flew with
the blue angels. I tried super hard,

3050
02:51:50,851 --> 02:51:53,750
but I got sick at the end. He barfed
we'll do a little puke and when did,

3051
02:51:53,880 --> 02:51:57,720
when did it, what's, what's the term? I
got sick to me. BARF. What did that, yeah,

3052
02:51:57,721 --> 02:52:00,240
I know, right? I didn't ever hear it
like that. And then I heard it and like,

3053
02:52:00,420 --> 02:52:03,360
and like books that way. How about
the term? I've got my eye on you.

3054
02:52:04,500 --> 02:52:05,680
I had my on her,

3055
02:52:06,520 --> 02:52:11,320
like she had her eye on you. Yeah.
She's got her eye on you. You know,

3056
02:52:11,321 --> 02:52:13,960
like if a girl's got the hots for you,
Hey Ari, she's got her eye on you.

3057
02:52:14,230 --> 02:52:18,280
She's looking at you. But it was that
fucking some ancient fucking evil shit.

3058
02:52:18,730 --> 02:52:21,500
Throw your honor. She
has her eye on, you know,

3059
02:52:21,670 --> 02:52:25,160
spell back when people talked
really weird, you know? Yeah.

3060
02:52:25,330 --> 02:52:27,350
I think that the only thing
that's lacking in, in,

3061
02:52:27,360 --> 02:52:31,390
in cell phones and stuff is the, it hasn't
gotten caught up by the etiquette yet.

3062
02:52:32,230 --> 02:52:34,410
You know, it's, people are now starting
to be like, hey, it's dinner. Put the,

3063
02:52:34,411 --> 02:52:35,170
put your phone away.

3064
02:52:35,170 --> 02:52:38,200
That is nice when people
do that and people are also
starting to really get into

3065
02:52:38,410 --> 02:52:40,600
retro shit.
Like think about that.

3066
02:52:40,930 --> 02:52:43,600
People are really into
like record players now.

3067
02:52:43,690 --> 02:52:45,610
And a lot of people were into old cars.

3068
02:52:45,670 --> 02:52:48,540
Three more minutes where I'm going to
turn into a pumpkin and realize, oh,

3069
02:52:48,550 --> 02:52:51,430
I got to tell you this thing. Oh
Shit. Tell a quick. So it's Shanghai.

3070
02:52:51,431 --> 02:52:54,430
They have these noodles and street
noodles. It was off the street meat,

3071
02:52:54,431 --> 02:52:57,700
which is delicious. There's expo say,
which I did not eat any street noodles.

3072
02:52:57,810 --> 02:53:01,140
This is the way they got their oil to
cook the noodles. They would. Brian,

3073
