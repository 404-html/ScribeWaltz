1
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,540
Take it.

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,530
Your head will explode.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,920
So he's only got a little bit left.

4
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:20,360
How much time do you
think Charlie has left?

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,770
Oh man,

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,060
this can't last long.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,660
He's,

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,060
he's throwing napalm on that candle.

9
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:27,530
He's not burning at both ends.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:28,391
Well,

11
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:29,980
I think it's almost like he,

12
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:30,611
he's sick.

13
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:33,640
Like he's dying and he knows it and
so he decided to go out with a bang.

14
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,040
Well,

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,380
you know,

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:34,600
doctor,

17
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,200
you mysterious terminal illness.

18
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,800
It's called,

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,240
I like coke illness,

20
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,260
but maybe that's what he's doing.

21
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:40,890
I don't know.

22
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,560
I mean,

23
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:41,840
yeah,

24
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,651
he's a pretty fucked up.

25
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:43,484
It's cold.

26
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,840
There's girls are talking
about him doing it,

27
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,670
have briefcases of coke delivered.

28
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,481
That's not some shit.

29
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,850
You just get over hanging out by the pool,

30
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,510
you know,

31
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,071
Drinking Margarita.

32
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:53,760
So he's still getting drunk all the time.

33
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:54,571
He drinks his drinks,

34
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:57,300
whiskey or vodka on his show on that show.

35
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:58,260
He's got like a bottle with him.

36
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:59,010
He was trying to hide it.

37
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,610
Yeah.

38
00:00:59,610 --> 00:00:59,731
It's,

39
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:00,564
you're not paying,

40
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,440
they're not paying you enough,

41
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:02,960
Charlie.

42
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,793
Shane,

43
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,611
you should hang it.

44
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:06,260
Or $1 million per show.

45
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,160
It's weird how other
people reacting to them.

46
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,990
Like Roger Ebert got Pissy with them.

47
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:10,530
Did you see that?

48
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,810
No one actually ever in Charlie's.

49
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:14,160
She ain't got in a Twitter
war and it was like,

50
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,941
I wish I,

51
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:15,241
you know,

52
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,680
I could live like Charlie Sheen,

53
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:20,640
but then my wife would leave me and I
don't want to be alone and miserable like

54
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:20,911
him.

55
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:21,270
I'm like,

56
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,751
whoa.

57
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:22,890
The claws come out,

58
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,070
Roger Ebert to loan.

59
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:25,904
You've got all this.

60
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,110
Why is Roger Ebert even talking like that
about Charlie Sheen that I could live

61
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:31,620
like that.

62
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,041
First of all,

63
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:32,490
dude,

64
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,031
no you couldn't.

65
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:33,811
You can't even talk.

66
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:34,890
He doesn't have a tongue anymore.

67
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,350
Right,

68
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,521
right.

69
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:36,061
Roger Ebert,

70
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:36,894
Hud's mouth cancers.

71
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,480
John isn't working where you
would think that would be the,

72
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,670
the least of his worries would
be what Charlie Sheen is doing.

73
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,730
You know?

74
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,770
That's so bizarre.

75
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,000
That would even comment on that.

76
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,760
And then Charlie Sheen responded
back and was something about,

77
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,520
you know,

78
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,210
you've never had five
girls at a time winning,

79
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,200
winning,

80
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,033
earn it.

81
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,680
Five girls at a time plan better.

82
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,420
That's not 11 is it?

83
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:57,931
No,

84
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:59,760
it's not like a lot.

85
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:00,880
Mostly

86
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,460
he must be like really lazy because if
you are having sex with that many people

87
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:07,230
you just kind of stay still
and let it like come around.

88
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,480
A friend of mine told me about when
he first started making money and uh,

89
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,090
he's a famous gentleman so I can't say
his name but he got two hookers at the

90
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:17,780
same time and he laid in
bed and just see her man.

91
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,301
Oops.

92
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,134
I almost did his voice.

93
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,213
He's like,

94
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,240
you haven't lived until you've had all
these women like tongs just licking your

95
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:26,184
body.

96
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,731
I think it was,

97
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:26,881
yeah,

98
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,970
it's was like it's impossible to not
freak out like it was like too much.

99
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,590
I was getting too much stimulation.

100
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,730
Wow.

101
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,250
I've had two and it was kind
of interesting but it was
more like you were at the

102
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:35,491
top.

103
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:36,540
I worked the bottom type thing.

104
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,170
I could imagine like the middle
part also that seems awesome.

105
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,060
Male feminists

106
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,650
give funny is that idea male feminists
and you're going to defend that nonsense

107
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,250
person.

108
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,310
You could just kidding.

109
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,960
It makes me angry.

110
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,750
Joe Rogan experience
podcast is how we do it.

111
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,860
This is backstage flowering.

112
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,390
Yes.

113
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,020
This is the dog,

114
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,680
the pts,

115
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,560
Brian Dog.

116
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,530
She's the sweetest,

117
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,350
most affectionate little
dogs probably ever existed.

118
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,530
She needs affection every second
of every minute of every hour.

119
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,180
Is that normal for dogs
that have this cow spots?

120
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,840
Yeah,

121
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,673
totally.

122
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,300
Are you a part cow?

123
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,111
Where's your belly button?

124
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:15,944
Right there.

125
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,700
I also,

126
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,860
I say fascinating
podcasts with young Andy.

127
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:25,130
Dick is the first time Andy and I have
seen each other in a couple of years,

128
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:25,610
years.

129
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,920
That was a lot of fun and
we got a lot out of the way.

130
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,420
A lot of talking about the old days.

131
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,470
A lot of bizarre shit.

132
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,700
Last sexual tension.

133
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:31,880
Yeah,

134
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,713
a lot of weirdness.

135
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,640
We talked about pretty much everything.

136
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,590
I'm having a little
sexual tension with Hubby.

137
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,230
The other thing I didn't
tell you about why I,

138
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,350
I'm sober again.

139
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,170
I got real sick like I
thought I was going to die.

140
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,180
I got to a place where like I'd
rather be dead at this point.

141
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,630
I feel that they was just from drinking.

142
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,750
My immune system went away and I got like
pneumonia and at my age at 45 you can,

143
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,110
you can die from.

144
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,800
That's how Rick James died.

145
00:03:59,130 --> 00:03:59,963
That's how ammonia,

146
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,260
yeah,

147
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,970
so did Geraldo.

148
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,570
Greg,

149
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,403
Geraldo,

150
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,250
well,

151
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,530
your immune system goes down.

152
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,351
He went into a coma,

153
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:07,730
then he got pneumonia and die.

154
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,270
Really pneumonia is because
a lot of fucking people,

155
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,710
people get aids.

156
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,560
It's an acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.

157
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:18,320
It's your immune system goes away
and they usually die from pneumonia.

158
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,251
They don't,

159
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:19,580
you don't,

160
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,960
you're not dying from AIDS.

161
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,500
You get aids and then
you die from the mode.

162
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,660
And I'm just telling you I'm not,

163
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,200
I don't plan on drinking again.

164
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,080
Well you say quite a while,

165
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:31,190
you leave the door open though.

166
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,270
You know you were,

167
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,570
you,

168
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,560
you're leaving the door open.

169
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:33,840
See,

170
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,600
this is what I just don't
want to lie to myself.

171
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,230
I understand.

172
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,771
You know what I mean?

173
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:37,521
You don't have to,

174
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:39,440
you can promise yourself
and then keep a promise.

175
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,160
But you know,

176
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,911
this is the thing,

177
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:41,311
like when,

178
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:41,900
when people talk,

179
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,010
how about like you want to show with you,

180
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,550
you know,

181
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,540
and you say stuff like that.

182
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,070
They worry about Charlie,

183
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,420
she was sober for a long time.

184
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,111
What are you making?

185
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:51,110
2 million a week and it just fucking
keeps coming in and you've got to stop

186
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:53,660
pulling off and you've got a lot of balls
because everybody's kissing your ass

187
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,370
cause you come to the set
and they all rely on you.

188
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,290
You're the fucking rock star from Mars.

189
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,071
And now the next thing,

190
00:04:58,071 --> 00:04:59,270
but if I'm doing a show with you,

191
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,650
no way he's going to be kissing,

192
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,900
but let us be screaming at me every day.

193
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,501
No,

194
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:04,640
you're right.

195
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,310
You're going to get an a go grad.

196
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,153
Have more

197
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,013
fucking dog

198
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,700
out to show you the super sophisticated
death squad podcast studios.

199
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,180
This is podcast studio number.

200
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:20,270
Yeah,

201
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,060
to podcasts.

202
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,620
Podcast to

203
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,250
Brian offers you to touch this.

204
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:29,084
The closest one.

205
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,721
Don't do it.

206
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:31,610
This is the one he's
been fucking for years.

207
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,660
It's covered in dirt and
dog hair and cat litter.

208
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,461
This is the studio.

209
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:38,450
This is where it all goes down.

210
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,940
This is the computer that Brian Works at.

211
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Home Monitor set up.

212
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,720
And this is where Andy Dick Sat.

213
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:45,740
If you want to snip the seat,

214
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,360
this is what their satellite,

215
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:50,590
this is our satellite studio.

216
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:51,371
So when we're not doing it,

217
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:51,490
yeah,

218
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,990
my place to do it right here.

219
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,220
We're here with Al Magical of course,

220
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:59,720
Alan Opera partaking in this.

221
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,763
This is a,

222
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,970
this is a funny cigarette.

223
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,510
Uh,

224
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,343
that's all it is.

225
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,950
Preparation for the show you
to fire up the synapsis out.

226
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:07,341
Magical.

227
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:08,210
You fired up for the show too.

228
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,430
I am just excited.

229
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,270
It's going to be,

230
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,690
it's already packed inside and uh,

231
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,420
it's incredible when you get to go out
in front of Joe's audience because it's

232
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,110
real comedy fans and uh,

233
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,163
it's exciting.

234
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,723
You got a gun.

235
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,350
We almost lost everything their folks.

236
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,490
Uh,

237
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,400
it fell but only a small camera light.

238
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,480
Is that what it is that
you're sitting here?

239
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,280
It's like 10 to 10 buck on stage.

240
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,230
I'll mash bills onstage right now.

241
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,080
This is the world famous
comedy and Magic Club,

242
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,861
the most of the beach,

243
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:42,620
California.

244
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,910
So one of the most historic
comedy clubs in the country.

245
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,990
There's this writing on this
wall from 1978 and look at that.

246
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,220
That's like the earliest,

247
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:52,900
I think people have found a 78.

248
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,740
This is like a real classic,

249
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,040
Classic Comedy Club.

250
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,220
Jay Leno comes here every Sunday
and works is monologues ash.

251
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,410
And we're just sitting here freaking
out at about how crazy it is that,

252
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:11,020
uh,

253
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,260
we've done almost a
hundred fucking podcast.

254
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,970
It's pretty bizarre.

255
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,013
Doesn't it mean,

256
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,460
is that crazy?

257
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,310
Yeah,

258
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,143
that's a lot of,

259
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,450
if you think about that's
times two hours mostly.

260
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,350
Yeah.

261
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,660
How many hours?

262
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,890
I think what we try to do
on the podcast is we all,

263
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,910
we're all trying to have fun.

264
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,690
You know,

265
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,950
we're all hanging out together.

266
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,190
We're all talking about cool
and interesting shit and
we're trying to have fun.

267
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,310
And I think that's what a lot of fucking
people are missing in their life.

268
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,760
They're missing fun and they're
missing cool people to hang out with.

269
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,241
You know,

270
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:46,800
where everybody is enjoying
each other's company,

271
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,790
you know,

272
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,181
that's,

273
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:48,570
uh,

274
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,670
that's not present in everybody's life.

275
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,770
And with the podcast it's sorta
allows them to be on it there,

276
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,520
you know,

277
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,200
they can hang out and have these
cool two hour conversations with us.

278
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:02,340
They can't talk back,

279
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,890
but they can be there for
like a real conversation.

280
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,930
Not just wow,

281
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,870
just a show.

282
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,030
But really how you'd think about things.

283
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:09,301
Really.

284
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:10,320
How I think about things.

285
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,741
It's not,

286
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:11,130
you know,

287
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,540
sometimes it's weird like
when me and Pete Johansen,

288
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,920
you know,

289
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,850
we don't agree at all and sometimes
it's weird like Andy Dick,

290
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:19,830
he's trying to fuck me or you know,

291
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:23,020
sometimes it's weird where like when
we're talking to Adana Delmont Dana,

292
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,060
Dana Hermanns stories,

293
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,680
strangest fuck man.

294
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,870
She seems like this
really cool normal check,

295
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,471
you know?

296
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:30,390
And she's this crazy porn star,

297
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,010
but she's like really funny too.

298
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:32,881
It's a,

299
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:34,410
it's a fascinating gig.

300
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,310
You know,

301
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,080
I'm so glad that we started doing this.

302
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,681
You know,

303
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:39,210
we've been doing it over a year now,

304
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,140
just over a year.

305
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,363
And um,

306
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,110
it just started off as a goof,

307
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,550
right?

308
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,383
Remember?

309
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,300
Yeah,

310
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,920
we did.

311
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,340
You know,

312
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,370
the idea I think was when I,

313
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,350
we were always trying to
do the Justin TV thing.

314
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:53,780
I like doing like a weekly video,

315
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,640
like live from the green while
we're on the road and stuff.

316
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,743
And then we've,

317
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,420
I was always trying to like
push for that video thing.

318
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:02,370
So I think it started off when we've,

319
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,110
we didn't even think podcasts at first.

320
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,070
We were thinking of doing like a,

321
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,700
like a video show once a
week and Kumina inspired me.

322
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,070
Yeah.

323
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,470
Does that live at the compound?

324
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,333
Yeah.

325
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,200
There's so many fun guys that are smart.

326
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,400
I know when you get guys like
Dunkin and Brian Cowen and Eddie,

327
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:17,470
aft and Ari,

328
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:22,110
and there's so many dudes that would
have interesting opinions on so many

329
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:23,100
different subjects.

330
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,440
I sent the luckiest thing about the
podcast is that we get to have regular

331
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:30,530
conversations with all
these cool motherfuckers.

332
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,373
Man,

333
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,740
hasn't it made,

334
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,060
isn't it?

335
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,410
Do you think he's just improved your life?

336
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,640
How has it improved your life?

337
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,200
The podcast?

338
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,480
Yeah.

339
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,740
Oh yeah,

340
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,520
absolutely.

341
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,780
It's an improved way you think?

342
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:39,921
Yeah,

343
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:44,780
because it's finally getting like putting
my thoughts and ideas to an audience,

344
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,280
so I absolutely,

345
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,473
yeah.

346
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,910
I mean that's what I've been trying to do,

347
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:50,150
you know,

348
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,330
at least on the Internet for a long
ass time and now it's finally coming

349
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:54,164
together.

350
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,231
Hey,

351
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,064
what's up?

352
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,630
What's the best thing?

353
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,040
The best thing we've ever done?

354
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,370
It's the best thing I've for sure because
it's the only thing I've ever done to

355
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:04,260
where it's really 100% mate.

356
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,711
You know?

357
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:07,990
You kind of like get to know who the fuck
somebody is when you watched them in a

358
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,100
standup routine or when you
see them act or you know,

359
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:12,870
maybe when you see him do some interviews,

360
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,430
but interviews are fucking quick,

361
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:14,830
man.

362
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,660
They're overbuilt.

363
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,580
You don't even know what the
fuck you were supposed to say.

364
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,840
It feel weird when you
leave like every time zone,

365
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,570
like a tonight show interview
or one of those things,

366
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:21,990
man,

367
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,610
you sit down in the chair
next to Jay went out.

368
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,530
I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

369
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,970
I'm just trying to be funny.

370
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,790
I only have like seven minutes and
I'm just trying to keep it together.

371
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,663
Hey,

372
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,613
hey,

373
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:32,630
hey,

374
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,610
Nate are

375
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,240
anyway.

376
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,500
But with the podcast,

377
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:40,831
when you're,

378
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:42,780
when you're on for like two hours,

379
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:43,380
man,

380
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:43,651
you know,

381
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:45,270
you really get a chance
to talk to somebody.

382
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:46,500
You know exactly what though?

383
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,740
Like now people understand
the brilliance of Dunkin.

384
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,760
You know,

385
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,530
Dunkin is really good dude.

386
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:54,300
He's a fascinating motherfucker.

387
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:54,690
You know,

388
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,080
but it's really gets illustrated
on the podcasts and Brian Cowen,

389
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,290
there's a lot of people who
have no idea how smart Brian is.

390
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,430
What?

391
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,220
No idea of funny Joey fucking Diaz.

392
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:02,420
Yep.

393
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,500
That's what I think is the
best thing because like,

394
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:04,790
like,

395
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,190
like what you're talking about like,

396
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:08,090
and with the death squad,

397
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:12,110
I get to put a fucking these people out
of nowhere that no one would ever know

398
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:12,560
about,

399
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,800
at least to an audiences.

400
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:13,930
That's a

401
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,763
brilliant idea.

402
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,210
You,

403
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,230
you've created a radio station
in desk qualms radio station.

404
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:19,760
We're going to use this
as a video commercial.

405
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,880
It's brilliant idea.

406
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:21,641
And Brian Red band,

407
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:22,580
he's a fucking genius.

408
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,271
A mastermind.

409
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:24,950
He saw a head he saw into the future,

410
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,560
created a con damn broad band,

411
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,830
Internet radio network
type thing of podcasts.

412
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,330
You can't fuck with that.

413
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,620
You can't fuck one time.

414
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,930
Let me try to fuck with that.

415
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,070
I can't fuck with it.

416
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,053
You figured it out.

417
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,133
Crack the code.

418
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,153
He hack the system.

419
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,620
Top 20 on iTunes and what's up with that?

420
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,290
Talk to him to some
fucking dude from Columbus,

421
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,124
Ohio,

422
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,870
making people touch is dirty flashlight,

423
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,040
sick.

424
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,873
Fuck.

425
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,471
All right.

426
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,010
That's it.

427
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,843
Show's over.

428
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,870
That's a vagina.

429
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,600
Put your finger on it.

430
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:56,930
It's,

431
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,860
yeah,

432
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,900
it hasn't been washed.

433
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,420
One of my first gigs ever was
a little rider car show and,

434
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:04,610
uh,

435
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,370
they were going to have a bikini contest.

436
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,270
So to me,

437
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,570
and like three other comics and
the bikini girls don't show up.

438
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,500
So all these Latino dudes and oversized
white tee shirts with video cameras are

439
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,870
standing there waiting
for this bikini contest.

440
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,951
It never happens.

441
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:18,371
And they say,

442
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:18,521
well,

443
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,170
now instead of the Bikini contest,

444
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:21,080
we're gonna have the Comedians,

445
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,790
every moon walk away.

446
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,290
And then the crowd does for us to go.

447
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:26,831
And,

448
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:27,160
uh,

449
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,730
I look out in the middle of the
audience as I'm starting up,

450
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,050
and there's a little boy
holding his parents' hands,

451
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,510
uh,

452
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,291
just going like this,

453
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:35,891
looking at me,

454
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:36,760
flipping me off.

455
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,680
You just holding it,

456
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,940
not even moving.

457
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,110
He didn't flinch it off.

458
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,210
You just held it my entire sec.

459
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,730
I just looked at me and that's all
I could think about is this kid.

460
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,640
And so as I was doing,

461
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:48,911
I said,

462
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:49,210
it was like,

463
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,350
this is horrible.

464
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:54,610
So anytime I go up and I don't
see anybody paying attention,

465
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:54,931
you know,

466
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:56,550
we were talking about that's not into it.

467
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,220
Right.

468
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,260
I just think of that
little kid blew me off.

469
00:12:59,290 --> 00:12:59,561
I was like,

470
00:12:59,561 --> 00:12:59,741
yeah,

471
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:00,574
you're right.

472
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,530
Just having done that.

473
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,403
Okay.

474
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,870
[inaudible]

475
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,453
can we take pictures?

476
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:34,963
No,

477
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:37,460
no.

478
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,540
This is a perfect night.

479
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,523
Take a bunch.

480
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,440
Well,

481
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,180
I'll think about it.

482
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,230
Just keeps snapping them.

483
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,320
Number one right here.

484
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:45,090
It's going.

485
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,923
That's going.

486
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,993
Alright.

487
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,631
One more.

488
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:48,464
One more.

489
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,403
There it goes.

490
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,120
Good night.

491
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,880
Thank you.

492
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,713
Take care guys.

493
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,613
Right,

494
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,023
right.

495
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:24,570
Yeah.
