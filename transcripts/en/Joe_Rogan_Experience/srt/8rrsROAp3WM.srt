1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,410
The general good experience in,
they always have those kinds of things.

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:08,050
There's all sorts of different classes
that you like

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,200
is awesome.
I've done one of those high intensity

4
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:15,870
interval training things at a yoga place
to do.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,330
You do some yoga and some like really
light weights,

6
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:21,290
but all these crazy little exercises.
That's fun too.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,060
We got a good dancer pose.
Got a dancer pose.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,050
Yeah.
Wait,

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,050
let me see.
He's A.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,621
Oh,
you try to do that.

11
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:33,420
Don't hurt yourself.
Yes.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,010
Oh,
that is that what it's called?

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,240
Standing Bow.
Good things called standing bow and

14
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:42,010
there's this one.
Keep it going.

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,630
Are you going?
No one can see you.

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,660
You're supposed to grab both legs,
but that's okay.

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,710
Grab that other leg,
but she got it.

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,310
Nope.
Come on son.

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,160
Here he goes.
Nice.

20
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,210
And the headphones on.
Take it to the new level.

21
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,380
It's like a NASA mission called again,
a cry for help.

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,080
I call it the crab.

23
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,950
When you say you do yoga,
like how often do you do it?

24
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,960
When I would go,
I would go to hot yoga.

25
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:17,080
You go a couple times a week are now.
I just kind of do it in my backyard to

26
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:19,090
stretch out after a long flight or
something.

27
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,320
That's good.
Anything you had the tank like that's a

28
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:25,470
time to think about life,
to think through it.

29
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,730
Think through a mission that you're
working on.

30
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:30,330
Some family issue.
It's like quiet your.

31
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,110
It's about you.
For me,

32
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:34,210
Yoga,
it's like giving yourself a massage.

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,520
It's more gratifying than going to

34
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,610
can get real weights and stuff.
I like to stretch out before sets.

35
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:42,880
You ever do that?
Do stretches before we go do this.

36
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,620
It feels real good that like there's
something about that that's very

37
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:47,240
relaxing.
Puts you in a good.

38
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,550
I think you carry around when you're
tight,

39
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,270
you carry around a lot of tension that
you don't necessarily want.

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,810
Pigeon pose.
That's where all the tension is.

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,400
Pigeon pose.
That's the one

42
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,270
where your.
Where your leg comes under your.

43
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,390
I want to ask Joe,
what the fuck is he doing?

44
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,650
Oh Wow.
Jeff,

45
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,181
that.
Oh,

46
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:08,510
I've seen this one.
Yeah,

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,350
I've seen that one.
That's called a hip opener.

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,593
Good hips,
Bro.

49
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,300
That looks so sad.

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,340
One like if you go to hot yoga and
people will do that pose and start

51
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:25,710
crying because there's so much emotion
and anxiety release from the hitch,

52
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,370
that's not real.
You're just crying because someone told

53
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:29,204
you you should cry.

54
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,060
You want to be a part of the group cry
nonsense.

55
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,580
They always want to say that this is
opening up your colon.

56
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:40,090
You don't have any fucking.
There's no diagrams.

57
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,520
You don't know where the colon is like,
you better stop.

58
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,840
I Dunno when I fight,
it's like I'm fighting and yeah,

59
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,530
it's a poor shield in a sense,
you know?

60
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,150
And uh,
sometimes if it hurts enough,

61
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:56,190
like when I got my ribs cracked,
I felt that right.

62
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,070
I can went through and I like disrupted
my for shield and so sometimes that's

63
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,850
something we'll go through,
like a good solid or shield four.

64
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,860
Shields will activate your attitude.
Your mindset is like you're fighting,

65
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,480
you're,
you're ready to accept all sorts of

66
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,220
things.
Yeah.

67
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,640
Like I could die
or even harder.

68
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,700
I could kill someone.
You think it'd be harder to kill someone

69
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:22,030
than to die and so her on you?
Yeah.

70
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,070
Yeah.
Because then you think about their loved

71
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:28,390
ones,
so thinking about all the people that

72
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,230
loved you,
we fight.

73
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,790
Think about all the people that love
you.

74
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,950
Right?
And so when we fight,

75
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,100
I didn't,
I didn't break any rules,

76
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,090
but I killed you.
Right?

77
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,530
Think about all your loved ones.
Everybody that loves you that's attached

78
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:43,090
to you.
Think about that.

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,873
All that pain

80
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,360
because of what I did.
The you right.

81
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,870
Even though I didn't break any rules,
have you ever been in a promotion where

82
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:56,440
someone died?
But that's heavy,

83
00:03:56,441 --> 00:04:01,441
right?
I think probably why a lot of fighters I

84
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,750
have noticed like there's,
there's,

85
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,060
I don't think the majority of fighters a
look at what they do with the gravity

86
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,830
that,
that it deserves.

87
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,350
You know,
like you could kill somebody,

88
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,560
like you need to think about that and be
okay with that.

89
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,660
Not Okay,
but just understand like,

90
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,930
all right,
that could happen and I'm going to be

91
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:26,830
calm,
calm,

92
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:29,920
consciously knowing this and choosing to
go forward.

93
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,451
They just think,
oh,

94
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:32,440
I'm going to fight.
It'll be fun.

95
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,580
It'll know whatever.
Or it'll be harder.

96
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,360
I'm gonna like whatever.
They don't think about these things.

97
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,400
Is this something that you thought about
when you were young?

98
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,860
Yeah.
Before I really got into it.

99
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,800
So you,
this is something you've been

100
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:47,680
contemplating even before you started
fighting,

101
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:50,710
you were aware of all the possibilities?
Yeah,

102
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,070
I.
Okay.

103
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,403
All right.
I'll say it.

104
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,750
So I was um,
it was uh,

105
00:04:56,751 --> 00:05:01,751
about 28 I think and I don't think I had
my pro boxing debut yet and I took some

106
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:09,331
mushrooms and I was thinking somewhere
along the trip I started thinking about

107
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,590
fighting and I started thinking about
like what could happen to me and I think

108
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,330
it's thinking about the death of me.
And then I started thinking about what

109
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:21,550
could happen with my opponent,
like what's worse than that?

110
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,110
And I thought about I could see somebody
I fight and I saw all the,

111
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,830
like,
like lines of gold thread attached into

112
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,200
them,
like a from their loved ones.

113
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,100
And then all the lines got snipped when
they died.

114
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,080
Yeah.
I saw this on this mushroom trip and I

115
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:39,500
was just like,
fuck.

116
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,830
And so then when I decided to fight,
there's more intense,

117
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,290
you know,
and more commitment and more resolve.

118
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,380
That's heavy.
Yeah.

119
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,290
Yeah.
But that is what it is.

120
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,710
Right?
And that's where I think real,

121
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,460
there's more power.

122
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,780
This idea of a enforced equality,
right?

123
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,820
Ensuring that there is such a high
emphasis played or placed on equality,

124
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,850
equality,
that you have the equal amount of men,

125
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,010
the equal amount of women and the
opportunities are absolutely available

126
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,080
as much to women as they are to men.
This is enforced that this creates an

127
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:20,240
environment where there's less
resistance.

128
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,270
Now in an environment where there's less
resistance,

129
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:26,270
perhaps women don't feel as compelled to
say,

130
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:29,410
I'll show you that.
That is what seems to happen.

131
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,050
This is the key.
Look,

132
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,090
here's an example.
So there are fewer women mathematicians

133
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,890
in the,
in the higher echelons.

134
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:39,500
Okay?
But here's something interesting about

135
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,390
mathematical ability.
First of all,

136
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:43,400
it's very rare.
So that's the first thing to keep in

137
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,100
mind.
Now it looks like if you look in junior

138
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:51,101
high that give mathematically gifted men
and males and females are approximately

139
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:52,550
as common.

140
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,880
Now there's a little bit of debate about
that because there is some evidence that

141
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:59,600
maybe at the very upper extremes there's
a male advantage just like there's a

142
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:03,650
male disadvantage at the low end because
the mail distribution for intelligence

143
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:08,570
might be flatter and so that's the
greater male variability hypothesis.

144
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,500
There's been papers putting that forward
that had been retracted as a consequence

145
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:14,240
of pressure from politically correct
people.

146
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,770
Even though greater male variability is
actually quite common in the animal

147
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,530
kingdom for a variety of reasons.
Men are more expendable,

148
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,450
that males are more expendable in some
ways,

149
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,980
or you could say that males are more
likely to produce to pursue high risk,

150
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,620
high return strategies.
You can look at it either way and it's

151
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:32,390
certainly possible.
In any case,

152
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,810
the men,
the males in junior high who happened to

153
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:39,710
be mathematically gifted,
are less likely to also be verbally

154
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:40,544
gifted.

155
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,580
Whereas that doesn't seem to be the case
for the females.

156
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,820
And so if you're a male math nerd,
then math is pretty logical pathway for

157
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,250
you because you don't have as many other
options.

158
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:55,610
Whereas if you're female math nerd,
you have other options because you're,

159
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,330
you're less likely,
you're more likely to also be verbally

160
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:01,910
gifted,
and so that's enough to at least in

161
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:05,720
principle account for some of the reason
why there are fewer women mathematicians

162
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:07,010
than men.
Mathematicians.

163
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,860
They have other options.
They have other options and there's lots

164
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:13,130
of complex.
There's lots of complex reasons like

165
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:15,830
this,
and so we have this reflects of idea and

166
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:20,450
this is very much the case because this
is like the core idea among the feminist

167
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,620
neo Marxist types is that if there's
differences in outcome,

168
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,880
that's that's proof of prejudice and
that support for the idea of the

169
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:34,400
patriarchal tyranny and that's like the
core axiom of the radical left is the

170
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:36,380
patriarchal tyranny as far as I'm
concerned.

171
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,620
That's God for them to patriarchal
tyranny.

172
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,753
It's like,
well,

173
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,360
if it turns out that many of these
differences in outcome between men and

174
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:46,850
women aren't a consequence of the
patriarchal tyranny,

175
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,710
in fact,
even get bigger.

176
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,730
When you reduce the tear radical aspect
of the patriarch and even the

177
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:57,731
patriarchal aspect to it,
then it makes that theory not only wrong

178
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,240
but opposite of the truth,
which is the worst kind of wrong and so

179
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,000
you know,
if men are more likely to produce per

180
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,600
pursue careers in the stem fields,
which seems to be the case under

181
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:12,120
conditions of optimal freedom for men
and women,

182
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,510
then that's going to drive income
disparities because the stem fields pay

183
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:18,330
more and they pay more.
Partly because they're scalable,

184
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,540
like it's really hard to scale care for
people.

185
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,280
You know,
like if you work in a daycare,

186
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:24,660
you're going to care for three infants.

187
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,910
You're not going to care for 50 because
you can't.

188
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:29,940
It's not scalable.
But if you're like a software designer,

189
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:32,220
it's infinitely scalable.
And so there's,

190
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,280
there's a much wider range of possible
of possibility for generating much

191
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:42,390
larger,
much larger income pools and much larger

192
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:43,720
pools of wealth.
You know,

193
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:45,930
and men are also more likely to work
longer hours.

194
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:49,290
And if you work 10 percent longer hours,
you make 40 percent more money.

195
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,080
There's a nonlinear return on.
That's good thing for everybody who's

196
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:55,740
listening to know if you have a job,
you want to be the guy or the woman

197
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,030
who's working that extra 10 percent
because the return on that is nonlinear,

198
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,770
so that's a really useful thing to know

199
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,220
and I don't know how it got
distinguished,

200
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:10,221
were proud boys became this evil group
of people and an Antifa is the good

201
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,320
group of people.
Now I understand that.

202
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,590
Proud boy,
proud boys were infiltrated by white

203
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,570
nationalist,
Nazi,

204
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,310
White Supremacist,
whatever it is,

205
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:23,250
but those were constantly being
disavowed by Gavin.

206
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:26,950
Gavin never wanted any of that happen,
but is there a way.

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,090
How do you get in though?
Here's the question because this is my.

208
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:32,220
You saw my last comedy special
[inaudible].

209
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:37,260
This is my criticism of a vegans is not
that there's anything wrong with being a

210
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:40,770
Vegan is that when you have a group
where anybody can join,

211
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,470
you're going to get a certain amount of
fucking idiots,

212
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,110
right?
If you have a million people for sure

213
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:50,520
you have 100,000 fucking idiot.
He has no getting around that.

214
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,710
Yeah,
so if you have a group where anybody can

215
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:55,110
join and you have a million people in
that group,

216
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,360
you're going to have 100,000 fucking
fucking idiots.

217
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,150
Those people are going to define your
group.

218
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:03,780
The worst behavior in the group is where
people are going to call too as an

219
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:04,800
example.
That's it.

220
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,160
I think this is also a symptom of the
social media era today,

221
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:12,030
especially with twitter because you
can't express yourself and explain

222
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:16,290
things in 140 or 280 characters.
It just takes too much time so they can

223
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:16,980
say,
oh,

224
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,670
proud boys,
racist scumbag Nazi Gavin,

225
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
and they'll always a racist scumbag
Nazi.

226
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,140
Then all of a sudden that's the
narrative and everybody keeps pushing

227
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,960
it.
Videos of people punching little skinny

228
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:28,561
people.
Oh,

229
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:30,240
look at these people.
They beat up the Antifa,

230
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,390
these fucking assholes,
and Gavin's an asshole.

231
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,380
Yeah,
that's.

232
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,640
That's what it comes down to.
I've seen it presented a.

233
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,440
well.
You ask how it starts and how it grows

234
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:43,470
and how you become a member by buying a
fucking shirt.

235
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,370
That's by buying a Perry Ellis shirt and
opening a chapter two.

236
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:50,370
There are chapters worldwide,
you see it.

237
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:52,650
It's like,
here's the the proud boys,

238
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,270
here's the problem.
He's England proud boys,

239
00:11:55,271 --> 00:12:00,271
fucking Japan,
like it's everywhere and it never was

240
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:05,281
supposed to get to that point and
regardless of how these people act,

241
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,860
it now reflects on Gavin even though he
wanted to hang out in a bar with a few

242
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:15,460
people do is public speaking without
being hassled and that's it.

243
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,730
And I see the way the media manipulates
things.

244
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:23,731
I've been party to it myself and I've
seen Gavin presented in photos where you

245
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:26,320
look and go,
holy fuck.

246
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,550
It's Hitler.
Like,

247
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,280
like they get them.
There's one picture,

248
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,880
Gavin,
that I was petrified by.

249
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,610
He's got his arms folded,
he's got a scowl on his face,

250
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,020
that hair,
you know,

251
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:38,410
the short on the side,
long on the top and he's looking like

252
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,390
he's angry and I'm like that.

253
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,320
That's not the guy that him and his wife
who's American Indian by the way.

254
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,740
His wife is American Indian.
He's got beautiful kids that come over

255
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:50,590
my house and use the pool and we hang
out and barbecue.

256
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,540
I'm like,
that's not that guy.

257
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,590
No one knows that guy from the paper.
They're getting this impression.

258
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,710
He's a really nice guy.
He's.

259
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,850
He's a generous.
Just a really cool guy to hang out with

260
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,080
and what you see them do in the media is
just crazy.

261
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:12,730
Especially when you know he didn't
invent some Goddamn Nazi group.

262
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,300
He was just trying to have a little
outrageous fun and it ran from him.

263
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,280
It got away from them.
