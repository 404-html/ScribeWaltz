1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,950
What's it called again?
What's the gym called?

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,110
Verde Valley.
Brazilian Jujitsu.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,840
So Verde Valley Bjj and what?
What town is that in?

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,570
Old Town.
Cottonwood and Arizona.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,260
So you essentially like a invested in,
built a gym out there,

6
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:22,090
so you'd have a place to train 
basically.

7
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:23,710
Yeah.
That's such a smart move.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,120
Yeah.
It's kind of what you have to do,

9
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:25,960
right?
Yeah.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,370
Otherwise you'd have to drive hours to 
mega tons down south.

11
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:31,890
There's a bunch of places down there,
but they're just.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,320
It's a two hour drive.
There's also Ted Osbourne.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,670
I was branches.
Jitsu has an academy there.

14
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,270
When you decide like where are you going
to live?

15
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,820
When you decide where you're going to 
like decide to spend all your time,

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,480
like do you ever go,
what the fuck am I doing in the middle 

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,200
of nowhere in Arizona?
I'm maintaining peace of mind and I 

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,810
remind myself of that right away.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,960
So that's like a central.
It's planned out in the sense that just 

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,281
that,
that isolation a little bit just to be 

21
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:03,310
able to unplug and reset.
I think just my introvert nature,

22
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,690
I need.
I need that time.

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,970
I need that.
I need that introspection.

24
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,560
I need that moment.
Yeah,

25
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:10,450
because of you,
you are kind of an introvert,

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,030
but you're also kind of an extrovert.
I mean,

27
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,460
you're the lead singer of tool.
I mean,

28
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:21,180
it's not like,
I mean you can only be so introverted 

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,470
and do what you do,
so you have to kind of fluctuated 

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:25,470
between Alex,
but I need to recharge.

31
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,941
I need to unplug and go back and 
recharge and that I can go back out and 

32
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:30,160
do that.
A lot of people never figured that out.

33
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:31,390
Right?
They just kind of burn.

34
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,410
They burned the fuck out.
How'd you figure out to not do that?

35
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,300
Um,
first couple of years of being in La,

36
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,970
realize it was just such an energy sap.
I needed to actually literally go 

37
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:45,970
someplace where there were very few 
people.

38
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,070
Yeah.
That's the move,

39
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:48,330
right?

40
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,060
God,
I always keep

41
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,510
thinking I should do that.
Every time I go to some small town,

42
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,760
I'm like,
this is probably the way to live.

43
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,050
Just like know the people around you 
live around a few thousand people,

44
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,550
you know,
have a grocery store that can backfire 

45
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,550
too.
Oh,

46
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,550
totally.
Yeah.

47
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,890
Small town,
small town,

48
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,950
big town drama.
It ends up being the same thing,

49
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:11,650
but you actually,
it's not a stranger yelling at you.

50
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:12,520
It's your neighbor.
Well,

51
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:17,521
I think the small town dramas better if 
there's a college in town for some 

52
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:18,070
reason.
Right?

53
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,500
Like those places like boulder or 
there's a bunch of cities like that.

54
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,760
Bozeman,
Montana is a good example.

55
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,250
There's these places that are like,
they're not big,

56
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,670
but the university somehow another 
balances out the intellectual vibe of 

57
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,820
the town.
I could see that.

58
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,140
Yeah,
like bolder.

59
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:35,870
Yeah.

60
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,850
Boulder.
I wonder

61
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,850
what is like now in the height and fury 
of Social Justice Warrior online 

62
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,350
activism.
I wonder if boulder has gotten weird.

63
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,440
I haven't been bashed because that 
replaces kind of ramped up that shit 

64
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,010
over the last few years.
So you get me okay.

65
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:54,010
On this right to do some beautiful.
Can you hear me okay?

66
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:59,011
Connor Sanomat,
he's got conor mcgregor standing right 

67
00:02:59,011 --> 00:02:59,980
in front of him for advice.
So if anything south connor

68
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,170
doesn't have is fuck you pinstripe suit 
on though.

69
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,020
He's got his fuck you attitude in his 
fists right now.

70
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,810
Did you see the press conference?
No,

71
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,750
I.
that's one of those.

72
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:11,680
I was trying to find what's the edit to 
like watch that thing rather than this.

73
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,610
There's so much streaming going on.
I had no idea what I was looking for the

74
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:20,611
best for all.
You want to see as connor talking a 

75
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:21,340
little bit of little bit of floyd 
mayweather responding,

76
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,670
but connor talking does Dana White's 
video feed?

77
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,710
You could watch on d.
We can put it up right now.

78
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,820
You want to.
You want to listen to it.

79
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,850
Why not go to Dana White's instagram 
profile and then once you go to his 

80
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:38,101
instagram profile,
go to the video that's playing in his 

81
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:43,291
youtube.
There's like a link like on his 

82
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,220
instagram,
but ca connor's hilarious man.

83
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:50,221
He's fucking hilarious and he's laughing
and having a great time and floyd seem 

84
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:55,810
like he seemed a little rattled by like 
how confident this guy is when they were

85
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,120
going face to face is standing off with 
each other.

86
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,050
Yeah,
give me some volume when they get face 

87
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,050
to face

88
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,840
it.
Go back to that.

89
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:10,310
Listen to them talk some shit.
I'm going to go before that.

90
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,150
He is a zoom anymore.

91
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,290
Go before that.
There you go.

92
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:16,870
Right there.
Right there,

93
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:16,950
right?

94
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,880
It can't even afford it anymore.
Damn.

95
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,690
He is

96
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,580
his little.
His little head.

97
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,520
I'm going to knock them out inside four 
rounds.

98
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,880
Wait until they get in front of me

99
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,330
each other and they start John

100
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,760
and August mcgregor line.
I've been on the pins.

101
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,270
Busy as fuck.
You know.

102
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,130
Let's get this.
Let's have fun.

103
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,150
Thank you so much everybody.
Appreciate it.

104
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,610
And Floyd Mayweather get in front of 
each other.

105
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,120
So scoot.
Scoot ahead to inhuman.

106
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,170
Flug is floyd gets up and says a bunch 
of Shit and bunch of other people say a 

107
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,230
bunch of Shit.
Floyd.

108
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,760
Look really stupid.
Backup a little bit.

109
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:24,000
Can you see floyd hold up his truck is 
check for $100.

110
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,040
Million.
Look at back it up,

111
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:26,490
back it up.

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,320
You motherfuckers out of fight or flight
test.

113
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,540
Shit.
That's in a tax man and I'm attached.

114
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,260
Show Shit.
You're going on your face or you're 

115
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,600
going on your bed.
Now let him use his show up.

116
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,030
You just show up and I'm going to do the
rest face to face anyway.

117
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,290
This

118
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,210
is a real fight.
You're dead already.

119
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,270
Oh,
this is amazing.

120
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Do your hands hurt when it gets cold?
Because Floyd had a bunch of hand 

121
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,300
surgeries.
He goes,

122
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,100
you got brittle hands.
The hands hurt when it gets cold.

123
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,170
They hurt when it's cold.
Yeah,

124
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,650
I have no,
I,

125
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:20,620
I don't know enough about boxing to have
any clue.

126
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,980
All I can look at it from a distance is,
is floyd's older?

127
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,830
He's slightly smaller.
He's also the greatest defensive boxer 

128
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,910
of all time.
Right?

129
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Like literally of all time.
And Michael Jordan was arguably one of 

130
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,050
the best basketball player,
but put him back in the game today.

131
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,270
You have a flood?
Has it been now for that long?

132
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,450
I mean he's still relevant.
I mean he's only been a couple of years.

133
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,900
I think it was two years since his last 
fight against Andre Berto.

134
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,430
Was it two years and then before that?
The pack?

135
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:50,080
Yeah.
I'll fight,

136
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,590
you know,
look,

137
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,870
he's not as crime.
So yeah.

138
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:53,950
I'm saying,
you know,

139
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,650
so that was,
that was my look.

140
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,690
That's what you look at,
you and go age,

141
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,930
reach all that stuff,
size watching what happened to mcgregor 

142
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,680
up against dss,
having that wasn't really ready for that

143
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,760
larger dude to hit him.
Yeah.

144
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,090
Um,
is that the equation?

145
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,320
But then,
you know,

146
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,680
Mcgregor's no joke.
So He's,

147
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,190
you know,
he but Kenny handle a guy who's done 

148
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,950
this a hundred times times.

149
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,860
He's done it more than 100 timing.
Floyd's grew up doing it.

150
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,620
The thing about floyd is I think you 
have an idea of what you can do to women

151
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:29,970
until you get inside the ring with them 
and then you realize how good he is.

152
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,320
His defense is just on another level.
He's just in a completely different zone

153
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,760
all by himself.
His movement,

154
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,910
the way he's able to figure out what 
you're going to do with the way he 

155
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,520
processes your movement,
throws it into his boxing computer.

156
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:46,521
And then before you know,
and he's catching you before you even 

157
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:46,560
know what you're doing.
He's just a wizard band when it comes to

158
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:48,150
boxing.
The thing is,

159
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,540
connor is a way bigger guy.
He's younger.

160
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,190
He's way stronger.
I mean physically stronger.

161
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,510
Not just in terms of like punching 
power,

162
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,810
he's way stronger with punching power,
but he's also like stronger physically.

163
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,870
Like if he gets a hold of floyd and 
starts manipulating them.

164
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:07,350
I'm very curious to see what like his,
his trainer John Kavanagh is a very,

165
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:12,351
very smart guy.
I know he's also worked with Paulie 

166
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,710
Malignaggi who's a world champion and 
one of the best boxing commentators in 

167
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:15,930
the business.
He's helping connor.

168
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,350
It's going to be interesting.
You know on paper you would have to say 

169
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,370
floyd as a massive advantage,
but all this shit talking.

170
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:26,840
Whereas on a man that's,
that's a different kind of shit.

171
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:29,160
Talking to employees ever experienced 
and had that.

172
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,530
He's got a guy telling him,
I can kill you easy.

173
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,920
He's like,
got a guy telling you that this is a 

174
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:36,920
real fight.
You're dead.

175
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,170
You're dead in 20 knows he's right.
He knows he's right.

176
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,600
Floyd fucking knows it.
If Floyd,

177
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,480
he let his ego get crazy.
Let's have an MMA match.

178
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,150
Let's go ahead and have an MMA match 
that he said.

179
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,980
That's it.
He's a dead man.

180
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,430
He's fighting them in the octagon there 
and with four ounce gloves to.

181
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:51,810
Yeah,
he said that he's ridiculous.

182
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:56,811
Let them use elbows.
Let them you just give them one more 

183
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:59,841
weapon and you're fucked.
You tie up and you want to do this and 

184
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:01,530
over the top comes an elbow and your 
fucking legs give out on you.

185
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,230
One given one more weapon.
Give him knees.

186
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,460
Knees are leg kicks.
We can't we.

187
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,090
It's crazy.
Like I just think connor,

188
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:12,360
I just think you need to calm down a 
little bit and give him some beautiful.

189
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,220
Don't give him any space.
Just kidding.

190
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:17,190
A little bit of space stuff showed up to
this little space.

191
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,610
Just Space Joe.
That is A.

192
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,500
I'm the guy who makes those a bad 
motherfucker.

193
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,320
How do you pronounce his name?
Plastics.

194
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,810
Plastic.
Plastic stuff now,

195
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,930
but the gentleman who makes her fall 
along Tran,

196
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,710
I believe he's a bad motherfucker.
Pretty amazing.

197
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,730
Yeah.
That's crazy.

198
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:33,750
Right?
So,

199
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,900
so accurate.
The big.

200
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:37,950
You've seen the beginning.
Where's Biggie that we had to move them?

201
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,830
We were doing something here.
Look at the big one and the Tupac.

202
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:43,510
One guy's a wizard man.
That's my,

203
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,320
that's me.
Who's that guy?

204
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,870
Um,
but look,

205
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:50,910
it's a spectacle.
You know what happens,

206
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,620
happens.
Yeah.

207
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,040
I hold back.
This is what it's all

208
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,000
about.
Oh yeah.

209
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,710
It's not like whatever happens in the 
ring.

210
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,370
Yeah.
Whatever.

211
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,880
That's gonna sell.
Yeah.

212
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,950
It's going to sell.
They're going to charge 100 bucks for 

213
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,090
paper review.
Her charging charge.

214
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:07,060
Who you're not going to pay,
you're going to pay.

215
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,480
How dare you?
Everyone listens.

216
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,830
Pain.
If you've got 100 bucks you can fuck it.

217
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,610
Have 10 people over.
It's 10 bucks,

218
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,060
but you wouldn't pay 10 bucks to see 
that you're out of your fucking mind.

219
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:21,061
I paid my screen.
The screen at my house is so awesome 

220
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:22,330
that it's actually,
it's worth like I had to.

221
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,910
I have to literally have to pay a 
thousand dollars to watch it.

222
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,770
So if you want to come over,
it's 100 bucks.

223
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,050
You have to pay a thousand dollars to 
watch when you mean.

224
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,030
Oh,
he's got a thing.

225
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,790
All right.
See what he's doing?

226
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,220
Yeah.
Do you have like one of those,

227
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,730
100 inch led or lcd?
What it is it led or LCD or led now?

228
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,230
Right.
I saw one at the,

229
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:43,090
uh,
at the store the other day at best buy.

230
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,090
They have like 100 inch TV.
Like that is fucking crazy.

231
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,790
You look at that thing.
It's almost too,

232
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,060
too good.
Yeah.

233
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,050
No,
no,

234
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,880
don't do that.
Are you filming?

235
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,800
You're filming a lot of Shit.
You do it in four k?

236
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,020
I don't know.
I mean all the video stuff.

237
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:04,870
We do a when that the one,
that red camera first came out,

238
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:09,871
we had some friends that were using math
and they were using the Canon for 

239
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:13,951
awhile.
I'm just filming on and I don't know 

240
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:17,010
what they're filming on.
I just know that over the last five 

241
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:22,711
years just insane.
Just jump in technology for filming.

242
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,320
It's been amazing not having to have 
like dude with like lights and some guy 

243
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:29,920
with a on a dolly.
No,

244
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:32,680
it's like the guy's a small,
tiny little thing.

245
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,110
Tiny thing doing insane,
insane work.

246
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,600
They have trail cams now that are in 
four k,

247
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,120
so like when they're looking for animals
in the woods,

248
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:45,121
they put these cameras up on trails and 
they capture motion capture and then 

249
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:48,871
they'd take video four k video and it's 
fucking amazing low light video and they

250
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:49,850
showed the difference.

251
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,850
There was something I was looking at 
yesterday and show the difference 

252
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,581
between state of the art two years ago 
versus state of the art today and the 

253
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:58,630
exact same location,
exact same time and it's crazy.

254
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,760
Like you could see everything crystal 
clear.

255
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:05,761
It's hd video from a tree,
a little box tied to a tree and it looks

256
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:08,920
like a fucking movie.
That's pretty awesome.

257
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:14,130
Dude.
You're missing out on that hide out in 

258
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:14,130
the middle of nowhere,
Arizona.

259
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:14,710
Not really though.
That's the thing.

260
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,840
It's not like when you're hiding out 
there,

261
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:18,580
you're still connected.
Yeah,

262
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,390
it's a,
it's.

263
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,820
We just finished our a two greenhouses 
there were planting them this next week,

264
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:28,030
so I've got full on greenhouses on one 
of the sites.

265
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,340
Are you totally off the grid?
Not off the grid,

266
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:31,510
no,
but I mean that would be,

267
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,420
that'd be nice.
I think that's the goal.

268
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,700
Feel like you can be right with solar.
Yeah.

269
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,750
And,
and I've waited on solar just to see 

270
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,290
again,
Canberra's were what they were two years

271
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,260
ago to today.
How are the solar panels catching up?

272
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,780
Because I know that that technology is 
insane.

273
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:48,520
Now,
do you know what Elon Musk is doing?

274
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,040
He's making solar powered powered roof 
tiles,

275
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,070
right?
So your whole roof is like a giant solar

276
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:55,820
generator,
which,

277
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,210
and those things are great.
So all you know,

278
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,170
I'm the kind of guy that wakes up,

279
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,380
I want,
I want to see.

280
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:02,450
Okay,
once he's put those in place,

281
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,280
how do they do against tile?
A hail.

282
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,010
How did they do sun?
How.

283
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:13,030
That's a good point.
I want to see how those things last 

284
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,030
because I'm not going to invest all that
money and,

285
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,730
and a roof tiles.
If all of a sudden they find it a year 

286
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,080
that they,
that crack under Arizona Sunshine.

287
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,860
You get crazy storms in Arizona to do 
near the place where they get typhoons.

288
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,880
Is that,
is it typhoons and monsoons?

289
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,700
Monsoons.
Yeah.

290
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:30,770
Science students.
We just started seeing evidence like 

291
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,110
yesterday we got hailed and like a 
little dabble of monsoon yesterday.

292
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Yeah,
like sometimes like people think of 

293
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Arizona,
the thing of the desert,

294
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,770
but there's a lot of different terrain 
in Arizona.

295
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,790
Yes.
Yes.

296
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,170
And you guys,
when it rains you guys get fucking 

297
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:44,170
pounded on,
right?

298
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,070
What is this gym?
The hail test for the tesla roof tiles.

299
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,000
A lifetime warranty on them.
Boom.

300
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,770
Oh,
it took it like a champ.

301
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,700
And what are those other two bitches?
Yeah,

302
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,840
the regular traditional roof tiles.
Oh,

303
00:15:57,841 --> 00:16:02,841
they're regular roof tiles.
So the Tesla panels are fucking better 

304
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:03,900
bench 100 mile an hour impact.
Wow.

305
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,060
Well then there you have it.
I'm in.

306
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:11,530
Yeah,
because that's what I've been waiting 

307
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:11,530
for it to see if they can get this,
that technology up.

308
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,050
I'm just waiting for Elon Musk to run 
the world.

309
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,650
I'm like,
Dude,

310
00:16:13,651 --> 00:16:15,150
you're on point.
Keep it up.

311
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,170
Yeah,
just make roof tiles and cars and just 

312
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,170
keep it up.

313
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,170
Yeah.
Ben,

314
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,180
you know,
I don't know that being completely off 

315
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,000
the grid is.
I think it's an option for some people.

316
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:29,340
There's just too many people.
For you to be actually,

317
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,700
you know,
completely unplug and be isolated.

318
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,980
Yeah.
I don't want to be comedy ones.

319
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,780
Don't know it doesn't work.
Was going to be trade.

320
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,000
He's turned into a big fuck fest.
Right.

321
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:41,400
It's like the one that you'd be like the

322
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,580
leader and you just want to bang and 
everybody's wife.

323
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,750
I don't know.
From experience that you're.

324
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,370
That you're aware of a let now.
Yes.

325
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,790
Yes.
It is what happens,

326
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,500
right?
I don't see.

327
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:58,190
I think that like off the grid,
like in terms of like non reliance,

328
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,460
but connectivity in terms of like being 
able to figure out what's going on in 

329
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:03,460
the world.
Yeah.

330
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:03,460
Yeah.
That,

331
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,070
that,
that's a,

332
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:09,110
that's a reasonable goal I think,
but I think even even being off the 

333
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,820
grid,
I feel like,

334
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:15,821
uh,
you can get to a certain point in 

335
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:18,210
today's society where you can be 
unplugged from your,

336
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,770
your power and your water,
but somebody's going to come for your 

337
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:23,770
water,
so he's going to come for.

338
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,040
There's various places around the United
States where they come after you for 

339
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,070
growing your own food on your land.
Do they really?

340
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:34,190
Yeah.
There's weird stuff everywhere like 

341
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:34,190
that.
Like what?

342
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:34,200
What kind of regulations or do they have
against?

343
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,640
It ended up using.
They would probably justify it in terms 

344
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,640
of your house.
Your House is zoned residential,

345
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,350
not Oh,
not agriculture or you're,

346
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,880
you,
you're not allowed to use the city water

347
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:49,920
to water your garden.

348
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,370
I've actually heard this before.
I've heard people get in trouble with 

349
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:55,370
that before.
It's a,

350
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,010
it's just another level of government 
control.

351
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,720
Do you think that doing that,
it's just like,

352
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,060
no,
you're not,

353
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,330
you're not a prepper.
Right?

354
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,760
I'm a prepper,
but slightly but not.

355
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,780
Not In that Alex Jones sort of way.
No,

356
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:11,370
not that.
Not that bananas.

357
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Uh,
I think just being prepared and 

358
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,621
understanding that eventually the,
there'll be an interruption and the 

359
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:21,861
water that comes to you and the food 
that gets to just understanding how to 

360
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:22,410
grow food is not being a prepper.

361
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,560
No,
it's wise.

362
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,440
It's like having a lot of boxes checked 
off.

363
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,900
We just.
And it also doesn't it feel good.

364
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,990
Like I'm sure I know that you love your 
wine.

365
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,020
I mean,
it's got to feel good when you have a 

366
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,940
glass of the wine that you've grown and 
created and worked so hard on and it 

367
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,460
just established this perfect time of 
keeping in the barrels and you know,

368
00:18:45,431 --> 00:18:48,070
I'm sure there's got to be like massive 
satisfaction to that.

369
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,060
Absolutely.

370
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,680
Because you know,
it spirals out into all these other,

371
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,740
other areas of understanding again,
how to,

372
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,570
how to grow your own food.
You start,

373
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,900
you start talking to and communicating 
with people that you wouldn't normally 

374
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,210
talk to like Republican guys now talking
to the Liberal Democrat guy and the,

375
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:12,211
and the,
and this religion is talking to that 

376
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:12,820
religion and you know,
there's all these economic,

377
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,850
religious,
political lines get blurred because in 

378
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,381
that moment,
talking about growing a thing and 

379
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:24,090
sustaining a local community,
a lot of those things tend to go away.

380
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:29,130
Just turn this thing off and get back to
understanding what it's going to take to

381
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:36,631
make you know,
make these exchanges and do these 

382
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:38,701
activities.
You start to really feel connected with 

383
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:42,580
people rather than this weird divisive 
crap that goes on in the world.

384
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,240
Yeah,
I think there's definitely like we need 

385
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,581
to figure out how to spend more time 
just having a regular normal day to day 

386
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:54,661
conversations because it seems to me 
like people are worse at it than they 

387
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:55,900
ever been before.
People interrupt people more than like,

388
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,990
they're not good at like listening and 
talking because I think people are so 

389
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,890
accustomed to communicating with people 
through devices.

390
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,280
It's almost like we're were rusty were 
rusty on how we talk to people because 

391
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,901
we don't do it that much.
Like how often do you call someone on 

392
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:15,781
the phone?
Not that you and I have maybe never had 

393
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,991
a phone call.
Maybe one phone conversations always 

394
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:19,480
text and kind of all my friends.
If someone calls me up,

395
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:20,380
it's like,
what's everything?

396
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:21,320
Okay.
Yeah.

397
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,120
Like what's wrong?
Yeah.

398
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:22,180
Yeah.

399
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:27,430
No,
I don't use that thing for talking to 

400
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,430
somebody.
I don't use this.

401
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:31,190
Don't use this to talk to people because
the technology to me still isn't where 

402
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,981
it should be because I'll be in the 
middle of making a point with somebody 

403
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:39,880
and the phone call will drop and we have
to start over and so he got mad because 

404
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:45,210
I just,
that's why I usually text her email 

405
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,201
because I can get the whole thought down
and then if we want to talk about 

406
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:48,160
summing up some details it I'll say I'll
call

407
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,500
you from landline.
So I'll actually call people from.

408
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,490
I'll find a landline,
you know?

409
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,480
Have you heard of those?
They don't even have them anymore.

410
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,260
The red red around illegal right around 
the same time as the cassette.

411
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,200
I send a raven.
That's what I do.

412
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,900
I got some dope ravens.
They're super smart.

413
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,860
You just got to leave like pineapple in 
the and that's what they like to go 

414
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:10,870
right to the pineapple take.
They're a little message.

415
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,080
What's up?
See this today.

416
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,580
Oh Jesus Christ

417
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,080
to scientists make teleportation 
breakthrough,

418
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,830
but that's in the New York Post.
They also did an article about how 

419
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,550
Travis Browne and Ronda Rousey are 
fading losers.

420
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:30,350
Like it was the most ruthless article.
That is a great.

421
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,470
It's a great argument for not living in 
a condensed population and some of the 

422
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,300
articles in New York tabloid papers,
like they're so fucking mean.

423
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,210
Yeah.
Just something about like being in the,

424
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,160
like an island,
like Manhattan where.

425
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:48,161
But he stopped in there where people 
just get super shitty with each other 

426
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:48,161
and they find it okay to do so.
Yeah.

427
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,820
So what does this teleportation.

428
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,160
It's saying that it's teleporter to 
photon from Earth to space,

429
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:57,680
like 50 miles in this space.
That's not exactly what happened.

430
00:21:57,681 --> 00:22:00,350
They transported the information of the 
Proton,

431
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,830
which is also,
it's equally important because they can 

432
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,550
send out a fax to somebody again.
Space.

433
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,610
Wow.
Wow.

434
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,390
Mit saying it.

435
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,340
So in sending a Photon,
is that like one step to sending light?

436
00:22:17,341 --> 00:22:17,440
Yeah,

437
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,550
take the first step to say like it made 
it like a carbon copy of it.

438
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:24,520
It's virtually identical.
It's like an identical twin of it.

439
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:24,640
So

440
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,400
it could be that,
that,

441
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,690
you know,
those kinds of newspapers are very 

442
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,411
similar to what we're seeing with 
facebook as far as the immediate 

443
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:37,511
feedback.
And then they adjust the article and 

444
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:38,240
adjust the,
the headline to not only make money from

445
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,420
clicks,
but also to manipulate what you were 

446
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,331
thinking about a particular subject so 
they can adjust your vote purchasing 

447
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,600
patterns of those kinds of things.
So you know these click bait things.

448
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:55,601
That could have been a word in that 
title that they know people like you 

449
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:58,511
love to see.
So they got you clicking on it even 

450
00:22:58,511 --> 00:22:58,511
though there might be nothing in the 
article.

451
00:22:58,511 --> 00:22:59,620
There's a lot of that,
right?

452
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,860
You see like purposely deceptive article
headings.

453
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,170
So they did,
they rope you in and you're like,

454
00:23:06,171 --> 00:23:07,700
what?
What are they doing?

455
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,000
But even doing that,
like are they talk well,

456
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,470
what happens?
Your original Photon,

457
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:15,850
the original photon remains present in 
the original location.

458
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:21,030
It's a first step in some quantum 
physics type deal proving that it can 

459
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:26,041
actually happen.
Versus like just being a theory as far 

460
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,650
as I understood.
I listened to a one minute video where I

461
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,580
talked to my buddy about this buy,
are you buying any of this?

462
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,700
Fuck all that.
Fuck all them.

463
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Anywhere in that dorm.
One point you and your Fox on you and 

464
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,550
your Proton,
one foot in your fucking proton.

465
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,010
Yeah.
I don't understand what they're.

466
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,010
So does that

467
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,010
mean like one day they'll have a jamie 
vernon on a space holodeck in Arizona 

468
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,450
and they'll zoom you up to space,
but then you'll still be here.

469
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,500
It's hard to say.
I don't think that that's what they're 

470
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,001
doing with it.
I think this means more like they can 

471
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:02,981
send the packets of information without 
needing fiber or Wifi or anything like 

472
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:06,230
that.
I think that's the first possible use of

473
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:06,410
it.

474
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,540
I think it's a matter of time before we 
start duplicating things that we 

475
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:11,540
shouldn't be duplicating.
You know,

476
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,431
like a whole human beings like how many 
deranged monarchs are going to get a 

477
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:23,071
hold of this like way before anybody 
else is trillionaire dudes and they're 

478
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:27,200
gonna spend a shit ton of money to have 
copies of them and just make a bunch of 

479
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,940
this.
What if it's just a heath ledger's the 

480
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,050
joker who is actually putting this out 
and he's figured out a way to get all of

481
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:36,900
those beginner people to jump on this 
spaceship.

482
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:41,130
That goes nowhere and he's giggling 
somewhere.

483
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,200
See,
I always say we feel like we were always

484
00:24:43,201 --> 00:24:46,710
one invention that we don't see coming 
away from ruining everything.

485
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,450
Yeah.
Yeah,

486
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,840
I agree.
It could be,

487
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,150
it could be exactly.
This kind of thing.

488
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:53,130
This,
this algorithmic.

489
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,400
You going down a rabbit hole in this,
a narcissistic feedback on what you want

490
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:00,720
to see and then it tells,
tells you what you want to hear and then

491
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:02,010
it gets you to buy what you want to buy.

492
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,460
But like the thing you want to buy might
be this rabbit hole of,

493
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,160
of leveling the playing field for 
everybody.

494
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,840
Yeah.
It might be wants.

495
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,310
Um,
yeah.

496
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:13,190
I think the only.
Yeah.

497
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,860
Is there a way out of that?
Um,

498
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,920
doesn't seem like it.
Well,

499
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:21,921
I think the other,
the way out of it is his understanding 

500
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:27,410
that the things you're being told here,
this has nothing to do with mastership,

501
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,240
if that makes sense.
The phone,

502
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:36,050
just media things.
You're reading on your social media 

503
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:36,050
pages.
This has nothing to do with a guy.

504
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,380
I read all those articles.
Well that's not necessarily mastership.

505
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,340
That's not.
You're going to a master who has,

506
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,540
who has spent all this time doing a 
thing or researching a thing and 

507
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,940
master's degree in a thing,
and then you go to this class,

508
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,990
you take the time,
the effort it takes to get to that place

509
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:57,290
at every step along the way is a new 
level of revelation or some kind of 

510
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,710
epiphany of understanding of,
oh,

511
00:25:58,711 --> 00:26:03,711
that's why we did this,
and then now I can understand that and 

512
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:04,590
educate yourself,
so destroying,

513
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,110
destroying an entire base of ignorance 
and knee jerk reaction,

514
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,810
clicking on links and being fed 
horseshit.

515
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,280
It almost has to be like a,
a conscious effort on each individual to

516
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:21,810
step back and go,
I hate that trump supporter.

517
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:26,811
I hate that hillary or a Bernie 
supporter because of the things I've 

518
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:28,680
been told and the things I believe that 
had been fed back to me.

519
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,020
Um,
what if,

520
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,200
then this is the hardest step,
I think for most people.

521
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:38,130
What if I am completely wrong about all 
of it?

522
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,390
So how do I empty my vessel,
opened my mind,

523
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:45,180
and try to figure backtrack on what the 
truth is?

524
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,220
Is this person really that much 
different than me?

525
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,640
Are these people that much different?
Did they grow up with a bad you bad set 

526
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,770
of poison in their system that I grew up
with a bad poison in my system?

527
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,340
I don't know.
So I don't know if there's any way out 

528
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,411
of it because the solution I'm talking 
about requires a lot of introspection,

529
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,380
a self evaluation,
and a lot of,

530
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,100
uh,
being more open than most people are 

531
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,100
willing to be.

532
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,830
Do you know why?
I think there's a way out of it because 

533
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,661
there's a lot of people like you saying 
that I know a lot of people that are 

534
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:21,481
saying that now and it seems like a 
message that's being broadcast by a 

535
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:25,801
bunch of people that have gone through 
the gauntlet of life and had a bunch of 

536
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:30,481
trials and tribulations and they reached
this point where they kind of have an 

537
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:32,140
understanding of what it's taken them to
get there.

538
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,560
And a lot of people like you have this 
desire to relay this information and 

539
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,490
people are listening and there's a lot 
of other people that are saying the same

540
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,150
thing that have also gone through their 
own separate trials and I think it's a,

541
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,940
it's a more prevalent message than I've 
ever heard in my life.

542
00:27:45,941 --> 00:27:49,420
And I'm almost 50.
I'll be 50 next month and I feel like in

543
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:50,500
my life I've never.

544
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,310
August 11th.
Really?

545
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,520
Yup.
What's your birthday is a 12.

546
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,980
Get the fuck Outta here,
bitch.

547
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,760
Uh,
my,

548
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,900
my son's birthday's the fifth.
My wine making buddies is the eighth 

549
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,170
crazy.
I went in and out of the army the first 

550
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,361
week of August.
We're basically all in the same 

551
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:09,361
fraternity basically,
except for me.

552
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:10,120
I'm on areas.
What's a girl's thing?

553
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,590
It's not a fraternity.
What is it called?

554
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:12,340
Sorority.
Yeah.

555
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:14,250
We're in the same sorority.
Oh my God.

556
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,240
Was the same month.
Are you going?

557
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,780
Just the new ge?
Yeah.

558
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,010
I think more people are talking about 
though,

559
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:23,020
man.
I think it's going to be not going to be

560
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:25,120
for everybody,
but I think there's way more people that

561
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:28,870
are trying to do better with their life,
do better with their mind,

562
00:28:28,871 --> 00:28:30,230
do better with themselves.
It's a,

563
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:31,870
it's a very,
very common thing.

564
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,960
So much so there's a lot of criticisms 
about the various methods and people 

565
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,880
kind of losing sight and then there's 
like,

566
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:42,900
there's a bunch of bullshit artists that
are capitalizing on this idea as well 

567
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,711
and they're not really doing it,
but they're pretending they're doing it 

568
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:46,840
and they're talking about it,
but they're not really an action.

569
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,630
But you can kind of see those guys 
always look a little doughy.

570
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,100
They always look a little,
you know,

571
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:56,101
they're not really doing it,
but they're talking about people love 

572
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,911
talking about shit.
They don't really do like some of my 

573
00:28:59,911 --> 00:28:59,911
friends that,
uh,

574
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:02,080
they'll talk about writing comedy way 
more than they actually write comedy.

575
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,520
Like Judd apatow said that he said like,
don't fucking talk about writing just 

576
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,230
right.
I think he's right.

577
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,740
Nice one.
Right?

578
00:29:11,741 --> 00:29:12,850
I mean,
isn't it the same thing?

579
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,540
It's like there's a fine line between 
inspiring,

580
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:21,541
discussing and then sort of analyzing 
with people that you respect and trust 

581
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,740
and like and then actually doing the 
work.

582
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,760
Yeah,
and I think part of it is literally 

583
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,310
working.
I think I'm getting your hands dirty in 

584
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,120
the soil,
like find a as a star.

585
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:38,150
It's just think of it as therapy.
Whatever money you're spending on a 

586
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,951
therapist,
take take that time and go find a 

587
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:42,040
community garden.
Just we'd

588
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,040
just go in there and plant some,
find some carrots,

589
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:50,100
do something to just kind of like unplug
and touch dirt and do a thing and 

590
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:55,501
reconnect with that cycle.
If you can reconnect with that cycle of 

591
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:57,520
life in some level,
you start to really understand what,

592
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,670
what's more important.
You know,

593
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,980
some people,
some people have kids that helps them 

594
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,220
kind of reground themselves and redirect
and focus their energies.

595
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,770
Um,
some people will just find,

596
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,240
you know,
find gardening in that way.

597
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,450
But this is,
this is not this,

598
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,730
this is supposed to be a convenience.
This is just me trying to talk to you 

599
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,551
from a distance and every.
But as far as the information you're 

600
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:22,390
getting off of this thing and forms of 
social media,

601
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,540
there's a lot of poise and there's a lot
of misdirect.

602
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:31,260
There's a lot of crap in there and you 
have to kind of fight through it and 

603
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,170
literally go eat a garden.

604
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:37,430
Yeah,
I think just think you're definitely 

605
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:37,430
right.
I think doing that as good.

606
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,590
I also think doing difficult things is,
is good.

607
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:43,830
I think that's one of the reasons why 
you're so drawn to Jujitsu and the 

608
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,750
hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
It's the hardest thing that it's the,

609
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:46,300
it's the most.
It's,

610
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:48,610
you know,
I'm getting no snowflakey be here.

611
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,110
Um,
but it's just,

612
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,070
it's,
it's,

613
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,520
uh,
it's not something that you are handed.

614
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,640
You have to do the work to get it.
And I had so many injuries over the 

615
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,740
years and it's so much distance from 
this thing and I'm such a stubborn prick

616
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:03,640
that I'm,
I have,

617
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,650
I've started a thing,
I'm going to finish this thing.

618
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:11,190
Uh,
so that's Kinda where I'm at with 

619
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,681
Jujitsu and it's not,
it's not something that you can be 

620
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:13,681
handled.
Well,

621
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:18,631
you know,
someone's legit when they get a fucking 

622
00:31:18,631 --> 00:31:19,090
hip surgery and then the back on the mat
four months later,

623
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,910
that is first of all ridiculous and not 
advisable,

624
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,800
but admirable at the same time.

625
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,050
It took me,
it took me a while to lose the weight.

626
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:34,060
I was gaining weight before the hip 
surgery because I just couldn't move as 

627
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,900
well as I wanted to.
Um,

628
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,270
obviously,
I mean it was completely destroyed hip.

629
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,970
No,
no cushion in there.

630
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:41,290
And uh,
and then the recovery was,

631
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,520
and then I was on the row,
which is like one of the worst ways to 

632
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,570
recover from anything you're trying to 
recover from being there in the moment.

633
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,200
But the thing I did finally found my 
rhythm because I think last time we 

634
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,110
talked,
I talked about how it's hard to train on

635
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:59,440
the road because I've got this thing I 
got to do with at night.

636
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:05,850
Finding those guys,
finding the black belts that understand 

637
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,560
the low,
low impact flow role,

638
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,650
uh,
putting threads together.

639
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,670
Just doing simple a positional drills,
all those things.

640
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:17,470
Now I've been able to,
like I,

641
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,700
you know,
I trained with Dave and Dan Camereo,

642
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,630
Henry Akins,
Rodrigo comes down,

643
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,910
touch flocks,
comes down.

644
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,170
I've been able to train with a lot of 
people on the road that's amazing.

645
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,170
May Not be folk.
We find our,

646
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,300
we find our,
our right before sound check and you 

647
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,610
know,
but it has to be people that trust us to

648
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:40,340
be people that have an understanding of 
I'm not here to do this,

649
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,950
I'm here to do the same music.
Yeah.

650
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,960
This is just something that helps you 
get to that.

651
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:45,530
Yeah.
So it's,

652
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,870
I'm just chipping away at that purple 
belt,

653
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,900
trying to get to that next level.
Yeah.

654
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,780
I feel like I'm in my opinion,
drills or like one of the most important

655
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:56,080
things that people don't like to do is 
this.

656
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,490
It's just one of those things where it's
Jujitsu,

657
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:02,090
like rolling and sparring.
It's so fun that people just want to get

658
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:03,140
right in there.
We'll just roll it.

659
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,760
Let's just roll.
And so you just kind of do it,

660
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:07,460
but the real work is done in the 
drilling.

661
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,860
If you can't do it slow,
you can't do it fast,

662
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:12,830
especially if you don't understand it,
understand what it is you're supposed to

663
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:15,140
be doing,
and if you have a good part,

664
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:20,141
a training partner,
role player to help you and he's giving 

665
00:33:20,141 --> 00:33:22,190
you the exact position that you're,
that you're trying to train.

666
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,010
If he got one of those pricks,
that's like blue belt,

667
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,830
purple belt,
garlic,

668
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,600
no miss going to church,
I'm going to adjust this position to no,

669
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,280
that's not what you're,
that's not what you're here for.

670
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:37,020
Your troubles are important,
but like dead drills are important to 

671
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,280
where a person just,
you just roll,

672
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,380
just roll through the technique with 
them.

673
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,350
Right?
Yeah,

674
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,400
I mean it's like I've always found it 
really interesting how many people like 

675
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,590
find it sort of,
uh,

676
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,780
in,
in their life.

677
00:33:47,781 --> 00:33:52,781
And it becomes like almost like a 
replacement for religion and a lot of 

678
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,170
ways it comes,
like this grounding thing for them.

679
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,430
Yeah,
I can see that.

680
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,720
Yeah.
I mean it's just,

681
00:33:56,721 --> 00:34:01,721
it seems like the real difficult things,
whether it's Jujitsu or whatever you're 

682
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:01,721
into.
You know,

683
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:03,470
I have a buddy that's into ultra 
marathons.

684
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:05,090
That's his thing,
like it's just like pushy.

685
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,120
His body to run these crazy distances 
becomes like this weird sort of like 

686
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,970
centering threatened his life because he
knows it's so fucking difficult that all

687
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:16,040
the other things get easier.
Okay.

688
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,970
You know?
Yeah.

689
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,330
That's kick and run.
That's,

690
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,550
that's good for him.
I'll let him do that.

691
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,100
But you said that some people can run 
with a hip replacement?

692
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,160
Yeah,
I've heard that there's some guys that 

693
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:30,160
they'll go in every couple of years and 
have the,

694
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,860
the actual pad of Ithaca silicone pad or
something that they're just.

695
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,200
They just cut them open.
They're like small incision.

696
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,630
Pop it out,
pop the hip out.

697
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,960
I guess so.
I guess during the surgery they go in 

698
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:43,960
from the front.
Mike.

699
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,511
I went from the front so that you know 
my leg was laying across my head while 

700
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:49,931
they're in there digging my you.
So it's a full on scoping out the the 

701
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,820
hip.
I'm sawing,

702
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,900
sawing off the hip,
the leg,

703
00:34:56,901 --> 00:35:01,901
the femur bone,
putting a spike down the middle of your 

704
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:05,171
femur with a ball on top,
and then putting it back in and then 

705
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:05,780
waking you up about an hour later going,
let's go for a walk.

706
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,070
Oh my God.
How many?

707
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:12,130
How many inches is the spike?
A spike that goes into the ball?

708
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,430
I think it's like.
It's like about 20 Irish inches.

709
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,280
The size of my deck.

710
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,450
Sorry,
what are we talking about?

711
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,220
The deck.
Oh my God.

712
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,800
Look how far it goes in.
Yeah,

713
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,840
Jesus Christ.
It's huge.

714
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,740
Yeah.
Thank you.

715
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,340
Oh my goodness.
Look at that.

716
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,900
Oh my God.
That's freaking me out.

717
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,470
How does that not just like the 
mechanical leverage,

718
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,520
seems like it would just snap your 
femur.

719
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,860
Well,
a leg kick.

720
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:42,600
Do you think you'd be taken down?
Okay.

721
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:43,110
I.
I would,

722
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,760
I would.
Please don't.

723
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,780
Please don't give so many right at the 
bottom of that spike.

724
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,340
That's a wrap on.
Yeah.

725
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,890
I feel like right where that spike 
connects to the meet.

726
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:57,060
I feel like someone who's got a real 
good leg kick,

727
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:59,340
which is going right through that.
That's why,

728
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:04,341
but I think the bone density a,
what happens with the bone density is 

729
00:36:04,341 --> 00:36:08,091
that's why the appealing process is so 
slow because the bone is actually 

730
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:08,091
healing around that thing.

731
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:12,900
Right.
That's maybe in theory more dense than 

732
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:12,900
the actual spike.
Whoa,

733
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,840
but you're right.
Just the physics of hitting kicking that

734
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,370
you would think would.
That's your.

735
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,800
That's your weak spot.
What about like falling and stuff?

736
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:24,801
Do they advise you?
The one thing they don't have you do is 

737
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:26,220
if you were to bend my leg back when I 
need back that way,

738
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:29,250
like a lunge back onto this kind of 
thing,

739
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,280
it will pop out forward of Jesus Christ.
Now I'm even with no wait a no.

740
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,270
It would have to be some kind of weight 
that will push forward.

741
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:43,020
It used to be the way if I put my knees 
up on my chest to do like butterfly,

742
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,680
the way that they designed the hit 
before it would actually pop out that 

743
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:48,680
way,
but now they've fixed it where it's like

744
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,050
it has to be this other extreme angle to
get it to pop out,

745
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:53,070
but it can pop out.

746
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,930
Has it popped out on you yet?
No,

747
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:59,931
it has not.
Do you do any weight lifting to 

748
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:00,460
strengthen everything around?
It was a lot of,

749
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,150
a lot of walking,
you know,

750
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,660
uh,
some,

751
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:08,661
some weight training.
I really liked the kettle bells when 

752
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:08,720
that stuff.
Um,

753
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,890
I think just that,
just that wrestling,

754
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,570
you know,
working with somebody,

755
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:14,570
not actually doing the take downs for 
warmup.

756
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,380
I'd do take downs,
but you know,

757
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:21,381
just that act of,
of lateral front back and then having 

758
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:23,400
somebody pull you with those different 
ways and the low stance.

759
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,360
Yeah,
low stance.

760
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:27,900
I liked that low center of gravity drop 
then that's good for the legs for sure.

761
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:32,340
So kettlebells that the battle ropes,
those do body weight squats.

762
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,000
I do not.
I'm a big fan of body weight squats.

763
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:37,320
You're Hindu squats,
they call them.

764
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,990
Which type of squat that you do.

765
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,040
Will you do like a lot of reps?
I'll do 200 reps and what it's hard to 

766
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,040
do.
It's not.

767
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,010
It seems like it's easy because you do 
the first 10,

768
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:49,410
you're like,
I can do 200 and then you get to 20.

769
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:50,060
You're like,
Ooh.

770
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,440
And then you get to 50,
so there's no way you just,

771
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:54,030
you doing your thing.
Just me.

772
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,770
And you go,
you go down,

773
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,860
you go down,
you touched your,

774
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,990
you drop your hands back,
you touch your hands to the ground.

775
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,270
And then as you go up you bring your 
hands up for like,

776
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:05,880
I'll fuck that.
It looks like this.

777
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,160
It looks like this.
Hang on,

778
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:13,250
hang on.
I called Hindu squatting and gotta get 

779
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:13,250
counter ever.
What you stand like this and you,

780
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,440
you stand with your back straight up and
your hands are like behind your button.

781
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,740
You go down like this one,
two,

782
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:20,970
three.

783
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,340
And as I'm going down,
my heels go up.

784
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,700
So at the bottom,
like at the bottom,

785
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:31,170
I'm actually on the ball of my feet and 
my hands go behind my heels,

786
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,060
right?
And then as I come up,

787
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:38,090
I touched the ground and I go up to this
position and I breathe out as I do this,

788
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:42,730
I'm going to 100,
200 of these bitches.

789
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,670
I just done like five and I'm ready to 
take a nap.

790
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:50,410
He'll just keep going.
Let's have a donut.

791
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,080
Can we just have donuts?
No,

792
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:52,740
man.
I'm A.

793
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,310
I think a lot of people don't do enough 
shit with their legs.

794
00:38:57,311 --> 00:39:02,311
Is that what you do?
Is that the more shit you do with your 

795
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:02,920
legs where it's running or squatting or 
dead lifting?

796
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,310
It just your whole body feels better and
people neglect that shit.

797
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,760
Yeah,
I do more leg,

798
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,470
stuff like that.

799
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:13,470
Then I do arm stuff.
I think my next step is I talked about 

800
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:13,470
before is like,
you know,

801
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,760
I had broken my wrists.
I think the last time I was in here,

802
00:39:15,761 --> 00:39:17,570
I like that actually was a broken wrist 
out.

803
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:19,850
A sprained wrist.
Oh yeah.

804
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,880
So I actually broke both my wrists that 
year.

805
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,760
Um,
and I had shoulder issues.

806
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,750
A rotator shit issue.
So one thing too that I did those,

807
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,730
uh,
stem cells and not the,

808
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:32,740
a prp,
not the PRP.

809
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:33,920
The other one.
That one?

810
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,140
Yeah,
I think so.

811
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:36,100
That one.
Where'd you do it?

812
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,930
Uh,
in Arizona they were,

813
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,220
they were doing show.
Really?

814
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,390
They're not cheap.
No,

815
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,150
no.
It's not cheap.

816
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,990
They take your own blood and do it.
No,

817
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,480
it's not.
Regina King must be something different.

818
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:47,290
Okay.
So it's like,

819
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,060
you know,
something like that.

820
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:50,950
And then I started researching going,
Oh,

821
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,960
you know,
we just discovered Hep c a couple of 

822
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,531
years ago,
maybe I shouldn't be putting some kind 

823
00:39:58,531 --> 00:39:58,531
of weird foreign shit.

824
00:39:58,531 --> 00:39:58,610
And they just discovered Hep c a couple 
of years.

825
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,790
Just hepatitis than general.
Like it's,

826
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,080
you know,
it's like on the rise.

827
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,930
Well,
20 years ago people didn't know what the

828
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:05,880
hell that was,
you know,

829
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,110
30 years ago they just thought people 
were skanks.

830
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,680
There are no gangs have actually like 
terrible diseases,

831
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,420
male and female.
I'm just thinking and just in general,

832
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:15,490
like uh,
you know,

833
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,390
things that we hear here,
take some Prozac and then no,

834
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:24,540
don't take any PROZAC.
Just changing their minds about every 

835
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,020
thing that they put in.
You are polite of you,

836
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,550
that's for sure.
That's for sure.

837
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:28,330
True.
So,

838
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,020
you know,
I,

839
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:34,170
I stopped,
I want to do more what you were doing 

840
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,020
with the actually spinning out your own 
stem cells.

841
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,860
There's a couple of different procedures
that they're doing now.

842
00:40:38,861 --> 00:40:43,861
One of them that's really important as 
they're shooting stem cells directly 

843
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:45,410
into disc tissue,
so people that have bulging discs in my,

844
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:50,490
they're able to heal the discs and 
actually create more disc tissue and 

845
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,120
this is all super cutting edge stuff 
with the stem cell technologies,

846
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:58,060
some of the most intriguing and 
fascinating things going on right now in

847
00:40:58,061 --> 00:40:58,930
modern medicine.

848
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,660
So they're,
they're able to do amazing work.

849
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,170
I mean,
it's just,

850
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,800
they think that within a few years 
they're going to be able to fix things.

851
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,560
Here's one thing they're doing.
This is really important for people.

852
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:13,561
I better not forget this,
when the used to blow out things like 

853
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:15,220
acl,
they used to have to replace it.

854
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:20,250
They used to either replace it with a 
cadaver ligament or they would replace 

855
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:20,440
it with,
um,

856
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,800
your Pete Patella tendon.
That would cut a piece of that like I 

857
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,780
had that done.
Or they would take your hamstring.

858
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:28,930
Sometimes they take a chunk of your 
hamstring and they screw it in place.

859
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:33,010
Now they have a new method real knew 
where they can actually.

860
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,980
They've figured out a way to

861
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,980
repair the actual acl itself.
They figured out how to tie it back 

862
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,890
together again in heals.
It heals way quicker.

863
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,160
You're walking almost instantly like 
after the surgery and you're back to 

864
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,630
action in three months.
It's a totally different ballgame.

865
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,960
They had this guy who competed in the 
Olympics five months after getting the 

866
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,581
surgery on his Achilles.
He blew out his Achilles and he used to 

867
00:42:00,581 --> 00:42:02,630
be like,
instantaneously your leg was useless and

868
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:07,631
it was useless for like a year.
Now this guy is five months later is 

869
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:09,260
competing in the Olympics and they're 
shooting stem cells in there to help the

870
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:11,480
healing.
It's fucking crazy what's going on right

871
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:13,910
now that's not.
We're living in an awesome time.

872
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:18,970
Yeah.
I mean for a guy like Hickson who has 

873
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:18,970
all those back problems,
man,

874
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:19,730
this is.
Let's get them on that.

875
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,960
I know,
right?

876
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,080
Yeah.
I think Hixon is all like holistic 

877
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,080
though.
You know,

878
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,350
he wants to just do yoga and ride off 
into the sunset on somebody like a pale 

879
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:30,750
horse or some shit.
Yeah,

880
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:32,060
yeah,
yeah.

881
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:37,061
Like meditate on something where they 
light it on fire and that's how he's 

882
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:37,061
going to go out.
You know what?

883
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:37,061
I mean,

884
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:43,910
I don't know how much he's into getting 
a bunch of stuff shot into him.

885
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,540
I mean,
I think I admire that a lot of ways.

886
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:53,620
I mean,
he's a fascinating character and he's 

887
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:53,620
the guy,
in my opinion,

888
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,610
that opened up a lot of people's eyes to
yoga from that choke documentary.

889
00:42:56,611 --> 00:42:57,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

890
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,880
People saw that and they were like,
oh wait a minute.

891
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,120
Yeah.
The baddest motherfucker on earth does 

892
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,120
yoga.
Does Yoga.

893
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,210
Yeah.
And when you see what he can do with his

894
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:06,810
body,
like,

895
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,190
oh,
well of course.

896
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,060
How are you going to hold onto that guy?
Look,

897
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,540
look at how we can move.
Yeah.

898
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:17,310
Could you stand up on a balance beam and
do a full split holding his foot over 

899
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,630
his head and he's 40.
You know,

900
00:43:18,631 --> 00:43:20,730
at the time he was.
Now he's in his fifties.

901
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,640
He's amazing.
Quite a quite a fascinating guy,

902
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:27,930
but not interested in getting shot up 
with stem cells.

903
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,960
I am.
Sign me up.

904
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,620
I don't know.
I don't have problems with my acl.

905
00:43:34,621 --> 00:43:36,340
I just want to do it.
Let's just do it.

906
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,120
Just do it.
Shoot it in there,

907
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,080
shoot it everywhere.
That what happens,

908
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,350
some people go down to Mexico and they 
get it shot into their veins.

909
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,570
That Dan Bilzerian Guy,
you know,

910
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:47,040
that guy is the uh,
Internet.

911
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:47,880
Uh,
he's,

912
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:50,010
he's hilarious.
I've had him on the podcast before.

913
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:55,490
He's a poker player and he has been so 
famous from being this like Internet guy

914
00:43:56,551 --> 00:44:01,551
with a ton of money that flies around in
jets and has all these hot chicks with 

915
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:01,950
him.
He's always like shooting guns,

916
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,770
driving Dune buggies and shit.
He goes down to Mexico all the time.

917
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:06,960
It gets a shot in his veins 
intravenously.

918
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:07,860
And I'm like,
well,

919
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:08,910
what does it do for you?
He's like,

920
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:10,120
I don't know.
I feel fucking great.

921
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,450
Great.
No good.

922
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:17,390
Is it bad?
No one exactly knows.

923
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:22,460
Right?
But they take stem cells and they just 

924
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:22,530
got electrolytes.
They launching and in you intervene boss

925
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:24,800
route and said he did it.
He felt like he had power coming.

926
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:25,050
He

927
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,270
lies.
It was like I had light coming out of my

928
00:44:27,271 --> 00:44:28,180
hands like that.

929
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,680
Like the first time you did meth.
Okay.

930
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,760
No,
I think it's better than that.

931
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,230
Okay.
Do better than that.

932
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,630
Meth and ecstasy together.
All right.

933
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,480
It's like a little like your energetic,
but you're also loving.

934
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,290
I think there's something to,
uh,

935
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:49,390
what we're doing right now where I think
within the next 20 or 30 years we're 

936
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,210
going to have a real,
real problem with people not dying.

937
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,170
GRANDPA.
Now with the current administration,

938
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:58,000
I think it could be all right with that.
Do you think that motherfucker,

939
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:03,020
he so ego maniacal.
Don't you think you'd be shooting stem 

940
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:03,020
cells into himself and tries to keep 
himself alive forever?

941
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:07,820
Yeah,
but he's going to send anybody else off 

942
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,310
to go fight for the materials that go 
into those shots.

943
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,580
Madge,
you trump found out about it before 

944
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,310
anybody started reverse aging.
Like Benjamin buttons would be amazing.

945
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,320
Just all of a sudden trump is like 
younger again,

946
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,360
kind of freaking everybody out.
We know he's 90,

947
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,140
but he looks great.
Yeah.

948
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,920
As long as he goes all the way down and 
we can put them over your knee and like 

949
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:25,920
a baby.
Give him a time out.

950
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:28,000
What do you think he's going to happen 
with this dude?

951
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,410
Um,
I think it's a smokescreen.

952
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,600
I think there's so many other things 
going on that,

953
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:36,490
uh,
that we're not paying attention to,

954
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,710
but it is a testament to,
um,

955
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:45,210
just,
just the level of frustrations I think 

956
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,000
that people have had just with 
government in general and the Internet 

957
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:52,540
and social media has been able to 
polarize us all enough to where we don't

958
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,190
talk to each other to really sort of 
sought out some of the,

959
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,010
you know,
the actual issues that are going on.

960
00:45:57,011 --> 00:46:02,011
So they had this,
this spectacle I'm going on right now 

961
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:04,710
that,
uh,

962
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:06,760
it's,
it's amazing.

963
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:13,300
It is a spectacle,
but I always wonder whether or not it's 

964
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,191
an orchestra orchestrated spectacle or 
whether we just try to find patterns 

965
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:16,170
when patterns don't even exist.
And what it really is,

966
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:21,171
is just,
this is just a goofy dude who loves 

967
00:46:21,171 --> 00:46:25,061
attention and we have a fucking 
popularity contest to see who runs the 

968
00:46:25,061 --> 00:46:25,620
country and you get,
like I say,

969
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,200
go back,
just back it up

970
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,160
to see where people really frustrated 
with the Obama administration.

971
00:46:30,161 --> 00:46:32,260
Were they frustrated with the Bush 
administration?

972
00:46:32,261 --> 00:46:33,500
Whether you know,
whether is it,

973
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,960
is it connected or are they just looking
for something different?

974
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:42,990
Because if you look historically at at 
places that have had some success as a 

975
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,190
country and then they have some 
problems,

976
00:46:45,191 --> 00:46:50,191
we started seeing some issues and 
they're just whatever the incumbent a 

977
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,660
person is a,
the party,

978
00:46:52,661 --> 00:46:56,080
the group I'm all they want is something
else.

979
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:57,930
Something different.
We want to get rid of that,

980
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,150
but something different in and 
historically when that happens,

981
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:06,720
shit just go sideways that just pick it.
They just wanted anything else and they 

982
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,080
got exactly what they got.
Something worse.

983
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:08,900
Worse.

984
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:15,170
Yeah.
That's the problem is worrying about it 

985
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:15,170
the same way you worried about 
technology.

986
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:19,311
Like one guy can one day create one 
thing and it fucking ruins everything 

987
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:20,400
and you almost feel like that with like 
a president.

988
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:25,430
Like we can ask for something different 
and then one day we get it and it 

989
00:47:25,561 --> 00:47:29,620
fucking ruins everything like that.
What I worry about is

990
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,980
a lot of what he's doing with this 
battle against the intelligence 

991
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,220
agencies,
all the shitty talks about them.

992
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:41,530
It's like if they start hiding stuff 
from him because they're worried that 

993
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:42,140
he's going to tell stuff to Russian guys
and you know,

994
00:47:42,141 --> 00:47:47,141
and talk about certain things like he 
revealed top secret information about 

995
00:47:47,141 --> 00:47:51,090
isis wants to use laptops is bombed.
He told the Russians that if they can't 

996
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:54,850
trust him and if they developed this 
thing where it's them versus him.

997
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,840
Did you gotta you got a real serious 
problem on your hands that.

998
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:03,841
Because that's gonna that attitude's 
going to carry onto the next 

999
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:06,210
administration,
whether it's pants or some Democrat or 

1000
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:06,210
whoever the fuck comes in after him.

1001
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:08,410
Right?
Fuck man.

1002
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:09,230
It's all scary.

1003
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,840
It's just people didn't know what they 
were voting for.

1004
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,960
They didn't understand.
They thought they thought it was going 

1005
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:16,960
to be.
We're going to drain the swamp.

1006
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,630
Like this motherfucker just,
he just backed up the biggest sewer 

1007
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:24,620
truck ever to the swamp and he's shit in
there like crazy.

1008
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,120
Yeah.

1009
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:26,280
Well I,
you know,

1010
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,310
I agree,
but I think the,

1011
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:33,120
the,
the all again y'all.

1012
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:36,610
All we can do I think is to step back 
and fight.

1013
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,590
Fight the battle.
So here,

1014
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:43,591
you know,
if you can think of the battlefield as 

1015
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:43,591
being your,
your old school,

1016
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:44,170
uh,
you know,

1017
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,950
there's the goals over there.
Capture the flag kind of battlefield.

1018
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,480
Your first battle is his ignorance.
Your first enemy is ignorance.

1019
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:56,320
Trying to figure out how to get past the
misinformation that you know,

1020
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,660
all that stuff.
Just to get past ignorance.

1021
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,890
It,
educate yourself.

1022
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:02,380
First of all,
the earth is not flat.

1023
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:07,620
You don't think there it's flat.
I think we need to see a rock from the 

1024
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,250
sky slam into the earth.
I think that's what we need.

1025
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,180
We need like a small European city wiped
out just so we go,

1026
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,440
oh,
oh,

1027
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:15,470
okay,
well this is,

1028
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,650
this is crazy.
What are we concentrating on?

1029
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:20,510
Bullshit.
Goddamn shooting gallery art.

1030
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:25,540
Life is just so short.
We don't understand the real spans of 

1031
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:25,540
time.
Right?

1032
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:30,270
We don't understand that periodically.
This fucking whole thing's going to get 

1033
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:30,270
rattled.
Yes.

1034
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,480
Extremely.
No doubt about it.

1035
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,200
It's coming.

1036
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:34,360
Yeah.
So I think that's,

1037
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,260
you know,
it's idle,

1038
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:37,790
you know,
idle hands are the devil's playground.

1039
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,920
You've heard that cliche and I think 
that really is,

1040
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,330
you know.
Um,

1041
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,520
so my prepper,
that prepper side of me is that person 

1042
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:48,520
who,
you know,

1043
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,260
what if we don't have,
what if you don't have electricity for a

1044
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,930
week because whatever,
for whatever reason,

1045
00:49:53,931 --> 00:49:54,830
why,
yeah,

1046
00:49:54,831 --> 00:49:55,300
just,
you know,

1047
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,280
just be having an understanding of what 
that is.

1048
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:01,910
Um,
so that one is just a starter,

1049
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,250
a precursor or just a,
a,

1050
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:09,340
a dry run of what,
what happens when that rock does fall 

1051
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,670
from the sky because it happens all the 
time because,

1052
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,760
you know,
historically historically of happens a 

1053
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:15,760
lot.
Uh,

1054
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,410
and I do believe that that is the,
that would be the,

1055
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:23,000
that would be the reset button.
I prefer not to have that be the reset,

1056
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:28,001
but I'd prefer to,
their consciousness caught up with 

1057
00:50:28,001 --> 00:50:28,070
itself and we just kind of start to each
other.

1058
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,470
I would like that too,
but I think we need something.

1059
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:35,910
Maybe a little shake them up.
Maybe it doesn't even have to hit a 

1060
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:38,591
city.
Like how about hit the ocean and we 

1061
00:50:38,591 --> 00:50:40,691
catch it on video.
Just bone mile high waves wipes out all 

1062
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,610
of Carbon Beach Malibu.
Come on,

1063
00:50:43,611 --> 00:50:45,560
son,
all those billion dollar,

1064
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,620
they call that billionaire beach.
He's fucking assholes.

1065
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:51,560
They would only work.
It would only work if it,

1066
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,330
if it was a global event,
right?

1067
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:58,520
Because if it's isolated,
because we've had tsunamis so large,

1068
00:50:58,550 --> 00:50:59,660
we don't care.
Large cities,

1069
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,510
nobody.
Nobody does anything about it.

1070
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:04,160
It would have to be.
We had Katrina that,

1071
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:09,161
but that's down there with those people.
It needs to be something that's 

1072
00:51:09,161 --> 00:51:13,490
nationwide that that hits all of us at 
the same time where we stopped with this

1073
00:51:13,491 --> 00:51:18,491
bullshit,
stop with this polarized bullshit and 

1074
00:51:18,491 --> 00:51:18,491
start talking to each other.
This is what happens.

1075
00:51:18,491 --> 00:51:20,690
Connor connects with the lefthand and 
floyd methods when made,

1076
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:25,691
whether it's Chin Floyd goes down and at
the count of eight when he's about to 

1077
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:30,461
get up,
the whole arena gets hit with a media 

1078
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:33,820
boom.
Last Vegas is wiped off the face of the 

1079
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:33,920
planet.
Everybody's dead,

1080
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,980
but we saw the feed up until the 
asteroid impact it.

1081
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:41,981
Just one big bright spark of light,
but then everybody starts tuning into 

1082
00:51:41,981 --> 00:51:45,250
CNN.
There's a huge crater where vegas used 

1083
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,291
to be,
and the asteroid though has an emp that 

1084
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:49,901
hits every single fee that goes to every
single camera and TV and it wipes out 

1085
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:52,300
every electronic device that's been 
watching the whole thing now.

1086
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:55,460
Now you're getting too crazy.
Wait a minute.

1087
00:51:55,461 --> 00:51:57,260
That's.
Can we just need to wipe out?

1088
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,690
They helped me out here.
We don't even need to wipe out Vegas.

1089
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:01,010
I Love Vegas.
Don't get me wrong.

1090
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:04,160
Yeah.
I just feel like we need something where

1091
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:05,720
people are,
they have to.

1092
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:08,300
It has to affect them.
It has to affect them on some level.

1093
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:09,380
That actually the

1094
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:14,110
kickstarts their compassion gene.
You're,

1095
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:19,140
you know,
you want to have a balance between your 

1096
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:19,140
survival gene and your compassion Jane,
because you know,

1097
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,680
you got to figure back a long time ago.
The thing that,

1098
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:27,860
that,
that helped us be here today is we 

1099
00:52:30,211 --> 00:52:31,410
weren't,
we weren't stronger.

1100
00:52:31,411 --> 00:52:33,540
We weren't faster,
uh,

1101
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:39,050
than we are.
We weren't larger than the things that 

1102
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:39,050
we're eating us.
We had to be smarter.

1103
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:43,221
We have to be clever.
We had to come up with ways to create 

1104
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:47,150
something from nothing to be able to 
defend ourselves against predators or 

1105
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:48,930
refinanced,
so that creative,

1106
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:52,920
that creative juice was there and we 
were trying to,

1107
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,750
we were establishing food,
shelter,

1108
00:52:54,751 --> 00:52:59,190
and clothing as well as keeping 
protected from predators.

1109
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:04,790
And it was that creative side of us,
that artistic side of us that actually 

1110
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,770
was too.
That's what you have to think that,

1111
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:11,850
that creative side of us to keep us 
ahead of these creatures,

1112
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:13,720
the elements,
um,

1113
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,290
all these things.
And as time has gone on,

1114
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:18,480
when you no longer are threatened by 
these things,

1115
00:53:18,481 --> 00:53:20,460
there's no,
there's plenty of clothes everywhere.

1116
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,820
Pretty much plenty of food everywhere 
where we live and a lot of idle hands,

1117
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,280
idle hands.
So we've lost

1118
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,970
touch with that imminent threats.
So we have,

1119
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,290
we started to turn on each other,
all those girls with fake assets.

1120
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,500
People get mad.
I'm mad that he has a lady.

1121
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,890
What's her name?
It gives you.

1122
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,560
I was eating all these people angry at 
her because there were assets,

1123
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:43,980
fat,
angry,

1124
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,800
just angry at a fake ass.
Well,

1125
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:51,150
they don't even have a mic rib here at 
the Mcdonald's Arizona.

1126
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,170
Keep them big.
Rib Eye had 12 seasons.

1127
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,230
That's.
No,

1128
00:53:55,410 --> 00:54:00,410
no,
no disrespect to the people that they 

1129
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:00,420
get caught up in that broken nail 
syndrome,

1130
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:02,310
but like that is what it is.
That's your,

1131
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:07,490
your tragedies are not tragedies.
So we need some kind of life threatening

1132
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:12,960
something that's really global and it's.
It crosses religious,

1133
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:15,150
economic,
social,

1134
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:17,880
racial.
It has to cross all those lines to where

1135
00:54:17,881 --> 00:54:20,730
people are like,
what the fuck?

1136
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:25,970
Yeah.
It has to expose micro aggressions for 

1137
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:25,970
the preposterous notion that there 
really are.

1138
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,730
Like if you get hit in the head with a 
media,

1139
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,990
someone gets mad at a microaggression.
There's,

1140
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,280
there are two very different things.
You see that meter almost hit him.

1141
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,100
Okay.
Let me see.

1142
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,570
The meter almost hit her.
Yeah.

1143
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,690
CIS gendered piece of Shit.

1144
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,130
Living with all those cowboys and 
Arizona.

1145
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,270
Yeah,
whatever,

1146
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:49,740
Bro.
I'm a big fan,

1147
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:51,960
Arizona.
Some of my favorite people.

1148
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:54,180
If there is any one of my bathrooms,
feel free.

1149
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,650
Thank you.
That's sweet.

1150
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,510
Do you.
Do you have a restaurant there too?

1151
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,220
Yeah,
we just opened a North Korea,

1152
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:01,200
so fuck.
Do you have time for all this?

1153
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,290
I don't do it myself.
Okay.

1154
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:08,340
That's the planet.
I get it all going and then I hand that 

1155
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:08,340
off to Austin people.
That's a good move.

1156
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,980
So Jesse and creator curator of also 
we're running that thing.

1157
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,080
Um,
uh,

1158
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,060
Brianna a,
it's a Alstroemeria.

1159
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,440
So what is Austria a basically a wine 
bar with,

1160
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:19,610
with food.
So it's a,

1161
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,120
you know,
a gathering place where you're like,

1162
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,340
that place I'm going to in studio city?
Yes.

1163
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,830
What's that place called?
Augustine wine bar.

1164
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:26,910
God Damn,
that was good.

1165
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,620
Yeah,
the food was amazing to.

1166
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,580
Yes.
Awesome.

1167
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:31,260
Matthew Caner,
wonderful place.

1168
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,210
It brought up some like 19,
21.

1169
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,050
Oh yeah,
we did some.

1170
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:38,260
We did you.
He raped me that night.

1171
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,020
Not Financially.
Yes.

1172
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:45,050
Financially and it wasn't my idea.
I didn't know how to spend that much 

1173
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:45,050
money.
I don't know what kind of wine that was,

1174
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,610
but it was fascinating wine that was 
like,

1175
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,750
Ooh,
this is wine.

1176
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,150
Yeah,
I kinda got it for a brief moment.

1177
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:54,060
Yeah.
And then I wandered off on some tangent.

1178
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,610
I think I actually said I think as like,
hey,

1179
00:55:56,611 --> 00:55:59,880
set up a fight with me and bordain the 
you wanted to fight somebody.

1180
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:03,680
I don't think it was important to.
One day might kill you,

1181
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:04,800
dude.
I was pretty drunk.

1182
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:08,280
He's crazy and he's got the crazy gene 
for sure.

1183
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:13,281
He's got that.
I used to be a former heroin addict and 

1184
00:56:13,281 --> 00:56:13,281
almost died.
Jean,

1185
00:56:13,281 --> 00:56:16,960
you know,
it'll only gets activated and people 

1186
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:16,960
that have been to the brink of death.
Yeah,

1187
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,850
I've met a bunch of people like that 
though.

1188
00:56:17,851 --> 00:56:20,900
I think it's a real thing.
I think there's something that happens.

1189
00:56:20,901 --> 00:56:23,060
There's some scary people like Matt 
Brown,

1190
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,130
the guy who fights in the UFC,

1191
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,840
same kind of gene.
He's got that.

1192
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,430
I used to die.
I died,

1193
00:56:27,431 --> 00:56:28,300
but I came back.
Jean,

1194
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,950
I met him.
He's really Nice Guy,

1195
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,950
a nice guy,
but there's that edge of like,

1196
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:38,070
I think maybe they've been to the dark 
lands when people have been to the dark 

1197
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:39,040
men's,
they come back different.

1198
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:41,560
So like Stephen King's pet cemetery,
you know,

1199
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:43,620
you barely the cat comes back to life 
and it's like,

1200
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,250
okay,
bring the cat back.

1201
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:47,290
So fuck.
Don't fuck with that cat.

1202
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:51,020
That is something that happens to people
when they've been to the darklands yeah.

1203
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:52,260
Yeah.
So the listeria,

1204
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:56,710
it's Arizona grows its own wheat,
so all of our breads are from Arizona.

1205
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:57,280
Wait.
Oh,

1206
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:58,120
okay.
Let me ask you.

1207
00:56:58,121 --> 00:56:58,530
This.
Is,

1208
00:56:58,531 --> 00:57:00,520
that is.
Can you please not do that?

1209
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:02,530
We're talking Jimmy,
Jimmy,

1210
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:04,150
Phil.
This is a new,

1211
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:07,660
a Jimi Hendrix poster that we have.
If you notice in the background folks,

1212
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,160
because the old one was not really his 
mugshot.

1213
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,060
The new one is actually his mugshot.
So we had it swapped out.

1214
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:20,860
This is the real Jimi Hendrix mugshot 
thing.

1215
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:24,550
Broke fix that.
Don't worry about it folks.

1216
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:29,580
We're going to be fun.
Is it true about wheat that there are 

1217
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:33,901
strains that are wild or a rather 
unmodified that are much more easy for 

1218
00:57:34,901 --> 00:57:38,530
the body to digest?
So Hayden Mills is one of the many,

1219
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:43,570
uh,
down in Phoenix that are actually 

1220
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:43,570
milling the local waste.
So they're looking,

1221
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:47,290
they're basically cultivating a around 
southern Arizona heirloom weight and 

1222
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,780
that's the idea they're going back to.
Uh,

1223
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:55,080
the problem with that,
of course it's always got to get the 

1224
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,400
give and take is that those heirloom 
pure heirloom wheats to have far less 

1225
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:00,460
complex glutens and um,
uh,

1226
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:03,820
and there's far they don't produce as 
much wheat,

1227
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,640
so just your production on an acre of 
land is,

1228
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:10,210
is significantly lower for this stuff,
but it's tastier,

1229
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,740
it has more nutrients.

1230
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:18,240
And then from there,
the next step of course is people 

1231
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,560
understanding a time.
So you're,

1232
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,490
you're taking that wheat,
you're mailing it,

1233
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:24,850
and then when you go to make your bread,
any kind of fermentation in that,

1234
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,970
that you're getting your,
your,

1235
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:29,830
uh,
inoculating that to make your bread,

1236
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,190
that sitting,
letting this dose it overnight,

1237
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:38,730
you're letting it rise for a longer 
period of time because that whole 

1238
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:42,090
process is breaking down those glutens.
Oh,

1239
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,800
okay.
So my sourdough bread is free.

1240
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:49,060
So because most commercial commercial 
bread,

1241
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:50,870
the fermentation,
you know,

1242
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,600
the rising that doe is,
is,

1243
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:55,090
is almost instantaneous and it goes 
right into the oven.

1244
00:58:55,091 --> 00:58:57,370
And then people are not chewing their 
food,

1245
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:02,371
they're just cramming it in.
And it's probably coming from places 

1246
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:07,021
that are doing a lot of pesticides and 
all the extra stuff that's going on 

1247
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:07,270
those,
those crops.

1248
00:59:07,271 --> 00:59:12,271
So the heirloom wheat movement ends up 
tying hand in hand in hand with,

1249
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,170
with understanding the slow food 
movement.

1250
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,510
Take,
take your minute,

1251
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:25,020
chew your food,
understanding where your food comes 

1252
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:25,580
from,
try to get it organic and local.

1253
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,400
Um,
and it goes,

1254
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:29,960
that goes all the way back to the wheat.
So yes.

1255
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:31,340
So there.
So to answer your question,

1256
00:59:31,341 --> 00:59:32,040
yeah,
the,

1257
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:37,450
what happened is they over world war one
to try and make sure that people are 

1258
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:41,100
going to be fed during those wars.
They were manipulating the wheat so that

1259
00:59:41,101 --> 00:59:44,420
it was much higher production weight.
But now the flavor's gone.

1260
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:46,410
The nutrition's not there,
uh,

1261
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:51,110
it being resistant to all these things 
that all the glutens are very complex.

1262
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:54,530
And then so when you were actually big 
and making the bread out of these things

1263
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:59,090
are making positives out of them,
it's just there's all this extra crap,

1264
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:04,350
you know,
if you created a Frankenstein's monster 

1265
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,371
with this wheat.
So your body of course is reacting to 

1266
01:00:06,371 --> 01:00:09,191
all those things that have nothing to do
with actually having bread or having 

1267
01:00:09,191 --> 01:00:09,191
wheat.
It's a very controversial.

1268
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:14,420
A lot of people try to claim that there 
is no difference between the we'd have 

1269
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:18,081
today and the weight of the past and 
they also try to claim that the only 

1270
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:19,620
people that have issues with gluten are 
people that have gluten sensitivity,

1271
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,720
celiac disease,
things along those lines.

1272
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:25,320
And My,
my gripe with that is that I always feel

1273
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:28,770
that the people that say that they don't
have a good sense of their body,

1274
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:32,430
I don't think they're real athletes 
because I think when you talk to a real.

1275
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:37,620
I'm not saying that you can't perform 
like a real world class athlete by 

1276
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,040
eating pasta.
You definitely can.

1277
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,670
What I think is we want to talk about 
total optimization.

1278
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:45,750
If you want to talk about your body like
running as smoothly as possible.

1279
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:50,780
For me at least,
I notice a difference between eating a 

1280
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,531
lot of bread and gluten,
which I used to do a lot and not doing 

1281
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:54,531
it.

1282
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:56,130
When I don't do it,
I just feel better.

1283
01:00:56,131 --> 01:01:01,131
I have more energy,
I feel like my body's struggles less 

1284
01:01:01,131 --> 01:01:02,520
digestive food and I don't have the big 
crash after the food is over.

1285
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:04,230
It doesn't mean that I can't perform on 
it.

1286
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,570
Like I don't have a gluten sensitivity 
issue.

1287
01:01:06,571 --> 01:01:08,580
Like I can eat it.
It's not,

1288
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:09,900
that's not the problem.
If someone said,

1289
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:10,590
oh,
you're fine,

1290
01:01:10,591 --> 01:01:11,910
you eat it.
It's no big deal.

1291
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,560
It's not that.
It's no big deal.

1292
01:01:13,561 --> 01:01:15,600
I don't think it's the optimal thing to 
do.

1293
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,860
I just think that it's delicious.
I don't think it's killing me,

1294
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,750
but I don't think if you want to give 
your body the very best fuel pasta,

1295
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:29,870
like regular pasta isn't that fuel,
but I wonder if you can get some of that

1296
01:01:30,451 --> 01:01:33,150
heirloom pasta if you would notice a 
difference.

1297
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:35,820
I wonder if you would feel the 
difference in trying the two.

1298
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,960
Okay.
So similar conversation parallel.

1299
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:41,880
You're in,
you're in Italy,

1300
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:44,640
you're having bottles of wine,
you're having gender.

1301
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,950
Uh,
it tastes great.

1302
01:01:46,951 --> 01:01:48,720
You had a good time,
you woke up the next day,

1303
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,590
he didn't have a hangover.
All those things over here.

1304
01:01:52,591 --> 01:01:57,591
I have wine and I get hangovers and I 
get sick and I do those things and it's 

1305
01:01:57,591 --> 01:02:01,981
like,
so it must be that the Italian wine is 

1306
01:02:01,981 --> 01:02:02,120
better or has less sulfites or something
like that was like,

1307
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:05,250
well,
most likely what it was is over here.

1308
01:02:05,251 --> 01:02:10,251
You're a fat pig and you sat in your 
house and you drank a bottle of wine 

1309
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:14,511
with your buddies without taking a walk 
in a foreign country because you're 

1310
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:18,861
walking to your restaurant there,
you're having food and you're eating 

1311
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:21,480
over the course of three hours with your
friends and you're eating food with your

1312
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:23,340
wine.
You're eating less of it.

1313
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,520
Most likely it has a lower alcohol 
content because it's meant to go with 

1314
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,181
food rather than being this mountain dew
with alcohol in it that you get out of 

1315
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:32,320
California,
you know,

1316
01:02:32,321 --> 01:02:35,450
it's.
It's all for one ones that I did not.

1317
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,950
I did not all for California,
Arizona thing we're going on.

1318
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:41,850
Right,
and maybe you're fucked.

1319
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:43,500
You're fucked.
Okay.

1320
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:48,590
Good to know.
So I think there's an experiential thing

1321
01:02:49,621 --> 01:02:54,621
that's happening with those 
conversations and it's the same thing 

1322
01:02:54,621 --> 01:02:55,830
with the pasta.
Pasta makes me feel sluggish.

1323
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,170
You eight,
17 pounds of it,

1324
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,810
right?
Don't eat 17 pounds of it,

1325
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:04,230
but yes,
going back to having just the initiation

1326
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:07,830
of like understanding the conversation 
of heirloom wheat and understanding that

1327
01:03:07,831 --> 01:03:10,680
there's a difference.
Arguing that there is a difference.

1328
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,980
Even if there isn't now you're looking 
at it.

1329
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,680
Maybe you're having less of it.
Maybe you're,

1330
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:21,710
maybe you're portioning out better and 
you're paying attention to your diet 

1331
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:21,710
more.
Hey,

1332
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:23,310
that's a step in the right direction.
Absolutely.

1333
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,980
Yeah.
I read something about the French.

1334
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:30,050
The French are always eating bread,
but they do have that older wheat bread 

1335
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,580
and they eat a lot of fats with their 
bread,

1336
01:03:31,581 --> 01:03:36,581
like it's constantly with butter and oil
and they cook with a lot of butter and 

1337
01:03:36,581 --> 01:03:38,390
oil in that,
those carbs in that oil together.

1338
01:03:38,391 --> 01:03:41,420
Apparently it's just a better fit for 
your digestive system.

1339
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,530
I could,
I could see that.

1340
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:45,350
I kind of did that.
I didn't stick to it.

1341
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,740
Letter of the law,
but I did a little bit of Kenogenic Diet

1342
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,870
for a minute where I cut out sugars,
carbs,

1343
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:52,640
all those things.
Just feel,

1344
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:56,780
uh,
I felt a lot better a right away now.

1345
01:03:56,810 --> 01:04:01,810
Now I go back and I'll have some pasta 
once or twice a month in small portions.

1346
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:05,120
I'll have some bread,
but I don't eat a lot of it.

1347
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:07,340
I enjoy it better now more.
It's not you.

1348
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,720
It's a treat.
It's a treat.

1349
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,480
It's enough,
you know that at that point like,

1350
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:17,080
you know,
proteins and vegetables are the staple 

1351
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:17,840
and I have,
I have treats now.

1352
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,590
Yeah.
I feel the exact same way.

1353
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:23,970
I feel like I have my nutrition which is
like I try to eat really healthy food 80

1354
01:04:23,971 --> 01:04:27,660
percent of the time and then 20 percent 
of the time I like to go to a restaurant

1355
01:04:27,661 --> 01:04:29,340
and get linguine with clams.
You know,

1356
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:31,320
it's just,
it's just an experience.

1357
01:04:31,321 --> 01:04:34,170
It's a delicious experience.
I know it's not the best thing for me,

1358
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,250
but it's a treat.

1359
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:35,850
Yeah.
You're,

1360
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:36,950
you,
you know,

1361
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,270
this is,
you get one life,

1362
01:04:38,271 --> 01:04:39,080
so let's enjoy it.

1363
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:40,480
Also,
especially like what you're doing,

1364
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:42,580
like having,
when you have a restaurant,

1365
01:04:42,581 --> 01:04:44,770
I mean you're selling an experience,
right?

1366
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:48,760
Like it's just delicious wines and 
delicious foods.

1367
01:04:48,761 --> 01:04:51,280
And the two of them together with 
conversation and saw that,

1368
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:52,030
you know,
and you're like,

1369
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:52,990
oh,
try this,

1370
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,500
try this,
you know,

1371
01:04:53,501 --> 01:04:58,501
like when people are doing that and it's
like this whole sensory experience is 

1372
01:04:58,501 --> 01:04:59,860
all combined together.
It's not just about nutrition,

1373
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:03,880
it's about the art of creating this 
sensory experience.

1374
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:06,260
One could argue that your,
your wellbeing,

1375
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,550
uh,
is,

1376
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:13,740
is you're,
you're actually increasing your life 

1377
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,540
experience here and your and your 
quality of life by having this 

1378
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:17,980
experience with these people,
these wines that you

1379
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,790
actually feel better tomorrow and next 
week because of that interaction because

1380
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:26,791
of that short,
even though like that's straight butter 

1381
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:26,791
and that's straight,
you know?

1382
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:27,580
Yeah.
And wine.

1383
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:29,560
But no,
I think you're 100 percent right.

1384
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:35,130
I think that's a,
that's sort of an overlooked aspect of 

1385
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,400
health is that positive experiences.
And,

1386
01:05:36,401 --> 01:05:40,540
and just also like when you go to a 
really good restaurant and especially if

1387
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:42,160
you get to meet the cook,
you know,

1388
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:43,780
like you meet someone to cook something 
for you,

1389
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:48,781
you can say thank you and you have this 
like cool feedback with the person who 

1390
01:05:48,781 --> 01:05:51,721
made your food.
It's like there's something going on 

1391
01:05:51,721 --> 01:05:51,721
there,
it's like this exchange,

1392
01:05:51,721 --> 01:05:52,150
it's,
and it's,

1393
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,940
it's like a sand castle and the way it's
beautiful,

1394
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:58,570
it's amazing how the fucking the skill 
involved in creating it,

1395
01:05:58,571 --> 01:06:00,230
but then it's going to go away.
You know,

1396
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:00,940
it's gone.
It's,

1397
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:03,760
it was a temporary experience and in 
this world of,

1398
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:09,150
you know,
the NSA stockpiling text messages and 

1399
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:10,840
Dick Pics and some fucking warehouse in 
Utah,

1400
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:13,640
you know,
we lost it is,

1401
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:16,420
it is.
They've got to address,

1402
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:19,510
I don't know the address.
If I known that I wouldn't give it out,

1403
01:06:19,511 --> 01:06:24,511
they'd come get me,
come get you and tell you now we're 

1404
01:06:24,511 --> 01:06:25,900
doubling down on your Dick Pics and 
they've got a fucking warehouse.

1405
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:30,930
Gigantic like costco filled with 
slightly bigger warehouse but a bigger 

1406
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,360
fucking Irish.

1407
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:37,830
Yeah.
I,

1408
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:40,870
I think um,
I mean in the concerts too,

1409
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:45,871
right?
Like live concerts or kind of that way 

1410
01:06:45,871 --> 01:06:45,871
too,
right?

1411
01:06:45,871 --> 01:06:48,631
Like that's a temporary experience.
I mean there's one thing to listen to a 

1412
01:06:48,631 --> 01:06:51,991
song that you have on your phone.
You can listen to it over and over 

1413
01:06:51,991 --> 01:06:54,121
again,
but when you're going to see a live 

1414
01:06:54,121 --> 01:06:55,030
concert,
you're experiencing the guy like onstage

1415
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:58,600
sing that song.
You're experiencing the sound coming out

1416
01:06:58,601 --> 01:06:59,860
of the guitar.
Right?

1417
01:06:59,861 --> 01:07:02,110
When the guys touching the cords,
that's why this.

1418
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:07,260
That's why this stuff annoys me.
The phones at the shows because I'm a 

1419
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,970
firm believer in oral tradition.
I feel like I'm a firm believer.

1420
01:07:09,971 --> 01:07:13,120
I just.
I embrace the storytelling.

1421
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:18,150
I embraced that whole tradition of oral 
tradition and being able to describe to 

1422
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:20,530
your friends that sitting around that,
you know,

1423
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:25,540
fire after a good,
long day of hunting will you tell the 

1424
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,861
story of the hunt and do all those 
things and those and those family 

1425
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:28,861
stories and other,
you know,

1426
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:33,780
your grandfather and your great 
grandfather's father's stories are told 

1427
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,010
in that setting and you have to remember
that there's.

1428
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,530
You're not reading it down.
It's,

1429
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:39,310
it's a.
it's a tradition of of understanding the

1430
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:44,311
details of being able to explain and 
expand on the details from what your 

1431
01:07:44,831 --> 01:07:49,831
recollection of what you saw,
but if you have no skills of absorbing 

1432
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:53,551
what you saw,
if you rely on this thing to capture 

1433
01:07:53,551 --> 01:07:54,280
their stories for you,
first of all,

1434
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:59,310
nothing you're going to get at a show is
going to be represented that represent 

1435
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:00,610
what you just saw or what you were there
for.

1436
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,790
I guess as a postcard,
I suppose it works,

1437
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:08,791
but like it's not state presidents day 
with these people to be there for this 

1438
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:14,570
thing that's far more important and you 
know also as critical.

1439
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:16,070
Maybe the behind you would like

1440
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:19,610
to be that person who's willing to sell 
that and now your shit's in their way.

1441
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:23,340
Some people hold up fucking ipads.
There's 12 inch ipad,

1442
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:26,490
some dude at the laugh factory the other
day I had a fucking ipad.

1443
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:28,020
The people behind you have to like,

1444
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:30,540
yeah,
you're holding up an IPAD.

1445
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:33,060
It's crazy to see everybody's got their 
phone out.

1446
01:08:33,061 --> 01:08:38,061
So the first,
that first barrier we talked about the 

1447
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:41,691
ignorance.
Just getting past understanding how to 

1448
01:08:41,691 --> 01:08:44,030
just get past not just what you think 
you know,

1449
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,240
you know,
all those things,

1450
01:08:45,241 --> 01:08:46,530
erasing,
erasing everything.

1451
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,900
Think you now get past the ignorant,
your own ignorance.

1452
01:08:48,901 --> 01:08:49,710
First of all,
right?

1453
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:53,400
Uh,
but just then that situational awareness

1454
01:08:53,401 --> 01:08:55,230
is kind of goes in hand in hand with 
that.

1455
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:58,260
Who are you?
Not only in your world,

1456
01:08:58,261 --> 01:09:01,920
but who are you in other people's world?
When I'm driving my,

1457
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:05,370
my primary mission is to get out of your
way.

1458
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:08,280
I want to get out of the way.
I want to get where I'm going.

1459
01:09:08,281 --> 01:09:13,281
I'm going to get out of the way.
I don't want to have you get out of my 

1460
01:09:13,281 --> 01:09:14,940
way because I'm going to a place.
I'm paying attention to where you are as

1461
01:09:14,941 --> 01:09:15,600
I'm driving.

1462
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:19,470
Because if I think like that,
if I think I'm in your way,

1463
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:22,410
this is all gonna work out better.
We're all gonna.

1464
01:09:22,411 --> 01:09:23,280
We're all gonna.
Get along.

1465
01:09:23,281 --> 01:09:25,710
If you think like that on the road,
like I am in your way,

1466
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,940
let me figure out how I can make sure 
that I'm,

1467
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,580
I'm getting where I'm going.
I'm not gonna put myself out.

1468
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:33,120
I'm not sure it's going to pull over the
side of the road while you all drive by.

1469
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:38,850
Um,
I'm going to get out of the way so that 

1470
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:39,240
I make it convenient for you to get 
where you're going as well.

1471
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,220
We're all going someplace,
right?

1472
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,560
We're in a car right away.
Let's not.

1473
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,030
Let's not fight here.

1474
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,110
Yeah,
let's not film ourselves driving either.

1475
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:52,140
Right?
I saw someone facetiming while they're 

1476
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:52,660
driving and holding up the phone,
talking to someone I'm passing by.

1477
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:56,350
I saw a dude doing candy crush awhile 
back playing candy crush on his phone.

1478
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:58,970
It's like,
whoa.

1479
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:01,780
People film,
fireworks.

1480
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:06,750
Does anybody ever watch it?
That makes no sense to me.

1481
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:08,200
Yeah.
You send it,

1482
01:10:08,201 --> 01:10:09,460
dude.
You wouldn't believe the fireworks.

1483
01:10:09,461 --> 01:10:11,320
I'm going to send it to you to please 
send it.

1484
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:15,340
I can't wait to see it.
Wait to see the video of fireworks.

1485
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:20,670
Can I put it on instagram?
Do you mind if I read Graham your 

1486
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:21,850
fireworks and brought it up?
I'd rather not.

1487
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:24,040
I'd really like all the hits.
This is a big,

1488
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:26,800
big,
awful video.

1489
01:10:26,801 --> 01:10:30,040
The thought of Focus.
You can't even tell what the fuck it is.

1490
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:33,430
You see some lights flashing off,
but when you go to a fireworks display,

1491
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:36,730
you see 50 fucking people holding up 
their God damn phones.

1492
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:37,990
Yeah.
What are you doing?

1493
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,340
What have you got?
Damn life.

1494
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:42,220
Live your fucking life,
right?

1495
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,420
Speaking to live your life.
When you.

1496
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,420
Since you signed up,
man,

1497
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,940
I'm always round up.
I got a problem

1498
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,390
down randomly.
Connor

1499
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:53,210
fucking settle down.
Settle down on a.

1500
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:57,350
put you down when you have so many 
different projects.

1501
01:10:57,351 --> 01:11:02,351
How do you choose like what to it?
Like when you take on something like a 

1502
01:11:02,351 --> 01:11:05,381
restaurant or you know,
opening this Jujitsu school or any of 

1503
01:11:05,381 --> 01:11:05,870
the number of numerous projects that you
do.

1504
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:08,910
You already are so fucking busy.
You have a family.

1505
01:11:08,911 --> 01:11:11,600
You already have these businesses and 
bands.

1506
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:13,200
How do you decide like what

1507
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:18,830
to do?
You just go on your instinct like what 

1508
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:18,830
to do?
Uh,

1509
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:18,830
well,
you know,

1510
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:22,520
everything has its own individual needs.
So and the,

1511
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,810
and what kinds of bands are touring or 
writing?

1512
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:30,200
There are absolute needs and processes.
A lead times,

1513
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:32,640
right?
If you're going to put out a book,

1514
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:38,330
you have to,
you have to understand that there's a 

1515
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:38,330
head low.
He said,

1516
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:40,650
as he wrote a book to fuck,
he plugged the device.

1517
01:11:40,651 --> 01:11:45,651
We feel lazy.
He's one of the few people I know that 

1518
01:11:45,651 --> 01:11:45,651
makes me.
I've wrote,

1519
01:11:45,651 --> 01:11:45,651
I read it to Sarah.
I,

1520
01:11:45,651 --> 01:11:46,480
you know,
I was,

1521
01:11:46,481 --> 01:11:47,490
I was involved,
uh,

1522
01:11:47,491 --> 01:11:50,340
you can credit,
goes to our attention with maynard James

1523
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:55,340
Keenan.
Guess a perfect union of contrary 

1524
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:56,160
things,
bone with my American.

1525
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:58,150
Um,
yeah.

1526
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:59,550
So it's,
it's a,

1527
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:02,310
it's understanding,
organizing your time.

1528
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,310
Delegating is huge.
Delegating is huge.

1529
01:12:05,311 --> 01:12:06,780
Understanding of what it's going to 
take,

1530
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:11,781
what kind of effort it's going to take 
for those things when it comes to 

1531
01:12:11,781 --> 01:12:14,811
winemaking,
unblocked down for that period of time 

1532
01:12:14,811 --> 01:12:14,811
when it comes to writing,
for example,

1533
01:12:14,811 --> 01:12:15,970
with a tool or with perfect circle 
there,

1534
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,980
Christopher understanding,
uh,

1535
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:21,750
you know,
timing.

1536
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,510
And we can get into that in a minute.
Wait,

1537
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:26,040
wait,
no.

1538
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:27,930
Okay.
Um,

1539
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:30,320
uh,
yeah,

1540
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:35,330
so it's,
it really does come down to 

1541
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:35,330
understanding.
I'm really good at planning,

1542
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:36,660
uh,
planning ahead and looking at things.

1543
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:38,710
So if I think,
uh,

1544
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,190
if,
if somebody comes along and says,

1545
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:42,870
hey,
we're going to do a thinking about doing

1546
01:12:42,871 --> 01:12:44,240
a film,
you want to be in the film,

1547
01:12:44,241 --> 01:12:49,241
I go,
when is it because I already have my 

1548
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:49,241
year.
You should see my schedule.

1549
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:50,190
It's,
it's a year and a half out.

1550
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:51,900
I'm brilliant.
Just locked in.

1551
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,280
Yeah,
because there's,

1552
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:54,970
you know,
there's things that I know that if a,

1553
01:12:55,020 --> 01:13:00,020
for example,
if you're going to put out a vinyl as a 

1554
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:00,020
band,
generally speaking,

1555
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:02,850
unless you're somebody who can make some
calls and cut some corners,

1556
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:08,540
if you're going to deliver a master to 
actually cut vinyl and now as you want 

1557
01:13:08,911 --> 01:13:11,340
your vulnerable to come out Monday that 
you record comes out.

1558
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,950
You don't want it to be a delayed thing 
and have it all be scattered.

1559
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:19,580
Um,
it takes three months that,

1560
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,960
that's your,
that's your lead time for production.

1561
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,140
No less than no less than three months 
is what you have.

1562
01:13:25,141 --> 01:13:27,030
Like an,
you have to make an order,

1563
01:13:27,031 --> 01:13:32,031
like,
say like x amount of thousands that you 

1564
01:13:32,031 --> 01:13:32,031
have.
So you have to plan ahead.

1565
01:13:32,031 --> 01:13:32,031
So if you,
if the,

1566
01:13:32,031 --> 01:13:34,020
if you finally get all your shit 
together and you've got your,

1567
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:36,030
you got your masters,
you're going to do a thing.

1568
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:39,090
I'm a,
then you have to go,

1569
01:13:39,091 --> 01:13:40,920
okay,
well then wants,

1570
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:42,250
that's wants,
that's their,

1571
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:47,940
uh,
the release date can't be any sooner 

1572
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:48,510
than this date.
What that date is,

1573
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,730
January first.
That's not good.

1574
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,760
Nobody really uses a record on January 
first just because it's a bad time to 

1575
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:56,340
release a record.
Just came out of Christmas.

1576
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:58,770
It's like,
it's like business wise,

1577
01:13:58,771 --> 01:14:00,390
they just don't,
you just don't do that.

1578
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,590
I'm having a rock concert on a New 
Year's Eve.

1579
01:14:04,591 --> 01:14:06,900
That's a different thing.
People that are out partying,

1580
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,960
they're going to do their thing.
So you're going to release a record in 

1581
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,081
the spring,
you're going to release record in the 

1582
01:14:15,081 --> 01:14:15,081
fall.

1583
01:14:15,081 --> 01:14:15,081
That's when you release it.
Generally speaking,

1584
01:14:15,081 --> 01:14:17,490
people will release all summer as well,
but the optimum times,

1585
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,350
our optimum times.
So just knowing that,

1586
01:14:20,351 --> 01:14:25,351
okay,
well if it takes that long to produce 

1587
01:14:25,351 --> 01:14:25,351
the record and get set up,
press and do interviews,

1588
01:14:25,351 --> 01:14:30,001
you know,
as for lead times in a magazine or 

1589
01:14:30,001 --> 01:14:30,001
online where they've,
you know,

1590
01:14:30,001 --> 01:14:34,620
interviews are schedule that we had this
planned amongst go a couple of months 

1591
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:35,410
ago because I couldn't just,
you couldn't,

1592
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:37,300
you would just call me last week and go,
hey,

1593
01:14:37,301 --> 01:14:40,810
you're gonna come in now.
We don't know what our schedules are.

1594
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:43,360
So you're thinking ahead.
Right?

1595
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:45,820
So same thing with the music,
you're always,

1596
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:47,470
you're always kind of looking ahead to 
go,

1597
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:49,660
well,
in order to deliver that master,

1598
01:14:49,661 --> 01:14:54,661
that means we had to be mastering that 
piece by here and we had to be mixing 

1599
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,360
and mixing and then looking at the mixes
again and fixing anything.

1600
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:03,360
It's meant to retract something and it 
kind of scrambling last minute before 

1601
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:07,321
mixing.
That's going to take this amount of 

1602
01:15:07,321 --> 01:15:07,321
time.
Well,

1603
01:15:07,321 --> 01:15:07,321
in order to mix,
we have to track,

1604
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:12,330
right?
So you have to have everything written 

1605
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:13,090
before you can actually track it to mix 
it,

1606
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:18,300
generally speaking.
So that means all the songs have to be 

1607
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,220
written by this day,
if we're going to record all of them and

1608
01:15:21,221 --> 01:15:25,030
mix all of them and master all of them 
and release them all on the same day.

1609
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:26,620
Right.
Well,

1610
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:30,940
so you have to think all the way back to
that day.

1611
01:15:30,941 --> 01:15:32,020
Like,
where are we today?

1612
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:35,440
Are Those songs finished today?
Cool.

1613
01:15:35,441 --> 01:15:36,520
Then we can start recording,
um,

1614
01:15:36,521 --> 01:15:38,350
tomorrow or next week?

1615
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,400
No.
How do you know when a song is finished?

1616
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,170
Like do you,
if you give yourself a deadline,

1617
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:43,390
let's say if you say,
um,

1618
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:48,460
you know,
we have six months to complete this 

1619
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:48,460
album or whatever it would be.
And you have a song that like,

1620
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,610
man,
it's just something about the songs.

1621
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:51,230
This doesn't feel right.
It's not done.

1622
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:53,450
Just something feels off like how do 
you,

1623
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:56,120
how do you finish something by a 
deadline?

1624
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,580
Um,
sometimes you don't,

1625
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:04,070
so you just take it out of the album and
put it aside for later or how do you,

1626
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:04,820
how do you do that?

1627
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:07,920
Yeah,
of course.

1628
01:16:07,921 --> 01:16:10,080
That varies with everybody.
Um,

1629
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,550
if it's not ready,
it's not ready.

1630
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:13,800
So you keep delaying and try to get it 
right,

1631
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,920
I guess.
Are you second guessing or you start 

1632
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:18,920
realizing,
uh,

1633
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,190
these are just some things we should 
just finish them.

1634
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:21,160
Hm.

1635
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:22,040
Well,
you know,

1636
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:27,100
remember that feeling when you were a 
kid when you get an album and some of 

1637
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:29,861
the songs were just fucking amazing and 
then you would hear like one or two or 

1638
01:16:29,861 --> 01:16:34,210
what the fuck is this piece of shit?
How did this get on a rolling stones 

1639
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:38,021
album?
And that was likely because they had a 

1640
01:16:38,021 --> 01:16:38,021
deadline and their record company made 
them,

1641
01:16:38,021 --> 01:16:38,610
they don't,
you know,

1642
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:43,620
they were locked into a contract that 
said that they had to deliver by a 

1643
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:43,620
certain time.
Right.

1644
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,920
But if you're not locked into that kind 
of a contract,

1645
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:48,640
then you can kind of take forever,
which is an equally awful thing

1646
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,250
to you.
Free of contracts.

1647
01:16:50,251 --> 01:16:51,600
Now,
are you your own man?

1648
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,760
It comes to mutual.
Has One more time record

1649
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,740
under a contract.
I'm perfect.

1650
01:16:55,741 --> 01:16:57,810
Circle.
Just signed up for a,

1651
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:01,080
a one,
a one album deal through a,

1652
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,370
through a company.
Um,

1653
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:08,810
to do you know,
it's one off album by post suffers an 

1654
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:12,591
independent project.
We've been independent from the 

1655
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:14,441
beginning.
So do you prefer that or is there 

1656
01:17:14,441 --> 01:17:17,561
benefits to both?
I think there's benefits to all those 

1657
01:17:17,561 --> 01:17:17,561
things.
Depends on,

1658
01:17:17,561 --> 01:17:17,990
it depends on how many,
how much,

1659
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:23,020
how many trust issues you have.
I guess like if you're going to work 

1660
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:25,421
with a large company,
if you can trust them to handle and 

1661
01:17:25,421 --> 01:17:28,871
carry some of the water on some of these
things without getting lost or spilled 

1662
01:17:28,871 --> 01:17:29,540
or you know,
dumped.

1663
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:30,950
Um,
yeah.

1664
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:34,760
You can work with a company like that.
It depends on your goals I suppose.

1665
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:37,800
Is it like more of a benefit now that 
you are.

1666
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:39,150
I mean especially,
I don't know.

1667
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,930
I don't know if now you're dealing with 
the resurgence of vinyl.

1668
01:17:41,931 --> 01:17:44,300
It's been pretty steady over the last 
few years,

1669
01:17:44,301 --> 01:17:45,260
right?
It's kind of like a,

1670
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:50,030
like a mason jar type thing.
People in the old funky stuff,

1671
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:50,910
you know?
Yeah.

1672
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:55,980
Well I think there's still that 
nostalgic feel of touching the vinyl and

1673
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:59,060
then being able to have,
have that thing and listened to it.

1674
01:17:59,061 --> 01:18:04,061
Then there is a difference,
but I feel like going back to what you 

1675
01:18:04,061 --> 01:18:05,300
had mentioned earlier about people 
realizing,

1676
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:10,360
oh wait,
I think we need to start looking and 

1677
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,091
talking to each other again and 
reconnecting and I feel like vinyl is 

1678
01:18:13,091 --> 01:18:16,610
another tip of that iceberg of that 
connection of like,

1679
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:21,850
it's not long,
it's that this is so temporary and so 

1680
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:22,220
yeah,
a one digital.

1681
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:23,000
Yeah.
So ditch,

1682
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:25,910
so one emp away from all that stuff 
being gone.

1683
01:18:25,911 --> 01:18:27,920
Your entire,
all those experiences you wasted.

1684
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,920
He were,
you were recording the fireworks rather 

1685
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,880
than actually looking at the fireworks 
and then you lost your job or your phone

1686
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:37,040
in the toilet.
It's gone.

1687
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:42,470
Or an emp wipes out all of the servers 
that are on your cloud.

1688
01:18:42,471 --> 01:18:47,471
And so all of those photos that you 
thought were safe somewhere and no 

1689
01:18:47,471 --> 01:18:48,260
longer.
So you freaked me out here.

1690
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,880
Right?
But yeah.

1691
01:18:49,881 --> 01:18:50,650
So,
um,

1692
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:51,830
I think vinyl,
there's,

1693
01:18:51,831 --> 01:18:52,820
that.
There's a connection,

1694
01:18:52,821 --> 01:18:55,250
there's a tactal.
Does it sound better?

1695
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,960
I think it does.
Yeah.

1696
01:18:56,990 --> 01:19:00,140
I think it does because it depends on,
um,

1697
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:01,460
uh,
are you,

1698
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,530
are you creed?
It's never going to sound better.

1699
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:05,270
Dare you.
What about nickelback

1700
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:08,140
shit on all the shit on him with a free 
punch.

1701
01:19:08,141 --> 01:19:11,730
Hurry up.
Get your shots in.

1702
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:14,680
Judo is a good one.
In sync was always a good one.

1703
01:19:14,681 --> 01:19:15,700
Udo.
Wow.

1704
01:19:15,701 --> 01:19:17,590
He went deep,
deep backstreet boys.

1705
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:19,630
Remember you.
You should be able to punch,

1706
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:22,420
punch down on them.
It was an easy shot.

1707
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:25,870
I had them in judo album.

1708
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:28,330
Did you know?

1709
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:33,780
Um,
but he takes more punches than 

1710
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:33,780
nickelback yeah,
they took a lot of shots.

1711
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:33,950
Yeah.
People just go after them.

1712
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:36,260
Yeah.
And now like they never fight back.

1713
01:19:36,261 --> 01:19:37,580
They're like,
what the fuck man?

1714
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,550
Because they,
I know on some level they asked for it.

1715
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:42,680
Sorry.
Have they asked for it?

1716
01:19:42,681 --> 01:19:43,700
I don't know.
I'm just,

1717
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,710
I'm just jumping in on the,
on this rat pack.

1718
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,040
They make good stripper music.
Yes,

1719
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:50,240
they do.
You know they make good poll music.

1720
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:51,130
Yeah.
Right.

1721
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:52,470
Girls Spin around.
Pull

1722
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:54,120
your right.
It's nickelback.

1723
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,280
Yes.
I think.

1724
01:19:56,281 --> 01:19:57,330
Yeah,
I think that is the.

1725
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:02,810
That's the vinyl connection I think is 
there's a lot of guys nowadays like tool

1726
01:20:04,081 --> 01:20:05,070
for example,
would just.

1727
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,520
They'd like analog,
like tracking to tape and to really 

1728
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:14,691
translate those things of vinyl is your 
perfect medium for that thing.

1729
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:18,540
It's just not very convenient.
There is no record stores.

1730
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:24,720
When I released the first poster for 
record in 2007 from the time we started 

1731
01:20:25,891 --> 01:20:28,350
recording that record until the time we 
released it,

1732
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:33,830
there was one number of stores when we 
started the recording and there was one 

1733
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:37,461
fifth,
the number of stores actually in 

1734
01:20:37,461 --> 01:20:37,461
existence by the time we actually 
released it,

1735
01:20:37,461 --> 01:20:42,430
record industry stopped and went away 
during that period of time,

1736
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:45,850
so 2007 was when the wave rolled back 
like you could see it happen.

1737
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:50,870
It was gone and it was gone and that was
still with best buy's that we're still 

1738
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:50,870
selling.

1739
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:51,720
Cds was still part of that one.
Twentieth.

1740
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:53,640
Wow.
Now this is all.

1741
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:57,900
It's all rolled back to where the small 
independent stores that weren't greedy,

1742
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:01,320
that really had a relationship with 
their customers that enjoyed vinyl,

1743
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:06,350
that had all those things.
Those are the ones that have survived 

1744
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:06,360
and thrived.
Like Amoeba.

1745
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:07,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

1746
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:12,680
Those kind of much smaller versions of 
those things like Zia records and the 

1747
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,120
Arizona.
Yeah.

1748
01:21:14,121 --> 01:21:19,121
I've seen a few of those on the road and
have gotten into a bunch of them and 

1749
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:19,560
they're kind of cool.
It's a totally different thing.

1750
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:21,200
It's almost like you're going to an 
antique store,

1751
01:21:21,201 --> 01:21:23,700
so I think we is great if you ever go 
through stink weeds.

1752
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,190
Oh yeah.
There's that in,

1753
01:21:25,191 --> 01:21:25,950
uh,
in Arizona.

1754
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:26,520
Oh,
well,

1755
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:31,550
what?
I think tempy Kimberly's going to kill 

1756
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:31,550
me.
Tempe.

1757
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:33,030
Um,
because I couldn't remember what it was.

1758
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:35,010
I just do the Tempe Improv all the time.

1759
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:36,420
That's a cool little spot.
Yeah.

1760
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:39,240
Tempe is interesting little town.
Yeah.

1761
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,370
Yeah.
That whole area is really awesome.

1762
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:42,670
So,
um,

1763
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:45,090
when you,
when you make a run of those things,

1764
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:47,070
you kind of have to decide like as 
they're selling,

1765
01:21:47,071 --> 01:21:48,900
when to to make more of them too,
right?

1766
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:49,410
Yeah.
Well,

1767
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:52,320
as a small project like pushed for your,
you know,

1768
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:54,660
we're writing the checks so you don't 
want to over,

1769
01:21:55,020 --> 01:22:00,020
you don't want to overproduce these 
things because then you're kind of 

1770
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:00,150
sitting on them and for us at the level 
that we're operating,

1771
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:04,080
he always wanted to operate in that 
level where it's sustainable.

1772
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:06,480
Right.
That's kind of a beat word.

1773
01:22:06,481 --> 01:22:07,100
But yeah,
I,

1774
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,860
you know,
I use it all the time because this,

1775
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,540
it's the most accurate word to really 
look.

1776
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:11,130
Yes.
Sustainable.

1777
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:13,200
If I can keep this thing to keep this 
thing alive,

1778
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:18,530
I don't want to keep going back to other
pockets of money to make this thing led 

1779
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:21,860
to think should stand on its own.
So you have to be making all these 

1780
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,700
decisions as if this is an independent 
business on its own.

1781
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,270
Just ready to survive.
And so yeah,

1782
01:22:26,271 --> 01:22:28,710
you have to pay attention to if they 
want.

1783
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,980
If they want 10,
maybe nine.

1784
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:35,370
Interesting.
Yeah.

1785
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:37,950
They 1:10
make night and keep people wanting more.

1786
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,910
Always.
Always told.

1787
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:46,600
Don't live past means right.
Step there in the goldilocks zone.

1788
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:53,390
Yes.
Do you anticipate ever trimming it down 

1789
01:22:53,431 --> 01:22:56,310
to one band or do you like working with 
three different projects?

1790
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:57,930
Well,
I think just the nature of,

1791
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:00,660
of,
of tool in general,

1792
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,190
uh,
jump into them,

1793
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:07,660
uh,
August one to use just their process in 

1794
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:11,230
their writing process is,
is so drawn out.

1795
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:16,320
And I mean,
I'm sure there's a lot of reasons that 

1796
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,730
go into why the delay has been so long.
Um,

1797
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:23,280
but when you have a project like that,
there's always going to be time for me 

1798
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,420
to do other things and I will,
I will definitely.

1799
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:28,540
I just liked doing it.
I like doing it more.

1800
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:33,541
I like to release records and write 
things a little more quickly than those 

1801
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:33,541
guys like to write.

1802
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:37,710
So their process is a very analytical 
and I think,

1803
01:23:39,371 --> 01:23:41,890
you know,
at some point maybe because so much time

1804
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:46,030
has gone by with a,
from the last album,

1805
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,630
there has to be some,
a little bit of fear in there,

1806
01:23:49,631 --> 01:23:50,350
you know,
in your gut,

1807
01:23:50,351 --> 01:23:53,980
like has or is this record going to be 
as good as the last one?

1808
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:54,790
Uh,
you know,

1809
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:57,880
the anticipation now is now the pressure
is huge,

1810
01:23:57,881 --> 01:24:00,520
so I'm sure there's some of that goes 
into play,

1811
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:03,670
but as far as the way that,
uh,

1812
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:05,350
Danny and Adam and Justin,
right,

1813
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:08,290
it's a very,
very tedious,

1814
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:13,350
a long process and they're always going 
back over things and questioning what 

1815
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:16,090
they did and stepping back and going 
back farther and going forward.

1816
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:20,080
And in a way it's like they're,
they're laying a foundation,

1817
01:24:20,081 --> 01:24:21,730
they're putting in the footings for a 
house.

1818
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:26,760
So I can't write,
I can't write melodies until the 

1819
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:26,760
footings are in place.

1820
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:29,770
I can't write words until the melodies 
are in place.

1821
01:24:29,771 --> 01:24:34,771
So I can't,
like I can't build walls and then start 

1822
01:24:34,771 --> 01:24:36,840
decorating this place until the 
foundation is in place because if they 

1823
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,260
keep changing the foundation,
changing the footings,

1824
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,920
the melodies change.
And then the story of course isn't 

1825
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:44,800
getting written.
So that's where we are.

1826
01:24:44,801 --> 01:24:49,801
I mean there's a lot of,
there's a lot of footings that keep 

1827
01:24:49,801 --> 01:24:49,801
shifting,
lots of awesome footings,

1828
01:24:49,801 --> 01:24:52,180
but they keep changing so.
And they keep changing their minds.

1829
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:54,310
So I don't know if it's a good thing or 
a bad thing,

1830
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:55,930
it's just their process.

1831
01:24:56,210 --> 01:25:01,210
Is this a challenge for you to kind of 
manage your own personal expectations 

1832
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:05,831
with the work of others and like,
because I know you're so you're very 

1833
01:25:05,831 --> 01:25:08,771
prolific and you're a guy that just like
you're very disciplined so you always 

1834
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:11,921
grinding and then when you manage those 
expectations and you're dealing with a 

1835
01:25:11,921 --> 01:25:14,660
bunch of other artists and you're all 
converging together,

1836
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,900
converging together on this project 
combined cannot make a word up.

1837
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:20,060
I think it just made it up.
Yeah.

1838
01:25:20,061 --> 01:25:20,570
So like,
you know,

1839
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:22,430
when you have a lot of very strong 
willed,

1840
01:25:22,431 --> 01:25:27,431
stubborn,
opinionated people that have had 

1841
01:25:27,431 --> 01:25:27,431
success,
myself included,

1842
01:25:27,431 --> 01:25:29,510
like when you give somebody some 
success,

1843
01:25:29,511 --> 01:25:31,220
they're pretty,
they're pretty convinced they're right,

1844
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:32,690
you know,
so,

1845
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:38,200
so it's hard to,
it's hard to talk to me or it's hard to 

1846
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,481
talk to them.
It's hard to talk to people that are in 

1847
01:25:40,481 --> 01:25:40,481
that position because they've been 
successful.

1848
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:42,590
Um,
and so you're,

1849
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:47,650
you think that the reason you got there 
is because of whatever position it is 

1850
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,850
you're taking today,
which is fine.

1851
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:51,040
But our,
you know,

1852
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:54,980
our process has,
has evolved over the years,

1853
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:58,820
uh,
and that,

1854
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:00,230
you know,
that stubborn nature,

1855
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:05,740
he try yet again,
take step back and not take any,

1856
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,790
any of these things personally,
you know,

1857
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,550
that's our tendency is to like what is 
you,

1858
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,910
you,
you,

1859
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:13,040
you,
you get that way.

1860
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,560
Familiarity breeds contempt kind of 
thing.

1861
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:20,650
How much of a problem is expectations of
the fans because the fans like want new 

1862
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:21,590
shit,
come on,

1863
01:26:21,591 --> 01:26:22,580
where's the fucking new shit?

1864
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:23,560
And that's.
And that's,

1865
01:26:23,561 --> 01:26:26,710
you know,
that I'm sure that that was around 15,

1866
01:26:26,711 --> 01:26:31,711
20 years ago.
But without social media and without 

1867
01:26:31,711 --> 01:26:32,700
that direct access of bitching,
you know,

1868
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:38,070
like the star reviews on like the,
on itunes when people are like writing 

1869
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:40,720
reviews of shows or music or movies or 
whatever.

1870
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:44,380
It's like again,
go to a master,

1871
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:48,370
learned from the master to the point 
where you are now,

1872
01:26:48,371 --> 01:26:51,640
you have mastership all of that's gone.
It's just like,

1873
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:57,090
it stook it took forever to load.
I don't like the guy with the hair 

1874
01:26:57,090 --> 01:26:58,680
fucked this one,
one star like

1875
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:01,950
okay,
but like being able to do that.

1876
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:02,820
Yeah,
they love it.

1877
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:07,850
Especially if you work at like Jiffy 
Lube when you're sitting there and 

1878
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:12,230
you're on your fucking break and you're 
smoking a cigarette and you're farting 

1879
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:12,630
and you're sitting there like,
fuck the song,

1880
01:27:12,631 --> 01:27:15,360
fuck this outfit.
Focus head,

1881
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:16,930
right?
Yeah.

1882
01:27:17,370 --> 01:27:17,620
Yeah.

1883
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:19,900
It doesn't really make sense.
So,

1884
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:23,740
and also in my brother's defense,
even billy from perfect circle,

1885
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,120
uh,
he's,

1886
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,880
he's slow moving as well.
Um,

1887
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:29,550
but he has a lot of,
you know,

1888
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:32,560
now we're starting to work on stuff that
it's taken many years for him to kind of

1889
01:27:32,561 --> 01:27:34,490
build up the cash of things that we're,
you know,

1890
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:39,540
we're digging into,
to look at things that have been in 

1891
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:40,000
development for the last six,
eight,

1892
01:27:40,001 --> 01:27:40,600
10 years.

1893
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:45,890
Well,
you seem to have found this interesting 

1894
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:45,890
balance because you're such a,
you,

1895
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:48,100
you have so many different things that 
require your focus,

1896
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,700
but you're also so,
you,

1897
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:54,710
you're,
you're one of those dudes that has to 

1898
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:56,041
get shit done.
I've met a lot of guys like you that 

1899
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:56,041
just like,
I'm getting shit done.

1900
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:57,580
You're either my way or you're going to 
help me.

1901
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,930
Are you gonna?
Get the fuck out of my way.

1902
01:27:58,931 --> 01:28:00,850
But I'm getting shit done and so you're 
like,

1903
01:28:00,851 --> 01:28:02,560
okay,
I can't get shit done over here.

1904
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:04,780
I'm going to get shit done over here.
I'm going to go do this,

1905
01:28:04,810 --> 01:28:07,000
I'm going to start a wine company now 
making a restaurant.

1906
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:08,320
Oh look,
I have a Jujitsu school.

1907
01:28:08,321 --> 01:28:13,321
Look,
I wrote a book and you're just 

1908
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:16,411
constantly.
It's fascinating because you're also 

1909
01:28:16,411 --> 01:28:19,950
pretty at peace,
like you've found like this strange 

1910
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:22,680
balance of activity and then also 
relative isolation and your small area 

1911
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:24,100
took

1912
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,610
me awhile to like,
you know,

1913
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:27,750
my,
my desire to move forward with go,

1914
01:28:27,751 --> 01:28:29,860
go,
go and get things done.

1915
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:34,880
You know,
I'm always butting heads heads with and 

1916
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,060
the guys in the band and tool to get 
those things done and just,

1917
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:40,450
it's just not their process.
So it took me a while for me to go,

1918
01:28:40,451 --> 01:28:41,960
this is not personal,
this is just them.

1919
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:45,550
This is just the way that they have to 
do it and I have to respect it.

1920
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:50,470
And I had to take my time and let them 
take their time and I just check in.

1921
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:52,720
I just go,
I come and I see what's going on.

1922
01:28:52,721 --> 01:28:54,400
Hey Justin,
uh,

1923
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:57,640
some may send me the track,
see where we're at,

1924
01:28:57,970 --> 01:29:02,970
is this thing done?
If this thing is done done and I can 

1925
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,830
start writing words and music on it.
Great.

1926
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:08,670
But I've had instances where I've 
started to write stuff and by the time I

1927
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:11,160
actually got it around and back and 
we're at last,

1928
01:29:11,161 --> 01:29:16,161
she listening and whatever the Ta had 
gone in a completely different 

1929
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:16,830
direction.

1930
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:22,190
So everything that was written melody 
wise or lyric wise was completely 

1931
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:22,230
irrelevant.
Now I have to start over.

1932
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:24,570
Is that weird because you guys aren't in
the same location.

1933
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:29,580
Physically I can sit there in that room 
a and be with them in that room,

1934
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:35,140
but their process is so tedious and so 
like rain man.

1935
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:40,650
Then I just can't.
I just started fucking folding in on 

1936
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:40,650
myself like,
you know,

1937
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:41,550
right back.
I gotta go make Pasta.

1938
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:47,460
I got to be right back.
I gotta go take five years to plant a 

1939
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:49,290
vineyard because the old still be right 
where you were when I left.

1940
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:51,000
Um,
but it's,

1941
01:29:51,090 --> 01:29:53,580
it's a great thing.
What they're doing is a wonderful.

1942
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:57,660
I completely back what you're doing.
Uh,

1943
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:03,100
no another way to do it.
There's no other way for them to do it 

1944
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:03,100
for me.
I can,

1945
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:04,380
I can move much more quickly if you'll,
if you'll let me help you.

1946
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,190
I've done,
you know,

1947
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:07,020
I've written a few songs.
In fact,

1948
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:09,370
I was involved in many of them,
um,

1949
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:12,000
the ones that we've done so we could do 
that,

1950
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:16,110
but I think this is what the,
this is what they need to do.

1951
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,280
Uh,
and I'm,

1952
01:30:18,281 --> 01:30:19,090
I'm okay with it.
I,

1953
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:24,200
you know,
you got to get a little friction and 

1954
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:24,200
they're set to come in and,
you know,

1955
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,030
and puff my chest out a little bit and 
be aggressive and let's,

1956
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:26,600
you know,
let's,

1957
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:28,200
let's move guys,
let's move it.

1958
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:30,660
Um,
and that worked for a minute,

1959
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:31,740
uh,
and we,

1960
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:34,650
we definitely make traction,
but if I were to do that every day,

1961
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,350
it would just become a part of the 
friction,

1962
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:40,820
more friction rather than actually 
getting anything done.

1963
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,540
Seems like one of the biggest problems 
with bands,

1964
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:47,541
right?
It's just getting into personalities 

1965
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:47,541
together.
Yeah,

1966
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:47,541
yeah,
yeah,

1967
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:47,541
yeah,
yeah.

1968
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:49,080
We're definitely very strong for very 
strong personalities.

1969
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:51,150
Um,
you know,

1970
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,600
same with billy,
working with billy with perfect circle,

1971
01:30:55,380 --> 01:31:00,380
he gets a little forest for trees 
sometimes and I'm like the guy gone 

1972
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:02,370
what,
step back,

1973
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:04,350
look at it.
Um,

1974
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:07,060
and then I'm out the door for poor guys.
Go home.

1975
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:07,650
Where'd you go?

1976
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,060
Uh,
and then,

1977
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:16,070
you know,
working with Matt Mitchell and Corina 

1978
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:16,070
and,
and put suffer.

1979
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:21,020
We all generally work with or for other 
projects and other people.

1980
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:26,250
So when we get together we are fucking 
streamline organized.

1981
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,020
We go,
okay,

1982
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:30,690
I'll check in with the guys and tool and
go,

1983
01:31:30,691 --> 01:31:31,530
okay,
where are we at?

1984
01:31:31,531 --> 01:31:33,360
What do we got?
Are we there?

1985
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:34,980
Is it like,
are we going to track tomorrow?

1986
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:37,680
Because we're going to track tomorrow.
I can tell you.

1987
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:39,600
Great.
Then this is,

1988
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:42,330
we're going to line this up,
but if we're not going to track tomorrow

1989
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:47,990
and it's going to take this much time,
well then I'm going to do this other 

1990
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:49,950
thing while we're telling me when that 
day is,

1991
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,500
when we're,
when we're ready to start,

1992
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:55,140
when these are done,
I can take my time to write.

1993
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:57,420
Um,
I mean,

1994
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:03,020
in fairness,
I should take my 10 years to write 

1995
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:03,020
lyrics now,
but I won't do that,

1996
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:06,160
but I'll hold,
I'll digest these things as quickly as I

1997
01:32:06,161 --> 01:32:08,410
can and,
and keep that moment,

1998
01:32:08,411 --> 01:32:13,411
that freshness of what my impressions 
are of the finished tracks and we'll 

1999
01:32:13,411 --> 01:32:13,411
start,
but nothing,

2000
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:15,340
you know,
nothing is tracked yet.

2001
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Nothing is completely finished as a 
couple of songs that I think are 

2002
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:21,000
finished now,
I can start working on those,

2003
01:32:21,650 --> 01:32:24,900
but nothing's actually recorded.
There's just all for.

2004
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:27,230
They're just written.
Um,

2005
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,250
so that leaves time so I can actually go
and work with,

2006
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:31,390
uh,
with billy.

2007
01:32:31,391 --> 01:32:32,680
I can work with Matt,
Corrina,

2008
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,470
um,
and,

2009
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,160
and get other things done in the 
interim.

2010
01:32:36,161 --> 01:32:38,020
So there's.
So there's more.

2011
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:39,970
Yeah.
When you write something like say if you

2012
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:41,470
have an idea,
if you're just sitting around you like,

2013
01:32:41,471 --> 01:32:44,620
I have a thought,
do you just sit down and you go,

2014
01:32:44,621 --> 01:32:45,850
okay,
this is a tool song.

2015
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:48,550
This is a perfect circle song.
This is a pushover song.

2016
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,240
Does it just like,

2017
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:50,720
no,
because what I'm,

2018
01:32:50,721 --> 01:32:54,950
what I'm writing to is,
is the music that I'm hearing from those

2019
01:32:54,951 --> 01:32:56,840
people.
So that's all you write too.

2020
01:32:56,841 --> 01:32:59,090
I write to the music because that way 
it's a unique,

2021
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,100
it's a unique island situation.
Those,

2022
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:03,140
those things are gonna.
Whenever I've tried to write,

2023
01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:08,170
I've had some poetry sitting over here 
that I want to write and I tried to 

2024
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:11,960
force it onto a song for any of those 
projects.

2025
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:13,790
It doesn't work.
It doesn't,

2026
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:15,230
it doesn't.
It doesn't seem to fit.

2027
01:33:16,010 --> 01:33:21,010
So you need to hear the song,
I need to hear the finished thing for 

2028
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:22,280
almost finished thing and then put 
lyrics to it.

2029
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:23,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

2030
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:25,340
Get them,
get the melodies in place,

2031
01:33:25,341 --> 01:33:26,990
get the rhythm is as if I'm an 
instrument.

2032
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:29,120
And that how you guys did that Fibonacci
Song?

2033
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:30,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

2034
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:31,730
Wow.
Yeah.

2035
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:34,730
That was a really unique undertaking.
How,

2036
01:33:34,731 --> 01:33:36,230
what,
what was the process behind that?

2037
01:33:36,230 --> 01:33:38,000
Like did you,
did you say hey,

2038
01:33:38,150 --> 01:33:41,870
it would be a nifty idea and do 
something to a mathematical sequence?

2039
01:33:41,871 --> 01:33:42,710
Nope.
No,

2040
01:33:43,010 --> 01:33:44,450
that was a complete accident.
Uh,

2041
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:49,580
I think it was,
I think it was Adam or justin who had 

2042
01:33:49,581 --> 01:33:52,250
the riff and at some point they were 
actually counting,

2043
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:56,090
counting the riff and it ended up being 
in a seven,

2044
01:33:56,091 --> 01:33:56,600
eight,
nine.

2045
01:33:56,601 --> 01:34:01,601
I think it was like a measure of seven,
a measure of a measure of nine and I'm 

2046
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:06,191
not sure how you would actually write 
that out as a and no notation,

2047
01:34:06,861 --> 01:34:07,730
but,
um,

2048
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:12,860
you know,
I think seven 89 is of FIBONACCI number.

2049
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,740
I'm just that,
you know,

2050
01:34:16,130 --> 01:34:18,800
the actual seminar and 89 I think.
I think,

2051
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:19,850
uh,
I have to look at again,

2052
01:34:19,851 --> 01:34:21,670
it might be nine 87.

2053
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:23,000
Well,
I don't know what the fuck we're talking

2054
01:34:23,001 --> 01:34:27,230
about FIBONACCI sequences,
a very unique mathematical sequence that

2055
01:34:27,231 --> 01:34:28,820
appears in nature.
It's a,

2056
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:32,060
it's in fractals,
it's in sunflowers.

2057
01:34:32,061 --> 01:34:34,220
If you look at the pattern of a 
sunflower seeds,

2058
01:34:34,221 --> 01:34:36,650
if you look at nautilus shells and what 
it is,

2059
01:34:36,651 --> 01:34:41,180
it's an expanding fractal,
sort of a mathematical equation.

2060
01:34:41,181 --> 01:34:44,530
I don't know if I'm saying it correctly,
but it's like the first step is zero and

2061
01:34:44,531 --> 01:34:48,950
then there's one and then there's one to
two posts.

2062
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,690
Yeah.
And it just keeps going on.

2063
01:34:50,691 --> 01:34:52,970
So that's the,
that's the FIBONACCI number,

2064
01:34:53,290 --> 01:34:54,260
a whole number,

2065
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:59,680
like actual number sequence.
There's the fire ratio.

2066
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:01,280
One point,
one point six,

2067
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:03,500
one eight,
anything multiplied by the one point six

2068
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:05,060
minute that,
that are not,

2069
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,460
not multiplied.
The relationship,

2070
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,380
uh,
the difference,

2071
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:13,580
the difference in the length from this 
finger,

2072
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:15,840
this finger as opposed to this finger,
that finger,

2073
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:16,090
that,
those,

2074
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:20,210
those knuckles and your digits,
those are all in that,

2075
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:22,670
in that relationship of one point six,
one eight.

2076
01:35:22,671 --> 01:35:26,480
The fire relationships so that the 
fractals as it's,

2077
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:29,480
as it's growing,
that progression is,

2078
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:30,740
uh,
is that,

2079
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,410
is that ratio.
And then the number breakdown is,

2080
01:35:33,411 --> 01:35:34,580
as you said,
it's one,

2081
01:35:34,581 --> 01:35:35,540
one,
two,

2082
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:36,440
three,
five,

2083
01:35:36,441 --> 01:35:37,250
eight,
13.

2084
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:37,820
Yeah,
it was.

2085
01:35:37,821 --> 01:35:41,400
So like one plus one is two,
two plus one is three,

2086
01:35:41,401 --> 01:35:43,590
three plus two is five,
five plus three is eight.

2087
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:46,050
And it's like everything you,
you count,

2088
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,770
you add what came before it ended a 
spiral,

2089
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,780
a picture of like of a Giza plateau 
showing you them.

2090
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:55,200
Well also facial structure,
which is really fascinating.

2091
01:35:55,560 --> 01:36:00,560
There's something about human facial 
structure that uses the FIBONACCI 

2092
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,791
sequence.
And I read somewhere about why people 

2093
01:36:04,791 --> 01:36:06,000
recognize plastic surgery while it 
disturbs them.

2094
01:36:06,150 --> 01:36:07,020
Boom.
Yeah.

2095
01:36:07,021 --> 01:36:08,960
It's like what's going on with the 
sequence?

2096
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:10,860
The sequence is off.
So my friend.

2097
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:11,670
Yeah.
Here it is,

2098
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,610
the FIBONACCI relationships of the human
head.

2099
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:16,950
And then all A.
I had a friend who said,

2100
01:36:16,951 --> 01:36:18,990
you know how when you know a,
you know,

2101
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,180
a family has had a child

2102
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:23,040
who has down's syndrome,
right?

2103
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:26,870
There's does,
it crosses racial divides.

2104
01:36:26,871 --> 01:36:28,300
It just,
you can tell this.

2105
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:31,590
This family has had that,
that child has down syndrome.

2106
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:33,360
There was a look that goes along with 
it.

2107
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:35,460
He said if the same look,
you know,

2108
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:36,670
not the same look,
but like,

2109
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:41,940
it's the same recognition of people who 
have had a facial plastic

2110
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:47,050
surgery.
You recognize you're not fooling 

2111
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:47,050
anybody.
You are,

2112
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:49,430
you've done a thing that's recognizable 
universally as wrong.

2113
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:52,040
Something's wrong with your son.
Doesn't off.

2114
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,030
Yeah,
it's off.

2115
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:54,290
Yeah.
But I thought he was

2116
01:36:54,490 --> 01:36:56,920
funny that he was actually connecting it
to doubt.

2117
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:58,870
No disrespect to people with down 
syndrome.

2118
01:36:58,871 --> 01:36:59,930
But um,

2119
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:01,220
yeah,
I know what you're saying.

2120
01:37:01,221 --> 01:37:01,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

2121
01:37:01,581 --> 01:37:06,581
But,
but it's like when you see someone with 

2122
01:37:06,581 --> 01:37:06,581
a disease,
like Oh,

2123
01:37:06,581 --> 01:37:06,980
there's clearly an error here in the 
code.

2124
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:08,700
Yes.
Yeah.

2125
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,630
And the,
and the facial reconstruction,

2126
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,950
like the plastic surgery because I'm 
just,

2127
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:13,780
Oh shit,
I,

2128
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:18,860
I'm getting older.
You just have them hold the nose thing 

2129
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:21,701
too is weird.
Like when someone has a uniquely small 

2130
01:37:21,701 --> 01:37:22,940
nose and their face,
they might have like a long,

2131
01:37:22,941 --> 01:37:27,941
like Ari Shaffir type face.
But then they have this like shrunken 

2132
01:37:27,941 --> 01:37:29,300
down knows you're like hey yeah,
this seems fucked.

2133
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:30,420
Right?
So it doesn't.

2134
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:33,650
There's a ratio that supposed to exist 
and it doesn't exist.

2135
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:35,980
But you know,
in a,

2136
01:37:35,981 --> 01:37:37,040
in a,
in a,

2137
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:41,040
in a way a song like a lottery with the 
FIBONACCI thing that's,

2138
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:46,180
that's I feel like I kind of pulled a 
very pedestrian sophomore move by 

2139
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:54,310
including those numbers in there because
in general music is the fire ratio.

2140
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:57,660
Everything,
everything that all nature,

2141
01:37:57,661 --> 01:37:58,980
all these things.
We're talking about it.

2142
01:37:58,981 --> 01:38:02,130
It's already here by,
by pointing it out,

2143
01:38:02,131 --> 01:38:06,610
like staring at it and pointing at it.
With those numbers are present and the,

2144
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:09,210
and the way that the numbers and the 
lyrics are,

2145
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:10,860
I feel like that,
you know,

2146
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:14,640
it's good to let people know about it,
but I almost feel like it was kind of a,

2147
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:17,700
it was kind of a Dick joke in a way.
It's,

2148
01:38:18,570 --> 01:38:19,260
it's,
um,

2149
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:22,110
I could do better.
That's interesting.

2150
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:24,900
Are you one of those ruthlessly 
introspective guys?

2151
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:25,980
Just choose.
Yeah.

2152
01:38:25,981 --> 01:38:28,780
Probably so obvious.
So anybody's name

2153
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:30,090
good at anything.
Does that.

2154
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,180
No other way around.
Good thing.

2155
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:34,620
Good thing.
I'm not good at anything.

2156
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:37,080
It's almost like you have a guard dog,
but you turn on yourself.

2157
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:40,160
Yeah.
Sit.

2158
01:38:40,410 --> 01:38:41,930
You know what I mean?
It's like,

2159
01:38:41,931 --> 01:38:43,380
you know,
like figuring out what's wrong with me.

2160
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:44,970
Get me,
get me.

2161
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:46,410
And then you,
uh,

2162
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,380
yeah.
Fly.

2163
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:50,580
You're fucked.
I'm my own guard dog.

2164
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:55,880
One shot to the dome.
I break the God I punched through the 

2165
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:57,840
guard.
My shots go through your God.

2166
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:00,960
Keep your hands up.
Okay.

2167
01:39:00,961 --> 01:39:04,440
That's enough.
You're fucked.

2168
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:08,530
Hey,
everyone's fucked yet.

2169
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:09,540
But that's,
um,

2170
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:15,090
that's a characteristic that I see in 
almost everybody that I respect.

2171
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:19,830
They all think that everything they do 
socks or at least they have very,

2172
01:39:19,831 --> 01:39:22,980
very high standards and are often 
disappointed by their own work.

2173
01:39:23,530 --> 01:39:24,190
Well,
you know,

2174
01:39:24,191 --> 01:39:27,850
I think I have some of that,
but I also have that idea of like,

2175
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:33,920
it's something that might.
I don't know if I talked about my dad 

2176
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:33,920
with you,
but um,

2177
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,590
he was my wrestling coach in high 
school.

2178
01:39:35,890 --> 01:39:37,090
Uh,
he was also my,

2179
01:39:37,390 --> 01:39:42,390
uh,
earth science biology and environmental 

2180
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:42,520
studies teacher.
He was my teacher.

2181
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:43,990
Well,
what a drag you went to school,

2182
01:39:44,290 --> 01:39:49,290
your dad being the tea does fucking.
And I learned a lot because he was no 

2183
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:50,170
joke.
He didn't pull any punches for me.

2184
01:39:50,171 --> 01:39:50,700
He,
you know,

2185
01:39:50,710 --> 01:39:55,710
he drove me as hard,
if not harder than of his other 

2186
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:55,710
students.
He didn't show any favoritism,

2187
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:58,540
but one of the things that was always 
his thing on the mat,

2188
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:02,230
and I'm kind of paraphrasing,
but basically you,

2189
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:07,670
you either win or you learn,
especially in that high school college 

2190
01:40:07,871 --> 01:40:08,430
setting,
you're,

2191
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:10,390
you're,
you're learning about yourself.

2192
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:15,390
If you,
if you went out there and you got your 

2193
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:16,870
ass handed to you and you just got beat 
and didn't learn anything,

2194
01:40:16,871 --> 01:40:18,070
well yeah,
you're a fucking loser.

2195
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:21,310
Take the moment,
reflect on it,

2196
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:25,690
build on what you did wrong and you now 
you're actually gonna wave one.

2197
01:40:26,170 --> 01:40:29,030
Now you know more about yourself.
You know about more your.

2198
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:33,550
Your limitations are what you need to 
improve and expand your talents are your

2199
01:40:33,551 --> 01:40:37,000
limitations.
So I guess whenever I'm doing a thing,

2200
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:42,270
I'm always looking at it from a learning
perspective so there aren't necessarily 

2201
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:45,700
mistakes unless they're fatal and then 
you wouldn't know anyway.

2202
01:40:45,701 --> 01:40:49,210
So whatever that really is the right way
to look at everything.

2203
01:40:49,730 --> 01:40:54,730
When are you learn?
You know you have great experiences 

2204
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:58,621
because you were successful or you have 
very beneficial experiences because you 

2205
01:40:58,621 --> 01:41:01,870
realized what went wrong.
What is this one more wrinkle,

2206
01:41:01,871 --> 01:41:06,871
one more piece of information or 
Glenmore experience that you can add to 

2207
01:41:06,871 --> 01:41:09,580
your database of knowledge and it'll 
make you better at everything.

2208
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,170
So that,
and a lot of ways,

2209
01:41:11,171 --> 01:41:16,171
that's my biggest frustration in life is
when there is something that goes wrong 

2210
01:41:16,171 --> 01:41:20,340
and I can't figure out what it was 
that's frustrating for me because I 

2211
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,280
can't,
I can't build on it.

2212
01:41:21,281 --> 01:41:25,840
I can't learn from it,
but I don't understand what went wrong.

2213
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:31,340
But what was a relationship or whether 
it's something I tried to build or 

2214
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:32,170
something I did or how often does that 
happen?

2215
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:34,540
A lot.
You know,

2216
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:34,930
I,
you know,

2217
01:41:34,931 --> 01:41:39,931
there's a couple of times I've actually 
had an opportunity to do a vocal with 

2218
01:41:39,931 --> 01:41:41,700
somebody else as a guest singer and I,
you know,

2219
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,800
rehearsal was great and then you blew it
for the,

2220
01:41:44,830 --> 01:41:46,600
for the main event.

2221
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:48,400
And I'm like,
what did I do wrong?

2222
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:53,401
I did everything the same and until you 
can actually pinpoint that and figure 

2223
01:41:53,401 --> 01:41:56,530
out what it was,
I'm a fucking mess.

2224
01:41:56,531 --> 01:41:58,960
Like I'm slipping.
I'm waking up in the middle of the night

2225
01:41:58,961 --> 01:42:01,420
trying to figure out what the fuck went 
wrong.

2226
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:03,750
Yeah,
that's the same with comedy cut.

2227
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:08,790
That's one flub joke or one,
one premise that you botched and just 

2228
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:12,010
know you'll wake up.
I'll wake up to pee and go,

2229
01:42:12,011 --> 01:42:13,570
fuck,
you know,

2230
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:18,950
just don't have to go downstairs and get
in front of the computer and just start 

2231
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:19,590
writing again,
you know,

2232
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,090
just get angry at a fix this fucking 
thing.

2233
01:42:22,091 --> 01:42:23,320
I got to figure out what's wrong with 
it.

2234
01:42:23,321 --> 01:42:26,680
I'm going to make it bulletproof.
Yeah.

2235
01:42:26,681 --> 01:42:29,920
It's um,
you're a unique guy in that you,

2236
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:35,220
you're,
you're all these different things that 

2237
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:37,711
you're doing.
I feel like the Kinda like work 

2238
01:42:37,711 --> 01:42:37,711
synergistically to have.

2239
01:42:37,711 --> 01:42:39,180
So yeah.
I don't feel like you're going.

2240
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:40,570
You don't think like you're battling,
you're.

2241
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,340
I know people that are battling 
themselves,

2242
01:42:42,650 --> 01:42:43,870
you know,
with all the different things.

2243
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:46,720
But this all feeds everything.
The stories.

2244
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,540
I'm a storyteller,
so I'm involved in a lot of life.

2245
01:42:49,570 --> 01:42:51,550
I'm trying,
I'm doing things on many,

2246
01:42:51,551 --> 01:42:54,340
many levels because in order to tell a 
full,

2247
01:42:54,790 --> 01:42:56,890
more complete picture,
a better story,

2248
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:02,160
having more information,
a good a good actor is going to do is 

2249
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:03,340
research on the character beyond the 
character is going to find out about the

2250
01:43:03,341 --> 01:43:08,341
region,
the character supposedly from and the 

2251
01:43:08,341 --> 01:43:08,341
history of their family's history.
And you know what,

2252
01:43:08,341 --> 01:43:12,830
they're going to add all these things 
then so that like when they had their 

2253
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:13,780
one line,
all that history is behind their eyes.

2254
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:16,060
So I feel like that's,
you know,

2255
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:18,370
for writing,
for winemaking,

2256
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:24,000
they're all crossing over together.
They're all feeding each other to make 

2257
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,390
it,
to make it a whole presentation.

2258
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:27,310
Yeah.
When you're managing the,

2259
01:43:28,550 --> 01:43:33,550
you know,
a crop of grapes and putting together a 

2260
01:43:33,550 --> 01:43:36,841
wine and you got a restaurant going on,
you're working on your Jujitsu and then 

2261
01:43:36,841 --> 01:43:41,431
you're writing songs,
you're living all these different 

2262
01:43:41,431 --> 01:43:44,851
experiences.
You have so much feeding into your 

2263
01:43:44,851 --> 01:43:47,791
consciousness.
There's so many variables that you're 

2264
01:43:47,791 --> 01:43:50,971
attending to that it just keeps your 
mind sharp and fresh and it creates

2265
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,620
a,
not new necessarily like conflict,

2266
01:43:54,621 --> 01:43:59,621
but the issue is live things that need 
to be figured out and solutions need to 

2267
01:44:00,531 --> 01:44:05,531
be created for problems.
It's not like there's something that 

2268
01:44:05,531 --> 01:44:08,000
happens to certain people.
They get too locked into one thing.

2269
01:44:08,001 --> 01:44:11,870
I feel that they just run out of juice.
They run out of things to discuss.

2270
01:44:11,871 --> 01:44:15,680
They run out of there,
run out of run out of perspective.

2271
01:44:15,930 --> 01:44:16,240
Yeah.

2272
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:18,040
Yeah.
I mean you're,

2273
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:20,700
you know,
during the seventies,

2274
01:44:20,701 --> 01:44:23,220
eighties,
a era of music coming out.

2275
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:26,640
First two records are probably those 
people spent the whole,

2276
01:44:26,641 --> 01:44:31,641
their whole lives writing those two 
records and the third record is all 

2277
01:44:31,641 --> 01:44:34,671
about the bus or the travel or the are 
the shitty record label or a manager.

2278
01:44:37,171 --> 01:44:40,920
Like it's all the road that's the road 
album because,

2279
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:43,680
well where the fuck have they been for 
the last three years,

2280
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:47,250
but in a bus or in an airport and hotel.
So those,

2281
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:52,460
those albums ended up being the ones 
that either make or break the band as 

2282
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:53,080
far as getting past a,
those,

2283
01:44:53,190 --> 01:44:55,650
you know,
in general I'm speaking very generally.

2284
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:56,510
Of course.
Yeah.

2285
01:44:56,640 --> 01:45:01,640
But it's the same with comics.
It's this with comics it's usually you 

2286
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:04,080
have one or two good specials and then 
there's a big drop off.

2287
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:09,860
You know,
I think it's guys run out of stuff to 

2288
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:12,051
talk about and usually you work for like
10 years before you do anything before 

2289
01:45:12,811 --> 01:45:16,620
you release anything that the best guys,
it seems like they worked like 10,

2290
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:21,650
10 years and then they put out an album 
or a comedy special or whatever it is 

2291
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:22,990
and then you just,
your,

2292
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:28,000
your life is about performing,
your life is about doing that and you 

2293
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,850
don't have enough options outside of 
that.

2294
01:45:29,851 --> 01:45:32,850
Like a lot of comics turned to airline 
jokes and you know,

2295
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:36,270
things like hotels and he started 
talking about that.

2296
01:45:36,290 --> 01:45:38,620
Like that's your experience is 
constantly being on the website,

2297
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:40,530
what you're exposed to.
Talk about what you know,

2298
01:45:40,531 --> 01:45:43,250
write what you know and that's what you 
all,

2299
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:45,300
you know now as a fucking delayed 
flight.

2300
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:48,600
But I don't know anybody else is doing 
it your way.

2301
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:52,620
Like rock style way also runs a 
vineyard.

2302
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:56,640
All it's like also regularly changes,
Jujitsu,

2303
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:02,120
a Daniel day,
Lewis sorts of hats or something to make

2304
01:46:02,370 --> 01:46:03,310
shoes.
I have shoes.

2305
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:06,360
Yeah.
Shoes.

2306
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:09,420
I want a pair of Daniel Day Lewis shoes.
Isn't that what he's doing?

2307
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:11,040
I feel like he's making shoes.

2308
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:11,760
Well,
I don't know.

2309
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:16,770
A lot of actors I've taught here have 
met that have gotten on a roll with a 

2310
01:46:17,421 --> 01:46:19,940
good series,
a TV series.

2311
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:23,720
A lot of them will say the same thing,
like about a couple of seasons in.

2312
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:28,990
He started looking at the door because 
you're acting muscles start to atrophy 

2313
01:46:29,210 --> 01:46:34,210
if you're only being this guy on that 
show for eight years.

2314
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:38,280
Do they start going crazy and going into
drugs and buying houses?

2315
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:39,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

2316
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:44,990
So you start to,
you start to get a little spiral so you 

2317
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:44,990
know,
to get out and be able to do a few films

2318
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:48,600
a lot.
Alec William Peterson was on CSI,

2319
01:46:48,601 --> 01:46:52,440
the CSR forever.
He's does theater now.

2320
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:54,660
Yeah,
I would think you would have to.

2321
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:56,710
That's the guy from to live and die in 
La.

2322
01:46:56,710 --> 01:46:58,030
Yup.
I forgot about that movie.

2323
01:46:58,031 --> 01:46:59,760
And Hunter Peep.
Yeah.

2324
01:46:59,761 --> 01:47:04,761
That was the original Hannibal Lecter 
movie with a different Guy Than Anthony 

2325
01:47:04,761 --> 01:47:04,761
Hopkins.
It was a great movie.

2326
01:47:04,761 --> 01:47:06,180
Great.
Forgotten.

2327
01:47:06,181 --> 01:47:09,170
Moving to live in Dianella is a 
forgotten movie.

2328
01:47:09,171 --> 01:47:13,860
That is a great fucking movie.
Brian Cox is Dr Lecter and there he is.

2329
01:47:14,030 --> 01:47:15,780
Handsome faster back then.
Yeah,

2330
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:20,990
look at him and he's just his sharpening
his chops on the theater stage because 

2331
01:47:20,990 --> 01:47:25,641
a,
he's a true that guys that got the real 

2332
01:47:25,641 --> 01:47:27,900
deal,
but he's on CSI to get paid.

2333
01:47:29,210 --> 01:47:34,210
Yeah,
I guess initially I think most likely 

2334
01:47:34,210 --> 01:47:35,460
when that,
when that whole new era of TV was coming

2335
01:47:35,461 --> 01:47:38,160
out as it probably seemed like a good 
idea for him to kind of just,

2336
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:40,560
you know,
it probably had some bills to pay and he

2337
01:47:40,561 --> 01:47:42,170
wants you to get on their taking.

2338
01:47:42,190 --> 01:47:47,190
It was going to be a couple seasons.
It's just going to get out of their 

2339
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:48,480
contract and they're going to keep you 
around if you do this,

2340
01:47:48,530 --> 01:47:53,530
but I want to do this theater thing.
I want to go do Shakespeare in the park 

2341
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:54,730
and they'll punish you if you leave too.
Yeah,

2342
01:47:55,170 --> 01:48:00,170
the black volume.
This motherfucker will leave a series 

2343
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:00,170
when it's.
Yeah,

2344
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:00,810
so ruined does.
I don't know.

2345
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:01,680
I don't know.
I don't know him.

2346
01:48:01,681 --> 01:48:06,681
I don't know his decisions,
but I think a speaking to a lot of 

2347
01:48:06,681 --> 01:48:06,990
different people that have been in this 
situation,

2348
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:09,400
it's definitely,
yeah,

2349
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:12,240
you kind of waited it out.
Like if I just stick with this thing for

2350
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:13,770
six seasons,
eight seasons,

2351
01:48:13,771 --> 01:48:15,780
I have enough money in the bank for the 
rest of my life,

2352
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:17,620
you know,
uh,

2353
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:21,390
and then I'll have to fight my way back 
a couple of years,

2354
01:48:21,550 --> 01:48:24,870
uh,
of detoxing from that very.

2355
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:27,270
It could be a great situation because 
you have.

2356
01:48:27,290 --> 01:48:29,910
Well,
I think it makes people go crazy.

2357
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:31,800
I think that's what happened at Johnny 
Depp.

2358
01:48:32,630 --> 01:48:37,630
You know,
Johnny Depp when he started doing those 

2359
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:37,630
pirates of the Caribbean movies.
You know,

2360
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:37,630
it's interesting like Johnny Depp at one
point in time and I'm,

2361
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:39,540
I'm a Johnny Depp Fan.
I think he's a great actor.

2362
01:48:39,870 --> 01:48:44,870
Seems like a wild dude.
He's buddies with my friend Stan hope 

2363
01:48:44,870 --> 01:48:44,880
and standup loves him,
so he's got to be a good guy.

2364
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,770
Have a lot of mutual friends.
I've never actually,

2365
01:48:47,010 --> 01:48:48,180
I met him a long,
long,

2366
01:48:48,181 --> 01:48:48,990
long,
long time ago,

2367
01:48:48,991 --> 01:48:50,030
but I don't,
I don't.

2368
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:50,940
Yeah.

2369
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:55,030
He used to do these weird projects,
strange movies,

2370
01:48:55,031 --> 01:48:56,650
and he.
He even said once,

2371
01:48:56,651 --> 01:48:59,320
I don't want to be blockbuster.
Blockbuster boy.

2372
01:48:59,321 --> 01:49:00,010
Yeah,
dead man.

2373
01:49:00,130 --> 01:49:01,510
That black and white.
Yeah.

2374
01:49:01,511 --> 01:49:04,180
That black and white western Arizona 
dream checked that one out.

2375
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:05,170
That's right.
Yeah.

2376
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:07,360
Fantastic.
He did a lot of really cool,

2377
01:49:07,361 --> 01:49:12,361
weird projects and then he did the 
pirates of the Caribbean and that 

2378
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:17,580
fucking group of movies has been so 
wildly successful that he's just made 

2379
01:49:19,150 --> 01:49:24,150
ungodly amounts of money to the point 
where he was spending so much fucking 

2380
01:49:24,150 --> 01:49:28,741
money.
They had some breakdown because he's 

2381
01:49:28,741 --> 01:49:29,140
involved in some lawsuit with his former
manager there.

2382
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:33,280
As soon as former manager,
he was spending $150,000

2383
01:49:33,281 --> 01:49:35,550
a month on private security.
Twenty four hours a day,

2384
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:38,950
spending $200,000
a month on private jets and they're just

2385
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:42,100
going on and on and on.
He had a staff of 40 people.

2386
01:49:42,430 --> 01:49:45,220
He managed fund.
No Johnny Depp.

2387
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:46,750
Johnny Depp.
A staff of 40 people,

2388
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:48,130
something

2389
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:50,980
like 15 different homes all over the 
world.

2390
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:53,460
Just Paul

2391
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:56,910
went out of control too,
so balling out of control.

2392
01:49:58,190 --> 01:50:01,130
Korean fulcan corner.
Not we could bring him in.

2393
01:50:01,131 --> 01:50:06,131
Now.
What is this among his mobile six 

2394
01:50:06,131 --> 01:50:06,480
traveling expenses listed in a 
countersuit where $3,000,000

2395
01:50:06,481 --> 01:50:11,370
spent to blast hunter Thompson's ashes 
out of a cannon and $30,000

2396
01:50:11,371 --> 01:50:14,070
a month spend on wine.
The New York Post Gossip column.

2397
01:50:14,071 --> 01:50:15,300
Page six report.
Yeah.

2398
01:50:15,301 --> 01:50:17,820
Well they're the same concept.
Said that Ronda Rousey and Travis Browne

2399
01:50:17,821 --> 01:50:19,120
are washed up losers.
Yeah.

2400
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:21,270
I don't know if they're right.
What does this house they're showing?

2401
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:26,480
Hey though,
let's talk about paid blow up like the 

2402
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,910
world trade Johnny Depp Chateau in the 
south of France.

2403
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:34,620
Who buys the shot to have a restaurant 
with an awning and a logo on it.

2404
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:38,070
That doesn't even make sense.
Does it have his own restaurant?

2405
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:41,700
How ball or they're overthinking it?
Maybe it's a restaurant.

2406
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,740
Yeah,
but I mean like for himself only.

2407
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:46,200
He shows up a table for two.

2408
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:49,530
Sir,
can I get on the list?

2409
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:52,380
Strange character.
He's a strange character.

2410
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:57,800
I think that's what happened.
He started buying all that shit when he 

2411
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,320
got that pirates of the Caribbean money 
because you don't really want to be Jack

2412
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:01,140
Sparrow every fucking day.
Like I want to do something else.

2413
01:51:01,141 --> 01:51:03,240
You can't do something else.
And every time he does something else,

2414
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:08,350
it just doesn't really work.
It doesn't really work like the pirates 

2415
01:51:08,350 --> 01:51:08,480
of the Caribbean guide does,
you know,

2416
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:13,490
like how many different movies is he 
done since you've done the pirates of 

2417
01:51:13,490 --> 01:51:13,490
the Caribbean?
Couple.

2418
01:51:13,490 --> 01:51:14,530
Couple?
Yeah,

2419
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:16,320
that's right.
He did Edward Scissorhands.

2420
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:21,980
Oh No,
he did the Alice in wonderland thing 

2421
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:21,980
since the pirates of the Caribbean.
That was actually really good.

2422
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:22,920
It was weird.
I enjoyed it,

2423
01:51:22,921 --> 01:51:24,010
but I enjoyed it.
Yeah.

2424
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:26,670
Well they want go.
Yeah.

2425
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:32,250
There's a lot of weird shit.
Anyway,

2426
01:51:32,730 --> 01:51:35,100
point being,
they go crazy.

2427
01:51:35,550 --> 01:51:37,530
They just start.
They start spending,

2428
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:41,820
buying stopped buying and spending to 
get caught now where?

2429
01:51:41,821 --> 01:51:46,821
Howard Hughes and a downward spiral.
What does this movie tonto and the lone 

2430
01:51:47,761 --> 01:51:48,720
ranger.
That's right.

2431
01:51:48,810 --> 01:51:53,810
The 10 worst Johnny Depp movie.
Wasn't that a guy that died and came 

2432
01:51:54,271 --> 01:51:57,390
back to life or something like that or 
he had the lone ranger come back to life

2433
01:51:57,540 --> 01:52:00,750
and it helped him come back to life 
comes back to life or something.

2434
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:06,050
I think that's cultural appropriation 
because I don't believe that he's 

2435
01:52:06,050 --> 01:52:06,050
Indian,
so I'm offended.

2436
01:52:06,050 --> 01:52:09,530
How come they couldn't get a native 
American Indian?

2437
01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:11,910
Yeah,
that's A.

2438
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:13,200
Yeah.
I have a hard time with all that.

2439
01:52:13,210 --> 01:52:14,970
I'm know what.
So.

2440
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:17,550
Okay.
You have you own guns?

2441
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:18,350
Yes.
Okay.

2442
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:19,830
But you're,
you know,

2443
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,150
you're a pot smoker,
a your.

2444
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:24,000
Would you consider yourself a liberal?

2445
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:26,130
A more liberal than I am conservative 
for sure.

2446
01:52:26,150 --> 01:52:27,060
Okay.
So there's,

2447
01:52:27,061 --> 01:52:28,310
there's that balance.
Um,

2448
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:32,850
you think the make ribs like that,
you know,

2449
01:52:33,390 --> 01:52:36,170
don't call me.
I would like to be now from out,

2450
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:36,450
you know,
I'm,

2451
01:52:36,490 --> 01:52:37,650
I'm an,
I'm an avocado,

2452
01:52:37,651 --> 01:52:40,890
I relate to avocado.
So as my,

2453
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:43,890
my sexuality,
I relate to an avocado.

2454
01:52:43,891 --> 01:52:48,891
So.
And don't think you're allowed to 

2455
01:52:48,891 --> 01:52:48,891
identify as an avocado now.
Okay.

2456
01:52:48,891 --> 01:52:51,230
So that,
that thing just,

2457
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:52,720
you know,
there's,

2458
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:57,790
again,
we need a meteor I guess when it comes 

2459
01:52:57,790 --> 01:52:59,480
to talking about guns and avocado,
but like you know,

2460
01:52:59,570 --> 01:53:02,510
just that whole the politically correct 
thing,

2461
01:53:02,511 --> 01:53:07,511
but then the anti electric intellectual 
ism that comes from what I would 

2462
01:53:07,511 --> 01:53:08,420
consider the lower.
Right?

2463
01:53:08,470 --> 01:53:10,910
Yeah,
there's a far right that it does go anti

2464
01:53:10,911 --> 01:53:15,470
intellectual ism and then there's far 
left that even though they might be more

2465
01:53:15,471 --> 01:53:20,471
well read and maybe intellectual,
they put up these blinders to a certain 

2466
01:53:20,471 --> 01:53:21,650
patterns of thinking as well.

2467
01:53:21,650 --> 01:53:26,650
I mean there's,
there's not a lot of like across the 

2468
01:53:26,650 --> 01:53:29,231
board objectivity,
there's a lot of people formulating 

2469
01:53:29,231 --> 01:53:32,291
these preformed patterns of opinions 
that conservative opinions and just 

2470
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:35,690
clinging to it or liberal opinions and 
cleaning to it.

2471
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:38,430
I think there's no gray area.
Yeah,

2472
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:41,600
I think most people media lots of gray.
A lot of gray area.

2473
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:42,790
Yeah.
Meteor.

2474
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:47,860
I think most people really share like 
ideas that are conservative and liberal 

2475
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:50,120
and I think what's really important,
we should be able to discuss these ideas

2476
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:54,530
without digging our heels and just being
fully committed to one team or the other

2477
01:53:54,531 --> 01:53:56,060
team.
That's where the problem lies.

2478
01:53:56,210 --> 01:54:00,140
People would so tribal,
whether it's conservative or liberal,

2479
01:54:00,141 --> 01:54:05,141
even libertarian,
they go real tribal and they just like 

2480
01:54:05,141 --> 01:54:08,150
lock onto those ideas and this is right 
and that is wrong and you know,

2481
01:54:08,151 --> 01:54:09,590
and it just.
People don't want.

2482
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:14,800
They don't want to give in and so then 
they fight and they dig their heels in 

2483
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:15,050
and they know they fight their opinion.

2484
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:17,460
I'm an arm snowflake.
Is that,

2485
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:19,400
is that a new category?
You could do that.

2486
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:21,050
Yeah.
Should be able to do that.

2487
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:26,110
Why not?
So who could stop you from being an 

2488
01:54:26,110 --> 01:54:26,110
snowflake?
You have bullets and shit.

2489
01:54:26,110 --> 01:54:27,740
You know,
regular snowflakes don't have bullets.

2490
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:30,220
Superman.
I think,

2491
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:32,370
man,
I think we're,

2492
01:54:32,371 --> 01:54:37,371
we're moving into a new stage of 
humanity is as profound and ridiculous 

2493
01:54:37,371 --> 01:54:39,110
and you know,
verbose as that sounds.

2494
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:44,980
I really think that's what's going on 
and I think all this in fighting and 

2495
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:45,200
squabbling is we're trying to find our 
footing,

2496
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:50,770
trying to figure out what we are and 
what we're doing and guns are part of 

2497
01:54:50,770 --> 01:54:50,770
that.
It's like,

2498
01:54:50,770 --> 01:54:53,420
should you be allowed to just have that?
Like I don't know.

2499
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:55,250
Every now and then it goes wrong.
Well,

2500
01:54:55,251 --> 01:55:00,251
if it goes wrong,
what do you want to be able to protect 

2501
01:55:00,251 --> 01:55:00,251
yourself?
Yeah,

2502
01:55:00,251 --> 01:55:00,251
you got a point.

2503
01:55:00,251 --> 01:55:00,251
No,
you don't have a point.

2504
01:55:00,251 --> 01:55:02,930
No one should have one you have,
but what about when the bad people come?

2505
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:04,870
Should you have one then?
No,

2506
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:07,360
she just let the bad people will kill 
you and then it's all bad people.

2507
01:55:07,361 --> 01:55:10,370
I've had the good people are dead.
Well who's that?

2508
01:55:10,490 --> 01:55:15,490
Who's to determine what.
If a person gets a hold of it and they 

2509
01:55:15,490 --> 01:55:16,410
do a bad thing,
like there's all these variables but I,

2510
01:55:16,411 --> 01:55:21,411
I don't think.
I don't think it's that cut and dry and 

2511
01:55:21,411 --> 01:55:22,290
I also think it's a lot like everything 
else here.

2512
01:55:22,580 --> 01:55:27,580
Media or maybe what part if you were 
looking at a part of the world without 

2513
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:30,950
pissing anybody off without,
without pissing anybody off,

2514
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:34,550
we're not going to care.
There's like a billion people so we lost

2515
01:55:34,551 --> 01:55:39,551
a half a million fucking mouth.
It would have to wipe out like lot via

2516
01:55:44,710 --> 01:55:45,210
like okay,

2517
01:55:45,330 --> 01:55:46,830
boom.
And then

2518
01:55:46,930 --> 01:55:49,200
baird or like have you seen,
did you,

2519
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:51,480
had you watched the leftovers?
Yes,

2520
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,410
I watched the first episode.
Yeah,

2521
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:54,300
it's,
I,

2522
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:55,280
I like,
you know,

2523
01:55:55,281 --> 01:55:56,910
I think the I love,
I love,

2524
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,830
I love watching actors,
actors,

2525
01:55:58,890 --> 01:56:00,620
flexor their missile.
I love it.

2526
01:56:00,621 --> 01:56:05,621
So I love that series because you get 
better after the first episode that 

2527
01:56:05,621 --> 01:56:05,940
looks set in a bunch of stuff up.
Yeah,

2528
01:56:05,990 --> 01:56:08,630
I mean as a lot of setup,
but just the concept right away,

2529
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:10,760
storyteller.
I love the a good story.

2530
01:56:11,450 --> 01:56:16,010
A huge percentage of the population just
fucking vanishes with no explanation.

2531
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:19,970
I'm in.
I'm in and all the psychological and all

2532
01:56:19,971 --> 01:56:24,971
the religious stuff that unfolds and 
collapses and builds up and freaks out 

2533
01:56:24,971 --> 01:56:29,590
based on that.
I think if we're going to do something 

2534
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:29,590
like that,
uh,

2535
01:56:29,590 --> 01:56:34,240
it would have to be spontaneous 
combustion from a percentage of the 

2536
01:56:34,791 --> 01:56:38,120
globe across the board.
No,

2537
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:39,970
no,
no.

2538
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:41,780
There's burst into flames.
Yeah.

2539
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:46,960
That's a real thing.
If five percent of the population 

2540
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:49,990
spontaneously combusting at the same 
time across the globe in front of 

2541
01:56:51,111 --> 01:56:53,900
people.
And no explanation,

2542
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:56,150
no explanation.
Now we're going to talk.

2543
01:56:56,510 --> 01:56:58,820
I don't think that's enough.
I think it's gotTa.

2544
01:56:58,890 --> 01:57:00,830
Something's gotta hit us because then 
you'd be like,

2545
01:57:00,831 --> 01:57:02,900
well,
obviously camp,

2546
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:04,400
you want to see people maybe

2547
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:10,980
fuck you and fuck your hits.
I'm all for people at Penn and spuntech 

2548
01:57:12,220 --> 01:57:17,220
member when we're kids.
Like spontaneous combustion was a thing 

2549
01:57:17,220 --> 01:57:21,030
he would wonder,
maybe one of your friends will burst 

2550
01:57:21,030 --> 01:57:21,450
into flames while you're in school.
They they're lighting farts or something

2551
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:25,060
that real spontaneous human combustion.
Is it truly real?

2552
01:57:25,150 --> 01:57:30,150
I don't know how spontaneous human 
combustion works can make that a little 

2553
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:30,150
bigger so I can read it.
And December 19,

2554
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:35,101
66,
the body of a 96 year old dr j Dot 

2555
01:57:35,101 --> 01:57:37,720
Irving Bentley would discovered in his 
Pennsylvania home by a meter reader,

2556
01:57:37,990 --> 01:57:42,990
actually only part of Dr.
Bentley's leg and slippered foot were 

2557
01:57:42,990 --> 01:57:47,191
found.
The rest of his body had been burned to 

2558
01:57:47,191 --> 01:57:49,381
ashes.
A hole in the bathroom floor was the 

2559
01:57:49,381 --> 01:57:49,381
only evidence of the fire that had 
killed him.

2560
01:57:49,381 --> 01:57:50,890
The rest of the house remained perfectly
intact.

2561
01:57:51,250 --> 01:57:56,250
How could a man catch fire with no 
apparent source of a spark or flame and 

2562
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:59,641
then burns so completely without 
igniting anything around him said the 

2563
01:57:59,641 --> 01:57:59,641
Washington Post?

2564
01:57:59,641 --> 01:58:00,040
Yeah,
Dr.

2565
01:58:00,130 --> 01:58:05,130
Bentley's case in several hundred others
like it have been labeled spontaneous 

2566
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:09,721
human combustion,
although he and other victims of the 

2567
01:58:09,721 --> 01:58:12,781
phenomena burned almost completely their
surroundings and the even sometimes 

2568
01:58:12,781 --> 01:58:13,960
they're close remained virtually 
untouched.

2569
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:16,240
Well,
that's just fucking bullshit.

2570
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:18,010
Who?
What website is this?

2571
01:58:18,190 --> 01:58:19,640
Listen Bitch.
If you're on fire,

2572
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:22,060
you're fucking clothes are going to 
catch fire too.

2573
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:25,990
Unless someone's using pixie magic on 
you or they did.

2574
01:58:25,991 --> 01:58:28,870
You get hit with a magic wand wielded by
an Elf.

2575
01:58:28,871 --> 01:58:32,410
You've cut your fucking clothes are 
gonna burn stupid.

2576
01:58:32,411 --> 01:58:34,090
If you're burning,
your clothes are burning.

2577
01:58:34,091 --> 01:58:36,970
This is horseshit sciences.
Okay?

2578
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:40,360
If spontaneous human combustion isn't 
real,

2579
01:58:40,420 --> 01:58:45,420
then what?
Really to the many pictures that exist 

2580
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:47,701
of charred bodies,
a possible explanation is the wick 

2581
01:58:47,701 --> 01:58:49,951
effect which produces proposes that the 
body when lit by a cigarette smoldering 

2582
01:58:50,051 --> 01:58:54,310
ember or other heat source acts,
much like an inside out candle,

2583
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:59,820
a candle is composed of a wick on the 
inside surrounded by a wax made of 

2584
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:03,870
flammable fatty acids.
The wax ignites the wick and keeps it 

2585
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:07,201
burning in the human body.
The body's fat acts as a flammable 

2586
01:59:07,201 --> 01:59:10,531
substance,
and the victim's clothing or hail here 

2587
01:59:10,531 --> 01:59:11,920
acts as the wic.
As the fat melt from the heat.

2588
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:17,220
It's soaks into the clothing and acts as
a wax like substance to keep the wick 

2589
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:17,320
burning.
Slowly.

2590
01:59:17,321 --> 01:59:22,321
Scientists say,
this is why the victims bodies are 

2591
01:59:22,321 --> 01:59:22,510
destroyed,
yet their surroundings are barely burnt.

2592
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:27,990
Whoa,
so they're so fat that we become like a 

2593
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:31,470
big greasy candle says no one's.
No one's ever conclusively proven or 

2594
01:59:31,631 --> 01:59:32,980
disproven the truth,

2595
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:38,200
spontaneous human combustion,
but most scientists say that there are 

2596
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:41,801
more likely explanations for the charred
remains like your wife fucking hates 

2597
01:59:41,801 --> 01:59:46,511
you.
She hates you in the head with a frying 

2598
01:59:46,511 --> 01:59:48,191
pan.
Let your ass on fire through you in the 

2599
01:59:48,191 --> 01:59:48,191
tub and say,
I don't even know what happened.

2600
01:59:48,191 --> 01:59:49,750
I think it's one of them.
Ripley's believe it or not thing,

2601
01:59:51,890 --> 01:59:56,890
and then you know,
she seen in the embrace of the hardware 

2602
01:59:56,890 --> 01:59:59,761
store manager.
I was crying and Stanley help me 

2603
01:59:59,761 --> 02:00:01,810
watching the tick.
I don't think it's real.

2604
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:04,180
I cried bullshit.
That's why,

2605
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:07,930
and that's why it would make so much 
more of an impact if it happened to five

2606
02:00:07,931 --> 02:00:11,260
percent of the population.
I think an outside threat,

2607
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:15,520
if another planet like an impact is like
a wakeup call and outs,

2608
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:20,640
like spontaneous seeming alien showed up
and started shooting people from 

2609
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:22,030
spaceships,
everyone's going to go,

2610
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:23,920
that's bullshit.
That's the government.

2611
02:00:24,130 --> 02:00:25,990
Could be right,
but an asteroid,

2612
02:00:25,991 --> 02:00:29,050
you realize the government cannot 
recreate something the size of a city.

2613
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:33,850
It's slamming into the planet.
That's what going to happen.

2614
02:00:35,710 --> 02:00:36,940
Yeah,
but it's weird

2615
02:00:37,330 --> 02:00:41,050
care.
We care in a big way how people die,

2616
02:00:41,110 --> 02:00:46,110
right?
Like nine slash 11 was huge because 

2617
02:00:46,110 --> 02:00:48,540
people caused 3000 people to die and the
world changed radically because of those

2618
02:00:50,021 --> 02:00:54,970
3000 deaths.
But half a million people die every year

2619
02:00:54,971 --> 02:00:59,971
because of cigarettes.
A half a million just in this country 

2620
02:00:59,971 --> 02:00:59,971
alone.
And we're like,

2621
02:00:59,971 --> 02:00:59,971
yeah,
yeah,

2622
02:00:59,971 --> 02:00:59,971
yeah.
Whatever.

2623
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,620
Like it doesn't bother us.
Like you die that way.

2624
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:03,350
Well your die.
I'm

2625
02:01:03,650 --> 02:01:08,650
choking on your,
on pus filled lungs in some sort of 

2626
02:01:08,930 --> 02:01:11,750
urgent care center.
That doesn't bother us as much.

2627
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:12,970
Like,
that's Ah,

2628
02:01:12,971 --> 02:01:17,971
I shouldn't have smoked,
but you get caught in the 500th floor of

2629
02:01:18,981 --> 02:01:21,530
some fucking skyscraper and get hit in 
the face.

2630
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:23,960
There's a,
there's some good.

2631
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:27,510
There's a lot of good books on those 
kinds of things that,

2632
02:01:27,620 --> 02:01:28,040
that,
uh,

2633
02:01:28,710 --> 02:01:30,080
uh,
just,

2634
02:01:30,210 --> 02:01:32,810
you know,
something like the Holocaust in general,

2635
02:01:32,811 --> 02:01:37,550
just the intent and the focus and the 
hatred toward a specific group of people

2636
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:41,930
has way more than the cigarette.
The cigarette smoke,

2637
02:01:41,931 --> 02:01:44,900
the cigarettes don't have,
they're not angry.

2638
02:01:44,901 --> 02:01:47,930
They're not hateful,
so that death is not.

2639
02:01:48,110 --> 02:01:48,730
It doesn't,
you don't.

2640
02:01:48,940 --> 02:01:52,300
It doesn't hurt you as much as if you 
had the,

2641
02:01:52,410 --> 02:01:57,410
the impact of a group of people hating 
another group of people so much that 

2642
02:01:57,410 --> 02:02:00,230
they,
they killed them in a mass,

2643
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:01,460
you know,
on a massive event.

2644
02:02:01,550 --> 02:02:04,610
It's kind of insidious though,
if you really look at it objectively,

2645
02:02:04,611 --> 02:02:09,611
look,
it's okay as long as they peacefully 

2646
02:02:09,611 --> 02:02:11,891
suck the vitality of your body with 
chemical dip plants wrapped in paper 

2647
02:02:14,270 --> 02:02:19,270
that they trick you into sucking on.
Once you light them on fire and your 

2648
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:20,780
body becomes accustomed and addicted to 
it.

2649
02:02:20,781 --> 02:02:21,560
And we're like,
hey,

2650
02:02:21,561 --> 02:02:24,320
it's a,
it's a stress relieving choice.

2651
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,660
Great.
Don't smoke too much.

2652
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:29,420
Just as long as you only smoke a little.
That'd be fun.

2653
02:02:30,130 --> 02:02:32,390
What are the statistics?
It's that like secondhand.

2654
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:35,600
Secondhand is bad to people,
waitresses and stuff,

2655
02:02:35,610 --> 02:02:39,230
and in bars they would get,
a lot of them will get cancer and people

2656
02:02:39,231 --> 02:02:41,330
that lived with people that were chronic
smokers,

2657
02:02:41,331 --> 02:02:43,670
but they weren't smokers themselves.
A lot of them got cancer.

2658
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:49,060
Secondhand smoke,
especially in a small enclosed area is 

2659
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:51,281
real as fuck.
It's not as bad as the cigarettes 

2660
02:02:51,281 --> 02:02:54,281
themselves,
but we should have seen the first clue 

2661
02:02:54,281 --> 02:02:56,900
would have been like as soon as they 
soon as they pulled smoking off of 

2662
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:56,900
planes like,
oh,

2663
02:02:57,460 --> 02:03:01,590
that must be a problem to the planes are
riddick because you're having to pay for

2664
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:03,050
some flight attendants.

2665
02:03:03,230 --> 02:03:04,970
Cancer.
Yeah.

2666
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,920
That would be why those things were 
ridiculous.

2667
02:03:06,921 --> 02:03:10,310
I remember they used to smoke in the 
back end.

2668
02:03:10,311 --> 02:03:14,930
If you smoking non nonsmoking section 
separated by space,

2669
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:17,570
that's it.
Separated and a tube.

2670
02:03:17,770 --> 02:03:21,110
Second hand smoke causes approximately 
7,333

2671
02:03:21,111 --> 02:03:26,111
deaths from lung cancer and 33,950
deaths from heart disease every year and

2672
02:03:26,930 --> 02:03:31,930
64 and 2014 to two point $5.
Million people died from exposure to 

2673
02:03:32,481 --> 02:03:34,820
secondhand smoke,
so it's not quite as bad.

2674
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:36,500
It's about,
you know,

2675
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:40,220
20,000
as opposed to 500,000,

2676
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,870
but still it's terrible lot.
Yeah.

2677
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:46,460
It's not as bad,
but it's still fucking terrible.

2678
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:48,870
It's weird.
He's not a.

2679
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:50,130
he's like searching.
What do,

2680
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:50,800
what are you doing?
Well,

2681
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:51,990
we're not talking about.
Sorry.

2682
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:55,580
Are you constantly on his phone?
Hey Siri,

2683
02:03:56,570 --> 02:03:58,190
what's going on with satellites?
Are they real?

2684
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,470
Hey Siri.
What's up with that?

2685
02:04:00,610 --> 02:04:03,770
ICEFALL and Erica.
Big Chunks of.

2686
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:05,660
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2687
02:04:05,870 --> 02:04:08,840
There's a fucking chunk of ice that they
had been monitoring.

2688
02:04:08,870 --> 02:04:13,870
A glacier.
That's the biggest glacier of the world 

2689
02:04:13,870 --> 02:04:16,481
has ever known is the size of Delaware 
and it's floating around in the ocean 

2690
02:04:16,481 --> 02:04:19,760
now.
It is so unbelievably massive.

2691
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:23,630
You could be standing on this glacier 
and not see the end of it.

2692
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:27,530
You wouldn't see how far it goes and 
it's floating in this iceberg,

2693
02:04:27,540 --> 02:04:29,390
I should say.
It's floating.

2694
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:35,560
It broke off.
10 things that are smaller than this 

2695
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:37,500
iceberg.
Jesus Christ.

2696
02:04:37,501 --> 02:04:38,010
It's so

2697
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:40,650
big.
It's Grand Canyon.

2698
02:04:41,300 --> 02:04:44,760
The Grand Canyon is smaller.
The Great Salt Lake is smaller.

2699
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:48,270
Long Island is smaller Luxembourg.
A smaller lake.

2700
02:04:48,271 --> 02:04:53,190
Okeechobee in Florida is smaller.
Los Angeles is smaller than this fucking

2701
02:04:53,191 --> 02:04:58,191
iceberg lake champlain in New York as 
smaller New York City is smaller than 

2702
02:04:58,261 --> 02:05:03,261
this fucking earthquake or earthquake.
This iceberg that.

2703
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:07,200
That's a sane.
So it's separated.

2704
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,450
Do they have a satellite image of this 
thing?

2705
02:05:10,330 --> 02:05:15,330
It's separated and floated off and it's 
going to come slamming right into the 

2706
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:18,380
Santa Monica pier that you could see it 
as they fly over it.

2707
02:05:19,230 --> 02:05:21,840
Oh my God.
Look at that photo.

2708
02:05:21,841 --> 02:05:25,950
That's fucking insane.
The photo is a.

2709
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:31,010
someone took it from a plane.
You're looking down with the wings and 

2710
02:05:31,010 --> 02:05:32,310
where was it?
Was it in Greenland?

2711
02:05:32,410 --> 02:05:35,070
Where were to break off and Arctica.
Arctica.

2712
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:38,920
Is that the ice wall?
Which separates us and flatter.

2713
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:42,780
There's all these assholes and so you 
can't fly over Antarctica online.

2714
02:05:42,810 --> 02:05:44,490
You absolutely can.
You piece of shit.

2715
02:05:44,900 --> 02:05:47,400
Not only that,
Anthony Bourdain just filmed a show from

2716
02:05:47,401 --> 02:05:48,720
there.
He was in Antarctica.

2717
02:05:48,721 --> 02:05:51,060
You dumped cons.
He filmed the show.

2718
02:05:51,250 --> 02:05:53,940
You landed in Antarctica.
He talked to the people that work in the

2719
02:05:53,941 --> 02:05:56,760
science department there.
Whatever the fuck they do,

2720
02:05:56,850 --> 02:06:01,850
running experiments.
Try and keep the Russians from invading 

2721
02:06:01,850 --> 02:06:03,020
all that.
Yeah,

2722
02:06:04,650 --> 02:06:06,360
get them up to.
We should get up to jerome.

2723
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:07,890
Jerome.
Yeah,

2724
02:06:07,950 --> 02:06:12,950
let's get them to come try the wine or 
take them out of the vineyards and we 

2725
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:14,520
have to training to with him.
Huh?

2726
02:06:15,250 --> 02:06:17,880
I think it'd be a good,
a good show to combine them.

2727
02:06:17,881 --> 02:06:19,140
The wine,
the pasta,

2728
02:06:19,141 --> 02:06:20,610
the,
the local food.

2729
02:06:20,670 --> 02:06:22,540
I sense competitive aggression from,
you know,

2730
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:24,600
you're sensing that because you're 
projecting it.

2731
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:26,970
No,
no,

2732
02:06:27,150 --> 02:06:28,090
I'm good.
No,

2733
02:06:28,750 --> 02:06:33,750
I think think track anymore.
I'm not that guy in a bar at a thousand 

2734
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:36,900
dollars glass of wine.

2735
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:40,050
That to definitely get them up there and
get them some good.

2736
02:06:40,090 --> 02:06:42,600
He would do it for sure.
He would film at your place.

2737
02:06:42,601 --> 02:06:46,230
It'd be a good thing to do.
Maybe I could helped orchestrate that.

2738
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:48,630
That'd be a dopey,
dopey,

2739
02:06:48,770 --> 02:06:52,260
a dove.
That'd be a Dopa episode for a show,

2740
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:57,740
you know.
And you also have a very unique story 

2741
02:06:57,740 --> 02:06:59,751
too,
like doing your thing out there in 

2742
02:06:59,751 --> 02:07:01,491
Arizona and look man,
for him it's an opportunity to do some 

2743
02:07:01,491 --> 02:07:01,650
Jujitsu.
That guy's an addict.

2744
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:03,540
He does it every day.
Yeah.

2745
02:07:03,541 --> 02:07:04,590
He's amazing.
Yeah.

2746
02:07:04,591 --> 02:07:07,200
When we were in Montana,
we filmed an episode of his show.

2747
02:07:07,201 --> 02:07:10,320
He went to a.
maybe it was Bozeman,

2748
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:15,480
I think it was Bozeman.
He just found some local Jujitsu club 

2749
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:15,480
was rolling with these guys.
He didn't even know him.

2750
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:17,190
He gets in there and started training 
with him.

2751
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:18,810
He's an animal.
That's awesome.

2752
02:07:18,930 --> 02:07:21,850
He doesn't fuck around.
He does it out overseas to like one 80.

2753
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:23,550
Well,
he's very tall.

2754
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:27,570
I think he's like at least six,
three and he's thin.

2755
02:07:27,630 --> 02:07:31,410
He's lost a ton of weight.
He lost 30 pounds from doing Jujitsu.

2756
02:07:31,590 --> 02:07:34,920
He was on all sorts of WHO's on statens 
for high blood,

2757
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:35,980
high

2758
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:40,180
cholesterol because of his diet and 
sedentary lifestyle and you know,

2759
02:07:40,181 --> 02:07:40,930
he's like,
well,

2760
02:07:40,990 --> 02:07:45,990
you know,
I have the choice between changing what 

2761
02:07:45,990 --> 02:07:47,170
I eat right and I don't want to do that.
I want to keep eating pork and all these

2762
02:07:47,171 --> 02:07:52,171
delicious foods or taking these stat.
And so we just decided to take the 

2763
02:07:52,171 --> 02:07:52,180
statens,
but once he started training Jujitsu,

2764
02:07:52,181 --> 02:07:53,430
he got off all that shit.
Yeah.

2765
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:56,410
Just his body just responded to the 
demands.

2766
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:57,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

2767
02:07:57,790 --> 02:07:59,760
Your body responds to the demands,
you know?

2768
02:07:59,850 --> 02:08:04,850
I think that's one of the,
an unheralded factors in people's 

2769
02:08:04,850 --> 02:08:09,010
obesity is not just the Diet,
which is a huge factor for sure,

2770
02:08:09,011 --> 02:08:11,410
but also the requirements that you're 
asking of your body.

2771
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:14,520
Only the bodies are not used to sitting 
around doing nothing.

2772
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:17,230
Go to get up,
go to get,

2773
02:08:17,470 --> 02:08:20,920
go.
We'd go off to a cat.

2774
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:22,330
Can I ask you a question?

2775
02:08:22,330 --> 02:08:23,020
Yes,
please do.

2776
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:25,510
What's the,
what's the Hollywood Babylon,

2777
02:08:25,570 --> 02:08:28,900
but over a what happened with Nuñez?
Well,

2778
02:08:28,901 --> 02:08:33,901
she got something called sinus status.
She has apparently like severe sinus 

2779
02:08:35,231 --> 02:08:40,210
infections that affect our balance and 
they get really bad and um,

2780
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:45,300
she got one the day of the weigh ins.
She made it through the weigh ends and 

2781
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:50,041
then she was having like a serious 
episode to the point where they checked 

2782
02:08:50,041 --> 02:08:53,260
her into the hospital and the word was 
that she wanted to compete,

2783
02:08:53,261 --> 02:08:55,180
but her coaches did not want her to 
compete.

2784
02:08:55,181 --> 02:08:55,450
They're,
look,

2785
02:08:55,451 --> 02:08:56,980
look,
you're having like a really hard time,

2786
02:08:56,981 --> 02:09:01,981
like walking,
like apparently when your sciences get 

2787
02:09:01,981 --> 02:09:02,140
like really inflamed,
it fucks with your equilibrium.

2788
02:09:02,190 --> 02:09:02,910
Inner ear.
Yeah.

2789
02:09:03,070 --> 02:09:05,650
This is second and third hand by the 
way.

2790
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:07,230
I didn't talk to her.
Right.

2791
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:08,650
And uh,
you know,

2792
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:11,050
that's what you'd have to do.
You'd have to have her talk about it,

2793
02:09:11,051 --> 02:09:13,610
but it's super unfortunate because that 
was,

2794
02:09:13,820 --> 02:09:18,820
in my opinion,
was the highest level women's mma bout 

2795
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:21,930
ever in terms of the overall ability of 
the two athletes.

2796
02:09:22,570 --> 02:09:25,060
I think Valentina Shevchenko and Amanda 
Nunez,

2797
02:09:25,061 --> 02:09:27,160
they represent the peak.
These are the,

2798
02:09:27,190 --> 02:09:29,020
this is the best we've ever seen.
Yeah.

2799
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:34,260
Nunez is a ruthless knockout striker.
She beat the shit out of Ronda Rousey 

2800
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:34,850
and she choked the shit out of me.
She takes,

2801
02:09:34,860 --> 02:09:37,270
she's a real legit black belt in 
Brazilian Jujitsu,

2802
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:42,300
knockout stryker.
And then volunteership Chanko is a 

2803
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:42,300
Moitai champion.
Ridiculous.

2804
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:43,360
Stand up.
And you know,

2805
02:09:43,420 --> 02:09:45,940
she caught Julianna Pena with an arm bar
from the guard.

2806
02:09:45,941 --> 02:09:50,941
Like her ground game is nasty to me.
Penny is legit for her to catch penny 

2807
02:09:50,941 --> 02:09:53,230
with an arm bars.
That's staggering.

2808
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:56,710
And her striking is so good.
Like you saw in the Holly Holm fight,

2809
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,500
she shot Holly Holm down,
whereas like,

2810
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:02,110
I mean,
Holly Holm fucked up Jermaine to Rhonda,

2811
02:10:02,111 --> 02:10:07,111
me with a question mark.
Kick dropped her with a straight left 

2812
02:10:07,111 --> 02:10:09,721
hand.
She never had close to that kind of 

2813
02:10:09,721 --> 02:10:11,461
success against Valentina.
Valentina is super high level with her 

2814
02:10:11,461 --> 02:10:11,710
striking her movement.

2815
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:16,860
She fights southbound.
She has that beautiful check right hook 

2816
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:18,820
that she throws that like keeps 
everybody minding their p's and q's.

2817
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:24,000
She's at a super well rounded game,
so it's really unfortunate that those 

2818
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:24,910
two didn't go at it,
but that was going to be a good fight.

2819
02:10:24,970 --> 02:10:27,250
I think they're going to schedule it 
again for the.

2820
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:31,360
The event that is after the end of July 
event,

2821
02:10:31,540 --> 02:10:34,810
I think it's 2:15.
They're going to schedule it for sure.

2822
02:10:35,090 --> 02:10:36,560
But then you know,
like Dana White said,

2823
02:10:36,561 --> 02:10:41,360
now Amanda Nunez would never headline in
the van again and I just don't think you

2824
02:10:41,361 --> 02:10:45,620
can force someone to fight if she really
did have a significant injury.

2825
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:49,010
Like they said that the doctors cleared 
her to fight,

2826
02:10:49,550 --> 02:10:51,680
you know,
a significant illness I should say.

2827
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:52,400
She,
she,

2828
02:10:52,401 --> 02:10:56,270
they said the doctors cleared to fight,
but she chose not to the company word,

2829
02:10:56,810 --> 02:10:59,630
but if she's like,
was that fucked up?

2830
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:02,870
I just can't imagine she wasn't that 
fucked up.

2831
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:04,430
I mean,
it's got to suck.

2832
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:09,640
Have you spent millions of dollars 
promoting a fight and then here it is 

2833
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:12,880
and then people bought the paper view 
and then it falls apart and you got to 

2834
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:12,880
give refunds and I don't know.

2835
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:17,670
Yeah.
Well welcome to welcome to the music 

2836
02:11:17,670 --> 02:11:20,881
industry.
When it was at its peak in the nineties 

2837
02:11:20,881 --> 02:11:21,760
when people are like writing big checks 
for stuff and like,

2838
02:11:21,761 --> 02:11:26,761
oh yeah,
this is going to begin to get mariah 

2839
02:11:26,761 --> 02:11:26,761
carey for millions of dollars.
Here's the thing.

2840
02:11:26,761 --> 02:11:29,330
And then she goes and she has a 
meltdown.

2841
02:11:29,331 --> 02:11:30,520
She went crazy peers.
Yeah.

2842
02:11:30,521 --> 02:11:33,460
And then like the like what did we just 
spend our money on?

2843
02:11:33,461 --> 02:11:36,490
What happened just now?
A mariah carey go crazy.

2844
02:11:36,491 --> 02:11:37,180
What happened?
I don't know.

2845
02:11:37,181 --> 02:11:38,950
I think she had a meltdown.
One of those.

2846
02:11:38,980 --> 02:11:40,960
Maybe she got a bad dick.
Wow.

2847
02:11:40,961 --> 02:11:44,830
I wonder if you catch a bad dick while I
have never personally.

2848
02:11:44,831 --> 02:11:46,930
I've never caught a bad dick.
So Dick,

2849
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:49,180
I have.
Not that I'm aware of.

2850
02:11:49,650 --> 02:11:52,330
Big Dick it kitchen ambivalent.
I have not caught him.

2851
02:11:52,331 --> 02:11:55,420
Ambivalent Dick.
Yeah.

2852
02:11:55,810 --> 02:11:57,300
I keep going.
I mean I might.

2853
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:58,990
There might be one in there somewhere.
I wonder.

2854
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:00,490
I wonder,
I mean,

2855
02:12:00,491 --> 02:12:01,770
it's got,
it's got to be a way.

2856
02:12:02,890 --> 02:12:03,490
Yeah.
I don't know,

2857
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,350
but you know,
somebody wrote a big check.

2858
02:12:05,620 --> 02:12:10,620
You have an artist who had a meltdown,
didn't deliver because that's you're 

2859
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:12,610
talking about were we are merchants of 
emotion.

2860
02:12:12,611 --> 02:12:15,820
That's what we do.
And sometimes it can overwhelm you.

2861
02:12:15,821 --> 02:12:18,190
That is an old,
that is a volatile thing.

2862
02:12:18,660 --> 02:12:23,660
Um,
and it's story as old as time and you 

2863
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:23,660
know,
with fighters,

2864
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:26,380
one little dump thick walking up the 
stairs to the octagon,

2865
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:30,610
he can pull know your acl fucking 
separates from your body.

2866
02:12:30,611 --> 02:12:31,840
Yeah.
You could slip you.

2867
02:12:31,841 --> 02:12:36,841
Kevin Randleman was backstage preparing 
for a fight once and he stepped on a 

2868
02:12:36,841 --> 02:12:37,750
pipe and slipped and fell on his head 
and was concussed.

2869
02:12:39,190 --> 02:12:40,270
Yeah,
right

2870
02:12:40,310 --> 02:12:42,500
before the main event,
right before the main event,

2871
02:12:42,501 --> 02:12:44,540
he was walking backstage.
He stepped on something,

2872
02:12:44,541 --> 02:12:46,410
slipped his leg,
went up on,

2873
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:49,820
he hit his fucking head and he was 
concussed and they canceled the fight.

2874
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:53,150
Yeah.
That was like a myth.

2875
02:12:53,210 --> 02:12:58,210
I want to say that was in 1997 or 1998 
or somewhere around there and it just 

2876
02:12:58,210 --> 02:12:58,700
like,
what?

2877
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:01,430
Yeah,
that can happen for sure.

2878
02:13:01,580 --> 02:13:06,580
And then for a fighter,
there's so much about who they are is 

2879
02:13:06,580 --> 02:13:11,560
dependent upon their confidence and 
their state of mind and if she hears 

2880
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:15,611
that the UFC is pissed at her,
she had to pull out of the fight and 

2881
02:13:15,611 --> 02:13:16,830
then they say that they'll never have 
her headline and event again.

2882
02:13:16,831 --> 02:13:21,831
I when she goes from being this 
superstar with two spectacular 

2883
02:13:21,831 --> 02:13:23,510
performances against the most popular 
women's fighters of all time,

2884
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:26,540
those two,
between Misha tate and Ronda Rousey,

2885
02:13:26,541 --> 02:13:29,510
I would say arguably the most popular 
women fighters of all time.

2886
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:32,070
Coincidentally,
they're both the hottest.

2887
02:13:32,430 --> 02:13:34,130
How weird.
You know,

2888
02:13:34,650 --> 02:13:36,220
like you got to see if you're going to 
be a chicken,

2889
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:37,230
you got to be a fighter.
It's,

2890
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:40,650
it helps a lot if you're hot,
doesn't it?

2891
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:45,000
I am not hot and I'm not a chip.
I noticed both of those things.

2892
02:13:45,210 --> 02:13:48,800
I didn't want to bring it up though.
I didn't want to rub your face in it.

2893
02:13:48,990 --> 02:13:49,770
Right.
But uh,

2894
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:50,790
yeah,
I mean she's.

2895
02:13:50,820 --> 02:13:52,290
Who knows how she's going to bounce back
from.

2896
02:13:52,291 --> 02:13:54,180
That sucks.
It sucks with Valentine at too,

2897
02:13:54,181 --> 02:13:55,530
right?
She gets through the weigh ins,

2898
02:13:55,830 --> 02:13:58,810
she gets through the weight cut,
she gets to the training at home.

2899
02:13:59,220 --> 02:14:02,400
Home is one on a in Singapore.
That was a wonderful.

2900
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:03,690
That was great.
Balm.

2901
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:08,840
Yeah.
She that question mark kick that same 

2902
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:08,840
kick she throws.
That kicks so well.

2903
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:10,710
That's a sneaky ass fucking kick man.

2904
02:14:10,710 --> 02:14:15,710
When you think it's going to be a round 
kick to the body or a low kick and then 

2905
02:14:15,710 --> 02:14:16,350
it comes up high and clangs you in the 
dome.

2906
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:18,810
Yeah.
It's so good the way they throw that too

2907
02:14:18,811 --> 02:14:23,040
because it comes in like this and that 
loops over clang.

2908
02:14:23,370 --> 02:14:25,740
She might be the best in the world at it
in an MMA.

2909
02:14:26,130 --> 02:14:27,910
Luke rockhold is got a really good one 
too.

2910
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:29,910
He used it against bisping and their 
first fight.

2911
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:35,160
They.
They throw it and it's such an unusual 

2912
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:36,630
motion of a kick.
It looks like it's coming up and then it

2913
02:14:36,631 --> 02:14:39,300
just goes whip over the top,
pull up.

2914
02:14:39,330 --> 02:14:42,030
Luke rockhold Kaos.
Michael Bisping.

2915
02:14:42,330 --> 02:14:47,330
He actually dropped him with it and then
he caught him with a guillotine choke 

2916
02:14:47,330 --> 02:14:47,880
afterwards and tapped him with a gay 
teen,

2917
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:52,050
but the way he throws that kick his 
fucking super sneaky.

2918
02:14:52,110 --> 02:14:53,210
Who's coming up?
There's some.

2919
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:55,800
There's a Maya fight coming up in there.
Yeah.

2920
02:14:57,040 --> 02:15:00,600
I'm UFC 199.
Is this the right one?

2921
02:15:00,930 --> 02:15:04,650
Is this the one when he won or is this 
the one?

2922
02:15:05,460 --> 02:15:08,660
I'm not sure.
This is the one where bisping Kaos him.

2923
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:10,090
Yeah.
See right there.

2924
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:13,110
Yeah,
go to the first one.

2925
02:15:13,140 --> 02:15:15,660
Their first fight.
Their first fight is the one.

2926
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:17,670
He choked him out.
He didn't kill him,

2927
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:21,840
but he a clang them with the question 
mark kick.

2928
02:15:22,410 --> 02:15:23,700
Yeah.
Don't go with Kao

2929
02:15:25,590 --> 02:15:28,040
versus Bisping One.
Yeah,

2930
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:29,580
Guillotine.
Here it is.

2931
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:34,260
You got jacked?
Yeah.

2932
02:15:34,261 --> 02:15:36,270
This is some guy holding up a camera.
I did it,

2933
02:15:36,271 --> 02:15:41,271
man.
The UFC takes a lot of those things 

2934
02:15:41,271 --> 02:15:42,630
down.
I think rockhold guillotine choke.

2935
02:15:42,631 --> 02:15:44,040
First Time bisping taps.
Yeah.

2936
02:15:44,041 --> 02:15:49,041
This is it.
Because he was wearing a beard at the 

2937
02:15:49,041 --> 02:15:49,041
time.
Interesting.

2938
02:15:49,041 --> 02:15:49,800
They fought two times,
you know,

2939
02:15:50,910 --> 02:15:53,070
and then rockhold thought it was going 
to be an easy fight.

2940
02:15:53,071 --> 02:15:55,650
The second time and he got fucked up.

2941
02:15:58,330 --> 02:16:01,990
I think it's right before that.
I don't know.

2942
02:16:01,991 --> 02:16:05,360
It's hard to tell.
But anyway,

2943
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:09,310
so it's such an unusual movement.
What is this?

2944
02:16:09,311 --> 02:16:11,290
Just a bunch of highlights.
There it is right there.

2945
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:15,790
But they don't show the whole kick.
They just show that the actual end of it

2946
02:16:15,791 --> 02:16:16,960
as it's landing,
Eh,

2947
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:19,330
whatever.
You have to show it.

2948
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:22,570
Point being holly has got one of the 
best.

2949
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:27,660
She's.
She's interesting because she's a 

2950
02:16:27,660 --> 02:16:28,510
combination of a boxer.
She was like a world champion boxer.

2951
02:16:28,511 --> 02:16:33,040
I think like times world champion boxer,
but she also has like traditional karate

2952
02:16:33,041 --> 02:16:38,041
techniques.
It's throws like a lot of side kicks in 

2953
02:16:38,041 --> 02:16:38,041
like these weird round kicks.
Yeah.

2954
02:16:38,041 --> 02:16:40,720
She keep eyes when she throws shots.
Yeah,

2955
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:42,640
there it is.
Cut Climbing.

2956
02:16:43,270 --> 02:16:45,220
Yeah.
And that was after bench go.

2957
02:16:45,221 --> 02:16:47,690
Hey,
I was kind of like taunting her.

2958
02:16:48,610 --> 02:16:49,630
Oopsies.
Yeah.

2959
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:51,790
That high kick man,
that left high kick.

2960
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:55,290
That's her highlight reel movement.
That's the one that separated Rousey.

2961
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:56,590
You can eat crap

2962
02:16:56,620 --> 02:16:58,510
for our uh,
our um,

2963
02:16:58,511 --> 02:17:02,860
arsonist video for me and my me fighting
Ronda Rousey.

2964
02:17:02,890 --> 02:17:04,270
No,
no good.

2965
02:17:04,450 --> 02:17:06,400
No good.
No one gave me a hard time,

2966
02:17:06,900 --> 02:17:06,990
know

2967
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:10,100
no holly or any of these guys and they 
were,

2968
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:12,650
you know,
they were the fantastic five and there I

2969
02:17:12,651 --> 02:17:16,430
wasn't sure like might come out like you
do realize I'm a trump supporter.

2970
02:17:16,431 --> 02:17:17,120
Like,
Oh crap.

2971
02:17:17,290 --> 02:17:19,000
No.
Everybody thought it was funny.

2972
02:17:19,290 --> 02:17:21,220
It looked it didn't.
You got the,

2973
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:26,250
you got away with that one maybe,
but maybe now that we're talking about 

2974
02:17:26,250 --> 02:17:30,450
people are going to review it because 
the standards over the last two months 

2975
02:17:30,450 --> 02:17:32,050
has probably changed and people decided 
more things are offensive now that we're

2976
02:17:32,051 --> 02:17:33,040
then yeah,
hurry up,

2977
02:17:33,041 --> 02:17:34,760
get on that because uh,
you know,

2978
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:40,710
yell at me about that.
People are super uptight about what is 

2979
02:17:40,710 --> 02:17:41,710
offensive and what isn't offensive.
And it moves.

2980
02:17:41,950 --> 02:17:43,960
It moves like the tide.
It comes in,

2981
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:45,670
it comes out.
There it is.

2982
02:17:46,030 --> 02:17:47,020
Hey,
you can play it.

2983
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:49,000
I'm going to play the whole thing.
How long,

2984
02:17:49,001 --> 02:17:52,480
how many minutes?
Is it time spent training for minutes?

2985
02:17:52,510 --> 02:17:55,600
I don't know.
The vertical hole victorious.

2986
02:17:55,601 --> 02:18:00,340
And with my junk intacct people,
we know how good Rhonda is.

2987
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:02,740
This could be epic

2988
02:18:03,850 --> 02:18:08,850
Joe Rogan.
Not to be confused with

2989
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:14,480
conor Mcgregor.
You gave Rhonda Rousey a very manly 

2990
02:18:14,480 --> 02:18:14,480
appearance.

2991
02:18:14,480 --> 02:18:18,380
Nothing at the store.
What's going on here?

2992
02:18:20,110 --> 02:18:20,800
Having a lunch

2993
02:18:22,590 --> 02:18:27,590
specific diet for people at home were 
watching animation.

2994
02:18:34,231 --> 02:18:39,231
If you're just listening,
Rhonda is hitting the speed bag right 

2995
02:18:39,231 --> 02:18:39,360
now.
Looking very angry.

2996
02:18:41,950 --> 02:18:46,950
Commanders taking steroids and maynard 
shooting stairs and it was a bad ass 

2997
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:47,700
because I don't.
I don't want to lose my job.

2998
02:18:48,420 --> 02:18:52,540
I like how you have tents.
Why'd you decide to have Ted's?

2999
02:18:55,210 --> 02:18:57,480
Oh,
you got a problem with that?

3000
02:18:57,800 --> 02:18:58,360
No,
I don't.

3001
02:18:58,370 --> 02:19:02,820
Just on men.
I feel like it's a gender appropriation.

3002
02:19:03,690 --> 02:19:04,940
It might be.
It is.

3003
02:19:04,941 --> 02:19:07,680
So man with tits,
if you don't claim transgender,

3004
02:19:07,830 --> 02:19:11,870
I got yelled at like what do you have 
against people that are transgender?

3005
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:14,610
Like you know you're giving up your 
junk.

3006
02:19:14,640 --> 02:19:16,560
If you lose to Rhonda,
like that's a bad thing.

3007
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:20,490
It's okay in a bag.
Here's how it works.

3008
02:19:21,430 --> 02:19:24,280
You have something that you want to hang
onto and keep.

3009
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:29,360
Right?
I have something I want to hang onto a 

3010
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:29,360
keep,
whether it's money or whatever,

3011
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:29,360
and the bet is

3012
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:33,250
that if you lose,
you have to give up the thing that you 

3013
02:19:33,250 --> 02:19:33,250
want to keep.
You don't.

3014
02:19:33,250 --> 02:19:36,710
You don't lose a bet and then give up 
something you were willing to get rid of

3015
02:19:36,711 --> 02:19:37,940
anyway.
Of course.

3016
02:19:38,420 --> 02:19:40,610
So if you're a person who doesn't want 
your junk,

3017
02:19:41,250 --> 02:19:43,760
just that's the choice you've made,
then don't.

3018
02:19:44,270 --> 02:19:45,860
That's not really a bet,
but if you.

3019
02:19:46,420 --> 02:19:51,420
If you're a person who wants to hang 
onto your junk and you bet your junk 

3020
02:19:51,420 --> 02:19:51,950
away,
that's I want my junk.

3021
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:53,480
Nope,
no disrespect to Mary.

3022
02:19:53,481 --> 02:19:55,820
Who does not want their junk?
You want to give away?

3023
02:19:55,821 --> 02:19:57,230
If you want to cut your shit off,
that's fine.

3024
02:19:57,290 --> 02:19:58,640
I don't care,
but I want.

3025
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:01,910
I would like to keep my job.
That's what my wife,

3026
02:20:01,950 --> 02:20:06,950
my wife wants me to keep my junk.
I think that's a really reasonable 

3027
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:06,950
request.

3028
02:20:07,250 --> 02:20:12,250
And this,
in this video you made Donald Trump to 

3029
02:20:12,250 --> 02:20:13,100
be a giant monster that must be put down
trump's Zilla.

3030
02:20:13,220 --> 02:20:15,440
Now,
do you worry that like the,

3031
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:17,630
what they call now,
the Kathy Griffin effect?

3032
02:20:17,631 --> 02:20:19,910
Could possibly happen.
People get ahold of this video.

3033
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:22,960
I think that you were.
My career was over a long time.

3034
02:20:23,570 --> 02:20:26,420
I don't think her career is over.
I just think it's shifted.

3035
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:29,030
It's shifted.
It's moved to a different place.

3036
02:20:29,650 --> 02:20:32,930
While she's universally hated by the 
right.

3037
02:20:33,770 --> 02:20:35,030
She wasn't before she,
you know,

3038
02:20:35,060 --> 02:20:38,780
she was just kind of Kathy Griffin.
Now she's like enemy of the state.

3039
02:20:40,430 --> 02:20:42,590
It's just her trying to be relevant and 
it didn't work.

3040
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:44,390
Yeah,
exactly right.

3041
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:46,290
That's exactly what it was.
Who is this one with?

3042
02:20:46,291 --> 02:20:50,420
The Demon said it was supposed to be 
Misha tape,

3043
02:20:50,421 --> 02:20:52,010
but I was trying to be kind.
Oh,

3044
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:57,200
so you turn turned into a demon instead 
because she came out and supported 

3045
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:57,200
trump.

3046
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:58,460
So I was gonna I was gonna throw under 
the bus.

3047
02:20:58,461 --> 02:20:59,910
Yeah.
She made some statements earlier,

3048
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:02,340
like around that time.
Really.

3049
02:21:02,370 --> 02:21:03,740
But I was like,
you know what?

3050
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:05,810
I'm not.
She might have meant something else.

3051
02:21:05,811 --> 02:21:09,470
So I made them because it used to have 
her name under her.

3052
02:21:09,471 --> 02:21:14,471
There was her know as the trump minyan.
I like how the hair is all crazy.

3053
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:18,990
You get underneath the hair.
It's like scalp.

3054
02:21:18,991 --> 02:21:23,991
But comes over the top and crushes you 
from two bald guys.

3055
02:21:28,250 --> 02:21:31,670
Don't you want to just talk to them 
about that hair and go,

3056
02:21:31,671 --> 02:21:36,671
dude,
you are wasting so much time and effort 

3057
02:21:36,671 --> 02:21:36,980
on that disaster you're keeping on top 
of your head.

3058
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:37,670
But it doesn't.

3059
02:21:37,930 --> 02:21:40,660
Again,
it might be just a part of the part of a

3060
02:21:40,661 --> 02:21:43,480
thing like it just keep that going.
Like the don king thing.

3061
02:21:44,110 --> 02:21:49,110
Like it's all part of like he's got to 
know people have better haircuts than 

3062
02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:49,110
him.
Right?

3063
02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:49,990
Yeah.
But he doesn't care,

3064
02:21:50,090 --> 02:21:53,020
right.
Maybe part of the whole you're to do it.

3065
02:21:53,050 --> 02:21:55,810
Do it.
Like make it look like a hat for.

3066
02:21:55,811 --> 02:21:56,880
We'll have.
Yeah.

3067
02:21:56,890 --> 02:22:01,890
It's part of the whole.
Patrick's spraying everything down and 

3068
02:22:01,890 --> 02:22:02,350
locking it in place.
Oh you.

3069
02:22:02,430 --> 02:22:04,930
She got your balls in a jar that's very 
triggering.

3070
02:22:05,530 --> 02:22:07,840
That triggers you trot was problematic.

3071
02:22:11,630 --> 02:22:16,630
You got to be careful these days.
Men can have balls in a jar and make it 

3072
02:22:16,630 --> 02:22:20,631
seem like it's a bad thing.
If someone identifies with the type of 

3073
02:22:20,631 --> 02:22:21,300
person that wants to have their balls in
a jar.

3074
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:23,400
How do you feel about Trans Racial 
people?

3075
02:22:23,770 --> 02:22:26,420
Meteor.
We need all of you.

3076
02:22:26,910 --> 02:22:29,550
I need a meter for all of you.
Everybody.

3077
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:31,980
Where does it hit?
If you,

3078
02:22:31,981 --> 02:22:32,380
uh,
if.

3079
02:22:32,450 --> 02:22:34,440
Okay,
let's say if you're God,

3080
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:35,150
you're making.
You're gonna.

3081
02:22:35,170 --> 02:22:36,540
Make me say where it's going to hit it 
at.

3082
02:22:36,541 --> 02:22:37,730
Where's it go?
Where's it go?

3083
02:22:37,731 --> 02:22:39,640
That does the most.
Uh,

3084
02:22:39,900 --> 02:22:41,080
how big is it?
Huge.

3085
02:22:41,360 --> 02:22:43,620
Five miles.
Five miles along with kill everybody.

3086
02:22:43,650 --> 02:22:48,650
That's what killed the dinosaurs.
We need like a football field sized 

3087
02:22:48,650 --> 02:22:51,810
media,
like a hundred north 100 yards north.

3088
02:22:51,811 --> 02:22:56,130
Paul's not good enough.
Paul's going to cause affects around all

3089
02:22:56,131 --> 02:22:58,290
of their shores below it.
Interesting.

3090
02:22:58,320 --> 02:22:59,160
Let's look at the world.

3091
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:01,220
Where do we hit it?
I'm looking at China,

3092
02:23:01,230 --> 02:23:03,510
Bro.
I feel like they can take the hit.

3093
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:07,230
I feel like they need a solution anyway.
They've got a real problem.

3094
02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:12,260
There's a billion people over there.
So you're saying it has to be a 

3095
02:23:12,260 --> 02:23:12,780
populated area?
Yeah,

3096
02:23:12,810 --> 02:23:14,370
but maybe like weird.
Like maybe you,

3097
02:23:14,371 --> 02:23:15,930
Lynne,
like right where they eat the dogs.

3098
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:20,340
Maybe we go to the dog festival just and
then like everybody goes,

3099
02:23:20,341 --> 02:23:21,750
hey man,
maybe you shouldn't eat dogs.

3100
02:23:21,780 --> 02:23:26,130
God decided to hurl a media and all 
those assholes that are killing people's

3101
02:23:26,131 --> 02:23:27,090
pets.
They're killing.

3102
02:23:27,940 --> 02:23:32,940
What if it's five slightly smaller 
meteors and they hit every like most 

3103
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:33,840
continents.
That's not a bad idea,

3104
02:23:33,841 --> 02:23:36,490
but I think we need one big one and I 
think that you.

3105
02:23:36,491 --> 02:23:41,491
Lynn takes the hit.
I was watching these videos where they 

3106
02:23:41,491 --> 02:23:44,540
were capturing dogs,
stealing people's pets and they're 

3107
02:23:44,540 --> 02:23:44,540
cooking them.

3108
02:23:44,540 --> 02:23:46,350
Suck.
Boy meet.

3109
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:47,160
Yeah,
let's go near there.

3110
02:23:47,190 --> 02:23:48,510
Let's just put it there.
That's the spot.

3111
02:23:48,540 --> 02:23:51,810
That's just put it where they make the 
dog meat like Grad as they're cooking up

3112
02:23:51,811 --> 02:23:55,480
the dog eat dog.
She's picking,

3113
02:23:55,510 --> 02:23:57,320
which I probably should go pick the hot 
dog man.

3114
02:23:58,530 --> 02:23:59,700
What's up?
I gotta get my.

3115
02:23:59,970 --> 02:24:02,040
Took my dog to the groomer.
Did you really?

3116
02:24:02,060 --> 02:24:04,050
Oh yeah.
You took your dog out here.

3117
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:06,450
Did you drive or do you fly?
I fly.

3118
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:11,480
I flew.
Do you put your dog in the bottom with 

3119
02:24:11,480 --> 02:24:11,970
the regular dogs?
She's,

3120
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,280
she's with me.
So she sits with you?

3121
02:24:14,420 --> 02:24:19,420
Yeah.
Now do you have to make sure that the 

3122
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:19,420
person next to you is in gravely?
Uh,

3123
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:22,430
allergic to dogs who have to make sure 
you fuck them,

3124
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:24,720
fuck them,
but you have to tell the airline,

3125
02:24:24,721 --> 02:24:29,721
hey,
I'm traveling with my emotional support 

3126
02:24:29,721 --> 02:24:29,721
dog because I'm very fragile.

3127
02:24:29,721 --> 02:24:31,470
I'm traveling with my emotional support 
dog because in theory,

3128
02:24:31,471 --> 02:24:34,140
perhaps this might have happened to 
someone that we might know.

3129
02:24:34,690 --> 02:24:36,680
You're getting on an airline and they 
look at your.

3130
02:24:36,830 --> 02:24:38,940
You're paying for a dog to go on the 
flight,

3131
02:24:39,540 --> 02:24:44,540
right?
I'm paying extra for the dog to go on 

3132
02:24:44,540 --> 02:24:44,540
the flight.
Sir.

3133
02:24:44,540 --> 02:24:46,860
Does your dogs thing fit under the seat 
in front of you?

3134
02:24:46,870 --> 02:24:47,610
Is it fit?
Yes,

3135
02:24:47,611 --> 02:24:52,611
it's,
it's regulation is what you want under 

3136
02:24:52,611 --> 02:24:52,611
the seat in front of you.
Great.

3137
02:24:52,611 --> 02:24:55,020
Ooh,
your other bag is too big,

3138
02:24:55,650 --> 02:24:57,750
but that's my,
that's my carry on bag.

3139
02:24:59,010 --> 02:25:01,200
Yeah.
But now that you're bringing a dog on,

3140
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:06,270
that is your carry on bag and that bag 
you have doesn't fit under the seat in 

3141
02:25:06,270 --> 02:25:08,040
front of you,
which is where my dog is going to be.

3142
02:25:08,390 --> 02:25:10,350
Right.
So what do you do?

3143
02:25:10,410 --> 02:25:12,540
So you had the choice.
I had to check the bag.

3144
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:15,420
So you checked the bag and the dog stays
under the seat,

3145
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:18,570
but the dog doesn't really fit under the
seat.

3146
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:20,670
Yeah,
she's 11 pounds.

3147
02:25:21,210 --> 02:25:26,210
She's small,
but he kinda like stuffer into that 

3148
02:25:26,210 --> 02:25:28,110
crack where the laptop bag goes.
Really small dogs in Yorkie.

3149
02:25:28,510 --> 02:25:29,200
Oh,
okay.

3150
02:25:29,830 --> 02:25:32,560
Yeah.
So the point is that if I had,

3151
02:25:32,810 --> 02:25:37,810
if I had a personal item that goes in,
if that goes under the seat in front of 

3152
02:25:37,810 --> 02:25:41,251
me and the rolling bag goes up in that 
upper space that you have paid for,

3153
02:25:42,110 --> 02:25:43,290
right?
Uh,

3154
02:25:44,230 --> 02:25:45,280
but they're telling me like,
no,

3155
02:25:45,281 --> 02:25:48,970
the dog is now the,
the carry on bag,

3156
02:25:49,180 --> 02:25:54,180
but I'm not.
So you want me to put my dog in the 

3157
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:54,180
overhead bin?
No,

3158
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:54,180
it has to go into the seat in front of 
you.

3159
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:56,380
But you told me that carry on bags go in
the overhead bin.

3160
02:25:56,650 --> 02:26:00,520
It's all just like red tape.
Catch 22 crap.

3161
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:05,680
But as your dog have an Esa,
is it an emotional support animal?

3162
02:26:06,490 --> 02:26:09,280
It can be.
Does it have to be?

3163
02:26:09,490 --> 02:26:10,330
Yeah.
Because if you had that,

3164
02:26:10,331 --> 02:26:15,331
then we don't charge you anything and 
you can actually bring on all three of 

3165
02:26:15,331 --> 02:26:16,900
those items,
dog your carry on and your personal life

3166
02:26:16,901 --> 02:26:20,560
and bring three bags on if your dogs and
emotional support animal.

3167
02:26:20,650 --> 02:26:22,780
So if you're not.
So luckily for me,

3168
02:26:22,900 --> 02:26:26,710
I can't fly without my dog.
Oh,

3169
02:26:26,711 --> 02:26:27,760
okay.
I get it.

3170
02:26:28,630 --> 02:26:29,050
I get it.

3171
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:31,940
I think Natasha has that deal to Natasha
Leggiero.

3172
02:26:31,970 --> 02:26:34,190
She was an emotional support dog.
Yeah,

3173
02:26:34,430 --> 02:26:39,430
that's a.
that's a gross loophole and I applaud 

3174
02:26:39,430 --> 02:26:39,890
you for capitalizing on it.
So way to go.

3175
02:26:41,210 --> 02:26:42,770
Unless you're sitting next to someone 
who's like,

3176
02:26:43,470 --> 02:26:45,050
I need a moment.
I need a moment.

3177
02:26:45,110 --> 02:26:45,470
Yeah,
man.

3178
02:26:45,471 --> 02:26:50,471
Get your collector motions.
The dogs aren't even here to support 

3179
02:26:50,471 --> 02:26:50,780
you.
How do you get through it?

3180
02:26:52,710 --> 02:26:53,670
I,
I,

3181
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:58,760
I,
I pretend that the American Werewolf in 

3182
02:26:58,760 --> 02:26:59,560
London with my dog.
That's a good move.

3183
02:27:00,180 --> 02:27:01,210
Good move.
Yeah.

3184
02:27:01,390 --> 02:27:03,730
I feel like a dog by proxy.
Yeah.

3185
02:27:04,590 --> 02:27:05,040
Yeah.
It's weird.

3186
02:27:05,070 --> 02:27:07,170
Isn't a weird thing that,
that was never around.

3187
02:27:07,171 --> 02:27:08,910
We were a kid.
That's why I had to pull this out.

3188
02:27:08,970 --> 02:27:11,370
Emotional support because you're fucking
weak.

3189
02:27:11,770 --> 02:27:16,710
Your mind is weak and you're fucked.
You're fucked.

3190
02:27:17,370 --> 02:27:22,370
You can't even go to the fucking 
starbucks without bringing your dog in 

3191
02:27:22,370 --> 02:27:24,300
with you.
I think you're allowed to do that.

3192
02:27:24,301 --> 02:27:24,720
I mean,
that's.

3193
02:27:24,721 --> 02:27:26,850
I think that's part of it.
Like if you had the paperwork,

3194
02:27:26,851 --> 02:27:30,540
you can go in to play anywhere that 
you're not supposed to have it.

3195
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:35,600
There's a restaurant that I go to that 
one of those ladies used to be hot back 

3196
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:37,590
in the day and that she used to be on 
that desperate housewives show.

3197
02:27:38,050 --> 02:27:43,050
Now she's kind of getting up there in 
the years and getting a little wackier 

3198
02:27:43,050 --> 02:27:43,350
and wacky.
I'm sure as time goes on,

3199
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:46,020
she brings in a full grown golden lab.

3200
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:51,560
This silly bitch.
His dog is like sitting down where 

3201
02:27:51,560 --> 02:27:54,870
everybody's forks codes,
dirty assholes touching the ground where

3202
02:27:54,871 --> 02:27:57,870
people accidentally dropped their spoon.
It's just.

3203
02:27:57,930 --> 02:28:00,120
It's such a big dog.
It's so gross.

3204
02:28:00,310 --> 02:28:03,180
It was like something about a little dog
sitting in someone's lap at a restaurant

3205
02:28:03,181 --> 02:28:05,370
that's like,
it seems stupid,

3206
02:28:05,371 --> 02:28:10,371
but maybe not so bad,
but a lab fucking 70 pound big ass dog 

3207
02:28:11,701 --> 02:28:16,701
laying on the ground and it's crazy.
Bitch is putting everybody else imposing

3208
02:28:17,131 --> 02:28:20,620
her situation on everybody else.
She knows it's not.

3209
02:28:20,621 --> 02:28:24,980
So do you that people that go down that,
and I think actors do this,

3210
02:28:25,220 --> 02:28:30,220
that go down that hardcore ketogenic 
diet that they cut all the carbs out of 

3211
02:28:30,651 --> 02:28:32,350
their diet sugars.
Do you think it's starts to,

3212
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:35,510
if they do it long enough to start to 
get a little dinky,

3213
02:28:36,180 --> 02:28:38,090
it could happen.
Definitely.

3214
02:28:38,091 --> 02:28:43,091
Um,
you get the Keto flu when you first 

3215
02:28:43,091 --> 02:28:43,091
started out.

3216
02:28:43,091 --> 02:28:43,460
I definitely got that can push people 
over the top,

3217
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:48,760
but you got to do it smart.
Can't work out too hard when you first 

3218
02:28:48,760 --> 02:28:49,850
start doing it and you got to take 
exogenous ketones.

3219
02:28:49,851 --> 02:28:51,200
That's a big,
big.

3220
02:28:51,230 --> 02:28:52,960
That's helped me a tremendous amount.
What it,

3221
02:28:53,980 --> 02:28:57,080
what the fuck did he just say,
exoneration as ketones?

3222
02:28:57,140 --> 02:28:59,180
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's a bunch of different companies.

3223
02:28:59,720 --> 02:29:04,720
The one I use is called key genics.
They have a new one called eugenics 

3224
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:04,720
prime.
It's apparently even better,

3225
02:29:04,970 --> 02:29:06,080
but what it is is,
uh,

3226
02:29:06,170 --> 02:29:07,160
it's,
it's,

3227
02:29:07,161 --> 02:29:12,161
um,
Kama Sutra to bunch of amino acids and 

3228
02:29:12,161 --> 02:29:13,910
minerals and stuff that puts your body 
into a state of ketosis.

3229
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:15,290
And it,
uh,

3230
02:29:15,320 --> 02:29:18,260
it allows you to balance out,
it's like,

3231
02:29:18,261 --> 02:29:23,261
it's very good to balance out,
gives you energy when you're sort of 

3232
02:29:23,261 --> 02:29:26,951
struggling through that Keto flu thing 
and then eventually body adapts body 

3233
02:29:26,951 --> 02:29:31,421
gets used to burning fat and then it 
just seems like it has more energy when 

3234
02:29:31,421 --> 02:29:31,421
you do that.

3235
02:29:31,421 --> 02:29:36,190
But to really truly be effective,
don't you hit that kind of work out two 

3236
02:29:36,190 --> 02:29:36,860
hours a day to really make it?
No,

3237
02:29:37,130 --> 02:29:38,000
no,
no.

3238
02:29:38,001 --> 02:29:40,250
You could definitely make it flip 
without working out that much.

3239
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:42,110
You don't have to work it out that much.
You just,

3240
02:29:42,111 --> 02:29:43,460
your body has to realize like,
okay,

3241
02:29:43,461 --> 02:29:45,860
carbs aren't coming in.
We're going to need to burn fats,

3242
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:51,100
which it has as a sort of a go to way 
like we've been eating fats and people 

3243
02:29:52,161 --> 02:29:54,970
have been relying on fats forever.
It's not a negative thing.

3244
02:29:54,980 --> 02:29:57,380
Like people have this idea that the 
brain relies only on.

3245
02:29:57,470 --> 02:30:02,470
You have any kind of carbs at all.
You had to get past a certain amount of 

3246
02:30:02,470 --> 02:30:02,990
time or like these are people have just 
given that up forever.

3247
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:04,550
No,
you can have some carbs.

3248
02:30:04,610 --> 02:30:08,060
Your body has a certain amount of 
flexibility to it,

3249
02:30:08,061 --> 02:30:13,061
but the way they've done it well,
here's a perfect example of how much 

3250
02:30:13,061 --> 02:30:17,051
biodiversity or this when it comes to 
your body's ability to absorb 

3251
02:30:17,051 --> 02:30:17,330
carbohydrates and how it reacts.

3252
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:22,700
I'm Rob Wolf who was a a,
a a scientist and a big paleo researcher

3253
02:30:22,701 --> 02:30:27,701
guy.
He's got an interesting instagram page 

3254
02:30:27,701 --> 02:30:27,701
and on his,
I think it's Das.

3255
02:30:27,701 --> 02:30:31,850
Robb wolf is instagram,
but what he does is he'll eat something 

3256
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:36,050
and they'll have his wife eat something 
and then they'll do these tests,

3257
02:30:37,250 --> 02:30:42,250
blood tests to find out where their 
ketones are and whether or not they're 

3258
02:30:42,250 --> 02:30:46,181
in a ketogenic state and his body's way 
more fragile in terms of like it's 

3259
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:48,890
getting knocked off a ketosis.
Then his wife's body,

3260
02:30:49,420 --> 02:30:50,990
his wife just rebounds.
Better choices,

3261
02:30:50,991 --> 02:30:53,290
better genetics for it.
So it's pretty cool.

3262
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:55,040
You know,
they obviously lived together eating the

3263
02:30:55,041 --> 02:30:56,500
same foods,
so it's,

3264
02:30:56,870 --> 02:31:01,870
there's a lot of variables involved in 
how your body processes carbs and it 

3265
02:31:01,870 --> 02:31:02,480
could,
you know,

3266
02:31:02,481 --> 02:31:05,870
it's like some people have celiacs,
some people are gluten sensitive,

3267
02:31:05,871 --> 02:31:06,920
some people,
you know,

3268
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:12,160
some people have no problem eating a big
bowl of rice and they stay in Ketosis 

3269
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:16,360
and with some people that just knocks 
them right out of it and the body goes 

3270
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:19,271
right back to burning carbs.
It depends also on how strict you've 

3271
02:31:19,271 --> 02:31:20,010
been in the Ketogenic Diet and how long 
you've done

3272
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:25,010
it for free,
but there's a lot of critics of that 

3273
02:31:25,010 --> 02:31:26,871
diet too.
There's a lot of people that cry 

3274
02:31:26,871 --> 02:31:26,871
bullshit on that.
I don't know if they're crying.

3275
02:31:26,871 --> 02:31:28,230
I think some of the people that cry 
bullshit though,

3276
02:31:28,231 --> 02:31:30,680
they don't really have much of a science
background and they're just.

3277
02:31:30,750 --> 02:31:35,750
They're just.
There also been a certain way I can buy 

3278
02:31:35,750 --> 02:31:38,930
three things.
I tried to stick as close as I could to 

3279
02:31:38,930 --> 02:31:41,511
the ketogenic diet,
but it probably wasn't a ketogenic diet 

3280
02:31:41,511 --> 02:31:41,880
was just basically making sure that I 
wasn't eating any sugar,

3281
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:45,330
any fruit,
any carbs that I know that I know of.

3282
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:51,440
I was eating within a 10 hour window,
so if I got up at 10:00

3283
02:31:52,020 --> 02:31:57,020
AM and I had anything to eat,
I didn't eat anything after eight and I 

3284
02:31:57,020 --> 02:31:58,350
was trying to work out,
you know,

3285
02:31:58,351 --> 02:32:00,810
do something for an hour a day.
That's a,

3286
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:03,260
well,
that's a great combination of mostly key

3287
02:32:03,261 --> 02:32:06,140
to genic or ketogenic and this,
um,

3288
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:11,960
the fasting,
what you're doing is intermittent 

3289
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:13,140
fasting by going 14 hours every day 
without eating.

3290
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:16,380
That apparently is a really good 
protocol for losing weight.

3291
02:32:16,381 --> 02:32:17,760
And I've done it.
I like it.

3292
02:32:18,150 --> 02:32:20,970
I think it makes me feel good to me.
Puts your body in a good place.

3293
02:32:20,971 --> 02:32:25,680
Your body gets accustomed to only eating
for eight hours a day and then the other

3294
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:29,100
hours you just don't eat just normal 
six,

3295
02:32:29,310 --> 02:32:31,110
16 hours.
You just know eating.

3296
02:32:32,420 --> 02:32:35,010
That's a tough one for most people it 
is.

3297
02:32:35,011 --> 02:32:36,270
But especially on the road,
I'm like,

3298
02:32:36,271 --> 02:32:38,310
I'm having to eat after I perform and 
it's like,

3299
02:32:38,311 --> 02:32:43,311
oh,
that means I can't eat until the 

3300
02:32:43,311 --> 02:32:43,311
afternoon.
I don't fuck with it on the road,

3301
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:48,440
on the road.
The most important thing to me is a 

3302
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:48,440
nutrition.
We're sleep and recovery,

3303
02:32:48,440 --> 02:32:52,791
sleep and exercise.
If I don't exercise when I'm on the 

3304
02:32:52,791 --> 02:32:52,830
road,
I get off because uh,

3305
02:32:52,890 --> 02:32:54,330
you know,
the flying and everything,

3306
02:32:54,331 --> 02:32:59,331
I feel like your body needs to exert in 
order to release endorphins and sorta 

3307
02:32:59,331 --> 02:32:59,460
like that's why as soon as I walked in 
the door here,

3308
02:32:59,461 --> 02:33:04,461
I grabbed the Kettlebell because I just 
haven't been able to do any of that 

3309
02:33:04,461 --> 02:33:04,461
stuff for a minute.

3310
02:33:04,461 --> 02:33:08,000
And so I've been here,
been in basically on my back for the 

3311
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:11,601
last three days.
I got some weird stomach thing or don't 

3312
02:33:11,601 --> 02:33:14,580
have a bad piece of baked brie or 
something and like knives and my stomach

3313
02:33:14,581 --> 02:33:17,970
for two days.
I was a dowery blaming on cheese.

3314
02:33:17,971 --> 02:33:19,950
I'm blaming it on.
I was going to blame it on you,

3315
02:33:19,951 --> 02:33:24,951
but I just got here though.
You can't blame it on code js code pay 

3316
02:33:24,951 --> 02:33:29,680
for Bri.
I'm going to talk to bake bread again 

3317
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:30,630
today.
Are you one of those raw cheese guys?

3318
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:32,820
Do you prefer the raw cheese?
Um,

3319
02:33:33,780 --> 02:33:34,950
I like,
I like cheese.

3320
02:33:34,951 --> 02:33:36,930
I try not to eat a lot of it just 
because again,

3321
02:33:36,931 --> 02:33:39,540
anything that's too much of anything is 
too much.

3322
02:33:39,541 --> 02:33:40,650
So yeah,
I agree.

3323
02:33:40,651 --> 02:33:44,610
But what I've found is that raw milk and
raw cheese in particular,

3324
02:33:44,611 --> 02:33:49,611
both those things,
I seem to digest them way easier than I 

3325
02:33:49,611 --> 02:33:49,611
do the pasteurized and homogenized 
first.

3326
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:50,490
I mean,
but are you,

3327
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:51,910
how are you getting it?
Are you getting it?

3328
02:33:52,390 --> 02:33:56,050
I actually have that in the US because 
you can get raw cheese at whole foods.

3329
02:33:57,900 --> 02:33:58,830
There's so many.
Yeah.

3330
02:33:58,831 --> 02:34:00,540
Yeah.
Can get the foreign.

3331
02:34:01,110 --> 02:34:06,110
Yeah.
But like they actually making cheese in 

3332
02:34:06,110 --> 02:34:06,110
the US.
It's a good question.

3333
02:34:06,110 --> 02:34:06,600
Is an awful hurdle.
Like.

3334
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Yeah,
because they want you to pasteurize 

3335
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,430
everything.
Like cheese in the US isn't nearly as 

3336
02:34:13,430 --> 02:34:16,070
wonderful and tasty is that is a firm in
your cs just because of all the process 

3337
02:34:16,681 --> 02:34:18,060
that you've had,
like raw

3338
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:19,930
stuff from a farm and go check it out.

3339
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:22,680
Dude.
I have burrata cheese in Italy and I was

3340
02:34:22,681 --> 02:34:24,660
like,
how do I get this home?

3341
02:34:24,930 --> 02:34:26,280
You don't.
You move to Italy,

3342
02:34:26,810 --> 02:34:31,810
you don't.
Could you even take Berata on an 

3343
02:34:31,810 --> 02:34:31,810
airplane?
Would they let you.

3344
02:34:31,810 --> 02:34:33,510
They might not write,
smuggle it.

3345
02:34:33,810 --> 02:34:38,810
Well,
I had a friend who was French and he 

3346
02:34:38,810 --> 02:34:39,120
came picturing right now,
right little little balloon.

3347
02:34:39,300 --> 02:34:44,300
I had a friend who was French from 
France and he had to hide his cheese 

3348
02:34:44,300 --> 02:34:45,570
because he had raw cheese.
He had a hide it in his luggage,

3349
02:34:45,810 --> 02:34:48,150
so you have to like folded up inside his
pants.

3350
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:53,240
Like these bricks have wheels of cheese.
He had to like put his parents are 

3351
02:34:53,240 --> 02:34:55,920
stuffed in his luggage to hide cheese.
They make it back and she's made it back

3352
02:34:55,921 --> 02:34:56,940
in.
Yeah,

3353
02:34:57,480 --> 02:35:00,510
he was his name and his address.
I can't tell you can't tell you.

3354
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:02,400
He actually moved back to France.
He's like,

3355
02:35:02,401 --> 02:35:05,970
fuck this place.
But when he lived here they used to make

3356
02:35:05,971 --> 02:35:10,971
this raw cheese and like charcuterie 
plate.

3357
02:35:11,161 --> 02:35:15,780
They would like cook raw cheese,
melted on the different smoked meats and

3358
02:35:15,810 --> 02:35:17,640
Oh,
I forget the name of it,

3359
02:35:17,790 --> 02:35:22,790
the name of the dish.
But it was sensational and they would 

3360
02:35:22,790 --> 02:35:25,491
eat it with like Sauerkraut,
the art of eating you out of eating and 

3361
02:35:26,641 --> 02:35:28,950
food to real art.
Right?

3362
02:35:29,070 --> 02:35:30,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

3363
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:32,220
I think the trick when you get into 
that,

3364
02:35:32,221 --> 02:35:35,880
you start getting into that gluttonous,
a activity with your,

3365
02:35:35,910 --> 02:35:38,070
with your,
with your world eeo.

3366
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:43,760
It's the moderation part because you get
caught up in like Morris better and 

3367
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:47,600
cramming it in and just being able to 
slow down and actually enjoy those 

3368
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:48,010
experiences without just,

3369
02:35:48,850 --> 02:35:50,630
without going full blown.
Gerard,

3370
02:35:50,910 --> 02:35:55,910
you put,
if he put like a plate of prosciutto in 

3371
02:35:55,910 --> 02:35:58,411
front of me,
I'm fucked for a week because I'll eat 

3372
02:35:58,411 --> 02:35:58,411
all of it.
I to.

3373
02:35:58,411 --> 02:35:59,260
Yeah,
I eat that stuff a lot because it's,

3374
02:35:59,261 --> 02:36:01,930
it's healthy.
It's like if you get like real good,

3375
02:36:01,931 --> 02:36:05,560
naturally cured,
you get lots of healthy fats from it.

3376
02:36:05,910 --> 02:36:09,310
So it's a great way to get a little 
package of protein.

3377
02:36:09,311 --> 02:36:11,380
You know,
you just open it up and dig in there.

3378
02:36:11,381 --> 02:36:14,230
That's a good key to genic snack.
I did that one.

3379
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:19,120
Yeah.
I always recommend MERC systems book the

3380
02:36:19,121 --> 02:36:24,121
primal blueprint and he's the guy though
that came on the podcast and apparently 

3381
02:36:24,121 --> 02:36:25,590
he's incorrect about some wine stuff and
I was wondering.

3382
02:36:26,430 --> 02:36:27,790
Yeah,
what did he say he sending?

3383
02:36:27,850 --> 02:36:29,120
Talking about Kevin Vernon

3384
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:31,190
wine and he made some mistakes.
Right?

3385
02:36:31,220 --> 02:36:36,220
Well,
I think there's a lot of misconceptions 

3386
02:36:36,220 --> 02:36:37,070
about winemaking,
commercial,

3387
02:36:37,400 --> 02:36:38,840
large scale.
Why making.

3388
02:36:38,841 --> 02:36:40,910
I've seen a lot of things happen in 
sellers,

3389
02:36:40,911 --> 02:36:43,370
large scale sellers that are cutting 
corners.

3390
02:36:43,371 --> 02:36:45,320
It's just a lot of things that they have
to do,

3391
02:36:45,321 --> 02:36:49,700
but there's this idea that there's all 
these things that we're adding to our,

3392
02:36:50,090 --> 02:36:53,090
to our wines,
give you headaches and fuck you up.

3393
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:54,170
So in,
you know,

3394
02:36:54,230 --> 02:36:57,050
in our vineyard we do have copper sprays
and things that are kind of a,

3395
02:36:57,130 --> 02:37:01,250
we're avoiding a frost or we're avoiding
bunch rot.

3396
02:37:01,530 --> 02:37:03,320
A copper sprays.
Yeah.

3397
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:04,260
It's,
yeah,

3398
02:37:04,320 --> 02:37:05,450
it's a long story.
Um,

3399
02:37:05,930 --> 02:37:08,830
but you know,
it's organic stuff we're trying to do to

3400
02:37:09,110 --> 02:37:11,000
address the actual copper.
Uh,

3401
02:37:11,001 --> 02:37:14,000
I'm not sure if it's actual copper or 
not.

3402
02:37:14,030 --> 02:37:15,800
I would imagine it's no.
Huh?

3403
02:37:16,410 --> 02:37:17,510
I don't know.
Okay.

3404
02:37:17,630 --> 02:37:22,630
I don't know the answer to that,
but that's just something that you're 

3405
02:37:22,630 --> 02:37:25,621
doing in the,
in the vineyard that are kind of like a 

3406
02:37:25,621 --> 02:37:29,200
organic practices that are acceptable,
but one of the things when the fruit 

3407
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:32,190
actually gets to the winery,
uh,

3408
02:37:32,630 --> 02:37:36,680
I'm inoculating it with a,
a pro,

3409
02:37:37,100 --> 02:37:39,890
a packaged yeast,
so something that might be an isolate is

3410
02:37:39,891 --> 02:37:42,410
trained from Barolo or from Tuscany.

3411
02:37:43,070 --> 02:37:44,840
Uh,
but other than that,

3412
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:50,200
at the end of the process,
we'll add a kms and so to solution to,

3413
02:37:51,380 --> 02:37:56,380
to stabilize the wine,
to keep it bottled with safe in the 

3414
02:37:56,380 --> 02:37:56,380
bottle.
But what does kms stand for?

3415
02:37:56,380 --> 02:37:59,390
Sulfur where we actually were salt.
We're adding sulfites to the wine,

3416
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:03,980
but wine itself actually produces.
Those byproducts were just,

3417
02:38:04,310 --> 02:38:08,570
were just escalating it to make sure 
that this wine can make it on a truck to

3418
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:12,440
New Jersey or to whatever and they blow 
off that go away.

3419
02:38:12,770 --> 02:38:16,220
So that's A.
Yeah.

3420
02:38:16,221 --> 02:38:21,221
Basically just kind of preserves it.
And some places that are paranoid about 

3421
02:38:21,291 --> 02:38:23,920
where that wine is going and how long 
it's going to be sitting in a truck.

3422
02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:25,370
And maybe it's not going to be 
refrigerated.

3423
02:38:25,610 --> 02:38:30,610
They're probably adding a little bit too
much and there's some places that are 

3424
02:38:30,610 --> 02:38:30,610
actually adding,
you know,

3425
02:38:30,610 --> 02:38:31,700
other weird stuff,
you know,

3426
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:35,270
enzymes and stuff into their wines and 
in the process.

3427
02:38:35,270 --> 02:38:39,620
But in my cellar it's basically,
it's the yeast holes,

3428
02:38:39,621 --> 02:38:44,621
it's the,
it's the yeast and at the end it's 

3429
02:38:44,621 --> 02:38:44,830
[inaudible].
We're not doing any other weird added.

3430
02:38:44,831 --> 02:38:49,831
Oh.
So the idea that there's like all these 

3431
02:38:49,831 --> 02:38:52,000
chemicals and all these extra things 
were jamming and do our wines is 

3432
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:53,240
ridiculous.
So it's just a misconception.

3433
02:38:53,450 --> 02:38:54,140
I think so.
Yeah.

3434
02:38:54,190 --> 02:38:56,270
I mean,
but are there any wine companies that do

3435
02:38:56,271 --> 02:38:57,200
that?
I'm sure,

3436
02:38:57,230 --> 02:38:58,250
yeah.
There's a lot of stuff.

3437
02:38:58,251 --> 02:38:59,180
People that are adding,
you know,

3438
02:38:59,210 --> 02:39:01,790
they're adding a,
what they call mega purple.

3439
02:39:01,791 --> 02:39:04,220
They're adding like tannins and they're 
adding color and the wood is,

3440
02:39:04,300 --> 02:39:09,300
oh,
so adding like weird nutrients on this 

3441
02:39:09,300 --> 02:39:09,300
end and wording,
you know,

3442
02:39:09,300 --> 02:39:10,940
while we have nutrients on that end and 
some nitrogen on this end,

3443
02:39:10,941 --> 02:39:11,260
they're,
you know,

3444
02:39:11,261 --> 02:39:14,720
they're adding a lot of extra stuff in 
the process that,

3445
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:20,020
you know,
I don't do it because we're doing very 

3446
02:39:20,020 --> 02:39:22,661
small batches of things and then they 
don't have to alert people what they're 

3447
02:39:22,661 --> 02:39:22,661
putting in either.

3448
02:39:22,661 --> 02:39:22,661
I mean,
it's just wine.

3449
02:39:22,661 --> 02:39:24,830
You get a bottle one,
you assume it's just wine.

3450
02:39:25,370 --> 02:39:26,560
Yeah.
Um,

3451
02:39:26,670 --> 02:39:31,670
I think that's changing.
I think the FDA's threatening to stick 

3452
02:39:31,670 --> 02:39:31,670
their nose into,
uh,

3453
02:39:31,670 --> 02:39:33,320
into wineries now,
which is a pain in the ass,

3454
02:39:34,110 --> 02:39:39,110
you know,
they want to know where everything's 

3455
02:39:39,110 --> 02:39:39,670
coming from and going to and really all 
the shit that's going on.

3456
02:39:39,690 --> 02:39:42,840
You can deal with a group over move 
books.

3457
02:39:42,870 --> 02:39:44,030
The one.
Yeah,

3458
02:39:44,060 --> 02:39:47,710
we're going to moon pool.
So for you're new,

3459
02:39:47,770 --> 02:39:52,770
you're just doing for the last 3000 
years they were adding husks.

3460
02:39:53,961 --> 02:39:57,560
Bookton ruin the diva.
What husks we're.

3461
02:39:59,570 --> 02:40:00,290
Yeah.
So,

3462
02:40:00,380 --> 02:40:04,700
um,
so when you're,

3463
02:40:04,730 --> 02:40:09,730
when you're adding the stuff to the wine
and you say that it burns off like 

3464
02:40:09,730 --> 02:40:12,530
you're adding sulfites are sulfate 
sulfur softening software just as a,

3465
02:40:12,531 --> 02:40:14,100
as a preserve,
is there

3466
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:16,200
an ideal?
Was off I should say?

3467
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:18,570
Okay.
When you bottle of wine,

3468
02:40:18,571 --> 02:40:22,500
is there an ideal time after you borrow 
that wine where it should be consumed?

3469
02:40:23,950 --> 02:40:28,950
Um,
I mean you can bottle it the minute you 

3470
02:40:28,950 --> 02:40:29,230
can open up to the minute it's bottle if
you want to,

3471
02:40:29,290 --> 02:40:30,250
if you want to open it up.

3472
02:40:30,370 --> 02:40:32,910
But this era,
where does the,

3473
02:40:33,250 --> 02:40:35,170
like when we drank that wind from like 
19,

3474
02:40:35,171 --> 02:40:38,830
24 or whatever the fuck it was that good
or is that different?

3475
02:40:39,250 --> 02:40:39,730
I mean it's like

3476
02:40:39,780 --> 02:40:43,050
it's all good wine.
This is a long conversation,

3477
02:40:43,051 --> 02:40:45,720
but you know,
winds in theory,

3478
02:40:45,721 --> 02:40:50,721
there's places that,
that just the natural structure of that 

3479
02:40:50,721 --> 02:40:50,721
place,
the Ph,

3480
02:40:50,721 --> 02:40:55,230
the asset balances of those places and 
depending on how well or not.

3481
02:40:55,231 --> 02:41:00,231
Well,
the wine maker got out of the way to 

3482
02:41:00,231 --> 02:41:00,231
make sure that,
that one,

3483
02:41:00,231 --> 02:41:00,660
that wine made it into a bottle.
It was proper,

3484
02:41:01,160 --> 02:41:01,930
uh,
the,

3485
02:41:02,010 --> 02:41:03,270
the storage of it.
The,

3486
02:41:03,460 --> 02:41:04,530
the Cork,
how that,

3487
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:05,940
how that went.
There's so many,

3488
02:41:05,941 --> 02:41:07,350
so many,
so many variables,

3489
02:41:07,860 --> 02:41:12,860
but when you're talking about the track 
record of a particular site and a 

3490
02:41:12,860 --> 02:41:14,130
producer,
um,

3491
02:41:14,280 --> 02:41:15,480
there are,
you know,

3492
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:19,200
there are wines that you just expect.
If I'm going to buy this Latour,

3493
02:41:19,201 --> 02:41:24,201
I'm going to buy a this fine burgundy.
You expected that wine has been held to 

3494
02:41:25,111 --> 02:41:29,520
a standard for a long period of time,
like all throughout decades,

3495
02:41:29,550 --> 02:41:31,000
millennia,
uh,

3496
02:41:31,050 --> 02:41:32,760
they have been consistent.

3497
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:38,000
So you expect that I should be able to 
lay this wind down for 50 years and it 

3498
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,920
should be okay.
It'll be different in 50 years.

3499
02:41:41,210 --> 02:41:43,620
I'm provided none of those other 
variables.

3500
02:41:44,010 --> 02:41:47,430
Like somebody didn't pull it out and 
leave it on the counter in the sun for a

3501
02:41:47,431 --> 02:41:50,160
week and then put it back on the seller 
and 50 years later you open it.

3502
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:53,520
It's crap all would take off.
Yeah.

3503
02:41:53,530 --> 02:41:55,740
And that's,
that's the heater sun itself.

3504
02:41:57,570 --> 02:41:59,850
It could be cold,
it could be something that goes to,

3505
02:41:59,851 --> 02:42:01,380
gets too cold,
it gets too dry.

3506
02:42:01,381 --> 02:42:05,130
The cork dries out.
It leaks that oxygen gets in a heat.

3507
02:42:05,131 --> 02:42:08,130
Is your enemy is your enemy oxygen as 
your enemy,

3508
02:42:08,230 --> 02:42:12,300
so as long as it's treated correctly,
it could last a long time and it'll just

3509
02:42:12,310 --> 02:42:13,140
change and

3510
02:42:13,390 --> 02:42:13,870
it'll,
yeah,

3511
02:42:13,871 --> 02:42:17,470
it'll evolve over time and it will,
there's definitely an art to it.

3512
02:42:17,471 --> 02:42:18,580
There's like,
there's definitely like,

3513
02:42:18,581 --> 02:42:19,150
okay,
that,

3514
02:42:19,210 --> 02:42:21,790
that particular wine was ready to.
There's a peak,

3515
02:42:22,120 --> 02:42:23,590
that's the shadow,
drank it.

3516
02:42:23,591 --> 02:42:24,070
Right.
Then

3517
02:42:24,180 --> 02:42:29,180
how do you know,
do you know from reading like articles 

3518
02:42:29,180 --> 02:42:29,180
or

3519
02:42:29,180 --> 02:42:29,180
again,
it's,

3520
02:42:29,180 --> 02:42:29,640
it's,
you know,

3521
02:42:29,970 --> 02:42:34,140
it's some,
that's why I buy some guys buy a case or

3522
02:42:34,141 --> 02:42:39,141
two cases of wine that they know they're
going to like and they're trying them 

3523
02:42:39,141 --> 02:42:42,591
over time and they're figuring it out 
and then they'll have that wine and 

3524
02:42:42,591 --> 02:42:43,110
they'll go,
hey guys,

3525
02:42:43,111 --> 02:42:48,111
I just had a,
the 10th bottle of wine from those 24 

3526
02:42:48,111 --> 02:42:51,270
bottles and it's starting to go over the
hill.

3527
02:42:51,810 --> 02:42:54,540
So there's a little forum or somebody to
call on each other back and forth going,

3528
02:42:54,541 --> 02:42:56,700
hey,
I think this particular wine is,

3529
02:42:56,730 --> 02:42:58,110
is,
is,

3530
02:42:58,140 --> 02:43:00,450
has seen its best day.
Uh,

3531
02:43:00,510 --> 02:43:02,160
and they'll get back online and somebody
will go,

3532
02:43:02,370 --> 02:43:03,300
no,
mine's fire.

3533
02:43:03,301 --> 02:43:04,950
You know,
the arguments about that.

3534
02:43:04,951 --> 02:43:09,951
But generally speaking,
it's that communication of guys saying 

3535
02:43:09,951 --> 02:43:09,951
that's interesting.

3536
02:43:09,951 --> 02:43:12,100
So it requires like a community of

3537
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:15,220
knowledgeable people to communicate 
about it.

3538
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:16,870
Yeah.
I have a buddy of mine,

3539
02:43:16,871 --> 02:43:20,710
he's a fucking total wine,
not invited me to his birthday party and

3540
02:43:20,720 --> 02:43:24,610
it was a wine tasting birthday party and
they were all sitting around like.

3541
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:27,130
And they would judge the wine 
afterwards.

3542
02:43:28,040 --> 02:43:31,210
It's very oaky.
There's hints of Tannin and I'd be like,

3543
02:43:31,211 --> 02:43:36,211
what in the fuck are you guys take?
And one of them that they didn't like 

3544
02:43:36,211 --> 02:43:36,211
were like,
this one's corked.

3545
02:43:36,211 --> 02:43:37,180
I think this one's corked.
It was like,

3546
02:43:37,780 --> 02:43:40,030
this one's my favorite.
I really liked this one.

3547
02:43:40,040 --> 02:43:41,710
You tell me it's bad.
This is bad.

3548
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:43,690
Like cows it bad.
Like how do you know it's bad?

3549
02:43:44,380 --> 02:43:48,130
It seems like it's corked.
Like do,

3550
02:43:48,420 --> 02:43:50,470
does that drive you crazy?
They're super busy.

3551
02:43:51,850 --> 02:43:54,490
So there's like a level of 
pretentiousness that's acceptable.

3552
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:57,120
Again,
everybody wants to kind,

3553
02:43:57,130 --> 02:44:00,700
trying find their way in life and try to
find what makes them better than,

3554
02:44:00,701 --> 02:44:04,000
or different than or separates them or 
elevates them because pallets.

3555
02:44:04,001 --> 02:44:06,010
Amazing.
His Palette is incredible.

3556
02:44:06,040 --> 02:44:10,120
He's going to be able to tell when he 
ties it and you get some fat ass.

3557
02:44:10,300 --> 02:44:11,900
Orson Welles dude sitting there.

3558
02:44:14,210 --> 02:44:15,760
Yeah.
If you know,

3559
02:44:16,030 --> 02:44:18,880
after a couple of classes,
if that thing's not really torqued,

3560
02:44:18,940 --> 02:44:20,760
I'm drinking it.
Yeah.

3561
02:44:20,770 --> 02:44:22,810
Right.
Especially after a couple of glasses.

3562
02:44:23,710 --> 02:44:26,500
In the olden days they used to drink 
wine because water would go bad,

3563
02:44:26,501 --> 02:44:27,630
right?
Yeah.

3564
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:28,610
The,
well the,

3565
02:44:29,130 --> 02:44:33,040
well still water sit around.
It would still water.

3566
02:44:33,100 --> 02:44:34,450
But also,
um,

3567
02:44:34,570 --> 02:44:39,570
you know,
if you have in this situation where you 

3568
02:44:39,570 --> 02:44:39,570
have like,
you know,

3569
02:44:39,570 --> 02:44:41,980
like New Orleans complete devastation of
a,

3570
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:47,160
of the water table.
There's like decomposing bodies 

3571
02:44:47,160 --> 02:44:48,010
everywhere and you can't drink the 
groundwater.

3572
02:44:48,011 --> 02:44:49,630
You can't trust what's coming out of 
your.

3573
02:44:49,631 --> 02:44:50,490
Well,
you know,

3574
02:44:50,710 --> 02:44:55,710
um,
fermented fermented juice is what you 

3575
02:44:55,710 --> 02:44:57,780
would drink if it's safe because it's 
gone through fermentation process.

3576
02:44:57,790 --> 02:45:00,700
A process of purification,
just like vodka.

3577
02:45:00,701 --> 02:45:01,960
The water of life,
you know,

3578
02:45:01,990 --> 02:45:04,630
it's the water that doesn't freeze.
So you can go through the Tundra.

3579
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:07,150
If you had an eat snow,
you're going to freeze to death.

3580
02:45:07,540 --> 02:45:09,700
If you try to like melt the snow,
you're building.

3581
02:45:09,701 --> 02:45:14,701
If you do have a fire but they actual 
water of vodka doesn't freeze and you 

3582
02:45:14,701 --> 02:45:19,651
can actually survive.
You have to have water while you're 

3583
02:45:19,651 --> 02:45:22,080
walking through this frozen Tundra and 
get the benefit of being drunk all the 

3584
02:45:22,080 --> 02:45:23,070
time.
Drunk as fuck in a snowbank yeah.

3585
02:45:23,071 --> 02:45:26,800
Like Vikings had a big ass leather sack 
full of wine.

3586
02:45:26,801 --> 02:45:28,160
There were always hammered.
Yeah.

3587
02:45:28,390 --> 02:45:31,210
No wonder why they had such a ridiculous
behavior.

3588
02:45:31,470 --> 02:45:36,430
They're drunk all the time.
She's eating mushrooms and Reagan made.

3589
02:45:36,940 --> 02:45:39,190
That's wind or that's what it's made out
of,

3590
02:45:39,320 --> 02:45:40,640
honey.
Yeah.

3591
02:45:41,020 --> 02:45:41,820
Honey.
Wine.

3592
02:45:41,830 --> 02:45:42,790
Beer.
Yeah.

3593
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:44,170
Honeys a weird preservative.
Right?

3594
02:45:44,171 --> 02:45:46,960
Because it doesn't go bad ever.
Yeah,

3595
02:45:47,050 --> 02:45:47,790
I like it.
Hey,

3596
02:45:47,791 --> 02:45:49,030
you can take things in.
Honey.

3597
02:45:49,031 --> 02:45:51,370
You stuff.
I'm in honey and they just stay good.

3598
02:45:51,670 --> 02:45:54,760
They think that's one of the things that
led to the iphone five.

3599
02:45:55,240 --> 02:45:57,040
Is it work good on honey?
What do you mean?

3600
02:45:57,041 --> 02:46:00,720
Still preserved as looking at different.
You still use an iphone five.

3601
02:46:00,730 --> 02:46:02,770
You one of those guys.
That's the iphone six.

3602
02:46:02,950 --> 02:46:04,190
I'm just kidding,
but you have a,

3603
02:46:04,480 --> 02:46:08,440
you have a port for the headphones,
phone port.

3604
02:46:08,500 --> 02:46:11,650
So we stopped changing.
That's where we draw the line.

3605
02:46:11,651 --> 02:46:16,651
I draw the line and they had from port.
A lot of people do like that's where I 

3606
02:46:16,651 --> 02:46:16,890
draw the line.
But uh,

3607
02:46:17,210 --> 02:46:18,310
so meade,
what,

3608
02:46:18,320 --> 02:46:23,320
like I'd read something where they were 
speculating that one of the conversions 

3609
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:27,851
from mushroom culture to meed cause they
think that we used to be like our,

3610
02:46:28,231 --> 02:46:29,960
um,
the intoxicants.

3611
02:46:29,961 --> 02:46:33,800
We're primarily psychedelic and then 
they went to alcohol,

3612
02:46:33,950 --> 02:46:38,950
some point in human history and that,
that might've coincided with people 

3613
02:46:38,950 --> 02:46:43,211
trying to preserve mushrooms in honey 
and that they produce some sort of a 

3614
02:46:43,211 --> 02:46:46,700
honey mushroom chemical reaction that 
the honey actually fermented.

3615
02:46:46,780 --> 02:46:51,780
Yeah.
And then people started drinking meat 

3616
02:46:51,780 --> 02:46:51,970
and then meat culture changed the way 
people,

3617
02:46:52,070 --> 02:46:54,260
alcohol culture,
which is like an aggressive,

3618
02:46:54,860 --> 02:46:55,640
you know,
loose,

3619
02:46:55,641 --> 02:46:57,950
losing inhibitions,
wild culture.

3620
02:46:58,760 --> 02:47:02,210
Is there any movement to bring back 
those leather wind socks,

3621
02:47:02,690 --> 02:47:03,230
you know,
those.

3622
02:47:03,320 --> 02:47:06,290
What are those things called?
Those things that the um,

3623
02:47:06,490 --> 02:47:10,720
that went and the vikings had to carry 
him around those leather sacks,

3624
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:13,460
bladder,
the wind bladder.

3625
02:47:13,461 --> 02:47:16,200
Um,
any benefit to drinking,

3626
02:47:16,930 --> 02:47:21,930
I think I need you to roll in to 
augustine wine bar with a fucking 

3627
02:47:21,930 --> 02:47:24,020
bladder and a fucking horned helmets.
Right?

3628
02:47:24,110 --> 02:47:27,650
Drink your ale from one of the day as 
bullhorn things.

3629
02:47:28,490 --> 02:47:29,300
Do they,
I mean,

3630
02:47:29,301 --> 02:47:30,260
does anybody,
um,

3631
02:47:30,290 --> 02:47:35,290
serve wine out of like a leather thing?
I would feel like that's like the next 

3632
02:47:35,290 --> 02:47:37,370
Mumford and sons should be time to do 
what they do.

3633
02:47:37,371 --> 02:47:42,371
Growler.
So if you're walking into a andover was 

3634
02:47:42,371 --> 02:47:43,670
a beer bar,
I think there allow you to bring in,

3635
02:47:44,290 --> 02:47:49,290
if it's a measured out,
what that volume is and you can refill 

3636
02:47:49,290 --> 02:47:49,290
your growler.

3637
02:47:49,290 --> 02:47:49,940
Uh,
with beer.

3638
02:47:50,570 --> 02:47:52,610
I think some places do the same with 
wine.

3639
02:47:53,020 --> 02:47:53,510
Uh,
the big,

3640
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:56,150
the big issue is,
is the labeling.

3641
02:47:56,180 --> 02:47:56,720
So like,
you know,

3642
02:47:56,721 --> 02:47:59,630
the ttp gets all weird and the liquor 
department gets all weird because like,

3643
02:47:59,631 --> 02:48:03,020
well the bottle has all the labeling on 
it that I need to make sure that you're,

3644
02:48:03,190 --> 02:48:05,990
are you pregnant because there's a 
warning on here about that.

3645
02:48:06,430 --> 02:48:11,430
Um,
so if you're just coming in and filling 

3646
02:48:11,430 --> 02:48:13,451
your growler with wine,
I think the assumption is that at some 

3647
02:48:13,451 --> 02:48:14,180
point you,
you know,

3648
02:48:14,210 --> 02:48:15,550
violate the law.
Yeah.

3649
02:48:15,590 --> 02:48:17,240
I don't know or not.
I don't know.

3650
02:48:17,270 --> 02:48:18,500
It seems kind of weird to me.
Yeah,

3651
02:48:18,501 --> 02:48:20,900
just fill up.
Just let the Guy Philip is thing.

3652
02:48:21,020 --> 02:48:26,020
Have you ever thought about 
experimenting with like a leather 

3653
02:48:26,020 --> 02:48:26,600
bladder for your wine to see if it 
influences the taste?

3654
02:48:26,601 --> 02:48:28,490
We did one for a,
not a leather one,

3655
02:48:28,491 --> 02:48:32,060
but did like a plastic one for um,
uh,

3656
02:48:32,061 --> 02:48:33,740
we do a wine garden.

3657
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:35,100
What do you got there?
That's the,

3658
02:48:35,130 --> 02:48:38,360
that's the bladder on the range that 
rock on the range.

3659
02:48:38,361 --> 02:48:41,090
We did it at um,
uh,

3660
02:48:41,140 --> 02:48:44,480
after aftershock we had like a wine.
I could ucs American wine booth.

3661
02:48:44,481 --> 02:48:47,900
We did one down in Florida for a couple 
of festivals.

3662
02:48:47,901 --> 02:48:49,970
And does it affect the taste at all 
being in that?

3663
02:48:50,080 --> 02:48:50,730
Yeah,
I mean,

3664
02:48:50,900 --> 02:48:54,110
well if you're in the middle of a field 
with a bunch of shitty bands playing,

3665
02:48:54,140 --> 02:48:55,960
it's going to taste different.
You know,

3666
02:48:57,250 --> 02:49:00,110
it's hot and you're annoyed.
So yeah,

3667
02:49:00,111 --> 02:49:03,080
it's going to taste different.
Even drink it because you're annoyed and

3668
02:49:04,010 --> 02:49:09,010
do you have recommended temperatures 
that your wine should be stored or 

3669
02:49:09,010 --> 02:49:09,010
served that?
Yeah,

3670
02:49:09,010 --> 02:49:10,020
I mean just normal.
A normal seller,

3671
02:49:10,170 --> 02:49:12,370
a seller,
cellaring anyone.

3672
02:49:12,570 --> 02:49:17,570
That'd be nice if you could put it at 
like 50 degrees and you're in your wine 

3673
02:49:17,570 --> 02:49:19,740
cellar.
A good spot for it.

3674
02:49:20,310 --> 02:49:22,610
40 slash 40 slash $45.
That's what you want,

3675
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:25,350
but you don't want to put in your fridge
because it's going to get too cold.

3676
02:49:25,450 --> 02:49:26,820
Well yeah,
if it's,

3677
02:49:26,821 --> 02:49:28,380
if it's,
if you're going to drink it fairly right

3678
02:49:28,381 --> 02:49:29,610
away.
If you go to the store and you got to,

3679
02:49:29,670 --> 02:49:34,670
you're going to get a bottle of wine.
You want to cram in the fridge for the 

3680
02:49:34,670 --> 02:49:34,670
day to open it up that night,
that's fine.

3681
02:49:34,670 --> 02:49:36,180
But if you store your wine in the 
fridge,

3682
02:49:36,480 --> 02:49:38,230
that's a little too cold.
Oh,

3683
02:49:38,360 --> 02:49:40,350
be storing it.
I've done that before.

3684
02:49:40,410 --> 02:49:43,180
But it's better than leaving it out in,
on top of your fish.

3685
02:49:43,181 --> 02:49:45,950
Court's going to get baked.
So it's Kinda like way out.

3686
02:49:46,220 --> 02:49:51,220
Your House is 70 degrees.
It shouldn't just leave it in your 

3687
02:49:51,220 --> 02:49:51,220
house.
Um,

3688
02:49:51,540 --> 02:49:56,540
you can,
as long as it's going to maintain 70 

3689
02:49:56,540 --> 02:49:56,670
supermarket though,
and they have those,

3690
02:49:56,671 --> 02:50:00,120
like it's all sitting there and yeah,
they're not doing anything about that.

3691
02:50:00,130 --> 02:50:05,130
Are you buying wine at a supermarket?
I don't know where else spa or should I 

3692
02:50:05,130 --> 02:50:05,130
go?
A nice wine shop that's gonna.

3693
02:50:05,130 --> 02:50:10,110
So pretentious.
It's like going on a cigar bars dealing 

3694
02:50:10,110 --> 02:50:10,110
with those guys.
Same thing.

3695
02:50:10,110 --> 02:50:15,040
It's like it's from Nicaragua.
Smelled the Secar Niqab.

3696
02:50:17,910 --> 02:50:22,910
Well,
this producer uses a lot of natural 

3697
02:50:22,910 --> 02:50:22,910
fermentation and they,
you know,

3698
02:50:22,910 --> 02:50:22,910
they definitely do it,
you know,

3699
02:50:22,910 --> 02:50:26,520
we worked and like Baba Blah Blah dorks 
baseball card dorks.

3700
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:28,450
The same person.
Yeah.

3701
02:50:28,460 --> 02:50:30,900
I'm just going after wines.
The baseball cards can.

3702
02:50:30,901 --> 02:50:33,570
I just had the fucking give me.
They give me a nigger.

3703
02:50:33,571 --> 02:50:35,760
Mandela and a lime and a bag of chips 
were good.

3704
02:50:35,770 --> 02:50:39,000
Model is a good one.
Oh good.

3705
02:50:39,480 --> 02:50:41,070
What do you.
A bag of lime and chips?

3706
02:50:41,360 --> 02:50:42,780
The lime?
A little lime juice.

3707
02:50:42,781 --> 02:50:45,030
And then the Magellan.
A bag of chips.

3708
02:50:45,080 --> 02:50:46,500
Woo.
Yeah,

3709
02:50:46,770 --> 02:50:51,770
under Maduro.
Like a dark cigar for the snack.

3710
02:50:51,901 --> 02:50:53,110
Let's do this.
Okay.

3711
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:54,850
Get yourself some shadow.
Nice.

3712
02:50:55,100 --> 02:50:57,030
What is that?
A pork rinds.

3713
02:50:57,090 --> 02:50:57,660
Oh,
okay.

3714
02:50:57,730 --> 02:50:58,520
Whew.
Pork rinds.

3715
02:50:58,560 --> 02:50:59,910
Luck.
I'm at a gas station.

3716
02:50:59,970 --> 02:51:02,250
A little bit,
a little bit of a sour cream,

3717
02:51:02,980 --> 02:51:05,670
a little bit of Valentino.
A hot sauce on that.

3718
02:51:05,940 --> 02:51:07,290
Oh,
it got cold.

3719
02:51:07,291 --> 02:51:09,120
You got he.
He got crunch.

3720
02:51:09,150 --> 02:51:11,610
You got salt.
You got sweet from the cream.

3721
02:51:11,940 --> 02:51:15,240
Now you one of those guys that will not 
drink a red wine with fish.

3722
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:16,620
I'll drink.
I don't.

3723
02:51:16,740 --> 02:51:18,220
Yeah,
I'll,

3724
02:51:18,770 --> 02:51:21,660
I'll.
I don't abide by those rules.

3725
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:27,080
I've had red wines that go with all 
things in white wines ago and rosaries 

3726
02:51:27,080 --> 02:51:27,840
that go with all things.
I'll try all of them,

3727
02:51:27,930 --> 02:51:28,950
but if the,
if,

3728
02:51:29,130 --> 02:51:32,670
if the experience isn't working,
I'll shift gears,

3729
02:51:33,150 --> 02:51:34,500
but I won't be afraid of.
I won't,

3730
02:51:34,590 --> 02:51:37,470
I won't be afraid.
I won't go with a set rule going in.

3731
02:51:37,650 --> 02:51:39,890
They used to be a hard fast rule,
right?

3732
02:51:40,060 --> 02:51:41,730
Wasn't kind of.
Yeah,

3733
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:43,740
in general,
I think it's more,

3734
02:51:43,741 --> 02:51:48,741
it's just more,
it's just more of something to talk 

3735
02:51:48,741 --> 02:51:49,530
about at the grocery store,
so it's like a fetish I'm having.

3736
02:51:49,620 --> 02:51:51,300
I'm having this for dinner.
What should I have?

3737
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:54,860
I think a red wine pairing.
Yeah.

3738
02:51:54,870 --> 02:51:59,870
Good parents here are these some,
some restaurants have a pairing with 

3739
02:51:59,870 --> 02:52:03,090
each selection and very rarely do you 
have a white wine with a bloody steak.

3740
02:52:03,810 --> 02:52:04,950
I do.
I'll do it.

3741
02:52:05,050 --> 02:52:06,160
It's crazy.
Have you lived

3742
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:07,660
on the edge though?
I'm on the edge.

3743
02:52:07,960 --> 02:52:10,930
You're out there right on the edge of 
the earth where it goes off.

3744
02:52:11,620 --> 02:52:14,060
Did we did a three hours already?
It's already gone by.

3745
02:52:14,270 --> 02:52:15,170
All right.
No,

3746
02:52:15,171 --> 02:52:15,750
that's.
Yeah,

3747
02:52:15,751 --> 02:52:17,920
it's pretty crazy.
How the fuck does that happen?

3748
02:52:18,370 --> 02:52:23,370
Got a workout in whenever you're in.
Did your stretch you things in the back 

3749
02:52:23,370 --> 02:52:23,370
there?
Oh,

3750
02:52:23,370 --> 02:52:23,750
did you know that thing with the back 
things?

3751
02:52:23,770 --> 02:52:24,540
Amazing.
Yeah,

3752
02:52:24,550 --> 02:52:25,960
I didn't do that.
I didn't do the one with the weights.

3753
02:52:25,961 --> 02:52:27,220
I just did the one me hanging upside 
down.

3754
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:32,600
Will.
I'll show it to you after we're done 

3755
02:52:32,600 --> 02:52:32,600
with us.
The things,

3756
02:52:32,600 --> 02:52:32,600
the shit.
Yeah.

3757
02:52:32,600 --> 02:52:32,980
Everybody should have one of those just 
for back maintenance.

3758
02:52:33,410 --> 02:52:38,410
That's Goddamn epic.
It just looks like it had too much 

3759
02:52:38,410 --> 02:52:38,410
weight on it.
No,

3760
02:52:38,410 --> 02:52:38,410
it's,
it's not that heavy.

3761
02:52:38,410 --> 02:52:42,901
It seems like it,
but it's like a perfect union of 

3762
02:52:42,901 --> 02:52:42,901
contrary things available.
Now,

3763
02:52:42,901 --> 02:52:47,501
ladies and gentlemen,
I suggest you go out and purchase it 

3764
02:52:47,501 --> 02:52:50,910
immediately.
We did a top Ten New York Times best 

3765
02:52:50,910 --> 02:52:53,721
seller.
Let's see what we can get this bitch up 

3766
02:52:53,721 --> 02:52:53,721
to.
Number One,

3767
02:52:53,721 --> 02:52:53,721
ladies and gentlemen,
come on.

3768
02:52:53,721 --> 02:52:55,010
Don't go buy it.
You know,

3769
02:52:55,030 --> 02:52:56,140
it's good.
He's wearing a wig.

3770
02:52:56,940 --> 02:53:00,760
A merkin come out.
Always a pleasure,

3771
02:53:00,770 --> 02:53:01,690
my brother,
sir.

3772
02:53:01,930 --> 02:53:02,800
Thank you.
Thank you.

3773
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:03,490
Always.
Awesome.

3774
02:53:12,400 --> 02:53:13,410
Mm.
