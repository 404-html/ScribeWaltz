1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,660
It is what it was.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,020
Just like any other problem
that people go back to.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,050
I mean at some point it's up to you to
release yourself from that obligation to

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,520
get upset or feel bad about something
that didn't go right in the past,

6
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:18,971
you know?

7
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:19,410
And uh,

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,130
that's a huge point because people
define themselves by the past instead of

9
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:27,450
thinking about who they are now instead
of they still look back at a mistake

10
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:29,490
they made and don't just
get past that mistake,

11
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:30,360
grow and learn,

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,470
but dwell on it.

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,670
I think it defines them.

14
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,670
That's the worst thing
I met some guys in band,

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,690
he says is a singers.

16
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,200
I've only met him twice,

17
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:38,991
two different times,

18
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:39,850
a years later.

19
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,721
Both Times.

20
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:42,190
He started telling me about the story,

21
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:43,960
about what happened to
him when he was in this.

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,320
Anything in this poor guy is gone on all
these years and he's still focused on

23
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:52,230
the worst situation that he
ever had to live through.

24
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:52,701
Yeah.

25
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:55,280
And it's so a attached to it.

26
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,350
Well some guys get one
break up and they're done.

27
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,191
Some guys,

28
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,190
one breakup in their twenties
will tank them for a decade.

29
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:02,840
I've met guys like that that,

30
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:03,171
yeah.

31
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:03,541
You know,

32
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,240
I came out here with Sally and you know,

33
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:08,090
she fucking fell in love
with their trainer and dude,

34
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,160
Sally still on.

35
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,050
What is that in fucking years ago.

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,740
Oh,

37
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:12,981
well,

38
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:13,281
you know,

39
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,330
changed my life bro.

40
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:14,820
But totally,

41
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,090
totally.

42
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,060
I was so disappointed I
can't trust women anymore.

43
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:17,870
Oh,

44
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,411
you stupid.

45
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,070
Fuck.

46
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,681
You know what?

47
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,370
What if he got mugged by one
person who'd done trust in people?

48
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,400
One person was a murderer.

49
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:26,300
Let's not trust anybody.

50
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,520
Yeah,

51
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,353
yeah.

52
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,730
I heard about Ted Bundy.

53
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:29,810
I'm not trusting people anymore.

54
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,201
Oh,

55
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:30,650
okay,

56
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:30,951
great.

57
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:31,940
I'm not sleeping tonight.

58
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,263
We,

59
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:34,790
yeah,

60
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,040
I mean there's definitely
pitfalls in life.

61
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,903
You're going to run into him.

62
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,720
We all are.

63
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,860
And you can learn and grow.

64
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:40,720
If you survive it,

65
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,720
pick yourself up yet,

66
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,230
dust the dust off and then you start
going and I don't let this stuff,

67
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,064
uh,

68
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,060
well let it beat you down.

69
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,660
It's also directly proportionate to the
amount of hardships that people face in

70
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:51,110
life.

71
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,580
Their ability to face hardships.

72
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,091
You know,

73
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:56,210
and there's a lot of folks that live
life on a cushy cloud of marshmallows and

74
00:01:56,211 --> 00:02:00,320
bullshit and then one day something
goes wrong and I mean that's why spoiled

75
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,790
kids are so sad.

76
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,820
Like a spoiled young boy is
one of the saddest things ever.

77
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,930
A young boy that becomes a man and can't
take care of himself and his dad has to

78
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:10,250
keep on rescuing him.

79
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,940
His Dad has to keep on bailing them out
of situations and giving them money.

80
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:18,170
I've met guys like that and that is a
crippling affliction when they don't have

81
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,540
the character themselves to
be able to get by in life.

82
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,960
They constantly need someone to
help them and bailed them out.

83
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,130
Even as a grown man,

84
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,150
I've met guys in their forties it's
still need help from their parents.

85
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:29,931
I'm like,

86
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:30,770
what the fuck,

87
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:31,520
man,

88
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,330
you're never going to get it right because
somewhere along the line they didn't

89
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:38,720
face enough of the university to realize
that there's sometimes we just got to

90
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:39,980
get up and get shit done.

91
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,210
There's sometimes we have to fucking
pull yourself up and you have to push

92
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:44,661
forward.

93
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:45,890
Even if you want to stay in the bed,

94
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,860
and if you don't do that and you just
keep calling on your daddy and your daddy

95
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:49,720
keeps rescuing you,

96
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,410
you never developed those tools,

97
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,920
you never developed that
ability to recognize what
you're doing wrong with your

98
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:55,520
life.

99
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,420
What's your age limit?

100
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,630
You would cut a check off at a
think I think around 55 whoa.

101
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,760
You're a generous man.

102
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,530
I mean it all depends.

103
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,200
It all depends on if she goes to yoga.

104
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,070
There's a,

105
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,500
there's some good looking
55 out there are now.

106
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,100
Yeah,

107
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,920
there are now scientific.

108
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,010
Have you seen Christie Brinkley?

109
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:15,851
Yes,

110
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:17,860
and that's exactly the type
of thing I'm talking about.

111
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,750
How old's Christie Brinkley
know she's up there.

112
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,010
She's hot as fuck.

113
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,270
He Seen Helen Hunt lately.

114
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:22,811
No,

115
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:23,644
I don't need to do that.

116
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,640
There's this movie called,

117
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,660
he's trying to kill my boner.

118
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,420
Frank Lucas bringing up Helen Hunt.

119
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,310
You're going the wrong way,

120
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,120
but you got to hear this picture of
Christy blanket to cleanse my palette.

121
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,140
There's this,

122
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,580
let's take this conversation slow.

123
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,663
This is getting exciting.

124
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,830
There was this movie called,

125
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,250
uh,

126
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,760
the session and if you just
look up the preview of it,

127
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,690
it's a about this guy that
has an iron lung and he's,

128
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,201
you know,

129
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,480
he's very like Stephen Hawking
and then maybe just laying there,

130
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,340
Greg Hall and stuff.

131
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,030
And so Helen Hunt's like his
therapist or something and he goes,

132
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:55,500
she's like,

133
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:55,660
oh,

134
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,590
you need to get laid.

135
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,560
So she starts taking off her
clothes and you see her full Bush.

136
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,050
Her body movie is this,

137
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:02,950
it's called the session.

138
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,940
It's just an old movie.

139
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:04,061
Oh,

140
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:07,820
this came out like two years ago and it's
just Helen Hunt fucking this retarded.

141
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,590
Not Retarded.

142
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,590
I this iron lung guy and
it's just creepy as fuck.

143
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,010
It's just a creepy version of
Helen Hunt or face looks weird.

144
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:15,180
Like,

145
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,580
okay.

146
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,600
And then you just see her Bush and
she's having sex for the whole movie.

147
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,371
Pull up that picture.

148
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:20,204
Sounds pretty good.

149
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,010
Christie.

150
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,080
Christie Brinkley Bitch disgusting me.

151
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,763
That's,

152
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,081
yeah,

153
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:26,914
that's current.

154
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,251
Okay.

155
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,510
And she's gotta be how old?

156
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,100
She's old and her throat though.

157
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,940
Whatever,

158
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,511
whatever.

159
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:32,400
Did Banana throw it,

160
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:33,234
a little tuck.

161
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,500
This validates my hair scarf,

162
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:36,580
getting rid of the horse riding.

163
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,690
I would make her drive in a convertible
and chase me around while I drove

164
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,640
station wagon up town girl.

165
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:42,801
Well,

166
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:46,160
if you compare the way she looks today
and the way she looked when she was with

167
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:46,994
Billy Joel,

168
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,140
not that difference.

169
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,310
Compare the way Billy Joel looks today
and the way Billy Joel looked when he was

170
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:53,144
with Christie Brinkley.

171
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,300
I think she's a vampire
and then she stole a soul.

172
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,390
Do you think this threat things caused
by cock just tons of caucus age,

173
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:00,921
bro,

174
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:02,030
your skin gets bad.

175
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,820
She's a 60 years old,

176
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,960
most likely she's 60 years old,

177
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,731
don't you?

178
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:09,110
Can't you don't respond to him with,

179
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,281
it's amazing.

180
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:13,240
She looks fantastic.

181
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,111
Absolutely.

182
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,690
That's as good as a 60 year old woman
has ever looked in the history of the

183
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,160
world and that's what I mean.

184
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,270
We're talking about exceptions.

185
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:19,690
When I say,

186
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:19,901
yeah,

187
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,490

188
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:21,911

looking at her and goes,

190
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:24,461

00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,630
she looks really good.

192
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,464
She's hot.

193
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,280
She's hot and her body's really nice too.

194
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,173
Yeah.

195
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,850
Christy full Shiran.

196
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,140
Kapow Kapow I'll take it.

197
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,550
I'll take it all day long.

198
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:36,701
Yeah.

199
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:37,534
You make out with her.

200
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,650
I take that throat cutter.

201
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,511
It's a prayer.

202
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:41,110
It's not that bad dude or throw.

203
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:41,891
It doesn't look bad.

204
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,030
You're focusing on the wrong thing.

205
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,510
Yeah.

206
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,230

209
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,160
You're going to be very
unfocused on that throat.

210
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:48,490
Gutters.

211
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:48,970
Weird.

212
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,510
Yeah.

213
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,350
It ain't that bad,

214
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:50,950

She's hot as fuck.

217
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:52,751
You're out of your mind.

218
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:53,710
You look at their neck,

219
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,050
you're looking at a still image cares.

220
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,120
Tom Shaffer.

221
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,203
Knack of it,

222
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,510
Brian.

223
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,070
That's nothing you're saying nothing.

224
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:05,360
You're making noise with your face.

225
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,710
You really frustrating me right now,

226
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:06,981

227
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:07,460
Yeah,

228
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,080
there's nothing going on
with what you're saying.

229
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,180
You just fixating on next.

230
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,770
Next get a lot worse.

231
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,420
We'll do whatever you want.

232
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,231
Okay,

233
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,300

234
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,133
We'll do whatever you want.

235
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,200
You just gotta do this first.

236
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,680
We'll listen to you.

237
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:23,630
Just give her a big fucking jar
of them with apple sauce mixed in.

238
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,770
Look at her.

239
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,810
The Joe Rogan kind of
hot in a weird milfy way.

240
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,100
No.

241
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,280
I can look at it as people's necks.

242
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:30,350
That's not even a real bro.

243
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:33,170
Use Photoshop that he did.

244
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,461
Brian.

245
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:34,671
Brian,

246
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:35,540
you hit the volume.

247
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,440
Jesus Christ.

248
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,310
What happened?

249
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,143
You fucking,

250
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,510
it's like a big Dick.

251
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,340
Their volume.

252
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,270
That Mexican fine.

253
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,363
Yeah.

254
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,353
Um,

255
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,580
did you have the headphone
didn't effect the recording?

256
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:46,790
No.

257
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,623
Just the headphones.

258
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,460
You Photoshop that you fuck?

259
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:49,641
No,

260
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:50,474
I did.

261
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,010
I think we're stupid.

262
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,873
That's a vagina.

263
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,753
It's on a Mac.

264
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,010
It's luckily she swallowed a bow and
Arrow that's going on in her neck.

265
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,220
There's a guy named Merrill Hill.

266
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,950
No,

267
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,111

268
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:00,944
it's not.

269
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,060
That's Christy.

270
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,893
Is it real?

271
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,890
It is.

272
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,320
No,

273
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,850
it's a real fun.

274
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,110
Did you really doctor that up?

275
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,531
Yeah,

276
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:08,630
of course it did you fuck how he thinks?

277
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:08,991
It's funny.

278
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:09,681
So I'm mature,

279
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:09,831
man.

280
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:13,400
He put a vagina at a woman's neck and
a woman who's running for Congress,

281
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,473
first of all,

282
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,830
it's unpatriotic.

283
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,170
Regardless whether or
not you agree with her,

284
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,400
you will respect her.

285
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,810
It's UNAMERICAN Brian.

286
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:21,771
Oh,

287
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:22,010
sorry.
