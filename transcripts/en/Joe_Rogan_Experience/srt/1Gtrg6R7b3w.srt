1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,530
Four three,

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,543
two,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,593
one.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:08,351
All right.

5
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:08,860
We live.

6
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,581
What's up man?

7
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:10,414
What's up dude?

8
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,860
What's hilarious folks?

9
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:12,694
I have to tell you this.

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,100
I did a podcast earlier today and he said,

11
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:15,271
wow,

12
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:16,600
it's your second for the day.

13
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:16,991
He goes,

14
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:18,460
impressive endurance.

15
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,270
Do you know how fucking
ridiculous that is for you to say,

16
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,420
this is a guy who walked
across an article.

17
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:26,280
How many days did it take you?

18
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,910
54 days by yourself.

19
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:32,590
By myself checking the
fucking frozen Tundra it,

20
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:34,030
that was an endurance feat of its own.

21
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:34,211
Yeah.

22
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:35,960
Just that's a real endurance feed.

23
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:37,480
I'm just sitting down talking to people.

24
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,561
Oh my God.

25
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:39,910
You talked already for two hours.

26
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:40,744
How do you do it?

27
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,281
Two more hours.

28
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:42,791
Here we go.

29
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:43,624
Yeah.

30
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,260
Yup,

31
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:44,680
Yup.

32
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,660
To what the fuck were you doing?

33
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,160
Just just getting back.

34
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:48,611
Actually.

35
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:48,971
Still,

36
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:49,420
uh,

37
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,100
still practically have
the snow on my shoes.

38
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:51,191
Yeah.

39
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:52,450
I got back about a month ago.

40
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:53,650
54 day journey.

41
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,590
First person in history to
cross the entire continent.

42
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:58,240
Solo unsupported.

43
00:00:58,241 --> 00:00:59,860
So no resupplies throughout the thing.

44
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:00,190
No,

45
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:00,761
no aid,

46
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:01,541
no wind kites,

47
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:01,841
nothing.

48
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:05,800
Just me dragging a 375 pound
sled across Antarctica.

49
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,710
I can't believe it only took you 54 days.

50
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,663
Yeah,

51
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,470
it's so big.

52
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,970
When you look at an article on a map,

53
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,910
like how long do you think it would
take you to walk across America?

54
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,140
Well you got,

55
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,720
so we usually look at Antarctica
to map this hilarious.

56
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:21,190
I have show people a
picture of Antarctica.

57
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:21,821
You're a smart guy.

58
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:22,350
You probably noticed,

59
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,690
but usually people see it on a map
projection because then it gets flat.

60
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,320
Right?

61
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,340
It's actually circular.

62
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,150
Um,

63
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,350
so I went from the edge of the raw and
I shelf to the Ra via the south pole to

64
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:33,220
the Ross ice shelf.

65
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:35,470
So basically kind of a diagonal across,

66
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,570
through the center and then
back to the other ice shelf.

67
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,440
What do the flat earthers think about?

68
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,770
You are traversing this,

69
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,633
this area.

70
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,810
This is what you did.

71
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:44,320
This is how you,

72
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,831
there it is.

73
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:45,341
Exactly.

74
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:45,610
Yes.

75
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,280
We went to the center of
the fucking earth basically.

76
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:48,890
There it is.

77
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,920
The top of the pole yet
bottom of the earth,

78
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,520
you know,

79
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,890
standing down there holding
everyone up on my shoulders.

80
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,221
Wow.

81
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:57,460
So you were at the South Pole
and then you trucked over to the,

82
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,170
to the ice shelf in their side.

83
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,020
It's funny you say about the flat
earthers though because all jokes aside,

84
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,920
I be getting a lot of trolling on my
Instagram page from the flat earthers I've

85
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:06,481
got guys go,

86
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,314
I'm like,

87
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,550
oh I was doing this speech the other day.

88
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,020
People are Super Nice.

89
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:13,100
Come up in the Q and a afterwards
I want to shake my hand,

90
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,660
take a picture,

91
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,290
whatever.

92
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,080
And this guy walks up and this real
earnest look on his face and he's like,

93
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,170
so I really wanted to ask
you how was the whole?

94
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,071
And I was like,

95
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:21,904
excuse me.

96
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,870
He was like,

97
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,360
he know the hole at the
center and I was like,

98
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,040
ah,

99
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,950
I can give me a little more.

100
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:27,371
He was like,

101
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:29,050
you know like when you got to the edge

102
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:31,990
and I was like,

103
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,591
Oh man,

104
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:35,080
like you're really asking
this question right now.

105
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:36,330
Like we are talking about this.

106
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,780
I didn't quite know where to go with it.

107
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:38,530
I was like,

108
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:38,970
yeah,

109
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,090
there was actually,

110
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,190
I at least I didn't see the edge and the
curvature kept going and I made such a

111
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:46,900
strange thing to believe,

112
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,400
but people do it.

113
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,740
People think people are
trolling about that.

114
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:51,250
And you know what?

115
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,360
It actually started out,

116
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:53,800
it's another four Chan thing,

117
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:54,340
you know?

118
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,140
Did you know that it's,

119
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:56,441
well,

120
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:58,510
I'm sure there was probably somebody
who believed it before that,

121
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,070
but it started people trolling on

122
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,980
four Chan and then eventually
people just started actually going,

123
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:03,580
hey,

124
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,500
you input it is flat.

125
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:07,720
And then they started
believing it and videos,

126
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,920
youtube videos popped up.

127
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,230
There's another youtube video of
someone linked to me the other day and I

128
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:11,771
thought it had like,

129
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:13,180
I thought it had like a few hundred views.

130
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:14,380
We had 28,000 views.

131
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:17,920
There was all these guys debating like
call and prove that there's not a wall.

132
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,791
The wall,

133
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,040
like there would be like game of
Thrones at the edge of the world.

134
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,540
There's this whole conversation.

135
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,670
I bet there's another 28,000 people.

136
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,680
It's proved to call and
never actually weren't.

137
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,533
Oh,

138
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,190
he's a new world order shill.

139
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:30,671
Well,

140
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:31,031
the other,

141
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:34,150
the other buddy wide was that we
got up budge on the Instagram page.

142
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,100
I'm out there alone completely by myself,

143
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:38,610
but I wanted to share the whole story
through my Instagram to like share that

144
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:39,520
journey with people,

145
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,260
inspire others to do
whatever they want to do.

146
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,880
And it kept being like,

147
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,560
what mean he's not out there alone.

148
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,790
He's taking pictures.

149
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,660
Was like the film crew as like guys,

150
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:52,600
have you never heard of a tripod?

151
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,210
And if in a timer,

152
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,450
uh,

153
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,460
watched survivor man.

154
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,001
Exactly.

155
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:58,451
So it's so,

156
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:58,931
it's so funny.

157
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:00,190
Comments along those lines.

158
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:00,660
So your,

159
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,950
your sled was 300 and how many pounds?

160
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,600
375 pounds of start.

161
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,740
So basically,

162
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,370
uh,

163
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,720
food and fuel was the main,

164
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:08,261
the main way.

165
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:08,681
So people,

166
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,480
I called my project the impossible first.

167
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:13,840
That's sort of what I named the project
because several people would try it

168
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:14,674
right there.

169
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,600
So not only walking,

170
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:19,870
you're dragging this big ass heavy sled.

171
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,590
Yeah,

172
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:20,890
yeah.

173
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,730
And Dude,

174
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,690
people.

175
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,890
So people have tried this,

176
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,101
uh,

177
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:24,311
you know,

178
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:27,730
going back a hundred years to sh Ernest
Shackleton saying if it was possible.

179
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:28,930
And then the last few years,

180
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:31,630
some really experienced polar explorers
have given it a shot and one guy

181
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:34,610
actually died less than a hundred
miles from the finish shine.

182
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,020
Um,

183
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,950
because of lack of nutrition and some
challenges with the weather and things

184
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:39,780
like that.

185
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,390
Um,

186
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,470
but people called it,

187
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:41,621
you know,

188
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:42,191
people after that,

189
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:42,430
we're like,

190
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,181
it's impossible.

191
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:46,480
And the reason people thought it
was impossible because you can't get

192
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:47,111
resupplies,

193
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,540
meaning if you feel your sled
with food and a certain amount,

194
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,190
you actually can't drag this led anymore.

195
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,970
So the whole math equation really was
figuring out just how much food and fuel I

196
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:55,721
could put in the sled.

197
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,250
The fuel melts the water,

198
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:59,170
so melts the ice into water essentially,

199
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,780
and that equal to 375 pounds.

200
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:02,530
And to be truth,

201
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,810
I could barely pull it on the first day.

202
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:07,850
Like I a one hour into
getting dropped off.

203
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,030
I'm dropped off completely
alone out there in Antarctica.

204
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,650
I planned this project for a year,

205
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:12,300
you know,

206
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:12,730
uh,

207
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,451
and uh,

208
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:17,260
I get dropped off and after about one
hour pulling 375 pound sled through the

209
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:17,591
snow,

210
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:19,270
it's minus 25 degrees out.

211
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,701
I'm crying,

212
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:20,321
I'm crying,

213
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:23,950
I'm literally crying and the tears
in my goggles are starting to freeze.

214
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:24,340
And I'm like,

215
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,941
oh my God.

216
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:26,080
So I pick up my satellite phone,

217
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,250
I call home to my wife Jenna,

218
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:30,190
who also creates and plans
all these projects with me.

219
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,293
And I'm like,

220
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,950
Babe,

221
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,230
uh,

222
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,150
I think we named the
project the right thing.

223
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,111
The impossible verse.

224
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:35,790
Yep.

225
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,470
It looks like it might be
impossible to keep going.

226
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,140
So I'm one hour into a
thousand mile journey.

227
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,200
Poetess sled told everyone I'm going
to do this and I'm already having those

228
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,040
doubts pull up.

229
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,231
Uh,

230
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:45,431
you know,

231
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:49,330
fortunately I was able to get a little
bit further that day and 54 days later

232
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:50,141
and made it to the end.

233
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,640
But how far did you get in the first day?

234
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,181
Well,

235
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:53,170
it's funny cause we show,

236
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:53,951
just show the map.

237
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:54,580
I actually,

238
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:54,721
you know,

239
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,690
it starts on the ice shelf,

240
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,310
which is basically the frozen sea
ice and there's an edge of that.

241
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,780
That's where the continent starts.

242
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,420
And so I have a waypoint
on my gps that marks that.

243
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:05,540
So the plane that drops me off actually
dropped me off on the ice shelf before

244
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,490
the continent starts.

245
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,990
And my first way point was
kind of like the actual start.

246
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,580
And so one hour in,

247
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:12,230
I haven't even hit the real start.

248
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:12,701
So when she,

249
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:13,700
when I call her on the phone,

250
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,450
she's like,

251
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,201
cause she knows the route.

252
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:15,531
And she was like,

253
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:17,480
well how far are you
from the first way point,

254
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,260
which is where the actual start.

255
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,120
And I'm like,

256
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,830
it's 0.63 more miles.

257
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,530
She's like,

258
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,580
it's half a mile.

259
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,570
You have a thousand more to go.

260
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:27,920
Like get to the first way point,

261
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,763
you know?

262
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,331
And I was like,

263
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:29,691
okay,

264
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:30,021
okay.

265
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:30,670
So I,

266
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:30,890
you know,

267
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,641
rallied myself,

268
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,730
got to the first way point and then
finally got in my tent that night and just

269
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:35,600
kind of took a deep breath.

270
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,940
I think I was just overwhelmed
by the magnitude of it.

271
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:38,121
I mean,

272
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:41,120
imagine being a speck in the
middle of Antarctica alone,

273
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,680
these crazy temperatures,

274
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:42,861
you know,

275
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,320
all the excitement but
fears of the journey ahead.

276
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,220
Um,

277
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,830
and 375 pounds on my back when the sleds,

278
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,460
when the snow's deep too
loose snow makes 375 pounds,

279
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,500
even even heavier than if it's like light,

280
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:54,800
you know,

281
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,300
icier consolidated.

282
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,170
So yeah,

283
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:57,381
it was,

284
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:59,120
it was a rough start to say the least.

285
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,480
Did you do any sort of test run
pulling the sled anywhere else?

286
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,231
Yeah,

287
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:05,330
so the training element
of it was pretty cool.

288
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:05,900
So,

289
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,560
um,

290
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,041
this was,

291
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,400
I actually said a few other world records
previous to this and the mountains and

292
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:11,840
things we could talk about if you want.

293
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:12,231
But the,

294
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:12,800
uh,

295
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,200
the last year I really
committed to this project,

296
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,034
I,

297
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,361
um,

298
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:19,700
yet decided to obviously start
training specifically for this.

299
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,080
Um,

300
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,010
I needed to put on about
20 pounds of muscle.

301
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:23,690
I'm usually six foot one 65.

302
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:24,201
Pretty Lean.

303
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:27,170
I'd race triathlon professionally for a
number of years and realized I needed to

304
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:29,480
be a bit bigger because I was
going to lose so much weight.

305
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,590
Um,

306
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,960
and I found an amazing coach in Portland,

307
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:33,800
Oregon where I live.

308
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,210
This guy named Mike McCastle.

309
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:36,290
I don't know if you've ever heard of him,

310
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,124
but I know you've had,

311
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,460
you've had David Goggins on your show.

312
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,320
I take it.

313
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,831
So,

314
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:40,520
um,

315
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,820
Mike actually surpassed
David's pullup record.

316
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:48,170
Mike did 5,804 pull ups in 20 hours.

317
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,801
Um,

318
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,540
I think Goggins at about 4,000,

319
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,570
which are both insane to me because
I can do like another thousand.

320
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,380
And he was,

321
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,940
Mike was wearing a 30 pound weight.

322
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:56,774
[inaudible]

323
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,703
yes.

324
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,480
Just to add insult to injury,

325
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,200
uh,

326
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,470
Mike McCastle absolute absolute legends.

327
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:02,870
So anyways,

328
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,171
a minute,

329
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:04,004
wait a minute.

330
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,000
5,000 fucking Chin ups
with a weight vest on,

331
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,740
dude that barely can do 10 love.

332
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,130
I'm right there with you
at like pull ups are not.

333
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,050
I've got some other physical strikes,

334
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:16,820
but the pullup department is not,

335
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:19,230
not my strong suit is fucking insane.

336
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,113
Get this too.

337
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,050
Just cause I got to,

338
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,520
I got a big up my band for a second.

339
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,600
That's his fourth world right here.

340
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:26,480
Also pulled a f two 50 truck,

341
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:28,700
20 miles across death valley.

342
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,923
Uh,

343
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,100
in a harness.

344
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,460
So I'm trying to look for the best guy
to teach me how to pull heavy Shang.

345
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,090
My God,

346
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:35,990
you got the guy,

347
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,870
I found the guy,

348
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:37,191
I was like,

349
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:38,150
fuck,

350
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,270
this is the guy out.

351
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,430
Does it just make you
feel like such a pussy?

352
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,880
And the greatest thing about Mike,

353
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:47,240
you know,

354
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,541
big,

355
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,650
strong jacked dude,

356
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:50,180
but like super soft spoken.

357
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:50,750
She's like,

358
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:50,991
he's like,

359
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:51,340
yeah,

360
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,250
I did this pope's.

361
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,150
So it was cool.

362
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,660
Like,

363
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,500
so anyways,

364
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,720
I basically

365
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,310
fucked with that record so hard he could
die and like come back to life and live

366
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:04,650
a whole nother live and no
one's ever going to do it.

367
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,100
Yeah.

368
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,701
So anyways,

369
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:06,271
my training,

370
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:06,520
he would,

371
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,540
he was the guy went to him train
out of this gym in Portland,

372
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,590
uh,

373
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:10,801
where,

374
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,300
where he trains out of and he just,

375
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,170
he got me bigger,

376
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:14,040
he got me stronger.

377
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,860
But he also did all sorts
of bad ass crazy stuff.

378
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:18,300
I mean there's a physical challenge,

379
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:20,010
but it's more of a mental
challenge in anything.

380
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:20,850
So he had me,

381
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,361
you know,

382
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,830
my hands in ice buckets,

383
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:25,470
doing planks to get my heart rate
jacked up and then he'd be like,

384
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:26,310
get out of the water.

385
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,260
Then I pulled my hands
out of the ice buckets.

386
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:31,110
Do you not be a seated
squat against the wall?

387
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,500
But then he would hand me Legos
and so my hands are frozen.

388
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,210
My feet are in ice buckets now in a plank.

389
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:36,811
My heart rates,

390
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:36,991
you know,

391
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:38,430
one 90 and he's like,

392
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,780
put this Lego set together.

393
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:41,790
So the deck dexterity in my fingers,

394
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,830
the mental acuity to
pull this all together.

395
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,300
There is this guy,

396
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,550
what a fucking savage this guy is.

397
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,070
He and he did that for veteran suicides.

398
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:50,460
Yeah,

399
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,061
exactly.

400
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:51,511
So he did,

401
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:52,500
he's got really,

402
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:54,480
really important missions
behind all of his projects.

403
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:56,520
He calls him 12 labors in over his life.

404
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:59,280
He's trying to set 12 route
world records and various things.

405
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,200
People that are just,

406
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,090
they're just designed different.

407
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,720
Yeah.

408
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,140
Yeah.

409
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,220
So he's the man.

410
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:07,290
But like this crazy
training he came up with,

411
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,240
for me that was like the ice,

412
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,230
the water,

413
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:11,400
the mental acuity.

414
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:12,660
All of this was like,

415
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:13,021
he was like,

416
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:13,350
Yo,

417
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,050
you're going to be in Antarctica
if your tent blows away,

418
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:16,980
when you're pulling it up,

419
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:17,700
you're dead.

420
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,590
Like the stakes are that high 50,

421
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:23,040
60 mile per hour winds
like absolutely crazy.

422
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,610
Um,

423
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,760
so should we ever have an issue like that
where you thought the could blow away?

424
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,540
Um,

425
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:27,960
I think,

426
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,040
I don't know if you have it.

427
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,120
There's a clip on my Instagram.

428
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:34,470
I posted a few days ago of me of me
setting up the tent in a minus 80 degrees

429
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,333
out,

430
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,990
60 mile per hour winds.

431
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:37,980
Um,

432
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,330
it's pretty gnarly,

433
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,811
but yeah,

434
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:42,630
I mean there was one time when the
10 almost did blow away from me yet.

435
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,261
There's this one,

436
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:44,130
there's one other one.

437
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,030
This is me getting into looking
like an absolute disaster.

438
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:48,151
What?

439
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,320
I get help with audio,

440
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:50,280
but that's me.

441
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,713
That's me.

442
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,081
Whoa.

443
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:03,081
You're pulling eyesight got caught on a
massive storm and I was just so hard to

444
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:06,361
get the tent up.

445
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,280
I didn't know if I was gonna be able to
get it up where I was going to have to

446
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:09,270
just keep walking.

447
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,563
Now,

448
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,080
hopefully these tent poles hold,

449
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,713
man,

450
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,930
that was really intense.

451
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,310
How do you stay warm in that tent?

452
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,250
So it average temperature
is about minus 25 minus 30.

453
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:29,581
Uh,

454
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,370
and Antarctica,

455
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:30,841
like I said,

456
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:31,920
when the wind jacks up,

457
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,371
uh,

458
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:34,140
I don't know if there's the other
cup of me setting up the tip,

459
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:35,670
but if you get a chance to see that it's,

460
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,750
you know,

461
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,640
it's about Kimmy about minus 80 outside,

462
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,920
which it's hard to wrap
your mind around that.

463
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:44,280
But I've tried to put it in perspective
by saying I could take a cup of boiling

464
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,290
water and throw it in an air
and immediately turns to ice.

465
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:46,820
Like that's,

466
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,190
that's,

467
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,750
that's the temperature would dealing with,

468
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,201
yeah.

469
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:50,410
This is me trying to,

470
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:51,090
uh,

471
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,170
keep the tent poles together.

472
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,800
Usually you have someone
else to hold onto it,

473
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:54,371
but I'm alone.

474
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:56,290
I'm completely alone out there.

475
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,080
So this is me struggling with my tent,

476
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,310
just trying to keep it up.

477
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:02,140
I've got it tied down to my sled.

478
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,410
They're just battling battling
the winds and the state.

479
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:05,831
Like I said,

480
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:06,461
the stakes are high.

481
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,031
If that blows away,

482
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:07,900
I don't have a spare 10.

483
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,810
I've got no extra weight in
my sled to hold spare stuff.

484
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,980
So it's,

485
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,281
it's,

486
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:16,180
it's do or die quite literally in a
moment like that have a patch kit.

487
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,890
I had a couple of things repaired,

488
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:18,701
his sewing kit,

489
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:19,331
a patch kit,

490
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:19,931
stuff like that.

491
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:21,730
But if the tent itself or the temples,

492
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,593
you know,

493
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,970
pretty much done.

494
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:29,971
And also you have to set up your tripod
and film and then press stop and go back

495
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:30,650
and send it.

496
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,470
How are you keeping these
batteries juiced up?

497
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:32,911
No,

498
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:33,161
this is,

499
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:36,370
this is the film crew man
that was following me around
that right of the plateau

500
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,590
film group there near the Ice Wall.

501
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,310
The uh,

502
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:39,810
no,

503
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,420
uh,

504
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,360
it was basically that had to keep the
batteries warm by keeping them right

505
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:44,200
against my skin.

506
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,230
So I keep the batteries right against
my skin and my body weight would keep it

507
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,860
warm.

508
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,150
And the second I wanted to take it out,

509
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,710
I pulled out real quick hit play.

510
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,520
And then it would usually last a minute
or 30 enough to get a little clip or

511
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:55,151
something like that.

512
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:55,990
You couldn't just let it run,

513
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,330
but then it would completely freeze.

514
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,020
Even a full battery would be on zero
battery by pretty quickly using solar

515
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:03,100
panels to charge it.

516
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:03,521
Yeah.

517
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:07,270
So one crazy cool thing about Antarctica
and that time of year is it's 24 hours

518
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:07,840
a day light.

519
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,130
And so the sun never sets.

520
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:10,780
So even when I'm on my tent
in the middle of the night,

521
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,500
I'm asking your plugs to kind
of pretend like it's nighttime,

522
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,370
but 24 hours a day light.

523
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:16,480
So solar panels,

524
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,040
I'm keeping everything charged.

525
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:18,880
Camera's phone,

526
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,361
batteries,

527
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:19,890
all that.

528
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,730
And Are you traveling
with or are you using gps?

529
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,661
Yeah,

530
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:26,220
so I had some way points.

531
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,310
The GPS waypoints that kind of
led my path to the South Pole,

532
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:29,791
et cetera.

533
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,200
But most actually using a compass.

534
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:34,770
So I look at my gps maybe once
every week or something like that.

535
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:35,730
Just cause the bearing,

536
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,380
the juice factor,

537
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,840
it's actually just easier because,

538
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:42,750
so I basically had like a harness on
front of me that would have my gps or my

539
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,010
compass kind of off my chest more or
less because some of the clips we saw the

540
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:47,551
sun's out.

541
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:49,950
But actually more than half of
the time the clouds would come in.

542
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,840
So it'd be just complete
and utter whiteout.

543
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,940
I couldn't even see one
step in front of me.

544
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,930
And so I'd actually have to
just stare down at my compass,

545
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
keep it on this bearing.

546
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:00,120
And so imagine you can't see anything,

547
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:01,470
can't see one step in front of you.

548
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,030
I'm pulling it,

549
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,280
you know,

550
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,360
300 pound sled,

551
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:05,010
1213 hours per day,

552
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,810
not listening to anything really complete
dead silence and just staring at this

553
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:11,190
compass bearing all day long.

554
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:12,024
So

555
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,660
going crazy at all.

556
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,980
I mean,

557
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,850
the mental side of it was by far the
most interesting side of it for me.

558
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,200
Um,

559
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,391
you know,

560
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:23,040
have a lifelong endurance athlete,

561
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,340
but really kind of an exploration into
the mind is what it was for me and why I

562
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:27,390
was curious about it.

563
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,190
So spending all this time in silence.

564
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:29,760
I've done,

565
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,600
are you familiar with,

566
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:31,020
uh,

567
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,730
a vipassana meditation,

568
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,593
these tips?

569
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,440
So I've done a couple of these 10 days
silent meditation retreats before this,

570
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:38,340
which is 10 days,

571
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:39,031
no reading,

572
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:39,810
no writing,

573
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,860
no eye contact,

574
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,790
um,

575
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,590
kind of dove into that piece of it.

576
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,310
But 54 days alone in Antarctica
and complete silence was,

577
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:49,440
was next level of that for sure.

578
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,611
Damn.

579
00:14:50,611 --> 00:14:50,851
Dude,

580
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:52,670
that is so fucking

581
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:53,710
impressive.

582
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,543
I

583
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,750
can't believe that you did that.

584
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,710
Now when you're looking down and it's
an utter whiteout and you're looking at

585
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:03,680
your compass and you're
dragging this shit behind you,

586
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,783
like,

587
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,220
are you doing anything in your mind?

588
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,230
Are you like singing songs?

589
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,083
Are you,

590
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:10,860
what are you doing?

591
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,693
Um,

592
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,290
there's a couple of different things,

593
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,320
but really what ended up happening is I
started to be able to trigger these flow

594
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:16,771
states.

595
00:15:16,771 --> 00:15:17,604
So,

596
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,391
you know,

597
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:22,530
as a lifelong professional athlete
through different capacities in my life.

598
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:22,771
You know,

599
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:23,591
I've tapped into that.

600
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:23,720
You know,

601
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,290
I was a swimmer when I was a little kid,

602
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,430
so swimming laps in a pool.

603
00:15:26,431 --> 00:15:30,090
Sometimes I would like kind of just happen
to this like timeless space where you

604
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:30,151
know,

605
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:33,480
maybe 30 minutes would go by and in
two minutes or something like that.

606
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:35,040
But I never really knew how I got there.

607
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,510
Just so it's sometimes tap into it,

608
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:37,261
sometimes not,

609
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:37,471
you know,

610
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,191
the zone flow,

611
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:38,401
state,

612
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:39,420
whatever you want to call that.

613
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,860
But in Antarctica I went in with this
sort of a tension about intention of

614
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,600
exploring that space in my mind.

615
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,990
And so as I got more and more into
these wideouts into these compass,

616
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,400
staring at this compass,

617
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:52,080
staring at this expansive landscape,

618
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,650
I started to find ways to actually
trigger that flow state in my mind.

619
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,070
So it got to the point where I
could for several days at a time,

620
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:00,390
be in this deep flow state.

621
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:01,230
So you know,

622
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:03,990
my day was about 17 hours
every day between getting up,

623
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:04,801
boiling my water,

624
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:05,640
getting out of my tent,

625
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:06,600
and those crazy conditions,

626
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:07,650
packing my sled,

627
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,940
dragging it for 13 hours,

628
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:10,560
setting my tent back up and these storms.

629
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,220
But I got into this sort of sequence
of being so present with each step,

630
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,390
each next sequence that it ended up
being in this really timeless spaceless

631
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:23,391
place in my mind of true high performance
that was almost like the most deepest,

632
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,121
peaceful,

633
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:26,160
meditative state that
I can possibly imagine.

634
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:26,401
It was.

635
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:28,020
It was very profound and beautiful,

636
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,270
uh,

637
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,310
to get there in my mind.

638
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,293
Wow.

639
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,480
Are you boiling this water in your tent?

640
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,363
Like,

641
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:34,710
yeah,

642
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,543
so my 10,

643
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,241
yeah.

644
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:37,021
So it kind of a,

645
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:39,310
a slightly different
white gas fuels stove.

646
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,830
So not the canisters where
you could throw away,

647
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:42,450
but like gas that you
could refill the stove,

648
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:44,220
but his stove with fuel.

649
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:44,520
Um,

650
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,720
basically the way my tent was,

651
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:47,310
you saw the outer layer of the tent there.

652
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:51,300
There's actually an inner part that's a
tent so that there's a vestibule where

653
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,030
basically there's snow inside
the doorway but not outside,

654
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:54,481
outside.

655
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:57,000
So I would shovel that snow
from inside of the tent,

656
00:16:57,001 --> 00:17:00,570
vestibule into my pot and be
able to melt the water that way.

657
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,021
Um,

658
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,320
and drank about six liters
of water every single day.

659
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,490
Um,

660
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,323
when I was out there.

661
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,070
It's a lot of snow,

662
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:08,641
a lot of antiques,

663
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:09,600
a few hours to melt that.

664
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:12,840
But people don't realize this in order
cause actually the largest desert in the

665
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:13,350
world.

666
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,860
Um,

667
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,240
so it's actually very dry.

668
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:16,620
It doesn't snow very often.

669
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:18,210
But when it does of course never melt.

670
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:20,490
And the South Pole was at 9,300 feet.

671
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:24,270
So not only am I in this desert but
I'm at altitude doing this thing.

672
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,143
So

673
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,650
did you train it out to two?

674
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:33,650
Did use like one of those
tents to sleep in or,

675
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,061
yeah,

676
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:36,520
so there's this gym that
Mike and I train out of,

677
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:37,241
it's called evolution,

678
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:38,680
healthcare and fitness in Portland.

679
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,340
They actually have an altitude room
there so that it's not even a tent,

680
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:43,390
but they actually have a full,

681
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,040
a full room where you can,

682
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,560
you know,

683
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,450
got rowing machines.

684
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:47,290
It's got treadmills.

685
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,090
It's got all that
simulated up to about 14.

686
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,303
How big is the room?

687
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,890
It's about 400 square feet.

688
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,580
High ceilings,

689
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:53,881
big.

690
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,770
I mean it's not like huge big enough.

691
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:55,911
Yeah,

692
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:56,850
it's like a proper room.

693
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:59,970
I've been in some of those tents before
when I was racing triathlon many years

694
00:17:59,970 --> 00:17:59,971
ago,

695
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:01,590
a lot of people were starting
to sleep in those tents,

696
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,700
but black people have a hard time and
then they get warm and stuff like that and

697
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:06,240
a lot fighters use them as well.

698
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,080
Um,

699
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,040
but uh,

700
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,431
but yeah,

701
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:10,320
it was pretty cool to have a
full room that you can actually,

702
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:10,680
you know,

703
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,060
be in and move in properly,

704
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,630
um,

705
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,781
for,

706
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:14,490
to stimulate some of the
high intensity stuff.

707
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:14,880
Yeah.

708
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,060
And so it would take you hours
every day to make your water?

709
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:18,781
Yeah,

710
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,670
I would say I was boiling
water for about three,

711
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,600
four hours per day.

712
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,800
So about hour or two in the morning,

713
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,150
hour or two in the evening.

714
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,480
Uh,

715
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,680
it takes a lot of energy to boil,

716
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:25,861
you know,

717
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:28,230
frozen snow when it's that cold out.

718
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:28,580
Um,

719
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,070
so you had to care.

720
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,090
I had to carry a lot of fuel.

721
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:32,300
That was the other really
heavy component in the sled.

722
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,950
Hundreds of hours of fuel.

723
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,350
Yeah.

724
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,390
So I took about,

725
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,373
uh,

726
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,270
17 liters of fuel,

727
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:39,871
so that's what I have,

728
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,250
six gallons or something like that.

729
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,830
How'd you know that that
was going to be enough?

730
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,001
Uh,

731
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,680
I did some practicing beforehand.

732
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,490
Um,

733
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,330
I,

734
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:48,751
I,

735
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:53,280
in 2016 I did another world record project
where I climbed the tallest mountain

736
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:54,540
on each of the seven continents,

737
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,850
the seven summits as well as
went to the north and South Pole,

738
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:58,950
but much smaller polar expeditions a week,

739
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,280
uh,

740
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,290
basically across crossing
the last degree of latitude.

741
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,960
And so when those expeditions
off those on Everest,

742
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:04,610
during that time,

743
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,040
Denali,

744
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,440
etc. All of that in 139 days.

745
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,100
Um,

746
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,310
but I did that and that kind
of helped me get a sense of it.

747
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:14,490
But honestly it was also best
guess based on talking to people,

748
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:15,930
different experts in the field,

749
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:16,410
you know,

750
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,310
diving into that.

751
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:19,320
But you never know is it going
to be enough or too little?

752
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:20,880
I'm here on the side of too much.

753
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,783
When,

754
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,340
when you finally got to the end,

755
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:24,300
how much did you have left?

756
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,680
So my final push,

757
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:26,101
I actually,

758
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:31,101
I woke up on the morning of Christmas Eve
24th of December this past year and it

759
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:31,500
looked,

760
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,630
I was 77 miles from the finish.

761
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,880
And I had been going at that point,

762
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:36,601
at the beginning of the trip,

763
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:37,470
I was only going nine,

764
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:38,370
10 miles per day.

765
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,971
Towards the end,

766
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,200
I started going about 20,

767
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:41,160
25 miles per day.

768
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,551
So I said,

769
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:42,180
you know what,

770
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,410
I'm about three days out.

771
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,240
And then I thought to myself,

772
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:47,580
maybe if I could push really
hard these next two days,

773
00:19:47,581 --> 00:19:48,450
I could do it in two days,

774
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:50,430
like two 15 plus hour days.

775
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:54,990
Like really get into it and started
looking at my fuel and food supplies and

776
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:56,010
like they were pretty low.

777
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:56,320
I had,

778
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,131
I had enough fuel,

779
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:57,391
a few,

780
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:58,590
a few liters of fuel,

781
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,450
but I actually want to had
about a day or two of food,

782
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,490
like real substantial food left.

783
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,270
Um,

784
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,460
and so I woke up and I was like,

785
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:05,791
all right,

786
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:06,660
let's go for this.

787
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,540
And in the actually deepest
talk about flow states,

788
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,460
that was the deepest
flow state of my life.

789
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,710
I woke up in one hour and that
day it's Christmas morning.

790
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:16,950
Now I wake up and I'm just
locked in and I just came.

791
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:18,600
I didn't tell anyone back home,

792
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,130
didn't tell my wife who was tracking me.

793
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,930
They had this gps tracker
where they could follow me,

794
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:22,770
but I was just in my mind,

795
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:23,520
I was like,

796
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,970
you know what,

797
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,080
not not three days,

798
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:25,771
not two days.

799
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,270
I'm going straight for it.

800
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,570
And so I did a final 32 hour continuous
push on day 54 77 miles straight,

801
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:37,980
drag of my sled all the way to get to
the finish line in one continuous push.

802
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:38,641
No music,

803
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:39,241
no nothing.

804
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:40,830
Just like in my head in this,

805
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,760
in this crazy flow state of,

806
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,130
I dunno,

807
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,090
high performance.

808
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,020
Um,

809
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,411
and it was,

810
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:46,860
it was,

811
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,700
it was a crazy final push to get there,

812
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:51,130
but made it right before
the food and fuel ran out.

813
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,063
Oh my God.

814
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,280
And then there's,

815
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,660
there's no one there of course,

816
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,040
like you crossed the finish side.

817
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:57,281
You're like,

818
00:20:57,281 --> 00:20:57,640
done this.

819
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,080
No one in the world has ever done this.

820
00:20:59,081 --> 00:20:59,560
Applause.

821
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,393
Nope.

822
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,360
Zero.

823
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,220
And so what do you do
when you get to the end?

824
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:03,971
You said,

825
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:04,211
hey,

826
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:04,721
I'm done.

827
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,410
Come get me.

828
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:05,931
Yeah.

829
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,190
Yeah.

830
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,780
How long does it take
for them to come get you?

831
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,000
It took me a week to
get out of Antarctica.

832
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:10,451
Totally.

833
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:13,440
It took actually me four days to get a,

834
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,120
but there was a crazy
other component to this,

835
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,880
which is no one in the world
had ever done this before.

836
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:19,361
And like I said,

837
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,400
a few really talented people,

838
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:23,620
some of the best explorers in
the world had tried recently.

839
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:24,490
One guy died.

840
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,360
Um,

841
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,390
and it just so happened there's a really
specific season where you can attempt

842
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:28,691
this.

843
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:31,810
But another guy was attempting
this at the exact same time as me.

844
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,070
I'm a British,

845
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,800
a British guy who's a
equivalent of a navy seal,

846
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,041
you know,

847
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,420
British special forces.

848
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,340
The living most experienced
guy in Antarctica is actually
pulled 3000 plus miles

849
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:44,320
and an article now on various expeditions.

850
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,000
And so we got dropped off one mile away
from each other to begin this thing.

851
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,900
And um,

852
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,490
obviously I was the first,

853
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:55,450
I did win this race head to head and at
the finish line I waited for him for a

854
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,030
few days cause I wanted to congratulate
him cause he did ultimately finish.

855
00:21:58,031 --> 00:21:59,020
But you can only imagine.

856
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,420
I would feel going back to that
first hour where I was like,

857
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,170
it's impossible.

858
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:02,830
It was also like,

859
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,000
it's impossible and bow the,

860
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:04,571
by the way,

861
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:07,180
this navy seal dude who knows
more about Antarctica to me,

862
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,253
he's often going,

863
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,710
I can see him at a distance just
like leaving me in the dust.

864
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,430
Um,

865
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,500
but fortunately after day
six I caught up to him,

866
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,370
you know,

867
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,790
I waved to him and this weird
like passing of the torch moment,

868
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:22,030
like I was passing him and then I never
saw him again till I finished and I

869
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:23,890
finished about 70 miles ahead of him,

870
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:25,030
about two and a half days ahead of them.

871
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,950
That's got to suck for him.

872
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,220
Or I got this mother Fucker,

873
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,840
I brought it home for America,

874
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:32,141
man,

875
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:32,870
you know,

876
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,551
appreciate that.

877
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:33,981
We all,

878
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:35,140
we all appreciate that,

879
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,071
but still,

880
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:37,180
that's going suck for him.

881
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,541
Yeah.

882
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,800
So I actually,

883
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:41,860
even though I finished and the first
thing I could have kind of wanted to do,

884
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:42,370
I haven't had,

885
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,330
I haven't had a shower.

886
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,230
I haven't,

887
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,040
I actually to save weight so I
could get as much food and fuel.

888
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,770
My sled,

889
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,760
I brought no extra clothes,

890
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:49,810
no extra pair of underwear,

891
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,430
like literally no extra pair of underwear.

892
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,410
I don't have to paradise.

893
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,820
So where are you shitting out there?

894
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,440
Everyone wants to know this.

895
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,580
Let's just get it on the table.

896
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:57,880
I let,

897
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,750
thank you for asking.

898
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,063
Um,

899
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,660
I basically,

900
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:03,940
I described that vestibule situation.

901
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:05,270
So one side I cook in,

902
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,130
right?

903
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,150
If the wind is calm,

904
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:07,990
I get out of my tent,

905
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:09,340
dig a hole and you know,

906
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,840
go shit and a whole basically.

907
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,250
But when it's real windy,

908
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:12,881
like those storms,

909
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:14,710
I just watched like you're going
to get frostbite if you try to,

910
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:14,980
you know,

911
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,491
bend over,

912
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:17,290
pull your pants down
when it's minus 80 out.

913
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,760
So in the vest if you will,

914
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:19,320
of my tent,

915
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,500
not the side I'm cooking on,

916
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,810
but the other side where
I'm still inside covered,

917
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:25,420
I dig a hole in there and
that was my morning routine.

918
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:26,320
Get up at 6:00 AM,

919
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,770
start boiling my water on one side
of my tent and it's not glamorous.

920
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:31,150
It's not a pretty thing.

921
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,050
And to make up,

922
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:32,801
actually to me,

923
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:34,750
this is very cool but also not glamorous.

924
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,380
Um,

925
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,900
within one degree of
latitude of the south pole.

926
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:41,200
So the last degree of ladders at 89
degrees to south pole at 90 degrees.

927
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:45,380
It's basically 69 miles or 60 nautical
miles circumference around the South Pole

928
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,080
and article being as pristine as it is,

929
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:50,420
they have all these laws about
environmental conservation,

930
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:51,500
which to me is amazing.

931
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,660
Being someone who just loves and
has a great steward of the land,

932
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,920
they actually say you can't even leave
your human waste in holes here even

933
00:23:57,921 --> 00:23:58,880
though there's nobody out there.

934
00:23:58,881 --> 00:23:59,181
They're like,

935
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:01,430
we want this to be
completely protected area.

936
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,530
And so yes,

937
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:06,680
usually my sled was getting lighter
most of the time cause I was eating food

938
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:07,790
everyday and burning fuel.

939
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,370
But in that last degree of latitude
to the south pole and crossing it,

940
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,600
I was shitting in a bag,

941
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,890
wrapping it up and putting it in my
sled and having to carry it with me.

942
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,570
So um,

943
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:17,870
yeah.

944
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,670
Wow.

945
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,840
It shows disciplines

946
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,870
should I was something a lot
of people have been like,

947
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:24,441
hey yeah,

948
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:25,274
I put it in a bag.

949
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,070
Fuck you crazy asshole.

950
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,870
Who cares if I dig a shit up there.

951
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,701
It was tempting,

952
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:33,061
but you know,

953
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:35,370
so I grew up in the gold
out in the outdoors.

954
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:37,080
It just as leave no
trace principles that I,

955
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:37,291
you know,

956
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:37,981
I really love.

957
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:39,260
And in particularly in article,

958
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:40,470
one of the things about Antarctica,

959
00:24:40,471 --> 00:24:43,800
it's one of those places where imagine
you've traveled far and wide and your

960
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:44,970
life and there's some few places,

961
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:46,890
at least in my mind where you just,

962
00:24:46,891 --> 00:24:49,420
you can't put it into words
until you've stepped off there.

963
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,041
And for me,

964
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,620
this is my second time in an article.

965
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,493
Both times,

966
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:52,711
you know,

967
00:24:52,711 --> 00:24:54,900
this big cargo ship basically
lands you on the continent.

968
00:24:54,901 --> 00:24:57,360
Then you get an a smaller plane to get
dropped off to where I needed to start on

969
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:58,111
the edge of the continent.

970
00:24:58,111 --> 00:25:00,420
But both times stepping off the plane,

971
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,650
I'm just shit eating grin ear to ear
on my face because I just am like,

972
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,341
Whoa,

973
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:06,360
what is this place?

974
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,590
Even the second time seeing it,

975
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:08,101
I felt that I'd like,

976
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:10,860
my cheeks were sore
because I was just smiling.

977
00:25:10,861 --> 00:25:13,470
So big of just pristine beauty.

978
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,970
The blank canvas.

979
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:15,151
The,

980
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:15,451
I mean,

981
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:16,650
you look out on the land and you're like,

982
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,070
human footprints haven't
touched 98% of the continents,

983
00:25:20,071 --> 00:25:20,671
something like that.

984
00:25:20,671 --> 00:25:21,870
I mean it's untouched.

985
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,610
And so shitting in a bag,

986
00:25:23,611 --> 00:25:27,450
if I had to do that to do
my part to keep it that way,

987
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,200
uh,

988
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,000
I did you drag?

989
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,900
Uh,

990
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,400
at the end it was about three.

991
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,490
I reuse the bag.

992
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:34,324
So

993
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,430
one per day for that section
is about hundred 20 miles.

994
00:25:38,431 --> 00:25:38,761
It took me,

995
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:39,240
I don't know,

996
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,740
a week or so to cover that distance.

997
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:41,390
So,

998
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:41,910
um,

999
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,100
yeah,

1000
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,420
added,

1001
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,700
added weight to my sled rather
than subtracting during.

1002
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:47,640
That was the middle part of the journey
right around the 30th and 40th day.

1003
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,620
Now how did you calculate your nutrition?

1004
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,420
The nutrition journey was actually
fascinating and to be honest,

1005
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,201
in my opinion,

1006
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:55,561
people said,

1007
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:55,930
well,

1008
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,330
how come other people die trying?

1009
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:58,950
Or why did other people
not be able to do it?

1010
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:00,330
Because one other guy ran out of food.

1011
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,490
And so when I was looking at this journey,

1012
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:02,701
you know,

1013
00:26:02,701 --> 00:26:02,821
we,

1014
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:03,050
again,

1015
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,530
we were calling it the impossible first.

1016
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:04,681
Like,

1017
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:06,900
how am I going to make
the impossible possible?

1018
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,780
And I thought that the nutrition
piece of it was going to be huge.

1019
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:10,614
I actually,

1020
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,690
my dad's an organic farmer in Hawaii,

1021
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:15,960
like whole food health and nutrition has
been a big part of my personal journey.

1022
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,390
And so I found a company that
was really in it with me.

1023
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:22,020
So this company called standard process,

1024
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:23,730
there are whole food supplement company.

1025
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:29,030
I'm really involved in Chiropractic and
acupuncture and they presented them with

1026
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:29,731
this and I said,

1027
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:29,911
hey,

1028
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:30,780
what do you guys think?

1029
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,060
Like is there a way to
like figure this out?

1030
00:26:33,061 --> 00:26:33,421
And they're like,

1031
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:35,460
well we have 20 of the top doctors,

1032
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:36,161
nutritionists,

1033
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,200
food scientists,

1034
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:37,771
you know,

1035
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:40,410
on our staff and this innovation
center around nutrition,

1036
00:26:40,411 --> 00:26:41,970
like come in the lab with us.

1037
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:44,670
And so they'd never done
this with an athlete before,

1038
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:45,660
but they were intrigued.

1039
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:47,970
And so I actually went and
did a year's long worth of,

1040
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,331
you know,

1041
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:49,850
a hundred plus blood test,

1042
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,910
vo two Max test,

1043
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:53,130
all this fitness testing
all around my physiology.

1044
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:57,210
And they created ultimately a custom
food solution as I a bar form essentially

1045
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:58,200
called the column Bar.

1046
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,030
That was all whole food ingredients.

1047
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:00,451
It was no,

1048
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:00,660
you know,

1049
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,710
chemical to rivers or anything.

1050
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:02,160
It was,

1051
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,341
you know,

1052
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:03,360
coconut oil,

1053
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:03,631
you know,

1054
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:04,171
seeds,

1055
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:04,771
nuts,

1056
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:04,951
you know,

1057
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:08,400
all these different pieces
of macronutrients as well
as micronutrient blends

1058
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:08,851
that I needed,

1059
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:11,190
but custom tailored to my physiology.

1060
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,150
Um,

1061
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:12,961
and that's what I mean.

1062
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:14,160
That was the bulk of what I ate.

1063
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:16,230
I ate 7,000 calories per day.

1064
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,060
I was burning 10,000,

1065
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:19,080
so even at 7,000,

1066
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:20,460
I was losing about a pound of day,

1067
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,870
a way of weight almost,

1068
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,470
um,

1069
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,061
to my body.

1070
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:24,420
So that's why I needed to get bigger.

1071
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,870
But these column bars just burned
super efficiently and my body,

1072
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:30,090
like it was just the
perfect blend of everything.

1073
00:27:30,091 --> 00:27:32,760
So eating the same thing every single day
for 54 days might have gotten a little

1074
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:33,271
bit boring,

1075
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:34,170
but my body was just,

1076
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,670
it was actually pretty dialed in.

1077
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,773
Wow.

1078
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,230
Now when they did this and they,

1079
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,440
they made these custom bars for you,

1080
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,540
did they know how,

1081
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:43,821
I mean,

1082
00:27:43,821 --> 00:27:46,970
how did you know how many calories
you're going to be burning where you're

1083
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:48,710
pulling this 300 pound sled?

1084
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,570
Was it dependent upon the conditions?

1085
00:27:50,571 --> 00:27:54,460
Like if the snow was more packed or IC,

1086
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,120
it be difficult.

1087
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:57,770
If it was some soft,

1088
00:27:57,771 --> 00:27:58,260
right?

1089
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,750
100% so I mean we had
to use our best guests,

1090
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,350
honestly,

1091
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,250
we had to just say,

1092
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,360
let you use our best gas.

1093
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:05,580
I had guys had a bunch of
smart people smarter than me.

1094
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:06,211
We're in this room,

1095
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:06,961
all these doctors,

1096
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:08,160
these PhDs around this.

1097
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:10,980
And we had to make some assumptions
and ultimately they were like,

1098
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:11,221
okay,

1099
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:12,630
you're going to burn 10,000 calories.

1100
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:14,760
Let's get you 10,000
calories in these bars.

1101
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,860
And we started running the weight
on the sled and we're like,

1102
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,420
that'll be a 500 pound sled.

1103
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,590
Like we can't carry that.

1104
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:20,910
So it's this equation of like,

1105
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,530
can you make this led light enough to
pull if we can get the nutrition right,

1106
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:27,210
how efficiently does
that burn in your body?

1107
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:28,710
How much can your stomach absorb?

1108
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,000
You're hungry the whole time.

1109
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,141
More or less?

1110
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:31,410
Yeah.

1111
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,310
Fuck yeah,

1112
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:32,790
I was,

1113
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,410
I was ready for a big fucking meal.

1114
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,463
I got done.

1115
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,260
What's the first thing you ate?

1116
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,100
Uh,

1117
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,910
this,

1118
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,880
the first thing I ate when
I got back was a big burger.

1119
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:44,310
But you might call me
lame for saying this,

1120
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:45,210
but I'm just going to say,

1121
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:46,044
cause it's the truth.

1122
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,550
What I craved was salad man.

1123
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:48,990
What I craved was just something,

1124
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,641
you know what I mean?

1125
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,380
I've been eating like
this freeze dried field.

1126
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:54,370
It's like chunk of Colombar,

1127
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,111
which got me through,

1128
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:57,480
but it was like something green and alive.

1129
00:28:57,481 --> 00:29:00,330
And so I like this big salad
with avocado and sadly,

1130
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:00,540
no,

1131
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,410
I had a big burger too.

1132
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:03,000
But then of course I eat,

1133
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:04,110
my stomach has shrunk,

1134
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,920
right?

1135
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,780
I eat this big meal and I'm like,

1136
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,890
oh my stomach of hurts.

1137
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:09,240
But mostly I was like,

1138
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,980
I'm back in the real world baby.

1139
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:11,610
So it was like,

1140
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,530
it was everything I could get my hands.

1141
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:14,341
I went to a buffet,

1142
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:15,570
it just was like my stomach was hurting,

1143
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:15,930
but I was like,

1144
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:16,920
I'm not going to stop.

1145
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:21,921
And I just started eating like whatever
croissants and bread was all the things.

1146
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:22,950
So,

1147
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,783
uh,

1148
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,810
imagine your body would like you
probably craving all that life.

1149
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,820
Why live things green?

1150
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,521
Exactly.

1151
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:32,500
Vegetables and fruit.

1152
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,401
It's weird to say,

1153
00:29:33,401 --> 00:29:34,540
I mean like I'm from Portland,

1154
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:34,991
Oregon,

1155
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:35,261
you know,

1156
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:39,070
it's pretty green part of the world up
there in the Pacific northwest and not

1157
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:39,870
even just the,

1158
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,960
the food component,

1159
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:41,860
an art.

1160
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,940
There's nothing alive out there.

1161
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:44,750
There's no animals on the coast.

1162
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:44,921
There are.

1163
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:46,950
But like in the interior
and I see any animals.

1164
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:47,771
I don't see a bird.

1165
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:48,910
I didn't see nothing.

1166
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:49,570
Right.

1167
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,040
And so not only have,

1168
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,520
I think as humans we're kind
of wired to see things living.

1169
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:55,840
I mean even here in La,

1170
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:56,890
a bit of a concrete jungle,

1171
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:58,210
but like you see trees on this tree,

1172
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,044
you see the ocean,

1173
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,010
whatever.

1174
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,850
That's what a Nazi,

1175
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,040
anything alive for 54 days.

1176
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:03,461
It was like,

1177
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:03,671
wow,

1178
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:05,770
I want to like smell trees,

1179
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:06,940
fresh air and the trees.

1180
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:07,990
I want to eat a salad.

1181
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:08,321
I don't know.

1182
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:11,980
Like that's where I'm like my mind got
to is kind of coming back to reality in

1183
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:12,800
that way,

1184
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,161
man.

1185
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:16,610
So when they're constructing
these bars for you,

1186
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,880
and this is all based on your body
and like what burns well with you,

1187
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,720
how do they like in terms
of like how many cat,

1188
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:31,721
what's the best food in terms of weight
versus calories and is there some foods

1189
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,520
that are heavier but don't
have as many calories?

1190
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:34,961
Yeah,

1191
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:38,590
so I think I'm going to get the
numbers pretty close to right here,

1192
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:43,030
but I think per hour fat of course
of the macronutrients we got protein,

1193
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:43,930
fat and carbs.

1194
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:44,170
Right?

1195
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:44,630
Right.

1196
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,130
Um,

1197
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,530
fat is the most calorie dense of the mall.

1198
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,200
You have to make sure these
things don't freeze solid.

1199
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,411
Right.

1200
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:51,244
So that was one of the,

1201
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,920
it was minus 25 and my
sled every single day.

1202
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:56,800
So it had to actually be edible
while frozen essentially.

1203
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:58,390
Cause it'd be too hard to rewarm them.

1204
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:00,580
Cause this was a food I was
eating outside of my sled.

1205
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,610
So what actually frozen too frozen too.

1206
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,020
But actually where we,

1207
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,310
where the work around happened,

1208
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:07,690
where they kind of their mastermind was,

1209
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:07,991
they were like,

1210
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:12,040
you actually need this macro nutrient
plan to be about 40 or 45% fats because I

1211
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:13,210
needed high fat food,

1212
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:13,860
you know,

1213
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,320
um,

1214
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,550
to stay alive out there.

1215
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,430
And so they basically pumped
it full of coconut oil,

1216
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,630
which ultimately,

1217
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,060
you know,

1218
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,371
does it,

1219
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:20,531
you know,

1220
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:21,730
you see coconut on the shelf,

1221
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:22,451
it's not a liquid.

1222
00:31:22,451 --> 00:31:23,320
It's actually a solid,

1223
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:25,000
but it doesn't freeze like rock solid.

1224
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:27,640
So having that much coconut
oil in it allowed it to,

1225
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,180
we actually had to get it shipped down
frozen because if it didn't freeze it

1226
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:31,570
got,

1227
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,950
it actually kind of got like flat.

1228
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:34,450
And so they put it in
these freeze dried packs,

1229
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:35,500
shipped it down to Chile,

1230
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:37,450
had to do this whole
customs thing to import it.

1231
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:38,021
It was like a whole,

1232
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,550
like crazy logistical mess.

1233
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,150
Uh,

1234
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,270
but got that done and it actually held
up so that it was enough fat in there

1235
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:45,370
that I could actually bite off
chunks of this rather than,

1236
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:45,791
you know,

1237
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:49,030
there's plenty of stories of guys and
he's cold places breaking teeth on Clif

1238
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:49,900
bars and you know,

1239
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,741
things like that.

1240
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:51,330
So,

1241
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:51,701
uh,

1242
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,950
the column bars were,

1243
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:53,211
were,

1244
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,030
were at good Goodwell frozen.

1245
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,390
So it's mostly

1246
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,060
like a lot of fats and seeds and

1247
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,961
seasoned nuts.

1248
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:06,460
And then the other thing is that they,

1249
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:06,970
like I said,

1250
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,480
they're their bread and
butter at this company.

1251
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:09,270
Standard processes,

1252
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,960
they're a supplement company,

1253
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:11,201
so,

1254
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:12,520
but it's all whole food derivative.

1255
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:14,170
So organic farm,

1256
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,390
basically a vitamins.

1257
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:21,280
And so they actually intermixed like
probiotics and magnesium and like beat

1258
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:24,670
extract and all these sorts of plant
derivatives as well to give me the Fido

1259
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:25,421
nutrients I need.

1260
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:26,470
That's not giving me the calories,

1261
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:27,304
but that's giving me the,

1262
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,750
and I stayed healthy the whole
time and I got super worn down.

1263
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,730
I got super skinny,

1264
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:30,881
you know,

1265
00:32:30,881 --> 00:32:31,750
all that kind of stuff.

1266
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:33,370
But I actually stayed,

1267
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:33,491
you know,

1268
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:34,480
I never got sick,

1269
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:34,811
you know,

1270
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:35,561
I still healthy.

1271
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:35,840
That

1272
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,651
was my other question.

1273
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:40,040
Like what was the plan if you did
get sick it was just to wait it out

1274
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,873
in the tent,

1275
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,960
waited out in the tent.

1276
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,441
Um,

1277
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:42,910
you know,

1278
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,520
there there's,

1279
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,620
there is a contact with anything though.

1280
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,130
Right.

1281
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,963
So I had,

1282
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,141
I had a couple of things.

1283
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:50,060
One is I had my gps,

1284
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,100
which I was paying a satellite every
10 but I mean is a life form so no,

1285
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:54,934
no,

1286
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,260
no,

1287
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,371
no,

1288
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:56,204
no.

1289
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:56,840
Yeah,

1290
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,320
sorry.

1291
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,070
Um,

1292
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,311
yeah.

1293
00:32:58,311 --> 00:32:59,480
So that part of it,

1294
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,680
there's nothing out there.

1295
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:02,150
So basically if you get a bacteria,

1296
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:03,080
you've brought it out there.

1297
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,560
So they actually idea was more or less
to get out there healthy rather than you

1298
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:08,900
can stay pretty healthy in
terms of bacteria and stuff.

1299
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,040
Of course you can get pretty worn
down and sick and the cold or flu like

1300
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:16,620
symptoms or that something
you had when you land.

1301
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,211
Exactly.

1302
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:17,541
Cause there's,

1303
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,010
I mean there's nothing
out there and are you,

1304
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,630
were you concerned about that?

1305
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,320
Because like I would imagine like the
anticipation leading up to it is a little

1306
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:27,770
stressful and sometimes your
immune system can get run down.

1307
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,880
Oh a hundred percent.

1308
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:29,360
You know,

1309
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,200
of course it,

1310
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:31,034
uh,

1311
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,880
it's fun to recount the epic parts
of these journeys are my other,

1312
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:35,091
you know,

1313
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:38,570
world records climbing Everest or this
summit day or this push or whatever.

1314
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,310
But anything that's this long duration,

1315
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,540
this was 54 days.

1316
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:41,991
The world record,

1317
00:33:41,991 --> 00:33:42,470
I didn't,

1318
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,300
2006 was 139 days.

1319
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:45,680
Like the boring answer is like,

1320
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:46,251
how did you do it?

1321
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:46,521
It's like,

1322
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:46,791
well,

1323
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:50,030
like I washed my hands really code when
I went to the airport and I didn't eat

1324
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:51,480
this like food off the street and I,

1325
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:51,741
you know,

1326
00:33:51,741 --> 00:33:52,670
staying healthy,

1327
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,410
you can't get that right.

1328
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,070
You know,

1329
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,030
it doesn't matter.

1330
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:56,864
You know,

1331
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,580
imagine you were on the flight headed
out there and some dude next to sneezing.

1332
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,200
Yeah.

1333
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,700
Oh yeah.

1334
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,151
Mother,

1335
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:02,690
fuck.

1336
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,920
There was a couple of times,

1337
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,550
uh,

1338
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,170
when I raised triathlon many years ago,

1339
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:08,720
I think I raised in something
like 25 countries over the world,

1340
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:10,790
different places and there are
three or four times I can remember,

1341
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,770
like I remember one time
I flew to the Philippines.

1342
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:15,770
It's a place called Subic Bay
gearing up for this big race.

1343
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:16,341
And sure enough,

1344
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:17,270
the night before the race,

1345
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:18,830
just like diarrhea,

1346
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:20,990
like crazy puke in my brains out.

1347
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,860
So I,

1348
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,880
I jumped into,

1349
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,470
I jump into the swim swim in the ocean,

1350
00:34:24,471 --> 00:34:24,621
you know,

1351
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:25,970
it's a milestone and feeling like shit.

1352
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:26,241
And I'm like,

1353
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:26,331
Oh,

1354
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,160
I'm going to try through
all the Philippines.

1355
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:29,180
Like I got to do this race,

1356
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:29,810
you know.

1357
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,860
Sure enough on the bike.

1358
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,270
I get on my bike and my bike,

1359
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,000
the bike course run right next to
my hotel and I just had no power.

1360
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,420
And I was like,

1361
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:35,721
Yup,

1362
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:36,840
I'm turning off in the Filipino guys.

1363
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,130
Like,

1364
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:37,281
no,

1365
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:37,431
no,

1366
00:34:37,431 --> 00:34:38,180
you're going the wrong way.

1367
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,511
The chorus.

1368
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,020
And I was like,

1369
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,560
Nope,

1370
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,400
I'm going to my hotel room
to shit some more basically.

1371
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:43,101
So yeah,

1372
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:43,351
one,

1373
00:34:43,351 --> 00:34:44,240
one bad burrito,

1374
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:44,661
one bad.

1375
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:45,320
This can ruin,

1376
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,680
you know,

1377
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,060
any athletic performance.

1378
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:47,894
I mean,

1379
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,570
sorry Rhea,

1380
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:51,490
while you're pulling a 375
pounds sled in it and article.

1381
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:52,921
Oh my God.

1382
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:53,661
Was that a pretty well,

1383
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:56,450
but that is not a pretty bad place with
the one pair of underwear that it gets

1384
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:56,990
even more.

1385
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,880
Oh so get,

1386
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,790
stay unhealthy was,

1387
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,470
was super key to all of this.

1388
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:03,951
But you know,

1389
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:06,560
all things considered I me and my
body of course got banged up some.

1390
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:07,650
But like I came out,

1391
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:07,910
you know,

1392
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,730
relatively healthy and I think the
food nutrition was a key part of that.

1393
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:10,961
Oh,

1394
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:11,830
it has to be what?

1395
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,760
It sounds like you really did it wisely.

1396
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:14,650
Like you,

1397
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,140
I mean that's so cool that you had that
company behind you that organize the

1398
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:18,950
preparation.

1399
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,650
Yeah,

1400
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,210
yeah,

1401
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:20,540
yeah.

1402
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,620
Good Lord Man.

1403
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,790
Now we trying to put fat on
before you left as well as muscle.

1404
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,331
Yeah.

1405
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:27,170
So with Mike,

1406
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,471
you know,

1407
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:28,640
the goal was to put,

1408
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,091
you know,

1409
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:33,440
I put about 10 to 15 pounds of muscle on
and then another five pounds of fat on

1410
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:33,951
top of that.

1411
00:35:33,951 --> 00:35:37,470
Just knowing that I've got
total was 20 pounds total.

1412
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:38,190
But you know,

1413
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,870
between fat and the last,

1414
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,520
the last few weeks I was,

1415
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:41,760
you know,

1416
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,720
basically I'd be lifted.

1417
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:43,830
I know I've gotten strong and all this,

1418
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:45,120
didn't want to wear myself out too much,

1419
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:45,600
you know,

1420
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,090
stressing my muscles because I
was about to go undergo this.

1421
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,710
And it was where I was just
putting calories and inside,

1422
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:50,970
you know,

1423
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,760
eat dinner and then Jen
and my wife would be like,

1424
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:54,450
what are you going to edit out?

1425
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:54,731
And a like,

1426
00:35:54,731 --> 00:35:56,130
should I be sitting there
to eat and like a pine of,

1427
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:56,490
you know,

1428
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,241
coconut bliss,

1429
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:57,631
ice cream,

1430
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:58,291
whatever it was,

1431
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:58,441
you know,

1432
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:01,520
putting calories into just to put some
fat on there cause I just burned off meet

1433
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:02,341
immediately.

1434
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:03,151
I mean it was gone.

1435
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:04,200
So yeah.

1436
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,780
So you must have been shredded
by the time it was over.

1437
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,130
Yeah,

1438
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,150
I uh,

1439
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,811
I was pretty,

1440
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:10,770
that there was actually out of,

1441
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,251
I'll pull it up,

1442
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:13,410
but there's a photo of my Instagram
that's kind of shows a little bit of the

1443
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:14,940
before and the after body shot,

1444
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:15,421
but I,

1445
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:16,110
uh,

1446
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,321
yeah,

1447
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:16,591
I was,

1448
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,670
I was very lean,

1449
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,290
but it was honestly,

1450
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:20,130
it was also scary.

1451
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:22,140
Like in the end I think
I held up pretty well.

1452
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:23,340
But you're out there by yourself,

1453
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:24,390
you've got no context.

1454
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:27,060
And so I started looking down at my
legs halfway through this journey.

1455
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:27,690
Uh,

1456
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:27,900
yeah.

1457
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,261
There I am.

1458
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:31,740
So before and after that
much of a difference.

1459
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,581
Yeah,

1460
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:32,971
it's a little,

1461
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:33,804
the light's not great.

1462
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,810
You definitely look a lot more lean.

1463
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,650
More,

1464
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,660
I wouldn't even say a lot more lean.

1465
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,080
Yeah.

1466
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,670
So it's about 20 pounds different.

1467
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:44,250
But my mind's playing tricks
on me more than anything.

1468
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:47,280
I looked down at my waist about
halfway through and I was like,

1469
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,090
Holy Shit.

1470
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,650
Like I'm falling apart here.

1471
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:52,200
And I actually started getting in my own
head about am I losing too much weight?

1472
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:52,591
Am I not?

1473
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:53,730
But when I,

1474
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,260
when I actually weighed myself afterwards,

1475
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:56,041
like 20 pounds,

1476
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,840
like we thought it could have
been as much as 40 pounds.

1477
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,610
So you know,

1478
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,760
only losing 20 pounds.

1479
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:00,810
All things considered like,

1480
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:00,961
yeah,

1481
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:01,291
like you said,

1482
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:04,050
I don't look that other than that
really cool beard that I grew up.

1483
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,153
Um,

1484
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,030
so you were ready to get going?

1485
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,191
Yeah,

1486
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:08,561
I mean we,

1487
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:09,570
we have planned for that.

1488
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,291
We have planned for that.

1489
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:10,711
And like I said,

1490
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:11,491
I started out,

1491
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:15,390
I started out about one 65 I put myself
up to one 85 to leave and I finished at

1492
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:18,420
one 65 so actually finished way
more near my sort of natural,

1493
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,100
fairly lean weight for my height.

1494
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,230
Perfect plan.

1495
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,280
But there's,

1496
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,360
there's plenty of things to be wrong,

1497
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:28,260
but kind of planned out
for things going wrong.

1498
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,561
Yeah,

1499
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:29,450
I mean I'm,

1500
00:37:29,451 --> 00:37:30,121
I'm probably like this,

1501
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:32,670
this was in one one way as a solo effort.

1502
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:34,620
I mean I was out there by
myself walking across this,

1503
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:37,470
but this was a massive team
effort from these guys.

1504
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:38,131
Get behind me,

1505
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,180
all these doctors,

1506
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:39,691
you know,

1507
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,610
all the different people
I have supporting me,

1508
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:41,791
my,

1509
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:42,001
you know,

1510
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:44,520
my wife and then what she does
with all of the media and the,

1511
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:46,320
our nonprofit and it was the Benny things.

1512
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,360
A lot of pieces go into
making this thing happen.

1513
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:49,740
So it was a team effort for sure.

1514
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:50,550
Big Time.

1515
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,230
That is so amazing.

1516
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,720
Now at the end you get there,

1517
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:55,554
you're done.

1518
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,640
But there's no one there.

1519
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,271
So what do you do?

1520
00:37:57,271 --> 00:37:58,200
You make a phone call?

1521
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,400
Yeah,

1522
00:37:59,400 --> 00:37:59,851
I'm done.

1523
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:00,684
Come get me.

1524
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,300
They know where you are
because they're tracking you,

1525
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:03,720
right?

1526
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,111
Yeah.

1527
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:07,110
So what was kind of crazy
was that crazy last push,

1528
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:07,321
right?

1529
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:10,770
It's this 32 hour nonstop push,

1530
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,250
uh,

1531
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:11,971
till the end.

1532
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:15,030
And so what happened is it's
Christmas Day when I start this push.

1533
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:16,260
And so my whole family,

1534
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:16,651
uh,

1535
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:17,221
I'm actually,

1536
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:18,750
I have five older sisters,

1537
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,980
big family,

1538
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:20,161
you know,

1539
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:20,401
I'm the,

1540
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:23,520
I'm the baby of the bunch and they're
all together and Hood River Oregon at my

1541
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:25,830
sister's house and they're thinking cool.

1542
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:27,720
Colin's like getting close
to end of his project.

1543
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:30,960
We'll track him and everyday they track
me on my gps at ping the satellites

1544
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:31,590
every 10 minutes.

1545
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:31,981
So people,

1546
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:32,820
all my Instagram followers,

1547
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:35,010
anyone could actually follow
the progress in real time.

1548
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,260
And they were used to seeing me stop
at about 1212 hours into the day.

1549
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:40,750
So 12 hours into the day
happens and they're like,

1550
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:41,861
okay,

1551
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,730
maybe he's going another hour,

1552
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:43,541
13 hours,

1553
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:44,440
14 hours,

1554
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,340
15 hours.

1555
00:38:45,341 --> 00:38:45,731
They're like,

1556
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:46,660
what's going on?

1557
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,381
16 hours.

1558
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:48,760
My whole family is not normally together,

1559
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:50,230
but they're all together
cause it's Christmas Day.

1560
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:50,650
Finally,

1561
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,150
18 hours into this push.

1562
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,990
I finally stop and pet up away point
because what happened was I ran out of

1563
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:57,490
water even though I said I'm not stopping.

1564
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:57,910
I was like,

1565
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,980
I only had three liters
of water after 18 hours,

1566
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,180
I need more water so I at least have
to put my tent up to boil water inside.

1567
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,830
So what I do,

1568
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,731
it's now midnight.

1569
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:08,160
I started at 6:00 AM it's now midnight up.

1570
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:09,070
We going to 18 hours.

1571
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,290
A midnight in Antarctica is a,

1572
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:14,410
with the times when I was staying
on was 7:00 PM on the west coast.

1573
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:15,610
So it's Christmas dinner.

1574
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:17,170
I finally call and it's my mom,

1575
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:17,921
my sister,

1576
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:18,521
my wife,

1577
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:19,510
like everyone's on the phone,

1578
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:19,990
they're like,

1579
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,651
oh my God,

1580
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:22,450
you did 47 miles today.

1581
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:23,350
That's your best buy,

1582
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:24,370
like 15 miles.

1583
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,213
Incredible.

1584
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:25,990
And I was like,

1585
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,141
no,

1586
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:26,221
no,

1587
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:26,560
no,

1588
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,400
I'm not stopping.

1589
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:30,400
I'm actually just boiling water for an
hour to continue back out for another

1590
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,930
like 14 hours to finish this thing.

1591
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:32,291
And they're like,

1592
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:33,124
what?

1593
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,450
The weather must be really good.

1594
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:34,691
Wow,

1595
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:35,471
you're feeling so good.

1596
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:36,190
And I was like,

1597
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:36,460
I was like,

1598
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,960
actually it's a the worst weather of the
entire trip because this massive ground

1599
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:41,471
blizzard blue,

1600
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:41,680
like,

1601
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,210
like our 16 of this push.

1602
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:45,160
It was nice just this ground blizzard,

1603
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:45,371
which is,

1604
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:46,390
it's not actually snowing,

1605
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:49,270
but it feels like it's knowing cause
it's so windy that the snow was blowing

1606
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:50,140
around everywhere.

1607
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,790
But I was locked in such a deep flow
state in my mind that even setting my tent

1608
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:55,810
up in this crazy storm,

1609
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,940
even getting inside 18 hour push,

1610
00:39:57,941 --> 00:39:58,774
I was just like,

1611
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,110
Nope,

1612
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,861
I've got this.

1613
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:01,000
And it felt like for me,

1614
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:02,410
when I reflect on that moment,

1615
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,200
um,

1616
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,150
Jenna even says this,

1617
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:04,301
you know,

1618
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,610
she talked to me every night and
there there's clips of me crying.

1619
00:40:06,611 --> 00:40:08,290
There's clips of me having doubts,

1620
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:08,411
you know,

1621
00:40:08,411 --> 00:40:09,780
there was ups and downs
to this whole thing.

1622
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,450
She was like,

1623
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:14,230
you sounded the most lucid I've ever
heard you and she's watching me high

1624
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:14,941
performing or things.

1625
00:40:14,941 --> 00:40:15,340
She was like,

1626
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,660
you were locked in.

1627
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:17,770
And so instead of her going like,

1628
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,660
maybe you should sleep
and like get some rest.

1629
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:20,260
She was like,

1630
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:20,861
I trust you.

1631
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:21,040
Like,

1632
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,551
I believe you,

1633
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:22,301
like go for it.

1634
00:40:22,301 --> 00:40:23,860
She could just hear it in my voice.

1635
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,790
Um,

1636
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,040
and it was a crazy thing and I it for me,

1637
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,060
you know,

1638
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:33,060
I'm 33 years old now and it really felt
like a culmination of my entire life and

1639
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:37,120
a lot of ways like from the swim
practices as a little kid too,

1640
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:37,630
you know,

1641
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,510
I got burned in this crazy fire that I
overcame and talking about that if you

1642
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:40,830
want,

1643
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,350
I,

1644
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:41,830
you know,

1645
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:42,131
race,

1646
00:40:42,131 --> 00:40:42,731
triathlon,

1647
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,261
professional,

1648
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:45,780
we all have these moments
with the meditation practice,

1649
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,240
the,

1650
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,871
the family,

1651
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:47,441
the support,

1652
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:47,750
like suck.

1653
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,190
All of these things were stacking on
each other to kind of lead to this final

1654
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:52,180
culminating moment.

1655
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,930
And I had to pull on lessons from each
phase of my life to be that locked in.

1656
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,430
But I found myself just,

1657
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:57,970
you know,

1658
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,320
kind of in that moment,

1659
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:00,370
in that flow state,

1660
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:00,970
um,

1661
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,370
being able to get up out of
that hour 18 and say to them,

1662
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:03,761
actually,

1663
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,710
I'm going back out and
this crazy ground blizzard.

1664
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:07,750
I got another 14 hours to
go to finish this thing.

1665
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:08,584
And so that was,

1666
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:08,891
you know,

1667
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:10,930
32 hours and 77 miles later,

1668
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:12,790
the final push to the end.

1669
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:18,290
Now what did you wear in terms of like
a base layer and we was there concern

1670
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:21,390
about you sweating while
you're pulling all that weight,

1671
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:23,850
especially initially
when it was 375 pounds.

1672
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,291
Yeah.

1673
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:25,140
So you know,

1674
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,810
one of the famous lines that,

1675
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,050
you know,

1676
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,530
people who have been in the polar
environments will say is if you sweat,

1677
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:31,130
you die.

1678
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:31,640
Um,

1679
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,061
and you know,

1680
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:35,030
it's maybe a little bit hyperbole
but it's not far from the truth,

1681
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:38,870
which is you start sweating and
you stopped for even 30 seconds.

1682
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,970
You're clothes are literally
freezing to your body.

1683
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,800
And so it was this crazy kind of kind
of balance of being able to pull this

1684
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:46,310
sled,

1685
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,910
get your heart rate elevated enough to
keep your body warm but not too warm that

1686
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:50,744
you were sweating.

1687
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,760
And so any second I would start sweating,

1688
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:54,140
I would strip layers off.

1689
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:54,980
So there was times,

1690
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:56,240
especially when there was no wind,

1691
00:41:56,241 --> 00:41:58,070
it's still be ambient
temperature minus 20,

1692
00:41:58,071 --> 00:41:58,970
minus 25,

1693
00:41:58,971 --> 00:42:02,480
but I would just have like a thin
gore tex jacket on and one base layer.

1694
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,110
That's it.

1695
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,490
I mean we were in Marino.

1696
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,010
Marino actually itches my skin,

1697
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:07,671
although it's really good.

1698
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:09,320
But for me I'm a little
bit allergic to it.

1699
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:09,681
Um,

1700
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:11,150
so I work synthetic fabric,

1701
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,530
have a synthetic that completely mimics
Marino in terms of the way when it's

1702
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:16,011
moist,

1703
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:17,090
he still stay warm.

1704
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,430
Yeah,

1705
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:17,780
somewhere.

1706
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,211
Marina.

1707
00:42:18,211 --> 00:42:18,801
I honestly,

1708
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:20,780
Marino is amazing fabric for that reason.

1709
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:21,031
Um,

1710
00:42:21,031 --> 00:42:21,771
unfortunately for me,

1711
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:22,101
like I said,

1712
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:23,450
it just irritates my skin.

1713
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:23,631
Oh,

1714
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:27,170
funny that you could suffer close,

1715
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,960
go maybe feel that.

1716
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,100
Uh,

1717
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,431
no,

1718
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:31,970
but uh,

1719
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,510
so I used to synthetic but it's crazy.

1720
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:34,341
Are you using like what,

1721
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:34,660
what,

1722
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,020
what?

1723
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,450
Um,

1724
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,370
I was using mountain hardware base layers.

1725
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:37,730
Um,

1726
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,080
and then actually my outer layer,

1727
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:41,420
so this Norwegian company
called Bergen's of Norway,

1728
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:42,260
they don't sponsor me,

1729
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:43,094
but they actually,

1730
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:43,971
believe it or not,

1731
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:46,670
the Norwegians know a thing or two
about being in the polar environment.

1732
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:50,090
And so they've designed a really good
jacket and pant that sexually really

1733
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:51,110
breathable and really good.

1734
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:53,360
And then I suit sewed a for rough,

1735
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:53,751
uh,

1736
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:54,381
onto the edge.

1737
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:55,640
So a wolf,

1738
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,240
a wolf,

1739
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,760
uh,

1740
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,140
uh,

1741
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,290
for rough on the outer side of the foot.

1742
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,300
I think it's Wolffia
Wolf Wolf for thought.

1743
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,690
You were saying Whoa,

1744
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:03,921
whoa.

1745
00:43:03,921 --> 00:43:04,371
And I was like,

1746
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:05,410
it sounds like wolf.

1747
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,590
You know more about this than me.

1748
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:08,750
I'm not the output of know your audience.

1749
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:09,160
I have nothing.

1750
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,610
I have not a big hunter myself.

1751
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:11,061
I've never,

1752
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:12,050
never had done that,

1753
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:12,651
a lot of that.

1754
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:13,041
But uh,

1755
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:13,340
yeah,

1756
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,173
that's a wolf.

1757
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:14,630
Well,

1758
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,130
they know how to survive in the cold.

1759
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:16,281
Yeah,

1760
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:17,001
exactly.

1761
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:19,160
So the base layer is a synthetic.

1762
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:21,260
What is the material
that it's made out of?

1763
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,191
The base layer is,

1764
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:22,371
yeah,

1765
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:22,680
it's a thing.

1766
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,630
It's a synthetic.

1767
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:24,680
I'm like a poly,

1768
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:25,670
polypropylene,

1769
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:26,893
something like that.

1770
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:27,771
When it sweats,

1771
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,604
it dries quickly.

1772
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:29,880
That's,

1773
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,591
it dries quickly.

1774
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,510
But the idea was just to not get it wet,

1775
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:34,850
so basically stripped
down as much as possible.

1776
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:35,450
Um,

1777
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:38,720
but like literally I'd go from that and
then of course I needed to eat and drink

1778
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:39,501
every whatever,

1779
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:40,900
30 minutes or whatever,

1780
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,040
actually more like every hour.

1781
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:42,883
So I'd stop.

1782
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,320
So I'd stop in the front of my sled.

1783
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:46,730
I had a huge puffy down jacket,

1784
00:43:46,731 --> 00:43:48,650
like a massive like Michelin man,

1785
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:49,910
huge Buffy down jacket.

1786
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:53,960
So even if you're stopping for a minute
to drink water before even trying to do

1787
00:43:53,961 --> 00:43:54,290
that,

1788
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:54,621
boom,

1789
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:58,220
put the big jacket on because that's
how cold or how cold you can get

1790
00:43:58,221 --> 00:43:59,630
immediately from stopping.

1791
00:43:59,631 --> 00:43:59,811
I mean,

1792
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:01,730
it's just so much colder
than when pulling the sled.

1793
00:44:01,731 --> 00:44:03,440
Your heart rate stays up
and keeps you pretty warm.

1794
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,600
Imagining like your,

1795
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,340
your hands and your feet to
that would be a real issue,

1796
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:07,550
right?

1797
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:08,660
The small digits.

1798
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:08,991
Yeah.

1799
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:09,430
I mean,

1800
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:09,660
you know,

1801
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,360
frostbites real for sure.

1802
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:12,920
Hands outside of the clubs.

1803
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:15,650
That's why some of this stuff I was doing
in the training of get my hands with a

1804
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:16,311
dexterity,

1805
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:16,461
you know,

1806
00:44:16,461 --> 00:44:18,230
you have to tie all these
knots with big gloves,

1807
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:18,830
mittens on.

1808
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,200
You can't take your gloves off
for any sizable period of time.

1809
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:22,100
Uh,

1810
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,300
if you look back on a lot of my photos,

1811
00:44:23,301 --> 00:44:26,420
I've actually got tape on my face
over across my nose and my cheeks.

1812
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,110
And that's because I started getting
tiny little bits of frostbite,

1813
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,350
uh,

1814
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,050
on the bottoms,

1815
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:31,861
my nose and on,

1816
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:34,890
on my cheeks because I'd wear a
full face mask buff everything.

1817
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:35,724
But even,

1818
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,030
you know,

1819
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:36,960
tiny little,

1820
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,351
you know,

1821
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:37,880
one,

1822
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,640
you know,

1823
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,180
needle prick of wind on
your face throughout the day
and that cold it's going to

1824
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:43,380
turn into a cold injury.

1825
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:45,570
And so I started getting a
few cold injuries on my face.

1826
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:46,403
Nothing,

1827
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:46,710
you know,

1828
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,840
too bad you're looking at Greece,

1829
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,070
your face up or anything like mostly the,

1830
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:50,760
the tape.

1831
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,300
Um,

1832
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,450
and then so I had a little bit of like
Vaseline or like chap stick type of stuff

1833
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:55,370
on some of the batteries.

1834
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,310
The one thing actually that I
did that I had never done before,

1835
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:00,011
we're actually worked well,

1836
00:45:00,011 --> 00:45:00,811
it was a tip that I got,

1837
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:03,060
which was my fingers
started cracking really,

1838
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:04,320
really bad from the cold.

1839
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:07,140
And so they were like really
painful and actually was pouring,

1840
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:08,910
putting super glue into all of those,

1841
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:11,370
basically little micro cuts on my fingers,

1842
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,440
which when someone told
me that as a trick,

1843
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:13,771
I was like,

1844
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:14,250
really?

1845
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,610
But turns out it's
actually really good trick.

1846
00:45:16,611 --> 00:45:20,100
So that's kind of super gluing these
cuts on my fingers back together.

1847
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,611
Um,

1848
00:45:20,611 --> 00:45:22,170
and that actually worked reasonably well.

1849
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:22,741
All things kids.

1850
00:45:22,741 --> 00:45:22,981
I mean,

1851
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:25,500
I was all things considered
is the operative word,

1852
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:26,880
but yeah.

1853
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,750
Wow.

1854
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,430
So you're wearing the,

1855
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,660
what about your eyes?

1856
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:31,890
So I'm wearing,

1857
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,300
I'm wearing a goggles.

1858
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:34,200
Um,

1859
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,981
but you know,

1860
00:45:34,981 --> 00:45:35,730
funny enough,

1861
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:36,420
you know,

1862
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,051
I had a couple of,

1863
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:37,090
uh,

1864
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:37,300
you know,

1865
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:37,710
fancier,

1866
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,150
nicer ski goggles with me.

1867
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,110
Um,

1868
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:40,530
but,

1869
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:40,660
uh,

1870
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:40,831
yeah,

1871
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:42,750
there's the tape on my face right there.

1872
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:43,800
Um,

1873
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,251
but,

1874
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:44,910
uh,

1875
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:45,281
but yeah,

1876
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:45,510
it's like,

1877
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,370
that's actually just
like the normal KT tape,

1878
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:49,620
like a physio tape that you'd
see like athletes wearing.

1879
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,030
And I just had it in my repair kit.

1880
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:52,200
It wasn't meant for this purpose,

1881
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:52,621
but I was like,

1882
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:56,100
what do I have that I could put on my
face to block it a little bit better?

1883
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,240
Um,

1884
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,830
but I had those goggles
on some of the time,

1885
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:01,620
but actually the goggle that I wore the
most was one that you would might use

1886
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:02,670
for motocross.

1887
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,150
Um,

1888
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,570
cause it has like a plastic
face mask over the front of it.

1889
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:07,290
Um,

1890
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:07,891
cause the wind,

1891
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:08,730
when it was blowing,

1892
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:09,960
it would just kind of blow around.

1893
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:12,090
So sometimes I had this
flea stripped over my face,

1894
00:46:12,091 --> 00:46:13,200
but it blow too much.

1895
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,700
Um,

1896
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,630
and so I had this more plastic face masks,

1897
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:15,961
gas,

1898
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:16,221
so that,

1899
00:46:16,221 --> 00:46:17,040
that's the,

1900
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,780
that's when you can see lookout frozen.

1901
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:19,471
It's frozen.

1902
00:46:19,471 --> 00:46:20,690
It is on the inside.

1903
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,280
Oh my God,

1904
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:23,670
man.

1905
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:23,931
There.

1906
00:46:23,931 --> 00:46:26,100
And then like this
neoprene mask underneath.

1907
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:28,860
So I had like double facemask double tape,

1908
00:46:28,861 --> 00:46:30,600
like anything to just,

1909
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:30,871
you know,

1910
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,590
keep me,

1911
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:35,970
keep me more suspected that it
was so high above sea level there.

1912
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:36,930
Yeah.

1913
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:37,261
Yeah.

1914
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,550
So you've got whatever it is,

1915
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:39,181
9,000,

1916
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:40,800
300 feet at the South Pole.

1917
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:43,560
So it's basically just
like elevated ground,

1918
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:44,610
but it seems flat.

1919
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,241
Right.

1920
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:45,480
But yeah,

1921
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,650
I started at sea level.

1922
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:47,010
So you've got,

1923
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:47,790
I'm not only add,

1924
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,510
like I'm actually going uphill
all the way to the south coast.

1925
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,520
So the first 40 sub days I pulled
that sled up hill completely.

1926
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,280
So it was,

1927
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,630
I don't think freaks me out.

1928
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:01,620
Yeah.

1929
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,390
Like when you were freaking out an hour
in and you hadn't even actually land

1930
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:06,690
yet.

1931
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,510
Yeah.

1932
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,100
What does,

1933
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,990
what thoughts were
going through your head?

1934
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,461
Were you thinking,

1935
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:11,671
man,

1936
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:13,470
I need to get someone
to fucking rescue me.

1937
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,393
I mean,

1938
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,331
it definitely,

1939
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:15,720
you know,

1940
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,950
that those moments of doubt,

1941
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:17,310
oh,

1942
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:18,360
this is on Everest.

1943
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:19,363
This is,

1944
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:20,933
we get to this.

1945
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,193
Um,

1946
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,591
the,

1947
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:23,280
uh,

1948
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:23,461
you know,

1949
00:47:23,461 --> 00:47:24,390
what was going through my head was,

1950
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,160
was these moments of doubt for sure.

1951
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:26,670
Um,

1952
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:27,960
but one of the things for me,

1953
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:28,741
you know,

1954
00:47:28,741 --> 00:47:30,670
to be honest with these
projects that I've created,

1955
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:31,750
I love,

1956
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:32,770
I love pushing my own limits.

1957
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:33,131
I love,

1958
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:35,050
I love finding the edges
of my own potential,

1959
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:35,920
all that kind of stuff.

1960
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:39,430
But I also now really enjoy building
these projects that I can share with other

1961
00:47:39,431 --> 00:47:39,730
people.

1962
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:40,060
I do this,

1963
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,980
I just nonprofit work where there's,

1964
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:42,131
you know,

1965
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:45,640
30,000 school kids tuning into this
project and using this as curriculum in

1966
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:47,410
their classrooms to learn
about climate change,

1967
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:49,210
to learn about whether
atmospheric pressure.

1968
00:47:49,211 --> 00:47:50,500
That's a really cool projects like that.

1969
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,060
And then just sharing it
with the world at large,

1970
00:47:52,061 --> 00:47:52,870
people going like,

1971
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,710
this is impossible.

1972
00:47:53,711 --> 00:47:53,861
I mean,

1973
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:54,700
how many guys do you know?

1974
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:56,290
That was like one day I'm
going to do this cool thing,

1975
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,550
but they like never do it right.

1976
00:47:57,551 --> 00:48:00,310
And so actually going after
that and sharing it away,

1977
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,410
it's like you might not want
to walk across Antarctica,

1978
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:05,680
but like you probably have some hope or
some dream or some goal that you want to

1979
00:48:05,681 --> 00:48:06,520
accomplish in your life.

1980
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:07,900
Like fucking go and do it.

1981
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:08,860
Like get through it.

1982
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:09,880
And so for me,

1983
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:10,361
doing this,

1984
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:10,781
it's funny,

1985
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:10,880
I've,

1986
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,200
I've started to think of myself less as
an athlete and actually more of as an

1987
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:16,810
artist and my canvas really
is just endurance sports.

1988
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,470
But creating these art projects in the
world that I can create and share with

1989
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:22,570
people through storytelling
to hopefully inspire them.

1990
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:22,841
Do it.

1991
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:25,300
So what was I thinking
in that first hour was,

1992
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,080
you know,

1993
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:26,913
I don't,

1994
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:29,470
I don't want my art project
to blow up right in my face,

1995
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:30,700
but more so there was,

1996
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:31,990
this was bigger than myself.

1997
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:33,520
And that's really what
kept me going forward.

1998
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:36,760
Just like I can't let these kids in these
public school classrooms think that I

1999
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:37,990
could after the first hour,

2000
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:41,020
like at these other people that are
their driving inspiration from this,

2001
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:43,210
hopefully like I want to do
this for this larger purpose.

2002
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,044
And honestly,

2003
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:44,440
that's,

2004
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,320
that's what really kept me going forward
through the really hard times was that,

2005
00:48:47,321 --> 00:48:47,501
that,

2006
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:50,500
that connection to a larger purpose of
what I want to put out in the world and

2007
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:51,970
that ripple effect of positivity.

2008
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:52,961
That's awesome.

2009
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:56,170
And then of course you have a
giant team that prepared and,

2010
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:58,290
Oh yeah.

2011
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:58,710
You know,

2012
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:58,980
it's,

2013
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,350
it's,

2014
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,400
it's a lot,

2015
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:01,270
lot goes into it.

2016
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,440
So get getting to that,

2017
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,480
getting to that starting
line and having that doubt.

2018
00:49:04,481 --> 00:49:04,871
But I think,

2019
00:49:04,871 --> 00:49:05,290
I mean,

2020
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:06,580
on one level it's also,

2021
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:07,510
it's a human element.

2022
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:07,630
It's,

2023
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,670
it'd be easy for me to come
in here and tell the story.

2024
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:10,240
Like,

2025
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:10,991
you know what Joe,

2026
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:13,210
like I'm the biggest bad ass in the world.

2027
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:15,760
No one's walked across
Antarctica and like I did it.

2028
00:49:15,761 --> 00:49:17,360
Even though these people
died trying whatever.

2029
00:49:17,361 --> 00:49:19,210
Like those are the facts of the situation.

2030
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:19,961
But like the truth is,

2031
00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:20,201
man,

2032
00:49:20,201 --> 00:49:21,490
like I'm human.

2033
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,590
Like I have the wave of human emotions.

2034
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:26,620
I've figured out how to tap into my
mind in a way to do these things.

2035
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:28,480
But like I still experience fear.

2036
00:49:28,481 --> 00:49:30,190
I steer x feeling experienced doubt.

2037
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:32,080
I still experienced the ups and downs,

2038
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:36,040
but I have a way of actually being able
to repo purpose or refocus that energy

2039
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,001
into positive,

2040
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:37,751
forward momentum.

2041
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:39,190
I think that's what the differences,

2042
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,540
but I believe all of us,

2043
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:42,910
all of us humans have
the capacity to do this.

2044
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,631
Like you're looking at me,

2045
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:44,830
I'm like a pretty like regular,

2046
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:46,750
like size of the regular looking guy.

2047
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:47,440
Um,

2048
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:47,921
but I think,

2049
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:48,131
you know,

2050
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:50,320
the muscle between my years is
what separates a difference.

2051
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,940
And they allowed me to do
this more than anything.

2052
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:56,110
You don't seem to have the darkness that
I usually see and people that do things

2053
00:49:56,111 --> 00:49:56,944
like this.

2054
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,083
Do you know what I'm saying?

2055
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,960
There's a bunch of people that have done
some fucked up things and they all have

2056
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:03,490
some weird darkness.

2057
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:04,511
Yeah.

2058
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:05,344
You know,

2059
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:07,000
I hear what you're saying.

2060
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:10,360
I think for me there's a lot of the
strength comes from a dark moment in my

2061
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:10,810
life.

2062
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:11,643
Um,

2063
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,401
you know,

2064
00:50:12,401 --> 00:50:13,420
right after college,

2065
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:13,841
uh,

2066
00:50:13,841 --> 00:50:15,010
I was traveling around the world at,

2067
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:15,130
you know,

2068
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,690
I had no money as a kid growing up,

2069
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:17,140
you know,

2070
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:17,350
you know,

2071
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,000
we're working class background,

2072
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,500
painted houses every summer,

2073
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:22,090
but always dreamed of traveling the world.

2074
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:22,451
So I was like,

2075
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:24,040
one day I'm going to travel the world.

2076
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:28,250
So I finished college buddies of mine
are getting like real jobs and whatever

2077
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:29,420
Wall Street and things like that.

2078
00:50:29,421 --> 00:50:29,841
And I was like,

2079
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:30,261
you know what?

2080
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:33,050
I saved up $10,000 over
the past six years.

2081
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:35,990
I'm going to take a surfboard and a
backpack and like go see the world with my

2082
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:36,741
life savings.

2083
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:38,270
And so I went and do that.

2084
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:39,410
I'm 21 years old,

2085
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:39,710
you know,

2086
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,491
go to Fiji.

2087
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:41,540
I served through Australia,

2088
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:42,620
hitchhike through New Zealand.

2089
00:50:42,621 --> 00:50:45,890
I ended up in Thailand
and Europe at a time.

2090
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:46,310
Yeah,

2091
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:46,521
yeah,

2092
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:47,260
of course.

2093
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:47,730
Um,

2094
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:48,080
and you,

2095
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,620
so you're familiar with how much fire
and fire dancing and various crazy to

2096
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:53,330
Boucher's things that happen over there.

2097
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:56,960
So I'm on a beach in rural Thailand
and I decided to jump this flaming jump

2098
00:50:56,961 --> 00:50:57,320
rope.

2099
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:57,860
Um,

2100
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,440
and unfortunately it goes
terribly wrong for me.

2101
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:05,090
The rope wrapped around my legs and
ignites my entire bio body on fire to my

2102
00:51:05,091 --> 00:51:05,840
neck.

2103
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,470
Um,

2104
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:06,831
and you know,

2105
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:08,270
in an instant my life changed.

2106
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:08,451
You know,

2107
00:51:08,451 --> 00:51:10,910
fortunately for me the water's edge,

2108
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:12,530
the ocean was 10 steps away,

2109
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:15,590
so kind of instinct takes over
and I dive into the ocean,

2110
00:51:15,591 --> 00:51:16,970
which extinguish the flames.

2111
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,500
My Body's on fire to my neck,

2112
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,530
but not before about 25%
of my body is severely,

2113
00:51:21,531 --> 00:51:22,460
severely burned.

2114
00:51:22,461 --> 00:51:23,810
So my clothes were on fire.

2115
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:24,500
Um,

2116
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,030
but mostly we got severely burned,

2117
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:27,500
was my legs and feet.

2118
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,460
And so I'm in a place,

2119
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:29,270
I want a beach.

2120
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:29,530
There's,

2121
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:30,440
there's no hospital in this.

2122
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:31,161
Since I'm on an island.

2123
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:32,090
There was no hospital.

2124
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,340
Instead of an ambulance ride,

2125
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:34,880
I'm on the back of a moped,

2126
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,680
driving down a dirt path.

2127
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:36,981
You know,

2128
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:37,111
I'm,

2129
00:51:37,111 --> 00:51:39,300
I'm in a one room nursing station,

2130
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,370
literally like the size of the room.

2131
00:51:40,371 --> 00:51:42,530
We're sitting in there like
this is our sort of hospital,

2132
00:51:42,531 --> 00:51:46,970
it's like one bed and I'm just completely
devastated and sort of that they put

2133
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:49,790
me under eight surgeries over the
next week in the middle of nowhere,

2134
00:51:49,791 --> 00:51:52,670
rural Thailand surgeries
in a tiny little shack.

2135
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:53,301
And the,

2136
00:51:53,301 --> 00:51:56,720
basically there's a cat running around
my bed every time I come out of there,

2137
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:56,930
you know,

2138
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,100
quote unquote Icu,

2139
00:51:58,101 --> 00:52:00,680
there's a cat running around
my bed and across my chest.

2140
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:02,750
And the doctors are
literally saying to me,

2141
00:52:02,751 --> 00:52:02,961
you know,

2142
00:52:02,961 --> 00:52:03,171
in the,

2143
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:03,921
in the broken,

2144
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:04,190
you know,

2145
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:05,001
English is,

2146
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:05,420
they're saying,

2147
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:05,780
hey,

2148
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,950
you'll probably never walk again.

2149
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:07,490
Normally.

2150
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,770
Like you're probably never
gonna walk again normally.

2151
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,670
Um,

2152
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:10,941
yeah,

2153
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:11,181
there,

2154
00:52:11,181 --> 00:52:12,170
there's a photo of that.

2155
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,300
I think if you click over on,

2156
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,420
on that to the second one,

2157
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:15,254
it actually shows,

2158
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,130
um,

2159
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:16,350
you know,

2160
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:16,720
there,

2161
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:16,941
there's,

2162
00:52:16,941 --> 00:52:17,774
what the legs.

2163
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:19,010
Um,

2164
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,843
so,

2165
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,150
you know,

2166
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:20,830
I was,

2167
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:21,170
and that's,

2168
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:21,411
that,

2169
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:22,790
that photo there with those legs.

2170
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:25,100
That's actually eight weeks
after I was burned so that,

2171
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:25,671
believe it or not,

2172
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:26,400
that's like the,

2173
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,460
it starting to look a little bit better.

2174
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,030
Um,

2175
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,320
all things considered there.

2176
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:32,660
So as you can probably imagine,

2177
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:32,931
I mean,

2178
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:34,550
just the darkest time in my life,

2179
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:34,881
I've been,

2180
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:35,061
you know,

2181
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:35,421
an APP,

2182
00:52:35,421 --> 00:52:35,571
you know,

2183
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:36,860
I swam through college.

2184
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:40,520
I know I thought of myself as a physically
active person and here I am like

2185
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:41,061
doctor saying,

2186
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:41,301
Hey,

2187
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:41,481
you know,

2188
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:42,440
22 year old kid,

2189
00:52:42,441 --> 00:52:44,030
like you'll never walk again normally.

2190
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:44,600
Um,

2191
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,120
and to me that they're
the hero in this story,

2192
00:52:47,121 --> 00:52:49,940
which is maybe why you don't see the
darkness in my eyes and it's more of the

2193
00:52:49,941 --> 00:52:50,390
light.

2194
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:51,171
But you know,

2195
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:52,130
my mother is really the,

2196
00:52:52,131 --> 00:52:53,420
the heroine of this tale,

2197
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:53,941
which is she,

2198
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:56,090
she arrived to my bedside around day five,

2199
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:56,241
you know,

2200
00:52:56,241 --> 00:52:57,500
flies all the way over to Thailand,

2201
00:52:57,501 --> 00:52:58,334
finds me.

2202
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:58,911
Um,

2203
00:52:58,911 --> 00:52:59,421
are you,

2204
00:52:59,421 --> 00:52:59,991
are you a parent?

2205
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:00,201
I don't know.

2206
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:00,771
Do you have kids?

2207
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:01,070
Yeah,

2208
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,000
I don't have kids yet,

2209
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:05,630
but I can only imagine as a parent what
it's like to walk into a hospital room

2210
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:08,020
and see your kid halfway around
the world and this state,

2211
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:08,990
nothing you can do.

2212
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,350
And she admits now that she
was crying in the hallways,

2213
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:12,501
you know,

2214
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:15,140
pleading with the doctors for good news,

2215
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:16,160
like he's going to be all right,

2216
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:16,341
right.

2217
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:17,174
He's going to walk,

2218
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,420
she's crying every time she
walked into my hospital room,

2219
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:23,720
she walked in with a smile on her face
and it's just air of positivity of being

2220
00:53:23,721 --> 00:53:24,260
like,

2221
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:24,561
okay,

2222
00:53:24,561 --> 00:53:25,740
call like is bad.

2223
00:53:25,741 --> 00:53:27,450
Like what do you want to
do when you get Outta here?

2224
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:28,530
Like let's set a goal.

2225
00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:30,780
Like let's get Outta here
and do something positive.

2226
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:31,111
And I'm like,

2227
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:31,490
mom,

2228
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:32,430
you are you crazy.

2229
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,330
Like the doctors say,

2230
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:35,310
I'm never gonna walk again
normally like my life is,

2231
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:35,731
I know it,

2232
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:36,181
it's over,

2233
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:38,490
you know this and this
really dark place in my mind.

2234
00:53:38,491 --> 00:53:41,550
But she just kept at me day
after day with this positivity,

2235
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:41,701
this,

2236
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:41,851
that.

2237
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,580
And I finally was like close my
eyes and I just pictured like,

2238
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:45,600
what am I going to be?

2239
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:49,500
And I close my eyes and I
had this visualization and
myself crossing a triathlon

2240
00:53:49,501 --> 00:53:50,100
finish line,

2241
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,570
which is not something
I'd ever done before.

2242
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,270
I had swam in college but never
biked to run competitively.

2243
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:54,601
Nothing.

2244
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:55,434
But I was like,

2245
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:55,921
you know what,

2246
00:53:55,921 --> 00:54:00,270
the able bodied me sometime in the future
is going to be not only walking again

2247
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,100
but doing a triathlon race.

2248
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:03,341
And so I said it to her,

2249
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:03,541
I said,

2250
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,250
my goal is to race a triathlon one day.

2251
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:06,780
And instead of her
looking at me going like,

2252
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:06,960
well,

2253
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,291
I said,

2254
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:07,831
set a goal,

2255
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:11,340
but maybe something more realistic but
it doesn't require you to be running.

2256
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,971
Um,

2257
00:54:11,971 --> 00:54:12,421
she was like,

2258
00:54:12,421 --> 00:54:12,870
great,

2259
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:13,650
let's learn about it.

2260
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,100
Pulls out her computer and just literally
starts reading me like triathlon races

2261
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:17,551
are this,

2262
00:54:17,551 --> 00:54:18,600
they're this far there.

2263
00:54:18,601 --> 00:54:19,500
This distances.

2264
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:19,891
Like I didn't know,

2265
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:22,710
I knew nothing about the sport other
than just like popped into my mind.

2266
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:24,270
It's something I thought
I maybe wanted to do.

2267
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:25,380
Um,

2268
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,150
and so that's what I focused on.

2269
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:29,370
I literally have this photo
of me with the Thai doctor.

2270
00:54:29,371 --> 00:54:29,820
I'm,

2271
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,001
you know,

2272
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:33,780
my legs are bandage to my waist and the
Thai doctors like looking at me crazy,

2273
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:36,900
but I'm lifting these like 10
pound barbells in my head going,

2274
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,580
I'm training for a triathlon.

2275
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:38,791
Now.

2276
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:39,600
That guy's like,

2277
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,730
you're in Thailand in a
hospital and I'm telling you,

2278
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:43,260
you're never going to
walk a good normally.

2279
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:43,990
Um,

2280
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:44,670
and so,

2281
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:44,851
you know,

2282
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:45,601
flash forward,

2283
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:45,751
you know,

2284
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:46,471
two or three months,

2285
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:49,430
I finally get released from this Thai
hospital folks there for three months.

2286
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:50,050
Yeah.

2287
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:50,883
Yeah.

2288
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,960
And when I got released,

2289
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:52,950
I still hadn't walked,

2290
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,251
you know,

2291
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:53,640
I mean,

2292
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,630
I'm in a wheelchair.

2293
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,321
Um,

2294
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:57,450
I got carried on and off
the flight back to Portland,

2295
00:54:57,451 --> 00:55:00,030
Oregon land back home and uh,

2296
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,241
you know,

2297
00:55:00,241 --> 00:55:01,530
still still bandaged up.

2298
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:02,310
And my mom,

2299
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:02,520
you know,

2300
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:02,911
says me,

2301
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,920
I wake up the first morning
back in my parents' house,

2302
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:05,710
my mother's kitchen,

2303
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:06,690
the house I grew up in,

2304
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,220
and she looks at me and she goes,

2305
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,121
all right,

2306
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:09,570
Colin.

2307
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,340
Now I know you've got
this big triathlon goal,

2308
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,950
but today your goal is to
take your very first step.

2309
00:55:13,951 --> 00:55:17,880
And so she actually grabs a chair from
our kitchen table and place it one step

2310
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,560
in front of my wheelchair and she says,

2311
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,590
today you need to somehow figure out
how to get out of that wheelchair,

2312
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,140
take one step and step into
the chair in front of you.

2313
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,460
And I'm looking at it like,

2314
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:28,170
I don't know if this is possible,

2315
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,430
but three hours later,

2316
00:55:29,431 --> 00:55:29,941
four hours later,

2317
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:32,820
I'm still staring at this chair and I
finally work up the courage and strength

2318
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:34,080
to get out of this wheelchair,

2319
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,810
take the one step and get into
that chair in front of me.

2320
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:39,780
And is the problem that
because of the burnt skin,

2321
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:41,010
it's not flexible,

2322
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,600
you can move it and bend it.

2323
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,590
Now that's a good question.

2324
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:47,490
So basically what happened with the burn
is it burned me so deep that two things

2325
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:47,850
happen.

2326
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,320
One is there was ligament damage,

2327
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:51,600
so ligament damage to my
ankles and knee joints.

2328
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:52,940
And then the way that this,

2329
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:53,340
the heat,

2330
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:57,330
the scarring in the skin is healing
essentially over these mobile joints.

2331
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,760
They don't think I'm going
to regain full flexibility,

2332
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:00,300
um,

2333
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,370
at full range of motion
essentially in my leg.

2334
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:04,660
So they're not saying
you'll never walk as,

2335
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:06,960
and you won't be able to stand up at all.

2336
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,360
Although that was like extremely painful,

2337
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,120
but they just didn't think it'd be imagine
walking around without being able to

2338
00:56:12,121 --> 00:56:14,520
bend your knees or your ankles
with like full mobility.

2339
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:15,271
So it just was like,

2340
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:18,150
you're not going to be able
to have that back basically.

2341
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,261
So sure enough,

2342
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:20,160
I take that first step,

2343
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:21,150
get in that chair the next day.

2344
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:22,530
My mom doesn't take it easy on me.

2345
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:24,520
She just moved chair five
steps away the next day,

2346
00:56:24,521 --> 00:56:26,140
10 steps to let you know every day.

2347
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,300
A few more steps of,

2348
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,650
and not to go on and on,

2349
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:31,300
but basically 18 months after,

2350
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:31,480
you know,

2351
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,860
getting released from that hospital,

2352
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,420
I find myself in Chicago.

2353
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:36,550
I finally took a job in finance,

2354
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:38,110
just trying to get out
of my parent's basement,

2355
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:39,550
like get on with my life at 23 years old.

2356
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:39,700
Like,

2357
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:39,881
yeah,

2358
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:41,050
I gotta get like a real job.

2359
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:42,310
Get Out of my parent's basement,

2360
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:42,851
you know,

2361
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:43,720
move to Chicago,

2362
00:56:43,721 --> 00:56:46,090
take a job in finance and uh,

2363
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,790
try to get my shit together basically.

2364
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:49,930
And I honored that course that,

2365
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:50,201
you know what,

2366
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:51,760
I'm going to sign up for
the Chicago triathlon.

2367
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:52,510
I live here now.

2368
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:53,590
Join a local gym.

2369
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,060
Knew nothing about the sport still.

2370
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:58,690
I'm like asking random guys at the gym
like anybody here race a triathlon?

2371
00:56:58,691 --> 00:56:59,830
Like I'm going to spin class.

2372
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:00,830
Like how do you,

2373
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:05,830
like how do you like take your
shoes off and like run afterwards?

2374
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:06,820
How do you,

2375
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,920
like how does it even work?

2376
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:11,440
Like ask these questions and sure enough
through that process I like train at

2377
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:12,010
this gym,

2378
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:13,630
sign up for the Chicago triathlon,

2379
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:14,810
ended up racing the race,

2380
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,880
cross the finish line.

2381
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,980
And to my complete and utter surprise,

2382
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,480
I didn't just finish the race,

2383
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:22,060
but I actually won the
entire Chicago triathlon,

2384
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:22,450
PT,

2385
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,490
4,000 other people coming first place.

2386
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,193
So first,

2387
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:27,963
whenever.

2388
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:28,950
Wow.

2389
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,960
And what kind of training did you
do to prepare yourself for that?

2390
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:32,261
I mean,

2391
00:57:32,261 --> 00:57:32,831
like I said,

2392
00:57:32,831 --> 00:57:32,940
I,

2393
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:33,530
I,

2394
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:33,741
you know,

2395
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:34,960
I had been a collegiate swimmer,

2396
00:57:34,961 --> 00:57:36,220
so I was a division one swimmer.

2397
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,380
I swam at Yale University.

2398
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,130
Uh,

2399
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:39,963
but then,

2400
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,780
you know,

2401
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,450
the biking and running
was completely new to me.

2402
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,630
Show you how to do it or did you
just start running and biking?

2403
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:46,930
Yeah,

2404
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,710
I literally walked into
the spin class I guess,

2405
00:57:48,711 --> 00:57:49,510
but not like a,

2406
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:51,100
like a didn't actually ride a bike.

2407
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,520
So I went to the spin class and like
start like met a guy and he was like,

2408
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:54,731
Oh,

2409
00:57:54,731 --> 00:57:56,500
I've done one triathlon before.

2410
00:57:56,501 --> 00:57:56,951
And he was like,

2411
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:57,431
I can hear you.

2412
00:57:57,431 --> 00:57:59,740
So he took me out on a couple
of rides with his buddies.

2413
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,630
I had this like steel frame bike.

2414
00:58:01,631 --> 00:58:02,291
I didn't know all of these,

2415
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:04,060
like carbon wheels and aero helmet,

2416
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:04,211
you know,

2417
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:06,610
all these fancy like
triathlon type of things.

2418
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:07,810
Like didn't know much about it.

2419
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,210
And literally for a summer,

2420
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:11,680
just kind of like asked
people some questions.

2421
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:12,190
This.

2422
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,360
And what's funny about triathlon,

2423
00:58:13,361 --> 00:58:15,400
I don't know how familiar
you are with this sport,

2424
00:58:15,401 --> 00:58:16,550
but um,

2425
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:16,930
in a,

2426
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,370
in a race like the Chicago triathlon,

2427
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:18,521
there's,

2428
00:58:18,521 --> 00:58:18,731
you know,

2429
00:58:18,731 --> 00:58:20,500
for more than 4,000 participants.

2430
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:23,710
And so unlike a marathon where
everyone just starts at the same time,

2431
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:27,100
you actually have to start in waves like
a hundred people every five minutes.

2432
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:32,101
And I was the 39th wave of 53 and so
I dive into Lake Michigan and there's

2433
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:35,350
people that already started like two hours
before me and there's people starting

2434
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:36,490
two hours after me.

2435
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,080
And so when I finished the race,

2436
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:38,920
you know I swim,

2437
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:39,431
I bike,

2438
00:58:39,431 --> 00:58:39,851
I run,

2439
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:41,950
it was Olympic distance
triathlon so it was a mile swim,

2440
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:42,940
25 miles pike,

2441
00:58:42,941 --> 00:58:44,110
6.2 mile run.

2442
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,670
I crossed the finish line.

2443
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,210
I don't still know I won the race
because like people started before me,

2444
00:58:49,211 --> 00:58:52,120
people started after me and they
take the cumulative time at the end.

2445
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,060
And so I like my grandma's there
cause she lived in Chicago,

2446
00:58:55,061 --> 00:58:56,200
like gives me a big hug.

2447
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:57,250
Like I'm so proud of you.

2448
00:58:57,251 --> 00:59:00,070
You were able to walk again and
here you are finishing triathlon,

2449
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,090
let's go get lunch.

2450
00:59:01,091 --> 00:59:04,720
And so I grabbed my wetsuit and my bike
and my grandma and I sit down to have

2451
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:06,430
lunch and as we're
walking back to the car,

2452
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:07,120
she's like,

2453
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,310
do you want to see like what
place you came in your age group?

2454
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:09,701
And I was like,

2455
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:10,061
sure.

2456
00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:10,990
Like that would be cool.

2457
00:59:10,991 --> 00:59:12,310
Like let's go see how I did.

2458
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:12,721
And we won.

2459
00:59:12,721 --> 00:59:14,410
Drove her to like the scores table.

2460
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,513
And the guy's like,

2461
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:15,910
I'm like,

2462
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:16,360
Oh,

2463
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:16,570
you know,

2464
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:17,910
I'm trying to figure out a
place or what's your name?

2465
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:18,250
I was like,

2466
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:18,401
Oh,

2467
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:18,920
I'm calling a,

2468
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,270
they're like,

2469
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:22,370
we've been calling your name
over the for last 20 minutes.

2470
00:59:22,371 --> 00:59:22,551
I'm like,

2471
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:22,671
oh,

2472
00:59:22,671 --> 00:59:23,990
why did I like do something wrong?

2473
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:24,680
And they're like,

2474
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,513
you won,

2475
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:25,820
like,

2476
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,511
like my age group.

2477
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:26,870
And they're like,

2478
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:27,081
no,

2479
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:28,760
you won like the whole race.

2480
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,440
It was just this surreal,

2481
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,700
surreal moment.

2482
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,270
Uh,

2483
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:32,931
if I live,

2484
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:33,141
I mean,

2485
00:59:33,141 --> 00:59:33,500
it was,

2486
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,251
it was wild,

2487
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:35,240
but it,

2488
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:35,900
um,

2489
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,111
you know,

2490
00:59:36,111 --> 00:59:38,450
for me in that moment what I thought back,

2491
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:38,780
I was like,

2492
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,040
it was cool to pat myself on the back.

2493
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:40,161
Like,

2494
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:40,731
Holy Shit.

2495
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:42,020
Like I just did this crazy thing,

2496
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:45,740
but it was more so going back to your
initial question about the darkness versus

2497
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:46,131
the light,

2498
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:47,900
at least in my journey was I was like,

2499
00:59:47,901 --> 00:59:48,380
wow,

2500
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,450
like this is a sliding doors moment.

2501
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:52,280
Like what had happened had my mom not,

2502
00:59:52,281 --> 00:59:52,640
you know,

2503
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,940
come in with this air of positivity and
forced me to set this tangible goal.

2504
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,090
Like I'm certain my life would
be nowhere where it was today,

2505
00:59:59,300 --> 00:59:59,841
but then it's not,

2506
00:59:59,841 --> 01:00:00,410
I wasn't like,

2507
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:00,890
Oh wow,

2508
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:03,110
I'm some superhuman freak
that can do these things.

2509
01:00:03,111 --> 01:00:03,441
I was like,

2510
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:03,651
wow,

2511
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:04,280
humans,

2512
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:04,940
all of us,

2513
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:08,900
we all have these reservoirs of untapped
potential inside of us and can achieve

2514
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,210
extraordinary things when
we set our minds to it.

2515
01:00:11,211 --> 01:00:12,620
And so what it did for me,

2516
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,390
it's just sparked this curiosity like,

2517
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:14,781
well,

2518
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:16,760
what else can I do if I set my mind to it?

2519
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:17,900
So sure enough,

2520
01:00:17,901 --> 01:00:20,270
it was a Sunday when I
raised a Chicago triathlon,

2521
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:21,800
coincidentally,

2522
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:22,700
um,

2523
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,120
met who became a huge mentor and
influenced my life that afternoon.

2524
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:26,481
Um,

2525
01:00:26,481 --> 01:00:29,660
a guy named Brian Gelber who ended up
being my first sponsor and he said to me,

2526
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,550
you won the Chicago triathlon today.

2527
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,260
Do you think you should maybe
do something about that?

2528
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:33,591
And I was like,

2529
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:33,801
yeah,

2530
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:35,630
but I've got a job and
I don't have any money.

2531
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:36,770
Like I would need a sponsor.

2532
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:37,280
He's like,

2533
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:37,610
he's like,

2534
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:40,430
I'll be your first sponsor if it's
something you want to take seriously.

2535
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:42,650
And so literally that was on a Sunday.

2536
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:43,461
Monday morning,

2537
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:46,850
I walk in and quit my job immediately.

2538
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:48,830
At two weeks later,

2539
01:00:48,831 --> 01:00:49,760
I'm living in Australia,

2540
01:00:49,761 --> 01:00:53,270
trading triathlon fulltime and ended up
racing triathlon professionally for the

2541
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:54,200
USA national team,

2542
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:54,651
you know,

2543
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,300
all over the world for the next six years.

2544
01:00:56,301 --> 01:00:59,870
So it was this crazy moment.

2545
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,710
What happened ultimately with the
injuries that you sustained from the fire?

2546
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:05,000
You know,

2547
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,721
all things sincere.

2548
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:06,171
That was,

2549
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:08,630
so that was January 14th,

2550
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:08,631
2008,

2551
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,820
so to just over 11 years ago now.

2552
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:11,810
Um,

2553
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:13,040
and I,

2554
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:13,670
uh,

2555
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,060
you know,

2556
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,640
I ultimately have been pretty all right.

2557
01:01:16,641 --> 01:01:20,480
I mean I've got some scars but it's pretty
faint and was able to gain back most

2558
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:22,490
of the full flexibility in my legs.

2559
01:01:22,491 --> 01:01:25,040
If you look at my left foot is
where the worst worst burns.

2560
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,330
But where the rope really just like sat
on my foot for a long time must have um,

2561
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:31,490
that's still pretty
thick with scar tissue.

2562
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:31,970
Um,

2563
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:32,151
you know,

2564
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:33,140
when I'm in the mountains,

2565
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:33,861
when I'm in places,

2566
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:34,041
you know,

2567
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:35,150
like climbing Mount Everest,

2568
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:36,650
like I did like pulling across Antarctica,

2569
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:40,310
all the things I have to be really aware
cause my skin regulates heat not in the

2570
01:01:40,311 --> 01:01:41,540
best way he and cold,

2571
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:42,320
it's still just like,

2572
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:42,501
you know,

2573
01:01:42,501 --> 01:01:43,720
not like normal scans.

2574
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:44,540
The scar tissue,

2575
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:45,770
the scar tissue just is,

2576
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,980
it's just carries the heat a little
bit different for some reason I guess.

2577
01:01:48,981 --> 01:01:53,690
I don't know exactly why not as
porous because it's exactly in the,

2578
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:56,180
I'm actually in the early
days for the first five years,

2579
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:57,460
I don't get this so often anymore,

2580
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:59,060
but in the first literally
five years of this,

2581
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:01,370
if I bumped my legs until
like a table or someone just,

2582
01:02:01,371 --> 01:02:01,551
you know,

2583
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,590
bumped a chair and immediately
know nothing like lightly,

2584
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,060
I would usually get a little cut there.

2585
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,330
So it's just super fragile.

2586
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:06,981
It was almost like,

2587
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:07,190
you know,

2588
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,510
glass skin kind of.

2589
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:09,021
Um,

2590
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:09,311
what's the,

2591
01:02:09,311 --> 01:02:11,570
with not the same sort of
flexibility that you'd normally have,

2592
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:11,901
but you know,

2593
01:02:11,901 --> 01:02:12,201
10,

2594
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:13,190
11 years on now,

2595
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,800
I would say it's pretty much 100%.

2596
01:02:15,801 --> 01:02:16,071
I mean,

2597
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:18,800
the things I've done with my legs
and body in the last 10 years,

2598
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:19,771
I think proof,

2599
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:21,540
at least that my body is doing all right.

2600
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:22,800
So I feel extremely,

2601
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:24,720
extremely fortunate to over cover it as,

2602
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:25,740
as well as I did.

2603
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:26,431
And you know,

2604
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:27,550
more than anything I,

2605
01:02:27,551 --> 01:02:28,231
I attest that too,

2606
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:28,681
of course,

2607
01:02:28,681 --> 01:02:28,771
the,

2608
01:02:28,771 --> 01:02:31,950
the physical ability for my body
to recover in the way it did.

2609
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:32,670
But I think that,

2610
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:33,481
at least for me,

2611
01:02:33,481 --> 01:02:34,350
started with the mine,

2612
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:36,110
started with that
positivity of my mother and,

2613
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:39,270
and the duration of the many different
things I've done done since then.

2614
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:42,630
And you said you sustained ligament
damage to your joints and your knees?

2615
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:43,230
Yeah,

2616
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:43,441
yeah.

2617
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:45,150
So there was basically,

2618
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:45,630
um,

2619
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:45,901
again,

2620
01:02:45,901 --> 01:02:46,071
I'm,

2621
01:02:46,071 --> 01:02:46,501
I'm not,

2622
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:46,770
uh,

2623
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:47,090
my,

2624
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:47,200
uh,

2625
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:47,851
my anatomy,

2626
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:49,920
I have other skills with
my full anatomy is not a,

2627
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:51,391
I'm not a doctor,

2628
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,224
let's put it that way.

2629
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:53,040
Um,

2630
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:53,341
but yeah,

2631
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:55,560
basically the ligaments particular
on the backs of my knees,

2632
01:02:55,561 --> 01:02:57,780
so I don't know exactly what that
ligament is that goes through,

2633
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:58,200
um,

2634
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:58,741
through there.

2635
01:02:58,741 --> 01:02:59,250
But,

2636
01:02:59,250 --> 01:02:59,521
um,

2637
01:02:59,521 --> 01:03:00,740
that was really jammed up with,

2638
01:03:00,741 --> 01:03:01,680
with the scar tissue.

2639
01:03:01,681 --> 01:03:05,640
So I wasn't able for a long time to
fully bend my knees and flex them in the

2640
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:06,091
full way.

2641
01:03:06,091 --> 01:03:06,924
And the same thing,

2642
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:07,351
uh,

2643
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:07,891
in the ankles,

2644
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:08,850
whatever that ligament is,

2645
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,890
that goes sort of basically turn,

2646
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:11,081
not,

2647
01:03:11,081 --> 01:03:11,761
not your Achilles,

2648
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:13,260
but the other side of your foot.

2649
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,100
Basically.

2650
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,760
That part was just so much scar tissue
had formed a way the skin was healing

2651
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:18,211
around that.

2652
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,620
And from the damage to the ligament,

2653
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:21,950
it wasn't sort of being
able to fluidly flex,

2654
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:22,350
uh,

2655
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:23,730
in the way that you
normally would see a foot.

2656
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:26,790
So full they imagined point margin might
be on a point your foot basically if

2657
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:26,941
you're,

2658
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:27,120
you know,

2659
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,320
putting your leg forward out,

2660
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:28,591
you know,

2661
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:30,000
back like kicking like that.

2662
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:31,110
So yeah,

2663
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:32,460
for a long time and it was kind of a,

2664
01:03:32,461 --> 01:03:34,920
so it was kind of like dragging
my feet around in that first year.

2665
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,670
Um,

2666
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:36,240
and uh,

2667
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,330
so did you have to just push through
the scar tissue and break it up?

2668
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:39,901
Yeah,

2669
01:03:39,901 --> 01:03:41,010
I mean it was a lot of,

2670
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,780
a lot of obviously PT,

2671
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,890
a lot of,

2672
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,753
uh,

2673
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:45,653
massage.

2674
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,513
Um,

2675
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:47,120
I'll,

2676
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,120
I'll tell you a funny story.

2677
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:48,410
It's funny,

2678
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,141
I haven't thought of this story.

2679
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:50,640
They log type of,

2680
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:51,580
uh,

2681
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:51,720
the,

2682
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,160
if ever told this story actually.

2683
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:53,731
But,

2684
01:03:53,731 --> 01:03:54,870
so when I got burned,

2685
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:57,510
I've been traveling by myself
in Thailand or around the world,

2686
01:03:57,511 --> 01:04:02,070
but I actually met up with my childhood
best friend named David Boyer who

2687
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:02,520
actually,

2688
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:02,950
uh,

2689
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:04,890
re married my sister
and they have two kids.

2690
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:07,170
So my childhood best friend
turned into my brother in law,

2691
01:04:07,171 --> 01:04:08,310
which is pretty fun.

2692
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:09,451
But,

2693
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:09,670
uh,

2694
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:10,500
anyways,

2695
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,220
um,

2696
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:11,910
he had been,

2697
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:13,530
he had actually been with
me when I got burned.

2698
01:04:13,531 --> 01:04:16,170
So those first five days in the
hospital before my mom got there,

2699
01:04:16,171 --> 01:04:17,004
he was with me.

2700
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:17,440
Um,

2701
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:17,760
and was,

2702
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,421
it was a saint,

2703
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:18,601
you know,

2704
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:21,780
we're both these scared little 22 year
old kids and he's like trying to do his

2705
01:04:21,781 --> 01:04:23,730
best to look after me
and he's freaked out.

2706
01:04:23,731 --> 01:04:25,020
But when I get back to Portland,

2707
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:25,861
his mother,

2708
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:27,960
who was kind of a second
mother for me growing up,

2709
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,100
my name's Kate Boyer.

2710
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:29,910
Um,

2711
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:30,840
she obviously was like,

2712
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:31,051
wow,

2713
01:04:31,051 --> 01:04:32,070
this could have been my son.

2714
01:04:32,071 --> 01:04:33,090
Just as you said it had been,

2715
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:33,300
you know,

2716
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:33,811
her son,

2717
01:04:33,811 --> 01:04:33,961
you know,

2718
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:35,700
just kind of felt like protective of me.

2719
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:37,830
So she comes over to my
house one day and she goes,

2720
01:04:37,831 --> 01:04:37,981
you know,

2721
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:40,020
I've been doing some
untraditional healing work.

2722
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,190
Would you be open to that?

2723
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:42,690
And at this point was like,

2724
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:43,740
I'll take anything.

2725
01:04:43,741 --> 01:04:44,670
What do you guys mind?

2726
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:45,331
And she was like,

2727
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:46,000
well,

2728
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:46,220
I've,

2729
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,160
I've been working with this,

2730
01:04:47,161 --> 01:04:49,170
a pranic healing Shawmut uh,

2731
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,610
do you want to want to check that out?

2732
01:04:50,611 --> 01:04:51,450
And I literally was like,

2733
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,460
I was like saying yes to
everything at this point.

2734
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:54,960
Like I'm looking for any way to recover.

2735
01:04:54,961 --> 01:04:55,261
And I was like,

2736
01:04:55,261 --> 01:04:55,351
well,

2737
01:04:55,351 --> 01:04:55,741
what is it?

2738
01:04:55,741 --> 01:04:56,280
And she was like,

2739
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:56,401
well,

2740
01:04:56,401 --> 01:04:57,211
we don't even touch you.

2741
01:04:57,211 --> 01:04:58,350
It's just light healing.

2742
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,390
And so I go to this basement,

2743
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:01,350
uh,

2744
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:02,620
in Portland and I meet this,

2745
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:03,493
this guy,

2746
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,980
and he's sitting there with a bucket
of salt in front of him and he starts,

2747
01:05:07,981 --> 01:05:09,210
he doesn't touch me at all.

2748
01:05:09,211 --> 01:05:12,960
He's just like waving his hands in
front of like my body and my heart.

2749
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:15,910
And then he's like looking
really intensely at my foot
and I sit there for like

2750
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:15,990
an hour.

2751
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:16,920
I never touches me,

2752
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:17,291
nothing.

2753
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:18,370
He's just like looking at me,

2754
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:20,390
waving his hand in this and,

2755
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:20,801
and he's like,

2756
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:21,011
okay,

2757
01:05:21,011 --> 01:05:21,844
I'm done now.

2758
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,073
And I'm like,

2759
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:23,680
okay,

2760
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,221
what did you do?

2761
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:24,581
And he was,

2762
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:24,791
you know,

2763
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:26,170
telling opened up this shocker.

2764
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:27,490
I opened up that I did this,

2765
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:32,491
but what I mostly did was I put this
force field of white light or right foot

2766
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:33,520
and I'm like,

2767
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,160
I mean I'm,

2768
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:34,781
I'm pretty,

2769
01:05:34,781 --> 01:05:36,250
I've down with some
untraditional traditional stuff,

2770
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:38,110
but I was kind of like [inaudible] cool.

2771
01:05:38,111 --> 01:05:39,220
Like thanks,

2772
01:05:39,221 --> 01:05:40,180
I appreciate it.

2773
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:40,811
He's doing it.

2774
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:41,111
And I was like,

2775
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:41,950
what's this bucket?

2776
01:05:41,951 --> 01:05:42,670
And he was like,

2777
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:47,080
this is the salt bucket that takes the
negative energy away from your foot and

2778
01:05:47,081 --> 01:05:50,560
your leg and puts the negative energy in
there as I'm bringing in this light and

2779
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,640
says pranic healing.

2780
01:05:51,641 --> 01:05:52,180
And he's like,

2781
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:55,210
so you have this light blue forcefield
over your left foot right now,

2782
01:05:55,211 --> 01:05:56,890
which was the worst burn part of my body.

2783
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:57,341
I,

2784
01:05:57,341 --> 01:05:57,641
he goes,

2785
01:05:57,641 --> 01:06:01,120
I would recommend not showering for the
next couple of days as you might wash up

2786
01:06:01,121 --> 01:06:01,954
the force field.

2787
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,170
So jails.

2788
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:07,310
So I tell this story with the total smile,

2789
01:06:07,311 --> 01:06:09,160
a cheeky smile on my face
because that's funny.

2790
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:10,630
I haven't thought of
a story a lot of time,

2791
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:15,900
but I will say that the next day I
walked further than I had the rest of the

2792
01:06:16,211 --> 01:06:16,511
time.

2793
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:17,950
So you want to call that placebo,

2794
01:06:17,951 --> 01:06:21,220
you want to call it whatever I emotionally
was it fully bought in on the Pranic

2795
01:06:21,221 --> 01:06:21,521
healing.

2796
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:21,671
I'll be,

2797
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:22,091
like I said,

2798
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:24,460
I am into very a lot of
alternative modalities.

2799
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:24,740
God,

2800
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:25,573
I wish it was true.

2801
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:28,230
I wish it was true.

2802
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,880
I met a lady at the comedy store once,

2803
01:06:29,881 --> 01:06:31,530
told me she does reiki healing.

2804
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,950
She like Kinda rubbed her hands
together and waved him in front of me.

2805
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:35,161
I'm like,

2806
01:06:35,161 --> 01:06:35,994
what are you doing?

2807
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:36,720
She's like,

2808
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:36,941
do you,

2809
01:06:36,941 --> 01:06:37,711
do you feel that?

2810
01:06:37,711 --> 01:06:37,911
I'm like,

2811
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:38,701
don't feel shit.

2812
01:06:38,701 --> 01:06:39,600
I don't know what you're talking.

2813
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:40,440
Rough.

2814
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,490
So that,

2815
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,130
that part,

2816
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,200
I don't know if it
worked or it didn't work,

2817
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:44,761
but the,

2818
01:06:44,761 --> 01:06:47,050
the combination of the
amount of people with,

2819
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:47,680
you know,

2820
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,540
in the hospital with
the physical therapist,

2821
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:50,710
with my mother at home,

2822
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:53,080
with Kate boy taking me
to the pranic healing,

2823
01:06:53,081 --> 01:06:56,980
a culmination of all of those
things somehow did unlock the,

2824
01:06:56,981 --> 01:06:57,210
uh,

2825
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:59,550
the scar tissue and allow me
to make a full recovery or,

2826
01:06:59,551 --> 01:07:01,150
I mean it was a lot of hard work for,

2827
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:01,810
you know,

2828
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,340
a year plus to get back on my feet.

2829
01:07:03,341 --> 01:07:04,210
But I got there.

2830
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:04,501
Well,

2831
01:07:04,501 --> 01:07:09,501
I'm sure there's something to be said
for believing or at least having positive

2832
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:15,620
thoughts about your healing and making
sure that you look at it in terms of like

2833
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:16,650
this can be done.

2834
01:07:16,651 --> 01:07:17,070
But

2835
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:17,550
yeah,

2836
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:17,761
no,

2837
01:07:17,761 --> 01:07:18,690
I mean very skeptical.

2838
01:07:18,691 --> 01:07:19,380
The salt man,

2839
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:21,630
like I said that the salt
man take it for what it is.

2840
01:07:21,631 --> 01:07:22,020
Like I said,

2841
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:25,410
I'm telling that story not as an
advocate for product Kaylene necessary,

2842
01:07:25,411 --> 01:07:27,390
but I will say agreeing
with what you just said,

2843
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:28,890
there is something about that.

2844
01:07:28,891 --> 01:07:32,250
There's something about being wrapped
in the positivity that I was with my

2845
01:07:32,251 --> 01:07:33,660
mother in that moment of just being like,

2846
01:07:33,661 --> 01:07:34,050
Hey,

2847
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:34,980
like let's get through this,

2848
01:07:34,981 --> 01:07:36,090
let's figure this out together.

2849
01:07:36,091 --> 01:07:38,190
Like let's focus our mind on something.

2850
01:07:38,191 --> 01:07:39,000
And a lot of,

2851
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:39,181
you know,

2852
01:07:39,181 --> 01:07:40,570
even as I go through Antarctica,

2853
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:40,651
how,

2854
01:07:40,651 --> 01:07:40,801
you know,

2855
01:07:40,801 --> 01:07:41,640
how did you do that?

2856
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:41,851
Like,

2857
01:07:41,851 --> 01:07:42,001
you know,

2858
01:07:42,001 --> 01:07:43,230
people ask me this question like,

2859
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,320
are you a superhuman?

2860
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:44,820
And I'm like,

2861
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:45,031
yeah,

2862
01:07:45,031 --> 01:07:45,864
I'm a superhuman.

2863
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:46,950
And so were you like,

2864
01:07:46,951 --> 01:07:50,910
that's how I feel like we all have this
capacity in our minds to unlock all

2865
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,481
sorts of things.

2866
01:07:51,481 --> 01:07:51,821
I don't care.

2867
01:07:51,821 --> 01:07:51,991
I mean,

2868
01:07:51,991 --> 01:07:53,340
if you want to paint pictures,

2869
01:07:53,341 --> 01:07:54,210
compose music,

2870
01:07:54,211 --> 01:07:55,260
start a business,

2871
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:55,920
you know,

2872
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,310
sit,

2873
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:57,660
sit in a warehouse,

2874
01:07:57,661 --> 01:07:58,351
into a podcast,

2875
01:07:58,351 --> 01:07:59,370
whatever it is you want to do,

2876
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:02,520
she can fucking do amazing things like Ed,

2877
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:02,970
you know,

2878
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:04,350
having that belief does,

2879
01:08:04,351 --> 01:08:05,610
does add up to that.

2880
01:08:05,611 --> 01:08:07,110
I mean that's step one in my opinion,

2881
01:08:07,111 --> 01:08:07,980
is visualizing that,

2882
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:08,740
believing it.

2883
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:09,880
On the flip side,

2884
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:14,910
having a negative self worth or a negative
opinion of what you're about to do or

2885
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,130
a negative thought about

2886
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,580
the future can also manifest all sorts.

2887
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,520
Terrible results.

2888
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:20,211
Absolutely.

2889
01:08:20,211 --> 01:08:20,930
Absolutely.

2890
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:21,763
Gotta think mean.

2891
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:23,510
Placebo effect is a real thing.

2892
01:08:23,511 --> 01:08:24,051
We know that,

2893
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:24,321
right?

2894
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:28,460
We know that if you really do believe
that you're going to get better because of

2895
01:08:28,461 --> 01:08:29,870
some sugar pill they give you.

2896
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,730
There's a tangible result,

2897
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,530
100% if you really believe.

2898
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:33,890
Yeah.

2899
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,180
So if that salt guy,

2900
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,030
if the thing about all
that stupid shit is,

2901
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,320
if you believe it,

2902
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:40,680
it actually has an effect.

2903
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:41,440
I mean there's,

2904
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:46,130
there's a lot of healers out there that
at least on paper are totally full of

2905
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:46,820
shit.

2906
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,830
But if you believe in these assholes,

2907
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:49,500
yeah,

2908
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,730
they can have such difference.

2909
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,280
It's very slippery.

2910
01:08:52,281 --> 01:08:54,740
The human mind is such a slippery thing.

2911
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:55,310
I mean,

2912
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:55,411
I'll,

2913
01:08:55,411 --> 01:08:57,560
I'll go back to my own
experience and again,

2914
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:57,830
uh,

2915
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,990
I don't know how a femoral
are out there you want to get,

2916
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:03,380
but I'm out there in
Antarctica 54 days alone.

2917
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,400
Like I'm telling you,

2918
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:05,720
I'm doing this for this bigger purpose.

2919
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:07,010
I'm feel like I'm tapped into that.

2920
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,220
And like legitimately there were moments,

2921
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:10,971
at least for me,

2922
01:09:10,971 --> 01:09:12,740
whether I'm manifesting that in my mind,

2923
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:13,760
whatever you want to call it,

2924
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,450
that I am actually feeling energetically
uplifted by the people pushing me on.

2925
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,270
Like there were days that were incredibly
hard where I would sit there and I'd

2926
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:20,990
be like,

2927
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:21,381
oh my God,

2928
01:09:21,381 --> 01:09:22,250
I don't know if I can do this.

2929
01:09:22,251 --> 01:09:22,641
And I'm done.

2930
01:09:22,641 --> 01:09:23,361
Like boom.

2931
01:09:23,361 --> 01:09:24,230
Like I would get over,

2932
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,030
I would hit with this
serve larger purpose,

2933
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:26,841
that's larger outcome.

2934
01:09:26,841 --> 01:09:27,770
And again,

2935
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:28,604
like I'm not,

2936
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:30,500
I'm not a super religious person.

2937
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:32,230
I was actually raised on a hippie commune.

2938
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,250
Like I come from a pretty
untraditional background,

2939
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:36,170
but like the energetic field,

2940
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:38,930
whatever you want to call that or if
that's just the belief in something,

2941
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:39,411
you know,

2942
01:09:39,411 --> 01:09:40,310
the power of that.

2943
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,440
Like I felt the strength
from those moments.

2944
01:09:42,441 --> 01:09:45,470
There was moments when my body's
switched from kind of being negative.

2945
01:09:45,471 --> 01:09:45,951
Oh my God,

2946
01:09:45,951 --> 01:09:46,820
another hard day out here.

2947
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:47,241
Oh my God,

2948
01:09:47,241 --> 01:09:49,700
it's minus 25 to tapping
into those flow states.

2949
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:50,600
So again,

2950
01:09:50,601 --> 01:09:50,871
I don't,

2951
01:09:50,871 --> 01:09:52,550
I don't have perfect words for that.

2952
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:53,030
Um,

2953
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,271
you know,

2954
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:55,640
I'm starting to try to build
my vocabulary around that.

2955
01:09:55,641 --> 01:09:56,750
But that energy,

2956
01:09:56,751 --> 01:09:58,130
I think it was derived
from what you're saying.

2957
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,360
If you start to believe it,

2958
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,440
if you can believe like,

2959
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:00,741
hey,

2960
01:10:00,741 --> 01:10:01,880
there's a larger purpose in this,

2961
01:10:01,881 --> 01:10:02,241
or hey,

2962
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:04,730
this blue force fields and one foot,

2963
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,970
there is something that
if you can originate that
positivity in your mind that I

2964
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:10,430
think can give us incredible
amounts of strength,

2965
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:11,190
um,

2966
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:12,770
and then we can tap
into something greater.

2967
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:13,191
Well,

2968
01:10:13,191 --> 01:10:16,070
I think there's definitely something to
what you were saying about the untapped

2969
01:10:16,071 --> 01:10:18,260
limits of the human
potential and that there's,

2970
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,480
most people barely scratched
the surface of that.

2971
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:25,780
And if you really firmly get into that
zone and believe you can do things that

2972
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:27,224
people just,

2973
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:33,220
they really don't have any idea what they
can do if they have to because people

2974
01:10:33,801 --> 01:10:35,840
are rarely pushed to their actual limits.

2975
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:36,291
Yeah.

2976
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:36,860
I mean,

2977
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:37,100
you know,

2978
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,870
it's been said many times before I say it,

2979
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:39,251
but at that,

2980
01:10:39,251 --> 01:10:41,630
that idea that growth happens
outside the comfort zone.

2981
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:46,010
And one of the things that I've personally
thought about a lot in this space is,

2982
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:46,581
you know,

2983
01:10:46,581 --> 01:10:48,020
I got severely burned in this fire.

2984
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:48,590
I didn't,

2985
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:48,800
well,

2986
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,850
I chose the jump the rope.

2987
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:52,730
So I was chose to be a knucklehead 22
year old kid on a beach in Thailand.

2988
01:10:52,731 --> 01:10:53,451
But like I wasn't like,

2989
01:10:53,451 --> 01:10:53,691
God,

2990
01:10:53,691 --> 01:10:55,310
I want to get severely burned today.

2991
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:57,110
Like that happened to me.

2992
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:57,890
Right.

2993
01:10:57,890 --> 01:11:00,260
Which forced me through this intense,

2994
01:11:00,261 --> 01:11:01,400
tragic moment.

2995
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:02,301
But from that,

2996
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:05,570
I was able to learn of this sort of
untapped potential inside of me because of

2997
01:11:05,571 --> 01:11:06,051
the outcome,

2998
01:11:06,051 --> 01:11:07,340
because of winning this triathlon.

2999
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:11,990
But what I realized is that it's
hard to choose that path often.

3000
01:11:11,991 --> 01:11:14,550
It's hard to push yourself
outside of those boundaries,

3001
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:15,480
but things that are,

3002
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:15,691
you know,

3003
01:11:15,691 --> 01:11:17,070
quote unquote forced on you.

3004
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:17,820
I mean,

3005
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,760
let's look at something that half of
this population essentially does give

3006
01:11:20,761 --> 01:11:21,121
birth,

3007
01:11:21,121 --> 01:11:21,811
like childbirth,

3008
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:22,710
natural childbirth,

3009
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:22,831
right?

3010
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:26,490
It's been happening since the beginning
of time and that's an incredibly intense

3011
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:29,130
physical manifestation of
the power of the human body.

3012
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:29,341
I mean,

3013
01:11:29,341 --> 01:11:32,340
I can't even imagine obviously
what that would look like,

3014
01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:33,870
nor will I ever be able
to experience that.

3015
01:11:33,871 --> 01:11:35,730
But that's incredibly powerful.

3016
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,110
Or times when people,

3017
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:37,470
you know,

3018
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:41,280
are forced to go through a
cancer diagnosis and have
to go through radiation and

3019
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:42,510
chemo and you know,

3020
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:44,520
facing the mortality and
all this sort of stuff,

3021
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:45,810
people get through those.

3022
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:50,040
But oftentimes these tragedies have to
be forced upon us for us to do them.

3023
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:52,020
And so my exploration now with my,

3024
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:52,271
what I,

3025
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:52,441
you know,

3026
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:53,310
creative artwork,

3027
01:11:53,311 --> 01:11:53,701
I call it,

3028
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:55,110
with these expeditions,

3029
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:57,480
these world record projects
that push my body and mind,

3030
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,090
it's me choosing to
step into those moments.

3031
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:04,500
It's me choosing to put my body in mind
in these intense moments because of a

3032
01:12:04,501 --> 01:12:05,670
deep curiosity of like,

3033
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:07,980
what are the limits of human potential?

3034
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:08,410
You know,

3035
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:09,450
what are my limits?

3036
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:13,710
What are our limits collectively and can
my physical expression of this inspire

3037
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:14,790
other people to innovate,

3038
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:17,910
create and do amazing things in the
world and in and other modalities and

3039
01:12:17,911 --> 01:12:18,744
canvases?

3040
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:19,001
Well,

3041
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:22,300
that's one of the weird
things about people doing
extraordinary things like what

3042
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:26,530
you did is that you absolutely will give
other people fuel to accomplish things

3043
01:12:26,531 --> 01:12:27,364
in their life.

3044
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:30,430
Inspiration is so
critical for human beings.

3045
01:12:30,431 --> 01:12:30,671
I mean,

3046
01:12:30,671 --> 01:12:35,671
I draw upon it from so many different
sources from David Goggins and a bunch of

3047
01:12:36,281 --> 01:12:37,114
my other friends,

3048
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:38,380
my friend Cameron Hanes,

3049
01:12:38,381 --> 01:12:41,350
and a lot of other people
that are endurance athletes
and different people that

3050
01:12:41,351 --> 01:12:43,690
have been interviewed on this podcast.

3051
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:48,010
But there's something that happens
when you realize that people can do

3052
01:12:48,011 --> 01:12:52,930
extraordinary things that makes
you believe in the potential,

3053
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:54,400
not just in that person,

3054
01:12:54,401 --> 01:12:55,234
but also in yourself.

3055
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:55,931
Absolutely.

3056
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:56,201
I mean,

3057
01:12:56,201 --> 01:12:56,590
you know,

3058
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:58,120
God is a great example of that.

3059
01:12:58,121 --> 01:12:58,990
I've never met him,

3060
01:12:58,991 --> 01:13:01,270
but I know I've personally
derived inspiration from that guy.

3061
01:13:01,271 --> 01:13:01,810
I mean,

3062
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:02,643
he gets out there,

3063
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:02,831
you know,

3064
01:13:02,831 --> 01:13:03,730
you can't run a hundred miles.

3065
01:13:03,731 --> 01:13:05,470
Like I'll show you like
I run a hundred miles,

3066
01:13:05,471 --> 01:13:05,741
you know,

3067
01:13:05,741 --> 01:13:07,480
and he's pushing his by two extreme ways.

3068
01:13:07,481 --> 01:13:07,781
Or you know,

3069
01:13:07,781 --> 01:13:09,670
I love what he says
about the 40% you know,

3070
01:13:09,671 --> 01:13:11,260
I think about it a little
bit different in my mind,

3071
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:12,610
but like what are those limits?

3072
01:13:12,611 --> 01:13:12,760
I mean,

3073
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,330
don't know if it's 40% of people quit.

3074
01:13:15,331 --> 01:13:15,520
You know,

3075
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,900
people quit that I can't.

3076
01:13:16,901 --> 01:13:19,090
Voice comes up and you know,

3077
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:19,901
he's proven it.

3078
01:13:19,901 --> 01:13:21,970
So as many other people have actually,

3079
01:13:21,971 --> 01:13:23,530
when you say I can actually,

3080
01:13:23,531 --> 01:13:24,550
when you don't stop,

3081
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,361
you get stronger.

3082
01:13:25,361 --> 01:13:27,790
And for me in my own
story and my own journey,

3083
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:32,590
I think that final day that finally
final 32 hour push proves it three days

3084
01:13:32,591 --> 01:13:33,221
before that,

3085
01:13:33,221 --> 01:13:33,371
you know,

3086
01:13:33,371 --> 01:13:34,480
I'm videotaping all this.

3087
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,090
I'm trying to capture as much content
to be able to share with people of this

3088
01:13:37,091 --> 01:13:39,850
crazy weird place that's
an article by yourself.

3089
01:13:39,851 --> 01:13:44,020
And like day 49 day 40 50 like
I'm literally crying into my goal.

3090
01:13:44,021 --> 01:13:46,000
Probean like I'm running out of food,

3091
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:47,110
I'm exhausted.

3092
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,490
I don't know if I can keep doing this.

3093
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:49,840
I'm just like worked.

3094
01:13:49,841 --> 01:13:50,650
Right?

3095
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:51,520
But sure enough,

3096
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,170
I don't say I can't,

3097
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:53,441
you know,

3098
01:13:53,441 --> 01:13:53,901
it's that for,

3099
01:13:53,901 --> 01:13:57,300
it was at 40% was that 50% that's that
moment when I wanted to quit or I should

3100
01:13:57,301 --> 01:13:58,134
have quit.

3101
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,920
But then the strongest,

3102
01:13:59,921 --> 01:14:04,060
most amazing moment of my entire athletic
career that spans decades happens

3103
01:14:04,061 --> 01:14:05,830
three days later because I kept pushing.

3104
01:14:05,831 --> 01:14:07,840
It's not like I rested for
three days and pulled that off.

3105
01:14:07,841 --> 01:14:10,210
Like I never took a rest day in 54 days.

3106
01:14:10,211 --> 01:14:13,990
I pulled my sled to 13 hours every
single day and on the last day it was the

3107
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:14,920
strongest as possible.

3108
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,410
So I think it proves if
we can push through that,

3109
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,370
I can't moment.

3110
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:18,761
No,

3111
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:19,840
it's not going to work.

3112
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:20,920
That you can get there.

3113
01:14:20,921 --> 01:14:21,850
And unfortunately,

3114
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:22,151
you know,

3115
01:14:22,151 --> 01:14:23,920
we talk about 40% with Goggins.

3116
01:14:23,921 --> 01:14:27,130
I actually think a lot of people quit at
1% they're sitting behind their office,

3117
01:14:27,131 --> 01:14:27,640
they're like,

3118
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,150
you know,

3119
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:30,550
one day I want to travel
overseas or you know,

3120
01:14:30,551 --> 01:14:31,510
I hate this job.

3121
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:32,000
You know,

3122
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,550
I've got this great business idea,

3123
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:33,971
but I made it.

3124
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:34,360
And they're like,

3125
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:34,951
but I can't,

3126
01:14:34,951 --> 01:14:36,580
like I've got no money
to start this business.

3127
01:14:36,581 --> 01:14:37,271
I've gotten no this,

3128
01:14:37,271 --> 01:14:42,271
like when I first set off my first world
record in 2016 2014 I sat with Jenna in

3129
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:43,061
my house,

3130
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:45,130
one bedroom apartment with
a whiteboard and were like,

3131
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,070
I'm gonna see if I can set the world
record for the explorer's Grand Slam.

3132
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:50,470
Something fewer than 50 people in the
world have ever done and I'm going to be

3133
01:14:50,471 --> 01:14:53,250
the fastest time ever is coming to not
only climb Kilimanjaro in northwest South

3134
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:53,251
Pole,

3135
01:14:53,251 --> 01:14:53,800
back to back.

3136
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,030
I hadn't climbed a bunch of mountains.

3137
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,320
Be Pretty easy to say I can't.

3138
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:56,561
Oh,

3139
01:14:56,561 --> 01:14:57,370
and by the way,

3140
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:58,780
we have no money to do this.

3141
01:14:58,781 --> 01:14:59,830
We have no platform.

3142
01:14:59,831 --> 01:15:01,690
I have like 200 Instagram followers.

3143
01:15:01,691 --> 01:15:01,791
Like,

3144
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:02,980
I mean I have like nothing,

3145
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,420
but we just sat there were like no.

3146
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:05,290
Instead of saying I can't,

3147
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:06,153
let's say I can't,

3148
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,110
what's the first step to that?

3149
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,360
We literally get out our laptops
and I'm like going to like,

3150
01:15:10,361 --> 01:15:10,571
we were like,

3151
01:15:10,571 --> 01:15:13,930
we want to build this big media campaign
where lots of people follow and get

3152
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:14,411
pressed.

3153
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:15,400
Like we know nothing about.

3154
01:15:15,401 --> 01:15:16,380
We have no background this week.

3155
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,440
Google.

3156
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,660
What's the difference
between marketing and PR?

3157
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:24,661
I mean we are literally asking Google
the most basic of all basic questions.

3158
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,350
Oh,

3159
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:27,011
but you know,

3160
01:15:27,011 --> 01:15:27,281
we,

3161
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:28,510
we continue to say like,

3162
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,960
let's get coffee with our one friend
who knows something about this.

3163
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,730
We should probably get a website.

3164
01:15:33,731 --> 01:15:35,410
How does one build a website?

3165
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,120
And it goes on and on like this.

3166
01:15:37,121 --> 01:15:38,710
How long ago did you start this journey?

3167
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:39,603
So that,

3168
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,630
that was 24 when we,

3169
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:42,010
2014 when we dreamed that up.

3170
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:42,420
This will,

3171
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,110
the world record was to
see if I could years ago.

3172
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:44,501
Yeah.

3173
01:15:44,501 --> 01:15:46,840
So just see if I could set the world
record for something called the explorer's

3174
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:47,291
Grand Slam.

3175
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:49,600
So let's come and tallest mountain
on each of the seven continents,

3176
01:15:49,601 --> 01:15:50,470
seven summits.

3177
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:51,490
And before that,

3178
01:15:51,491 --> 01:15:55,150
had you done anything like that
or did it just been athletics?

3179
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,260
So I grew up in Portland,

3180
01:15:56,261 --> 01:15:57,820
so I grew up like in the outdoors,

3181
01:15:57,821 --> 01:16:00,220
but like I mean to go climb
Everest and Denali sort of thing.

3182
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:00,510
No,

3183
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:02,710
like the short answer is I'm
going to climb a few mountains,

3184
01:16:02,711 --> 01:16:02,920
you know,

3185
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,420
it's not like I'd never
been in the snow before.

3186
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:05,460
I'd worn crampons ice.

3187
01:16:05,461 --> 01:16:05,680
It's like,

3188
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:06,790
and I had zero experience,

3189
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:10,000
but like not even close to the experience
that you would think one would need to

3190
01:16:10,001 --> 01:16:10,570
do that.

3191
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:12,300
And to just break world records,

3192
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:15,700
not just be the fastest
person to ever complete it.

3193
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:15,851
You know?

3194
01:16:15,851 --> 01:16:16,211
Like I said,

3195
01:16:16,211 --> 01:16:19,210
it ended up being 139 days straight
through to climb all those mountains.

3196
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,400
Didn't know.

3197
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:21,250
Oh,

3198
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:23,560
I think we had a clip up a second
ago if something on Everest.

3199
01:16:23,561 --> 01:16:24,430
But uh,

3200
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,151
but yeah,

3201
01:16:25,151 --> 01:16:25,900
I mean to do,

3202
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:26,950
to do all of that,

3203
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:29,680
it started from this place of not of,

3204
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,090
of a believing I can.

3205
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:31,451
And then,

3206
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:32,050
you know,

3207
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:32,621
it's again,

3208
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:34,500
it's fun to talk about
the epic adventure buddy.

3209
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:34,870
We,

3210
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:35,141
for me,

3211
01:16:35,141 --> 01:16:38,290
it's actually fun to talk about what
happened behind the scenes of that because

3212
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:39,341
what actually happened,

3213
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:41,290
like people applaud our success.

3214
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:42,190
Now this is me.

3215
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:45,310
This is you walking across the ladder,

3216
01:16:45,311 --> 01:16:45,650
that's you know,

3217
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:47,000
about 300 foot hole,

3218
01:16:47,001 --> 01:16:47,834
a crevasse,

3219
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:48,371
uh,

3220
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:51,610
on the other side of it that you have
to go through to on your way up the,

3221
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:51,880
uh,

3222
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,380
the Mount Everest climbing route.

3223
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:55,720
And so your crampons or clicking on the,

3224
01:16:55,721 --> 01:16:56,160
on the,

3225
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,930
and you're hooking them on
the ladder as you walk across.

3226
01:16:58,931 --> 01:16:59,471
And if you fall,

3227
01:16:59,471 --> 01:16:59,950
you die.

3228
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:00,783
Yes.

3229
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:02,703
Okay.

3230
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:05,440
So watch this again.

3231
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,060
This is so awful.

3232
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,110
It's so awful.

3233
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,770
Look at,

3234
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:10,010
cause

3235
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,221
you're,

3236
01:17:10,221 --> 01:17:13,700
you're basically just
walking this tight rope on.

3237
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:14,743
Let me hear it.

3238
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:17,270
Listen to that click folks,

3239
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:21,800
I implore you to go to the Instagram
page so you get the full freak out.

3240
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,640
They're tied together
to those ladders ties.

3241
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:25,880
Yeah.

3242
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:26,870
Can he as can be it?

3243
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:28,700
The 300 foot cavern over there?

3244
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,391
Oh fuck.

3245
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:32,510
All this cheese us.

3246
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:34,160
Oh,

3247
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:36,900
and you're looking down
because you have a Gopro on it.

3248
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:37,281
Oh,

3249
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:38,690
he cut the sound off at the end there,

3250
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:42,110
but I go at the bear and I go because
it's like there was 50 of those letters,

3251
01:17:42,111 --> 01:17:44,390
but I was cheering every
fucking time I got cross.

3252
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,020
I was like,

3253
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:45,290
yeah,

3254
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:45,921
one more down.

3255
01:17:45,921 --> 01:17:46,330
Woo.

3256
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:47,120
Oh,

3257
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,340
did that 50 times in the Khumbu actually

3258
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:50,720
go through that section a couple of times.

3259
01:17:50,721 --> 01:17:52,430
It's a very dangerous
section of the mountain.

3260
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:53,150
But yeah.

3261
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:54,470
When about 50 of those ladders.

3262
01:17:54,471 --> 01:17:56,240
So when you went through Everest,

3263
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,380
did you see the bodies?

3264
01:17:57,890 --> 01:17:58,311
Um,

3265
01:17:58,311 --> 01:18:01,220
so I fortunately didn't
see any bodies up there,

3266
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:01,760
unfortunately,

3267
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,490
are unfortunate.

3268
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:03,050
Fortunately.

3269
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:03,321
I mean,

3270
01:18:03,321 --> 01:18:03,680
I mean,

3271
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,330
I'm not like trying to see that bias,

3272
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:05,730
you know,

3273
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:08,630
but the are they're more prevalent on
the climbing around on the north side.

3274
01:18:08,631 --> 01:18:09,890
The day that I did summit,

3275
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:10,580
um,

3276
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,413
three people tied,

3277
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:11,771
uh,

3278
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:12,800
on the day that I summited.

3279
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:14,090
So when I,

3280
01:18:14,091 --> 01:18:14,301
yeah,

3281
01:18:14,301 --> 01:18:15,830
when I so does set the,

3282
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:16,700
I mean,

3283
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:17,391
talk about Everest,

3284
01:18:17,391 --> 01:18:19,070
I mean for me is major setbacks.

3285
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:21,440
It was the eighth of nine
expeditions in this sequence.

3286
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:25,130
So I'd done a hundred days
of other expeditions leading
up to Everest to do this

3287
01:18:25,131 --> 01:18:26,660
explorer's grand slam world record.

3288
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,070
I'm trying to climb Everest.

3289
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:29,480
I'm exhausted from a hundred days.

3290
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,420
I just come from the North
Pole before that Kilimanjaro,

3291
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:31,821
before that,

3292
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:32,061
you know,

3293
01:18:32,061 --> 01:18:33,380
Elbert's all these other mountains.

3294
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:35,990
And then I make my summit push on Everest.

3295
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,520
I'm not climbing with a guide or anything,

3296
01:18:37,521 --> 01:18:40,850
it's just myself and one Sherpa who I
met climbing in Nepal the year previous

3297
01:18:40,851 --> 01:18:41,960
when I was training for this.

3298
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:45,950
And so it's just the two of us and we
climb up into camp for so ever says,

3299
01:18:45,951 --> 01:18:48,740
you know for camps there's base camp and
then there's camps progressively higher

3300
01:18:48,741 --> 01:18:51,890
in the mountains so you can get your
body a climatize and we get up into camp

3301
01:18:51,891 --> 01:18:52,251
for,

3302
01:18:52,251 --> 01:18:54,260
have you read the book into
thin air by Jon Krakauer?

3303
01:18:54,261 --> 01:18:54,860
Anything about it?

3304
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:55,060
Say,

3305
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:55,340
okay,

3306
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:58,340
there's a famous book that's written
about it where 11 people die and right in

3307
01:18:58,341 --> 01:19:01,520
this moment it's called the death zone
where you enter above 26,000 feet.

3308
01:19:01,521 --> 01:19:03,410
The human body basically
can't survive for long.

3309
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:07,910
Even with supplemental oxygen and this
massive snow storm and wind storm blows

3310
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:10,430
in like kind of out of nowhere and
we're trying to push for the summit.

3311
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:14,090
It takes us two and a half hours just
to set up our tent and get inside.

3312
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:15,560
And we know like it's over.

3313
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:16,340
Like we're not,

3314
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:18,500
we're not going to summit
Everest like in this storm,

3315
01:19:18,501 --> 01:19:19,071
there's no way.

3316
01:19:19,071 --> 01:19:20,390
So we just survive the night,

3317
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:21,670
wake up the next morning,

3318
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:24,440
still getting pounded by this weather
and actually have to climb back down the

3319
01:19:24,441 --> 01:19:25,160
mountain.

3320
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,480
So climb back down the mountain all
the way to camp two and they're like,

3321
01:19:27,481 --> 01:19:27,890
and they're like,

3322
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:28,790
well that's probably it.

3323
01:19:28,791 --> 01:19:31,580
Like you don't usually like spend a night
out in the death zone and like make a

3324
01:19:31,581 --> 01:19:33,740
second attempt and you've already
tried all these other mountains.

3325
01:19:33,741 --> 01:19:35,210
You're a hundred plus
days in this journey.

3326
01:19:35,211 --> 01:19:36,044
And I was like,

3327
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:36,411
man,

3328
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:38,030
I want to see if I can get back up there.

3329
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:38,660
Like,

3330
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:42,340
and this other guy who I met on another
team had some supplemental auctions.

3331
01:19:42,341 --> 01:19:43,880
So I had to use some of
my supplement auction.

3332
01:19:43,881 --> 01:19:46,310
So my supplies tours
are limited now as well.

3333
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:48,170
And so he,

3334
01:19:48,171 --> 01:19:48,680
uh,

3335
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,281
he says to me,

3336
01:19:49,281 --> 01:19:49,461
Hey,

3337
01:19:49,461 --> 01:19:50,271
I'm not going to go up.

3338
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,841
I'm sick,

3339
01:19:50,841 --> 01:19:52,370
but if you get back up to camp four,

3340
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:56,030
there's a couple bottles of oxygen
that you could use of mine if you,

3341
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,440
if you somehow get back up there.

3342
01:19:57,441 --> 01:19:58,274
So sure enough,

3343
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:01,310
per sang [inaudible] name of the shirt
palace climbing with amazing climber

3344
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:02,060
himself.

3345
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,190
We get back up to camp
four and the death zone.

3346
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:05,540
And uh,

3347
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:07,060
we decided we're going
to go for the summit.

3348
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:08,280
We call back down to base camp.

3349
01:20:08,281 --> 01:20:09,360
What's the weather forecast?

3350
01:20:09,361 --> 01:20:09,751
And they're like,

3351
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:10,110
well,

3352
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:12,420
it's the exact same
forecast we told you before.

3353
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,291
It might hold,

3354
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:16,680
in which case you'll be fine or it might
turn into what you guys just survive.

3355
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,830
And if you're not near your tent and
you're up on the summit ridge of Everest,

3356
01:20:19,831 --> 01:20:21,780
like it's going to get like pretty bad.

3357
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,640
And so we kind of go back and forth.

3358
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:24,391
Should we go for it?

3359
01:20:24,391 --> 01:20:25,141
Shouldn't we go for it?

3360
01:20:25,141 --> 01:20:26,400
We just decided to go for it.

3361
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:27,810
But this crazy thing happens,

3362
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:30,360
which is you may have read about this
or heard of this if you know much about

3363
01:20:30,361 --> 01:20:30,721
ever is,

3364
01:20:30,721 --> 01:20:34,680
but basically no one climbed
Everest in 2014 or 15 cars,

3365
01:20:34,681 --> 01:20:38,310
a huge avalanche killed 16 shorter's
in 2014 that the mountain was closed in

3366
01:20:38,311 --> 01:20:41,550
2015 there was a huge earthquake in
Nepal that shut the climbing season down.

3367
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:43,380
So no one's even climbed
the mountain in two years.

3368
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:45,360
But all of a sudden because
of these weather delays,

3369
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:48,420
I ended up there and there's a hundred
people going for the summit on the exact

3370
01:20:48,421 --> 01:20:49,254
same day.

3371
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:54,440
So basically traffic jam on the worst
fucking place to be in a traffic jam

3372
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,673
possible.

3373
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:56,910
So put sang Bodie and I,

3374
01:20:56,911 --> 01:20:57,211
we go,

3375
01:20:57,211 --> 01:20:57,511
okay,

3376
01:20:57,511 --> 01:20:58,950
let's figure out how to climb this thing.

3377
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,233
And we leave camp.

3378
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:00,571
You know,

3379
01:21:00,571 --> 01:21:03,360
there's a photo that I took for leaving
camp and there's all these lights going

3380
01:21:03,361 --> 01:21:06,240
up the side of the mountain and it's
because there's one rope that everyone

3381
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:07,110
works to put in.

3382
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:10,740
So everyone's using the same rope and
all of a sudden we're behind a hundred

3383
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:11,370
people.

3384
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:12,360
And if you stand there,

3385
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:12,991
wind chill.

3386
01:21:12,991 --> 01:21:14,070
Minus 40 degrees,

3387
01:21:14,071 --> 01:21:15,270
like we're going to get frostbite,

3388
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:16,890
like we're going to
not be able to make it.

3389
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,990
And so per sang Bodie and
I look at each term ago,

3390
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:20,760
let's unclipped from the rope.

3391
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,150
And so we actually decided to,

3392
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:27,750
we actually decided to unclip from the
rope climb up all the way to the balcony

3393
01:21:27,751 --> 01:21:28,091
from the,

3394
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:28,980
the south call.

3395
01:21:28,981 --> 01:21:30,780
The death zone area was mentioning before,

3396
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:31,710
um,

3397
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:36,060
up to about 28,000 feet on rope because
we actually think it's more dangerous to

3398
01:21:36,061 --> 01:21:40,880
climb roped next to all the behind all
the people than it is to risk of fall.

3399
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:42,060
You don't know those people.

3400
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:43,410
They're like,

3401
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:43,941
and people work.

3402
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:44,340
I mean,

3403
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,950
you're on Everest at 28,000 feet.

3404
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:46,860
People are walking,

3405
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:47,071
I mean,

3406
01:21:47,071 --> 01:21:49,140
one step per minute sometimes.

3407
01:21:49,141 --> 01:21:49,321
I mean,

3408
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:49,561
it's,

3409
01:21:49,561 --> 01:21:50,790
it is brutal.

3410
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,211
And so,

3411
01:21:51,211 --> 01:21:51,391
I mean,

3412
01:21:51,391 --> 01:21:54,270
I'm walking maybe two
steps every 30 seconds,

3413
01:21:54,271 --> 01:21:57,270
but I'm like you saying
bolt like pasties people.

3414
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:57,571
Yeah.

3415
01:21:57,571 --> 01:21:57,901
This is,

3416
01:21:57,901 --> 01:21:59,280
this gives an example of like,

3417
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:00,600
so you're it like the world,

3418
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:02,160
the worst place in the world to be,

3419
01:22:02,161 --> 01:22:02,431
you know,

3420
01:22:02,431 --> 01:22:02,671
it,

3421
01:22:02,671 --> 01:22:02,910
uh,

3422
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:03,780
in a traffic jam.

3423
01:22:03,781 --> 01:22:05,040
As you can see here for this photo,

3424
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:05,660
I posted,

3425
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:06,110
uh,

3426
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:06,943
that day.

3427
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,033
Um,

3428
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:08,791
but anyways,

3429
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:11,130
I get up to this edge and it finally,

3430
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:11,791
it's too steep.

3431
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:14,470
It's too dangerous for us to be
unclipped from the rope any longer.

3432
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:14,761
And we're like,

3433
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:16,650
we're just going to have to
clip in and settle in behind.

3434
01:22:16,651 --> 01:22:16,801
You know,

3435
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:18,240
we'd pass like 50 or 60 people,

3436
01:22:18,241 --> 01:22:19,620
so we're in much better place than ever.

3437
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,740
I still have this one big puffy coat
has actually the same puffy coat.

3438
01:22:22,741 --> 01:22:23,521
I use an Antarctica,

3439
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:25,230
the big like Michelin
man coat and I'm like,

3440
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:26,160
we're going to slow down.

3441
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:27,570
I better put this big jacket on.

3442
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:29,640
And so I take my jacket off,

3443
01:22:29,641 --> 01:22:33,480
I undo my gloves real quick to put this
big jacket on over me to warm myself up.

3444
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:36,480
And I looked down and
my right hand is black,

3445
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,820
like just black is black,

3446
01:22:38,821 --> 01:22:39,654
can be.

3447
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:40,350
And I'm like,

3448
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:40,921
Holy Shit.

3449
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:42,620
Like telltale sign of frostbite,

3450
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:43,110
like,

3451
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:43,650
oh my God,

3452
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:44,850
like it's same thing.

3453
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:46,540
We've got school kids bowling alone,

3454
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:47,880
got family fund the whole thing.

3455
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:48,570
And I'm like,

3456
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:49,261
oh my God,

3457
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:53,070
like I'm gonna route lose my right
hand is Jenice still gonna love me.

3458
01:22:53,071 --> 01:22:53,311
You know,

3459
01:22:53,311 --> 01:22:54,600
what's my family going to think?

3460
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,850
And then I don't say
anything to put Sang Bodie.

3461
01:22:56,851 --> 01:22:59,430
I jammed my hand back in
this big gloves and I go,

3462
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,270
okay.

3463
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:00,591
And I don't,

3464
01:23:00,591 --> 01:23:01,890
I don't recommend this thought process,

3465
01:23:01,891 --> 01:23:02,251
but I go,

3466
01:23:02,251 --> 01:23:04,920
well if I'm going to lose my hand anyways,

3467
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,700
wouldn't it be cooler to lose my hand?

3468
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:08,290
But also have summited Everest.

3469
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:12,700
So how black was it?

3470
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,590
I mean it was a lack like black,

3471
01:23:14,591 --> 01:23:15,424
black,

3472
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:17,350
like black.

3473
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,183
He was black.

3474
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,270
Did you take a picture of it?

3475
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:19,720
So,

3476
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,430
so the sun had was just still,

3477
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,750
the sun was just below the horizon.

3478
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:23,531
So it was like dusk.

3479
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,420
And I look down at this point
and on the sun comes up.

3480
01:23:25,421 --> 01:23:28,080
So I jammed my hand back in this club
and I don't say anything to per sang

3481
01:23:28,081 --> 01:23:28,361
bought him,

3482
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:29,710
like let's keep pushing for the summit.

3483
01:23:29,711 --> 01:23:31,900
So we go for the next three hours
and the whole time I'm on I'm like,

3484
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:32,561
Oh my God,

3485
01:23:32,561 --> 01:23:33,550
I'm such an idiot.

3486
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:35,020
Like I'm going to lose my hand,

3487
01:23:35,021 --> 01:23:36,520
my hand's prospect and this and that.

3488
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:39,670
And so we'd get up and we're about 30
minutes blow Mount Everest summit and

3489
01:23:39,671 --> 01:23:40,870
should be a beautiful moment for me.

3490
01:23:40,871 --> 01:23:43,780
Like since a little kid I dream like
summiting Everest would be like the

3491
01:23:43,781 --> 01:23:45,700
greatest accomplishment
of my life on my God.

3492
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,500
And I'm thinking like
just in this dark place,

3493
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:49,660
but also haven't taken a
single photo basically.

3494
01:23:49,661 --> 01:23:49,991
And I'm like,

3495
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:50,141
why?

3496
01:23:50,141 --> 01:23:52,780
Got To get like a photo or a video of,

3497
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:53,260
you know,

3498
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,730
the famous Mount Everest summit.

3499
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:57,370
So I pull up my GoPro to shoot a video.

3500
01:23:57,850 --> 01:23:59,080
I shoot this short little video,

3501
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:02,410
which kind of shows this crazy
exposure that I'm on one side,

3502
01:24:02,411 --> 01:24:04,450
5,000 feet down into China on one side,

3503
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:06,970
5,000 feet in Nepal and this
tiny little knife edge ridge.

3504
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:09,130
And of course I have to
adjust my gloves again.

3505
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:13,300
This is from the summit and I pull my,

3506
01:24:13,301 --> 01:24:14,410
I pull my GoPro out,

3507
01:24:14,411 --> 01:24:15,760
have to mess with my gloves,

3508
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:17,080
put it back in,

3509
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:19,080
and I look at my hand,

3510
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:20,500
I start going away from
my arms in the air,

3511
01:24:20,501 --> 01:24:21,340
go per se,

3512
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:22,080
Bodie,

3513
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,440
my hands back.

3514
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,340
And he's like,

3515
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:26,270
what are you doing?

3516
01:24:26,510 --> 01:24:27,910
It just so happened that the,

3517
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,800
the glove warmers in my of clubs,

3518
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:35,780
the chemical hand warmers had broken
open and the charcoal and the copper

3519
01:24:35,781 --> 01:24:39,890
filings of the chemical hand
warmers had tied my hand flack.

3520
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,660
Oh Geez.

3521
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:43,370
Aunt was completely fine.

3522
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:44,211
Oh God.

3523
01:24:44,211 --> 01:24:45,080
So yeah,

3524
01:24:45,081 --> 01:24:45,831
this clip here,

3525
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:49,040
if you play it from the top is me reaching
the summit that's per sag Bodie right

3526
01:24:49,041 --> 01:24:49,490
there.

3527
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:49,791
But,

3528
01:24:49,791 --> 01:24:50,624
uh,

3529
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:55,400
I'm on the summit of Mount Everest.

3530
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:00,230
No words can describe.

3531
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,013
Wow.

3532
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:07,700
So what did you experience any
discomfort in your hands before?

3533
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:08,940
So you're,

3534
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:09,411
again,

3535
01:25:09,411 --> 01:25:10,244
we're talking about a lot of this,

3536
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:12,080
this podcast bit about mindset,

3537
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,520
which is one of my favorite topics.

3538
01:25:13,521 --> 01:25:13,910
And like,

3539
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:14,750
just like we said,

3540
01:25:14,751 --> 01:25:17,870
you could convince yourself that
the salt man is fixing your foot.

3541
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:18,181
Yeah.

3542
01:25:18,181 --> 01:25:19,014
Like,

3543
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:19,903
I'm on Everest,

3544
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:21,350
I'm at 28,000 feet.

3545
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:23,660
My brain's not working very well.

3546
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,880
I know that the weather's coming in bad,

3547
01:25:25,881 --> 01:25:28,670
that people are going to get maybe
frostbite based on the forecast.

3548
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:30,440
And I looked down and
I see my hands black.

3549
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:31,491
Where does my mind go?

3550
01:25:31,491 --> 01:25:31,970
It's like,

3551
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:32,570
it's not like,

3552
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:33,650
Oh let me think about this.

3553
01:25:33,651 --> 01:25:37,070
My hand warmer must've broken open and
this I'm like my hand and now it was

3554
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:37,880
weird cause I was like,

3555
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:39,410
I didn't feel my hand getting cold.

3556
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:41,600
My hand like it was fine,

3557
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:43,220
but I'm on Everest in my hands.

3558
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:43,491
Black.

3559
01:25:43,491 --> 01:25:44,210
That means,

3560
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:44,630
you know,

3561
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:45,463
in my brain I'm like,

3562
01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:46,221
I have frostbite.

3563
01:25:46,221 --> 01:25:46,910
So it's just like,

3564
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:48,650
it's a weird thing where
you can take your mind.

3565
01:25:48,651 --> 01:25:49,670
Like a lot of this stuff,

3566
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:50,720
the positivity of this.

3567
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,250
My mom went to the negative immediately.

3568
01:25:52,251 --> 01:25:53,570
Like your hand's gone.

3569
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,060
It's frozen off like the end.

3570
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,340
Um,

3571
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:58,140
so what happened to the people that died?

3572
01:25:58,141 --> 01:25:59,000
Were they on the rope?

3573
01:25:59,480 --> 01:25:59,841
Yeah,

3574
01:25:59,841 --> 01:26:03,680
so unfortunately that day the weather
actually did get pretty bad in the day.

3575
01:26:03,681 --> 01:26:06,410
So fortunate I was able to get down
before the weather got too bad.

3576
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,070
Um,

3577
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:07,551
but,

3578
01:26:07,551 --> 01:26:07,851
uh,

3579
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:09,230
the people that died that day,

3580
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:09,470
uh,

3581
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:12,140
one slipped and fell down
these ropes over on Lhotse,

3582
01:26:12,141 --> 01:26:13,280
which is the adjacent mountain,

3583
01:26:13,281 --> 01:26:15,800
but sharing some of the same
ropes on the same route.

3584
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:16,510
Um,

3585
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:18,350
and then two people died
from altitude sickness.

3586
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:21,830
So basically either running out of oxygen
up there and not be able to get back

3587
01:26:21,831 --> 01:26:22,491
down to their tent.

3588
01:26:22,491 --> 01:26:25,070
I think those people actually did get
carried back down to their tents that

3589
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:26,690
night and then died in
the tents that night.

3590
01:26:26,691 --> 01:26:28,610
Some it's called cerebral edema,

3591
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:29,300
um,

3592
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,330
which is basically your brain fills with
fluid from being at the high altitude

3593
01:26:32,331 --> 01:26:33,590
and not getting enough oxygen.

3594
01:26:33,591 --> 01:26:34,580
And it's a,

3595
01:26:34,581 --> 01:26:35,510
it's a killer up there.

3596
01:26:35,511 --> 01:26:35,841
And you know,

3597
01:26:35,841 --> 01:26:37,760
one of the crazy things
about being up there is,

3598
01:26:37,761 --> 01:26:38,180
you know,

3599
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:39,110
you read about it,

3600
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:41,750
but you really can't rescue
somebody very easily up there.

3601
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:41,991
I mean,

3602
01:26:41,991 --> 01:26:45,420
took to carry a human body
down into the rescue them is,

3603
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,940
is nearly impossible.

3604
01:26:46,941 --> 01:26:48,560
And I kind of always thought in my mind,

3605
01:26:48,561 --> 01:26:49,310
you know,

3606
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:51,110
if I saw somebody lying on the ground,

3607
01:26:51,111 --> 01:26:51,561
like I would,

3608
01:26:51,561 --> 01:26:51,810
you know,

3609
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,660
some in the energy to pick them up.

3610
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:57,260
And I was actually coming back from the
summit and I was on the South Summit,

3611
01:26:57,261 --> 01:26:59,630
so just below the [inaudible] art 28,000,

3612
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:01,250
800 feet or something like that.

3613
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:04,370
And this a Brazilian woman
who I'd met in base camp,

3614
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:04,810
um,

3615
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:08,060
named Tyce who I've become friends
with your in Nepal for a couple months,

3616
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:09,140
you start talking to people,

3617
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:10,220
getting friends with other climbers,

3618
01:27:10,221 --> 01:27:10,880
whatever.

3619
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,950
And I see her lying on
the ground with her head,

3620
01:27:12,951 --> 01:27:15,650
like leaned back in her oxygen
mask off to the side and I'm like,

3621
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,311
oh my God.

3622
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:18,170
Like this is the moment
that I'm most feared.

3623
01:27:18,171 --> 01:27:21,560
Like somebody who I know is lying here
on the side of the mountain and I think

3624
01:27:21,561 --> 01:27:22,250
to myself,

3625
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,270
I've got to pick her up.

3626
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:27,260
I've got to pick her up and somehow like
carry her down this mountain and I lean

3627
01:27:27,261 --> 01:27:31,730
over to grab her and I try with all my
might to do anything and I realized I

3628
01:27:31,731 --> 01:27:33,320
can't move her six inches.

3629
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:35,330
Like I'm completely exhausted.

3630
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,320
Muscles aren't working.

3631
01:27:36,321 --> 01:27:37,310
Brain's not working.

3632
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:38,001
So I do.

3633
01:27:38,001 --> 01:27:41,630
The only thing I can think to do is I
just wrapped her in my arms and I say Tice

3634
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:42,950
like if you can hear me,

3635
01:27:42,951 --> 01:27:43,670
it's Collin,

3636
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:44,630
you need to get up,

3637
01:27:44,631 --> 01:27:46,280
you need to get your oxygen mask on,

3638
01:27:46,281 --> 01:27:48,230
you need to start moving
like please get up,

3639
01:27:48,231 --> 01:27:48,890
please get up.

3640
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:49,820
No response.

3641
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,260
She was climbing with a Sherpa,

3642
01:27:51,261 --> 01:27:53,450
another guide right next
to her and they were like,

3643
01:27:53,451 --> 01:27:55,310
look like we're having
trouble with her oxygen mask,

3644
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:56,550
but we're going to fix
it like it's coming.

3645
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:56,841
All right.

3646
01:27:56,841 --> 01:27:59,220
And I was like just kind of going
through this intense moment,

3647
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:00,110
like what do I do?

3648
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:00,741
How can I help?

3649
01:28:00,741 --> 01:28:01,730
And it's as weird as,

3650
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:02,900
you know,

3651
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,460
I'm not proud of it necessary to say it,

3652
01:28:04,461 --> 01:28:06,200
but like there was nothing I could do.

3653
01:28:06,230 --> 01:28:08,390
Like it's just the most
helpless feeling in the world.

3654
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:10,880
Where you want to help the common person,

3655
01:28:10,881 --> 01:28:10,990
you know,

3656
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:11,340
a friend,

3657
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:12,320
I mean this person had to be a friend,

3658
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:14,900
but if any human being is lying
on the ground in the snow,

3659
01:28:14,901 --> 01:28:15,320
you're like,

3660
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,240
I want to help this person
get down this mountain.

3661
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:18,021
And I was just,

3662
01:28:18,021 --> 01:28:18,920
I'm so close to,

3663
01:28:18,921 --> 01:28:19,820
on my limit up there,

3664
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:20,241
the summit,

3665
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:21,110
there was nothing I could do.

3666
01:28:21,111 --> 01:28:21,950
Fortunately.

3667
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:22,820
Um,

3668
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:24,770
she was not one of the people
that passed away that day.

3669
01:28:24,771 --> 01:28:25,000
Her,

3670
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,280
her team did get her oxygen mask on her
and she actually made it to the summit

3671
01:28:28,281 --> 01:28:29,480
and back down safely.

3672
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:30,831
She went up,

3673
01:28:30,831 --> 01:28:32,060
she ended up going up from there,

3674
01:28:32,061 --> 01:28:33,510
which to me is like another quote,

3675
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,760
crazy part of that story.

3676
01:28:34,761 --> 01:28:38,150
But it was an interesting
lesson for me in like,

3677
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:38,601
you know,

3678
01:28:38,601 --> 01:28:39,440
you hear these stories,

3679
01:28:39,441 --> 01:28:40,610
you can't move bodies up there,

3680
01:28:40,611 --> 01:28:41,810
there's nothing you can do the rescue.

3681
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:45,980
And people have been criticized for not
doing these crazy rescues when things

3682
01:28:45,981 --> 01:28:46,970
have gone wrong up there.

3683
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:48,830
But it really hit home for me like how,

3684
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:52,760
how hard it would be to move somebody
down that mountain from that altitude.

3685
01:28:52,761 --> 01:28:53,720
And so when you're up there,

3686
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:54,291
you know,

3687
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:54,731
unlike,

3688
01:28:54,731 --> 01:28:55,020
you know,

3689
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:55,521
Antarctica,

3690
01:28:55,521 --> 01:28:57,020
I was actually alone in Everest.

3691
01:28:57,021 --> 01:28:57,441
Like I said,

3692
01:28:57,441 --> 01:28:58,610
it was pretty crowded day.

3693
01:28:58,611 --> 01:29:00,350
Like you're essentially alone up there.

3694
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:03,330
Like if you can't putting one foot in
front of the other up in the death zone,

3695
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:04,260
there's not,

3696
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:06,060
not a whole lot that you can do.

3697
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:06,690
Um,

3698
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:08,100
so the three people that died up,

3699
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:09,210
did they leave them there?

3700
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:13,680
I'm not sure with those specific
people because sometimes they will,

3701
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:17,100
you can get it like a large team of
people to slowly lower people down.

3702
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:17,491
And you know,

3703
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:21,090
in a weird way it's actually easier to
lower a dead body than it is to lower a

3704
01:29:21,091 --> 01:29:22,530
live person because a dead potty,

3705
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:25,770
you don't have to worry about breaking
bones and things like that if you're

3706
01:29:25,771 --> 01:29:27,630
lowing someone over rocks
and things like that.

3707
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:30,720
So I actually believe those
parties are no longer there,

3708
01:29:30,721 --> 01:29:31,980
but there are quite a few bodies,

3709
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:32,161
you know,

3710
01:29:32,161 --> 01:29:34,110
still on the mountain in
particularly the north side,

3711
01:29:34,111 --> 01:29:34,651
the Chinese,

3712
01:29:34,651 --> 01:29:35,940
so you can climb it from two sides.

3713
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:36,774
The Nepal side,

3714
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,330
which is more commonly climb
where I climbed or the Tibet side,

3715
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:43,140
the Tibet side is known for having a lot
more of the body is still actually on

3716
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:44,970
the climbing route for sure.

3717
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:45,923
So,

3718
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:47,250
but for me on that,

3719
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:52,260
I mean that day in a crazy way continues
on because I got back down to camp four

3720
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:55,140
and I'm thinking I'm going to sleep
for the night rest and come back down.

3721
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:57,420
The mountain usually takes a few
days to get back down the mountain.

3722
01:29:57,421 --> 01:29:58,254
At this point,

3723
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:58,681
you know,

3724
01:29:58,681 --> 01:30:01,560
I've only got one more mountain to
climb to come finish my world record the

3725
01:30:01,561 --> 01:30:05,190
explorer's Grand Slam and I was
about two months ahead of schedule.

3726
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:07,140
So if I had climbed Denali
in the next two months,

3727
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:09,090
North America's tallest
mountain up in Alaska,

3728
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:10,350
I was going to set this world,

3729
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:11,760
this world record that I was.

3730
01:30:11,761 --> 01:30:13,800
And so I called back home
to Jenna and I was like,

3731
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,780
I made it like I made it.

3732
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:16,920
And uh,

3733
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,960
earlier in the day when my
hands had gotten frozen,

3734
01:30:18,961 --> 01:30:21,180
I had actually had a heated boot warmers.

3735
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:22,620
And so I turned the heat in,

3736
01:30:22,621 --> 01:30:24,120
my boot warmers up as hot as possible.

3737
01:30:24,121 --> 01:30:24,391
So I'm like,

3738
01:30:24,391 --> 01:30:25,520
if my hand is prospecting,

3739
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:26,520
what could my feet look like?

3740
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:28,500
So I took crank those
up as hot as possible.

3741
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:29,731
And so Jen is like,

3742
01:30:29,731 --> 01:30:30,121
hey,

3743
01:30:30,121 --> 01:30:31,020
like how are you doing?

3744
01:30:31,021 --> 01:30:31,741
Like you all right.

3745
01:30:31,741 --> 01:30:33,840
We've heard some reports
over social media.

3746
01:30:33,841 --> 01:30:35,280
That's been a really hard day up there.

3747
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:35,710
Like,

3748
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:35,971
I'm like,

3749
01:30:35,971 --> 01:30:36,181
yeah,

3750
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:36,721
I'm all right.

3751
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:37,650
Like no frostbite,

3752
01:30:37,651 --> 01:30:38,341
no injuries.

3753
01:30:38,341 --> 01:30:39,174
Like I'm good.

3754
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:39,871
And then I was like,

3755
01:30:39,871 --> 01:30:40,620
well actually,

3756
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:41,453
um,

3757
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:41,701
I,

3758
01:30:41,701 --> 01:30:42,090
uh,

3759
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:43,500
I burned my feet and she's like,

3760
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:43,651
oh,

3761
01:30:43,651 --> 01:30:44,311
frostbite.

3762
01:30:44,311 --> 01:30:45,240
Like how bad is it?

3763
01:30:45,241 --> 01:30:45,720
And I was like,

3764
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,290
no,

3765
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:47,280
not frostbite.

3766
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:48,750
I actually burned too,

3767
01:30:48,751 --> 01:30:51,630
like silver dollar
circles in the bottom two,

3768
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:54,210
both of my feet from turning
my boot warmers up too much.

3769
01:30:54,211 --> 01:30:54,930
And she's like,

3770
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:55,260
wait,

3771
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:56,190
let me get this straight.

3772
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:56,700
Like,

3773
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:57,630
you climb Everest,

3774
01:30:57,631 --> 01:30:58,620
you don't get frostbite,

3775
01:30:58,621 --> 01:30:59,610
but you burn yourself.

3776
01:30:59,611 --> 01:30:59,971
She was like,

3777
01:30:59,971 --> 01:31:00,301
you,

3778
01:31:00,301 --> 01:31:01,410
your feet fire,

3779
01:31:01,411 --> 01:31:03,990
like just a bad situation.

3780
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,010
Um,

3781
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:06,930
but then she goes on and she was like,

3782
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:08,191
she literally said,

3783
01:31:08,191 --> 01:31:08,851
the next thing you said to me,

3784
01:31:08,851 --> 01:31:10,530
I will literally never forget in my life,

3785
01:31:10,531 --> 01:31:11,364
but she goes,

3786
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,121
so,

3787
01:31:12,121 --> 01:31:12,570
um,

3788
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:13,261
you're in your tent,

3789
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:13,441
right?

3790
01:31:13,441 --> 01:31:14,610
You took your boots off and everything.

3791
01:31:14,611 --> 01:31:15,331
You're curled up in there.

3792
01:31:15,331 --> 01:31:15,571
I'm like,

3793
01:31:15,571 --> 01:31:15,751
yeah.

3794
01:31:15,751 --> 01:31:16,201
And she's like,

3795
01:31:16,201 --> 01:31:17,034
well,

3796
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:17,550
uh,

3797
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:19,350
I actually need you to
put your boots back on.

3798
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:20,580
And I'm like,

3799
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,450
excuse me?

3800
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:22,830
Like I just like,

3801
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:23,551
she was like,

3802
01:31:23,551 --> 01:31:23,851
yeah.

3803
01:31:23,851 --> 01:31:27,150
So we've been doing some calculating
back home and it just so happens that if

3804
01:31:27,151 --> 01:31:29,580
you can get to the summit
of Denali in the next,

3805
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:30,210
uh,

3806
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:30,780
week,

3807
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:31,291
you can set,

3808
01:31:31,291 --> 01:31:33,150
not one but two world records.

3809
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:33,960
And I was like,

3810
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:34,500
well,

3811
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,610
that sounds nice,

3812
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:38,580
but like I'm on the summit of
below the summit of Everest,

3813
01:31:38,581 --> 01:31:39,600
how the hell is that going to work?

3814
01:31:39,601 --> 01:31:40,170
She's like,

3815
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:40,740
okay,

3816
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,210
put your boots back on down now,

3817
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,770
climb all the way back to base camp.

3818
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,000
There's no time for you to sleep.

3819
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:47,430
But then in a helicopter is
going to take you to Katmandu.

3820
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:48,510
No time for a hotel,

3821
01:31:48,511 --> 01:31:49,380
no time for a shower,

3822
01:31:49,381 --> 01:31:50,940
but an evening flights
going to take you to Dubai,

3823
01:31:50,941 --> 01:31:51,990
to Seattle to anchorage.

3824
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:53,940
And instead of having three
weeks to climb Denali,

3825
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:54,930
you'll have three days.

3826
01:31:54,931 --> 01:31:56,040
But if you can do all of that,

3827
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:58,830
you'll set another world
record like ready go.

3828
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:04,240
So I was in disbelief,

3829
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:04,590
but,

3830
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:04,940
uh,

3831
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:08,260
knowing better than to disobey
not only my amazing wife,

3832
01:32:08,261 --> 01:32:11,770
but the planner and logistics expert
in running the backer and all of this,

3833
01:32:11,771 --> 01:32:13,540
I assure enough put my boots back on,

3834
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:15,220
wipe the slate clean and found myself,

3835
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:16,090
um,

3836
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:16,271
you know,

3837
01:32:16,271 --> 01:32:18,460
just a hundred hours after
standing on the summit of Everest,

3838
01:32:18,461 --> 01:32:21,640
I found myself over in Alaska
trying to push up to the summit to,

3839
01:32:21,641 --> 01:32:22,000
uh,

3840
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,070
to try to set the two world
records and not just the one.

3841
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:26,740
Now,

3842
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:31,360
what kind of recover does your body
need when you exert yourself like that?

3843
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:32,200
Like,

3844
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:32,620
yeah,

3845
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:33,790
climbing Everest.

3846
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:38,440
I would think that your body's must be
you to be in some kind of state of shock

3847
01:32:38,441 --> 01:32:38,930
or,

3848
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:39,711
I mean completely.

3849
01:32:39,711 --> 01:32:40,011
There's,

3850
01:32:40,011 --> 01:32:43,070
there's some clips of me on Denali
and those next few days where I'm just

3851
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,450
absolutely trashed,

3852
01:32:44,451 --> 01:32:45,284
like I'm like,

3853
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:46,400
like barely eyes up.

3854
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,360
I'm going to try to push for the summit.

3855
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:48,950
I'm going to this.

3856
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:50,690
The one benefit I would say there is one,

3857
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:51,980
most of it's not a benefit,

3858
01:32:51,981 --> 01:32:52,290
but I'll,

3859
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:53,540
I'll keep it in the positive.

3860
01:32:53,541 --> 01:32:57,110
The one benefit is usually in the high
altitude mountaineering you need to

3861
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:59,960
climatize so your body creates more
red blood cells when you go up into the

3862
01:32:59,961 --> 01:33:02,960
thinner air to allow you to breathe
oxygen better at the higher altitudes.

3863
01:33:03,290 --> 01:33:06,350
A mountain like Denali normally takes
three weeks to climb because you're coming

3864
01:33:06,351 --> 01:33:08,360
from sea level and to
get up to 20,000 feet,

3865
01:33:08,361 --> 01:33:09,560
you can't just get dropped off there.

3866
01:33:09,561 --> 01:33:11,990
If you or I right now got dropped
off on the summit of Denali,

3867
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:13,790
we would pass out in a matter of minutes.

3868
01:33:13,791 --> 01:33:14,390
Right?

3869
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:17,570
But because I'm coming from
Everest at 29,000 feet,

3870
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:20,060
it puts Denali into perspective,

3871
01:33:20,061 --> 01:33:22,940
not from a technical mountaineering
standpoint cause it's still very dangerous

3872
01:33:22,941 --> 01:33:25,850
and very challenging mountain and a lot
of ways a harder mountain to climb Mount

3873
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:26,683
Everest technically,

3874
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,550
but 20,000 feet,

3875
01:33:28,551 --> 01:33:32,390
my body can handle the rapidest sent a
little bit better if I can muster the

3876
01:33:32,391 --> 01:33:33,224
energy to do it.

3877
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:37,130
The physiology of my body is actually in
a better place to climb higher faster,

3878
01:33:37,131 --> 01:33:37,960
if that makes sense.

3879
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:38,171
No,

3880
01:33:38,171 --> 01:33:38,921
it does make sense.

3881
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:41,890
But then so when you're,

3882
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:43,000
when you're done with this,

3883
01:33:43,001 --> 01:33:43,300
what,

3884
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:46,210
how long did it take you to just
feel like a normal person again?

3885
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:46,621
Yeah,

3886
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:47,700
so I was on Denali.

3887
01:33:47,701 --> 01:33:50,250
I ended up summiting in
in three days and setting.

3888
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:53,370
So the explorer's Grand Slam was the seven
summits plus in north and South Pole.

3889
01:33:53,371 --> 01:33:56,580
But the second world record was just
the seven summits by themselves.

3890
01:33:56,581 --> 01:33:57,840
So even though I went to the polls,

3891
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:00,390
I still set the speed record
for the seven summits as well.

3892
01:34:00,391 --> 01:34:01,111
So seven summits,

3893
01:34:01,111 --> 01:34:05,700
131 days and the explorer's Grand
Slam 139 and then I returned,

3894
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:06,240
um,

3895
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,590
to Alaska and then home to Portland.

3896
01:34:07,591 --> 01:34:11,100
And honestly it was a good six
months until I felt normal again.

3897
01:34:11,150 --> 01:34:11,900
It at least,

3898
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:12,240
um,

3899
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:12,750
and I'm,

3900
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:13,680
I'm definitely,

3901
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:14,371
like I said,

3902
01:34:14,371 --> 01:34:17,430
I'm only about five weeks out from
Antarctica at right now and I,

3903
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:21,150
I haven't really taken a lot of rest
and recovery have been on the road,

3904
01:34:21,151 --> 01:34:23,460
still doing various things and uh,

3905
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:23,761
you know,

3906
01:34:23,761 --> 01:34:24,750
I'm nowhere near recovery.

3907
01:34:24,751 --> 01:34:26,190
It's going to take a
long time to get back.

3908
01:34:26,191 --> 01:34:26,521
So these,

3909
01:34:26,521 --> 01:34:27,870
these exertions I love them.

3910
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:28,950
I love pushing my body,

3911
01:34:28,951 --> 01:34:29,970
but you know,

3912
01:34:29,971 --> 01:34:30,201
the,

3913
01:34:30,201 --> 01:34:32,940
the cycle of high performance
is also knowing how to recover,

3914
01:34:32,941 --> 01:34:33,691
recover well,

3915
01:34:33,691 --> 01:34:35,820
good nutritional that
and it takes a long time.

3916
01:34:35,821 --> 01:34:38,640
That one took six months and I would
imagine this Antarctica recovery is going

3917
01:34:38,641 --> 01:34:39,720
to take a long time as well.

3918
01:34:39,810 --> 01:34:44,430
Now when you say it took six months or
are you monitoring your physiological

3919
01:34:44,431 --> 01:34:45,031
levels,

3920
01:34:45,031 --> 01:34:48,300
what are you monitoring and how do
you find out like where you're at?

3921
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:48,831
Yeah.

3922
01:34:48,831 --> 01:34:51,460
So I started to do a lot of bloodwork.

3923
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,480
Actually early on in my triathlon career.

3924
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:53,901
I,

3925
01:34:53,901 --> 01:34:54,440
um,

3926
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:54,920
you know,

3927
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,530
actually early on in my professional
triathlon cry mentioned I moved to

3928
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:58,760
Australia not long after,

3929
01:34:58,761 --> 01:34:59,001
you know,

3930
01:34:59,001 --> 01:35:01,370
turning pro and coming out
of the gate with this win.

3931
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:05,420
And I had the opportunity to go train
with some of the best triathletes in the

3932
01:35:05,421 --> 01:35:05,991
world was actually,

3933
01:35:05,991 --> 01:35:06,480
you know,

3934
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,390
a couple of world champion
is a group of 15 of us,

3935
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:09,770
a couple of world champions,

3936
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:10,880
so female Ironman,

3937
01:35:10,881 --> 01:35:11,714
world champion,

3938
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,070
a couple of Olympic medalist,

3939
01:35:13,071 --> 01:35:14,180
I mean some of the top
people in the world.

3940
01:35:14,181 --> 01:35:16,940
And I'm just like up and
coming professional triathlete.

3941
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,910
And I think it's so cool that I'm
like training with the best guys.

3942
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:20,450
I mean,

3943
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:20,651
you know,

3944
01:35:20,651 --> 01:35:21,201
it'd be like,

3945
01:35:21,201 --> 01:35:21,570
you know,

3946
01:35:21,570 --> 01:35:24,280
a guy that just gets into the UFC and
all of a sudden he's training with the,

3947
01:35:24,281 --> 01:35:24,471
you know,

3948
01:35:24,471 --> 01:35:24,591
the,

3949
01:35:24,591 --> 01:35:25,550
the top contenders,

3950
01:35:25,551 --> 01:35:26,150
the title guys.

3951
01:35:26,150 --> 01:35:27,710
And like I wanted to
really roll hard with them.

3952
01:35:27,711 --> 01:35:31,100
And so I was training super hard
to try to keep up with the guys,

3953
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:31,970
the best guys.

3954
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:36,470
And I had an amazing month and then I
completely fell apart because their level

3955
01:35:36,471 --> 01:35:37,130
of training,

3956
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:40,400
we're true worldclass level and I'm
starting out was just too much for me.

3957
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,170
And so when crashed my entire system,

3958
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:46,520
my testosterone drops to that
level of a 90 year old man.

3959
01:35:46,521 --> 01:35:46,731
I mean,

3960
01:35:46,731 --> 01:35:47,091
I was like,

3961
01:35:47,091 --> 01:35:50,000
had no testosterone in
my body and you know,

3962
01:35:50,001 --> 01:35:51,830
went through some serious overtraining,

3963
01:35:51,831 --> 01:35:52,521
which as you know,

3964
01:35:52,521 --> 01:35:53,060
like it's,

3965
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:53,900
that's no joke.

3966
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,153
Um,

3967
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:57,110
learn that lesson the hard way.

3968
01:35:57,380 --> 01:36:00,200
And that was one of the darkest
moments of my athletic career,

3969
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:02,750
but it's also been a net
benefit for me as I've gone,

3970
01:36:02,751 --> 01:36:02,871
you know,

3971
01:36:02,871 --> 01:36:05,510
that was back in 2011 or whatever.

3972
01:36:05,690 --> 01:36:06,210
And these products,

3973
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:08,510
these world record projects had
been in the last couple of years.

3974
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:09,830
And so I learned from that,

3975
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:10,071
you know,

3976
01:36:10,071 --> 01:36:14,180
taking it way too much and not learning
how to recover to implementing things in

3977
01:36:14,181 --> 01:36:14,320
my,

3978
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,100
so your question about what did I monitor?

3979
01:36:16,101 --> 01:36:16,281
You know,

3980
01:36:16,281 --> 01:36:18,410
resting heart rate is one
that I monitored a lot.

3981
01:36:18,411 --> 01:36:19,940
Heart rate variability as well.

3982
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:20,690
Um,

3983
01:36:20,690 --> 01:36:22,430
as well as certain blood levels,

3984
01:36:22,431 --> 01:36:24,590
of course around the
whole endocrine system,

3985
01:36:24,591 --> 01:36:26,060
the testosterone levels,

3986
01:36:26,061 --> 01:36:26,640
the,

3987
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:26,840
you know,

3988
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:28,520
different hormone levels
and things like that.

3989
01:36:28,521 --> 01:36:29,450
So coming back,

3990
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,370
I do blood work ahead of time,

3991
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:34,760
then come back just it with
standard process with the
nutrition company that had

3992
01:36:34,761 --> 01:36:35,600
all this blood work on me.

3993
01:36:35,601 --> 01:36:38,600
So when I left Antarctica
before flying home beef,

3994
01:36:38,650 --> 01:36:38,880
you know,

3995
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,600
next place I had to go actually was
to New York to do the today show,

3996
01:36:41,601 --> 01:36:44,420
which was a whole weird thing after being
alone in Antarctica to have this type

3997
01:36:44,421 --> 01:36:45,440
of TV cameras your face,

3998
01:36:45,441 --> 01:36:47,540
that's a whole other like
weird twilight zone moment.

3999
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:49,250
But before I even did that,

4000
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:52,490
I flew to Charlotte where their nutrition
innovation center is and did all my

4001
01:36:52,491 --> 01:36:52,971
blood work.

4002
01:36:52,971 --> 01:36:56,030
And so we can have basically this
longitudinal study of my blood work to

4003
01:36:56,031 --> 01:36:56,864
understand it.

4004
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:59,720
And so I monitor all of that and
figure out what I'm deficient in,

4005
01:36:59,721 --> 01:37:00,351
what I need,

4006
01:37:00,351 --> 01:37:01,430
where my heart rate's at.

4007
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:02,150
Um,

4008
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:02,781
and uh,

4009
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:02,961
you know,

4010
01:37:02,961 --> 01:37:05,810
basically a lot of inflammation in my
body and needing to kind of rid my body of

4011
01:37:05,811 --> 01:37:06,830
that and fully recover.

4012
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:09,930
So when you're coming back from
all these summits and all these,

4013
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:11,610
this time at altitude,

4014
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:16,850
what has actually happened to your body
that causes you to be really depleted

4015
01:37:17,731 --> 01:37:18,570
for six months?

4016
01:37:18,571 --> 01:37:18,971
Like what,

4017
01:37:18,971 --> 01:37:19,380
what's,

4018
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:23,130
what's happening other than the
fact that you were at high altitude,

4019
01:37:23,131 --> 01:37:24,000
low oxygen,

4020
01:37:24,001 --> 01:37:25,200
like what's taking place?

4021
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:28,250
So one of the things that happened to
high altitude that you don't really think

4022
01:37:28,251 --> 01:37:28,911
about too much,

4023
01:37:28,911 --> 01:37:30,860
which is your body's not getting,

4024
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:34,790
so the air actually has just as much
oxygen in it as it does at sea level.

4025
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:36,110
But the air is less dense.

4026
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,970
So that means as you breathe in the air,

4027
01:37:37,971 --> 01:37:40,400
you're literally getting
less oxygen into your blood.

4028
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:41,300
It's less dense,

4029
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:42,163
it's less dense,

4030
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:44,330
less nitrogen and the pressure changes,

4031
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:44,811
right?

4032
01:37:44,811 --> 01:37:46,850
So at the high altitude is actually
the pressure that's changing.

4033
01:37:46,851 --> 01:37:48,080
It's not less oxygen,

4034
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:49,400
there's just as much oxygen,

4035
01:37:49,401 --> 01:37:50,510
but in a less dense form.

4036
01:37:50,511 --> 01:37:52,160
So in the same volume of breath,

4037
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:54,790
you're getting less actual
o two into your blood.

4038
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:56,100
What you going to higher altitude,

4039
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,233
I guess.

4040
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:57,690
Uh,

4041
01:37:57,690 --> 01:37:58,730
carbon dioxide.

4042
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:59,380
Is that right?

4043
01:37:59,380 --> 01:37:59,790
Yeah.

4044
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:00,421
I'm not a doctor.

4045
01:38:00,421 --> 01:38:01,254
Like I said,

4046
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:03,210
all I know is you're getting less oxygen.

4047
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:05,430
You're getting less oxygen in your body.

4048
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:08,760
So what ends up happening is your
muscles of course need oxygen to perform.

4049
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:10,530
So normally if I'm in a,

4050
01:38:10,531 --> 01:38:10,920
you know,

4051
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,840
when I'm in my most elite physical shape,

4052
01:38:12,841 --> 01:38:12,991
you know,

4053
01:38:12,991 --> 01:38:15,330
I have resting heart rate during
a professional triathlon career,

4054
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:16,860
like 35 getting out of bed,

4055
01:38:16,861 --> 01:38:17,011
you know,

4056
01:38:17,011 --> 01:38:19,740
38 low enough that if you weren't a
professional athlete and you went to a

4057
01:38:19,741 --> 01:38:20,910
doctor with a heart rate at 35,

4058
01:38:20,911 --> 01:38:21,241
they'd be like,

4059
01:38:21,241 --> 01:38:21,691
oh my God,

4060
01:38:21,691 --> 01:38:22,381
like you're going to die.

4061
01:38:22,381 --> 01:38:23,101
There's something wrong with you.

4062
01:38:23,101 --> 01:38:26,430
But like that's also a key
marker of elite performance.

4063
01:38:26,431 --> 01:38:26,641
You know,

4064
01:38:26,641 --> 01:38:27,474
that of course.

4065
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:28,380
Um,

4066
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:29,340
but uh,

4067
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:33,900
what happens is your body can't PR
your body's getting so little auction,

4068
01:38:33,901 --> 01:38:35,370
even as your blood is a climatizing,

4069
01:38:35,371 --> 01:38:37,890
you're sleeping with a resting
heart rate at altitude on Everest,

4070
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:39,750
like 9,000 beats per minute.

4071
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:40,883
So,

4072
01:38:40,910 --> 01:38:41,190
you know,

4073
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:42,840
that's pretty elevated heart rate,

4074
01:38:42,841 --> 01:38:44,190
24 hours a day.

4075
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:44,461
And for,

4076
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:44,941
in my case,

4077
01:38:44,941 --> 01:38:46,740
for 139 days straight.

4078
01:38:46,741 --> 01:38:48,630
So essentially you're just your heart.

4079
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:51,630
It's just like Cookeaqua even at rest.

4080
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:54,390
And so what that does to
your body in terms of,

4081
01:38:54,391 --> 01:38:54,581
you know,

4082
01:38:54,581 --> 01:38:56,100
it throws your hormones around it.

4083
01:38:56,101 --> 01:38:57,570
Obviously you lose body weight,

4084
01:38:57,571 --> 01:38:58,171
body fat,

4085
01:38:58,171 --> 01:38:59,670
body composition changes,

4086
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:01,950
all of those things
really shift and happen,

4087
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:02,251
uh,

4088
01:39:02,251 --> 01:39:03,480
in a pretty intense way.

4089
01:39:03,481 --> 01:39:04,350
So coming back,

4090
01:39:04,351 --> 01:39:06,210
like actually just getting
your heart rate back down,

4091
01:39:06,211 --> 01:39:06,910
getting your,

4092
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:07,271
you know,

4093
01:39:07,271 --> 01:39:11,760
a parasympathetic nervous system to just
relax and stress free and all that kind

4094
01:39:11,761 --> 01:39:11,980
of stuff.

4095
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:13,050
It takes a while for sure.

4096
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:16,740
So what do you do to help yourself
recover when you come back?

4097
01:39:16,741 --> 01:39:19,770
Cause there's specific kinds of food that
you eat or supplements that you take.

4098
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:20,580
Um,

4099
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:21,413
you know,

4100
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:24,270
I'll start with a few different
things that I find to be the work.

4101
01:39:24,271 --> 01:39:24,481
Well,

4102
01:39:24,481 --> 01:39:25,530
one sleep.

4103
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:25,831
I mean,

4104
01:39:25,831 --> 01:39:29,310
I think that sleep in our culture
in general is really underrated.

4105
01:39:29,311 --> 01:39:29,761
I think,

4106
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:30,031
you know,

4107
01:39:30,031 --> 01:39:32,460
if you go in the corporate
world and everyone's like,

4108
01:39:32,461 --> 01:39:33,930
I pulled this all night or I work,

4109
01:39:33,931 --> 01:39:34,081
you know,

4110
01:39:34,081 --> 01:39:35,580
120 hours a week,

4111
01:39:35,581 --> 01:39:36,750
I this I that or whatever.

4112
01:39:36,751 --> 01:39:37,290
Like,

4113
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:37,620
you know,

4114
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:40,110
I'm telling you a story about pushing
through the night and going 32 hours

4115
01:39:40,111 --> 01:39:40,321
straight.

4116
01:39:40,321 --> 01:39:42,540
There was a time and a place
for big pushes without sleep.

4117
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:46,410
But like we are not built to
do that sustainably in any way,

4118
01:39:46,411 --> 01:39:46,981
shape or form.

4119
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:47,791
So in my training,

4120
01:39:47,791 --> 01:39:48,870
when I'm training for these things,

4121
01:39:48,871 --> 01:39:49,890
I prioritize sleep,

4122
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:51,420
I prioritize taking a nap,

4123
01:39:51,421 --> 01:39:52,650
the same thing when I'm recovering.

4124
01:39:52,651 --> 01:39:55,140
So really making sure I get
that sleep is the most for me,

4125
01:39:55,141 --> 01:39:56,430
the most natural way to recover.

4126
01:39:56,431 --> 01:39:58,350
And top of that soft tissue work.

4127
01:39:58,351 --> 01:40:01,710
I'm a huge believer in massage
as well as chiropractor.

4128
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:01,940
Uh,

4129
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:05,100
I've been going to a chiropractor since
I was a little kid and to me that makes

4130
01:40:05,101 --> 01:40:07,110
a big difference just to
have everything in alignment,

4131
01:40:07,111 --> 01:40:07,831
everything kind of,

4132
01:40:07,831 --> 01:40:08,040
you know,

4133
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:08,880
working well,

4134
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:09,340
uh,

4135
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:10,440
officially in my body.

4136
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:10,951
Um,

4137
01:40:10,951 --> 01:40:11,191
and then,

4138
01:40:11,191 --> 01:40:11,371
yeah,

4139
01:40:11,371 --> 01:40:11,941
supplements,

4140
01:40:11,941 --> 01:40:12,360
you know,

4141
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,890
definitely reducing inflammation.

4142
01:40:13,891 --> 01:40:14,371
So for me,

4143
01:40:14,371 --> 01:40:15,510
gut health is huge.

4144
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:15,811
Um,

4145
01:40:15,811 --> 01:40:17,130
so getting those probiotics,

4146
01:40:17,131 --> 01:40:18,090
getting the right stuff in,

4147
01:40:18,091 --> 01:40:18,600
you know,

4148
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:19,351
it's easy to have,

4149
01:40:19,351 --> 01:40:19,501
you know,

4150
01:40:19,501 --> 01:40:22,020
that leaky gut or things where
you're not getting nutrition,

4151
01:40:22,021 --> 01:40:22,560
observe,

4152
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,760
absorbed properly.

4153
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,620
And I think we all in various states,

4154
01:40:25,621 --> 01:40:25,950
you know,

4155
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:26,701
you deal with that,

4156
01:40:26,701 --> 01:40:26,921
you know,

4157
01:40:26,921 --> 01:40:28,560
in the standard American Diet for sure.

4158
01:40:28,561 --> 01:40:30,090
We're leads to that for a lot of people.

4159
01:40:30,330 --> 01:40:30,601
Um,

4160
01:40:30,601 --> 01:40:32,460
so getting that nutrition clean and right.

4161
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:32,941
Um,

4162
01:40:32,941 --> 01:40:33,211
so yeah,

4163
01:40:33,211 --> 01:40:33,631
sleep,

4164
01:40:33,631 --> 01:40:33,931
rest,

4165
01:40:33,931 --> 01:40:34,381
recovery,

4166
01:40:34,381 --> 01:40:35,130
nutrition.

4167
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:35,580
Um,

4168
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:35,911
and then,

4169
01:40:35,911 --> 01:40:36,091
you know,

4170
01:40:36,091 --> 01:40:37,380
I've definitely been taking,

4171
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:38,860
taken a lot of supplements
through my life.

4172
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,670
I err more towards the whole
food supplements these days,

4173
01:40:41,671 --> 01:40:42,410
but I find,

4174
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:42,570
you know,

4175
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:45,060
things like Tumeric that
really reduce inflammation.

4176
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,110
Um,

4177
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:46,621
and uh,

4178
01:40:46,621 --> 01:40:46,801
you know,

4179
01:40:46,801 --> 01:40:48,570
magnesium definitely helps a lot.

4180
01:40:48,571 --> 01:40:49,980
So there's a few things that I,

4181
01:40:49,981 --> 01:40:50,910
that I take daily,

4182
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:51,691
but a really,

4183
01:40:51,691 --> 01:40:54,970
I think sleep and a clean
diet will goes a long way.

4184
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:55,750
Um,

4185
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:56,050
I,

4186
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:56,590
you know,

4187
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:57,820
mess with some cryo before.

4188
01:40:57,821 --> 01:40:58,940
I find that to be pretty,

4189
01:40:58,941 --> 01:40:59,441
pretty good.

4190
01:40:59,441 --> 01:41:00,280
I didn't do that a lot,

4191
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:01,540
but I've done that in
the last couple of years,

4192
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:01,931
a bit.

4193
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:03,280
So various things.

4194
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:03,700
Um,

4195
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:04,210
but yeah,

4196
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:04,510
for me,

4197
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:04,811
sleep,

4198
01:41:04,811 --> 01:41:05,051
diet,

4199
01:41:05,051 --> 01:41:07,060
nutrition is the key to recovery.

4200
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:10,180
And what kind of foods do you
do when you say eating clean?

4201
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:11,073
Yeah,

4202
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,540
a particular way of eating.

4203
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:14,523
I'm uh,

4204
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:15,610
I'm recently,

4205
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:16,533
uh,

4206
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:18,220
doing more of a pescatarian diet.

4207
01:41:18,221 --> 01:41:18,631
So I,

4208
01:41:18,631 --> 01:41:19,810
I've mostly cut out meat,

4209
01:41:19,811 --> 01:41:20,740
although that's very,

4210
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:21,970
I was raised that way.

4211
01:41:21,971 --> 01:41:24,190
My parents have been vegetarians forever.

4212
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:24,940
Um,

4213
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:25,930
well I should say pescatarian,

4214
01:41:25,931 --> 01:41:26,280
so they,

4215
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:27,340
they eat some fish.

4216
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:27,880
Um,

4217
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:28,440
but no,

4218
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:28,691
you know,

4219
01:41:28,691 --> 01:41:29,261
no chicken,

4220
01:41:29,261 --> 01:41:29,681
no beef,

4221
01:41:29,681 --> 01:41:30,340
none of that.

4222
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:30,670
Um,

4223
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:30,971
for me,

4224
01:41:30,971 --> 01:41:31,900
I've actually,

4225
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:33,490
even in Antarctica there was some,

4226
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:34,170
uh,

4227
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:35,260
in my freeze dried meals,

4228
01:41:35,261 --> 01:41:35,531
there was,

4229
01:41:35,531 --> 01:41:35,681
you know,

4230
01:41:35,681 --> 01:41:37,240
beef and chicken and stuff like that.

4231
01:41:37,241 --> 01:41:40,330
So it's not something I've out my dad
freeze dried meals as well as bringing

4232
01:41:40,331 --> 01:41:41,710
those column bars with the main thing.

4233
01:41:41,711 --> 01:41:44,560
But every dinner I had one freeze
tribe meal at the end of the day.

4234
01:41:44,561 --> 01:41:45,880
That was an extra thousand calories.

4235
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:47,861
Exactly.

4236
01:41:47,861 --> 01:41:48,061
Yeah.

4237
01:41:48,061 --> 01:41:49,190
It was a company who was Al Pioneer,

4238
01:41:49,191 --> 01:41:50,830
but same thing as a
mountain house basically.

4239
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:51,250
Um,

4240
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:54,070
so it was rice noodles
mixed with chicken or beef.

4241
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:55,180
But,

4242
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:55,511
um,

4243
01:41:55,511 --> 01:41:56,370
when I say he can clean,

4244
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:58,450
I mostly mean just like
eating a whole food stuff,

4245
01:41:58,480 --> 01:41:59,313
like not eating,

4246
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:01,450
not eating processed crap,

4247
01:42:01,451 --> 01:42:02,380
refined sugars,

4248
01:42:02,381 --> 01:42:02,981
that kind of stuff.

4249
01:42:02,981 --> 01:42:03,191
I mean,

4250
01:42:03,191 --> 01:42:03,480
I'm,

4251
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:04,660
I'm a normal human being,

4252
01:42:04,661 --> 01:42:08,050
so I'm guilty of that as anyone from time
to time of just grabbing the easiest,

4253
01:42:08,051 --> 01:42:08,884
closest thing.

4254
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:09,640
Um,

4255
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:10,331
but like I said,

4256
01:42:10,331 --> 01:42:10,750
my dad,

4257
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:12,120
my dad's an organic farmer.

4258
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:12,500
My mom,

4259
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:15,970
my stepdad started a chain of natural
foods grocery stores when I was a kid.

4260
01:42:15,971 --> 01:42:17,230
So I was really raised around,

4261
01:42:17,231 --> 01:42:17,790
you know,

4262
01:42:17,790 --> 01:42:17,980
you know,

4263
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:18,191
in the,

4264
01:42:18,191 --> 01:42:21,130
in a sort of hippie co op days
of the natural foods movement,

4265
01:42:21,131 --> 01:42:24,520
which of course now with Amazon owning
whole foods is to do a lot more to the

4266
01:42:24,521 --> 01:42:25,354
mainstream.

4267
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:26,050
Um,

4268
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:26,441
but,

4269
01:42:26,441 --> 01:42:26,711
uh,

4270
01:42:26,711 --> 01:42:26,921
you know,

4271
01:42:26,921 --> 01:42:28,450
that was what I was raised around and,

4272
01:42:28,451 --> 01:42:28,750
you know,

4273
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:30,790
eating Keenwa Rice,

4274
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:31,630
Kale,

4275
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:31,901
you know,

4276
01:42:31,901 --> 01:42:32,141
that,

4277
01:42:32,141 --> 01:42:33,160
those kinds of things,

4278
01:42:33,161 --> 01:42:33,401
you know,

4279
01:42:33,401 --> 01:42:34,000
beans,

4280
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:34,300
you know,

4281
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:35,370
whole food nutrition is,

4282
01:42:35,371 --> 01:42:36,580
has gone a long way for me,

4283
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:37,990
particularly when I need to recover.

4284
01:42:38,370 --> 01:42:38,680
Now.

4285
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:40,270
Do you mess with CBD at all?

4286
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:41,051
Um,

4287
01:42:41,051 --> 01:42:41,884
it's not something I've,

4288
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,970
I've done a lot of,

4289
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:43,261
uh,

4290
01:42:43,261 --> 01:42:44,470
I hear amazing things.

4291
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:46,570
I've definitely not opposed to it at all.

4292
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:47,200
Uh,

4293
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:47,831
but I,

4294
01:42:47,831 --> 01:42:48,101
uh,

4295
01:42:48,101 --> 01:42:48,491
I haven't,

4296
01:42:48,491 --> 01:42:49,060
I haven't tried.

4297
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:50,440
What's your experience been with that?

4298
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:53,220
I've been experimented with it
for the last couple of years.

4299
01:42:53,221 --> 01:42:57,120
It has a pretty profound
effect on alleviating soreness,

4300
01:42:57,121 --> 01:42:58,740
especially joint soreness.

4301
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,790
And it also makes you feel good though.

4302
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:04,680
The word is that it alleviates anxiety,

4303
01:43:04,681 --> 01:43:06,150
which I don't suffer a lot of,

4304
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:08,580
but it makes me feel relaxed.

4305
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:09,170
Did you,

4306
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:11,340
do you take it orally or
do you use it topically?

4307
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:12,540
I take a look.

4308
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:13,374
A dropper.

4309
01:43:13,530 --> 01:43:16,290
The dropper I'd take like
whatever they say to take.

4310
01:43:16,291 --> 01:43:17,670
I took like five times more than that.

4311
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:20,190
Did you take it at night?

4312
01:43:20,191 --> 01:43:23,010
Like they're gonna take it during the
morning and I take it at night as well.

4313
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:27,540
I just always feel like I'm
running my body at red line,

4314
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,670
running my brain at red line so much.

4315
01:43:29,671 --> 01:43:30,840
So whatever they say you need,

4316
01:43:30,841 --> 01:43:33,150
I just double it for almost everything.

4317
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:34,090
And do you feel like,

4318
01:43:34,091 --> 01:43:35,920
obviously it doesn't have
the THC effects of it,

4319
01:43:35,921 --> 01:43:37,230
but do you feel like in it,

4320
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:37,900
no,

4321
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:38,370
nothing.

4322
01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:39,790
You're not clear headed clear mind.

4323
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:40,101
Yeah,

4324
01:43:40,101 --> 01:43:43,430
and my THC tolerance is
so high it doesn't really,

4325
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,890
but some forms of it,

4326
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:46,310
uh,

4327
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:51,260
have a small amount of THC and I think
there may be some sort of synergistic

4328
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:54,260
that that happens with the THC combined.

4329
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:58,400
The CBD that helps people even
more because a lot of people,

4330
01:43:58,401 --> 01:43:58,670
uh,

4331
01:43:58,670 --> 01:43:59,840
that have pain,

4332
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:01,460
particularly chronic pain,

4333
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:06,490
they experience a lot of relief from THC
from just smoking or vaporizing it or

4334
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:08,000
using edibles.

4335
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:09,560
So I think that the,

4336
01:44:09,561 --> 01:44:09,711
uh,

4337
01:44:09,711 --> 01:44:13,460
the CBD with a little bit of
THC might have a better effect.

4338
01:44:13,461 --> 01:44:14,090
A lot of fighters say,

4339
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:14,360
yeah,

4340
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:14,850
sure.

4341
01:44:14,850 --> 01:44:15,100
No,

4342
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:15,231
I'm,

4343
01:44:15,231 --> 01:44:17,210
I'm interested in trying the CVD for sure.

4344
01:44:17,211 --> 01:44:18,430
Something I should definitely try it.

4345
01:44:18,431 --> 01:44:20,180
Do you find that it gives
you like a sustained,

4346
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,250
like as it relief when it's in your body,

4347
01:44:22,251 --> 01:44:25,700
like a masking relief or do you feel
like it actually is like curing the root

4348
01:44:25,701 --> 01:44:27,530
cause of that inflammation or anxiety?

4349
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:28,910
It's masking it all.

4350
01:44:28,911 --> 01:44:31,820
I think it's alleviating the inflammation.

4351
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:32,600
It's just,

4352
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,640
it's a very healthy thing
for your body to eat.

4353
01:44:34,641 --> 01:44:34,860
It's,

4354
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:35,271
well,

4355
01:44:35,271 --> 01:44:35,541
you know,

4356
01:44:35,541 --> 01:44:36,100
obviously,

4357
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:36,320
uh,

4358
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,840
there's a bunch of different oils
that will alleviate inflammation,

4359
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:43,040
different essential fatty acids and
fish oils are very good for him.

4360
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:43,940
Information,

4361
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:47,300
I think anything that you can take that
helps your body mitigate inflammation.

4362
01:44:47,301 --> 01:44:49,500
Inflammation seems to be a
gigantic problem without,

4363
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:52,040
with just not with pain just with paint.

4364
01:44:52,041 --> 01:44:53,420
But I think also with anxiety,

4365
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:54,254
I think it's,

4366
01:44:54,290 --> 01:44:57,410
it's entirely possible that
feelings of discomfort,

4367
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:57,930
you know,

4368
01:44:57,930 --> 01:44:58,580
like,

4369
01:44:58,580 --> 01:44:59,001
like when you,

4370
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:00,770
when you see people that are anxious,

4371
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:02,390
they're often look bloated.

4372
01:45:02,391 --> 01:45:02,750
To me,

4373
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:03,583
they often look like,

4374
01:45:04,050 --> 01:45:07,190
I think it's just an
overall sense of unwellness,

4375
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:07,851
you know?

4376
01:45:07,851 --> 01:45:12,851
And I think that poor diet exacerbates
that and a good diet can alleviate some

4377
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:15,380
of those symptoms.

4378
01:45:15,381 --> 01:45:17,660
And I think that CBD
is a big part of that.

4379
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:18,581
100%.

4380
01:45:18,581 --> 01:45:19,000
I mean,

4381
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:19,271
yeah,

4382
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:19,511
I'm,

4383
01:45:19,511 --> 01:45:19,740
I'm,

4384
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:21,160
I'm interested to try that for sure.

4385
01:45:21,161 --> 01:45:23,410
I've definitely that inflammation.

4386
01:45:23,411 --> 01:45:26,170
Even for me coming back from Antarctica
and this quarter of recovery phase.

4387
01:45:26,171 --> 01:45:28,720
What's weird is like you
saw how lean I got then,

4388
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:32,920
but my body I think cause it was so
depleted of food source is now actually

4389
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:36,520
almost trying to put fat back on my
body like of kind of storing that.

4390
01:45:36,521 --> 01:45:37,780
So actually my body comes to some,

4391
01:45:37,781 --> 01:45:40,450
feels weird to me right now because my
body is like just like trying to figure

4392
01:45:40,451 --> 01:45:43,540
out where the hell I'm at and I think
a lot of that comes from that chronic

4393
01:45:43,541 --> 01:45:47,140
inflammation and certainly just those
elevated cortisol levels of just being so

4394
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:48,820
jacked up and red line like you said,

4395
01:45:48,821 --> 01:45:52,780
just like so wired because of finding
ways to kind of mitigate that I think is

4396
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,550
crucial and I should try it.

4397
01:45:54,610 --> 01:45:56,930
What form would you
recommend trying that perform

4398
01:45:56,940 --> 01:45:57,181
like that?

4399
01:45:57,181 --> 01:45:57,751
I like to draw.

4400
01:45:57,751 --> 01:46:02,040
I like it because like
there's gel tabs are fine,

4401
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:05,150
but I think it's unnecessary
about is absorbing that the coal,

4402
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:06,570
the cover scope,

4403
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:08,760
the stuff just go right to the oil.

4404
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:10,320
I just think it's the best way to do it,

4405
01:46:10,321 --> 01:46:10,561
but I'm a,

4406
01:46:10,561 --> 01:46:13,530
I'm a big fan of curcumin
and Tumeric as well.

4407
01:46:13,531 --> 01:46:16,700
I think those are really good to try
and Ashwagandha or any of the like the

4408
01:46:16,710 --> 01:46:17,360
mushroom,

4409
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:19,170
the mushroom teas and stuff like that.

4410
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:21,060
This stuff actually
that I have right here,

4411
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:23,430
that just wasn't a
plant while lion's mane,

4412
01:46:23,431 --> 01:46:24,241
mushroom elixir.

4413
01:46:24,241 --> 01:46:25,080
I love this stuff.

4414
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:25,650
Yeah.

4415
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:25,760
Yeah.

4416
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:26,610
I take this,

4417
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:27,473
uh,

4418
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:28,321
all the time.

4419
01:46:28,321 --> 01:46:33,321
I make a tea out of this mess with like
the courthouse steps and the Ashwagandha

4420
01:46:33,811 --> 01:46:34,051
as well.

4421
01:46:34,051 --> 01:46:35,910
They kind of reduce some
of the good cortisol,

4422
01:46:35,911 --> 01:46:38,760
like emotional or hormonal
balances type of stuff.

4423
01:46:38,790 --> 01:46:39,540
Quarter sepsis.

4424
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:40,470
Fantastic too.

4425
01:46:40,471 --> 01:46:42,300
For endurance to 100%.

4426
01:46:42,301 --> 01:46:42,571
Yeah,

4427
01:46:42,571 --> 01:46:43,950
we have a PR on it.

4428
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:47,560
We have an audit product called shroom
tech sport that is core to subs,

4429
01:46:47,570 --> 01:46:49,860
a B vitamins and a bunch adaptogens.

4430
01:46:49,861 --> 01:46:50,280
It really

4431
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:50,610
cool.

4432
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:55,610
Really has a big impact on me in terms
of like how hard I can push in the gym.

4433
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:58,590
I take it about an hour
or so before it out.

4434
01:46:58,620 --> 01:46:59,400
Yeah.

4435
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,260
Let your body absorb it and it just,

4436
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:02,670
it just really has a real effect.

4437
01:47:02,690 --> 01:47:04,650
It doesn't give me a jittery thing either.

4438
01:47:04,670 --> 01:47:05,190
Yeah.

4439
01:47:05,190 --> 01:47:06,780
It just gives me more energy.

4440
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,770
Just kind of take it an hour before it
kind of primes your body for that more

4441
01:47:09,810 --> 01:47:10,591
oxygen uptake.

4442
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:12,450
Is that Kinda the idea behind Cortis apps?

4443
01:47:12,451 --> 01:47:13,470
That's what I've been told anyway.

4444
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:16,650
It came out of a high altitude herders.

4445
01:47:16,651 --> 01:47:17,484
They noticed that.

4446
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:18,300
Yeah.

4447
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:21,570
When there the cattle were
eating certain mushrooms,

4448
01:47:21,571 --> 01:47:23,760
they had more energy and so then they,

4449
01:47:23,761 --> 01:47:24,171
that's,

4450
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:25,860
that's how they started
experimenting with this stuff.

4451
01:47:25,861 --> 01:47:27,750
They actually grow it on caterpillars.

4452
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:28,350
What?

4453
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:28,980
Yeah,

4454
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:30,510
so strange man.

4455
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:31,590
See if he can find it.

4456
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:36,300
Cordyceps mushrooms grown on
caterpillar picturing like this room of

4457
01:47:36,301 --> 01:47:38,950
caterpillars with like carrying
around mushrooms on their back.

4458
01:47:39,890 --> 01:47:40,890
It's real freaky.

4459
01:47:41,190 --> 01:47:42,090
It's really freaky.

4460
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,980
But apparently the way they farm it,

4461
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:44,970
that's the way they farm it.

4462
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,680
They actually grow it on Caterpillar.

4463
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:47,971
That's fascinating.

4464
01:47:47,971 --> 01:47:48,804
Yeah.

4465
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:49,440
Weird.

4466
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,580
It's expensive shit,

4467
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:52,260
but like there it is.

4468
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:52,990
Oh Wow.

4469
01:47:52,990 --> 01:47:54,300
Look how fucking strange.

4470
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:55,134
So those,

4471
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:56,011
that the bottom there,

4472
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:58,620
that's the caterpillars and the mushroom
growing out of their heads or something

4473
01:47:58,621 --> 01:47:58,980
like,

4474
01:47:58,980 --> 01:47:59,611
thank you.

4475
01:47:59,611 --> 01:48:02,640
I'll take that snip that
shit off the caterpillars.

4476
01:48:04,170 --> 01:48:05,370
Fucking weird man.

4477
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:06,270
Yeah.

4478
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:08,490
Well apparently it works well.

4479
01:48:08,491 --> 01:48:09,001
It does.

4480
01:48:09,001 --> 01:48:09,271
Yeah.

4481
01:48:09,271 --> 01:48:09,600
It's,

4482
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,021
you know,

4483
01:48:10,021 --> 01:48:13,680
there's so many bad at mean Paul Stamets
who's been on the podcast before and I

4484
01:48:13,681 --> 01:48:14,910
can't wait to get them back on again,

4485
01:48:14,911 --> 01:48:18,930
but he's a mycologist and it was one of
the best podcasts that I've ever done in

4486
01:48:18,931 --> 01:48:23,931
terms of like really explaining the
benefits of different fungi and different

4487
01:48:24,271 --> 01:48:29,271
mushrooms and how many
different nutritional benefits
you can derive from them.

4488
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:30,010
I mean,

4489
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:30,210
I,

4490
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:31,940
I can't agree more just the,

4491
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:32,550
the,

4492
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:34,890
the whole food nutrition
from many different levels.

4493
01:48:35,170 --> 01:48:36,003
It's mushroom,

4494
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:36,710
Tumeric,

4495
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:38,160
this full plant derivatives.

4496
01:48:38,161 --> 01:48:38,401
I mean,

4497
01:48:38,401 --> 01:48:39,540
to me they go,

4498
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:41,100
they go a long way in their pure form.

4499
01:48:41,101 --> 01:48:41,700
For sure.

4500
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:42,151
Yeah.

4501
01:48:42,151 --> 01:48:42,821
What about what,

4502
01:48:42,821 --> 01:48:43,621
what do you drink?

4503
01:48:43,621 --> 01:48:44,940
Do you drink a lot of water?

4504
01:48:44,941 --> 01:48:46,170
Do you drink fruit juices,

4505
01:48:46,171 --> 01:48:47,160
vegetable juices?

4506
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:48,480
Mostly,

4507
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,141
mostly water.

4508
01:48:49,141 --> 01:48:50,190
To be perfectly honest,

4509
01:48:50,270 --> 01:48:50,800
um,

4510
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:50,920
I,

4511
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:55,020
I do usually start the day
with a smoothie of some kind.

4512
01:48:55,021 --> 01:48:55,980
So usually it's got,

4513
01:48:55,981 --> 01:48:56,850
it's got fruit in it.

4514
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:58,033
Um,

4515
01:48:58,350 --> 01:48:59,131
obviously fruit.

4516
01:48:59,131 --> 01:49:00,150
And the other thing I put in there,

4517
01:49:00,151 --> 01:49:00,271
it's,

4518
01:49:00,271 --> 01:49:04,890
I've been using this stuff that it's
actually the company standard process is

4519
01:49:04,891 --> 01:49:05,820
just coming out with it,

4520
01:49:05,821 --> 01:49:06,211
but they,

4521
01:49:06,211 --> 01:49:07,140
let me try it ahead of time.

4522
01:49:07,141 --> 01:49:11,130
At Starbucks is slow release glucose
so it's a protein powder but instead of

4523
01:49:11,131 --> 01:49:14,220
giving to that glucose spike like you
would from a refined sugar or something

4524
01:49:14,221 --> 01:49:14,581
like that,

4525
01:49:14,581 --> 01:49:16,920
it's kind of a long
burn long-chain glucose.

4526
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:17,371
Um,

4527
01:49:17,371 --> 01:49:19,530
I don't know the full chemistry of that,

4528
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:22,590
but I find it makes a big
difference rather than kind
of just getting that sugar

4529
01:49:22,591 --> 01:49:23,640
spike early in the day.

4530
01:49:23,641 --> 01:49:25,590
It actually kind of gives
this slow release of energy.

4531
01:49:25,591 --> 01:49:28,170
And I was using that was actually
in the column bars as well.

4532
01:49:28,171 --> 01:49:30,900
And I really liked that particularly
for endurance because you know,

4533
01:49:30,901 --> 01:49:33,750
if you start like taking the goop
packets or something like that,

4534
01:49:33,751 --> 01:49:35,340
you get that spike of a hundred calories.

4535
01:49:35,341 --> 01:49:36,780
You get that like quick like boom,

4536
01:49:36,781 --> 01:49:39,330
burst of energy replies
replenished at your glucose stores.

4537
01:49:39,630 --> 01:49:41,520
But this I feel like
just as a much slower,

4538
01:49:41,521 --> 01:49:42,360
cleaner burn.

4539
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:44,370
And it lasts a longer for technically,

4540
01:49:44,371 --> 01:49:44,581
you know,

4541
01:49:44,581 --> 01:49:44,930
for,

4542
01:49:44,930 --> 01:49:45,990
for anaerobic stuff.

4543
01:49:45,991 --> 01:49:48,320
I mean maybe you need kind
of that explosive power

4544
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:48,671
or whatever,

4545
01:49:48,671 --> 01:49:48,851
you know,

4546
01:49:48,851 --> 01:49:49,810
different things for that.

4547
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:52,030
But for some of the like
low heart rate zone one,

4548
01:49:52,031 --> 01:49:55,360
zone two like long grinding type of stuff
that I do in the mountains or pulling

4549
01:49:55,361 --> 01:49:56,021
the sled or whatever,

4550
01:49:56,021 --> 01:49:57,760
I find it's really good
for stuff like that.

4551
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:02,590
Now what scares me about people
like you is how old are you now?

4552
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:03,453
33.

4553
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,450
You're very young.

4554
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,250
I'll take that.

4555
01:50:06,250 --> 01:50:06,870
This is,

4556
01:50:06,870 --> 01:50:08,050
this is what I'm worried.

4557
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:13,140
I'm worried that you've already done so
much crazy shit that you have to push

4558
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:20,340
past the craziest shit you've already
done and you've already been on Everest.

4559
01:50:20,771 --> 01:50:23,950
It sounds like you were kind of
like you weren't on death's door,

4560
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:25,270
but you open the front gate,

4561
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:26,651
the front gate.

4562
01:50:26,651 --> 01:50:27,480
You were on the lawn.

4563
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:27,920
Yeah.

4564
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:28,110
Yeah.

4565
01:50:28,110 --> 01:50:29,080
You're on death's lawn.

4566
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:29,740
Sure.

4567
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:30,573
You know.

4568
01:50:30,650 --> 01:50:30,890
No,

4569
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:31,461
absolutely.

4570
01:50:31,461 --> 01:50:33,800
I mean you never said that people
were literally died that day.

4571
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:34,693
Um,

4572
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:35,600
you know,

4573
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,010
did he do to try to do next?

4574
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:37,401
This is,

4575
01:50:37,401 --> 01:50:38,450
this is the question like,

4576
01:50:38,451 --> 01:50:38,690
yeah,

4577
01:50:38,690 --> 01:50:40,440
do you have some crazy shit
in your head right now?

4578
01:50:40,441 --> 01:50:40,731
And you're like,

4579
01:50:40,731 --> 01:50:40,971
okay,

4580
01:50:40,971 --> 01:50:42,190
now I'm going to the moon with a fucking,

4581
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:44,031
you know,

4582
01:50:44,031 --> 01:50:44,631
it's bloody,

4583
01:50:44,631 --> 01:50:45,411
it's two fold.

4584
01:50:45,411 --> 01:50:46,730
It's an interesting intersection.

4585
01:50:46,731 --> 01:50:47,740
I appreciate that.

4586
01:50:47,741 --> 01:50:48,530
That you call me,

4587
01:50:48,530 --> 01:50:49,131
call me young.

4588
01:50:49,131 --> 01:50:50,420
I'll take that all day long,

4589
01:50:50,421 --> 01:50:52,730
but 51 so you are younger to me,

4590
01:50:52,970 --> 01:50:55,190
but I guess in terms of an athlete terms,

4591
01:50:55,191 --> 01:50:55,580
right?

4592
01:50:55,580 --> 01:50:56,120
You know,

4593
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:56,953
you're in the,

4594
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:58,310
you're in the Pete.

4595
01:50:58,311 --> 01:50:58,470
Yeah,

4596
01:50:58,470 --> 01:51:00,890
the peak for endurance athletes
and it's fun to be here.

4597
01:51:00,891 --> 01:51:04,340
But I also think it's a moment
in time where a little bit of,

4598
01:51:04,430 --> 01:51:04,971
a little bit,

4599
01:51:04,971 --> 01:51:06,740
I'll say I won't give
myself too much credit,

4600
01:51:06,741 --> 01:51:09,320
but a little bit of wisdom
meets also athletic performance.

4601
01:51:09,321 --> 01:51:11,330
A moment in time where
I've had enough experience,

4602
01:51:11,331 --> 01:51:12,141
enough setbacks,

4603
01:51:12,141 --> 01:51:15,770
ups and downs and success of course with
the world records and things I have,

4604
01:51:15,771 --> 01:51:19,220
but to really take stock
of what's important to me
and what I've realized more

4605
01:51:19,221 --> 01:51:23,150
and more is I'm super curious about
pushing the limits of my own potential

4606
01:51:23,151 --> 01:51:24,680
hundred percent we've talked about that.

4607
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:25,513
I love that.

4608
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:28,820
But I actually don't think of myself so
much as a risk taker or an adrenaline

4609
01:51:28,821 --> 01:51:30,760
junkie when say serious.

4610
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:32,720
I'm not just bullshitting.

4611
01:51:32,721 --> 01:51:32,930
You're like,

4612
01:51:32,930 --> 01:51:33,231
I really,

4613
01:51:33,231 --> 01:51:34,011
when I think about it,

4614
01:51:34,011 --> 01:51:35,240
like these things are,

4615
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:36,860
are really methodical.

4616
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:37,723
There's sign out,

4617
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:38,170
know their,

4618
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:39,003
their practice,

4619
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:39,611
they're there.

4620
01:51:39,611 --> 01:51:40,760
And it's not to say there's not risk.

4621
01:51:40,761 --> 01:51:42,650
You saw me trying to set up
my tent that tent flies away.

4622
01:51:42,651 --> 01:51:43,490
Like I'm screwed.

4623
01:51:43,491 --> 01:51:44,420
Like I'm in a bad way.

4624
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:44,810
Um,

4625
01:51:44,810 --> 01:51:45,261
what would you do?

4626
01:51:45,261 --> 01:51:46,160
Would you run after it?

4627
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:46,641
I mean,

4628
01:51:46,641 --> 01:51:49,880
you'd sell no chance of catching
up for that thing thing is gone.

4629
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:50,390
Um,

4630
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:50,721
yeah.

4631
01:51:50,721 --> 01:51:50,921
You,

4632
01:51:50,921 --> 01:51:51,081
you know,

4633
01:51:51,081 --> 01:51:51,561
you hit the,

4634
01:51:51,561 --> 01:51:53,240
you hit the ejector button on the call,

4635
01:51:53,241 --> 01:51:53,871
the plane of hope,

4636
01:51:53,871 --> 01:51:55,040
they can find your type of thing.

4637
01:51:55,041 --> 01:51:56,680
And even that's like in our storm,

4638
01:51:56,690 --> 01:51:58,370
like that unlikely they're
going to get there.

4639
01:51:58,670 --> 01:51:59,271
But for me,

4640
01:51:59,271 --> 01:52:01,670
what I'm honestly most excited about next,

4641
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:02,330
um,

4642
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:02,631
yes,

4643
01:52:02,631 --> 01:52:04,640
I have some other projects
that I'm marinating in my mind.

4644
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:05,630
Do I have other expeditions?

4645
01:52:05,631 --> 01:52:05,871
Sure.

4646
01:52:05,871 --> 01:52:06,260
I haven't,

4647
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:06,701
I haven't,

4648
01:52:06,701 --> 01:52:07,190
uh,

4649
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:09,380
they're not fully crystallized
enough to announce right here,

4650
01:52:09,381 --> 01:52:10,071
unfortunately.

4651
01:52:10,071 --> 01:52:10,491
But,

4652
01:52:10,491 --> 01:52:11,120
um,

4653
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:11,301
you know,

4654
01:52:11,301 --> 01:52:13,940
I've got some ideas but more
so like I'm excited about,

4655
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:14,510
you know,

4656
01:52:14,510 --> 01:52:15,470
sharing what I've learned.

4657
01:52:15,471 --> 01:52:15,861
Like I said,

4658
01:52:15,861 --> 01:52:18,560
that wisdom meets high performance
of actually having an ability.

4659
01:52:18,561 --> 01:52:18,741
Now,

4660
01:52:18,741 --> 01:52:19,280
like I said,

4661
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:20,031
when I started this,

4662
01:52:20,031 --> 01:52:20,550
I had,

4663
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:20,750
you know,

4664
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:23,780
my friends following me on Instagram and
I'm starting to have ability to share

4665
01:52:23,781 --> 01:52:24,231
this story.

4666
01:52:24,231 --> 01:52:25,340
People are asking for me to,

4667
01:52:25,470 --> 01:52:25,770
you know,

4668
01:52:25,770 --> 01:52:26,391
take interviews.

4669
01:52:26,391 --> 01:52:26,491
I'm,

4670
01:52:26,491 --> 01:52:27,740
I'm writing a book right now.

4671
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:30,140
Lots of my learnings going into
that kind of stuff of really,

4672
01:52:30,141 --> 01:52:32,270
really having an ability to pass this on.

4673
01:52:32,271 --> 01:52:33,104
Because for me,

4674
01:52:33,140 --> 01:52:35,270
as fun as it is for me
to push my own limits,

4675
01:52:35,271 --> 01:52:35,721
like I,

4676
01:52:35,721 --> 01:52:36,680
what really inspires me.

4677
01:52:36,681 --> 01:52:38,520
What really fires me up is when,

4678
01:52:38,521 --> 01:52:40,430
when I get emails or
notes from people like,

4679
01:52:40,431 --> 01:52:41,090
hey man,

4680
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:42,410
I watched across Antarctica.

4681
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,120
I haven't been to the gym in five years.

4682
01:52:44,121 --> 01:52:46,970
And like I've gone every day since
then or I'm trail running now.

4683
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:48,650
Or like I started that business,

4684
01:52:48,651 --> 01:52:50,390
I never said I was going
to star or whatever.

4685
01:52:50,391 --> 01:52:54,080
And so having an ability to have a moment
in time when I can share some of my

4686
01:52:54,081 --> 01:52:54,561
learnings.

4687
01:52:54,561 --> 01:52:54,771
You know,

4688
01:52:54,771 --> 01:52:56,810
with the world in meaningful
different contents.

4689
01:52:56,811 --> 01:52:57,080
That's,

4690
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:58,310
that really excites me.

4691
01:52:58,311 --> 01:52:58,550
You know,

4692
01:52:58,550 --> 01:52:59,870
I love the opportunity to do that,

4693
01:52:59,871 --> 01:53:00,470
but man,

4694
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:02,060
like for sure there's some other,

4695
01:53:02,061 --> 01:53:04,070
there's some other events
on the horizon as well,

4696
01:53:04,071 --> 01:53:04,910
but uh,

4697
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:05,361
but yeah,

4698
01:53:05,361 --> 01:53:07,670
it's not just about one
upping the next thing.

4699
01:53:07,671 --> 01:53:08,870
I think that that's a,

4700
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:12,590
a losing proposition in the long run
of always trying to do the bigger,

4701
01:53:12,591 --> 01:53:12,891
badder,

4702
01:53:12,891 --> 01:53:13,521
craziest thing.

4703
01:53:13,521 --> 01:53:14,930
Because when the stakes are,

4704
01:53:14,931 --> 01:53:15,471
like you said,

4705
01:53:15,471 --> 01:53:17,090
the razors line between life and death,

4706
01:53:17,091 --> 01:53:18,380
you keep one upping yourself enough.

4707
01:53:18,381 --> 01:53:18,591
You know,

4708
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:19,040
you don't,

4709
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:20,780
you don't make it to
the end of a long life,

4710
01:53:20,781 --> 01:53:21,381
unfortunately.

4711
01:53:21,381 --> 01:53:22,640
And I'm not trying to
have that be the end.

4712
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:22,951
Well,

4713
01:53:22,951 --> 01:53:23,611
it sounds like,

4714
01:53:23,611 --> 01:53:25,380
I know you've already
broken world records.

4715
01:53:25,381 --> 01:53:25,710
You've,

4716
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:26,450
you,

4717
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:27,090
you,

4718
01:53:27,090 --> 01:53:31,290
you're in this weird place where you've
accomplished so much that in order to

4719
01:53:31,291 --> 01:53:32,460
accomplish other things,

4720
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,830
if you're going to take
it to the next level,

4721
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:38,010
it really has to be
truly life threatening.

4722
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:39,890
Do you have any recommendations?

4723
01:53:39,891 --> 01:53:44,891
Do you want to come on the next one will
say move into the next stage of life

4724
01:53:45,651 --> 01:53:46,650
that doesn't involve risky.

4725
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:47,751
I don't know.

4726
01:53:47,751 --> 01:53:48,650
You seem like a nice guy.

4727
01:53:48,651 --> 01:53:49,580
I don't want anything to happen to you.

4728
01:53:49,610 --> 01:53:49,940
Okay.

4729
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:50,330
Give me,

4730
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:51,141
give me some wisdom.

4731
01:53:51,141 --> 01:53:51,741
You've got a couple of,

4732
01:53:51,741 --> 01:53:53,270
almost a couple of decades on me.

4733
01:53:53,271 --> 01:53:53,521
If you,

4734
01:53:53,521 --> 01:53:56,150
if you were whispering in the
ear of your 33 year old self,

4735
01:53:56,151 --> 01:53:56,691
how about this?

4736
01:53:56,691 --> 01:53:57,050
You know,

4737
01:53:57,050 --> 01:53:57,481
you've,

4738
01:53:57,481 --> 01:53:58,700
you've had an interesting path.

4739
01:53:58,701 --> 01:54:00,560
If you're whispering in
the ear of your 33 self,

4740
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:03,530
what would be some advice that you would
give yourself that you'd be happy that

4741
01:54:03,531 --> 01:54:05,360
you lived out over the next 20 years?

4742
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:06,390
Well,

4743
01:54:06,390 --> 01:54:08,380
I mean obviously life experience.

4744
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:10,270
When you have life experience,

4745
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:11,530
learn those lessons.

4746
01:54:11,531 --> 01:54:12,760
Become a better person,

4747
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:14,200
be better at communicating,

4748
01:54:14,201 --> 01:54:15,520
be better at everything you do.

4749
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:20,050
But the problem with what you're
doing and it's not a problem,

4750
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:20,780
but in,

4751
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:22,120
in this context,

4752
01:54:22,210 --> 01:54:27,070
is that you're pushing these incredible
endurance records in nature and

4753
01:54:27,071 --> 01:54:28,810
particularly in cold weather.

4754
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:34,300
And this is what's stunning about these
things is that you're risking your life.

4755
01:54:34,630 --> 01:54:35,441
It's not that,

4756
01:54:35,441 --> 01:54:36,910
it's just difficult.

4757
01:54:37,150 --> 01:54:40,720
Like running in ultra marathon
is incredibly difficult,

4758
01:54:40,721 --> 01:54:40,901
right?

4759
01:54:40,901 --> 01:54:41,620
Sure.

4760
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:43,930
But what you're doing is not
just incredibly difficult.

4761
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:46,870
You're doing it in these incredibly
harsh environments and particularly in

4762
01:54:46,871 --> 01:54:47,590
Antarctica,

4763
01:54:47,590 --> 01:54:49,930
you don't have any relief.

4764
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:51,070
There's nothing.

4765
01:54:51,070 --> 01:54:52,000
No one's going to help you.

4766
01:54:52,001 --> 01:54:52,481
Like you said,

4767
01:54:52,481 --> 01:54:53,370
your tent blows away.

4768
01:54:53,371 --> 01:54:54,040
You're like,

4769
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:55,990
you might very well be fucked,

4770
01:54:56,380 --> 01:54:57,213
right.

4771
01:54:57,780 --> 01:54:59,320
You are right.

4772
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:04,800
I don't know what you could do that
would one up that this is the problem is

4773
01:55:06,041 --> 01:55:06,874
like you're,

4774
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:12,000
you're one up margin of error is
you're in this very strange sort of

4775
01:55:13,001 --> 01:55:14,020
stratosphere

4776
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:14,460
yeah.

4777
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:15,630
Of one attitude.

4778
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,530
Maybe.

4779
01:55:16,530 --> 01:55:17,670
Maybe it's um,

4780
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:18,211
you know,

4781
01:55:18,211 --> 01:55:21,000
we take a page out of the Bruce
Springsteen glory days song and just,

4782
01:55:21,001 --> 01:55:21,211
you know,

4783
01:55:21,211 --> 01:55:24,000
kick might kick my feet up and talk
about the glory days for the rest of the

4784
01:55:24,001 --> 01:55:24,600
time.

4785
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:25,920
You don't have to do that.

4786
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:26,940
But the thing is,

4787
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:28,111
I mean,

4788
01:55:28,111 --> 01:55:28,891
don't listen to me,

4789
01:55:28,891 --> 01:55:29,130
man.

4790
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:30,210
Do whatever you want to do.

4791
01:55:30,211 --> 01:55:31,200
Obviously you're going to,

4792
01:55:31,201 --> 01:55:32,100
you're not going to listen to me,

4793
01:55:32,101 --> 01:55:33,900
but you could do,

4794
01:55:33,901 --> 01:55:38,310
you hit apply this sort of mental
fortitude that you've demonstrated in this

4795
01:55:38,311 --> 01:55:41,550
ability to push the things you
could apply it to anything.

4796
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:42,960
It doesn't have to.

4797
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:47,370
This physical feats of risking death
and in frigid cold temperatures in the

4798
01:55:47,371 --> 01:55:51,540
middle of the fucking
nowhere are literally at the
bottom of the planet earth

4799
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:52,491
that I know and,

4800
01:55:52,491 --> 01:55:53,201
and that's to me,

4801
01:55:53,201 --> 01:55:54,034
that's actually,

4802
01:55:54,190 --> 01:55:55,840
that's why it's exciting because for me,

4803
01:55:56,290 --> 01:55:56,711
yes.

4804
01:55:56,711 --> 01:56:00,010
Are there some other physical expression
that I want to have in the world?

4805
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:00,731
For sure.

4806
01:56:00,731 --> 01:56:02,320
I know I have some ideas like I said,

4807
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:02,801
but,

4808
01:56:02,801 --> 01:56:04,900
and it's not necessarily trying
to one up the next thing,

4809
01:56:04,901 --> 01:56:07,150
but it's also why it's exciting to me.

4810
01:56:07,330 --> 01:56:09,940
The lessons that I try to learn that
I try to share with other people,

4811
01:56:09,941 --> 01:56:10,391
like you said,

4812
01:56:10,391 --> 01:56:11,530
our universal lessons,

4813
01:56:11,531 --> 01:56:12,101
but they also,

4814
01:56:12,101 --> 01:56:15,970
if I referred them back to my own self
are also universal lessons in my own

4815
01:56:15,971 --> 01:56:16,271
life.

4816
01:56:16,271 --> 01:56:16,781
So like you said,

4817
01:56:16,781 --> 01:56:17,021
it's like,

4818
01:56:17,021 --> 01:56:17,231
hey,

4819
01:56:17,231 --> 01:56:19,390
like what's the next thing
I'm super passionate about?

4820
01:56:19,391 --> 01:56:19,571
If you,

4821
01:56:19,571 --> 01:56:23,110
I have the confidence to sit
with a white board with no money,

4822
01:56:23,111 --> 01:56:23,861
no resources,

4823
01:56:23,861 --> 01:56:24,521
no background,

4824
01:56:24,521 --> 01:56:28,480
and incredibly supportive fiance at the
time now wife who's like down to like

4825
01:56:28,481 --> 01:56:31,090
ride or die with me and
go into this with me like,

4826
01:56:31,330 --> 01:56:32,410
and we created what we did.

4827
01:56:32,410 --> 01:56:34,660
We did something that people
literally wrote about and said,

4828
01:56:34,661 --> 01:56:35,500
this is impossible.

4829
01:56:35,501 --> 01:56:36,540
People have died trying this.

4830
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:37,930
You can't do this and we've achieved it.

4831
01:56:38,110 --> 01:56:39,010
It gives me confidence,

4832
01:56:39,011 --> 01:56:41,050
not that I can do some
other crazy physical thing,

4833
01:56:41,051 --> 01:56:42,070
but it gives me confidence like cool.

4834
01:56:42,071 --> 01:56:43,150
Like I want to start off,

4835
01:56:43,180 --> 01:56:45,160
I want to start a business
that makes millions of dollars,

4836
01:56:45,161 --> 01:56:45,581
like cool.

4837
01:56:45,581 --> 01:56:46,900
Like let's figure out how to do that.

4838
01:56:46,901 --> 01:56:47,110
Let's,

4839
01:56:47,110 --> 01:56:48,820
let's do the equivalent
of writing into Google.

4840
01:56:48,821 --> 01:56:50,560
What's the difference
between PR and marketing?

4841
01:56:50,561 --> 01:56:50,801
You know,

4842
01:56:50,801 --> 01:56:51,820
like let's do that.

4843
01:56:51,821 --> 01:56:52,330
So,

4844
01:56:52,330 --> 01:56:52,900
you know,

4845
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:53,650
as I,

4846
01:56:53,650 --> 01:56:54,041
as I,

4847
01:56:54,041 --> 01:56:54,311
you know,

4848
01:56:54,311 --> 01:56:56,140
do a ton of public speaking
now write this book,

4849
01:56:56,141 --> 01:56:59,170
the things are things that I'm doing
that's super fun to share those with the

4850
01:56:59,171 --> 01:56:59,501
world.

4851
01:56:59,501 --> 01:57:02,830
So I'm having a lot of fun doing that
and actually sharing the universal truths

4852
01:57:02,831 --> 01:57:05,800
and the wisdom that I've learned that I
think can it be applied different ways.

4853
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:09,700
But it also goes to now I get to have
the fun of applying those in all of those

4854
01:57:09,701 --> 01:57:11,680
other different ways of my life.

4855
01:57:11,681 --> 01:57:12,340
And so,

4856
01:57:12,340 --> 01:57:12,581
you know,

4857
01:57:12,581 --> 01:57:12,971
for me,

4858
01:57:12,971 --> 01:57:13,820
I think that the,

4859
01:57:13,850 --> 01:57:14,211
the,

4860
01:57:14,211 --> 01:57:15,400
the future is bright,

4861
01:57:15,401 --> 01:57:16,390
particularly if I don't,

4862
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:20,350
I don't really think of myself as
this endemic core outdoor athlete.

4863
01:57:20,351 --> 01:57:22,060
It's very easy to put me in that box.

4864
01:57:22,061 --> 01:57:23,200
It's very easy to say like,

4865
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:23,771
cool,

4866
01:57:23,771 --> 01:57:24,640
so you climb mountains,

4867
01:57:24,641 --> 01:57:26,440
you're a mountain climber
was like before years ago,

4868
01:57:26,441 --> 01:57:27,550
I had never really climbed mountains,

4869
01:57:27,551 --> 01:57:28,870
but I happen to do something about it.

4870
01:57:28,871 --> 01:57:30,100
So I've never been in the polar region.

4871
01:57:30,101 --> 01:57:32,260
That's why this British
guy was looking at me like,

4872
01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:32,550
oh,

4873
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:33,130
Hahaha,

4874
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:33,791
young boy,

4875
01:57:33,791 --> 01:57:35,200
I've spent all this time in an article.

4876
01:57:35,201 --> 01:57:36,160
You'll never survive this.

4877
01:57:36,161 --> 01:57:36,670
And like,

4878
01:57:36,670 --> 01:57:37,570
not only just survive it,

4879
01:57:37,571 --> 01:57:38,620
but like I finished first,

4880
01:57:38,621 --> 01:57:39,454
like I beat him,

4881
01:57:39,610 --> 01:57:41,680
but I'm not beat them
by two and a half days.

4882
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:43,973
Um,

4883
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:44,740
but like,

4884
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:45,880
I'm not sitting here going like,

4885
01:57:45,910 --> 01:57:46,091
you know,

4886
01:57:46,091 --> 01:57:47,170
I'm fascinated by Antarctica.

4887
01:57:47,171 --> 01:57:48,230
What I like to go back someday.

4888
01:57:48,280 --> 01:57:48,761
Absolutely.

4889
01:57:48,761 --> 01:57:52,060
But I'm not like calling a
Brady the polar explorer only,

4890
01:57:52,061 --> 01:57:52,231
you know,

4891
01:57:52,231 --> 01:57:52,810
it's like,

4892
01:57:52,810 --> 01:57:55,390
what else can I explore
that actually presses me?

4893
01:57:55,391 --> 01:57:55,660
I mean,

4894
01:57:55,660 --> 01:57:56,680
I love to learn.

4895
01:57:56,681 --> 01:57:58,000
I love to learn about the mind,

4896
01:57:58,001 --> 01:57:58,900
explore that.

4897
01:57:58,930 --> 01:57:59,230
Um,

4898
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:01,120
there's so many different
ways to express that,

4899
01:58:01,121 --> 01:58:04,180
that I'm just excited for what the future
holds in lots of different verticals.

4900
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:04,901
Well,

4901
01:58:04,901 --> 01:58:05,201
listen,

4902
01:58:05,201 --> 01:58:07,030
I think you could fucking do anything.

4903
01:58:07,090 --> 01:58:10,450
I think it's very clear what
you've already accomplished.

4904
01:58:10,451 --> 01:58:12,550
You could literally do anything you want,

4905
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:14,110
but I want to,

4906
01:58:14,110 --> 01:58:15,340
I want to see you live.

4907
01:58:15,370 --> 01:58:15,560
Yeah,

4908
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:16,393
me too.

4909
01:58:16,810 --> 01:58:17,643
How about this?

4910
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:22,800
How about you break some crazy endurance
running feats about that ultra marathon

4911
01:58:23,470 --> 01:58:24,670
because it feels a little bit safer.

4912
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:28,510
The worst thing's going to happen
to you to get really fucking tired.

4913
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:29,543
But

4914
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:30,910
maybe,

4915
01:58:30,910 --> 01:58:31,990
maybe the next thing is,

4916
01:58:31,991 --> 01:58:33,520
I mean maybe I'm not the
funniest guy in the world.

4917
01:58:33,521 --> 01:58:34,390
What do you think about comedy?

4918
01:58:34,391 --> 01:58:34,571
I mean,

4919
01:58:34,571 --> 01:58:35,351
I know that's a big piece,

4920
01:58:35,351 --> 01:58:35,621
you know,

4921
01:58:35,621 --> 01:58:37,150
should I get back out there on the stage?

4922
01:58:37,190 --> 01:58:37,670
Listen,

4923
01:58:37,670 --> 01:58:39,680
if you can communicate and
you can make people laugh,

4924
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:41,050
you can make a group of people laugh.

4925
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:42,190
Could do stand up comedy.

4926
01:58:42,191 --> 01:58:46,000
It's just a matter of taking steps and
figuring it out and writing stuff out.

4927
01:58:46,001 --> 01:58:46,811
And I mean,

4928
01:58:46,811 --> 01:58:50,110
you've got all a lot of
fucking stories for sure.

4929
01:58:50,111 --> 01:58:50,351
No,

4930
01:58:50,351 --> 01:58:52,990
I mean just how about getting on stage
in front of people and telling people

4931
01:58:52,991 --> 01:58:57,130
that you're the first person that
cross and article on foot 52 days?

4932
01:58:57,131 --> 01:58:58,210
Like what in the fuck.

4933
01:58:58,320 --> 01:58:59,400
I do a lot of that.

4934
01:58:59,401 --> 01:59:00,091
I did enjoy that.

4935
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:01,230
I love public speaking.

4936
01:59:01,231 --> 01:59:02,041
I do a lot of that.

4937
01:59:02,041 --> 01:59:02,821
Corporations,

4938
01:59:02,821 --> 01:59:03,130
kids,

4939
01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:03,740
everything.

4940
01:59:03,740 --> 01:59:04,530
That's too easy.

4941
01:59:04,530 --> 01:59:04,651
Well,

4942
01:59:04,651 --> 01:59:05,071
trust me,

4943
01:59:05,071 --> 01:59:05,904
I do it.

4944
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:06,571
You could do that.

4945
01:59:06,571 --> 01:59:06,720
Yeah.

4946
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:07,260
It's fun.

4947
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:07,560
No,

4948
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:09,030
I have to say I gotta give a shout out.

4949
01:59:09,210 --> 01:59:10,350
You definitely don't remember this,

4950
01:59:10,351 --> 01:59:14,280
but I actually have met you once before
about seven years ago in a tiny little

4951
01:59:14,281 --> 01:59:15,120
comedy club.

4952
01:59:15,330 --> 01:59:18,000
You did a bit out in Portland
of small little venue.

4953
01:59:18,001 --> 01:59:20,910
I'm sure you do way bigger
venues now called the helium.

4954
01:59:20,911 --> 01:59:21,121
Yeah,

4955
01:59:21,121 --> 01:59:21,651
exactly.

4956
01:59:21,651 --> 01:59:22,200
It's great.

4957
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:22,891
And a,

4958
01:59:22,891 --> 01:59:23,940
at the time it was funny,

4959
01:59:23,941 --> 01:59:25,140
I was thinking about
when I was driving over,

4960
01:59:25,141 --> 01:59:25,441
I was like,

4961
01:59:25,441 --> 01:59:25,621
wow,

4962
01:59:25,621 --> 01:59:26,101
what's this bit?

4963
01:59:26,101 --> 01:59:27,870
And you were doing this bit about,

4964
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,550
hey there Delilah.

4965
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:31,200
Was that like a damn,

4966
01:59:31,201 --> 01:59:32,450
that's a long time ago.

4967
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:34,110
Wow.

4968
01:59:34,111 --> 01:59:34,980
That's what I most remember it.

4969
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:36,900
But the reason I was there actually was,

4970
01:59:36,901 --> 01:59:37,530
um,

4971
01:59:37,530 --> 01:59:39,510
when I first started
training for triathlon,

4972
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:39,780
uh,

4973
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:40,351
professionally,

4974
01:59:40,351 --> 01:59:42,960
I started training with
this guy named Phil Claude,

4975
01:59:42,961 --> 01:59:44,940
who was training a couple
of UFC fighters that time.

4976
01:59:44,941 --> 01:59:48,690
You remember Mike Pierce who
fought in this local guy,

4977
01:59:48,990 --> 01:59:50,190
poor guy as well.

4978
01:59:50,191 --> 01:59:52,090
And so I didn't know a lot about MMA.

4979
01:59:52,091 --> 01:59:52,801
I still certainly,

4980
01:59:52,801 --> 01:59:54,180
I'm not as well versed as you are,

4981
01:59:54,181 --> 01:59:54,991
but I got in this gym,

4982
01:59:54,991 --> 01:59:55,591
my coach was like,

4983
01:59:55,591 --> 01:59:55,741
Hey,

4984
01:59:55,741 --> 01:59:57,390
you're going to start
training with these MMA guys.

4985
01:59:57,391 --> 01:59:57,930
And I was like,

4986
01:59:57,930 --> 01:59:58,681
you know what,

4987
01:59:58,681 --> 01:59:58,801
like,

4988
01:59:58,801 --> 02:00:00,120
I'm a skinny little triathlete.

4989
02:00:00,121 --> 02:00:01,020
These guys are like,

4990
02:00:01,021 --> 02:00:01,560
you know,

4991
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:02,820
brawlers but I was,

4992
02:00:02,850 --> 02:00:03,100
man,

4993
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:03,921
what does I impressed?

4994
02:00:03,921 --> 02:00:06,150
Like talk about a
multisport true multisport,

4995
02:00:06,151 --> 02:00:06,380
right?

4996
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:07,470
And all the different disciplines.

4997
02:00:07,471 --> 02:00:08,670
I don't have to tell you this obviously,

4998
02:00:08,671 --> 02:00:10,800
but I was blown away by
how strong the word became.

4999
02:00:10,801 --> 02:00:11,281
Good buddies.

5000
02:00:11,281 --> 02:00:12,031
And Mike said to me,

5001
02:00:12,031 --> 02:00:12,540
he was like,

5002
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:12,931
hey man,

5003
02:00:12,931 --> 02:00:14,160
I'm going to this comedy show.

5004
02:00:14,161 --> 02:00:16,920
This guy named Joe Rogan is going
to be doing his comedy calm,

5005
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:18,031
listen to him.

5006
02:00:18,031 --> 02:00:18,361
So,

5007
02:00:18,361 --> 02:00:19,020
uh,

5008
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:19,351
you know,

5009
02:00:19,351 --> 02:00:20,520
you made me laugh back then.

5010
02:00:20,521 --> 02:00:20,881
So,

5011
02:00:20,881 --> 02:00:21,120
uh,

5012
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:22,390
mad respect and uh,

5013
02:00:22,391 --> 02:00:22,510
yeah,

5014
02:00:22,510 --> 02:00:22,761
it was like,

5015
02:00:22,761 --> 02:00:23,281
it was a fun,

5016
02:00:23,281 --> 02:00:24,570
fun to see into that world a little bit.

5017
02:00:24,710 --> 02:00:25,131
Thanks man.

5018
02:00:25,131 --> 02:00:26,480
I guarantee you could do that,

5019
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:30,830
but if you still want to do endurance
things like please do something where

5020
02:00:30,831 --> 02:00:31,640
you're not going to die.

5021
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:32,473
That's all right.

5022
02:00:33,390 --> 02:00:33,810
You know,

5023
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:34,601
I made it back.

5024
02:00:34,601 --> 02:00:35,440
You're safe at salad.

5025
02:00:35,441 --> 02:00:35,651
So yeah,

5026
02:00:35,651 --> 02:00:36,041
the goal,

5027
02:00:36,041 --> 02:00:36,311
I mean,

5028
02:00:36,311 --> 02:00:36,761
like I said,

5029
02:00:36,761 --> 02:00:38,410
the goal was not to
keep one upping myself.

5030
02:00:38,650 --> 02:00:40,720
I mean I think that's a

5031
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:43,230
part of the danger of
this kind of endeavor.

5032
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:44,160
You means you,

5033
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:46,320
you really have one upped me.

5034
02:00:46,321 --> 02:00:48,150
You've done some crazy one up in man.

5035
02:00:48,630 --> 02:00:49,050
Sure.

5036
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:49,591
Like I said,

5037
02:00:49,591 --> 02:00:50,610
I think that it,

5038
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:51,450
if,

5039
02:00:51,450 --> 02:00:54,870
if I only thought of myself
as a professional athlete
and that was my identity

5040
02:00:54,871 --> 02:00:55,591
was tied up in that,

5041
02:00:55,591 --> 02:00:58,830
I think we see that across the spectrum
of professional athletes in general,

5042
02:00:59,170 --> 02:00:59,590
um,

5043
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:00,570
of people just going,

5044
02:01:00,690 --> 02:01:00,901
hey,

5045
02:01:00,901 --> 02:01:02,580
I'm a pro athlete and the second I'm not,

5046
02:01:02,581 --> 02:01:05,580
even if they banked millions of dollars
as an NBA player or something like that,

5047
02:01:05,581 --> 02:01:09,210
their whole identity disappears
with the feet of athleticism.

5048
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:12,270
I read a really interesting article
today that I was really compelled by

5049
02:01:12,271 --> 02:01:12,601
actually,

5050
02:01:12,601 --> 02:01:16,050
which was a story about Kevin Duran
that was on espn.com this morning.

5051
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:19,620
And it's about him and his business
manager and a couple other guys that have

5052
02:01:19,621 --> 02:01:20,640
kind of gotten around him and like,

5053
02:01:20,641 --> 02:01:20,881
dude,

5054
02:01:20,881 --> 02:01:23,130
you're like one of the best
basketball players in the world,

5055
02:01:23,131 --> 02:01:23,964
MVP.

5056
02:01:24,090 --> 02:01:27,780
But he's already thinking about all the
various things that he's doing in his

5057
02:01:27,781 --> 02:01:28,110
life.

5058
02:01:28,110 --> 02:01:29,820
And what I loved about that
article was they were like,

5059
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:30,211
you know,

5060
02:01:30,211 --> 02:01:32,910
sports center back in
the day used to be guys,

5061
02:01:32,911 --> 02:01:33,270
you know,

5062
02:01:33,270 --> 02:01:34,051
hitting home runs,

5063
02:01:34,051 --> 02:01:34,680
dunking basketballs,

5064
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:35,970
which of course it still is that.

5065
02:01:36,060 --> 02:01:37,410
But they'll intersperse that with like,

5066
02:01:37,530 --> 02:01:38,700
Kevin Durant just made a,

5067
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:39,230
you know,

5068
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:40,880
venture investment in this company,

5069
02:01:40,881 --> 02:01:44,420
or like they're growing this watermelon
water brand or they're this or that.

5070
02:01:44,421 --> 02:01:46,010
And so I think sports,

5071
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:47,870
particularly with the
growth of social media,

5072
02:01:47,871 --> 02:01:48,590
with storytime,

5073
02:01:48,590 --> 02:01:49,131
with media,

5074
02:01:49,131 --> 02:01:49,701
with content,

5075
02:01:49,701 --> 02:01:51,710
with all the other ways
we can share the insights,

5076
02:01:51,711 --> 02:01:52,880
which isn't just the game,

5077
02:01:52,881 --> 02:01:55,280
which isn't just me and
the arena pulling the sled,

5078
02:01:55,490 --> 02:01:57,080
but it's actually a way
to connect with people.

5079
02:01:57,081 --> 02:01:59,900
Whether that's in the sense of Kevin
Durant making incredible venture

5080
02:01:59,901 --> 02:02:03,680
investments in companies or that's with
storytelling that actually reaches,

5081
02:02:03,681 --> 02:02:03,891
you know,

5082
02:02:03,891 --> 02:02:05,060
universal truth with people.

5083
02:02:05,061 --> 02:02:05,241
You know,

5084
02:02:05,241 --> 02:02:09,050
I've got a single mother from Nebraska
reaching out to me and saying like,

5085
02:02:09,051 --> 02:02:09,231
Hey,

5086
02:02:09,231 --> 02:02:11,540
I don't care about
mountains or the outdoors,

5087
02:02:11,541 --> 02:02:14,630
but like I'm going through some hard
stuff like in the middle of the country.

5088
02:02:14,630 --> 02:02:16,610
Being a single mother in
your story connects with me.

5089
02:02:16,611 --> 02:02:19,100
Thank you for giving me the
inspiration to keep pushing forward.

5090
02:02:19,101 --> 02:02:23,960
So for me it extends beyond just this
athlete in this arena because we have all

5091
02:02:23,961 --> 02:02:27,260
these other ways to storytell
to create content to you know,

5092
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,330
and be involved in businesses
and things like that.

5093
02:02:29,331 --> 02:02:30,590
So that's where my mind's at next.

5094
02:02:30,591 --> 02:02:33,830
It hasn't fully crystallized
into the most concrete of plans,

5095
02:02:33,831 --> 02:02:37,070
but the ability to explore all these
different mediums and just having sort of

5096
02:02:37,071 --> 02:02:40,190
the sports be the catalyst for growth in
that way is what I'm really passionate

5097
02:02:40,191 --> 02:02:40,590
about.

5098
02:02:40,590 --> 02:02:41,670
Well that's awesome man.

5099
02:02:41,671 --> 02:02:45,120
And whatever your plans are
of 100% confidence in you,

5100
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:46,320
you're an inspiration man.

5101
02:02:46,321 --> 02:02:47,070
Thank you very much.

5102
02:02:47,070 --> 02:02:47,580
I appreciate it.

5103
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:48,120
Thanks brother.

5104
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:48,851
Really appreciate you,

5105
02:02:48,851 --> 02:02:49,410
man,

5106
02:02:49,410 --> 02:02:53,100
and tell everybody your Instagram how
to get ahold of you on social media.

5107
02:02:53,190 --> 02:02:53,431
Yeah,

5108
02:02:53,431 --> 02:02:54,091
fall along.

5109
02:02:54,091 --> 02:02:55,980
It's just my name at Collin Brady.

5110
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:57,090
I'm also,

5111
02:02:57,091 --> 02:02:58,320
my website is just my name,

5112
02:02:58,321 --> 02:03:00,240
[inaudible] dot com got a list on there.

5113
02:03:00,241 --> 02:03:00,721
Like I said,

5114
02:03:00,721 --> 02:03:02,010
I'm working on a book.

5115
02:03:02,011 --> 02:03:04,650
There's lots of juicy details
that I haven't shared yet,

5116
02:03:04,651 --> 02:03:05,610
so if you're interested in that,

5117
02:03:05,611 --> 02:03:05,791
you know,

5118
02:03:05,791 --> 02:03:06,930
pop your email address in there.

5119
02:03:06,931 --> 02:03:08,760
We'll keep you posted when
that comes out next year,

5120
02:03:08,761 --> 02:03:09,900
but at colony or Brady,

5121
02:03:09,901 --> 02:03:11,280

Beautiful.

Thank you.

5125

Yeah.

5126

Okay.
