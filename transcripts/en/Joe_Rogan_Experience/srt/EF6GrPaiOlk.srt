1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
According to server right now,
lots to look at in this room to lots of 

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,170
skulls and things we can.
This is a,

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,270
a video that someone did with Greg 
Giraldo,

4
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:22,271
Drag Greg Giraldo doing standup and 
ranting while they played music in the 

5
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:22,271
back

6
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:25,150
ground for those you don't know,
that didn't know a great draw.

7
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:26,800
The overdosed.
And uh,

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,880
today he died.
Okay.

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,580
Okay.
Okay.

10
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,300
So if you didn't know Greg Giraldo,
very funny,

11
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,550
very smart,
very clever.

12
00:04:58,551 --> 00:05:00,110
Standup comedian,
uh,

13
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,570
passed away and they're there talking 
about it on the news today.

14
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:05,720
So I guess it's official.
Sucks.

15
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,730
Sucks.
What can you say?

16
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,160
He's a very nice guy.
I didn't know him that well.

17
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:12,590
I knew who I was on news radio.
He was on a show,

18
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,780
um,
I forget the name of it,

19
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,240
but his set was right down the street 
from mindset.

20
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,030
So I hung out with them,
you know,

21
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,690
quite a few times.
Super Friendly,

22
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:22,100
very nice guy.
Very smart.

23
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,170
You know,
he just,

24
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:25,460
uh,
I don't know what happened.

25
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,240
I know he had had some substance things 
in the past,

26
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,830
but a thought,
I don't know.

27
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,920
Who knows?
I don't know if this was an accident,

28
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,500
if you know,
if he just was partying,

29
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,010
I don't know,

30
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,320
cm on the roast,
the Hasselhoff.

31
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,370
I know a lot of people noted something 
about him that seemed different than 

32
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,131
normal,
but when they say it seemed very coked 

33
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:51,071
up coked up the quote unquote style 
wise.

34
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:52,010
But I,
you know,

35
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:52,770
I,
I didn't,

36
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,670
I wouldn't say that cancer that I looked
coked up and I've never done cocaine.

37
00:05:55,671 --> 00:05:58,100
Exactly.
People always say Rogan get a lay off

38
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,300
the coke zero coke dot.
I've never even done coke once.

39
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:02,360
I've never done coke.
And Tom Green is with us.

40
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,770
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you don't know,

41
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,320
and I'd never done sound of this man's 
voice to my right.

42
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:06,860
Yeah,
this is,

43
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,970
this is this guy to be here.
But uh,

44
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,240
but it was nice to be able to listen to 
some of his comedy today on this.

45
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

46
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:19,490
It's mostly a sad occasion.
He has stuff.

47
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,560
He was a good dude.
He was awesome on roasts,

48
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:26,561
on rose who would destroy guys just 
perfectly where there was nothing they 

49
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:31,091
could do.
The leary did that to him on tough 

50
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:31,091
crowd.
Yeah.

51
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,470
That was the most amazing thing I've 
ever seen on video.

52
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:38,471
And he wasn't even an asshole about it.
He could have been way more of an 

53
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:38,471
asshole about it.
He was actually,

54
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:41,720
he did it with a lot of reserve,
you know,

55
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,550
he was a very nice guy.

56
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,610
It's been a tough year for.
Could Robert Schimmel passed away as 

57
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:48,610
well and.
Yeah.

58
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,920
No,
I,

59
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,650
I just,
uh,

60
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:56,651
you know,
can I change the topic now because I'm 

61
00:06:56,651 --> 00:07:00,860
getting upset if you get me upset.
I have to say our sponsor were sponsored

62
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:02,180
by fleshlight.
Yes.

63
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,810
Yeah,
I know.

64
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,490
It's A.
First of all,

65
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,550
this is cool to be here.
It's exciting to be here.

66
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,440
Well,
the reason for having me up to the show.

67
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,450
Thank you for being our mascot.
If it wasn't for you,

68
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:13,220
I would've never even thought to have 
done this.

69
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,740
And I went over to your house when you 
have me over your house for your show.

70
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:18,680
And he has.
This is what we're doing here.

71
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,390
We have like a couch rest with 
microphones.

72
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:22,750
We have a desk that I bought at z 
Gallerie.

73
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,990
Yeah,
this is awesome.

74
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,080
It's fucking as low rent as you can get 
this cool logic tech,

75
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,620
webcam.

76
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,070
But Tom has like a serious,
serious setup at his place.

77
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,440
His place is.
Don't be showing everybody our secrets,

78
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:34,310
man.
But this is,

79
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:36,710
this is a whole different system you 
guys have here,

80
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:38,520
which is cool though.
It's cool to watch and see.

81
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,580
I'm seeing how you're broadcasting here.
Our audio is terrible for the longest 

82
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:43,790
time,
so we had to tighten it up.

83
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,280
So uh,
people complained and we listened.

84
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:49,370
So we went out and bought all this 
fucking crazy equipment and we've got it

85
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:50,840
down.
Now we have new microphones,

86
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:52,010
but just try them yesterday.
Oh,

87
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:57,011
these are new microphones.
Is that we went to mix up the mix use 

88
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:59,230
for sure.
Fifty eight.

89
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,960
I don't remember the exact.
It's silver or something?

90
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,620
Sure,
sure,

91
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:06,330
sure.
Make sure smp,

92
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,650
look that up on Google.
Everybody.

93
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,480
We are now on some audio technica 
microphones and seem to be much better 

94
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,460
on my show.

95
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,460
I don't have the headphones because we 
were trying to make it like it's not a 

96
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:21,560
radio show.
This is like a radio show.

97
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,810
I did a radio show in college at Ottawa 
University at ch.

98
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,900
You owe 89 point one FM.
Look that up.

99
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,220
It's just an element to the 
conversation.

100
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:34,470
When you hear each other's voice and 
hear your voice right there in your ear,

101
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:35,830
it's like you're.
You're,

102
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,930
you're sure secret is definitely the 
double cassette player that we used to 

103
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,090
though.
What's that?

104
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:46,140
Doubled our secrets are tech secrets of 
how we run this laser disc players and 

105
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:55,211
devil crap they got running.
They're running youtube videos off on a 

106
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:56,340
track and a battery operated only.
You don't want any interference.

107
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,870
It's,
it's very,

108
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,610
um,
what's the word?

109
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,630
When something's all helter skelter,
we're a gorilla smorgasbord of wires to 

110
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,180
ridiculous pile of shit together.
No previous knowledge.

111
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,710
You could see the evolution of the 
podcast like,

112
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:17,580
like Amoebas becoming fish and you can 
watch the whole thing.

113
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,220
We owe it all to Amazon,
to Amazon.com

114
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:21,690
one click as a motherfucker.
You know,

115
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,710
what do you need?
We need one of these.

116
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:23,880
Bam,
but this is fun.

117
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:24,770
Like I didn't,
I didn't,

118
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,780
I didn't in college,
I did my radio show right in it with a 

119
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:29,780
phone in show and we'd go,
go.

120
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,480
I'd go there every Friday night at 
midnight.

121
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:33,480
It was called the midnight caller.
I did the show for six years.

122
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,460
Uh,
not,

123
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,720
not even when I was in high school.
And then after,

124
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:41,721
when I was in community college,
I took a television broadcasting at 

125
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:43,410
Algonquin college in Ottawa,
Canada,

126
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,330
named after the Algonquin Indians.

127
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,780
Now I'm,
I've always been curious about 

128
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:50,780
television broadcasting.
When you take a course like that,

129
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,071
what do they have you do?
Do you pretend to be like a newscaster 

130
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:55,071
or.
It was mostly,

131
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:56,970
it's mostly technical,
like it wasn't on camera.

132
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,720
There was one on camera course,
but it was mostly like editing,

133
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,610
video editing,
lighting,

134
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,930
photography,
how to work a video camera,

135
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,750
how to set all your technical stuff.
And we had,

136
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,110
we had,
we had one broadcast news writing course

137
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,700
and we had,
uh,

138
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,140
some single camera video production and 
film type courses,

139
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,280
but it was mostly tech.
Well,

140
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,300
mostly technical.
It must be hard as fuck to keep up.

141
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,540
Like if you,
if you learn how to video edit from a 

142
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:29,540
few years ago,
you know,

143
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,640
graduated a few years ago now you go to 
today we were learning how to do it on 

144
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,390
three quarter inch video cassette.
The video tapes are this big.

145
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,930
You put them in this job and it's like,
you know,

146
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,600
come to a b roll too to videotapes.
Then it moved.

147
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:46,050
Then we got high eight.
This was before computers editing,

148
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,740
computer editing.
You know there was,

149
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,130
they had abbots and stuff,
but not at the school.

150
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:52,470
They were too expensive at that point.
I edited it ever paintbrush.

151
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,770
Paintbrush.
Oh yeah.

152
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:55,320
Starting off the paint brush.
It's really.

153
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,500
Movies on paintbrush is unbelievable.
What you can do now,

154
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,970
right?
That's what's so exciting.

155
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:02,130
A fucking iphone.
That's the most incredible thing.

156
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:04,460
You can produce something attached.
Music to it.

157
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,800
Edit it all on your phone or your 
fucking phone man.

158
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,690
D,
it's amazing.

159
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:11,190
It's like weird.
We're in strange,

160
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:16,191
strange times.
Know I'm getting the new iphone within 

161
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:16,350
the next couple days just because I am 
my friend.

162
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,260
Just got it and I'm jealous.
Yeah.

163
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,860
It's an envious thing.
That's.

164
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:22,740
So that's the motherfucker have device.

165
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,300
He picks it up.
He's shooting.

166
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,790
Hi def video.
You know you can talk.

167
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,040
You can touch screen.
Oh you have when you touch the screen 

168
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,670
and you've got one already to non Brian 
and are super.

169
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,380
Do you have one too?
I have the old oldest iphone.

170
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,560
My iphone is the old one.
Oh,

171
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:45,780
you got it.
He has a crank on it.

172
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:50,781
Man.
That thing runs on wood loan from your 

173
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:52,500
resolutions to 60 photos are insane.
Unbelievable.

174
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:57,501
Yeah.
It's just amazing that we've got a 

175
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:57,501
device like that.
You know?

176
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:59,410
I've got no doubt that is some serious 
star trek shale.

177
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,560
It slowly crept up on us from the 
Motorola Razor to a Microsoft office 

178
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,690
wants and then when it gets this iphone,
I mean that is a fucking home computer.

179
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,550
I can no longer be proud of this.
This way.

180
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:14,551
I used to feel about this.
Well it still allows some old long as 

181
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:14,551
you keep the case on a piece.

182
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,120
A lot of people swear on the show.
Yeah.

183
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,130
He can swim.
Some old fucker says some old piece of 

184
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,240
shit is what this is.
That's a sad thing about the analogy and

185
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,710
that's only a few months old,
right?

186
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,120
This is two years old.
Soundboards.

187
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,340
Have you played these soundboards?
No.

188
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:30,990
Oh,
you know,

189
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,530
I did.
I did.

190
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,870
The imt pain.
Yes.

191
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,470
Download.
I enjoy that.

192
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,760
I enjoy doing the imt pain APP.
We're talking obscure iphone apps.

193
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,780
Yeah,
that's a good one.

194
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:45,781
It's an auto tune.
So you've always some from your time in 

195
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:49,981
broadcasting school to,
to now you've always been really 

196
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:50,680
involved in the technology of the,
behind the scenes stuff.

197
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:55,681
You've always,
you're not kind of figured I was when I 

198
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:58,051
was,
I was in high school and I thought it'd 

199
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:00,100
be fun to do a TV show someday,
is basically what I thought.

200
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,330
I was watching David Letterman at night,
you know,

201
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,850
and I was thinking,
man,

202
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:06,280
that would be the most fun thing to ever
do.

203
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,610
I was thinking,
you know,

204
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,920
and little did I know,
but that it's a lot of fun doing this 

205
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,300
stuff.
But the thing is,

206
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,170
as you know,
sometimes sometimes not,

207
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,140
but you know,
the thing is,

208
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:20,640
is,
uh,

209
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:22,380
you know,
so you know,

210
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,120
no one's ever going to let me do a show.
I'm going to have to go do a show at the

211
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,340
public access station,
will make her own show,

212
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,330
you know,
we went,

213
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,340
I went to school and learned how to make
the videos,

214
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,190
went to the public access station,
started the show,

215
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,750
lasted for seven years when you were 
very popular because of your public 

216
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,600
access show.
That's what got you started off.

217
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,640
You're also rap star to them.
That's basically what got picked up by 

218
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,730
MTV was the public access show.
And it had a Canadian rap group.

219
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:47,160
Yeah.
That was before the public access,

220
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:47,330
right.

221
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,420
That was one of.
Okay.

222
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,630
Wrapping people.
They see this man and he's very white 

223
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,870
and he has a beard and he's very.
I'm from Ottawa,

224
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,790
Ottawa living.
Very polite.

225
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,360
No,
no.

226
00:13:58,361 --> 00:13:59,980
He's a bad ass rapper.
Yeah.

227
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,430
Tom Green wrap his fucking ass was 
listening to your shit today,

228
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:08,431
man.
You have anything on youtube that you 

229
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:08,431
can throw it right here?
Let me hear it.

230
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,150
Let me hear a Tom Green grass.
I'd love rap music,

231
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:10,570
man.
Yeah.

232
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,240
I take shit for it.
I make beats and I have.

233
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:16,870
I've also see that's the other thing.
Before I started doing the video editing

234
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:18,460
and wanted to do that,
I make beats at home.

235
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:22,000
So I had like my own little Atari 
computer hooked up to a,

236
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,150
a Chi sampler and a keyboard and camera 
with you playing it right now.

237
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,150
Oh,
this is,

238
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:29,560
this is a,
you're a,

239
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,370
you're playing something.
It actually,

240
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,460
it's,
it's Kinda funny when you play music 

241
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:36,460
because we recorded the song,
you know,

242
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,010
20,
22 years ago or something like that.

243
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,300
And we were kids,
teenagers,

244
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,950
teenagers.
And this is us walking around downtown.

245
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:53,130
What is you tell me what it to you.
I'm the one in the red jacket and I made

246
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:58,871
the music,
which is essentially a sample and you're

247
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,090
the one who wants to call it,
but you miss it.

248
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,000
Give me a.
that's my friend Greg.

249
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,460
Greg Campbell.
And uh,

250
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:08,960
and we uh,
guys are from Ottawa,

251
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,090
from Ottawa.
And uh,

252
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,050
so it was fun.
We got,

253
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,960
we actually got a record deal when we 
were in high school and the video,

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,600
the song and the video was playing on tv
and everything.

255
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,780
It was a very exciting time,
uh,

256
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,270
for two young rappers from Ottawa.
A good.

257
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,240
This video will won the 1992,
a much music video award.

258
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,810
Cmv a award you performed live on the,
uh,

259
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,230
on the CMV va awards.
And I covered myself with a shaving 

260
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,310
cream on for no reason and got up in the
lens of the camera,

261
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:47,180
covered myself in shaving cream.
So we weren't like the sort of hard core

262
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,750
auto tune this yet.
Have you tried to like that's rapping?

263
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,120
Walking through the grocery store.
I love public enemy,

264
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,750
but this is,
this is old though.

265
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,690
Getting here.
My new,

266
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,320
my new shit.
I can we get some new shit?

267
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,980
I Dunno.
Probably floating around.

268
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,310
I don't know.
This is,

269
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,390
this isn't the one to look at it.
This is the one to look at it.

270
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,070
This is really good.
Ben.

271
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,050
I've had,
I've had a lot of fun,

272
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,020
surprising rappers that have come on my 
web shop.

273
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,890
Actually,
that's a funny clip you could show.

274
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,700
Oh,
well you,

275
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:30,701
and maybe you can go look at it on 
Youtube,

276
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,980
go to this place because he starts 
cracking up

277
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,210
in sort of a funny moment,
you know,

278
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,980
where he's uh,
and uh,

279
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,510
you know,
what?

280
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,340
Did you initially want to be a rapper 
before you became a comedian?

281
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,360
No,
not really.

282
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:44,930
No.
I was like,

283
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:49,240
I was in high school and uh,
I thought it was a,

284
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,040
it was a fun thing to do on stage at the
assemblies was,

285
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:52,430
was,
you know,

286
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,690
you had to,
you know,

287
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:55,870
the data band battle of the bands 
nitrate,

288
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,270
it was an excuse to get up on stage.
So we made this rap group.

289
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,980
I liked listening to it,
you know,

290
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:02,640
I was listening to like,
you know,

291
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,130
nobody knew what rap music was in my 
high school.

292
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,280
Everyone was listening to mainstream 
music.

293
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:12,230
I was listening to boogie down 
productions,

294
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,700
Nwa,
public enemy,

295
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,340
you know,
which was not tribe called quest.

296
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,940
These groups weren't really mainstream 
yet in,

297
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,560
on the radio in Canada and in the 
eighties and nineties.

298
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,970
But uh,
but yeah,

299
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:27,971
so,
but you know what I was thinking about 

300
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:27,971
this the other day,
rap music back then is kind of like,

301
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,640
it kind of provided what the Internet 
provides now,

302
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:34,700
which is a glimpse into other parts of 
the world,

303
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,270
other places,
you know,

304
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,040
here,
here it was,

305
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,100
we were in Canada and we're listening to
these songs coming out in New York,

306
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:45,101
coming out.
You'll boogie down productions of the 

307
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:47,890
South Bronx and we're listening to them 
telling all these tales of life on the 

308
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:47,890
streets in the South Bronx and you're 
listening to this,

309
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,890
you're going on a cassette,
you know,

310
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:50,180
and you're listening to in your walkman

311
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,820
on the way to school and no criminal 
minded the record and you're like,

312
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:55,320
Oh man,
listen to these stories,

313
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:57,040
you know.
And so that's A.

314
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Yeah,
I was thinking about that driving over 

315
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:02,640
here today.
It's Kinda,

316
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,730
it's,
it's kind of sad because in a way that 

317
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:04,730
might be something that disappears from 
music now,

318
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,220
you know,
because of the Internet,

319
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:06,900
you know,
maybe that's going to screw up music.

320
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:12,370
Let's not be negative as well because we
don't have to go to music now to get 

321
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:12,370
those kinds of,
you know,

322
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,230
store.
I guess we would listen to them on the 

323
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,281
Internet.
I think that anything good is going to 

324
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,171
stick around.
There's not going to be anything that's 

325
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:21,171
awesome that's going to go away.
You know,

326
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:21,171
everybody's like,
oh,

327
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:25,521
this is going to be the death of music.
How can anything be the death of music 

328
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:25,521
when everybody loves music.

329
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,330
That's ridiculous.
It's like he'll be a desk of comedy.

330
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,510
I guess I just sort of more and more 
curious to see how it will affect it or 

331
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:32,520
how it'll evolve.
It'll be good.

332
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,140
It'll be good.
Well,

333
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:39,141
now there's so many more places that 
people will want to make music and just 

334
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:40,200
distribute their music to have access.
It's perfect.

335
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,540
It just us,
we can do this.

336
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,810
The fact that we can do this and just 
broadcast talking over the Internet.

337
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,860
This is just.
You can.

338
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,530
You can become famous from bands.
That little kid,

339
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,920
the one that's saying that covered the 
one in l one the l and gave a record 

340
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,550
deal.
That was brilliant.

341
00:18:56,551 --> 00:19:01,551
Dude,
that was like some that gave me 

342
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:01,551
goosebumps.
I listened to that kid saying it gave me

343
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:02,340
goosebumps.
I mean my whole family listen to it.

344
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,300
I was like,
this is incredible.

345
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,000
It's so fucking talented and he's in a.
he's in a high school.

346
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:09,140
Like not even was it even high school?
No.

347
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,000
Middle School.
And what was cool about the video was it

348
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:17,001
was,
it was all girls listening in the 

349
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:17,001
background.
You could see the girls were into it.

350
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:17,970
They were crushing,
crushing on him.

351
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:19,620
That was cool.
Couldn't help themselves.

352
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,680
They were like,
they're a little moistening while 

353
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:24,680
they're sitting up there like 13.
It was,

354
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,820
it was interesting.
This one girl was going,

355
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,620
they couldn't believe it,
you know,

356
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,890
that's sort of the that we have to play 
play that man.

357
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:33,440
Find that shit and that sort of.
We,

358
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,220
we're not gonna play the whole thing for
people who does this.

359
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:38,030
The fucking music show.
Yeah.

360
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:43,031
You know what?
Fuck ups the go find it in high school 

361
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:46,041
though to get up on stage.
Wasn't an ellen say something or do 

362
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,641
something that everybody in the entire 
school know staring at your leg and 

363
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:53,871
Michael J.
Fox in the back of the future playing 

364
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:53,871
the guitar on the stage like you're from
outer space or something.

365
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:56,340
Weird pressure that is for children to 
want to stand out like that.

366
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:57,990
Like that's got to be so strange for 
kids.

367
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:02,991
I don't remember the feeling myself,
but if you wanted to be some sort of an 

368
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:06,741
act or something and you were 10 and you
were in school and you saw some girl 

369
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:07,920
that was on a show and she was 10 and 
you're like,

370
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,660
what the fuck?
How come I can't be on that?

371
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,550
Yeah,
exactly.

372
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,750
It's a terrible way to be raising kids,
thinking about getting the most 

373
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,190
attention possible for almost nothing,
like instantaneously become famous.

374
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,950
So everything that your parents,
you know,

375
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,030
all the character that gets developed 
from hard work.

376
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:25,610
That's all nonsense.
I made it already banged.

377
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,280
Shut up 14 and made it.
Yeah.

378
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,410
They put too much pressure on people.
Look at Lindsay Lohan,

379
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:33,360
especially in this day and age now where
yeah,

380
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:33,960
you're seeing it.

381
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,500
It's in your face all the time and oh 
man,

382
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,800
you could swear dude all the fucking 
time and shoving down their throats.

383
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,810
Okay.
Shrill.

384
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,750
We're shoving in.
The strangest thing about Hollywood high

385
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,410
was tricking the very people that make 
it,

386
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,490
you know,
there's the grand conspiracy theory is 

387
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:53,490
that like,
man,

388
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,891
you know,
the Hollywood is trying to condition us 

389
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:59,640
to be like,
like subservient to our government man 

390
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,550
and be patriotic,
but no,

391
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,770
Hollywood is giving you what you want to
see.

392
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,490
Holly was given you what you want to see
and they're doing what they like to.

393
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,610
They're,
they're making the kind of stupid shit 

394
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:11,610
that they like to watch.
You know,

395
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,940
it's like the people that are creating 
it or just as much of a victim of the 

396
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,420
conditioning as the people that they're 
selling it to.

397
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,150
People don't realize that they think 
it's some grand scheme.

398
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,960
No supply and demand.
Yeah.

399
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,040
People want to see a sex tapes and then 
see the people go do shows and watch 

400
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:31,180
their lives and sort of see everything 
and know everything.

401
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:33,130
Right.
Do You Watch Jersey shore?

402
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,280
I,
I've seen it.

403
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,590
I've only seen him once,
but I,

404
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,210
I enjoyed it a lot.
I found it.

405
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:38,240
I found it very.
Uh,

406
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,170
I laughed a lot watching the show.
I can see why people watch.

407
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,480
Those guys are pretty funny too.
Right?

408
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,040
Is that,
that's,

409
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:49,150
that's.
I've only seen it once ever hamming it 

410
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:49,150
up to the camera there having a good 
time.

411
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,530
You're watching people,
you know,

412
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:53,500
you're being voyeuristic right into a 
completely different world.

413
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,980
Like I'm so stuck with the hills though 
and everything like that.

414
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:58,510
I don't buy the Jersey shore.
Like,

415
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:01,930
I almost think everything's fake now.
Typically it's all set up,

416
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,730
but I don't care.

417
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,260
It's encouraging bad behavior.
There's still,

418
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,020
even if it's fake,
it's like these people like wow,

419
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:08,960
you,
you watch it.

420
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:11,770
It's like watching a national geographic
special on some fucking tribe.

421
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:15,010
Did they found the jungle seemed like 
humans,

422
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,120
but it's pretty funny man.
And all they're trying to do is get the 

423
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,830
dicks.
It's really kind of funny because it's 

424
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,830
real.
It's real.

425
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,290
I mean that really is what that guy's 
doing is just trying to fucking get it 

426
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:28,290
every night.
Different girls all over the place.

427
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,480
He's showing you his abs and he's going 
to clubs at girls are going,

428
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,530
I mean,
it's working,

429
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,080
it's working.
He's pulling it off and it's working.

430
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,900
I think the thing that's bizarre about 
all the reality TV,

431
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,500
those not to overanalyze it.
I guess maybe I,

432
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,980
maybe I'd be overanalyzing and at that 
point,

433
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,470
but we're talking about my broadcast and
course they taught us about,

434
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:46,670
you know,
documentation and making documentary.

435
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:51,670
We had a documentary film of course,
and they talk about when you put a 

436
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:51,670
camera on something,
right,

437
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:51,760
it changes what you're filming,
right?

438
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:56,761
So you can never really make a true 
documentary of anything because as soon 

439
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:57,850
as you put the camera on it,
it's going to change what's going on.

440
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,980
Like in this case,
you put the camera on all these kids in 

441
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:02,980
Jersey shore,
right.

442
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:02,980
And then are like,
okay,

443
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,991
we gotta go crazy for the camera.
So they go for getting in fights or 

444
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:07,180
true.
So then it's going to.

445
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,280
And then people are gonna Watch that and
it's gonna get worse and worse than 

446
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,461
that,
people are gonna have to get more 

447
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:14,461
fights.
People going to start,

448
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:14,461
you know we're going to snuff film 
television.

449
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,710
I don't think we'll get to that point.
People don't want to see that kind of 

450
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:19,710
negative stuff.
They want us,

451
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,990
they want to be fascinated by orange 
will recall faces of death.

452
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,320
They want the want the couple to make 
out and then close the door.

453
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,920
That's where they want it to stop.
Yeah.

454
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,870
It's all fascinating to me,
man,

455
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,340
because it's so easy to change behavior 
by just putting a camera on it.

456
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:36,160
If that's really the case,
if all you have to do is add a camera at

457
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,560
the fact that other people are going to 
get to see it and it changes everything.

458
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,880
No,
they're still doing this.

459
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:41,830
Even if they're faking it and acting it 
out.

460
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:43,990
I don't care.
You're still doing all this stuff on the

461
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:45,680
show and to me,
look,

462
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:50,681
it's.
It's like some sort of a national 

463
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:50,681
geographic special.
It really is.

464
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:50,850
I want to watch it more.
Yeah.

465
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,640
I can't help myself.
I have to watch it more.

466
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,310
So it really is.
So yeah,

467
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:59,420
they think they just get used to the 
camera and that's just the way they 

468
00:23:59,420 --> 00:23:59,420
would be living life.

469
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,260
I grew up with people like that.
Their chimps,

470
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,310
chimps,
chimps out there with gold chains,

471
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,430
Onga and that is out there running 
around.

472
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,190
Not giving a fuck about how the world 
works.

473
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,890
That's exactly what it's like on the 
Jersey.

474
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,140
There's.
I knew dudes from back when I was in 

475
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,660
high school that did not give a fuck how
the world works.

476
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,740
Yeah.
All they want to do.

477
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:19,790
They worked,
they did.

478
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,970
They were electricians.
They would work and then when they get 

479
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,401
off work they'd want to get fucked up 
and go get laid and they didn't know 

480
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:27,401
anything.
They didn't know what was going on.

481
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:28,730
They have no idea.
Didn't give a fuck.

482
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:33,731
Did pay attention.
What am I gonna do with my fall fucking 

483
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:33,731
politics?
Mcguire.

484
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:33,731
I'm getting my Dick Suck.
Come up.

485
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:34,280
What am I going to do here?
Oh my God.

486
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,680
I do follow politics.

487
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,790
That shit.
That shit ain't real.

488
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,750
Yo.
I said I really.

489
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,950
I grew up with dudes like that.
So when I see them putting cameras on 

490
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:44,950
people like that and go,
oh no,

491
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,430
no,
they gave these savages a fucking 

492
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:49,430
camera.
They gave them air time.

493
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:53,590
Actually now I'm starting to.
I'm a little mad at myself that I 

494
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,321
haven't watched it more.
I think I've been withdrawing a little 

495
00:24:56,321 --> 00:25:00,011
bit from a television need to last 
couple of years purposely not watching 

496
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:03,030
anything other than CNN actually is 
pretty well.

497
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:08,790
I don't even watch American.
I watched American idol because 

498
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:08,790
everybody watched it.
I don't watch that.

499
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,830
I don't watch that.
I don't want no more.

500
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,320
I used to like watching the people suck 
in the beginning,

501
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,600
but then I get them.
I'm like,

502
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,720
what's wrong with you?
You sick?

503
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,100
Fuck.
You want to watch people fail.

504
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,140
Was like,
oh wow.

505
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,020
How was that fun?
You know,

506
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,580
every now and then you see one.
That's brilliant.

507
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:21,200
Well guess what?
I'll find that one on youtube.

508
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,690
Okay.
Tell me some amazing thing like that.

509
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:25,610
Susan,
what was her name?

510
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,510
The one could really sang Susan.
Susan Boyle,

511
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:30,060
Boyle.
Susan.

512
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,050
Susan Boyle.
Yeah.

513
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,270
That was fascinating.
I mean that was,

514
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,160
that was really incredible.
I mean,

515
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:39,161
she had an amazing voice,
but how many hours do I have to sit 

516
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:41,411
through of bullshit before I get to that
and it was the and it was a perfect 

517
00:25:41,411 --> 00:25:42,500
moment and it was just sort of the 
perfect,

518
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:45,890
perfect thing that happened here yet.
But the thing is I don't like to.

519
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:50,891
I used to like the beginning when they 
were a fucking up to at the beginning 

520
00:25:50,891 --> 00:25:53,861
and they making fools of themselves,
but now it seems like the people coming 

521
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:55,550
in are coming and I can't watch that 
anymore.

522
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Yeah.
And another musical sucks on the radio 

523
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:00,560
now because it all comes out of that 
same thing.

524
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,500
Right?
It's all coming out of that same funnel.

525
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:08,501
It's like,
well we gotta we gotta do a really good 

526
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:08,501
Jefferson airplane impression,
you know,

527
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:08,900
you know,
you think so.

528
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,910
I can't stand them.
The new music.

529
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,530
There's always good stuff,
man.

530
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,300
You just got to find it.
There's just so much.

531
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,320
Well that's the problem.
See,

532
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:16,350
I don't know how to find it.
I,

533
00:26:16,351 --> 00:26:18,260
I agree.
I know there is good stuff because there

534
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:20,270
is good stuff that I find in here 
sometimes,

535
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,450
but just going through life now,
like when you're walking and you're in 

536
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,050
an elevator or you're walking through a 
mall or you're listening to the radio or

537
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:29,210
the mainstream stuff,
it's all the shit.

538
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,410
Yeah,
that's true.

539
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:31,770
You don't have to.
I don't.

540
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,060
I don't listen to college radio anymore.
I don't know what the station is and so 

541
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,560
I don't know how to find the cool 
underground stuff.

542
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,490
He'd do Pandora all.
Yeah,

543
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:41,360
I do.
I do do that,

544
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:43,920
but I don't know what to type into a 
search because people

545
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,060
know when you're.
When you're,

546
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,250
when you're in school and stuff and 
you're around people,

547
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:49,080
but I mean I've met him in my living 
room.

548
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,310
The loss of the DJ,
the loss of the Dj,

549
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:57,870
the Dj to me is one of the things I miss
the most about the radio,

550
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,630
about growing up and listening to the 
radio.

551
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,200
I would listen to guys and listen to the
shit that they like to listen to and you

552
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:06,770
were cool guys and they would like.
There was a,

553
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:11,810
Charles Laquidara,
was this guy who used to do the big 

554
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,331
mattress show on,
I think it was WBCN BCRC cozy back in 

555
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:19,431
Boston and it was like this morning show
where he would go on and it was a comedy

556
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,630
show and they would fuck around,
but he plays songs too,

557
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,960
you know,
and he played the shit that he wanted 

558
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:26,960
here.
That's funny.

559
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,740
I like that guy's point of view and 
that's the music he likes.

560
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,400
There's this guy in my field toe mark 
parenteau was the afternoon Dj and he 

561
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:39,651
was like a big supporter of comedy too.
We always did like comedy competitions 

562
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:39,870
and shit and he would play the shit that
he wanted to hear.

563
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,730
I'm like,
you got a sense of like,

564
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,730
this cool guy likes this music.
You know,

565
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,630
it tells you,
you know why he likes this song,

566
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,400
what's so bad ass about it?
Check it out.

567
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,380
Bam.
And he plays it.

568
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,310
It's like you're having a show that's a 
show.

569
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,400
That's a show.
What they're doing now is just sticking 

570
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,091
all sorts of songs that they think they 
can get you to pay attention to 

571
00:27:59,091 --> 00:27:59,091
together.
And then,

572
00:27:59,091 --> 00:27:59,700
you know,
they throw him in there,

573
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,960
there's no one,
there's no one personality behind it.

574
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:05,960
It's not,
there's no radio djs.

575
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,200
The radio djs really have much of a 
choice in what they put on their voice.

576
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,220
You know,
there's an art to being a true fan of 

577
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,651
the music and going out there and 
listening to different stuff and 

578
00:28:18,651 --> 00:28:18,651
collecting your own,
you know,

579
00:28:18,651 --> 00:28:18,960
your own favorites and saying,
look,

580
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,060
this cool shit that I got.
That's what I meant.

581
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:21,990
That's what I'm trying to say.
I'm,

582
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:27,010
it's right there.
Because it's like now you listen to the 

583
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:27,010
radio.
It's all been focus group tested out.

584
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,260
This is this,
this sounds like this,

585
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:30,540
this is so and so from American idol,
American idol.

586
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,990
The sounds like American idol.
This all sounds like a.

587
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,480
and it all sounds the same to me.
Brian and I have very nice sound like an

588
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,010
old guy now.
I sound like an old guy,

589
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:39,780
right?
Because I just turned nine years old.

590
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:43,290
I just turned 39 and I got one like an 
old guy one year,

591
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,880
but you know from 40.

592
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:50,090
And I'm starting to sound like my dad 
saying none of the music today is good 

593
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:50,090
to everybody.
It was back when I was.

594
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,600
Everybody says that,
but there's good stuff.

595
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:53,160
You just have to find it.
It's just hard to do.

596
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,490
Brian and I have very similar tastes and
Brian is always fun to me.

597
00:28:56,491 --> 00:28:58,130
Cool Shit.
Who's always fighting.

598
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,060
He's like,
he's a internet fiend,

599
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,390
so he's always connecting.
So I always look forward to it.

600
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,840
He knew cool shit is fun man.
There's a lot of it out there.

601
00:29:06,841 --> 00:29:08,760
It's just there's so much to sift 
through.

602
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,480
So much data and slash or helps me the 
most and that,

603
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:16,481
you know,
just being at a club and hearing a 

604
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:16,800
really good dj and I'll hook up sam,
Sam or whatever,

605
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:19,290
and then I shit finds me some crashes 
and if you don't know,

606
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,920
if you don't have that program on your 
phone,

607
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,700
it's the most incredible thing.
You wouldn't even believe it's real.

608
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,770
You hold your phone up to a speaker.
Oh,

609
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,910
he plays the song and it tells you what 
the song is.

610
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:31,860
And unless you buy it on your phone,
sound snap.

611
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:33,960
Actually let you a song.
So He'd be like,

612
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,350
I told that to edit and he's like,
that's impossible.

613
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,920
It's just trying to tell me about music 
chords,

614
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,230
that and that and this.
I'm like,

615
00:29:40,231 --> 00:29:41,410
I'm telling you,
they do it.

616
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,220
That's what it is.

617
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,860
It's just wave forms,
you know,

618
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:46,000
that's what it does.
It takes the,

619
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,670
takes the song,
it makes it a wave form,

620
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,090
like a picture,
like a Jpeg,

621
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,900
and it just puts it in a database.
Analyze.

622
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,820
Yeah,
analyze it.

623
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:56,821
And it's like matching fingerprints.
It's actually pretty brilliant how it 

624
00:29:56,821 --> 00:30:00,031
works and it's not that big of a deal.
If we even get to know when the 

625
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:02,000
computers take over,
uh,

626
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,490
we even going to know we're not even 
going to know.

627
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,720
No,
they're going to take over.

628
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:11,570
So Dave started with the Tia 81 I think.
What are you doing today?

629
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,250
It's real number.
How would you like to play again,

630
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,170
analyze it in seconds and tell you what 
the song is,

631
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,490
listened to it,
analyze it,

632
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:25,000
break it down to a piece of data and 
then spit it back at you with options to

633
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:28,960
purchase it all in seconds.
And they can do it for,

634
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,980
you know,
practically every fucking song there is 

635
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,851
out there.
I've never had a failing me wants to 

636
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:35,851
have you ever had a failing once.
But it was also like a remix version.

637
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:36,610
So it was other shit mixed up.

638
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,480
You hear a song,
you like it,

639
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:43,510
you want,
you want to know what it is you have 

640
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,510
polled Shazamm up.
It tells you what it is,

641
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,980
downloads it and buys it

642
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:49,020
for you.
You start asking it in your car seconds 

643
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,020
later.
If your car's Bluetooth,

644
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,130
Bam.
It's planning your.

645
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:54,330
That's amazing.
I want bumblebee song because it's like 

646
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:54,330
when I,
when I was,

647
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:54,330
when I was doing my wrap group back 
then,

648
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,260
I was a teenager,
he was,

649
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,300
we were back then,
it was all about sampling loops,

650
00:30:57,301 --> 00:30:59,070
right?
So you'd find you'd hear loops of music,

651
00:30:59,071 --> 00:31:04,071
breaks of music.
So we'd go into the radio station all 

652
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:04,071
the time.
I was looking for a cool beat breaks and

653
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,640
stuff.
So you hear that you'd always hear stuff

654
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:07,200
and you wouldn't know what to,
you know what it was.

655
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,170
Then you do that,
you know,

656
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,020
they don't.
But,

657
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:10,170
you know,
let me ask you a question.

658
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:11,520
Can I ask you a question?
Okay.

659
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,940
Because I've noticed you have a lot of 
Buddhas around the house,

660
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,670
right?
Yeah.

661
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,680
It said.
Okay.

662
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,590
Sure,
sure.

663
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,050
Um,
because I had a Buddha and uh,

664
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,810
I've,
I've,

665
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,200
I really like them a lot.
I had one at my house.

666
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,450
It was when I,
when I,

667
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,430
when I got my house,
it was there already.

668
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,230
I didn't get the Buddha.
The Buddha was there already.

669
00:31:31,231 --> 00:31:32,940
It was a fountain,
right?

670
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,600
Because on a pole it was a big 
fountains,

671
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:41,010
but the size of that poster there,
big concrete fountain.

672
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,620
And uh,
I had uh,

673
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,600
a meeting one day with a television 
executive at my house.

674
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,650
Okay.
And we went up on the roof of my house 

675
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:53,970
and we had a meeting,
just a discussion,

676
00:31:53,971 --> 00:31:56,190
having a beer,
talking about some ideas,

677
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,760
television ideas.
And we hear this enormous crash.

678
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:05,060
We go down and the Buddha has just,
for whatever reason the pole is on this 

679
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,590
metal pole smashed,
it has fallen,

680
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,780
it is smashed into a million pieces and 
gone into my swimming pool.

681
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,780
And I'm looking at it and I'm just 
thinking,

682
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,220
okay,
apart from like,

683
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,460
I really miss the thing.
Is that a sign of.

684
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,720
No.
Okay,

685
00:32:21,721 --> 00:32:22,080
good.
No,

686
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:27,081
it's not like swimming.
There was a donald duck statute's still 

687
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:27,081
a little fall.
And so it's just,

688
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:29,880
there's no magical property to having 
the boot and it's just,

689
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,380
it's just a thing,
a nice thing to look.

690
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:36,420
I am fascinated by ancient Asian artwork
fascinated by Buddhists and tie Buddhas 

691
00:32:37,411 --> 00:32:40,010
and the fact that they've looked that 
way for

692
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,010
hundreds and thousands of years and all 
these different people depict these 

693
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:48,971
things in the different artistic ways.
And that the Buddha is a character of 

694
00:32:48,971 --> 00:32:49,220
peace.
You know,

695
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:54,390
the,
the idea of these Thai Buddhist to me 

696
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:54,390
means a lot to me.
It give it's,

697
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:54,590
it's,
uh,

698
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:59,030
a beautiful artistic representation of 
enlightenment and it's calming,

699
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:02,180
too calming.
I love their art work.

700
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,470
I love Sheeva's.
I love Hindu artwork.

701
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,520
I love,
um,

702
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,810
I love a lot of Thai artwork,
some of the most fascinating stuff.

703
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:13,811
It's one of the coolest things about 
living in La is that you have access to 

704
00:33:13,811 --> 00:33:14,870
all these importers.
They import this really,

705
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,920
um,
a lot of this beautiful hand carved 

706
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,060
stuff from Thailand,
which you guys ever have a mummy?

707
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:25,810
Mummy,
mummy and my house like a dead guy 

708
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,870
wrapped up.
What'd you morbid man?

709
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:27,710
It's like,
why?

710
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:32,770
You know,
I mean I guess if you wanted to like 

711
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,650
have it in glass like in a room 
somewhere and shit too.

712
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,860
Probably so weird.
So weird message you're sending.

713
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,710
I just don't like the smell of embalming
fluid.

714
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,740
What if it's something that's always 
bothered me was like,

715
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:48,420
if you ever heard of that self 
mummification mummification was a 

716
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,661
practice is and it's been done several 
times by these monks and one of the 

717
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:56,420
things they do is they eat nothing but a
very,

718
00:33:56,421 --> 00:34:00,050
very lean foods.
They eat like seeds and nuts and they go

719
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:05,051
through rigorous exercise routines for 
like three years where they virtually 

720
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:07,510
stripped their body of all its fat and 
then they start drinking this,

721
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:12,590
this crazy a tonic that's,
it's like semi poisonous so it doesn't 

722
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:15,860
kill them but it fucks them up nice and 
slowly and it keeps maggots from growing

723
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:17,180
on them.
Get this.

724
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,780
Then they climb into a sarcophagus when 
after they've done this for awhile,

725
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,520
so their bodies like ready to go.

726
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:27,570
They climbing this sarcophagus and they 
close the lid on them and there's just 

727
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,690
an air hole and a bell,
so like the guy in the Lotus position,

728
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:34,970
that new movie with a.
He stays in the Lotus position with the 

729
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:37,940
air hole in the bell and every day if 
he's alive he rings the bell and the day

730
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:42,941
that he doesn't ring the Bell,
they seal the coughing up and then he's 

731
00:34:42,941 --> 00:34:44,290
in there for good and he's mummified.
Why modification?

732
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,580
Why do they do that now?
Because they're fucking nuts.

733
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,130
Where are these guys?
Were they still doing this today?

734
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:54,131
Yeah.
People just legal ramifications for 

735
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:54,131
laws.
Whose laws were.

736
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:57,110
What were they doing?
I believe it's in Tibet.

737
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:04,420
Should actually stop.
This is a campaign to stop this crap.

738
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,470
Brian,
onto Google self memification.

739
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,880
No,
because I know that it's something that 

740
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:12,880
has been done.
They have these mummies,

741
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,770
man,
and they've taken the lids off there.

742
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,570
There sarcophagus and there in the Lotus
position,

743
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:22,571
man,
they're fucking robes on and their 

744
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:24,101
mummies.
It is the creepiest dedication to 

745
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:24,170
whatever it is that you're doing it for.
Fuck.

746
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:25,720
They're taking it to the next level,
man.

747
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,300
Total dedication.
They're taking it.

748
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,320
They're poisoning the maggots.
Okay.

749
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:31,410
How about that?
They're.

750
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,160
They're taking some shit that kills the 
maggots.

751
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,340
Now,
by the way,

752
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,470
I'm reading this on the Internet.
Who knows how much of this is true?

753
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,230
I might be says it's a form of a 
suicide,

754
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,380
so let me ask those suicide.
It takes years,

755
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:48,381
man.
So there is a lot of stuff on the 

756
00:35:48,381 --> 00:35:48,720
Internet that we read that is not true 
and that is true.

757
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,360
Now you were talking about the Ufo was 
last night at your show,

758
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:53,130
which was hilarious by the way,
and that's what it was.

759
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,800
Great running into you over there.
We ran into each other at a club.

760
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,470
J Dot Davis is going doing this little 
club.

761
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,430
What's it called?
The parlor.

762
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,270
The Parlor?
Yep.

763
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,150
On Melrose.
So a fun,

764
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,750
nice little place,
but the AC was out.

765
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:05,270
It was whack.
They were.

766
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,790
It was really cool crowd because even 
though it was like a fucking 100 degrees

767
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:13,791
in there,
like literally it was at least 100 

768
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:13,791
degrees in that room.
I can drink like crazy.

769
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:14,280
It's so high.
It was.

770
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:16,770
The crowd was very polite.
I felt like I was imposing.

771
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,080
Talking to them,
I felt like I felt bad.

772
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:21,660
I felt like I was doing something by 
making them sit there and watch it.

773
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,360
No,
no,

774
00:36:22,361 --> 00:36:23,110
no.
It was hilarious.

775
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:23,950
It was awesome.
It was great.

776
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,020
It was a great surprise.
I didn't know you were coming out.

777
00:36:26,021 --> 00:36:31,021
We've been.
We haven't seen each other in a couple 

778
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,931
of years.
I have a bunch of questions I want to 

779
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:33,931
ask you because I've started trying to 
do standup comedy.

780
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,490
You're up and doing it this year,
but happened to it.

781
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:37,370
I haven't laughed at some of your stuff 
on them and doing it.

782
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,660
I'm not trying to do it.
I'm doing it.

783
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:40,740
God Damn it.
I'm sorry.

784
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,750
No,
I said,

785
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:42,960
I said that.
I said sorry for you.

786
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,430
No.
Yeah,

787
00:36:43,431 --> 00:36:44,880
yeah,
yeah.

788
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:47,070
It's a whole whole new world,
isn't it?

789
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,560
Uh,
it's a very uh,

790
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,160
but I want to ask you some questions 
about that,

791
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,840
but um,
but yeah,

792
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:52,560
so,
uh,

793
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:57,590
I'll ask you right now I guess go for it
or were we going to talk a bit more 

794
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:57,590
about the show last night?

795
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:57,620
Well,
the show last night,

796
00:36:57,621 --> 00:37:02,621
it was a lot of fun.
Bird went up and did a bunch of new 

797
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:02,621
shit.
Oh,

798
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:04,800
and bill burrs,
a comedy central special airs again this

799
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,010
October first,
I believe it is very fun.

800
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:10,110
If you haven't seen it,
check it out and it will be good for him

801
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:15,111
too.
He really wants to get ratings in this 

802
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:15,111
thing because he wants to do more of 
them.

803
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:15,370
And if you're a fan of standup comedy,
Bill Burrs,

804
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:20,390
one of the best.
He's one of the best guys out there 

805
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,071
today.
There's very few guys that like 

806
00:37:22,071 --> 00:37:22,710
consistently nail it the way he does.
He's really good.

807
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,550
He's a really.
I went

808
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:28,030
down there to see bill last night 
because I met him at the Montreal comedy

809
00:37:28,031 --> 00:37:33,031
festival and that this is what's been 
fun about doing standup as I'm getting 

810
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:34,360
to go to a comedy festival and hanging 
out with a bunch of funny people.

811
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:35,850
Everyone's having a good time.
You know,

812
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,290
I've saw Doug Stan hope up at the 
Montreal comedy festival.

813
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,220
He had this awesome party in a carwash,
you know,

814
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,240
it was like a good time.
So he calls it just for spite and he 

815
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,110
does it a po opposing the actual camera.
Right?

816
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,120
That's right.
He's not part of the festival and this 

817
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,120
was this whole sort of controversial 
thing that was going on up there,

818
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,631
but it was actually quite funny because 
he had this amazing party in this 

819
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:01,270
carwash right across the street isn't 
really great.

820
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,170
Yeah,
it was really cool.

821
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,830
What'd you guys,
what was it like the bar closed,

822
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:05,080
right.

823
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,770
And then it's like,
okay,

824
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:07,810
well the bar at the hotel closed and 
then everyone said,

825
00:38:07,811 --> 00:38:08,200
well,
you know,

826
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:13,201
ducks stand hopes.
Having a party in a carwash across the 

827
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:17,041
street,
what you walk out across the street and 

828
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:17,041
now it's,
you know,

829
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:17,041
three in the morning now.
Right.

830
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:20,851
So those bars are closed when you walk 
crust literally right across the street 

831
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:20,920
from the hotel,
the main hotel for the festival.

832
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,660
There's this like the smallest carwash,
you know,

833
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:28,920
it's got the garage hoses everywhere and
it was just,

834
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:33,921
just buckets of beer and we were there 
to like seven in the morning or 

835
00:38:33,921 --> 00:38:34,400
something like that.
So good time.

836
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,460
Lots people,
a couple of hundred people in there,

837
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:37,980
in this car wash.
Awesome.

838
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,000
So you just put together a party.
Yeah,

839
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:40,930
it was really,
it was really good.

840
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:46,290
But just a move.
But what happens if people drive drunk 

841
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:46,290
and stuff?

842
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,100
I don't think any of them driving taxis 
and stuff.

843
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,720
Really.
That's,

844
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,430
that's a nice move.
Good.

845
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:52,990
You know,
the thing that's cool about it is like,

846
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:54,250
you know,
so we go over there.

847
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:57,780
I'm at the Montreal Comedy Festival and 
I met bill burn.

848
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:02,790
He came and saw my show and then last 
night I thought I'd let you know I'm 

849
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:06,181
going to go see bill show.
Go see bill show you pop out on stage 

850
00:39:06,181 --> 00:39:07,780
unexpectedly.
Next thing you know,

851
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,540
I'm up here at your house.
We're drinking cups of coffee,

852
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,090
delicious coffee and uh,
doing some,

853
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:15,370
uh,
some Webo vision here.

854
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,640
It's pretty cool.
It is cool.

855
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:21,910
It's totally twitter.
A couple of times I've said,

856
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:22,460
hey,
you know,

857
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,950
joe,
check this out.

858
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:28,951
I'm on the road.
I sent you a couple of my trailers for 

859
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:28,951
my standard.
We see them on Tom Green.com.

860
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:33,901
Go and Tom Green.com.
Have a look at some of the trailers of 

861
00:39:33,901 --> 00:39:34,240
the tour and around doing this,
but for the folks on Itunes,

862
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,500
it's Tom Green live.

863
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,130
If you,
uh,

864
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:41,170
if you want to find them on twitter,
go at Tom Green live because they can't 

865
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,580
see this where it's absolutely Tom 
Green.

866
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:44,530
Live as my twitter.
Still releasing that movie,

867
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:49,620
that movie a young Pranksters Prank star
yet that we're working on that one 

868
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:50,340
still.
Whoa.

869
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,840
I can't wait for Susan.
It's kind of,

870
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:54,640
um,
it's kind of,

871
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,350
it's kind of a top secret.
It's not finished.

872
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,380
Well,
I can't really tell you what's about 

873
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,551
because I'm not sure I even know yet 
because we're still kind of in the 

874
00:40:05,551 --> 00:40:05,551
process of finishing it.
Cool.

875
00:40:05,551 --> 00:40:05,920
Cool.
Yeah.

876
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:07,360
I want you to do more movies,
man.

877
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:08,860
I really enjoyed.
Freddy got fingered.

878
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,980
Oh yeah,
yeah,

879
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,320
yeah,
yeah.

880
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,130
Thank you.
You went out there with that man.

881
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,600
You took a crazy chance.
Yeah,

882
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:18,601
I think it shocked a lot of people.
They didn't know what to do with it 

883
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:18,601
know,
because it was so out there,

884
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:20,740
but it was one of the ultimate stoner 
movies.

885
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,280
If you're a stoner,
what?

886
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,540
Go get Freddy of people like,
you know,

887
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,490
a lot of people haven't,
haven't really heard enough good reviews

888
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:32,491
of it.
It's really fucking funny girl that all 

889
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:35,380
day with the baby when the giving birth,
I want to say anymore.

890
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:37,930
I don't want to ruin it in a way to your
comedy,

891
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,500
but now.
Well let me just,

892
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,400
let me tell you the thing that.
Thank you for saying that,

893
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:43,880
because you know,
when you,

894
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,540
when you,
you get thrust into this situation where

895
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:49,870
all of a sudden I had an opportunity to 
make a movie to write.

896
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:54,871
I wrote it obviously was trying to make 
the stupidest movie we could think of 

897
00:40:54,871 --> 00:40:56,260
right now.
Let's make it the stupidest thing ever.

898
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,080
And then,
you know,

899
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,390
the studio at the time had all this 
opportunity to make this.

900
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:01,960
They said,
okay,

901
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:04,020
they had all these directors I said I 
want to direct it to.

902
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:09,090
So then they let me direct it.
So now I'm swinging blooding babies 

903
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:12,691
around and you know,
jacking off elephants and stuff and you 

904
00:41:12,691 --> 00:41:15,841
know,
getting inside deer carcasses and doing 

905
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:15,841
all this stuff.
Right?

906
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:15,841
And then,
you know,

907
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:16,630
you're working on this thing for like a 
year,

908
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,620
right?
You know,

909
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,200
you're working on this thing for a year 
nonstop.

910
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,450
Uh,
you know,

911
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:24,460
you're casting it,
you're picking all the props,

912
00:41:24,461 --> 00:41:29,461
you're making sure all the way the,
the guts that come out of that deer 

913
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:30,880
carcass looked like rubber to me.
And then the prop guys like,

914
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:35,881
well,
we're going to put some blood on it and 

915
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:35,881
it's gonna go,
well,

916
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:39,281
let's see what that looks like.
And they do it and you look at it and 

917
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:39,281
you're like,
no,

918
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:39,740
it still looks like some rubber.
We got to get some real guts.

919
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:40,160
And they're like,
well,

920
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:45,161
we don't know how we're going to make 
real guts come out of the carcass when 

921
00:41:45,161 --> 00:41:45,161
you cut it.

922
00:41:45,161 --> 00:41:46,490
And then they go off and these are like 
people that are professionals,

923
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:51,491
you know,
and they go off and they come back the 

924
00:41:51,491 --> 00:41:51,491
next day and they go,
okay,

925
00:41:51,491 --> 00:41:54,280
we've rigged up this compressed air that
we're going to put in the back of the 

926
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,890
taxidermy deer.
You're going to run your knife down.

927
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:58,430
The slit is going to shoot out real pig 
guts that we've got the butcher shop,

928
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,310
you know,
and I'm draped in pig guts and I'm doing

929
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:03,410
all this stuff right?
And you're thinking,

930
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:04,310
okay,
this is crazy,

931
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:06,560
this is going to look crazy.
Then the movie comes out,

932
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,000
everybody like,
you know,

933
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,470
basically,
you know,

934
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,050
reams you like,
uh,

935
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,060
you know,
you've never been seen before in your 

936
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,060
life at this point,
you know what I mean?

937
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:19,510
Local papers and people and you and you 
feel completely kind of confused about 

938
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:19,510
it,
right?

939
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,980
Because you're thinking,
shit,

940
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:23,300
I thought it was pretty fucking funny.

941
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,700
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Right.

942
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,410
So then,
but the fun thing about it is after that

943
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:32,190
initial weekend and the whole sort of 
everybody talking about your movie being

944
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:36,500
crazy and disgusting and all this stuff,
you uh,

945
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:41,501
you know,
I've been on tour this year doing stand 

946
00:42:41,501 --> 00:42:42,500
up and it's been so much fun because 
there's a lot of a nut jobs out there in

947
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:44,640
the world that like,
that let that love the movie and they're

948
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,760
part of my show now.
And when I do my standup,

949
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,000
I do a little guitar at my show in the 
middle and I seen a couple like,

950
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,320
Daddy,
would you like some sausage?

951
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:53,480
I sing that with everybody sings it with
me.

952
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,670
And then people start shouting out some 
of their favorite bits.

953
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,280
But I'm surprised it went all across 
Australia,

954
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,880
Canada.
Next month I'm going to be in a Toronto 

955
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,290
Bellville,
um,

956
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,470
a Hamilton and London,
Ontario,

957
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,360
and uh,
people come to the shows and uh,

958
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:10,820
you know,
are,

959
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,580
are shouting out all these things from 
Freddie.

960
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,970
Got It.
Feels a lot.

961
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,180
I guess what I'm saying is,
thanks for bringing it up.

962
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:21,250
This is what I used to be out and 
actually getting all this positive 

963
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,551
feedback about the movie because I was 
made to feel like you're a victim of a 

964
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,880
pre-internet review system.
It was a bunch of fogy old douche bags 

965
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,660
and you know,
the way people looked at things was,

966
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,240
you know,
you couldn't just be when,

967
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:36,560
what year was pretty good fingered.
It was 2001,

968
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:41,580
you know,
what the fuck was on the Internet back 

969
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:41,580
then?
You know what I'm saying?

970
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:41,580
It wasn't the same as 2010 and the thing
doesn't attend.

971
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,480
You get your reviews from ain't it cool 
news.com.

972
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:49,810
That kind of shit.
Like I always go to Fandango or 

973
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:49,810
something.
I get my reviews online.

974
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,640
I want to use this moment as a,
as a real opportunity for me to actually

975
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:53,780
talk about this for a second.

976
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,970
Okay.
I directed this movie.

977
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,540
I wrote this whole thing and everybody 
freaks out on it.

978
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:00,530
It's Pre-internet,
right?

979
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,710
I the other day I went and I looked at a
netflix.

980
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,690
Okay.
At the end of the reviews of the movies.

981
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:10,691
Right.
So I did this just two days ago and I 

982
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:12,581
looked at the reviews and Freddy got 
fingered and the point of making that 

983
00:44:12,581 --> 00:44:13,010
movie was to kind of be polarizing,
right?

984
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:18,100
It was supposed to be ridiculous.
It was done in a way where I think that 

985
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,911
50 percent of the people who watch it 
are definitely going to hate it more 

986
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:22,790
than anything they've ever seen in their
entire life.

987
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,760
And that was the goal to,
you know,

988
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:27,560
in the job is obviously that the other 
50 percent of the people are laughing at

989
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:28,850
the 50 percent of the people that hate 
it.

990
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:30,200
And that's the joke,
right?

991
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,400
So yeah,
I went on Netflix and you're reading the

992
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:37,401
reviews and it's,
it's pretty much 50 slash 50 people are 

993
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:38,640
giving it either you know,
a good review or the worst review you've

994
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:40,590
ever read in your life back and forth,
back and forth,

995
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,920
and these people are just arguing with 
each other about it.

996
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:48,120
And here we are 10 years later after I 
made this thing and looking at these 

997
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,951
people,
having these passionate arguments 

998
00:44:51,951 --> 00:44:51,951
completely on opposite ends of the 
spectrum.

999
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:57,380
That's pretty funny.
So I like to go read the reviews on 

1000
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,900
this.
I really truly believed that at that 

1001
00:44:59,900 --> 00:44:59,970
movie came out today.
It would be an internet phenomenon.

1002
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:03,240
People will be so into it.
I think it was a fucking fun,

1003
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:04,890
crazy movie.
Red You will.

1004
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:09,891
I'm hoping to make another movie this 
year since since he has asked about the 

1005
00:45:09,891 --> 00:45:13,851
movies.
I'm hoping to make another movie this 

1006
00:45:13,851 --> 00:45:14,070
year,
which is going to be called insane prank

1007
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:17,970
movie and it's going to be just a bunch 
of crazy pranks street stuff,

1008
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,640
but you know,
it's going to be sort of a.

1009
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,900
well don't get beat up man.
I've been hearing you.

1010
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,430
You're telling me you're getting in 
fights,

1011
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:24,480
what's going on?
Oh yes,

1012
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,070
that's right.
Yeah,

1013
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,570
I am.
I've been in two fights.

1014
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,430
You're grown,
man.

1015
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:34,800
I won't be around and not get in.
I was defending myself both times.

1016
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:38,760
What happened?
I was attacked both times by who?

1017
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,690
I was by strangers both times.
For what reason?

1018
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,900
Well,
the first time I was attacked.

1019
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:47,340
Where was it?
Where does taking place?

1020
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:52,370
About two years ago in New York City.
And did the guy know you were Tom Green?

1021
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,580
The he was.
He was somebody who knew somebody.

1022
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,160
I don't know.
I don't know.

1023
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:04,161
He was somebody who was an acquaintance 
of somebody who I knew and now I'm now 

1024
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:09,891
I'm starting to get worried about 
getting into the details because what 

1025
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:09,990
really happened was quite intense.
Quite intense.

1026
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,180
Why I'm worried about getting it.

1027
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:11,850
Well,
because you know,

1028
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:13,260
I don't know.
I just thinking now all of a sudden I've

1029
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:15,680
never really talked about this on the 
radio in.

1030
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,830
That'd be kind of weird.
What's weird when you get in a fight,

1031
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,470
beat somebody up.
Tom Green?

1032
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:20,340
No,
he.

1033
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:22,980
He was punched in the head and I 
retaliated.

1034
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,200
Right.
And then whoop that ass,

1035
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:30,340
you know.
Did you get all up in their beat that 

1036
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:30,340
ass essentially?
Yes.

1037
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:30,340
Essentially.
Yes.

1038
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,430
Yes.
I was not heard.

1039
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,150
Probably shouldn't give out the details 
because you know,

1040
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,900
I just don't get sued.
You're Tom Green.

1041
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:37,890
Well,
you know,

1042
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,930
somebody punched me in the head and so I
had to kind of thing.

1043
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,080
But then the other solid jaw take a good
shot right there.

1044
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:47,730
Right there.
I had a bump the next day.

1045
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,950
It was,
it was itching gray out or did you stand

1046
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:52,650
your ground?
I was actually sitting down.

1047
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,420
He punched you when you were sitting 
down.

1048
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:00,260
What did you do?
Were you getting blown by his 

1049
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:00,260
girlfriend?
Why while you sitting?

1050
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,470
I was sitting beside his girlfriend.
You were?

1051
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,970
Yeah.
Or a girl that he knew,

1052
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,430
but I wasn't really,
uh,

1053
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:07,830
you know,
I was also with a girl who was my friend

1054
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:12,831
who was sitting beside me on this side 
and we were all friends and she was 

1055
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:13,200
friends with them.
But anyways,

1056
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,340
this is the point.
Let's,

1057
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,910
let's move past that.
The point is,

1058
00:47:15,911 --> 00:47:17,610
as you got in fights,
I got in a fight,

1059
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,710
so then the second time around,
okay,

1060
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,350
you're a veteran by now.
You're ready to end.

1061
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,750
This is actually something I can ask you
about for advice on this because this is

1062
00:47:24,751 --> 00:47:26,730
about controlling your temper,
right?

1063
00:47:26,731 --> 00:47:29,670
This is about when somebody comes at you
and you know you're.

1064
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,810
You are a fighter,
so you know about this stuff,

1065
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:33,820
right?
I don't know about this stuff,

1066
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:39,250
but what happened I,
I go go into this sort of post traumatic

1067
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:42,460
stress disorder,
kind of everything goes in slow motion.

1068
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:43,560
Well,
you know,

1069
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,480
that's one of the best things about 
learning martial arts is that you become

1070
00:47:47,481 --> 00:47:49,670
confident in your ability to defend 
yourself,

1071
00:47:49,671 --> 00:47:51,830
not you might not always be able to 
defend yourself.

1072
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,550
You might.
There might be guns and weapons and all,

1073
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:57,020
but you're not going to feel completely 
helpless.

1074
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,580
You're going to feel like you have at 
least confidence.

1075
00:47:58,581 --> 00:48:00,110
If you have a chance,
you can do something.

1076
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,930
Whereas a person who doesn't know how to
fight it all and has no experience,

1077
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:07,130
it's such a paralyzing feeling when you 
in the presence of violence.

1078
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,290
So I mean,
you just want to cover up in a ball,

1079
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,730
you just want to try to protect 
yourself.

1080
00:48:10,731 --> 00:48:14,050
You don't know what to do.
So this first occasion had bad feelings.

1081
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:14,930
First occasion happened

1082
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:19,930
and cut to three months.
Maybe six months later I'm walking down 

1083
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,400
sunset outside Mel's diner that's got 
the stitches taken out.

1084
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,370
Yeah.
And Somehow,

1085
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:25,980
um,

1086
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,440
for some reason somebody comes up behind
me,

1087
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:35,441
I was,
I think I'd actually had a few drinks 

1088
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:37,811
that night.
Me and my friends were being somewhat 

1089
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:37,811
obnoxious.
Oh,

1090
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:39,680
talking loudly,
being generally idiots on the street.

1091
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:40,790
Yeah.
And some,

1092
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:45,440
some guy saw me being kind of an idiot 
and came walking up to me and my friend,

1093
00:48:45,441 --> 00:48:47,390
that was Brian and he said,
hey man,

1094
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,640
I want to kick your ass right now.
Just like that.

1095
00:48:49,641 --> 00:48:50,630
No reason.
Okay.

1096
00:48:50,631 --> 00:48:52,940
He said,
I'm going to kick your ass right now.

1097
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:57,110
And this guy was actually smaller than 
me,

1098
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,490
which I thought was strange in these 
coming out of nowhere.

1099
00:48:59,491 --> 00:49:03,680
And the word of the dark and there's no 
one around right by Poquito mas outside.

1100
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,740
Mel Mel's diner on sunset.
I look at him,

1101
00:49:06,741 --> 00:49:07,730
my friend looks at him,
he,

1102
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:10,220
my friend says,
are you serious dude?

1103
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,480
And he goes,
yeah.

1104
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:14,060
And then my friend for whatever reason 
goes okay.

1105
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,060
And goes like that.
So then this guy's running at me,

1106
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:22,330
but because of the previous situation,
I'm now in like the slow motion mode.

1107
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,260
Like he's coming at me and I've done,
well,

1108
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,670
this is not going to.
So I went at him and I,

1109
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,650
I just put my hands on his neck,
right?

1110
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:35,790
And I put my hand behind them.
I kind of lowered them down under the 

1111
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:36,410
ground and I put my fist up in his face 
like this.

1112
00:49:36,411 --> 00:49:37,880
And I said,
I don't want to hurt you man.

1113
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,370
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt you.

1114
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,160
Right.
And he said his leg was kind of flapping

1115
00:49:43,161 --> 00:49:48,161
up on the side of my body like this.
And I had him pinned on his back on the 

1116
00:49:48,161 --> 00:49:48,161
sidewalk.
And he said,

1117
00:49:48,161 --> 00:49:48,530
okay man.
Okay.

1118
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,750
And I got up and he walked away.
Wow,

1119
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:57,910
so then how for rape joke to the mount 
position for those that you don't know 

1120
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:58,880
what Tom Green was doing,
grabbing the hand and the bitch,

1121
00:49:58,881 --> 00:50:01,370
where's my money grip?
And then he had a fist up.

1122
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:03,330
Yeah.
And it just kind of ended.

1123
00:50:03,331 --> 00:50:07,890
It diffused the situation.
Nobody got hurt and uh,

1124
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:12,080
you know,
that's,

1125
00:50:12,081 --> 00:50:17,081
I think that's,
I think that's something that people 

1126
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:17,081
need to know is that to,
you know,

1127
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:19,310
there is this flash of a moment when 
somebody attacks you were,

1128
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:20,870
you kind of go into this animal mode,
right?

1129
00:50:20,871 --> 00:50:22,820
And you're not in complete control.
Right.

1130
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And then you know,
you gotta you gotta kind of be able to 

1131
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,120
control that now.
Are you like paranoid

1132
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,510
that everyone's going to attack you?
Like,

1133
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:32,930
do you like the,
although less paranoid now because I now

1134
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:34,520
know I got a,
got a,

1135
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:39,610
got that sort of.
It's sort of like a throat on the 

1136
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:40,270
ground.
You're always thinking about it.

1137
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,310
Right?
Well the other thing is,

1138
00:50:42,311 --> 00:50:47,311
is that that only worked because he was 
coming at me fast and he was sort of 

1139
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:47,720
smaller than me.
I don't think that would've worked if he

1140
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:49,940
was bigger than me.
That would have worked on new.

1141
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:52,250
Anything new,
anything that would work.

1142
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,440
You find a lot.
He was probably really,

1143
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:59,441
really drunk and it was just.
To me it was exciting though because I 

1144
00:50:59,441 --> 00:51:00,350
haven't been in any sort of physical 
altercation since I was at a kid.

1145
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:03,990
You don't want that kind of excitement.
If you want to go to Jujitsu class,

1146
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,600
Jujitsu,
you get to spar,

1147
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:10,601
you get to go full blast with each other
and trying to kill each other with your 

1148
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:10,601
bare hands.

1149
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:13,420
It's awesome.
You get all that shit out and you don't 

1150
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,341
have to get in fights on there.
On your conflict is there's a certain 

1151
00:51:15,771 --> 00:51:18,500
amount over a certain amount of 
excitement,

1152
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:21,470
primal excitement that comes from.
But it's very dangerous man.

1153
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,170
Oh my gosh.
I actually,

1154
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:27,180
when you're an alcohol,
you guys were walking down the street 

1155
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:27,180
making a fuck load of noise.
No,

1156
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,821
this has become so paranoid about it.
Since then that I've actually kind of 

1157
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:35,500
essentially really laid off the sauce a 
bit because I realized that,

1158
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,390
you know,
although I didn't really kind of.

1159
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,770
I got attacked,
right,

1160
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:43,430
but it was due to my own sort of loud,
obnoxious behavior.

1161
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:45,320
That's what I'm saying.
Like you learn from that,

1162
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:45,890
right?
Yeah.

1163
00:51:45,891 --> 00:51:46,610
You do.
You do.

1164
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:51,611
And drunkenness and things you can do if
you're really loud and in public.

1165
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:54,410
That's a douchey.
It's when you're in your twenties,

1166
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,800
being drunk out at the bar and being 
crazy.

1167
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:58,460
Yeah.
It's part,

1168
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:04,040
it's part of it.
I just turned 39 years old and I'm 

1169
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:04,310
thinking to myself,
that's not cute anymore.

1170
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:05,000
Really.
Totally.

1171
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:10,001
It's not cute.
It's not cute when it annoys other 

1172
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:10,001
people.
That's what it is,

1173
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,821
you know,
and I never used to think about that 

1174
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:12,821
when I was younger.
I just think about it.

1175
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:12,890
I just random fun it.
Woo.

1176
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,440
Yeah.
We're having fun.

1177
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,460
Who gives a shit and then as you get 
older you start going,

1178
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:21,461
wait a minute.
But if we're having fun at other 

1179
00:52:21,461 --> 00:52:21,461
people's expense,
they shouldn't be fun.

1180
00:52:21,461 --> 00:52:21,830
Should be annoying to me too.
I should be embarrassed.

1181
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:24,710
You know,
they learn not to be a Douche bag.

1182
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,580
Yeah,
exactly.

1183
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,030
And that's exactly what moved that 
you're ready to go.

1184
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,910
I think you might want to.
I'm going to show you,

1185
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:36,911
we'll go onto my cage in the garage and 
I'll show you some counters to be very 

1186
00:52:36,911 --> 00:52:36,911
careful.

1187
00:52:36,911 --> 00:52:36,950
I,
I would.

1188
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:41,480
I would appreciate some self defense.
Not that I want to extend your arm.

1189
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:43,040
You've got to make sure you do it 
correctly.

1190
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,110
I'd like to take some.
Some Jujitsu.

1191
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:50,700
Crop was fun too.
It's like a combination of things and 

1192
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:50,700
they,
they,

1193
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,440
they give you like a lot of stuff like 
this is what you do on the street when a

1194
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:56,441
guy comes after you,
but you can't prepare for everything on 

1195
00:52:56,441 --> 00:52:56,441
the street.
You don't really know what the fuck.

1196
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,050
If a guy's going to have a gun or a 
knife,

1197
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,250
you're not going to really know.
You know?

1198
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:03,710
You're better off just getting really 
good at any sort of a martial art.

1199
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:06,890
Like you know you're really going to get
good at knife defense.

1200
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,260
That's.
Yeah.

1201
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:13,010
That seems like a waste of time 
considering no one's ever pulled a knife

1202
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:14,840
on you and your life away from 
douchebags.

1203
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:17,390
Keep your life clean.
Let's hope we don't get stabbed.

1204
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,410
Yeah.
Don't,

1205
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,990
don't be going out.
Practice every day because one day God's

1206
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:25,991
going to have a knife.
There's this fat guy has his website on 

1207
00:53:25,991 --> 00:53:26,070
all sorts of attacks,

1208
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,090
like a knife against a knife,
how he will block this knife and then he

1209
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:33,510
will attack this means up fat.
Fuck Guy's hilarious.

1210
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:35,020
He's completely out of shape and he's 
like,

1211
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,590
he's actually kind of a half decent 
writer,

1212
00:53:37,591 --> 00:53:40,590
but totally completely delusional 
martial arts guy.

1213
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:41,650
And so,
uh,

1214
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:46,670
he's got these instructional videos 
where a guy will come at him with a 

1215
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,660
knife and he will block this knife and 
cut to the guy's body,

1216
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:54,110
go behind him,
and he cuts like major organs and I'm 

1217
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:57,051
looking to make.
This is the most ridiculous thing I've 

1218
00:53:57,051 --> 00:53:59,001
ever seen in my life.
Preparing for a knife fight that will 

1219
00:53:59,001 --> 00:53:59,790
never have one probably cause of the 
preparing for it to take your clothes.

1220
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:03,690
Increasing his odds of being killed by 
like $10,000

1221
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,280
times carrying knives on them 
everywhere.

1222
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,650
Challenged asking for a knife,
fight.

1223
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,290
He's begging for a knife.
Fight is nuts.

1224
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,780
You know what the fuck's wasting their 
life?

1225
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:15,180
Preparing for the knife fights.
This is funny.

1226
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:20,181
Sometimes I look down here at this 
stream and then I see you and I'm 

1227
00:54:20,181 --> 00:54:20,670
thinking that I'm looking at you live,
but it's deliberately.

1228
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:25,850
Yeah,
let's not look at it because I don't 

1229
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:25,850
want to confuse you.
It was funny.

1230
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:25,850
It was.
It was confusing to me because.

1231
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,390
And they'll go off and adrift.
Yeah.

1232
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,030
Was,
it was.

1233
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:28,380
Yeah,
it was,

1234
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:30,140
it was like I was,
I was looking at your,

1235
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,680
you're laughing over there and I'm like,
wait a minute.

1236
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,990
I'm not saying anything funny right now.
Oh wait,

1237
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:34,890
he's not laughing.
That was,

1238
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:40,260
that was a few seconds ago.
Something that was very high tech run a 

1239
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:40,680
delay in case you start getting crazy.
Curse our government.

1240
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,880
Yeah,
this is cool.

1241
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:42,810
And now,
so we're,

1242
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,990
uh,
we're broadcasting on itunes,

1243
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,700
itunes,
on the Zune marketplace.

1244
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,760
It's on all sorts of different things.
Oh,

1245
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:51,990
this is cool.
This is cool.

1246
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,610
I'm now.
So yeah.

1247
00:54:53,611 --> 00:54:54,310
So,
um,

1248
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:58,980
stitcher number one in Canada,
a comedy few times on itunes.

1249
00:54:59,130 --> 00:54:59,950
Okay.
Yeah.

1250
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:02,250
See,
this is something that Canada,

1251
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:07,430
I'm going to start trying to do a 
podcast myself for the first time and I 

1252
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,000
in starting next week.
So it's going to be fun.

1253
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:14,570
You've always been in that kind of 
community access channel like are you 

1254
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,810
will always make them via.
You actually changed everything when you

1255
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:17,640
had your show on MTV,
in my opinion,

1256
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,080
my whole age group,
uh,

1257
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,200
I'm 36,
but you took my idea making stupid 

1258
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,450
little videos and going,
wow,

1259
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:29,451
look what he's doing.
He's actually doing it for real z's on 

1260
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:29,451
MTV.
You know,

1261
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,150
you've really changed that whole market.
You,

1262
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:35,270
it's pretty,
pretty amazing career that you've had 

1263
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:35,270
men.
That was an exciting time.

1264
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:36,420
It was obviously that was most exciting 
was just blown.

1265
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,900
Brian,
you know,

1266
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:43,020
maybe we wait until the show's over and 
as one of the most awkward things,

1267
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:45,100
every driveway or something like that.
Really.

1268
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:50,220
Like when Doug's down opens here,
I was trying to sell it really good 

1269
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:50,220
things about them,
but I'm like,

1270
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,541
it's so weird saying that he's right 
here and it's going to broadcasting in 

1271
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:53,541
front of the world.
But a great show though.

1272
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,890
You come up to Joe's house,
coffee,

1273
00:55:55,891 --> 00:55:58,640
you get a blow job.
I think a lot of people though I think a

1274
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:03,650
lot you've inspired a lot of people are 
inspired me to do this man this online.

1275
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:06,540
When I came over to your house,
I'm like,

1276
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:07,320
wow,
oh yeah,

1277
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,490
I remember how excited you are about it 
and you talk to the,

1278
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:15,550
the.
There was a document or was an 

1279
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:19,460
entertainment tonight,
Canada or somebody who was at the house 

1280
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:19,460
and you said you were very excited about
and I thought,

1281
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:23,751
well this is cool.
This is maybe maybe this is not a waste 

1282
00:56:23,751 --> 00:56:23,970
of time doing the show in living room 
just so we,

1283
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,120
it,
we knew that eventually it was going to 

1284
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:29,120
get to the point where the Internet and 
the television combined.

1285
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,730
It hasn't totally happened yet.
Convert pretty close concert.

1286
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,960
Too small a dribble,
you know,

1287
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:39,961
I can get like I have a DVD player that 
lets you go to let you go to different 

1288
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,660
sources and get netflix and.
Yeah.

1289
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:47,380
And even youtube allows you go to 
youtube as well and you stream.

1290
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,580
I don't know about ustream.
No,

1291
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,020
no,
I think I was wrong.

1292
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,870
That was youtube here,
but it's just,

1293
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,830
it's close.
You know,

1294
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:57,010
you can get the Internet is bringing 
content to your television.

1295
00:56:57,011 --> 00:57:02,011
It's just doing it through outside 
parties now is not quite as accessible 

1296
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:02,011
as I would.

1297
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:06,670
Thank you.
I worry that it's going to get all 

1298
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:06,670
controlled.
So you end up,

1299
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:11,171
everyone gets some box.
They're watching the internet on their 

1300
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:11,171
TV,
but it's not the real internet,

1301
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:16,031
you know,
it's just the stuff that the shows that 

1302
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,580
get bought by Time Warner cable until 
they decide to put on the Internet,

1303
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:19,190
which then all of a sudden you don't 
have the Internet.

1304
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:24,220
You have this sort of other way of 
distributing and television that's on 

1305
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:24,430
demand.
So we're,

1306
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,600
it's not free net neutrality,
you know,

1307
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,050
you need,
need to make sure that,

1308
00:57:30,051 --> 00:57:31,640
you know,
and I don't know a whole lot about it,

1309
00:57:31,641 --> 00:57:36,641
but you know,
I was talking about this the other day 

1310
00:57:36,641 --> 00:57:36,641
with my friend and he said net 
neutrality is a big issue right now.

1311
00:57:36,641 --> 00:57:37,490
You know,
they're talking about,

1312
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,630
well,
since you're in Hollywood,

1313
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,420
since we don't know a lot about it,
argue about it.

1314
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:47,100
It's one of us know the points.
So I just think that we got to stop this

1315
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:49,230
man.
That's how we rock it in Hollywood.

1316
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:51,280
Argue about shit we don't even know 
about.

1317
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,010
Well,
you know,

1318
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:56,460
I was on stage at some guy,
some guy in the audience just decided he

1319
00:57:56,461 --> 00:57:58,080
was going to heckle and this is what he 
had called.

1320
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:03,290
He goes,
even Stephen Hawking said that the 

1321
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:06,060
universe proves there must be a god.
Like he was arguing with me,

1322
00:58:06,061 --> 00:58:07,880
angry at me and this is what he was 
saying.

1323
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,500
And then Stephen Hawkins came out last 
week talking,

1324
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,680
said and came out two weeks ago and said
something like,

1325
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,750
dude,
you didn't even read it.

1326
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,310
He didn't even read it.
And you're arguing,

1327
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:22,410
you're yelling it out publicly and Stan 
and that's La.

1328
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,930
That's my point.
That was Los Angeles.

1329
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,880
Think about anything.
Just argue it.

1330
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:33,020
Not only did he argue it,
he yelled it out and I don't even know 

1331
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:36,111
what I was talking about.
I forgot because it was so ridiculous 

1332
00:58:36,111 --> 00:58:38,751
what he said,
but he yelled it out like from the side 

1333
00:58:38,751 --> 00:58:41,151
of the stage,
like it was like an important point for 

1334
00:58:41,151 --> 00:58:43,101
him.
Did you have a conversation with them 

1335
00:58:43,101 --> 00:58:43,101
about it?
Very little.

1336
00:58:43,101 --> 00:58:43,101
I talked to him a little bit from the 
stage.

1337
00:58:43,101 --> 00:58:45,420
I tried to be nice and just segwayed 
into the rest of the show,

1338
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:47,250
but he just like wanted to.
It was a weird thing.

1339
00:58:47,251 --> 00:58:52,251
It was like he was a guy that just 
wanted to argue like it wasn't a game 

1340
00:58:52,251 --> 00:58:52,740
like he wanted to play catch with me.
Have you noticed a lot more heckling joe

1341
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:54,080
lately?
No.

1342
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:55,230
No,
not lately.

1343
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:58,950
It's comes and goes as cool crowds and 
not so cool crowds and it's always.

1344
00:58:58,951 --> 00:59:01,650
The crowds were always cool.
There's just always a few douchebags,

1345
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:05,250
a tiny few amount of Douche bags,
but that's all you need.

1346
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,810
You know,
if you have 300 people in a,

1347
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:11,930
in a comedy club,
all you need is three Douche bags and 

1348
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:14,301
you've got an issue.
You have to deal one douche bag and you 

1349
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,311
got an issue.
So some you like that or I would way 

1350
00:59:16,311 --> 00:59:20,200
rather have just a fun show.
Like in India it's stressful and started

1351
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,980
yelling.
I did two in Indianapolis

1352
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,980
last Friday.
Never been to Indianapolis for comedy 

1353
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:26,980
before.
It was fucking great,

1354
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,530
man.
The crowds were super cool.

1355
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:30,230
Dude.
Everybody's super friendly and fun.

1356
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:33,830
It's a nice like easy going place and 
it's a decent sized city.

1357
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:34,970
It's a million,
4 million,

1358
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:35,810
400,000
people.

1359
00:59:35,811 --> 00:59:40,811
So it's a,
it's not a small town and just really 

1360
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:40,811
fucking cool,
friendly people,

1361
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,350
you know,
I like that man.

1362
00:59:42,351 --> 00:59:45,890
I don't want to deal with some fucking 
Douche bags and need attention.

1363
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,240
That's annoying man.
It's like I want to tell you man,

1364
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:52,050
I want to pull them aside and you know,
take them away from everybody and go,

1365
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,870
dude,
get your shit together man.

1366
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,840
You see what you're doing.
You're out of control.

1367
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:00,860
You just,
you're so needy for attention that 

1368
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:00,860
you're blended.
Disrupt everything around you.

1369
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,920
I've started to notice them before they 
even say anything and we often sit right

1370
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:04,680
at the front,
right?

1371
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,190
Of course,
sit right there where everyone could see

1372
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:09,680
them and they're sort of these,
you can tell that these sort of,

1373
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:14,950
you know,
Alpha personality types who just want 

1374
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:14,950
everybody to look at them.
I mean,

1375
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:15,100
come on,
what,

1376
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,340
what their problem.
No,

1377
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:16,960
no,
but I mean,

1378
01:00:16,961 --> 01:00:19,760
you know,
the weirdest thing when people talk back

1379
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:20,280
to,
you know,

1380
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,560
if you want to do,
if you want to,

1381
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,490
why don't you just go do comedy,
you know,

1382
01:00:23,491 --> 01:00:24,670
and go do your own show,
you know?

1383
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:27,050
No,
they don't want to criticize.

1384
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:29,660
It's like critics.
These critics hated your fucking movie.

1385
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:31,910
Go make a better movie where they're not
going to make a better movie.

1386
01:00:31,911 --> 01:00:33,650
They have nothing to contribute.
They're contributing.

1387
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:39,010
They're doing their best to be verbose 
and their bitchiness that's what their 

1388
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,120
contribution is.
Be County about things.

1389
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:43,610
Always look for the negative,
love everything foreign.

1390
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,640
I mean that's really what it is,
but it's also even when the yellow fun 

1391
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:49,640
stuff,
it's sort of annoying too,

1392
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:49,640
right?

1393
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:54,550
Well,
they were saying was when think they're 

1394
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:54,550
trying to help you or something worse is
when they talk to you,

1395
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,020
you ever have people in the front row 
and they just talk at you,

1396
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,900
like why would you do that?
Like,

1397
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,140
what the fuck I'm going to get to it and
we get to the whole subject,

1398
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:04,570
you know,
don't,

1399
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,200
don't move me in a different direction.
Come on,

1400
01:01:06,201 --> 01:01:06,880
man.
What?

1401
01:01:06,881 --> 01:01:07,850
Well,
where were you going?

1402
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,410
Why are you talking to me?
Man,

1403
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:11,810
this isn't a conversation,
so fucking comedy show.

1404
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,750
I always give people the opportunity to 
yell shit out though.

1405
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:19,751
I do a q and a.
It almost end of almost every one of my 

1406
01:01:19,751 --> 01:01:20,150
shows just because it's fun.
Sometimes it's anticlimactic.

1407
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:25,390
It's dangerous because sometimes it 
drags on and I do the q and a for like 

1408
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,430
an hour or something.
I don't know how to end because it's so 

1409
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:32,081
open ended,
but I think people like fucking around 

1410
01:01:32,081 --> 01:01:32,630
and being able to talk to me so I let 
them know like,

1411
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:34,280
well there'll be a time where we can 
yell shit out,

1412
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:34,700
but it's not.

1413
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:39,700
Let me get my material.
I don't do all this and then we'll fuck 

1414
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:39,700
around.
Yeah,

1415
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:39,700
that's a good idea.
Yeah,

1416
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,140
because it's the best is when there's 
lines and microphones.

1417
01:01:42,141 --> 01:01:43,730
That's how I did it when I recorded my 
DVD.

1418
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,050
That's the best way to do it.
A lot.

1419
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:47,930
We have a line and people come up to the
line and they get to the microphone.

1420
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:48,710
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1421
01:01:48,711 --> 01:01:50,720
Because when they just yell shit out,
it just gets too crazy.

1422
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,520
Right,
right.

1423
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:53,430
Brian,
I was just going to say,

1424
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,770
let's see guys name,
like,

1425
01:01:54,771 --> 01:01:55,160
you know,
look,

1426
01:01:55,220 --> 01:02:00,220
talk about Jews to churches in the 
church.

1427
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,390
What should he have done different now?
Because you have stuff out on,

1428
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:12,770
headed on tv or you do people the Leo to
do bits that I can't remember.

1429
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:17,771
A lot of them though.
The problem is when I stopped doing a 

1430
01:02:17,771 --> 01:02:17,771
bit,
man,

1431
01:02:17,771 --> 01:02:18,080
I don't remember how to do it.
Like somebody yelled out,

1432
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:20,040
do the talking dog that the other day,

1433
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,200
the drug commercial bed.
And I was like fuck,

1434
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:25,290
how does that go?
Like I haven't done it in a long time so

1435
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:27,890
I had to try to perform it from memory.
You know,

1436
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,500
I just,
I,

1437
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:33,560
I always try to come up with new shit 
and when you have new shit you got to 

1438
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,351
abandon the old shit.
You can't keep remembering it every now 

1439
01:02:36,351 --> 01:02:36,351
and then what will pop up from like the 
old days?

1440
01:02:36,351 --> 01:02:37,590
I remember one like,
wow,

1441
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:42,591
I remember how this one goes,
but in order to keep writing new 

1442
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:45,501
material,
you know I've had right now I had the 

1443
01:02:45,501 --> 01:02:48,651
first one was I'm going to dead some day
and then there was the showtime special 

1444
01:02:48,651 --> 01:02:53,211
that I did or not,
and then there was belly of the beast 

1445
01:02:53,211 --> 01:02:53,211
and the showtime special in 2005 and 
then shiny,

1446
01:02:53,211 --> 01:02:55,560
happy Jihad and then talking Mikey's in 
space.

1447
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,990
That's a lot of different material.
I can't remember all that shit.

1448
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,920
Just pop in the DVD and watch.
Watch your show.

1449
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:07,060
Nobody's gonna get it back in your head 
for me to watch the stuff that I've just

1450
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:12,080
done recently,
it's really uncomfortable for me to 

1451
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:12,720
watch something like from like a few 
years ago while you fucking a fleshlight

1452
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:13,410
might help.
Wow.

1453
01:03:13,411 --> 01:03:15,570
What are you saying?
Yeah,

1454
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:16,680
well,
and it's like when you were playing that

1455
01:03:16,681 --> 01:03:19,280
song earlier,
I was sort of sitting there kind of sort

1456
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,350
of curling up inside my shoes,
you know,

1457
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:26,360
because it's like you're looking at 
something from 20 years ago and you're 

1458
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,570
gone.
I wouldn't really do it exactly that 

1459
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:28,570
way.
I know which way I'm patrolling,

1460
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:28,780
so look truck,
do you know,

1461
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:30,960
it's,
that's kind of cheesy,

1462
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:36,500
but it's capturing.
Somebody said this to me once that you 

1463
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,840
know,
you just have to think of all these 

1464
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:38,840
performances as capturing a moment in 
time,

1465
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:38,840
you know,
but I,

1466
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,360
I don't know.

1467
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,920
That's all well and good and I 
appreciate that,

1468
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:42,300
but I don't want to.
It's still me,

1469
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:47,440
you know,
I don't really want to watch me from 15 

1470
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:47,440
years ago do comedy.
It's not fun.

1471
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,660
I don't know like me for five years ago 
doing it,

1472
01:03:48,661 --> 01:03:50,550
you know,
it's hard watching yourself,

1473
01:03:50,551 --> 01:03:50,950
man,
when,

1474
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:53,130
when you're,
you're very critical and honest,

1475
01:03:53,131 --> 01:03:53,820
you know,
it's hard.

1476
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,400
It's hard.
Like in trying to figure out how much of

1477
01:03:56,401 --> 01:04:01,401
this should I be trying to enjoy this 
but trying to enjoy it like a spectator 

1478
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:02,970
or should I be hypercritical of 
everything I'm doing because that's what

1479
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:04,250
I always wind up doing.
Yeah.

1480
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,610
I'd prefer not watching myself,
but you have to go over material I think

1481
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,330
to um,
to uh,

1482
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,630
like you listen to bits and sometimes 
you go out,

1483
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,370
your brain will take you down different 
paths.

1484
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:14,940
Like go,
oh,

1485
01:04:14,941 --> 01:04:17,400
why didn't I say this or why didn't I 
talk about that?

1486
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:22,550
Or you remember like certain taglines 
that you may have adlibbed at the 

1487
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:25,701
moment,
which may be gone if you don't remember 

1488
01:04:25,701 --> 01:04:25,701
him.
There's a lot of my best taglines.

1489
01:04:25,701 --> 01:04:29,061
I forget them.
I just stopped doing it for some reason 

1490
01:04:29,061 --> 01:04:29,061
and then I forget it and then some.
So someone will say to you like,

1491
01:04:29,061 --> 01:04:29,730
why don't you say that anymore?
I'm like,

1492
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:30,960
Oh fuck,
I forgot.

1493
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:33,960
I know you have it all written down 
somewhere or most of it.

1494
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:36,270
Yeah.
Most of the material is written down.

1495
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:41,300
It's all written by the way I start off,
almost all of my bits is I start them 

1496
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:45,291
off with like blog entries.
Whether or not it gets posted on the 

1497
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:45,480
Internet at all.
Almost all of it is just me dissecting a

1498
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:50,481
subject.
This is the method that I've come to 

1499
01:04:50,481 --> 01:04:52,731
over the last few years is the most.
To me it's the best method because it 

1500
01:04:52,731 --> 01:04:56,571
allows me to really examine all the 
different ways I think about a subject 

1501
01:04:56,571 --> 01:04:57,480
without worrying about people's 
attention spans.

1502
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,560
Right.
Just right.

1503
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:03,610
You know,
and it could be page after page after 

1504
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:05,481
page,
just ramblings on what I think about 

1505
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:05,481
anything and then I dissect what's funny
about it,

1506
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:06,570
like this is funny,
this is funny,

1507
01:05:06,571 --> 01:05:07,470
this is funny.
And then I say,

1508
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:09,870
well how much this would go into a bit,
could this be a bit,

1509
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,950
okay,
this could be a bat right here.

1510
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:12,360
This,
this is how I'd have to say it.

1511
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:14,760
And then I looked at it like that.
Like I'm stealing from myself,

1512
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:17,620
I'm stealing,
get back to the Internet,

1513
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,060
right?
People

1514
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,160
if I post it,
but there's a lot

1515
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,660
stuff that I read that I don't post,
stuff that I write,

1516
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:27,661
I write it as if it was going to be a 
blog entry and then just winds up going 

1517
01:05:27,661 --> 01:05:30,511
into file because I don't like where I 
was going with it or it wasn't finished 

1518
01:05:30,511 --> 01:05:34,171
with it.
But I do like this part and that part 

1519
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:34,171
will become a bit.
Do you like,

1520
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:38,101
do you think of your ideas when you sit 
down to write or is it when you're out 

1521
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:38,290
in a boat with friends hanging out and 
then you bolt?

1522
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:39,870
It's everything.
I think you know,

1523
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:44,880
you get different kinds of creativity 
just from driving in your car with the 

1524
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:44,880
music off.
You know,

1525
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,790
if you have your stereo off and you'd 
just drive your car and don't talk to 

1526
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:48,790
anybody,
just doing that,

1527
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:49,570
doing like every average everyday 
things,

1528
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:54,960
a percentage of your brain,
you know you're going to focus on what 

1529
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:54,970
you're doing and focus on our activity,
but you're going to get bored.

1530
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,890
Your brain is going to get bored with 
just driving,

1531
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:58,480
so your brain is gonna.
Start thinking about things,

1532
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:03,660
so percentage of your brain will start 
coming up with ideas and you start 

1533
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,080
pondering things and questioning 
relationships,

1534
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:06,910
and you start breaking down your life 
while you're driving.

1535
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:08,920
No Stereo on.
Now when you got the music on,

1536
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:12,370
you listen to that and then you're.
You're often no thinking land,

1537
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:13,600
you know,
that's the one.

1538
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:18,630
One of the most dangerous things about 
the media is the fact that it's so 

1539
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:20,830
pervasive and it's so easy to get to and
it's so easy to just sit there and watch

1540
01:06:20,831 --> 01:06:22,780
and just get sucked into it and never 
think at all.

1541
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:27,940
I know I've been.
I've been addicted to the 24 hour news 

1542
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:28,270
cycle in this last few years and it just
drives me nuts.

1543
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:29,900
Is the day.
Do you watch?

1544
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:31,940
Oh,
well it's just on in the background.

1545
01:06:31,941 --> 01:06:33,590
So it's like I'm at the computer but 
it's on,

1546
01:06:33,591 --> 01:06:35,450
in the background.
Can you sleep to news?

1547
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:36,740
Uh,
no.

1548
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,510
No.
He sleeps till dead TV at all.

1549
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,280
No,
I don't.

1550
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:42,470
Fuck all that.
That's a sickness.

1551
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,450
Is that getting real sleep?
Sounds a little.

1552
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,300
No.
I always do the 40 minutes.

1553
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:48,290
Snipper everybody.
I know that they watch TV.

1554
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,390
It was button on your TV.
That's cool.

1555
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,860
And a timer.
I mean.

1556
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:52,540
Really?
Yeah.

1557
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,680
That's cool.
You do a 40 minute snooze,

1558
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,420
40 minutes.
What do you watch?

1559
01:06:56,421 --> 01:06:59,840
Late night television cartoons.
Cartoon network.

1560
01:06:59,841 --> 01:07:02,420
So you're not sleeping while the TV's on
TV shuts itself off.

1561
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:08,640
That's sort of different.
I mean I have watched TV before I go to 

1562
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,901
bed,
but I thought you were just sleeping 

1563
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:10,901
with the television and you don't give a
fuck.

1564
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:11,390
Tom and Jerry's are lagging like no rem 
sleep.

1565
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:13,860
He's like barely.
Barely dream it.

1566
01:07:13,861 --> 01:07:15,740
Listening to books on tape.
Yeah.

1567
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:20,741
You got to trick.
You have to constantly trick your mind 

1568
01:07:20,741 --> 01:07:22,841
and you're four years old.
I woke up this morning and I have the 

1569
01:07:22,841 --> 01:07:24,620
weirdest flight ones because I bought 
this cd on the laws of attraction.

1570
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:25,500
This,
uh,

1571
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:29,540
this crazy woman who claims to be 
channeling some,

1572
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:30,630
some,
you know,

1573
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,490
the secret or what?
No,

1574
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,850
it was another one that was the laws of 
attraction.

1575
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:36,680
I forget her name,
but anyway,

1576
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:41,770
she talks in this strange way,
like when she's channeling this like 

1577
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:42,360
Super Dad.
Oh,

1578
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:43,970
Blonde Lady,
right?

1579
01:07:43,971 --> 01:07:44,990
You know,
when it's on Itunes,

1580
01:07:44,991 --> 01:07:47,060
I'll tell you princess somebody or 
something.

1581
01:07:47,061 --> 01:07:48,770
I've seen that somewhere because,
uh,

1582
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:51,830
yeah,
someone showed me that one.

1583
01:07:51,831 --> 01:07:54,300
So I like that,
you know,

1584
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:58,730
that speaks of.
I read the secret and I found it,

1585
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:01,980
found it to something that I enjoyed.
So there's this woman in panels,

1586
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,210
this

1587
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:06,060
for a deity called Abraham fell asleep,
bloods.

1588
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:11,830
I listened to everything.
I have a very open mind and even if I 

1589
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:11,830
think someone,
it sounds crazy,

1590
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:12,170
you're channeling something,
okay,

1591
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,870
maybe you are crazy,
but maybe in your crazy,

1592
01:08:14,871 --> 01:08:17,210
in actual true belief,
you may have it.

1593
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:22,300
So you're communicating with his deity.
Maybe you can bypass some of the 

1594
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:26,140
pitfalls and roadblocks and human 
consciousness and maybe you could see 

1595
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:27,500
things that other people can truly see.
So maybe you are crazy.

1596
01:08:27,501 --> 01:08:32,501
Maybe you are full of shit,
but maybe you still have some good 

1597
01:08:32,501 --> 01:08:34,241
points.
I'm willing to let that be a 

1598
01:08:34,241 --> 01:08:34,241
possibility.
So I listen to 90 people do all kinds of

1599
01:08:34,241 --> 01:08:38,981
different conversations and all kinds of
different lectures and so I was 

1600
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:42,311
listening to this and I fell asleep 
listening to it so it was on the plane 

1601
01:08:42,311 --> 01:08:45,170
for like a five hour flight and it's 
like hours and hours of lectures of this

1602
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:47,990
woman talking through this man 
channeling wow.

1603
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:52,790
Telling you love life is loving all this
nutty fucking new age type shit.

1604
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:55,220
She's channeling for this deity and the 
strange voice.

1605
01:08:55,221 --> 01:09:00,221
She's a inflecting sorry w I landed just
thinking like I'm fucking Harry Potter 

1606
01:09:00,741 --> 01:09:05,741
movies.
Is it have fucking program something in 

1607
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:09,191
your brain.
You're going to be the government 

1608
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:09,191
license tank and next thing you know 
you're going to be like,

1609
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:10,420
what was that movie with Denzel 
Washington Sundry?

1610
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,190
Made spotless mind or so?
You've reprogrammed yourself.

1611
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,500
Totally wasn't moving something,
man.

1612
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:18,920
Denzel Washington movie running,
man.

1613
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:19,550
No,
no,

1614
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,860
fuck mean.
I'm at Man on a Shannon the fuck.

1615
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:28,300
He's a security guard.
There was a security for the girl and 

1616
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,290
she gets kidnapped and have been 
program.

1617
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:35,291
He was programmed when he was fucking 
terminator trying to help anymore.

1618
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:39,760
Man.
How dare you duck.

1619
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:41,270
I'm now going to get it,
man.

1620
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:46,300
It was a movie where they brainwashed 
him when he was younger and then they 

1621
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:46,300
activated him.

1622
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:47,200
Oh yeah.
No,

1623
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:48,640
no.
Fuck you man.

1624
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,910
I'm the other one where the guy,
they tried to get the guys a little kid.

1625
01:09:52,911 --> 01:09:57,410
You dickhead fucking Dick.
That's not Denzel Washington.

1626
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,570
Let's Macaulay Culkin.
Same Guy.

1627
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:03,350
I hate not being able to remember shit.
So annoying.

1628
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,600
Yeah.
Is there a memory supplement?

1629
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:07,220
Has anybody ever taken a memory 
supplement?

1630
01:10:07,221 --> 01:10:08,840
I mean,
what's good?

1631
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:10,820
Is that real?
Because I had heard it was bullshit.

1632
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:13,880
I heard Gingko was bullshitting.
If you haven't started yet,

1633
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:15,690
cool.
What?

1634
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,300
What milligrams?
I don't remember.

1635
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,820
Can I get to talk about this off air you
had?

1636
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:23,690
Do you feel that you find,
you forget things as you get older,

1637
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:25,760
you forget things because you have too 
much information.

1638
01:10:25,761 --> 01:10:26,780
I mean,
I don't feel like,

1639
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:29,480
uh,
I don't recall at this point,

1640
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:32,230
but yeah.
You know what I do you,

1641
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:37,300
I do notice that there is a,
some sort of a scientific theory about 

1642
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:41,741
the amount of people that we can store 
in our brain and I absolutely believe 

1643
01:10:41,741 --> 01:10:44,801
that they say it's 150 people have room 
for 150 faces and names they recognize.

1644
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:50,770
I have recognized someone that I didn't 
know was still in my database where you 

1645
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:53,150
have to re assimilate the memory and you
go,

1646
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:57,530
oh,
that's a weird thing man.

1647
01:10:57,531 --> 01:10:59,630
It's like your brain is going,
oh well we've got a dust this off.

1648
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:00,470
Hold on.
We have it.

1649
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,310
Which way?
Back here.

1650
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,560
So we're back here.
And then the dudes given me information.

1651
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,460
Do you remember,
man,

1652
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:06,050
we used to play pool together and white 
plains.

1653
01:11:06,051 --> 01:11:07,100
I'm like,
Oh shit.

1654
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,750
And then I'm going way back here.
Okay.

1655
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,670
I got the file.
I've got the.

1656
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,570
Because you,
you know,

1657
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:19,910
this year traveling,
I've been traveling around this year 

1658
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:19,910
meeting,
you know,

1659
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:22,620
thousands of people,
hundreds of people every weekend and 

1660
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:22,620
different cities.
Right?

1661
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:22,620
So you're meeting all these different 
people.

1662
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:27,050
Do you find then you start having that 
happen more where you don't when you 

1663
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:28,260
come back to la?
I mean especially if you like,

1664
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:31,470
if you meet someone who's interesting 
and you wind up talking to this dude and

1665
01:11:31,471 --> 01:11:32,820
you know,
you talked to him on the Internet,

1666
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
well that's an internet.
You've got an internet memory now you 

1667
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,000
know this guy is a part of your Internet
group.

1668
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,250
You know,
if you email me,

1669
01:11:38,251 --> 01:11:43,251
I'll my message board people sign up for
my message board and sometimes there's 

1670
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:43,700
some cool people have some interesting 
things and what can you.

1671
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:48,730
Now that guy's a nickname in my.
My things have names of people that I 

1672
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:49,350
can store in my mind.

1673
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,210
I mean there's like 150.
That's where they say,

1674
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,890
I really do find it really is.
It doesn't seem like a data issue.

1675
01:11:56,100 --> 01:12:01,100
It seems like a data processing issue.
It's like we're not supposed to have 

1676
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,131
access.
This may fucking people like our 

1677
01:12:04,131 --> 01:12:06,171
hardware is not set up for this.
It's like we're trying to run quake for 

1678
01:12:06,171 --> 01:12:07,620
a 1982 fucking pc,
you know,

1679
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:09,360
that's what it is.
We're going to have to get little,

1680
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:14,400
you know,
32 gigabyte chips that we can sort of 

1681
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:14,610
plug in behind her ear or something like
that.

1682
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:16,740
You imagined just for names and phone 
numbers,

1683
01:12:16,741 --> 01:12:19,200
if they could figure out how to update 
the database of your mind,

1684
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,650
it might have just download stuff into 
your little.

1685
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:25,170
Well that'll be out there soon.
It's got to be.

1686
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:27,090
If you can think it,
if you can think of.

1687
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:32,120
They're gonna.
They're gonna get there as long as they 

1688
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:32,120
keep tampering and they always will.

1689
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:32,130
I'm,
that's what people do.

1690
01:12:32,131 --> 01:12:34,260
We keep trying to figure out what's the 
coolest,

1691
01:12:34,261 --> 01:12:35,910
best shit and they're going to learn.
They're gonna.

1692
01:12:35,911 --> 01:12:40,911
Learn from it.
As long as we don't blow ourselves off 

1693
01:12:40,911 --> 01:12:42,741
the face of the earth.
We got some petty shit coming from 

1694
01:12:42,741 --> 01:12:42,741
nobody.
Shit.

1695
01:12:42,741 --> 01:12:42,741
Yeah,
it's,

1696
01:12:42,741 --> 01:12:43,090
it's,
um,

1697
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,690
they're developing skin that can feel.
That's artificial.

1698
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:46,750
Really.
Yes.

1699
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:50,650
Artificial skin that you can feel with 
their have artificial limb.

1700
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,830
What do you mean?
What are you gonna be able to look.

1701
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,840
You attach it to your finger and you can
make your finger like 40 feet long and 

1702
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,960
you can touch stuff eventually.
Ultimately they want you to be able to 

1703
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,021
be sensitive,
like you can pick up a piece of paper 

1704
01:13:03,021 --> 01:13:03,021
with it or you could hold a thick mug.
Oh really?

1705
01:13:03,021 --> 01:13:07,131
Be able to touch and feel things.
You're going to get electrical impulses 

1706
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:12,321
from this artificial hands so they can 
just go into your nerve endings and 

1707
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:14,530
they're gonna figure out how to make it 
so your brain thinks this is a hand,

1708
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:17,050
so they figured out the conversion of 
their work to like.

1709
01:13:17,190 --> 01:13:19,920
I mean,
I don't know how long it is or how close

1710
01:13:19,921 --> 01:13:24,921
it is,
but I know that this is an ultimate 

1711
01:13:24,921 --> 01:13:26,901
goal.
They're trying to figure out a what 

1712
01:13:26,901 --> 01:13:26,901
would be some uses for that.
You know about fake humans,

1713
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,790
how they gonna make fake people do 
depending flashlight.

1714
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:33,000
That's the real thing that are flushed 
with thing is artificial life.

1715
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,950
That's the real thing.
That's really,

1716
01:13:34,951 --> 01:13:38,300
really possible.
It's really possible we don't know what,

1717
01:13:38,301 --> 01:13:39,570
uh,
what life really is.

1718
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:41,370
You know,
technology might be life,

1719
01:13:41,371 --> 01:13:46,371
it might be life in some sort of an 
embryotic form and it has to break out 

1720
01:13:46,371 --> 01:13:47,430
of this like a caterpillar that becomes 
a butterfly.

1721
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,640
This might with we're,
we're seeing what technology that people

1722
01:13:50,641 --> 01:13:54,030
created today in 2010.
We might be seeing just the,

1723
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:59,140
you know,
just this egg shell that's about to 

1724
01:13:59,140 --> 01:13:59,140
break and this new thing is going to 
hatch out of it.

1725
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,440
I A guy,
I could use a,

1726
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:02,340
you know,
a,

1727
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:06,120
a robot around the house that had 
sensitive skin,

1728
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:10,470
smooth mouth pretty lit.
So that would be so strange.

1729
01:14:10,471 --> 01:14:12,160
We just had this really

1730
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:17,160
super hot robot that you could fuck 
whenever you wanted and you didn't have 

1731
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:17,160
to feed her,
you could shut her off,

1732
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,150
you can do whatever you wanted when you 
turned around and was like,

1733
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:20,750
oh,
we fucking up.

1734
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:24,670
Clearly this is possible.
Clearly these scientists are,

1735
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,080
are putting their,
uh,

1736
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,480
who is going to the energy in the right 
place,

1737
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:33,510
tolerate their wife's bullshit.
When you can fuck this super hot robot 

1738
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:37,021
porn star.
Probably be something annoying and 

1739
01:14:37,021 --> 01:14:37,021
gross.
Change your filter,

1740
01:14:37,021 --> 01:14:39,480
you know,
that would be a load out of her snatch.

1741
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,820
That wouldn't be a good job.
What if she's absolutely artificial?

1742
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:43,980
Even her,
you know,

1743
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:49,080
her hormones are everything.
What if it literally is like an 

1744
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:49,510
artificial person,
you know,

1745
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:52,780
but doesn't age.
She blames her own filter.

1746
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:54,370
Yeah.
Queens around pussy.

1747
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,620
Fuck yeah.
She cleans her own filter.

1748
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:58,540
Hey,
why don't you just clean your own filter

1749
01:14:58,541 --> 01:14:58,900
already.

1750
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,530
There's a problem.
Can you clean my filter?

1751
01:15:00,531 --> 01:15:01,600
And why don't you put it in your own 
filter.

1752
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:05,830
You embarrassed all the time.
There was already problems with that.

1753
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:10,000
If you could actually have these totally
controllable artificial people where you

1754
01:15:10,001 --> 01:15:13,660
could program in their personality,
make them super accepting and docile and

1755
01:15:13,661 --> 01:15:14,530
always,
you know,

1756
01:15:14,531 --> 01:15:17,560
always kind and sweet and affection to 
you.

1757
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:20,020
What would people even get in 
relationships anymore?

1758
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:24,550
Would do a dudes God touches.
If you're an ugly fat guy,

1759
01:15:24,551 --> 01:15:26,980
you can just buy the super,
super,

1760
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:30,790
insanely hot chick that's fake.
I think.

1761
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:32,890
Go to movies with her and Shit.
She'll go to the movies with you.

1762
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:33,330
No,
no.

1763
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:38,370
That's the end.
We didn't even know he wouldn't even 

1764
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:38,370
know if it was a real person,
but at the end,

1765
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:41,761
and they'll be like some old fat fucked 
up dude with no teach shit all over his 

1766
01:15:41,761 --> 01:15:41,761
clothes.

1767
01:15:41,761 --> 01:15:42,400
She doesn't care.
She's a robot.

1768
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:47,550
She's hot as fuck.
She looks like traci lords in her prime 

1769
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:47,550
and they're holding hands at the movie 
theater.

1770
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:48,850
People getting pissed off.
Fucking real woman.

1771
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:53,940
Except the way you would know a little 
bit the way you would know is because 

1772
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:53,940
when it first happens,
there'd only be five models.

1773
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:54,910
You know,
there'd be the blonde,

1774
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:57,010
you know,
there'd be the Burnett,

1775
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:03,340
so you'd see them again.
You're like smart cars going around or 

1776
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:04,780
whatever and they'll do anything.
They'll suck your dick and a taxi cab.

1777
01:16:04,781 --> 01:16:09,190
They don't give a fuck the robot and 
people are going to go off.

1778
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:11,830
It's gonna be crazy.
Debit probably have like dead eyes.

1779
01:16:11,831 --> 01:16:12,910
You know when you look in somebodies 
eyes,

1780
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:16,060
you tell maybe,
maybe the puppy dog eyes,

1781
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:21,061
maybe the crush.
You maybe fall in love with that robot 

1782
01:16:21,061 --> 01:16:21,061
and you're trying to figure out a way to
breed with her had puppies and that's.

1783
01:16:21,061 --> 01:16:23,220
Maybe that's the apocalypse.
We do figure out a way to breed,

1784
01:16:23,221 --> 01:16:26,140
but can you tell me a little bit about 
this flashlight since we're on the topic

1785
01:16:26,141 --> 01:16:27,670
of,
of having sex with.

1786
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:31,020
It's a thing that you really.
It is.

1787
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,780
Fuck this one.
I think some of the other part.

1788
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:38,390
This is.
This is your sponsor,

1789
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:39,210
your show.
Yes.

1790
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:41,980
Manufacturer believe Austin,
Texas.

1791
01:16:41,981 --> 01:16:45,760
That's where the company's located.
He hung out with that group of companies

1792
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:48,110
can get in there.
That'd be good.

1793
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:51,580
I'll turn it for me.
Don't really feel like touching.

1794
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:58,030
I should feel it.
You should feel like no one is lax with 

1795
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:58,030
this.
Yes.

1796
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,000
This is just a sample that they sent us.
Just trust it.

1797
01:16:59,140 --> 01:16:59,950
Okay.
All right.

1798
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:01,540
Yep.
You're pretty good,

1799
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:03,040
right?
That the finger and I'm not going to put

1800
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:03,360
my finger.
No,

1801
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:04,030
no.
It feels like it.

1802
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:06,820
Just feel it.
I can imagine.

1803
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,830
I can imagine.
Might have a very imagination

1804
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,270
that is.
That's interesting.

1805
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,390
Better than the cow.
Now let me ask you this.

1806
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:17,360
I don't have to ask you whether or not 
you masturbate because of course you do,

1807
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:23,080
but I.
But would you be willing to buy a 

1808
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:23,540
masturbation tool that would make 
masturbation better?

1809
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:29,380
Probably not.
Right then you have to sort of as open 

1810
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:29,380
does get a free one.
Because I was like,

1811
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:30,560
yeah,
I wouldn't.

1812
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,850
Would I be willing to find that one 
left?

1813
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:33,830
Hold on.
I'm just kidding.

1814
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:34,670
I'm just kidding.
Actually.

1815
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:36,300
Well,
you know,

1816
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:40,910
might be fun just for conversation at 
parties or something like that.

1817
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,140
Hey know I've got.
I'll give it to you.

1818
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:43,700
I'll go find it.
It's in here somewhere.

1819
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:44,070
Yeah.
No,

1820
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,620
I mean you don't know what kind of porn 
is Tom Greenlight do?

1821
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:48,890
You definitely would have to be in a 
sealed rapper.

1822
01:17:48,891 --> 01:17:49,840
Let's put it as a common.

1823
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:52,880
A seals.
Hermetically sealed plastic.

1824
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:54,010
Absolutely.
Insurance.

1825
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:56,350
I would not advise you to fuck that.
Yeah.

1826
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:00,530
You don't want Brian Cowen touch that.
This has been in touch.

1827
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:02,810
This has been unsealed.
Is it a signature thing?

1828
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,790
I think Ricky Schroder even touched that
one.

1829
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,790
Did Ricky Schroder test?
Ricky Schroder touched.

1830
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,300
And so does it do anything?
Does it vibrate or anything?

1831
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,570
So you don't need that?
No,

1832
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,640
it's just a.
it's just that's what it is.

1833
01:18:14,641 --> 01:18:16,190
Just that you know what it is,
man,

1834
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:21,110
it just makes it way better feeling than
your hand and you're not getting any.

1835
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:23,780
You're not getting any signal from it.
It's patented rubber.

1836
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:28,850
You know,
they have their own patent on how it 

1837
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:28,850
really feels great America made in the 
USA.

1838
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,480
Very interesting thing.
These fish in a bucket.

1839
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:37,130
Look at that.
That's what he calls it.

1840
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:39,110
Fill out.
This is what it's called.

1841
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:41,750
This is called deer in a tree.
He just making up names.

1842
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:47,020
It's not what it's called.
It's a great product for,

1843
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:53,450
for 60 bucks or whatever it costs.
It's totally worth it.

1844
01:18:53,451 --> 01:18:55,700
It makes beating off way more fun.
What kind of porn do you like?

1845
01:18:55,710 --> 01:19:00,710
Why are you an amateur guy or take off,
take your pants off when you asked that 

1846
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:00,710
question.
You know,

1847
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:01,880
I don't even know anymore,
man.

1848
01:19:01,881 --> 01:19:06,881
It's gotten so crazy out there.
Magazine kids today are not so crazy.

1849
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,560
Well,
what's gotten crazy man?

1850
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,760
Well,
I think basically just the sort of 

1851
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,800
instant access to anything online.
It's kind of starting actually to get to

1852
01:19:18,801 --> 01:19:19,580
the point where,
um,

1853
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:24,830
you know,
it's not as an amazing thing.

1854
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:25,610
Porn,
you know,

1855
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:27,230
I was,
you know,

1856
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:27,900
when,
when,

1857
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,180
when we were kids,
you know,

1858
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:31,480
when we were,
when we were like,

1859
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,330
you know,
when I was,

1860
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,700
when I was a kid,
they didn't have that obviously,

1861
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,230
so you'd be excited when,
you know,

1862
01:19:40,231 --> 01:19:41,900
like when a sears catalog comes,
you know,

1863
01:19:41,901 --> 01:19:42,720
you'd be excited,
you know,

1864
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:43,780
this is,
this is,

1865
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,370
this is what you would,
uh,

1866
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:47,600
you know,
there was not this access to it.

1867
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:47,910
So to,
it's,

1868
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:52,930
it's almost like overwhelming to me now.
I think I've watched too much of it in 

1869
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:53,660
my life and I'm not interested in not 
much anymore,

1870
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:59,040
you know,
to be honest with you when you're 

1871
01:19:59,040 --> 01:19:59,040
campaigning for a nice curl.
When I start,

1872
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,310
when I started seeing it online and 
video,

1873
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:06,370
to be honest with you,
I've watched it a lot because I was 

1874
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:06,370
interesting in the web streaming 
technology.

1875
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:10,920
Yeah.
So I would go on some of the sites just 

1876
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:10,920
to kind

1877
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:10,920
of cuts it just for purely 
technological.

1878
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,420
It was sort of like a business or 
research kind of thing.

1879
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:15,810
Because I'm doing my web show,
I want to see that the streaming quality

1880
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:20,811
was good and things like,
and you can get the most data from the 

1881
01:20:20,811 --> 01:20:20,811
facial section.
That's what I find.

1882
01:20:20,811 --> 01:20:23,850
Yeah.
But uh,

1883
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:25,790
but uh,
it's,

1884
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:26,800
it's,
I,

1885
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:29,520
I think that's what's going to happen to
us.

1886
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,880
Are we going to go,
are we all going to go crazy because of 

1887
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:34,880
this porn everywhere and these people 
fucking,

1888
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:39,291
they're just going crazy because they'd 
been suppressed for so long until 

1889
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,080
everybody comes down and then they're 
going to realize that,

1890
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:45,090
well,
I don't really like watching all this 

1891
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,080
crazy mouth fucking until tools throw up
and coming in their eyeballs know shit.

1892
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,930
I don't really like that.
You go back to making love videos,

1893
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:50,920
they're actually better than the porn 
fucking video.

1894
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:51,620
Oh,
I've never heard of that.

1895
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:54,510
Bull in really in love.
And they just sit there and make love.

1896
01:20:54,511 --> 01:20:57,660
It's really pretty nice.
This is a better way.

1897
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,040
Some fetish site.
You're into it.

1898
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,540
You don't even like professionals,
boy and like fucking scabs.

1899
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:07,350
The love videos highlighting the porn 
union.

1900
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,210
Very nice.
Oh,

1901
01:21:09,211 --> 01:21:12,540
and where do you find that?
Google love making love videos.

1902
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:18,930
The website,
I've never heard of this one chick 

1903
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:19,470
that's like the most famous blowjob 
artists in all of the world.

1904
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,160
I don't remember her name,
but she's really feeling it was.

1905
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:23,260
But she,
uh,

1906
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:24,110
it's,
I,

1907
01:21:24,111 --> 01:21:25,460
uh,
I deep throat.com.

1908
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:27,110
Heather,
that's her name is heather.

1909
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,340
Heather something on and she's got like,
I dunno,

1910
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,830
100 fucking videos and they're all of 
her blowing.

1911
01:21:31,831 --> 01:21:36,831
Her husband blown this dude everywhere.
And she has the most ridiculous lack of 

1912
01:21:37,651 --> 01:21:39,270
gag reflexes.
She's got none.

1913
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:43,770
So if he's got a big tank,
she's down to the balls,

1914
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:44,800
look in his balls every time.

1915
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:45,900
Does nothing for me.
They have,

1916
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:51,010
they have,
they have videos all over the place on 

1917
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:53,400
the Internet,
like he's turned his wife sucking his 

1918
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,320
dick and to like a website.
That's an interesting way to go.

1919
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:59,000
Do you like it more if you'd like more 
violent videos?

1920
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,180
I don't like it.
Well,

1921
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:02,620
I like her.
She's not doing it violent.

1922
01:22:02,621 --> 01:22:07,621
She's not throwing up something.
I know that she can just do without 

1923
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:07,621
gagging.
That's the crazy thing.

1924
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:11,000
The other ones,
like there's a lot of sasha great porn 

1925
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,540
that fucking hard to watch.
That chickens are a mile away.

1926
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:13,770
You did the first,
uh,

1927
01:22:13,771 --> 01:22:15,780
watching two girls,
one cup video,

1928
01:22:15,781 --> 01:22:16,680
right?
Did you do that?

1929
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,740
It wasn't the first.
Oh No,

1930
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:21,650
we did.
It was watching.

1931
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:24,040
It was.
The shot was on the reactions.

1932
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,160
What was that called?
What's that called when?

1933
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:29,180
The reaction reaction?
Video video.

1934
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:31,160
That was one of those.

1935
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:36,400
It was good one for reaction videos 
because everybody knew by the sound of 

1936
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:36,510
the music what was going on if you'd 
already seen it.

1937
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:41,540
That was a very odd sort of blip on the 
pop culture radar the day that that came

1938
01:22:41,641 --> 01:22:42,080
out,
right?

1939
01:22:42,081 --> 01:22:44,820
Yeah.
And there was this site dedicated to one

1940
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:48,170
video and everybody went and watched a 
couple of days,

1941
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:51,720
got millions and millions and millions 
of views.

1942
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:57,110
I joke about it and I bring it up on 
stage sometimes and it's incredible how 

1943
01:22:57,110 --> 01:23:01,431
many people have seen it.
And I think what's interesting about it 

1944
01:23:01,431 --> 01:23:03,921
is it repulsed people so instantly that 
it didn't really catch on like it did.

1945
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:05,980
That hasn't since has it

1946
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,140
where there's been one domain name comes
out,

1947
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:10,830
you know,
three girls more.

1948
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:12,990
Whatever you guys want to.
There's nothing written.

1949
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:18,750
Two guys went,
horse guy gets fucked to death by a 

1950
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:18,750
horse.
Oh,

1951
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:19,630
I've heard about that in Seattle and he 
had to change the law.

1952
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:21,400
Five hands.
One girl was another one.

1953
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:24,640
Oh Jesus Christ.
There was a guy,

1954
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:29,760
I think I've told this story before,
but I'll tell you he made that up 

1955
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:29,760
because you're hearing.
That's what I'm saying.

1956
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,850
The point I'm making is that I know will
take off.

1957
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,510
It was a dude that I know who's friend 
was dating

1958
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:36,310
porn star and they were trying to.
He was trying to reconcile the fact that

1959
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:38,530
she fucked guys and this was just a job 
and blah blah,

1960
01:23:38,531 --> 01:23:43,531
blah blah blah.
Just kinda like put it in the back of 

1961
01:23:43,531 --> 01:23:43,531
his head.
And um,

1962
01:23:43,531 --> 01:23:46,740
she came home with the contract and 
she's going over the different parts of 

1963
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:46,740
the contract and he goes,
what's,

1964
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:49,390
what's this air tight?
And she goes,

1965
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,590
Oh,
airtight means a dick.

1966
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,040
And every hall he goes,
what?

1967
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,310
What am I asked?
One of my pussy,

1968
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,070
one of my mouth.
He goes,

1969
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,840
okay,
this is over.

1970
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,100
That was,
that was a them airtight,

1971
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:01,850
cracked up the fact that they actually 
have a,

1972
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:05,800
a name for it,
plugged up with Dick's.

1973
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,960
And then what are you gonna?
Come home and cuddle after that.

1974
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:09,970
Share tight.
Unbelievable.

1975
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:11,240
Yeah.
And so,

1976
01:24:11,241 --> 01:24:11,680
and,
and,

1977
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:16,681
and what happened?
He just walked out the door and never 

1978
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:16,681
talked to her again.
And I was fucking.

1979
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:16,681
Clinics would airtight.
Yeah,

1980
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:17,020
they,
I think,

1981
01:24:17,021 --> 01:24:17,610
you know,
when,

1982
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:22,630
when you've,
your girlfriend's got airtight and her 

1983
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:23,560
contract,
that's really strange

1984
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:26,200
thing that a lot of the people in the 
porn business do.

1985
01:24:26,201 --> 01:24:29,440
They figure out a way to have boyfriends
and girlfriends and be in relationships,

1986
01:24:29,441 --> 01:24:31,540
but they still fuck the fuck other 
people when they work,

1987
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,040
but they're only allowed to do it when 
they're working.

1988
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,700
Yeah,
it must,

1989
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:37,990
it must because we're also,
uh,

1990
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:38,820
you know,
uh,

1991
01:24:38,821 --> 01:24:43,821
accustomed to seeing it now that people 
probably out there actually can justify 

1992
01:24:43,821 --> 01:24:44,210
it in their mind because,
oh,

1993
01:24:44,211 --> 01:24:49,211
this is a legitimate profession here.
There's one is the Tom Green sex tape 

1994
01:24:49,211 --> 01:24:53,681
come out when he was a pop.
Is there barrymore dealing with 100 to a

1995
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,720
hundred different women's.
You hate the hate MACs.

1996
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,060
What's that?
Do you hate?

1997
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:04,870
What do you know?
That's something I don't think I could 

1998
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:06,290
ever ever see myself doing.
Is there one that exists though that you

1999
01:25:06,291 --> 01:25:07,200
know of?
Uh,

2000
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:12,220
there's not,
there's definitely not one that I know 

2001
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:12,220
of.
You know,

2002
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:12,770
you don't videotape yourself,
you know,

2003
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,600
not regularly,
but I think it's from paranoia of A.

2004
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:18,890
I'm not going to say I never did it once
in my life,

2005
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:20,020
but you know,
the,

2006
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:25,090
the thing is,
is I immediately deleted it and was a 

2007
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:26,270
strong move immediately deleted.

2008
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:28,310
It didn't keep it around,
you know,

2009
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,780
uh,
honestly,

2010
01:25:29,781 --> 01:25:31,550
you know,
I didn't even really,

2011
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:34,010
really want to watch it to be honest 
with you.

2012
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:34,780
You loved it.
Yeah.

2013
01:25:34,781 --> 01:25:37,440
It was fun.
The process of videotape,

2014
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,220
you don't want to watch it though.
Not really.

2015
01:25:40,221 --> 01:25:45,221
No.
It was kind of freaked me out when I do 

2016
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:45,221
it.
I'm just so disgusted.

2017
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:46,670
It depresses me in the body,
but I do have one.

2018
01:25:46,671 --> 01:25:47,540
Well,
what depresses you?

2019
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,430
Huh?
What depresses me?

2020
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:50,090
It's just A.
I don't know.

2021
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,780
Watching yourself as grown.
Like,

2022
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:55,610
wait a minute,
Brian,

2023
01:25:55,611 --> 01:26:00,611
stop right now.
Listen to how you're advertising your 

2024
01:26:00,611 --> 01:26:02,651
sex.
You're a single man and you're saying 

2025
01:26:02,651 --> 01:26:02,651
you have depressing.
I mean,

2026
01:26:02,651 --> 01:26:02,651
would you,
do you like watching yourself?

2027
01:26:02,651 --> 01:26:05,090
Like do you masturbate and it like.
I mean,

2028
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:06,950
do you masturbate with looking at 
yourself in the mirror?

2029
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:11,640
Why would you want to watch yourself 
watching yourself having sex and you try

2030
01:26:11,641 --> 01:26:12,450
to recreate a life.

2031
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:15,800
Wipe yourself on news radio.
Why would you having sex?

2032
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:18,650
It doesn't depress me.
God.

2033
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:23,770
No,
I just don't like watching myself have 

2034
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:23,770
sex.
Okay,

2035
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:23,770
I see.
I totally.

2036
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:23,990
I totally see what you're saying.
It's disturbing.

2037
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:27,380
What about if you do pov style,
that would be cool.

2038
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,510
That would be slapping iphone.
Do you checks?

2039
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,630
That would be foreign press record.
Slap an iphone.

2040
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:37,680
Do Charge capture as what did you do?
Have one with me of when I was like 16 

2041
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:37,740
or 17,
you know,

2042
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:42,790
using my dad's vhs camera that would 
make like old home movies about carrots 

2043
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:46,031
attack me and Steph and I would like set
it up in my room and stuff and I have 

2044
01:26:46,031 --> 01:26:46,160
one of like,
but then I look at it and like,

2045
01:26:46,161 --> 01:26:47,690
can I get in trouble for watching 
myself?

2046
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:51,290
You know,
your child pornography with yourself.

2047
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:54,590
Well,
could I get for myself their girlfriend?

2048
01:26:54,790 --> 01:26:55,550
Yeah.
Yeah,

2049
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:57,050
probably.
Right.

2050
01:26:57,051 --> 01:26:59,330
I should just throw that tape right.
Well you got get arrested.

2051
01:26:59,331 --> 01:27:02,140
Probably if you could be public,
could be illegal master patient.

2052
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:07,150
It could be considered a child 
pornography to catch kids for 16 years 

2053
01:27:07,641 --> 01:27:12,641
old.
Could you be charged for being in 

2054
01:27:12,641 --> 01:27:15,281
possession of child pornography?
Is that kids are getting their cell 

2055
01:27:15,281 --> 01:27:16,820
phones taken away and they find photos 
of them.

2056
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:20,330
Girls are getting charged with child 
pornography because they have a photo of

2057
01:27:20,331 --> 01:27:23,120
themselves for themselves that they sent
to him.

2058
01:27:23,121 --> 01:27:24,920
Boy,
they're charged with child pornography.

2059
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:27,050
So you probably should destroy that 
tape.

2060
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,960
White tape.
Well that's like the,

2061
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:31,090
you know the old tape,
isn't it?

2062
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:36,110
To allegedly had a to B,
how many gay guys are frantically 

2063
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:38,360
searching the internet for a video of 
Brian at 15 masturbating.

2064
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,990
Not a nice thought.
No,

2065
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:43,990
not for me personally,
but you know,

2066
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:44,720
but the,
the,

2067
01:27:44,721 --> 01:27:45,230
the,
uh,

2068
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:49,320
the um,
podcast.

2069
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:51,440
Tom Green.

2070
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:54,230
No.
So wait,

2071
01:27:54,231 --> 01:27:55,400
what was the,
what was the thing then?

2072
01:27:55,401 --> 01:27:55,850
So,
uh,

2073
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:58,880
um,
yeah,

2074
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:00,380
and it was let's change.
Let's change the topic,

2075
01:28:00,381 --> 01:28:04,880
right?
Sex tapes is marijuana.

2076
01:28:04,881 --> 01:28:09,881
Yeah.
And you know what the subject was 

2077
01:28:09,881 --> 01:28:09,881
getting depressed.
Watching yourself.

2078
01:28:09,881 --> 01:28:09,881
Fuck.
Yup.

2079
01:28:09,881 --> 01:28:11,810
And that he should do pov style.
I love it.

2080
01:28:11,811 --> 01:28:16,811
When your song was released and then w 
was destroying the charts for Tlc and 

2081
01:28:16,811 --> 01:28:17,990
then you gay,
you trl,

2082
01:28:17,991 --> 01:28:19,580
trl.
And then did you,

2083
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:23,210
were you forced to get rid of?
Guess I was forced to for 98 degrees.

2084
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:24,950
That whole thing was,
it's a very,

2085
01:28:24,951 --> 01:28:27,680
um,
it's a very,

2086
01:28:27,681 --> 01:28:29,480
uh,
you know,

2087
01:28:29,481 --> 01:28:30,030
there's a,
there's a,

2088
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:35,110
there's a,
there's a little bit of intrigue here 

2089
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:36,530
behind the story because there was,
you know,

2090
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:41,590
some,
some things done trl that were not 

2091
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:41,690
necessarily ever made public.
Right.

2092
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:44,160
Okay.
Well fill me full detail.

2093
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:45,270
What happened?
What happened,

2094
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,720
like the to the,
and trl isn't necessarily,

2095
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:50,510
it's not necessarily live and all the 
time,

2096
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,740
so it's not on anymore.
Nobody knows the song.

2097
01:28:52,741 --> 01:28:54,030
What was the song and what happened?
Okay.

2098
01:28:54,031 --> 01:28:57,870
So we went to Seattle and we were 
filming bits and Seattle and we thought,

2099
01:28:57,871 --> 01:29:02,871
hey,
this would be funny to do the song 

2100
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:02,871
called the bum bumps on it.
My favorite songs,

2101
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:02,871
ridiculous idea.

2102
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:04,010
And I would go and it was just a silly 
video.

2103
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:06,660
Me going around Seattle saying Obama's 
on the cheese,

2104
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:09,170
my bum's on the rail albums in the boat.
My bumps on the duck.

2105
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:13,260
It was a silly sort of like a doctor zoo
style nursery rhyme,

2106
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:14,840
rap and,
and the,

2107
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:18,730
and the comedy of it was me out in the 
street sticking my ass on everything and

2108
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,730
confusing people and filming the 
reactions.

2109
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:22,410
Right.
And singing this silly song.

2110
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:26,340
And then we played it on my show and we 
said we want this to go to number one on

2111
01:29:26,341 --> 01:29:27,720
total request live,
which is,

2112
01:29:27,721 --> 01:29:32,721
you know,
their countdown music show that they 

2113
01:29:32,721 --> 01:29:32,721
would have every night hosted by Carson 
Daly.

2114
01:29:32,721 --> 01:29:37,400
And I'm.
So we played it on Seattle radio and it 

2115
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:38,220
went to number one.
Instantly.

2116
01:29:38,221 --> 01:29:40,030
This was when my show was on MTV.
It was,

2117
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:43,470
it was really doing well.
Show on MTV show was doing well on MTV.

2118
01:29:43,471 --> 01:29:48,471
People went to number one,
people saw the absurdity of this song 

2119
01:29:48,471 --> 01:29:52,500
knocking 98 degrees,
Brittany Spears in sync and whoever else

2120
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:55,110
was on the j Lo,
I think out of the,

2121
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:57,270
out of the number one spot.
And so we went.

2122
01:29:57,271 --> 01:29:59,340
We played it on the show,
we asked people to vote for it,

2123
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:02,730
people voted for it.
It went to number one on Tuesday.

2124
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,530
Okay.
The show I think aired on a Monday.

2125
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:07,480
It went to number one on a Tuesday.
This is the song.

2126
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:08,570
Yeah.

2127
01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:16,170
My mom like fucking a huge.
This song was.

2128
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:21,740
And this was the first song to be like,
this was right when mp three s just 

2129
01:30:22,531 --> 01:30:24,660
started.
So it was the number one downloaded song

2130
01:30:24,661 --> 01:30:25,530
that year.
I thought you.

2131
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:29,220
I think 14 people downloaded it.
It was a.

2132
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:30,010
It was.
No,

2133
01:30:30,011 --> 01:30:33,870
no,
this was 1999 to 2009.

2134
01:30:33,871 --> 01:30:36,270
So what happened?
So they squashed your song?

2135
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:38,100
Yeah,
it went to number one on Tuesday,

2136
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:40,520
then on Wednesday on Wednesday it was 
number one,

2137
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:41,850
number one again.
Okay.

2138
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:45,450
And then on Thursday it was number one 
again and then we get a call on Thursday

2139
01:30:45,451 --> 01:30:47,250
at the office and they're saying,
guys,

2140
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:51,690
we want you to kind of play ball with us
here.

2141
01:30:51,691 --> 01:30:52,620
And we're like,
well what's the deal?

2142
01:30:52,621 --> 01:30:53,040
He said,
well,

2143
01:30:53,041 --> 01:30:53,880
you know,
we need,

2144
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:58,910
we need you to go on the show on Friday 
and retire the bum bum song and take it 

2145
01:30:58,910 --> 01:30:59,670
off the countdown.

2146
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,510
And we're like,
why?

2147
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,760
It's the number one song in America on 
TV,

2148
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:05,390
man.
Yeah,

2149
01:31:05,391 --> 01:31:06,390
right.
Is Amazing.

2150
01:31:06,391 --> 01:31:07,360
Right?
Money off this.

2151
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:09,750
This is unbelievable.
Let's keep it number one.

2152
01:31:09,751 --> 01:31:14,751
They go,
well the thing is we've pre taped the 

2153
01:31:14,751 --> 01:31:15,480
show next week because Carson's going to
be in San Francisco and all this stuff.

2154
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:20,780
So we're Kinda,
it's Kinda like who we think's going to 

2155
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:22,020
be and we hadn't predicted you erin the 
show on Monday and it instantly going to

2156
01:31:22,021 --> 01:31:27,021
number one,
so it kind of screws up next week's 

2157
01:31:27,021 --> 01:31:27,021
pre-taped,
which is all in the can.

2158
01:31:27,021 --> 01:31:31,220
So can you go on on a Friday and just 
retire it and we'll give you like a 

2159
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:34,971
retirement home plaque and here I was on
MTV and I had my show on MTV and I 

2160
01:31:34,971 --> 01:31:35,220
didn't want to get fired.
Right.

2161
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:40,550
Everybody's already mad at me about all 
this other shit screaming at me all day 

2162
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:40,550
about,
you know,

2163
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:42,660
I want to suck milk out of cows better 
because I think it'll be crazy.

2164
01:31:42,661 --> 01:31:43,770
Let's put it on TV.
And they're like,

2165
01:31:43,771 --> 01:31:46,650
can't you can't do that.
We're arguing nonstop.

2166
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,800
It was like,
it was the most stressful time of my 

2167
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:51,800
life and that's saying something because
I'm pretty stressed out right now to,

2168
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:52,440
not right now,
but most of the time,

2169
01:31:52,441 --> 01:31:53,210
you know,
and so,

2170
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:57,210
so I'm on the show and I'm getting 
yelled at all the time by everybody.

2171
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:58,410
Everyone's always screaming at each 
other,

2172
01:31:58,411 --> 01:31:59,980
trying to know,
make the show crazy

2173
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,600
or make it less crazy.
And then so,

2174
01:32:01,601 --> 01:32:02,350
you know,
I played ball,

2175
01:32:02,351 --> 01:32:04,600
I went in,
I got a nice plaque and you know what?

2176
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:06,790
I'm not even to be honest with you.
Not Well,

2177
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:07,950
yeah.
You know,

2178
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:09,130
I think of it now.
I think,

2179
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:14,131
you know,
we could have rode that thing a little 

2180
01:32:14,131 --> 01:32:14,131
further.
I could have put out a record.

2181
01:32:14,131 --> 01:32:15,070
I probably could have know had some fun 
with that.

2182
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,570
But um,
yeah,

2183
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:17,860
that's what happened.
That's what happened.

2184
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:19,540
That's,
that's interesting man.

2185
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:22,490
That's fucked.
You're fucked by the corporations.

2186
01:32:22,491 --> 01:32:23,200
Yeah,
exactly.

2187
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:28,201
It was a sense that they would probably 
cost them a fuck load of money in 

2188
01:32:28,201 --> 01:32:31,000
theater already.
Pre-Taped reshoot five shows and it's 

2189
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:31,000
like,
how crazy is that?

2190
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:31,810
Now you find out what the rankings are 
like.

2191
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:33,580
It's totally,
they prop them up.

2192
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,350
It probably had deals with the record 
company,

2193
01:32:35,351 --> 01:32:38,800
like we need to push 98 degrees and 
here's $100,000

2194
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:41,770
we need to probably it's illegal.

2195
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:44,800
I mean that's definitely did that.
They did that.

2196
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,510
I never heard any.
Just making shit up.

2197
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:46,970
No,
no.

2198
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:50,530
I'm just throwing shit on the table.
I never did anything like that.

2199
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:53,100
I think it was just basically it was a 
very strange week and uh,

2200
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:53,450
they,
they,

2201
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:55,180
they sort of said it wasn't for that 
week.

2202
01:32:55,181 --> 01:32:57,820
That song could have stayed on the 
countdown and because I can't.

2203
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:02,940
Basically that week was a Republican 
Republic of the week before and what are

2204
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:06,070
you doing Brian?
To be screaming.

2205
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:12,350
They ended the song.
Was that video going out to and that's 

2206
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:12,350
an Ipad,
which is pretty awesome,

2207
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:13,930
but it's actually just streaming on the 
ipad but it's not going out.

2208
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:19,170
That's pretty cool.
People can hear the audio audio but you 

2209
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:19,170
know,
I've,

2210
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:19,480
I've,
I've told that story before.

2211
01:33:19,481 --> 01:33:21,150
I don't think anyone at MTV cares 
anymore.

2212
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,450
It's on.
Well,

2213
01:33:22,451 --> 01:33:24,220
why would they care?
Fuck you.

2214
01:33:24,370 --> 01:33:26,470
You're the one supposed to care.
You could have got paid.

2215
01:33:26,490 --> 01:33:31,490
So driving that fucking song right now 
in the form of a Red Ferrari.

2216
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:33,070
Yeah,
that's true.

2217
01:33:33,071 --> 01:33:37,030
I'm saying it could be rolling with a 
big fat diamond encrusted watch.

2218
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:40,960
Let bitches know and they'd be like,
Tom Green,

2219
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:42,640
how'd you get?
So rich bum,

2220
01:33:42,641 --> 01:33:44,780
bum,
bum bum song was on.

2221
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:48,100
Try to pull it off the an into eminem 
song.

2222
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:53,560
It's just try to pull it off the end.
I was like a song on song and oh you 

2223
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:59,160
know those same song when eminem rapped 
about an m and m wrap.

2224
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:01,170
M and m took the line from the bung 
bumps on.

2225
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:06,220
He says,
why can't I go on TV and let loose when 

2226
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:06,220
it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead 
Moose?

2227
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:10,201
My bum is on your lips,
but bumpers on your lips and if you get 

2228
01:34:10,201 --> 01:34:10,400
lucky I'll give it a little kiss that 
seven.

2229
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:14,020
I'm doing that.
And the thing that's funny about that,

2230
01:34:14,021 --> 01:34:15,310
which is really cool,
is that like,

2231
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:20,340
you know that song,
it's like I hear that all over the 

2232
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:20,340
world.
It says your name in it,

2233
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:20,950
right?
So you're walking through something,

2234
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:26,040
you're walking through an airport in 
Amsterdam or something and it's like,

2235
01:34:26,081 --> 01:34:27,560
you know,
you hear him rapping about it.

2236
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:32,580
It's pretty cool.
Who would've thought that m and M would 

2237
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:32,900
have?
I mean I guess it was pretty awesome and

2238
01:34:32,901 --> 01:34:34,270
it came up,
but I mean just to be around.

2239
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:37,120
I have not met him.
No,

2240
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:39,670
but he let us use that song and Freddy 
got fingered through.

2241
01:34:39,671 --> 01:34:44,671
You know,
we had to license it but he doesn't 

2242
01:34:44,671 --> 01:34:45,040
license music out that much.
He gives a sweet deal.

2243
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:47,410
We've got to put it in the credit roll 
of Freddy got fingered.

2244
01:34:47,411 --> 01:34:48,990
So that was pretty cool.
Thank you.

2245
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:50,260
That is awesome.
Thank you.

2246
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:52,030
Very cool.
Marshall mathers.

2247
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:53,850
You know,
that's pretty cool.

2248
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:57,040
Do you still write music?
Do you have to think about doing another

2249
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,100
hits?
You don't have

2250
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:01,920
a friend of mine who is a really cool 
producer here in town who uh,

2251
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:02,680
who,
uh,

2252
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:07,870
I make music with sometimes the names 
detail and he does a lot of cool music 

2253
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:09,440
and uh,
I just do it for fun.

2254
01:35:09,441 --> 01:35:14,441
I have a home studio for fun.
You got to the pro tools and the MAC 

2255
01:35:14,441 --> 01:35:15,320
computer and he's cool.
Yeah.

2256
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:17,720
So you got your fingers in all aspects 
of show business.

2257
01:35:17,721 --> 01:35:19,370
You're always doing something more like 
a hobby,

2258
01:35:19,371 --> 01:35:20,600
you know,
it's more just a fun thing,

2259
01:35:20,601 --> 01:35:21,620
but it's a fun thing.
You know,

2260
01:35:21,621 --> 01:35:23,960
the songs I make are so ridiculous that 
they're never,

2261
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:27,530
I don't think I'm really there ever 
would be sort of any mainstream.

2262
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:32,660
So I think the standup thing is an 
interesting subject because you didn't 

2263
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:34,140
do standup for a long time.
You did stand up when you were like 15,

2264
01:35:34,141 --> 01:35:37,470
16 and then you stopped for like God,
what?

2265
01:35:37,471 --> 01:35:38,220
Twenty years?

2266
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:43,280
Uh Huh.
I would do it sort of occasionally but 

2267
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:43,280
never sort of as I had an act that I was
working on.

2268
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,500
Launched it.
What made you decide to want to get back

2269
01:35:45,501 --> 01:35:46,400
into it?
Uh,

2270
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,690
you know about a,

2271
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:50,370
a boot boot.
Yeah,

2272
01:35:50,371 --> 01:35:55,371
I do.
That still has the one that's the one 

2273
01:35:55,371 --> 01:35:55,371
word that I get nailed on gifts.
Sear goes sincere.

2274
01:35:55,371 --> 01:35:57,540
You go deep detail.
Canadian beer,

2275
01:35:57,630 --> 01:35:58,540
a boat.
Uh,

2276
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:00,870
you know,
I do when I can do what I can,

2277
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:05,160
I just sort of drink a drink when I can.
And so what happened?

2278
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:05,940
So,

2279
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,490
uh,
well about two years ago,

2280
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:13,620
Rob Schneider came on my show as a guest
on the web show and uh,

2281
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:18,800
his brother John also came up and 
started hanging out with those guys and 

2282
01:36:18,811 --> 01:36:20,670
it was maybe about a year and a half 
ago,

2283
01:36:20,671 --> 01:36:23,310
John said,
he know rob's doing stand up now too.

2284
01:36:23,311 --> 01:36:25,500
He's been touring all year and he said,
rob's gonna start doing stand up.

2285
01:36:25,501 --> 01:36:26,790
You should start doing standup.
And I thought,

2286
01:36:26,791 --> 01:36:28,320
you know,
this would be pretty cool way.

2287
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:33,650
First of all,
it's something that I've been thinking 

2288
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:33,650
about since I was a kid and I was very 
intimidated by it.

2289
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:35,820
I was afraid of it.
It was in the back of my head.

2290
01:36:35,821 --> 01:36:36,630
I was kind of thinking,
you know,

2291
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:38,310
you know,
I don't know,

2292
01:36:38,350 --> 01:36:38,940
just,
you know,

2293
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:44,190
I was so used to doing the show and I 
remember how hard it was when I was a 

2294
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:44,190
teenager,
you know,

2295
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:48,921
when you're 15 years old,
standing up in front of a bunch of 

2296
01:36:48,921 --> 01:36:48,921
college kids,
you know,

2297
01:36:48,921 --> 01:36:48,921
it's,
it was,

2298
01:36:48,921 --> 01:36:48,921
it was,
it was tough.

2299
01:36:48,921 --> 01:36:50,910
Things were stressful thing.
So I've done it over the years,

2300
01:36:50,911 --> 01:36:53,610
hosting shows and things like this in 
front of the audience,

2301
01:36:53,611 --> 01:36:56,070
but not having the act.
Rob was doing it.

2302
01:36:56,370 --> 01:36:59,910
He was going around jumping up at clubs 
around town,

2303
01:36:59,911 --> 01:37:04,230
at the Ice House in Pasadena and to the 
belly room at the comedy store.

2304
01:37:04,231 --> 01:37:05,150
And,
and,

2305
01:37:05,151 --> 01:37:10,151
uh,
we just kind of going around and trying 

2306
01:37:10,151 --> 01:37:10,720
out stuff and it sort of instantly was,
you know,

2307
01:37:10,830 --> 01:37:14,570
instantly was something that I 
immediately was kind of.

2308
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,690
I thought Jesus,
you know,

2309
01:37:16,710 --> 01:37:19,740
why did I not start doing this sooner?
This is just such a great thing.

2310
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:24,880
You know,
part of it also is I've been living in 

2311
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:25,290
La for 10 years.
I got this web studio in my house,

2312
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:26,670
you know,
Kinda thinking,

2313
01:37:26,671 --> 01:37:27,510
you know,
you know,

2314
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:29,880
I got to get out of the house sometime 
here in la.

2315
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:34,910
I need something social to do that's not
going to sit in some loud nightclub 

2316
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:35,670
drinking with people.
You know,

2317
01:37:35,671 --> 01:37:36,450
what,
Hey,

2318
01:37:36,451 --> 01:37:38,760
this is something that really kind of 
wrap my hands around.

2319
01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:41,010
I also was missing getting up in front 
of an audience,

2320
01:37:41,011 --> 01:37:42,120
you know,
the radio,

2321
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:44,790
the web show is in the living room so 
you don't have the audience.

2322
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:46,420
So it's just been,
it's been an amazing time.

2323
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:47,610
And,
and uh,

2324
01:37:47,611 --> 01:37:52,611
you know,
basically did it for about six months 

2325
01:37:52,611 --> 01:37:52,611
and in La just jumping up and writing,
writing,

2326
01:37:52,611 --> 01:37:52,611
writing,
writing,

2327
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,680
lots of stuff.
And uh,

2328
01:37:54,681 --> 01:37:55,680
I've,
I've off,

2329
01:37:55,681 --> 01:37:56,000
I've been here,

2330
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,870
I've got to go to Australia for the 
first time,

2331
01:37:57,990 --> 01:38:01,020
but you're doing like an hour onstage 
and it went down.

2332
01:38:01,021 --> 01:38:04,640
Is Very few people have ever gone from,
I don't do standup too.

2333
01:38:04,641 --> 01:38:07,770
I'm headlining on the road performing on
stage for an hour.

2334
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:12,830
That's a pretty incredible.
When you used to have to actually go 

2335
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:12,830
about an hour and 15 when you used to do
stand up,

2336
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:14,610
how long did you used to do like you 
used to do a long,

2337
01:38:14,611 --> 01:38:15,000
long,
long,

2338
01:38:15,001 --> 01:38:16,770
long time ago.
But no one.

2339
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:19,510
I was thinking I was like do you know 
at,

2340
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,120
at,
at,

2341
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,230
at its peak,
about 15 minutes.

2342
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:23,580
Fifteen minutes.
Middle,

2343
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:26,370
middle end.
But it was five to seven minutes opening

2344
01:38:26,371 --> 01:38:28,350
act and amateur night at first.
You know.

2345
01:38:28,351 --> 01:38:29,520
Tell me how you,
how,

2346
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:31,530
how you concocted this tour.
I mean,

2347
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:36,531
how many,
how long have you been doing standup 

2348
01:38:36,531 --> 01:38:36,531
before you said,
all right,

2349
01:38:36,531 --> 01:38:36,531
I'm going to take this to the road now.

2350
01:38:36,531 --> 01:38:40,580
Basically what happened was I was 
jumping up all around town and the Norm 

2351
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:44,270
Mcdonald asked me to open up from one 
night and do some shows with him one 

2352
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:44,310
night just to kind of get,
you know,

2353
01:38:44,370 --> 01:38:45,480
keep practicing.
And then,

2354
01:38:45,481 --> 01:38:47,520
uh,
and uh,

2355
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,590
essentially,
um,

2356
01:38:49,870 --> 01:38:54,870
I and Sarah [inaudible] from [inaudible]
who came to all my shows and said,

2357
01:38:55,381 --> 01:38:57,030
you know what,
I'm going to book you on a tour.

2358
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:57,990
And I said,
well,

2359
01:38:57,991 --> 01:38:59,070
that's pretty cool.
And she now.

2360
01:38:59,071 --> 01:39:00,570
Okay.
How many months is this into your stent?

2361
01:39:00,650 --> 01:39:04,590
I've been nine months on the road and 
she's been between the time you got back

2362
01:39:04,591 --> 01:39:06,720
on stage at the time you started.
How long was that?

2363
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:11,810
Uh,
this was probably about six months or 

2364
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:11,810
something like that.
Crazy.

2365
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:14,700
So you very much with the intention of I
want to go on the road.

2366
01:39:14,701 --> 01:39:19,701
And it's very impressive that you were 
able to put together over an hour of 

2367
01:39:19,701 --> 01:39:20,040
material in six months.

2368
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,570
That's amazing,
isn't it?

2369
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:26,600
You know,
I thought I was doing the same jokes 

2370
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,251
again last night.
You're developing new shit out of 

2371
01:39:28,251 --> 01:39:31,731
nowhere.
And my friend Mike Young did some shit 

2372
01:39:31,731 --> 01:39:31,731
that he did nine years ago last night.
You know,

2373
01:39:31,731 --> 01:39:35,550
I approached it from a really kind of 
the way I approach doing my television 

2374
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:35,550
show or my web show very from very like 
I would,

2375
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:40,530
I would,
I would be writing all the time and 

2376
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:40,770
trying to build up the diligence,
jumping up to and stuff.

2377
01:39:41,790 --> 01:39:43,900
I organized it all out in paper and how 
he.

2378
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:44,750
Is that what you're doing?
Yeah.

2379
01:39:44,751 --> 01:39:46,080
I just don't know.
I just,

2380
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,450
you know,
for the first,

2381
01:39:48,451 --> 01:39:53,451
for the first,
for the first few months of doing our 

2382
01:39:53,451 --> 01:39:53,451
set,
I had a,

2383
01:39:53,451 --> 01:39:55,890
I had a set list.
I actually took on stage with me and I'd

2384
01:39:55,891 --> 01:39:57,640
set it on the,
on the stool,

2385
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,650
so my water on it.

2386
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:00,990
I do my bits and then I'd,
if I've got lost,

2387
01:40:00,991 --> 01:40:02,420
I'd look down.
That's a good move.

2388
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:04,650
You know Doug Benson brings a notes on 
stage and goes,

2389
01:40:04,651 --> 01:40:09,651
look,
you don't want me to be stumbled around 

2390
01:40:09,651 --> 01:40:09,651
wondering what the fuck I'm talking 
about.

2391
01:40:09,651 --> 01:40:10,020
This is good.
But eventually after,

2392
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:15,750
after awhile though,
I was feeling like it was kind of a bit 

2393
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:15,930
of a crutch because I like to.
I'm trying to be really physical.

2394
01:40:15,931 --> 01:40:18,060
You don't have to use it,
you know the thing.

2395
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:18,730
The thing about it.
No,

2396
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,150
I don't use no notes,
but the thing about notes,

2397
01:40:21,170 --> 01:40:22,880
the good thing is that they're,
you know,

2398
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:23,940
if you need them,
they're there.

2399
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:25,620
You know?
It's like why not have it there?

2400
01:40:25,690 --> 01:40:26,860
Yeah.
No,

2401
01:40:26,990 --> 01:40:28,800
there's sometimes you're like,
I want to hear.

2402
01:40:28,801 --> 01:40:31,140
Like Joey Diaz will say,
what the fuck was I talking about?

2403
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:32,510
What the fuck was I talking about?
Right.

2404
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:33,930
Oh,
that's it.

2405
01:40:33,931 --> 01:40:38,931
And you tell him and then he's got the 
story and it would just run and ramble 

2406
01:40:38,931 --> 01:40:38,931
on to the story.
Sometimes you just need a little note.

2407
01:40:38,931 --> 01:40:43,610
Yeah.
I think I might start putting new stuff 

2408
01:40:43,610 --> 01:40:47,090
that I've never done before on notes and
pulling that out at some point or 

2409
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:47,670
setting.
There's something I can remember.

2410
01:40:47,671 --> 01:40:50,220
All this stuff I've done for once.
I've done it three or four times,

2411
01:40:50,221 --> 01:40:52,100
I can remember it,
but usually I can't remember it.

2412
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:54,220
There's something about writing things 
down on paper that's really

2413
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:59,220
good for your memory to actually the act
of creating a note makes it solidify in 

2414
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:02,710
your mind and when you use your memory,
you can recall like what you wrote,

2415
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:07,750
like you could see it in the order.
I just have a set list of just your 

2416
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:07,750
basic cool.
The iphone thing.

2417
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:09,070
Setlist is cool.
That's definitely better than nothing,

2418
01:41:09,071 --> 01:41:12,730
but I think writing something down on 
paper seems to have the most effect.

2419
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:14,880
It seems to be sticks better.
Yeah.

2420
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:17,230
So do you,
when you wrote out your act,

2421
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:20,350
did you write out a ver,
a beginning,

2422
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:25,470
a middle and an end?
Did you put it all together verbatim or 

2423
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:25,540
do you ad Lib when you're on stage?

2424
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:26,240
Uh,
yeah.

2425
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:30,080
Initially I sort of a yeah,
I ad Lib a lot on stage,

2426
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:35,110
but I have this sort of pretty solid 
began like I know where I'm nowhere I'm 

2427
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:35,150
going to start.
I know I'm going to do when I start,

2428
01:41:35,151 --> 01:41:40,151
I know when I'm going to do,
when I'm finished actually pretty much 

2429
01:41:40,151 --> 01:41:42,521
know the order I'm going to go in 
through the bits that I've tried and 

2430
01:41:42,521 --> 01:41:45,290
tested and then uh,
but then often I'll kind of go off into 

2431
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:49,241
the audience between bits for a second 
and talk to some people for a second.

2432
01:41:49,371 --> 01:41:50,540
And,
but uh,

2433
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:53,270
but what's happened is it sort of 
evolved over the year,

2434
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:57,260
like last nine months of doing it is 
every week I'll kind of go,

2435
01:41:57,261 --> 01:42:00,890
you know,
maybe this is a little too depressing,

2436
01:42:00,891 --> 01:42:03,680
have a subject matter to talk off the 
top.

2437
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,410
So then I'll move it sort of later in 
the act.

2438
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:09,290
And then it's kind of a,
it's been fun.

2439
01:42:09,291 --> 01:42:11,000
It's been really fun and challenging,
you know,

2440
01:42:11,001 --> 01:42:14,930
doing it and a sort of shuffling things 
around all the time.

2441
01:42:14,931 --> 01:42:19,931
And so it's,
it's been cool and I write bits down in 

2442
01:42:19,931 --> 01:42:19,931
my phone,
in my notepad,

2443
01:42:19,931 --> 01:42:24,460
in my phone if I think something weird 
and then I'll go home and I'll type it 

2444
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:25,790
up in the computer.
And so do you type it up as a joke or do

2445
01:42:25,791 --> 01:42:27,650
you type up bullet points,
like what do you do?

2446
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:33,220
I usually write it out word for word 
with punchlines and exactly how I'm 

2447
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:37,181
going to say it and then I edit it and I
get it exactly what I want to be and 

2448
01:42:37,181 --> 01:42:40,991
then you know,
and then I try to sort of remember it 

2449
01:42:40,991 --> 01:42:41,540
and then usually the first time I say it
on stage,

2450
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:45,690
I forget about half of the taglines,
forget about half of them and then I,

2451
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:48,710
but I say it but then I get off the 
stage and I immediately remember,

2452
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:50,600
Oh,
I forgot that,

2453
01:42:50,601 --> 01:42:50,990
that,
that.

2454
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:56,080
And I think the disappointment of 
forgetting them makes it easier to 

2455
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:56,080
remember the next time because then I go
look at them again.

2456
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,980
I go,
got to remember this tag line,

2457
01:42:57,981 --> 01:42:59,360
this line.
And so it's sort of,

2458
01:42:59,390 --> 01:43:01,250
it's interesting.
It is interesting because you really,

2459
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:02,890
it really is kind of cool,
you know,

2460
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:06,020
I mean again this first year of doing 
this full time night after night,

2461
01:43:06,021 --> 01:43:08,450
but to see what people tell you,
no,

2462
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:09,890
you got to get up.
It's like a muscle,

2463
01:43:09,891 --> 01:43:12,850
you get up on stage,
you start to pertain it differently and,

2464
01:43:13,070 --> 01:43:14,150
and you know,
you know,

2465
01:43:14,151 --> 01:43:19,151
there's been obviously periods for two,
three weeks where I haven't done a show 

2466
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:19,151
this year and then,
you know,

2467
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:19,930
you get back on,
it's weird.

2468
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,090
You can't remember anything

2469
01:43:21,650 --> 01:43:24,080
cool a week or two off all the time and 
want to come back on stage.

2470
01:43:24,081 --> 01:43:25,520
I'm like,
I always have to do a warmup set.

2471
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:30,820
I'd do something in town in La and then 
it charges it and then that's the only 

2472
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:34,331
time.
Well that's the time where I'll go over 

2473
01:43:34,331 --> 01:43:36,101
material just to familiarize myself with
what I've been talking about most 

2474
01:43:36,101 --> 01:43:39,701
recently.
So I have like my iphone records all my 

2475
01:43:39,701 --> 01:43:39,701
sense and I get recordings from Brian 
too.

2476
01:43:39,701 --> 01:43:42,830
So then I take them and I put them on my
ipod and I just listened to my plans.

2477
01:43:43,010 --> 01:43:44,480
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2478
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:49,540
So it makes you dissect your shit also 
unconfident audio record and be better 

2479
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:49,650
than what you're listening to.
You know,

2480
01:43:49,651 --> 01:43:51,950
you want to tighten it up and this,
that Oh yeah.

2481
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:57,010
That's cool.
And you're not hearing it for the first 

2482
01:43:57,010 --> 01:43:57,010
time.
You're hearing it for the 400th time and

2483
01:43:57,010 --> 01:43:57,490
it's,
you know,

2484
01:43:57,491 --> 01:43:58,580
you really start breaking shit.

2485
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:00,740
So you recorded in an ipod or

2486
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:03,840
sometimes I'm the iphone.
Sometimes I feel from him.

2487
01:44:03,841 --> 01:44:04,110
He

2488
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:05,530
plugs up.
Oh yeah.

2489
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:08,620
Good idea.
That's helpful because then you can hear

2490
01:44:08,621 --> 01:44:10,710
the little things that you say.
So you're enjoying it,

2491
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,310
man.
You're enjoying this whole process.

2492
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,240
So yeah,
it's been really,

2493
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:14,230
really fun.
And you know,

2494
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:19,240
I like what we were talking about when,
when we were having coffee when I got 

2495
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:19,800
here in the kitchen,
you know,

2496
01:44:19,810 --> 01:44:24,810
we're talking about,
you were talking about how it's just 

2497
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:24,810
nice to be in an independent thing where
you know,

2498
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:29,680
you want to come up with a crazy idea 
and it was a funny thought and you go up

2499
01:44:29,681 --> 01:44:31,750
and you can try it and there's no,
you know,

2500
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:34,720
somebody coming in and telling you not 
to say this or do that.

2501
01:44:34,770 --> 01:44:35,260
That's it.

2502
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:37,280
That's the most frustrating thing for 
anybody.

2503
01:44:37,281 --> 01:44:42,281
Controversial.
Like you is got to be a bunch of 

2504
01:44:42,281 --> 01:44:42,740
executives that have their ideas about 
what they think is going to be funny and

2505
01:44:42,741 --> 01:44:44,100
they're imposing it and you're like,
look,

2506
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:49,120
it may not be funny for you.
It might not be funny for three people 

2507
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:49,120
in this room,
but for people in this room,

2508
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:53,861
I think it's the funny shit they've ever
seen and you're going for those four 

2509
01:44:53,861 --> 01:44:54,710
people and these people can never see 
that.

2510
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:57,260
All they can see is,
but you're losing three.

2511
01:44:57,610 --> 01:45:02,610
You just took this back.
This person would still like it yet 

2512
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:03,410
still get the original people and we'd 
have two more people that like it.

2513
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:04,790
Yeah.
That's how they think.

2514
01:45:04,791 --> 01:45:07,220
They think in these nutty numbers and 
they're not thinking creative

2515
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:12,220
and then you end up spending most of 
your time dealing with that and at the 

2516
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:12,220
end,
at the end of it all,

2517
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:17,111
you're never really sure what it would 
have been if you'd just sort of gone 

2518
01:45:17,111 --> 01:45:17,111
wild on your own.
Beautiful,

2519
01:45:17,111 --> 01:45:19,190
great freedom and just being on the road
has been really fun.

2520
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:21,440
It's been really fun.
It's been a good way.

2521
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:26,590
I also thought it'd be cool way to go 
out and film stuff for my website 

2522
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:26,600
because I always wanted to.
I've always said,

2523
01:45:26,601 --> 01:45:28,730
hey,
it'd be cool to take my web show,

2524
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:34,320
you know,
and go to different cities and see the 

2525
01:45:34,611 --> 01:45:35,810
people that watched the web show,
you know,

2526
01:45:35,811 --> 01:45:38,120
people call in on Tom Green.com,
you know,

2527
01:45:38,121 --> 01:45:39,440
they call it on skype.
I know.

2528
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:41,840
Recognize every show I go to.
It's so bizarre.

2529
01:45:41,841 --> 01:45:43,130
You know,
every show I go to,

2530
01:45:43,131 --> 01:45:45,860
I recognize 10 people saying,
Hey John,

2531
01:45:45,861 --> 01:45:46,430
how you doing?

2532
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:48,710
You know,
I've never been to the city before,

2533
01:45:48,711 --> 01:45:49,250
you know,
and it's like,

2534
01:45:49,251 --> 01:45:51,290
hey,
we gotta set up skype.

2535
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:53,760
Dude,
we've got four Chan.

2536
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,180
You scared of fortune?
Yeah.

2537
01:45:56,270 --> 01:45:57,680
Don't be scared.
Oh yeah,

2538
01:45:57,681 --> 01:45:58,430
that's fine.
That's fine.

2539
01:45:58,431 --> 01:46:03,431
That's just somebody to fuck with you.
Scared of them.

2540
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,410
She never admitted.
I fucked up.

2541
01:46:06,411 --> 01:46:08,320
I'm not scared of you already fucked up.
You already.

2542
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:09,550
Fuck.
I wanted to join them.

2543
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:12,980
Now we're talking about,
you know,

2544
01:46:12,981 --> 01:46:14,100
the thing is,
is with the.

2545
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:19,680
I mean to give you a little bit of a,
of an idea here.

2546
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,010
Okay.
So what we've done in my eyesight,

2547
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:24,140
because four Chan was,
was I,

2548
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:29,190
I found,
did some fairly clever and ridiculous 

2549
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:32,531
and absurd prank calls on us constantly.
They are completely irrelevant and 

2550
01:46:33,591 --> 01:46:36,080
obviously the most annoying thing 
because it's completely irrelevant.

2551
01:46:36,081 --> 01:46:38,170
I'm sitting here with guests,
right?

2552
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:39,320
So.
But that was on the phone,

2553
01:46:39,321 --> 01:46:44,321
but on skype it's a,
it's a much more difficult for them to 

2554
01:46:44,321 --> 01:46:47,081
do that because we've created a system 
which I'll tell you about off air 

2555
01:46:47,081 --> 01:46:47,500
actually.
I'll tell you about off air.

2556
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:50,010
Off Air.
So I motherfuckers you aint

2557
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:53,100
getting to stay one step ahead.
Step ahead of the four Chan guys,

2558
01:46:53,110 --> 01:46:58,110
bell all system for skype that you can 
actually use that will help help in that

2559
01:46:58,741 --> 01:47:02,130
area for Chan.
Don't do it.

2560
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:07,500
Fucked up.
You heard everybody's ears and you 

2561
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:07,500
pissed a bunch of people off.
They're coming after you now dude.

2562
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:09,540
Fucked up.
So we went after that bitch that through

2563
01:47:09,541 --> 01:47:11,120
puppies in the river.
They got her.

2564
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:13,680
Was that loud for Cenk?
Got that.

2565
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:15,230
It was all right.
Just a little annoyance.

2566
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,270
Um.
Well Tom Bring.

2567
01:47:17,271 --> 01:47:19,010
I'm losing my hearing because of stuff 
like that too.

2568
01:47:19,090 --> 01:47:21,320
Did you want me to.
I think I'm starting to lose my hearing.

2569
01:47:21,321 --> 01:47:26,321
I have noticed a lot of times I'm in 
conversations with people and they're 

2570
01:47:26,321 --> 01:47:27,760
talking to me as if I should be able to 
hear what they're saying the same.

2571
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:31,200
Same with me and I'm like thinking maybe
I'm just not paying attention to them,

2572
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:32,710
but I can't hear them.
Call it.

2573
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:36,240
Having your years blown out from people,
is that what it is or is it just a bunch

2574
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:38,680
of people that are talking all soft 
talk,

2575
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:43,700
like a fucking normal person.
Some people just mumbled certain 

2576
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:46,470
frequencies to when people have sort of 
that frequency of noisy area.

2577
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:53,710
Tell me how annoying is that?
What kind of stuff do you talk about?

2578
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:57,420
That is the dumbest question.
I mean,

2579
01:47:57,421 --> 01:48:00,140
I know it's a relevant question,
but for,

2580
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:01,190
for a comic,
what?

2581
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,700
What are you.
What are the things you're talking about

2582
01:48:02,701 --> 01:48:03,810
right now?
Well,

2583
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:06,280
when we tell you,
I think Sarah Pailin is dumb.

2584
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:07,710
Yeah,
let me do the bit right now.

2585
01:48:07,711 --> 01:48:08,820
Which doesn't really.
You know,

2586
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:14,330
killer whales are smart.
You shouldn't be in pools are going to 

2587
01:48:14,330 --> 01:48:16,650
run out.
You have a lot of Ufo stuff going on,

2588
01:48:16,651 --> 01:48:21,651
Huh?
It wasn't there and I go into a little 

2589
01:48:21,651 --> 01:48:21,651
UFO,
but somebody.

2590
01:48:21,651 --> 01:48:22,500
Exactly what you're talking.
Because I think that people,

2591
01:48:22,501 --> 01:48:27,501
when they ask that question,
you don't understand how important the 

2592
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:28,380
audiences when you're telling these 
things,

2593
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:31,190
it's so much part of it.
So you know,

2594
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:34,370
you need the audience there.
That's cool.

2595
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:38,250
So wait Ufo thing,
if you have you been paying attention to

2596
01:48:38,251 --> 01:48:38,790
what's going on?

2597
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:43,850
That's something that an appointed a 
liaison or a spokesperson for the 

2598
01:48:43,981 --> 01:48:48,981
American for,
for the human race rather in 

2599
01:48:48,981 --> 01:48:48,981
communication.
When aliens land.

2600
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:52,830
Really it's some weird looking chick.
She was like very like,

2601
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:58,120
it's not Sarah Pale man looking.
She's the person that they're not to.

2602
01:48:58,380 --> 01:48:59,850
Don't get me wrong.
She's a strange looking.

2603
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:01,260
She's the person that we're going to 
talk to.

2604
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:04,290
She's speaking for you.
Shouldn't we have some sort of insight?

2605
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:09,580
Fuck the UN over the world.
I don't know what the pucker just like.

2606
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:11,820
Is that like just like,
oh,

2607
01:49:11,821 --> 01:49:13,690
and if we ever get attacked by aliens,
you have.

2608
01:49:13,691 --> 01:49:14,730
They did this.
Maybe.

2609
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:17,540
Maybe like a resident firefighter.
Maybe.

2610
01:49:17,541 --> 01:49:19,210
It's just like that's the most basic 
part.

2611
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:22,170
I hope so because you imagine that's a 
fulltime job.

2612
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:24,830
Can you imagine if she gets like 100 
grand a year in benefits and all she has

2613
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:26,200
to just sit around and wait for the 
answer.

2614
01:49:26,210 --> 01:49:28,890
Call feet up.
Reading US magazine.

2615
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:31,170
Yeah.
Keep up to date and what's important?

2616
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:37,420
Who the fuck it looked?
The aliens don't give a fuck about who 

2617
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:37,420
the leader is.
They don't give a shit.

2618
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:39,450
If they were going to come here from 
another galaxy.

2619
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:41,250
They're the leader.
There is no leader.

2620
01:49:41,251 --> 01:49:43,740
You don't get to represent like the 
aliens don't care.

2621
01:49:43,741 --> 01:49:46,080
What's the fucking number one aunt you 
know?

2622
01:49:46,110 --> 01:49:48,010
Do you ever look at who's the one aunt 
before I kill

2623
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,940
all you people.
He just killed all the answers.

2624
01:49:50,150 --> 01:49:51,460
There's no discussion.
Yeah.

2625
01:49:51,490 --> 01:49:53,560
You don't to have communication with 
ants over.

2626
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:56,110
You know who's going to die and whether 
or not you guys can move out.

2627
01:49:56,111 --> 01:50:01,111
No.
You just killed them all and if that's 

2628
01:50:01,111 --> 01:50:02,881
what aliens decide to do to us,
we'll do the same thing to us that we 

2629
01:50:02,881 --> 01:50:05,551
do.
The monkeys that we do to dolphins that 

2630
01:50:05,551 --> 01:50:05,551
we did a killer whales,
but they treat us well.

2631
01:50:05,551 --> 01:50:07,450
They should be like that monkey that was
holding the kitten the other day.

2632
01:50:07,451 --> 01:50:10,640
They might just come down and cradle us.
It might be the exact opposite.

2633
01:50:10,641 --> 01:50:11,710
They might just be like,
hey,

2634
01:50:11,711 --> 01:50:16,711
we just want to comb your hair and fuzzy
to Baka type creatures that come down.

2635
01:50:16,931 --> 01:50:17,590
Just want to.
It's.

2636
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:21,780
I try to keep these thoughts,
these ideas of Ufo aliens.

2637
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:26,790
I tried to keep him away from my 
consciousness because I think they're 

2638
01:50:26,790 --> 01:50:29,970
giant time-wasters contemplate what if 
the aliens are really these Ufo videos 

2639
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:31,400
real?

2640
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:37,280
I'm open.
I'm open to the possibility that there 

2641
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:37,280
are aliens,
but I'm not gonna.

2642
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:41,070
Sit around and watch some fucking lights
in the sky that I don't know what the 

2643
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:43,891
fuck it is.
It turned out it was actually a 

2644
01:50:43,891 --> 01:50:43,891
helicopter and you're actually retarded,
you know?

2645
01:50:43,891 --> 01:50:44,020
Oh,
you know,

2646
01:50:44,021 --> 01:50:49,021
I mean maybe this is.
It was a prank when those little 

2647
01:50:49,021 --> 01:50:53,611
helicopters that he souped up and has a 
couple leds and I'm not closed to the 

2648
01:50:53,611 --> 01:50:58,351
idea that there are something there that
it is possible that there are some sort 

2649
01:50:58,571 --> 01:51:01,540
of intelligent life forms out there that
are capable of traveling here,

2650
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:03,450
whether they're from another planet or 
another dimension.

2651
01:51:03,550 --> 01:51:08,550
It wouldn't be ridiculous,
but everything about this life would be 

2652
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:08,550
ridiculous.
We weren't living it.

2653
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,860
The idea that we can get the Internet 
would be ridiculous if it didn't exist.

2654
01:51:12,010 --> 01:51:13,930
The idea that you could send pictures 
from your phone,

2655
01:51:13,931 --> 01:51:18,931
the idea that you had to have a phone 
that fits in your pocket and you call 

2656
01:51:18,931 --> 01:51:18,970
someone in China and to talk in real 
time.

2657
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,120
Everything is so small condensed now.
It's so much smaller now.

2658
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:25,060
It's also strange that it's going to 
feel entirely possible.

2659
01:51:25,061 --> 01:51:30,061
There's something super advanced past 
this and they can communicate with us 

2660
01:51:30,061 --> 01:51:30,910
and it's probably could be here right 
now watching us,

2661
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:33,330
but these guys that came out today or 
that you were.

2662
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:37,840
You were talking about last couple days 
that are air force generals,

2663
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:40,510
etc.
That have been sworn to secrecy for last

2664
01:51:40,511 --> 01:51:42,280
50 years or whatever that say that,
uh,

2665
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:45,360
you know,
they came and checked out some nuclear,

2666
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:49,030
um,
our nuclear sites and that they shut off

2667
01:51:49,031 --> 01:51:51,640
some nuclear weapons and they're all 
saying that this happened.

2668
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:55,240
Do you Think that happened?
Or it could be one of two things.

2669
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:56,200
Well,
it can be many things,

2670
01:51:56,230 --> 01:52:01,230
but one of the things that it could be 
that I was thinking is maybe these guys 

2671
01:52:01,230 --> 01:52:04,231
are like being paid by the government to
say absolutely ridiculous things and 

2672
01:52:04,511 --> 01:52:06,460
that nothing ever really happened at 
all.

2673
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:09,800
And what there are is a part of some 
sort of a disinflation campaign and then

2674
01:52:09,801 --> 01:52:14,801
eventually turn out.
They lied about a few details and that 

2675
01:52:14,801 --> 01:52:17,611
will discredit the whole story.
And it just makes aliens seem more and 

2676
01:52:17,611 --> 01:52:21,841
more ridiculous to calm people down 
because maybe there may be some things 

2677
01:52:21,841 --> 01:52:22,510
that they can't keep wraps on.
And when those things are leaked,

2678
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:24,780
the best way to diffuse the impact that 
some,

2679
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:28,840
some sort of a crazy event or video.
The best way to diffuse the impact would

2680
01:52:28,841 --> 01:52:33,841
be to show all these other ones have 
similar stories that seem absolutely 

2681
01:52:33,841 --> 01:52:34,030
ridiculous,
so it automatically gets lumped into,

2682
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:35,350
oh,
it's a ufo video.

2683
01:52:35,351 --> 01:52:36,490
Oh,
you're crazy.

2684
01:52:36,491 --> 01:52:37,600
Oh,
you believe that?

2685
01:52:37,870 --> 01:52:40,030
And so it automatically puts it into 
that category.

2686
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:45,040
I mean,
that's an effective psychological 

2687
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:47,041
tactic.
If you were someone like the cia or 

2688
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:49,651
someone in the nsa,
someone who's of a super intelligence 

2689
01:52:49,651 --> 01:52:52,661
community,
they know how to fucking manipulate 

2690
01:52:52,661 --> 01:52:52,661
people,
don't,

2691
01:52:52,661 --> 01:52:52,661
don't make no mistake about it.
They absolutely do.

2692
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:57,700
So it could be that or it could be that 
these people really saw some shit and 

2693
01:52:57,700 --> 01:52:58,400
they don't even know what the fuck it 
is.

2694
01:52:58,401 --> 01:53:00,780
It could be that you know that they're 
all crazy.

2695
01:53:00,890 --> 01:53:02,330
there's,
there's a bunch of bs,

2696
01:53:02,331 --> 01:53:05,990
but until I see something,
until some shit comes into my life,

2697
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:10,991
I'm just wasting my time.
I just don't want to sit around 

2698
01:53:10,991 --> 01:53:10,991
thinking,
you know,

2699
01:53:10,991 --> 01:53:13,250
whether or not half this shit is real.
And rob [inaudible],

2700
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:14,390
did he really work at area?

2701
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:16,070
Do you want to know that guy?
I saw that guy.

2702
01:53:16,071 --> 01:53:21,071
I've watched all.
I got addicted to watching that stuff 

2703
01:53:21,071 --> 01:53:21,071
for a lot,
for,

2704
01:53:21,071 --> 01:53:24,000
for a good year.
I was addicted to watching all this 

2705
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:24,000
stuff and,
and uh,

2706
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:24,620
and,
and talk to this disclosure,

2707
01:53:24,621 --> 01:53:25,370
you know,
they're gonna get,

2708
01:53:25,371 --> 01:53:27,770
they're gonna tell us soon.
They're just prepping us for it,

2709
01:53:27,771 --> 01:53:29,420
you know,
the disclosure project.

2710
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:31,170
I really do hope that,
uh,

2711
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:33,710
they tell us soon because I think that 
would be pretty cool,

2712
01:53:33,711 --> 01:53:34,100
man.

2713
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:39,220
I think there's a lot of people 
scrambling trying to figure out a bunch 

2714
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:41,921
of different things that don't make 
sense and I think it's very possible 

2715
01:53:41,921 --> 01:53:44,891
that there are some alien life forms,
but I do not think that our government 

2716
01:53:44,891 --> 01:53:46,940
has shit under control enough to keep 
all that shit under wraps and to somehow

2717
01:53:46,941 --> 01:53:48,680
or another be communicating with these 
things.

2718
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:53,830
I think if the government knows anything
about ufo is they know barely more than 

2719
01:53:53,830 --> 01:53:58,180
the average person knows and they have 
some evidence and they keep that shit 

2720
01:53:58,180 --> 01:53:58,370
under wraps with they have cleared up 
some evidence.

2721
01:53:58,371 --> 01:53:59,780
Perhaps.
Maybe if it's true,

2722
01:53:59,930 --> 01:54:02,780
maybe you know,
you hear all the area 51 stories and the

2723
01:54:02,781 --> 01:54:07,781
roswell stories and you know,
the crashes has been recovered all over 

2724
01:54:07,781 --> 01:54:08,060
the country.
There's has been crashes,

2725
01:54:08,061 --> 01:54:10,250
recovered supposedly in Pennsylvania,
in the woods,

2726
01:54:10,251 --> 01:54:12,140
and who knows how much of that shit's 
bullshit.

2727
01:54:12,141 --> 01:54:17,141
Who knows how much of that stuff is just
some sort of a prototype that the us 

2728
01:54:17,141 --> 01:54:17,141
government was working on.

2729
01:54:17,141 --> 01:54:18,410
It didn't work and it crashed.
You know who the fuck knows,

2730
01:54:19,010 --> 01:54:24,010
but I'm open.
I'm open to the possibility that that's 

2731
01:54:24,010 --> 01:54:24,620
just the fact that we exist to ants.
Okay?

2732
01:54:24,710 --> 01:54:26,600
Then that means the way the universe 
works,

2733
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:31,720
things become ever more complicated to 
keep going in the same direction over 

2734
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:34,481
and over again.
If human beings came from emmy buzz and 

2735
01:54:34,481 --> 01:54:34,640
all sudden someday evolve to become 
human beings,

2736
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:35,840
what?
Whatever the fuck.

2737
01:54:35,841 --> 01:54:38,420
We were a single celled organisms that 
we became us.

2738
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:43,010
There's gonna be a similar group of 
evolution from us to something else,

2739
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:48,220
so it literally will be.
The aliens will be treating us the same 

2740
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:49,220
way we treat a fucking ant colony.
Look at these silicons.

2741
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:50,780
I'll get these silly concert,
their pollution.

2742
01:54:50,781 --> 01:54:51,530
They're stupid building.

2743
01:54:51,610 --> 01:54:56,610
See,
I'm hoping what it is is these ships 

2744
01:54:56,610 --> 01:54:56,610
that come,
right?

2745
01:54:56,610 --> 01:54:59,221
They come and they start talking to us 
and then eventually it started to open 

2746
01:54:59,221 --> 01:54:59,221
up and they come on,
they look exactly like us,

2747
01:54:59,221 --> 01:55:01,100
right?
They look exactly like us and what it is

2748
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:02,680
we've spent.
We've spread.

2749
01:55:02,681 --> 01:55:04,280
Maybe we've got,
maybe they got like and know.

2750
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:05,110
We're like ants,
right?

2751
01:55:05,111 --> 01:55:07,270
They got similar.
What's so great about us?

2752
01:55:07,330 --> 01:55:12,330
So then we get in this thing and you get
to go to another planet instantly with 

2753
01:55:12,330 --> 01:55:12,970
our technology and it's got more space.
It's not all.

2754
01:55:12,971 --> 01:55:14,760
There's no pollution and they've,
you know,

2755
01:55:14,990 --> 01:55:17,150
sorta like that.
That's what I'm kinda hoping for.

2756
01:55:17,151 --> 01:55:19,570
And that's why I'm kind of angling for.
I'm hoping for that.

2757
01:55:19,630 --> 01:55:21,310
You want utopia.
That's beautiful.

2758
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:23,620
You should write a book saying that you 
know,

2759
01:55:23,621 --> 01:55:25,030
it's true.
You don't start a call.

2760
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:27,340
Yeah.
And then drink a bunch of grape kool aid

2761
01:55:27,341 --> 01:55:30,870
and they have to go crazy.
That was an africa,

2762
01:55:30,871 --> 01:55:32,070
isn't it?
Uh,

2763
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:35,330
it was a diana.
Yeah.

2764
01:55:35,910 --> 01:55:39,190
Was it cool to diana tragedy?
Jon jones?

2765
01:55:39,310 --> 01:55:40,480
It's ncd amazing,
isn't it?

2766
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:42,250
That self american radio was south 
America,

2767
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:44,250
Guyana,
south Guyana

2768
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:45,890
in south America.
As you heard the audio,

2769
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:48,550
are you fucking crazy?
Scary,

2770
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:51,180
so scary.
If you don't know the story of jim jones

2771
01:55:51,181 --> 01:55:54,620
was a cult leader,
moved all of his people to Guyana,

2772
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:56,250
wherever that is.
I thought it was africa,

2773
01:55:56,580 --> 01:55:58,930
sounds african and they all drank,
drank.

2774
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:01,300
He made them all poison themselves and 
then they shot a bunch of people to.

2775
01:56:01,301 --> 01:56:06,301
We didn't want to take the poison 
congressmen flew down there to see them 

2776
01:56:06,301 --> 01:56:06,301
and uh,
you know,

2777
01:56:06,301 --> 01:56:09,180
the way they poisoned them was they put 
the cyanide in grape kool aid and that's

2778
01:56:09,181 --> 01:56:09,840
why they,
they,

2779
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:12,030
they say don't drink,
don't drink the koolaid.

2780
01:56:12,031 --> 01:56:13,800
That's where that saying comes from.
Yeah.

2781
01:56:13,801 --> 01:56:14,810
And that's the,
you know,

2782
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:18,780
the pretty major it.
It resulted in a saying cultural.

2783
01:56:18,781 --> 01:56:20,430
Yeah.
Cultural tag.

2784
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:24,630
Don't treat pissed about that to you.
Why would they,

2785
01:56:24,631 --> 01:56:26,550
when they're so delicious,
they worry.

2786
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:31,730
Why would truly give a fuck?
Because they're connected to a mass 

2787
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:34,170
murder for a long time.
I wonder how we should research,

2788
01:56:34,171 --> 01:56:37,940
find out what their sales were up or 
down.

2789
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,050
That's probably why hawaiian punch was 
born.

2790
01:56:40,830 --> 01:56:43,680
Probably came out after that.
They changed their name.

2791
01:56:44,090 --> 01:56:47,340
You might be rankeD top green.
I think that's a good note to end it on.

2792
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:50,340
Absolutely.
This has been awesome.

2793
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:52,200
Is a lot of fun.
We've been on for like a couple of hours

2794
01:56:52,201 --> 01:56:53,130
or something.
Two hours.

2795
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:55,320
That's amazing.
Let's go because we get to go into depth

2796
01:56:55,321 --> 01:56:56,280
about subjects,
you know?

2797
01:56:56,490 --> 01:56:58,560
I find that like when we were doing an 
hour,

2798
01:56:58,561 --> 01:56:59,880
we would just start talking about 
things.

2799
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,560
Then all of a sudden we'd run out of 
time and I'm like,

2800
01:57:01,561 --> 01:57:06,561
why can't we just keep going?
I love what you said that when I was on 

2801
01:57:06,561 --> 01:57:06,561
your show,
it was just so much fun.

2802
01:57:06,561 --> 01:57:07,650
It's like it seems like it'd be more fun
if we got to keep going.

2803
01:57:07,651 --> 01:57:10,920
It's just to get into a really time.
Really.

2804
01:57:10,921 --> 01:57:11,910
Cool.
Thank you very much.

2805
01:57:11,911 --> 01:57:12,860
Very much for doing it,
man.

2806
01:57:12,890 --> 01:57:17,890
I appreciate you coming by and it's so 
awesome that I can just run into brian 

2807
01:57:17,890 --> 01:57:20,280
and I'd love to have you come back and 
do the webinar vision deficit soon.com

2808
01:57:20,281 --> 01:57:22,860
and run into each other at a comedy club
and then all of a sudden,

2809
01:57:22,861 --> 01:57:23,580
boom,
you know,

2810
01:57:23,581 --> 01:57:24,920
we're.
We're hanging out in pocket.

2811
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:26,480
That show that you did is actually on 
time.

2812
01:57:26,481 --> 01:57:27,210

twitter at tom green live and tom green 

2814

if you,
if you haven't seen his show,

2815
01:57:33,841 --> 01:57:35,880
he has a whole web.
We were talking about the show.

2816
01:57:36,230 --> 01:57:39,540
He and I did his whole like literally 
like a tonight show on the internet.

2817
01:57:40,050 --> 01:57:43,290
It's a brilliant thing and I loved it 
and it inspired me to do this.

2818
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:48,620
This was the first thought in my mind of
putting something together on the 

2819
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:48,900
internet.
You get my tour dates on there.
