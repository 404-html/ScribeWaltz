1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,830
Can we go
for three to

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,620
boom and we're live. Hello,
Miriam. Hi Joe. Good to see you.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,860
Grab this mic and keep it
like a fist from your face.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,960
That's a good reference
point. Perfect. Perfect.

5
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:22,860
Just like that. Yeah. Good
to see you. Good to see him.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,160
I'm sad that you can't sell these
snacks everywhere because I know you're,

7
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:29,520
you're working on making these
mass produced, but they're
fucking fantastic. Yeah,

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,970
they're very good.
When did you first give me some of these?

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,960
Like five years ago or some shit.
Something like that. Yeah, yeah,

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,220
yeah, yeah. My knee blew out.

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,940
I just had surgery and I needed something
to do. So that was neat. Number one.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,250
The second one, that was the second one.
And that was, and I've had two more sense.

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,330
I've had four total.
The life of a world champion.

14
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:58,310
Moyie Thai kickboxer not an easy one.
Actually started when I started,

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,160
we started at grappling. That's when it
started blowing your out. Yeah, yeah. No,

16
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:05,790
it was, I was, um, wait, time was
fine. It got cracked ribs. I got cut.

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,610
I got maybe concussions may be really
bad. Like broke my elbow on. Somebody had.

18
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,600
Yeah, but not, no, I'm
nice stuff. It was the MMA,

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,220
Jujitsu, wrestling and
Jujitsu. A rough on the knees.

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,050
This motion not awesome on the cartilage.
It's like a weird emotion.

21
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,450
You mean I'm like hip,
stuff like that with your,

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,020
so like a on your back or working
in guard, that kind of thing.

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,390
That's where you think that
it, well, I just, yeah,

24
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,490
and 20 years of use on this body.
Yeah.

25
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,470
Well it does put it put, it puts
weight in weird ways. He's too,

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,750
if someone's trying to pass your guard
and they're moving your ankles. Yeah.

27
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,700
Just swivel with their weight and
their violence directed at you. Yeah.

28
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,370
I saw you getting a bunch of fluid
on Instagram shot into there.

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,800
What is that all about? Like
Orthovisc what has that not help? No,

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,620
that was a waste of money. That
was, yeah, it was the Gulf,

31
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,200
like a gooey fluid padding. Oh, is
that what the idea is? But what was,

32
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,880
what was really nice as I got a straight
shot of Ibuprofen in there that felt

33
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:18,630
amazing. Like three months worth of
Ibuprofen. Just shot it right in there.

34
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,360
That shit is so bad for you
though. Is that it was, well
it felt really good. Yeah.

35
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,450
I tell everybody stay the fuck
away from my Ibuprofen. Yeah.

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,520
Doctor Rhonda Patrick is the first
person that alerted me to it.

37
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,320
The increased Reese of a risk of
strokes and heart attack. And then,

38
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:38,520
um, my friend Cam Haynes, who's
an ultra marathon runner, he um,

39
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,560
he was taking 800 milligrams a day every
day for how long? Forever. That's a lot.

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,250
It's a lot. That's different. It is
different. I just got one super shot.

41
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,390
Well he was wrong. He basically
runs almost a marathon a
day. Yeah, that's crazy.

42
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah. Cause he runs, he's 240 mile races.

43
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,530
So he was having these series paints
like he's like, I need it to get going.

44
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,990
So I told him about all the heart attack
stuff and the stroke stuff. He's like,

45
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:03,490
fuck.
So he gets off of it,

46
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,450
all of his inflammation
relaxes and calms down.

47
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,570
Turns out what was going on
was the Ibuprofen severely
upsets your gut bacteria.

48
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,370
And so when that happens,
it causes systemic inflammation,

49
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:23,360
which you then treat with Ibuprofen.
So he takes out the Ibuprofen, all the,

50
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:28,300
the gut problems go away. All the
inflammation goes away, all his hip pains,

51
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,180
knee pains, all that shit
went away, which is crazy.

52
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,350
I think Ibuprofen is great
if you do it every week,

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,150
just rarely, you know
something's going on. You need,

54
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,330
what I noticed when he shot my knee that
into my knee and meet like within the

55
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,011
next week,
you know,

56
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:51,160
over the course of a couple
of days I noticed that I
had greater range of motion.

57
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,900
So what it made me
realize, it was like, oh,

58
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,540
I had a little inflammation in there
cause I was kept thinking. It was like,

59
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,390
is it, is it the tissue tight? Is
this homeboy shooting the wounded?

60
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,730
What does he shoot it in here?
This is,

61
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,970
this is that stuff that
didn't have gloves on? Yeah,

62
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,250
it was have gloves on.
Fucking doctors. This,

63
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,730
where were you in a garage
somewhere? Free Clinic. Would it?

64
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,830
Oh Yo,
look at you.

65
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,550
So what does that Orthovisc
stuff supposed to do?

66
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,680
Like give it padding. Yeah.
It didn't really help.

67
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,320
It was a waste of money and time.
How much does that Shit Cross?

68
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,920
I think it was like 200 or two 20 I
shot and I just got three of them.

69
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,940
Well maybe it's for like regular people,
maybe it would work for regular people,

70
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:41,770
not for people to throw
him a lot of kicks.

71
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,810
You know the kicks don't bother me
and I bet it is the kicks. Right. I,

72
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:48,640
I think I think about that
like it is grappling, right?

73
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:51,910
That is the thing that puts the most
where on your, if you talk like you,

74
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:55,990
you meet like old kickboxers. I mean
some of them have brain damage for sure,

75
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,410
but their bodies aren't as
broken down as old. Grapplers no,

76
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:02,710
they might be humbling a little bit.
Know their toes, might kind of using rob.

77
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,060
Rob came in of him.
Rob Is Rob Rob's foot look,

78
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,010
look like he jumped into a pool that
was empty land and on his big toe.

79
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,980
Yeah,
all of them.

80
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,070
But when you're a guy like rob has been
kicking shins and elbows for so long,

81
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,760
he's amazing.
It sucks.

82
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:29,210
It hurts my heart that he missed the, um,
the, the current human said, you know,

83
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,970
the fame wave cause he's brilliant.
He's fucking brilliant.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,080
He really is. Yeah. And he helped a lot
of fighters too. I mean he was a big,

85
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,470
big part of Br Brennan
Vera's early success and uh,

86
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,740
that's when I was training with them
bomb squad days. Yep. And you know,

87
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,830
he was working with a lot of kickboxers
and even people were starting to catch

88
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:55,600
onto his whole system, but I didn't
even when I got to work with him, um,

89
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,250
and I couldn't at the time

90
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,950
I was so,
um,

91
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,040
green as a fighter or just as a martial
artist that I couldn't comprehend what

92
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,650
he was trying to show me and
tell me. And he's like, no,

93
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,780
you're going to have programs,
counters to the counters.

94
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,620
And he was like trying to dial in me and
programming and I couldn't keep up with

95
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:16,460
him, you know, at the time it was
just too, and wasn't at that level.

96
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,800
Well,
you know what the difference is?

97
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,030
Like some people just use
athleticism and timing and they just,

98
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,550
they just try to be creative.

99
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,030
What he does is he has a full system of
like what to do in varying positions and

100
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:33,720
what to do depending upon
your opponent's reaction,

101
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,360
but then on top of that
there's also creativity,

102
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,590
which is and savagery. Yeah. Oh yeah.
He's a savage mother fucker. Yeah.

103
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:45,480
He's very sad. What is the highlight
reel? Pullup rob his highlight reel.

104
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,450
I mean he,
he not points stash in the right.

105
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,700
That's the thin.
Then rob came.

106
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,390
It's really incredible when you think
about like how many great fighters came

107
00:06:57,391 --> 00:07:00,420
out of Holland and
kickboxers in particular.

108
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,670
It's just one small country
and here it is right here.

109
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,000
Get to see some of it. Look at, rob
came following up on a motorcycle.

110
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,640
Sexy Bitch.
So stoic to angry.

111
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,020
Well back in the day he was,

112
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,080
which is really interesting if you know
him now because he's so friendly and

113
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,110
huggy and he's like a big fluffy dog.

114
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,090
He's a fascinating guy. He really
is, but his, his knowledge of,

115
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:31,050
of kickboxing,
he's just so fucking tremendous.

116
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,910
I love how he sat down on
his punches like a boxer,

117
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,460
like shifting his weight
because he's,

118
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,660
I don't see a lot of kickboxers
that do that. Well yeah,

119
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,580
we're still here and then they
rotate, rotate, but they don't,

120
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:48,550
he's like really kind of getting in
here, you know, like a boxer more.

121
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,420
Do you think that's because
when you do dig down your,

122
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:54,720
is your sort of compromising your
ability to throw kicks for a brief moment

123
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,370
because you really digging in, but he's
knowing he knows when to do it too.

124
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:00,830
This his fight Iq.
Right.

125
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,180
It's knowing when to do it.
And it's also,

126
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,850
I s my pet peeve with we tie,
look at him.

127
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,710
My pet peeve with [inaudible] is when
they throw punches, they kind of come up.

128
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,930
It's like a very triumphant
looking isn't it? It's like,

129
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,410
and it's like that doesn't make any
fucking sense cause you won't punch with

130
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:23,040
power, not the same power. Um,
and you can't get out of the way.

131
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,640
Why do you think they do?
I didn't think that.

132
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:28,050
I just think they weren't taught well.
I wasn't,

133
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,520
I just recently started changing
my style. You know, but um,

134
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,880
when you kick you're up, you kinda
come up into the kick, you know,

135
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,850
like raise up and then they
try to punch in that way.

136
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,280
And I really feel like just
with mixed martial arts,

137
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,520
when you are doing wrestling,

138
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:47,610
you have to like be respectful
that you're doing MMA fight,

139
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,170
but kind of embody that, you know, that
wrestling technique when you're punching,

140
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:54,270
you got to embody that punching
technique when you're kicking,

141
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,300
you got to embody that kicking technique.
And same with Jujitsu.

142
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,800
Like you wouldn't stand as a Muy Thai
fighter if you're doing a wrestling move

143
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,220
right in an MMA fight, of course.
And I think with Moyie high fighters,

144
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,530
they don't understand that.
It's like when you're punching,

145
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,530
you're like kind of sit down and
rotate. You got a hotel. I like to say,

146
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,820
Oh take [inaudible] I have good hotel.
And then when the kick,

147
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,790
they got to come up when they need,
they got to come up. You know,

148
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,510
it's different and they don't make that
distinction. And then they don't produce,

149
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,240
they don't optimize on their body and
the power that they could produce.

150
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,000
That's always been a big issue with,

151
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:31,150
with MMA is fighters trying to figure out
exactly how to position themselves and

152
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,220
how to move and then all the variables,
right.

153
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:37,870
The how many different ways there are
to do it really successfully. Like UCL,

154
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,380
Conor McGregor stands wide stance kind
of sideways. He stands almost like,

155
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,850
like a karate guy a lot around his,
his strong weapons. Yeah. Yeah.

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,240
Whereas different guys have, you know,
different ways of doing like, you know,

157
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:55,130
Daniel Cormier, a very different style.
No hands up, high moves forward, you know,

158
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:57,520
a lot of Bob and weave in
as much more like a totally,

159
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,980
you gonna fuck if you get hit, you
get your handle on him though. No.

160
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,900
Or Connor does. Right. I kind of take it,
can you stay away from exactly. Exactly.

161
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:11,010
This is more like, come at
me, bitch grabbed me, but
I'm going to come and get ya.

162
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,640
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

163
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,150
Uh,
but it's uh,

164
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,110
it's fascinating also how a lot of people
that come from certain backgrounds,

165
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:22,860
like even wrestlers who come
from a wrestling background,

166
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:26,760
they have to alter their own wrestling
style for MMA. Like a lot of wrestlers,

167
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,500
specifically guys who stand in an Orthodox
position position when they're boxing.

168
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,070
But if there were a right handed wrestler,
a lot of times they'd be standing,

169
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:39,090
so yeah. And they'd be shooting with
the right leg forward. Uh Huh. Uh Huh.

170
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,770
So it's a lot of judo to yeah. Right.
Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of weird,

171
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,670
like MMA is such a different thing.
It's so different.

172
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,140
There's so like it's where all the pieces
come together and some of them don't

173
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:53,070
line up that good.

174
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,790
Yeah. Yeah. I think the best people
are the ones that can make it line up.

175
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,850
Sure. Yeah. And that's
at the most fluidity

176
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,490
when you see,
um,

177
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,280
particularly you because you're a world
champion Muay Thai fighter and when you

178
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:10,810
see the level of standup in
MMA, for sure. Now with women,

179
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:13,180
it's the highest it's ever been right.
Like right around now.

180
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,190
But it's still not quite the level
that you would see in like championship

181
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:22,270
Moitai except for girls like Valentina.
Yeah.

182
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,480
She's amazing. Yeah. Cyborg
of course is very scary.

183
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,370
Yeah, she is. She's so
nice. Super Nice. Right.

184
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,550
This pulled out. Sorry. That's all right.
That's fair. Yeah. You can move it around.

185
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,080
Yep. There we go. There you go. All
right. Yeah. Um, yeah. Have you met her?

186
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,450
You'd be like, really? I feel
bad for making fun of her.

187
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,580
She made fun of her before.
Yeah. She's so nice.

188
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,820
She's, I'm just got to be like this
really a tender soul or heart. Yeah.

189
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,250
Which is funny because it seems genuine,
very genuine,

190
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,460
very, very genuine. And she's
matching people. It's like, yeah,

191
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,900
well that's genuine to,
Yup.

192
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,110
Yeah. It's like, so whatever
it is, it's 100% and that's,

193
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:04,800
and there's something a really,
um,

194
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,730
rare and, and then, uh,

195
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,340
so powerful because people
aren't 100% right. You know,

196
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:17,140
there aren't 100%, like fully, like,
just heartbroken, wide open, um, um,

197
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,240
soft and then they're not 100%,
you know, violence. Right.

198
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,750
And she's just like 100% so
cool about her. Yeah. Yeah.

199
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,320
That's interesting. Right? Like when she
fights, she's 100% [inaudible] violence.

200
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,180
Yeah. And that is, that's,

201
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,710
that's something that you see in a lot
of lot of champions. It's like there's a,

202
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,330
there's an ability like there's an ability
to be like a really nice person and

203
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:46,930
then a terrible person or I'm
not even a terrible person.

204
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,950
A furious competitor.
Yeah. You know? Yeah.

205
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:55,390
When you first started fighting,
did you just find that inside of you?

206
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,230
Did, you know it was always there,
like that's you ha cause you're,

207
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,471
you're a person that I,

208
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:04,471
if I had to like if I had explained you
like you're like very energetic and fun

209
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:08,280
loving, you're very nice person
skipping around your studio util fun.

210
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,770
Like you're a fun person hearing
when we probably met in like,

211
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,930
I want to say it was 2003
it was the bomb squad days.

212
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,370
I was about 28 yeah.
Bam.

213
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,240
42 the dizzy. Yeah. Right. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. But you've always been like that.

214
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,560
But then when I've seen you fight,
like this is a different Miriam,

215
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,590
Miriam, when Miriam comes
to fight, it's like, oh,

216
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:36,460
she got a little switch in there and
you hit a switch and then you become a

217
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:40,240
different person and then it's not
just that you're a competitor, you're,

218
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:45,241
you become super hyper focused and
aware and ruthlessly aggressive.

219
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,910
Yeah. Yeah. I, um,

220
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,800
did you know that was always in you
before you fought? Who is new? That I,

221
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,300
I would always have a trouble with
girlfriends and I mean like dating,

222
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:04,310
I mean like try to have a girl that's
a friend when I was younger because I

223
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:08,980
would hurt them. You've heard them
physically? Yeah. Accidentally. Yeah.

224
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,750
It was wrestling around with
this one woman all like, yeah,

225
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,561
we're going to be friends.

226
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,570
We're like the same height and we're
wrestling around and playing around.

227
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:20,571
If we were like partying in Vegas and I
were wrestling and I've wrapped my legs

228
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,660
around her rib cage and squeeze
and cracked something in there. Oh,

229
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:28,260
where were you? You were on
the ground. It's like utopia.

230
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:30,240
And then we went to this
after party afterwards.

231
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,130
And you were dressed like in my
twenties drunk or whatever, you know,

232
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,480
or whatever or whatever. And uh,
he was, my size is like, you know,

233
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:42,520
she wanted to wrestle too, so I
was like, oh, can't wrestle too.

234
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:46,230
And yet cracked something in there. Yeah.
She didn't want to be my friend anymore.

235
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,710
She was mad at you? Yeah.
It was really sad. Oh yeah.

236
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,710
Well you probably off light.

237
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,410
Anybody gets upset that, you know, it's
not like you meant to hurt her. No.

238
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,910
But Ivy prep, why the fuck that is a
weird thing that people do, right? I mean,

239
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:05,030
I've seen guys do it and girls do
it where they start play wrestling,

240
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,330
but they have no fucking idea
what they're doing. And then,

241
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,480
and then they hurt themselves and they
bite off more than they could chew. Well,

242
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,560
that's a common thing.
For whatever reason.

243
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:15,950
People get a little drunk or whatever
and then they want to wrestle.

244
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,190
So what I used to do is I used to let
people play around with me and then I end

245
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:25,580
up getting stabbed in the
eyes or with fingers. Oh yeah.

246
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:29,360
So now I don't, I'm like, all right, cool.

247
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,080
That's the number one draw with you
anymore. MMA for sure. They'll fucking,

248
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,200
I fucking hate it. There's so many
guys like look at my Michael Bisping.

249
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,900
He has one eye that's like completely
fucked up though. He's got oil in his eye.

250
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,680
They should um,
penalize more higher for that.

251
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,860
100%. Yeah, I think that, um,

252
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,970
that would the behavior with
disc decrease or think so too.

253
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,950
I think one point, I think one point for
a nut shot and one point for an Ebook,

254
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,770
just period. You didn't mean to do
it. That's great. But you did it.

255
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,980
So for the second not shot, no first note
shot first not shot first. I poke my,

256
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,170
because I don't have nuts, so I'm a little
bit more lenient on that one. I'm like,

257
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,940
oh well whatever.
Well,

258
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,050
Brian Foster is a dude who fought for
the UFC back in the day. He lost it. Nut.

259
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,370
So funny. Oh, dairy.
I knew somebody. Okay.

260
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:27,371
So now we're reminded me of this
guy that was at the old fair techs.

261
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,250
Clemon Tina when Backlund
Alex Khan was there and he,

262
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:34,790
so the rumor had it that
he had one ball and yeah.

263
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:39,560
And he was kind of grumpy and
sorta like insecure and yeah,

264
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,180
I guess so. So this I just thought
of him and it just made me laugh.

265
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,590
So it's not just what the hell's in
general? No, but that would be really,

266
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,570
that would be super painful
to lose one of those.

267
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,000
Apparently what happened was ruptures.
He was sparring and like,

268
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,900
like one last round decided not to wear
his cup and went out there and slam.

269
00:16:58,901 --> 00:16:59,450
Whoa.

270
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:04,450
God took on right on the sac and
burst that he's still fighting.

271
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,540
I saw him, uh, on uh, uh, smaller,
uh, one of those, you know,

272
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,480
like a access TV fights recently to me,
like a breast implant is ruptured.

273
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,760
Oh there's so much.
It's all over the place.

274
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,580
A little breast implant helps
you through your system.

275
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,610
It would be like if a breast
implant helped you be a woman,

276
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,280
cause that's like the sac that produces
your testosterone, this stupid design.

277
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,820
Well another buddy of mine
lost one to cancer. Oh,

278
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,830
just impregnated is lady
[inaudible] still works. Yay.

279
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,950
You'll Duncan to Dunkin.

280
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,730
But um, we're talking about getting
kicked in the balls. Oh yeah. One point.

281
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:49,130
Just one point for Ipos.
One point for ball shots.

282
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,630
Just take a point away every time.
I think that would be giant.

283
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,750
I think that's fair. I would, it would
fucking hell so many people doing this.

284
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,520
The thing is we're good. I
poke, we'll change the change,

285
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:04,500
the change, the fight 100% it can, it
can sway the fight one way or the other.

286
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,350
Yeah. You know, so I, I don't, I, that's,

287
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,650
and people that they've
gotten poked in the eye,

288
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,360
the reflexive continue and then they
get fucked up and then they lose a fight

289
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:19,380
that they were winning.
Exactly. Yeah. That's terrible.
Terrible. It's a huge swing.

290
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,680
I think one point absolutely.

291
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:26,070
And I think there should be a better
way to determine whether or not a guy's

292
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,730
eyes had been compromised by that Ipos.
And sometimes it's not within the,

293
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,770
I mean everybody wants to
see the fight continue,

294
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,330
but if you really had to think about it,

295
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,220
like if this guy really can only see out
of one eye, it's not right. Yeah. Yeah.

296
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,060
Especially when it wasn't their fault,
but it's also such a fucking shit design.

297
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,620
All your fingers are just out there. Maybe
they should just curve them more. Yeah,

298
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,740
like the same design just curved.
They automate it.

299
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,790
Like when you have a good hand wrap,

300
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,260
like when they wrap your hands for
the fight. When it's a good one,

301
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,960
they just sit like this,
like your hands just sit there.

302
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:57,750
So they're just already ready
to, you know, it's perfect.

303
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,380
Well there's someone that I know that's
working closely with the UFC that's

304
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,550
working on new design,
but I think it's going to be okay.

305
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,820
But still the fingers are exposed.

306
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,180
I think almost like the fingers should
be covered and how are they going to

307
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:13,080
careers. But I think he covered it like
a bad glove. You know how bad gloves,

308
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,300
like those old school Everlast God
gloves be amazing for me. Yeah.

309
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,850
For a grappler. I don't think they'd like
that. You'd be good for grappler too.

310
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,210
If I had to ground mat gloves on,
I don't think I'd have a problem with it.

311
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,930
The weirder I grab the maybe you know
like a wrestler and then, I don't know.

312
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,890
I think the real, I think he'd
give you more traction. Honestly.

313
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,370
The real problem is
the pad on the knuckle.

314
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:38,710
Like when you're going behind the
neck where you're choking behind that,

315
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,320
it's very hard to get that fucker behind
the neck. Nothing's off that path. It is.

316
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:46,500
It's hard. I've grappled with, you
know, I've never had an MMA fight,

317
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:50,400
but I had grappled quite a bit
with with gloves. What do these,

318
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,080
does this aspiring grappling gloves and,
yeah. Yeah. Those are just like, um,

319
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,520
those are just a little bit
more padding, but those, yeah,

320
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,360
that's a little bit better. Pride gloves
were better. Honestly. Quite honestly,

321
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,620
cried gloves really had much more
curve to them and there was very few.

322
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:11,940
I pokes in pride.
I won't even fuck with a boxing glove.

323
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:15,840
That doesn't curve like it doesn't like
if I have to make a fist inside the

324
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,570
glove, I'm not going to
deal with that. That's good.

325
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,500
See this is like someone had observed
this a long time ago that look at the UFC

326
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,660
gloves on the right and the
pride gloves in the left.

327
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:28,470
The prod glove is your hands curve
the way better?

328
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,970
It's way better glove.

329
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,290
Yeah and the back of your hand
is like padded in a weird spot.

330
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,060
I don't know why they pad right here.

331
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,530
Like right above the wrist scope
would make that like right there.

332
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,660
The one that one though.
If you did a spinning back fist hit,

333
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,010
there's a little bones.
Yeah, right. They do break.

334
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,600
But most of the time you're doing that.

335
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:53,020
You're hardly ever doing it like a back
fist are kind of doing it like a hammer

336
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:56,080
fist and then the real thing is
happening with a lot of fighters.

337
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:59,140
Is there a hit and foreheads?
Snapping arms?

338
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,810
Paul felt that if you hit me
with, I'll be, I'll fucking,
you get mad. I get so mad.

339
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:07,820
And why do you get rid of
the

340
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,390
bullshit bullshit, bullshit
move, which is the bullshit.

341
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,360
Some people have moves that they feel
are bullshit moves like offended.

342
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,590
Like if somebody asks kicked you that I
don't care. That wouldn't be bullshit.

343
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,250
They pushed, kicked me in the face and
I wouldn't care. I'd be like, all right,

344
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,450
but it spinning back bullshit. But it's
so good. It's such a good technique.

345
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,680
Some fucking corn ball about that. Okay.
What about spinning elbows though? Yeah,

346
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,260
those are awesome and
I'm not great at them,

347
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:41,710
but that doesn't make any sense. I know
I contradict myself to excellence, right?

348
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,790
Yeah, it is weird, right? Yeah.

349
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,760
Well I mean I think they should
allow spinning back fist and boxing.

350
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,560
I'm like interesting

351
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,940
how everybody would be so
cocky. You know. So many guys.

352
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,530
They're sad. The boxing fans would
be, how many guys would get flatlined?

353
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,350
How many guys who don't know
what the fuck to do about it?

354
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:10,310
You're standing plan superman punches.
Well,

355
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,390
superman punches.
I think our legal right.

356
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,980
They react the same way,
right? No one would think you
throwing a leg kick. Why is,

357
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,750
why is mine cause cause you have
all these hair. I'm bald as fuck.

358
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,370
Oh there we go. There
you go. That's better.

359
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,280
Okay. Um, yeah,

360
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,480
but why can't they spinning back fist in
boxing? I don't know. Should be able to,

361
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,490
they are very purist,

362
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,750
but I see where they're
coming from in a certain way.

363
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,780
Like when boxers talk shit
about MMA and striking in MMA,

364
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,680
I see where they're coming from the
wrong because your shit won't work.

365
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,800
Like come try that shit.
You're going to get taken down stupid.

366
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,930
Like this is the whole reason
why they do it a different way.

367
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,960
But I actually do believe that a boxer
with incredible footwork and a jab,

368
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,240
a great job could survive and win in an
MMA fight as long as he doesn't fight a

369
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:10,060
long guy with good kicks,
like a Jon Jones,

370
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,340
Jon Jones just kicked the shit
out of you from a distance.

371
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,050
You're not even going to get close to him.

372
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,530
And then by the time you've
eaten all those leg kicks,
you're not moving so good.

373
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:21,980
Yeah. And Smash your face. I
agree. Yeah. But yeah, I think,

374
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,240
I think footwork is key. Do you remember
when Vince Foster, when he was a shit,

375
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,450
not quite world class anymore.

376
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:32,080
He'd lost a title and this is what
worries me because I don't remember shit.

377
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,040
You don't remember shit?
Well, he fought Masato,

378
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,000
but when Masato was the
king of k one over Japan,

379
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:44,860
Masato the sexiest Japanese man I've ever
seen. Pretty sexy. Yeah. He's super lazy.

380
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,190
Sexy isn't sexy.
Yama,

381
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,360
I dunno know sexy yama is
what you don't know. Sexy,

382
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,590
sexy on fought in the UFC several
times. Fought in pride. Yeah.

383
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,500
I don't know who that is. That's a great
name now. A gorgeous, gorgeous man.

384
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,350
Feel like that should be a super Sushi
roll areas. There's sexy yama autos.

385
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,320
Way better looking. Yeah. You say that
you're not succeed, yamas presence.

386
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,410
Look at that. I like the way glows. Yeah,
look at them. I mean it was beautiful,

387
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,190
but those pecs, yeah, he's got
that cross dangle and super low.

388
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:18,200
What's going on with that?
You look that cro,

389
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,320
it's almost like a belly button ring or
some shit. That's a deal breaker, right?

390
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:23,180
A dude with a belly button ring.
How about that?

391
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:26,180
A guy or a gorgeous guy with a
belly button ring. He's freaky.

392
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,300
Is that what it means? He vein
or gay as fuck. More likely.

393
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,710
That's something men just never rubbing.

394
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:40,190
It means he's freaky or he takes too
many cell face. Yeah, it definitely does.

395
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:41,200
She either.
So yeah,

396
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,050
that's something any man's ever
bravely tried to rock my note. Guys Do.

397
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:48,290
Nipple rings, like a real freaky dude.
We're doing it once you've seen it.

398
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:52,400
A belly button ring on a male.
One time I saw a pierced.

399
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,240
Who's that?
Masato there it beautiful.

400
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,680
I thought you were showing
me a belly button ring.

401
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,040
There's better pictures of him. There
is better. He's really good looking.

402
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,780
Very handsome and still is and
you know, and and still, you know,

403
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,420
is very active and all sorts of uh,

404
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,190
promotions and stuff.
Japan, when he fought no,

405
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:16,120
when he was gonna Fight Petrosian and
portrays you and was killing sour.

406
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,630
And what happened? It was supposed to be
his like, uh, there's one song. Goodbye.

407
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,510
Yeah. Yeah. And so he's watching
Petrosian Dis, I think it was sour.

408
00:25:25,511 --> 00:25:28,750
Destroy any sour and, and, uh,

409
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,710
he's just like, fuck, he's like, pull up

410
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:39,040
Masako versus, um, Vince Philips.
Because what was interesting about this,

411
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:43,750
it was a, it was like, do you remember
when I'm Shannon the cannon, um,

412
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,260
decided to fight in k one and he fought,
uh,

413
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,800
Tom Erickson and a kickboxing
match. No, you don't remember,

414
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,500
but that was a similar thing, but
Tom Erickson was not, you know,

415
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:58,501
Tom Erickson was a wrestler who's an
MMA fighter and a Shannon Briggs eight,

416
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,410
a couple of leg kicks and it was talking
about it on the podcast like that.

417
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:06,340
He was trying to play it off. It was
like, God damn, that shit hurt. But, uh,

418
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,200
he wound up Kaylyn,
Tom Erickson,

419
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:12,880
but Tom Erickson at the time was not
nearly the kind of Stryker that Vince

420
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,650
Phillips was when Vince
Phillips Swap Masato.

421
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,850
Vince Phillips had beaten worldclass
fighters, I think. Who did he beat?

422
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,030
He beat some fucking high
level worldclass boxers.

423
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,960
And then, you know, we got like 36,

424
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:30,070
37 38 and then took this
fight was 37 at the time.

425
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,430
Uh,
I don't know.

426
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,790
So he fought Vince Phillips,

427
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:37,510
but it was so weird seeing a Vince
Phillips walk out there barefoot.

428
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,820
I mean they should have let him wear
boxing shoes cause he's not thrown into

429
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,190
kicks. Yeah. And Masato just

430
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:49,380
gimme gimme some fit. Beautiful
Man. Perfect bone structure.

431
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,970
He's ridiculous.
Perfect hair to English.

432
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,390
And Vince Phillips was like, what
the fuck did I sign up for? Yeah,

433
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,490
that feeling that they have when they're
at the shoulder about to get leg kicked.

434
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,350
So right away you opens up inside
and just moves away from the punches.

435
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,060
Sets goes up high.

436
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,920
It goes up high punched times kicking into
the arms and that goes across the leg.

437
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,170
See that's a, that's a weird one right
there across the thigh. Not Shot,

438
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,170
but this was, this is at the time,
like one of the first times that a,

439
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,200
a real world class boxer had attempted
a kickboxing fight and know that's um,

440
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,610
friends both. It did that too.
Do you remember frowns both up?

441
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,420
He was a heavyweight contender and
boxing in the eighties and nineties

442
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,800
to watching fights.

443
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,710
If you talked to my wife and ask her
what she told me about 10 minutes ago,

444
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,420
I will not remember what the fuck she
said was a lot of shit that I don't

445
00:27:57,421 --> 00:28:01,950
remember. But I have like storage
units in my brain and stuff like, oh,

446
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:05,040
that's interesting. What happened there?
This happened. Oh, why did that happen?

447
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,290
Why did this go wrong? Oh, okay.

448
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:11,700
Pull up a Georgia Petrosian versus um,
uh,

449
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,290
Andy Sour as a u e r does it know,
how's it highspot Oh,

450
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:20,400
here's friends both. Yeah.
So you, so friends both.

451
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,410
This is France both at fat as fuck
too. He had like, he had hit the wall.

452
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,760
He was the white buffalo.
He's a South African heavyweight,

453
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,403
but he,
uh,

454
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,610
he actually learned how to kick a little
bit and he was not just boxing guys,

455
00:28:35,611 --> 00:28:38,820
but his, his hands were just
way better than most boxers are.

456
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:41,430
Most kickboxers rather cause
he was at one point in time,

457
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,530
a real heavyweight contender.
This is not a good example then,

458
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,430
which was 2015. Holy Shit
Dude, that this is 2000.

459
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:54,330
This guy was a fucking contender
in the 90s he's already hurt.

460
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,040
Yeah. This is, she had thrown a knee.
Did you watch the chocolate Dell fight?

461
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,140
I just the end of it.
Yeah. Not Good. Right?

462
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,960
How old is he now? 50 yeah,
so there's hope for me.

463
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,490
Well, you've never been
knocked out the way he's,

464
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,050
he's been knocked out so many times.
I don't think I've ever been knocked out.

465
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,960
Not In the gym. Not ever flash,
flash knockdown. That's it. Yeah.

466
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,780
I've had concussions and been knocked out
from like falling and the rain falling

467
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:29,400
off a second floor
landing when I was a kid,

468
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,500
but in fighting and ever
[inaudible] trucks also,

469
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:39,450
I think there was an issue with his style
because his style was so aggressive,

470
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,280
aggressive that people
could just set, set, set,

471
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,250
boom and counter like
Rashad Evans did with him.

472
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,550
And so you're getting his momentum coming
forward and the shy and we get flat

473
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:54,600
line. It doesn't change.
No he doesn't. No.

474
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,700
He had a style that was incredibly
effective back in the day.

475
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,170
I think he became married to
that. That approach. You know,

476
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:09,610
the approach that works so well on Bob
Ballou so well on Tito in the early

477
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:11,590
fights,
he was just a marauder.

478
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,650
You could hit him in the face with a
fucking crow bar and he would just spit

479
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:18,700
metal out at you. You didn't give a
fuck. He was so bad ass back in the day.

480
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,200
He relied on that so much. I remember
all the no hawks. Yeah. Everybody,

481
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,110
a little kid to wear
Mohawks back in the day.

482
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,390
People will get in Japanese
symbols tattooed on their
head because of him. Yeah,

483
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,060
yeah, yeah. It's just that, that style,

484
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,940
there's a comes a certain point in time
and you just can't do that anymore.

485
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,820
You know, I think, um, I dunno,

486
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,860
like it's a martial artist,
you know,

487
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,650
artists evolve and they're like,
oh, well let me try this new paint.

488
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,490
Oh, let me try this, this,
this a new technique.

489
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,750
Let me try this shading. Let me, you
know, start sculpting. Let me try.

490
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:02,200
And I think with, uh,
especially MMA, you know,

491
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,300
there's just so much opportunity
to evolve and just add new, new,

492
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,930
new nuances to you as an artist. I mean,
I think that's what I love about it.

493
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,860
There's certainly is,
but one thing that does happen when,

494
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,030
when God's try to add a lot of things,

495
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:20,800
like say sometimes they'll try to like
say a wrestler will add a bunch of things

496
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:23,620
to his repertoire,
but then they stopped with the wrestling.

497
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,960
Wrestling is not as sharp and so then
when they go up against a really good

498
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:31,270
wrestler,
they falter and then they're,

499
00:31:31,271 --> 00:31:33,760
they don't have what brought them
to the dance in the first place.

500
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,560
But I think that's just looking at your
opponent and what's in front of you.

501
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:40,480
And also like being honest with yourself.

502
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,670
And like I think right now I'm looking
at getting back into fighting and if I

503
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:50,290
didn't feel the sharpness,
I didn't, I didn't feel the
fire and not just the fire.

504
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:53,800
If I didn't physically feel the sharpness,
if I didn't feel the reflexes,

505
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,430
I'd have to be honest with myself
and say, okay, don't do this.

506
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:02,110
Do you think that you would oh 100% be
capable of being rational and objective

507
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,620
about what you can do right now?
Yeah, yeah. Because I don't,

508
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,700
I don't fight for participation awards.
You know what I mean? Like I'm not like,

509
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:15,670
Hey, I'm a, but there's some UFC fighters
are like, I'm a UFC fighter. Yay.

510
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,140
I've made it. Like that's not really
making it. You're just another, you know,

511
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,610
like say I'm a world champion,
I'm a the best in the world. Emma,

512
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,620
that's like I'm a UFC fighter is like
a participation medal basically like

513
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:32,710
level. It shows that you're
a very high level fighter.

514
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:37,630
You're very right. But you and
your eyes, you as a champion,

515
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,250
that is what's important.
You want to be the queen.

516
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,570
You want to be a top of the hill
to the best of your best self. Yes.

517
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,580
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um, uh,

518
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,290
this one thing that I really
like about individual sports,

519
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,130
whether it's Jujitsu or Moy,
tai or any or boxing,

520
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,460
is that you can focus on just one sport
and all the various aspects of one

521
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:06,590
sport. And there's so much subtlety in
so much technique and so much to learn.

522
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,700
I mean you were what? Watch Floyd
Mayweather senior train people.

523
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:15,260
It's really interesting because he's
showing guys who are world class fighters,

524
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:19,550
like the subtle subtle aspects of boxing
and movement and things they're doing

525
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:21,680
wrong. He, you know, Simon Marcus,

526
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,000
he was working with Simon Marcus and he
was doing some training with sidewalks.

527
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,180
I'm like, this is so fast and had to
be hired for a guy like Simon. Yeah.

528
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,100
Cause he's a very rigid yes.
And he's,

529
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,510
he gets so much power from his rigidity
and so like boxing is much more,

530
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:38,780
it's not rigid. Right. You
know, it's like hip hop.

531
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:44,090
We know that it's got that, like that
beat to it and that like swag to it.

532
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:49,091
And Simon Marcus is just so that Moy
Thai style and a lot of grappling moving

533
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:54,280
forward. Yeah. He's a very
physically strong guy too. Yeah.

534
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,130
He looks like he's on Shit. Yeah,
he does. Hey good. Janine's jeans.

535
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:04,460
I remember Joe Schilling.
Yes I is. Yes. Is that beef?

536
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,160
Fuck yeah, that fourth. I can't remember
what a fucking crazy fight that was.

537
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,630
I was there for that. And it was all
the controversy on the first one. Right.

538
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,920
Cause it wasn't that there was
the illegal, was it illegal?

539
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:20,270
He hooked the back of the heel
or something. And then on the,

540
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,200
on the throat, on the, yeah, he,

541
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,730
this was the first fights.

542
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,110
So the first one at first fight Simon
Marcus one, but it was like a knot.

543
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,070
He got knocked out.
Right. So did from he, uh,

544
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,880
when Simon fell on him and he also
put his, he foot behind his heel.

545
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,280
Right. I guess. And there was
a lot of conscious about that,

546
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:43,370
whether that was legal or not.
And then when he fell on him,

547
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:47,870
I guess he hit Joe in the head, in the
jaw with his, his forehead or something.

548
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,390
And so Joe got up like this. Did you
remember that? Yes, I do now. Yeah.

549
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,590
Yeah. So the revenge that avid in
that last man standing tournament,

550
00:34:57,591 --> 00:34:59,570
which was a fucking crazy
thing to begin with,

551
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,760
where they were going to have to fight
three times in a night. Yeah. Yeah. So,

552
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:07,400
uh,
they fought in the first round.

553
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,440
Joe Fought Simon and it went
three rounds and it was a draw.

554
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,230
And so in the fourth round they had to
come out. Both guys were like, holy,

555
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,890
you know, Gloria goes one
more round. There's like fuck.

556
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:26,891
And Simon Marcus had kept spitting out
his mouthpiece and big John McCarthy took

557
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:29,240
a point away.
He goes,

558
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,480
he takes a point away from Simon because
Simon was exhausted as they were going

559
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:35,510
to war for three pl.
Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.

560
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,190
He was spitting on his mouthpiece,
peck, trying to gain some time.

561
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,140
Now he's pretty fucking Jack,
Jack.

562
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:44,550
And so now he's got one point down
going into a fight. That's a draw.

563
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,900
So he's got to move forward.

564
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,840
So he comes after Joe and Joe
knows he's got to come at him.

565
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:53,990
So Joe starts countering and he catches
him with this fucking nasty right hook.

566
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:59,100
I think it's coming soon. Right
here. Three or four seconds.

567
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,920
Well it was a wild fight.

568
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:06,690
Just a wild series of exchanges and
I think Simon, yeah, here it is.

569
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,640
Simon's moving forward. Boom. There it is.

570
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,940
And Simon had knocked Joe
down early in the fight.

571
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:16,710
I think he knocked Joe down in the first,
so he,

572
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:21,770
so Joe lost the first round and then
we'll probably one the second and third.

573
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,550
So it was a tie going into the fourth.

574
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,300
Wow. Yeah, it was a crazy
fight. Awesome fight. Doe.

575
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,670
They actually fought in lion
fight too. I've, I've, if I,

576
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,490
I've had a lot of concussions could be
wrong, but I thought it was the plot

577
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,060
controversy.
Yeah.

578
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:44,320
And then the second fight was in line
fight and it was winner take all the purse

579
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,960
and then I think it was glory. Mm. Yeah.
I think you're right. Yeah, that's,

580
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,170
that was round to get knocked down.
Yeah. Yeah. I, I loved lion fight.

581
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,770
I wish they'd kept it on access TV.
I don't know what the fuck happened.

582
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,920
I don't know where it is now. I think
it's like on a web app or some shit.

583
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:04,950
I was afraid to fight line fight because
of the judging really screwy decision.

584
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,970
It was just like, but it's not an athletic
commission thing. That seems more ago.

585
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:13,700
Athletic Commission thing than a lion
fight. It doesn't matter because whatever,

586
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:16,480
if they keep doing it in the
same spot so it doesn't matter.

587
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,400
So say the case with Vegas though.

588
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:22,870
I mean Vegas has some terrible fucking
judging sometimes. Yeah, and it's not,

589
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,800
I mean, I don't know how you
fix that other than fire.

590
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:29,800
Anyone who has any shitty decisions
and it seems like you can't even,

591
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,960
you can you petition, you can, but
nobody wins. See, that's fucked up.

592
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:35,883
It is fucked up.

593
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:41,340
I can't imagine when has anyone in your
recent memory or in your memory period

594
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:46,600
when is anyone appealed a decision and
one I've never, I've never heard of it.

595
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,010
[inaudible] that's crazy.

596
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,910
You think about all the fights that we've
seen and that we've never, we don't,

597
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,940
we can't even recall someone
who got fucked who went
back and reviewed the tape.

598
00:37:57,311 --> 00:37:59,260
Look, I, I'm hitting him three to one,

599
00:37:59,261 --> 00:38:03,160
two to one and it still lose
decision which has happened.
Yeah, that has happened.

600
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,370
There's been some agregious
horrible decisions

601
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,330
at, I hate about this
is I think that these,

602
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,940
the judges don't really think about
that. It's our lives. I think if,

603
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,900
if I have this loss because of your era,

604
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:23,090
the next time I fight I make less money
and I'm already not making that much

605
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:25,910
money. Like you're not even
thinking about how, how,

606
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:30,620
what this does to me as, as
an, as a fighter, you know?

607
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,030
Yeah. It doesn't, um, I don't think
that it's, they're not thinking about,

608
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,130
I think

609
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,680
it's, they're not competent.
I think when there,

610
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,040
I think there's certainly corruption
and there's certainly people that get

611
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:46,540
bribed. I guarantee that does still
probably happen. How do I guarantee?

612
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:47,620
Probably I can't write,

613
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:53,130
but I think more likely than that
is you're seeing incompetence.

614
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,040
I think you're seeing people that
don't have any martial arts training.

615
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,960
That's fucked up though.
Then that it's ego.

616
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,450
Like I can admit that they don't
know, oh my God, I had that job.

617
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,180
I fucking had that at a,

618
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:13,310
I was a WBC title defense and I'm
doing completely legal throws it,

619
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:17,730
I'm way high throws and he's telling
me no more slamming her on the canvas.

620
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,780
He's like, he says this
ain't no Jujitsu. No.

621
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:25,450
Literally People's, yeah. Oh yeah.

622
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,880
I said his name as Voldemort.

623
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,870
Oh my goodness. Tom, you have a,

624
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:36,230
your wins commission appeal retains
to FC champion. Wait a minute.

625
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,710
What is the commission appeal though?
What does that mean though?

626
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:44,660
That might be lost a submission and the
other person was a champion for 13 days.

627
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:49,310
She lost by submission, Huh? Yeah.

628
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,490
This was in at the end of 25th.
2016.

629
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,990
How has it overturned to a no contest?

630
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,530
I had that. So what did, what happened?

631
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,640
I googled your question and someone found
some examples of it happening and this

632
00:40:04,641 --> 00:40:06,640
was one of the three I found.
Oh Huh.

633
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,130
That's a little different cause that
seems like there was an error in the

634
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:14,810
officiating. And so if, if she lost by
submission and then they said it wasn't,

635
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,790
it wasn't legit. I had a decision
overturned. Did you really?

636
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:24,380
It was a fuck. What's
his name? John. Bigger.

637
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,410
The big rough.
Okay.

638
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,600
What's the name of John Big? John
McCarthy. John McCarthy. John Bigger.

639
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,670
It's a thing that they got the name John.
Um,

640
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:37,360
but I need a down deponent in the
head. Oh. But from where I was,

641
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:42,220
I didn't realize that. So I need her
once and she was like this. I was like,

642
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,950
Oh man, let me make sure this is
over with and I need her again.

643
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,720
But she was like five [inaudible] 11,
six feet ish, just among Duke super,

644
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:54,160
super long. And I didn't realize that
she was hired or knees or on the canvas.

645
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:58,360
I didn't know Justin Duke fought
Moy. Tai? No, this was an MMA. Oh,

646
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:02,980
I knocked her out, but, and
then I put one for good measure.

647
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:07,700
Oh, unfortunately, unfortunately he gave
me the win and then she appealed. She uh,

648
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,510
yeah, appealed it and then it
got overturned to a no contest.

649
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:15,510
It's not a DQ cause I mean I
didn't realize. Right, right.

650
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,830
That's interesting. Hm. Yeah. Cause
she would gone out anyway. Yeah. So I,

651
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,650
I've kind of fucked myself.
I gave her a leg to stand on.

652
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,050
Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. That was, that
was like, what organization
was that in? INVICTA. Mm.

653
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,250
How many fights do you have in
Invicta? Oh, three. Three I think.

654
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,320
How many is that all the most MMA fights
you bad. Oh God. Three right? Four. Four,

655
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,070
I think four. Now, when you talk
about coming back now, and I know,

656
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,840
you know you're recovering from
knee injuries and all this jazz,

657
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,200
what are you thinking of? Chunkiness
he looked great now. Yeah.

658
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,950
It's so much better because of snacking,
Modo,

659
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,050
no Nakamoto, healthy snacks. It man,

660
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,320
when you're 40 pounds overweight, you
smelled different. Do you know, like not,

661
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,760
not yourself. It's not yourself. This
is not 40 pounds. A lot is a lot.

662
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:12,060
What were you eating or not eating
or drinking all the time. Oh,

663
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:15,610
you're not working out and like limping.
Cause my name is cell. Fuck yeah.

664
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,840
This is a lot of a lot of grief.
Yeah.

665
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,610
But um, for someone like
you, it's gotta be hard to,

666
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:29,090
because you're so connected to
like your physical activity.

667
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,910
So to have that removed
and taken away from you,

668
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,810
well that was a mirror where you're
talking about like finding out who you

669
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:39,890
really are, who you think you are getting
that injuring, gaining all that weight.

670
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:43,730
I was like, oh, okay. Who I think I
am. I no longer have access to that.

671
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,280
So now who am I?
You know?

672
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:50,600
And it was like spent the last five years
trying to work that shit out. So yeah,

673
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,050
that happens. A lot of fighters
when they retire. Yeah. Okay.

674
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:58,310
I think I have it already.
What were you thinking? Well,

675
00:42:58,311 --> 00:43:02,060
that time was up because you've got
to feel like also you're 42 now,

676
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,570
so this is all happening at 37 which is,
you know,

677
00:43:05,571 --> 00:43:08,960
for some fighters it's towards
the end anyway. Yeah, no,

678
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,680
I was doing well at 37 I was doing
fine. No, you're doing great.

679
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,290
But there's a reality of
the clock. Yeah, for sure.

680
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:18,740
When you look at at least historically,
everyone outside of Bernard Hopkins,

681
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:24,350
he's amazing. Fucking amazing. Holy Shit.
46 years old fighting world class. I mean,

682
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,340
I think he beat,

683
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:31,030
did he beat Kelly Pavlik when he was like
46 I think he box Kelly Pavlik up when

684
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:33,530
he was 46 and lost to Joe Smith.

685
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:37,940
I think he was 51 but by the time we got
knocked out and sent out of the cage or

686
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:40,550
out of the ring. Oh, that guy.
Yeah, I know. He's amazing. Amazing.

687
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,750
43 when he fucking pablet he's like more
conservative now. Yes. When he fights.

688
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:50,330
Well he's done. But yeah.
Well he's a just recent stuff.

689
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,290
A masterful boxer just
absolutely understands
everything about boxing and he's

690
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:58,640
not going to put himself in a position
where he's going to get fucked up until

691
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:00,860
he couldn't help it anymore.
Like the Joe Smith fight.

692
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:04,870
It was like this has gotta be,
this is going to have yet and left too.

693
00:44:04,871 --> 00:44:08,330
It felt like cove was lighten them up
also like, oh I don't want to watch this.

694
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,700
You know, it hurts when you see
somebody so incredible when they're,

695
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,180
you know, when it's done.
Yes. Cause they just,

696
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:21,920
yeah. Yeah. I actually think
you're so much better than this.

697
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,260
It's especially like
when they're an artist.

698
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:27,350
Like there's something about when
you see chuck go out on a shield,

699
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:32,280
something about it to me,
I don't seeing it for sure.

700
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,130
I definitely would have liked it
if he didn't get knocked out again.

701
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,410
But one thing that I would,

702
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,850
I would like young fighters
to see is that this is,

703
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:46,740
there's consequences to choices in
terms of like how you approach these

704
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:49,500
exchanges and how you,
how you fight and then I'm,

705
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,770
I'm of a belief that you
should fight the correct way.

706
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,030
Don't fight the way that pleases your
boss or the crowd fight the way you,

707
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:59,750
the way you're supposed to
with your skills. Like yeah,

708
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,830
and win by knockout when you can,

709
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:05,010
but don't get knocked out because you're
trying to win by knockout and doing

710
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:08,100
something that you're overextending
yourself and exposing yourself and you're

711
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:10,650
compromising yourself.
Like that's not wise.

712
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,480
And I think part of fighting has
to be wise. It's exciting enough.

713
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,740
I mean it's fucking crazy and wild
enough but everybody wants every single

714
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:24,670
second of it to be filled with blood and
the crowd cheering and when they're not,

715
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:28,290
I mean how many times have we seen
fights where just there's a lull in the

716
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:32,280
action for a brief moment or they're
clinching and people start booing and then

717
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:36,090
someone caught mix it up. Boys mix it
up. Like, what do you mean mix it up?

718
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,430
The fuck are you do, what do you think
they're doing, man? They're fighting.

719
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,330
This is crazy talk, you know,
like you see it all the time.

720
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,780
Social media brain,
this is a little bit of that patient.

721
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,230
What everybody wants to be
a huge star two, you know,

722
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:54,231
everybody wants to do their best to
gain the most followers and get the most

723
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:57,370
love and gets the most applause.
You know,

724
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,160
there's a right way to fight
in a wrong way to fight.

725
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:02,850
And one of the things about watching guy
like chuck go out on a shield like that.

726
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:06,810
It's like this is the bed he made.
I mean,

727
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:11,430
this is his style. His style is
Marauder Berzerker move forward.

728
00:46:11,431 --> 00:46:15,270
Like Melvin Manhoef. When you see Melvin
go out on his shield, you go, look,

729
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:20,510
this is Melvin style. Yeah, yeah,

730
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,330
that's true. But if you see a guy like
sugar ray Leonard and he gets Kao,

731
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:29,130
do you like, oh Jesus, like
stop. You can't do it anymore.
Yeah, you're not really,

732
00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:32,490
you can't, you can't move the
way that made you successful.

733
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:36,330
Pernell Whitaker or something like that.
If you see them for, for whatever reason,

734
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:39,180
they can't move. Right. Do you remember
Pernell Whitaker? I know the name,

735
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:39,860
but I haven't watched

736
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,550
hi damn woman as I was just letting,
I'm like man,

737
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:48,740
he was a defensive genius.
Olympic gold medalist, 76 I'm,

738
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,720
I'm terrible. So people ask me,
they will ask me about the why crew,

739
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:57,170
Rob Mccoy and I'm just like,
I dunno,

740
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:02,360
it's both. Or they'll ask me, how
do you win a Moitai fight? And I go,

741
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,420
I don't know,
do more damage.

742
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:10,190
Like I don't fucking know what
scores higher elbow or knee or punch.

743
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,950
I don't know. It just fucking win. Right?

744
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,910
Like I have no idea where you
ever thinking what scores higher.

745
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:20,020
Just thinking I'm going to dominate this
motherfucker. This is my space. Yeah.

746
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:24,500
Like this is my, you know, yeah.
It's square a circle or what is that?

747
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:28,280
How You thinking about it? This is mine.
Well, yeah, cause I think you, you,

748
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:32,530
you dominate the space and like
it's about territory, you know,

749
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:34,600
and findings territory and
you start and it's even,

750
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,930
and they have to their side and you have
your side and you take the territory

751
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:42,700
away and you want them to feel like
it's not, there is space anymore.

752
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,770
Like that's how you impose your will.
You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah.

753
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,010
It's as simple.
I Dunno,

754
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,520
I dunno about fucking points
and this and that and it's shit.

755
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,570
Do you have no idea? Do
you ever teach? Uh, yeah.

756
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,990
Do you teach private lessons? Do you
teach classes? Like what do you teach?

757
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:05,940
A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Do you ever work
with fighters? Um, I have. Yeah. Yeah.

758
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,650
Yeah.
When you do it,

759
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,030
do you find that looking at it in a way
we were trying to explain it to someone

760
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:16,890
who's also trying to do what you do,
that it helps you understand what you do?

761
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,470
Um,
yeah.

762
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,850
Yeah. But I definitely
don't. You don't like it?

763
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,810
No, no. I, I, I still like
this conversation is the same.

764
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:33,811
Like it's more about like the tone you're
setting rather than the weapons you're

765
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:37,410
using. [inaudible] to me because it, it's,

766
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:42,310
it's really just like there's that
space and it's your job to own it.

767
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,210
[inaudible] you know, like you
own the center of the ring. You,

768
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:50,410
you dictate where they go. You take
things away, you know? It's like a,

769
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,240
it's an ex convict trying to get a job.

770
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,640
The doors just shut in their
face shut in their face.

771
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,800
Everywhere they turn shut in
their face shut in their face.

772
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:59,680
And interesting way to look like that's
how you want to make them feel like

773
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:01,500
you're approach. I don't, I don't want to,

774
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,160
I don't want an x comic to not be
able to get a job right in the ring.

775
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,700
You want to take shit away from somebody
and make them feel very discouraged.

776
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,440
Yeah. Yeah. Like you don't belong
here anymore and you know that,

777
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:17,760
you know, like that's what you
want them to feel. Yeah. Yeah.

778
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,300
And you don't want to fight me again.
That's another thing.

779
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:24,570
You want to make the field do, you
know, like this is these things.

780
00:49:24,571 --> 00:49:27,510
So you've got to understand
what you're doing there.

781
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,780
But insofar as like what scores
higher and what did this and the,

782
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:35,670
I don't fucking know, but for no fucking
idea, which just goes off of like how,

783
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,570
how my opponent is reacting to
what I'm doing to them. Right.

784
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:42,930
How they're reacting to me and that's
what I'm going to throw or where they move

785
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,060
and that's what I'm going to throw.
I don't think about like, oh,

786
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:47,940
is this going to score? Should I throw
this or this? Which will score higher.

787
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:52,860
Right. You can't, I don't know.
It's fucking retarded. Yeah. Yeah.

788
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,070
It's not a wise way to think,
I don't think.

789
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,260
I think especially in
something like more time,

790
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:01,650
which so many fights win by knockout
and so many fights are won by knockout.

791
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,500
Yeah. And it's such a, such
a devastating art. You know,

792
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:09,330
we think about just having the ability
to kick and knee and punch and elbow and

793
00:50:09,331 --> 00:50:11,190
all these different weapons you using.

794
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,190
I think we thought it doesn't hurt
that much. What does that mean?

795
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,030
What does that mean? Boy,
ty doesn't hurt that much.

796
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,460
Were talking about earlier about
breaking your elbow on someone's head,

797
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,490
but that didn't hurt at the time. At the
time it didn't hurt but adrenaline. No,

798
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,830
I mean it is like,

799
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:31,700
it just Bam. And I'm like, whoa,
she's bleeding. It's crazy.

800
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:34,880
And the refs like pulling me off her
and I don't think about how it felt.

801
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:36,440
I don't think about,
you know,

802
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:39,860
like when I got my ribs cracked
from a kick and then we tie fight,

803
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,510
I thought it was liver, so I was
like, I feel my pain. I'm like, no.

804
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:45,530
And then I'm like,
fuck you.

805
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:48,290
I'm in the fight and you pull yourself
back out of that pain cause you don't

806
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:50,780
want to fall into the pain because
it's hard to climb back up.

807
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:53,780
It's like swimming up,
up, um, upstream. Right.

808
00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:58,130
So you kind of kept falling to
that fucking pain and uh, but it's,

809
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:02,930
it's not, it's, I mean, it's
banged up, but it's not that bad.

810
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:07,640
Well, you don't have a tolerance
for it. Yeah. I just like, I mean,

811
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:11,030
your shins will be bruised
up, you know? I don't,

812
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:15,560
I mean we were up on Instagram once
of your legs. I know that hurt.

813
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,030
That really hurt.

814
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:21,100
What day was the week after the fight that
your legs were that fucked up? No, no,

815
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,960
no. That was right before I fought.
It was right before you Vaughn? Yeah,

816
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:27,140
so I had three fights and that one was
about right before the last one. Oh,

817
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:31,100
you're three fights in a day? No,
I had three fights over five days,

818
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:35,120
which made it worse actually because if
the three fights I've been in one day

819
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,950
then these,
yeah,

820
00:51:36,951 --> 00:51:41,890
so they had a day between each and
so the pain would set in and yeah,

821
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,820
it was Ifma. Was it in Thailand? Oh,
they're crazy over there. It was cool.

822
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:50,600
I liked it. That's wild. But that
shit hurt. That shit her for weeks.

823
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:53,840
Like I couldn't roll over in bed
like they couldn't, they couldn't,

824
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:57,560
you know how you stack your legs
and you snuggle up in your position?

825
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:02,210
Couldn't I had to and like put a
pillow in between them? Yeah. Oh,

826
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:06,530
there was the bruising was behind
on the calves like it was, it was,

827
00:52:06,531 --> 00:52:10,260
I got kicked in the front. Yeah.
But there's so much blood, you know,

828
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:13,760
internal bleeding from the bruising.
It went to the back to my cap.

829
00:52:13,761 --> 00:52:17,660
So it actually is Cirque and
calculating my whole leg and bruising.

830
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:22,250
And then it went down, um, my ankles,
both sides and then down to my toes.

831
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:27,800
So you took the pictures, that was you
in between the second and third fight.

832
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,700
That was the bright before the
third fight I was waiting at,

833
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:36,300
it was the king's cup that says the king's
birthday. Yeah, it's, yeah. So that's,

834
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:41,450
yeah. And you can see my ankle and
it actually went underneath my toes.

835
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,300
And this is before there was a fight
again. Both legs were like that.

836
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:49,130
Both were like this and you have to
fight again. Yeah. So do you know what?

837
00:52:49,131 --> 00:52:51,320
And Matt Johnson on,
that's him rubbing me.

838
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,600
And so he tried to give me the white tie.

839
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:56,240
They give you the preflight
massage with the tile in it.

840
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:00,950
He couldn't fucking touch me. Is it
so bad? Fuck. Did you fight like this?

841
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:05,780
I don't know, but I did.
That is so insane. Yeah. And
their legs are so banged up,

842
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:10,700
the fact that you fought. Yeah. Yeah. And
it's so like mentally I was just like,

843
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:14,330
wow, this is, this is, this is
happening, this is, I'm going to do this.

844
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:18,470
And I'd look at my legs, okay,
okay, this is happening, this is,

845
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:22,730
this is okay. And yeah, just
started fighting. What did you feel?

846
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:27,600
I don't think about that. Sometimes you
get kicked in, it gets, it goes through,

847
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,230
like it gets through here for shield, you
know, like you kind of put up this like,

848
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:35,160
I dunno when I fight, it's like
I'm fighting and thing. Yeah.

849
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:39,960
It's a four shields in a
sense, you know? Um, and uh,

850
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,420
sometimes if it hurts enough, like when
I got my ribs cracked, I felt that right.

851
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,200
I can went through and I like disrupted
my force shield and so sometimes that's

852
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:52,860
something we'll go through like a good
solid were killed. So my four shields for,

853
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,780
she'll activate your attitude, your
mindset. This is like you're fighting,

854
00:53:57,781 --> 00:54:01,260
you're, you're ready to accept all
sorts of things. Yeah. Like I could die

855
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,770
or even harder.

856
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:08,700
I could kill someone if you think it'd
be harder to kill someone than to die and

857
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:13,560
so on. You. Yeah. Yeah. Because then
you think about their loved ones.

858
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,350
So looking at all the people
that loved you, we fight.

859
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:22,100
Think about all the people that love
you. Right? Yeah. And so when we fight,

860
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,320
I didn't, I didn't break any
rules, but I killed you. Right.

861
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,110
I think about all your loved ones.
Everybody that loves you with,

862
00:54:30,111 --> 00:54:34,960
that's attached to you. I
think about that, all that pain

863
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,120
because of what I did to you. Right.
Even though I didn't break any rules.

864
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,640
Have you ever been in a
promotion where someone died

865
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,720
but that's heavy, right?
Yeah. And I don't,

866
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:51,370
I think probably why a lot of fighters,

867
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,920
I have noticed like there's,
there's,

868
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:58,100
I don't think the majority of fighters,
um,

869
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:03,540
look at what they do with
the gravity that it deserves.

870
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,550
You know,
like you could kill somebody.

871
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:10,600
Like you need to think about that
and be okay with that. Not Okay,

872
00:55:10,601 --> 00:55:12,960
but just understand like,
all right,

873
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:18,040
that could happen and I'm going to be
co a calm consciously knowing this and

874
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:21,940
choosing to go forward. They
just think, oh, I'm going
find it. It'll be fun. It'll,

875
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,210
you know, whatever. Or it'll be
hard or I'm gonna like whatever.

876
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,590
They don't think about these things.

877
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:29,800
Is this something that you thought
about when you were young? Yeah,

878
00:55:29,801 --> 00:55:32,680
before I really got into
it. So you, this is, uh,

879
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,910
something you've been contemplating
even before you started fighting,

880
00:55:36,911 --> 00:55:40,720
you are aware of all the
possibilities? Yeah, I,

881
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,870
okay. All right. I'll say it.
So I was, um, it was about 28,

882
00:55:46,871 --> 00:55:51,550
I think, and I don't think I
had my pro boxing debut yet.

883
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:57,270
And I took some mushrooms
and I was thinking somewhere
along the trip I started

884
00:55:59,411 --> 00:56:02,410
thinking about fighting and I started
thinking about like what could happen to

885
00:56:02,411 --> 00:56:03,244
me.

886
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,210
And I think I started thinking about the
death of me and then I started thinking

887
00:56:07,211 --> 00:56:10,810
about what could happen to my
opponent. Like, what's worse than that?

888
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:16,000
And I thought about ice could see like
somebody I fight and I saw all the like,

889
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:20,020
like lines of gold threat
attached into them like uh,

890
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,460
from their loved ones.

891
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:26,500
And then all the got snipped when
they died. Yeah. I saw this loan,

892
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:31,120
this mushroom trip, and I was just like,
fuck. And so then when I decided to fight,

893
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,830
there's more intense,
you know,

894
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:39,670
and more commitment and more
resolve. That's heavy. Yeah.

895
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,910
Yeah. But that is what it is. Right.

896
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:47,740
And that's where I think real,
there's more power

897
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,300
to people that have never fought before
and people that don't understand finding

898
00:56:51,301 --> 00:56:53,970
they did this or I don't get the appeal.
I don't know why you watch it,

899
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:58,920
that the reason that p one of the reasons,
there's many reasons,

900
00:56:58,921 --> 00:57:03,180
but one of the reasons why people enjoy
participating in it so much is because

901
00:57:03,181 --> 00:57:07,560
there's so much risk and it's so
dangerous and it's so difficult,

902
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,930
so unbelievably difficult to prepare.

903
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,050
Unbelievably difficult to put
yourself in the proper mind state,

904
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:14,770
specially to be a champion,
to,

905
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:20,080
to beat the best of the best and to get
to the top of the heap that once you do

906
00:57:21,181 --> 00:57:24,960
succeed,
like explain that feeling to people,

907
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:28,530
explain that feeling when they raise
your hand and put that belt around your

908
00:57:28,531 --> 00:57:30,620
waist and the crowd is cheering.

909
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:37,050
I'm kind of weird cause I actually
get depressed. You get depressed,

910
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:41,700
you get depressed when you,
when uh, at times, yeah. Or,

911
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:45,930
or I'm just,
I think for me,

912
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:49,630
what I've come to realize about
myself is that it's about authentic.

913
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,980
They expressing myself in the moment.
And I think with a lot of my fights,

914
00:57:52,981 --> 00:57:54,150
I wasn't being honest.

915
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,800
I didn't take my heart and cut it open
and pour it out on the mat or the canvas.

916
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,210
I played it safe. I didn't go in for
the knockout. I didn't slip a punch,

917
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:05,010
encounter and,
and get inside.

918
00:58:05,011 --> 00:58:08,790
I stayed outside or when I was inside
I would clinch up an elbow and knee,

919
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,040
you know? So, um,

920
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:17,580
for me it hurts when I'm being
inauthentic. And I know that

921
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,640
with pretty much all of my
Moy Thai fights, I wasn't,

922
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:29,690
but is that the case or is it you
being hyper critical of yourself?

923
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:33,540
Always. Always. Oh, I said,
so I've, I've actually can,

924
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:36,110
you just said carry it on and
he can attest to this. I've,

925
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,980
I've come out of fights and, and won
the world title. It's done a great job.

926
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:45,570
And I co into the gym the next week
and it carried, this was stupid.

927
00:58:45,571 --> 00:58:48,150
I looked stupid. I didn't do
this right. This is fucked up.

928
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:52,530
I can't fight like that again. Like we got
to fix that. And it was just like that.

929
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:57,360
That's what makes a champion though.
Yeah. But mine was unhealthy,

930
00:58:57,690 --> 00:58:58,980
so mine was more,
I think,

931
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:04,100
I think I'm more of a champion now than
I ever was when I was actively fighting

932
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:09,090
and when I was, um, I was

933
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:10,910
okay

934
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:15,910
trying to be good enough
instead of just focusing on

935
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:25,190
how can I say, my, my,

936
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:30,860
my pursuit of world titles
wasn't, wasn't about it. It was a,

937
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,690
in a defense of something that was
told to me when I was growing up.

938
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:37,490
So it's like I'm world champion,

939
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:40,640
so you can't tell that's not true
cause I'm world champion. Right.

940
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:45,230
So that's what that was about for me.
Making up for a lack of love,

941
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:49,340
lack of appreciation or just abuse.
Yeah. Lack of like, I'm not good enough.

942
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:52,730
So I'm gonna win this world title
and prove that I am good enough.

943
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,650
So FSU and that's not a pure
place to express yourself from,

944
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,270
you know, like now, um,

945
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:05,420
I'm more of a martial artist than I've
ever been and I'm more of a teacher and a

946
01:00:05,421 --> 01:00:08,450
student than I've ever been in a more
of a champion than I've ever been.

947
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,130
How are you more of a champion
than you've ever been?

948
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:14,310
It's the way of my outlook and the way,
uh,

949
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:18,950
learn the way I attack new information,
the way how malleable I am.

950
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,710
Um,
how

951
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:27,050
quickly I take things
on, you know, how driven,

952
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,390
you know,
it's easy to be,

953
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:33,980
it's a lot easier to be champion when
you have the six pack and the muscles and

954
01:00:33,981 --> 01:00:36,710
the youth. And the
everything, the back that up.

955
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:41,000
But when you have those things taken
away from you, then what is the champion?

956
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:45,590
What does it without those things,
it's your hearts, your desire,

957
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:50,360
it's your resolve. It's your mind. We're
using this expression champion. Like what,

958
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:54,500
what, why, why champion? Because
you're, if you're a champion,

959
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:57,170
you're competing against
someone to become a champion.

960
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,820
That was a big event chance,
right?

961
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:05,240
So to do it better, to
learn it faster. Yeah.

962
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:10,270
Over the things that you feel held you
back and limited your potential when you

963
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,850
actually were a world champion.

964
01:01:11,851 --> 01:01:16,320
Kickboxer and so now it's
more about self expression.

965
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,260
You're more balanced
person. Yeah, definitely.

966
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:23,460
And now it's the pursuit of
self expression and as the
pursuit of authenticity,

967
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:24,870
um,

968
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:29,250
and like finding that moment to ride the
razor's edge instead of playing it safe

969
01:01:29,251 --> 01:01:32,850
and staying outside but not having
a satisfying fight. You know,

970
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:37,650
even though you won don having satisfying
fights because you could feel the

971
01:01:37,651 --> 01:01:41,430
flaws. Yeah. Well, I could just
feel how I was holding back.

972
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:44,460
And it's like you can feel when
you're in the zone and you go for it,

973
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:49,120
100% commitment and you, you're just in
it, you know, you're in, it would fights,

974
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:53,030
have you had where you
really felt satisfied? Uh,

975
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,640
I would say the fight after I
thought Julie. Yeah, she was,

976
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:05,690
I went up kitchen. Yeah. I went up
and wait to fight her. She, she um,

977
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:09,980
I went up to one 40. It was champion a
champion. She had 58 fights, I think.

978
01:02:09,981 --> 01:02:11,150
14 world titles.

979
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:16,510
I had 14 fights at the time
and six world titles I think.

980
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:21,510
And um, that's pretty crazy. 14
five, six world titles. Yeah.

981
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:26,640
Yeah. Karen said that you were the most
talented person he's ever worked with.

982
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:30,210
I would agree.
I would.

983
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:35,310
I would because it's so high praise.
What I noticed is,

984
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:38,790
I mean, that's really,
it's amazing stuff. Well,

985
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:43,830
I'm malleable and I'm really dry lake. I'm
like, no, that's not right. Do it again.

986
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,080
This doesn't feel right. Do it
again. What am I, what are you doing?

987
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:48,180
What am I doing? What does it look
like? What should it feel like?

988
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:51,840
Where's my pressure? Where's the leverage?
Was this, you know, like, I'm like,

989
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:57,270
I'm like that, you know? No,
it's not right. Let's do it
again. Oh, that was perfect.

990
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,440
But let's move on to the next thing.

991
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:03,390
And this sort of level of dissatisfaction.
When you performances though,

992
01:03:03,391 --> 01:03:06,930
don't you think that that's ultimately
what makes you such a champion in the

993
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:07,764
first place?
Like you,

994
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,340
Alexander Gustafson put it best once
when he was talking about one of his

995
01:03:11,341 --> 01:03:14,580
training camps, he's like, this is
the life of a professional athlete.

996
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:16,770
You're just never satisfied.
He says, if you achieve,

997
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:21,660
if you want to achieve greatness,
you're never satisfied. No, I agree,

998
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:25,050
but not with the way I was doing it.
So you were doing it,

999
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:28,140
but you were doing it and I'm manic,
almost unhealthy way.

1000
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,490
Like I could never just give myself that.
I never like, all right, that was great.

1001
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:37,230
This needs adjustments. All
right, so here's the game
plan. You know, like, Oh, here,

1002
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,430
you know, you did this, this is an
accomplishment. Uh, or you know, you,

1003
01:03:41,431 --> 01:03:44,550
you conquered this, you took
on this new scale. All right,

1004
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:48,720
let's give yourself that credit. Right.
It's never good enough. Never good enough.

1005
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:53,070
Never good enough. Never
good enough. You'll like,

1006
01:03:53,071 --> 01:03:56,580
is that thought like you'd
never good enough. Never
good enough. Definitely fuel.

1007
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:58,600
It is right, but it's not, there's,

1008
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:03,730
there's much more environmentally friendly
feel like this is like con pollutants

1009
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:09,870
pollutant and as far as your life
goes, yeah, I know what you mean.

1010
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:14,850
Yeah. Now, so, um, I am
working with, I am back at CSA,

1011
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:18,500
working with Korean, you
know, but I told him, um,

1012
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:20,121
for,

1013
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:24,900
from Moitai I actually
told Dave and Kurian this.

1014
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:29,400
I did well, I guess I'm telling him
no, if I were having a Thai fight,

1015
01:04:29,401 --> 01:04:31,620
obviously I'm not going
to, you know, I would,

1016
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:35,670
I wouldn't be with anybody else.
Like he's,

1017
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,520
that's where the success has been.
That's where the formula works.

1018
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:40,920
I'm not going to change that. But, um,

1019
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:45,930
now I'm also over at a gorilla
Jujitsu. Wait, Dave camera alone.

1020
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:50,950
And so, oh my God. Genius
home. Fucking Jedi Knight Dude.

1021
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,470
He's a Jedi Knight. Holy
Shit. Yeah. He's amazing.

1022
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:00,660
He's amazing. Um, but now I get
to learn from him and so that,

1023
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:05,160
um, does he make any where
g uh, he's not making me,

1024
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:11,030
but I, I do and I would and have no
problem with it. Um, he's definitely,

1025
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,330
he says like, I need to go to classes,
which I absolutely agree with, you know,

1026
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:17,740
as a high level striker or any kind of
Stryker going into m a you need to go to

1027
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:20,110
the fucking classes and learn
to swim in the deep end. Yeah.

1028
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:22,360
You have to and just be
like, all right, this sucks.

1029
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:27,100
I'm just getting like fucking armpit a
suffocated. It's fine. Just deal with it.

1030
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,960
Um,
but uh,

1031
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:34,620
with Dave I can feel myself changing
into the fighter that I want to be.

1032
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:40,450
How often are you doing Jujitsu? Um, well,

1033
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:42,580
right now I've been
traveling sometimes as much,

1034
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:45,580
but I was doing it like every day.
Yeah.

1035
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,720
And with your knee,

1036
01:05:46,721 --> 01:05:49,440
I know you have like a limited amount
of mobility with one of your name. Yeah.

1037
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:50,830
Yeah.
Is that getting in the way of anything?

1038
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,720
Um, it does definitely have to like
just put a brace on her or anything. No,

1039
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,320
I just uh, communicate clearly
with my training partners.

1040
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:02,550
So funny thing is I love heal hooks

1041
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:07,380
and I've had four knee surgeries.
Isn't that weird?

1042
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:12,660
It's a little weird. That's active as
fuck. That's the only submission I go for.

1043
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:17,070
Really. He'll hook knee bar. Well
listen, that's a very good submission.

1044
01:06:17,071 --> 01:06:21,180
I mean it's revolutionized Jujitsu
I alley over the last few years.

1045
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:23,700
The leg lock game is really taken over.

1046
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,910
Do you think it was like if somebody had
that many surgeries you'd be like, no,

1047
01:06:26,911 --> 01:06:28,540
I'm not fucking with that.
Well how about John?

1048
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,500
Actually I'm like getting in there.
John Donner as a fake hip.

1049
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:33,530
He's got a fake knee. Oh Wow. Really?

1050
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:38,540
His whole body's getting replaced and
he's one of the main minds at the head of

1051
01:06:39,571 --> 01:06:42,520
the leg lock revolution.
Eddie Commons being one of them and,

1052
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:45,990
and then a lot of the students, you
know, awesome. Gary tone of course.

1053
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:51,470
There's so many really good Jujitsu guys
now that are leg lock specialists fast

1054
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:56,480
and Craig Jones is like a whole new crew
of up and coming guys that are leg lock

1055
01:06:56,551 --> 01:06:59,600
specialists. I love it. Yeah,
it's really interesting.

1056
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:02,670
It's really interesting because
all the years that I did you Jitsu,

1057
01:07:02,671 --> 01:07:07,671
it took like this transition like which
only took place within the last decade,

1058
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:12,480
like less than a decade where it really
started ramping up back in the day.

1059
01:07:12,481 --> 01:07:13,370
If you did it,
you just,

1060
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:16,170
if you were in a Jujitsu tournament
and do the leg lock or a heel hook,

1061
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:19,770
the crowd would boo. They'd
fucking scream. They would scream.

1062
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:21,120
Even if you won by tap,

1063
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:23,550
like if you went to the worlds
and you heal hook somebody,

1064
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,820
people would freak the fuck
out. That's so dumb. It's crazy.

1065
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,570
That's what it used to be. It used to
be that they thought of it as cheap.

1066
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:33,600
They thought leg locks and
heal hooks and ankle locks.

1067
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:38,340
They thought those were cheap moves, but
it's literally part of the body. Well,

1068
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:42,240
it what it is is people that
didn't understand the defense,

1069
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:46,080
so they would move the wrong way and get
their legs blown apart and nobody wants

1070
01:07:46,081 --> 01:07:47,910
to get their legs blown
apart and training.

1071
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,760
So they would discourage it and training
and discourage it and competition

1072
01:07:50,761 --> 01:07:54,030
because it was ripping people's
legs apart. Retarded. Well,

1073
01:07:54,031 --> 01:07:59,031
it's just a lack of understanding what
your shoulder is a very complex joint.

1074
01:07:59,191 --> 01:08:02,560
We have zero problem manipulating
the shit out of people shoulders.

1075
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,960
It's a weak joint to make joint
terrorism complex and unique. Yeah. Yeah.

1076
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,330
And we have no problem with that.
Nobody.

1077
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:13,770
Nobody says we gotta outlaw right
about that. Yeah. Somehow or another,

1078
01:08:13,771 --> 01:08:17,510
if you fuck your shoulder up, you
can't wipe your ass. That's okay.

1079
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:20,880
But if you fuck your knee up,
we can't walk. Good carriage.

1080
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:23,150
If you can wipe your own ass,
well not a problem for you.

1081
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:28,090
Why over this with my super
toilet does toilets are awesome.

1082
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,470
I'm going to take a picture of that
and post that on Instagram. Go ahead.

1083
01:08:30,471 --> 01:08:33,940
Feel free. I tell people about them.
They're amazing. That's awesome.

1084
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:37,340
They keep it clean and pause.
It's comfy. It's like a warm seat.

1085
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:42,380
As soon as I sat down I was like, ah. Oh,
nice. Right. Oh yeah. That's a good life.

1086
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:47,060
That's good. This is the good life.
Yeah. Uh, it's weird. Like what? I mean,

1087
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,980
why is it okay to yank on someone's neck?
I mean,

1088
01:08:48,981 --> 01:08:51,170
I didn't know so many dudes with
fucked up next. And he's like,

1089
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,360
all of Jujitsu is bad for your body.

1090
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:59,240
The tingling going down my arm right
now when I sit in certain positions, oh,

1091
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:04,460
he's just wrestling and Jujitsu
never happened. No guarantee.

1092
01:09:04,461 --> 01:09:09,170
I know what that is. It's a pinched
nerve. Means you got a bulging disc. No,

1093
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:13,670
that's what it means. Not
all the time though. Almost
always. No. The tingling. Yeah.

1094
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:18,020
The tingling is called a nerve
is being pushed on by a disk.

1095
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:23,150
Yeah. Most of the time. That's what
that is. Until the wheels fall off.

1096
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,400
Yeah.
Well,

1097
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:31,580
but the wheels are not off. You
can strengthen things and, and,

1098
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:35,330
and you can do a lot of, have you ever
fucked around with spinal decompression?

1099
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:40,250
So a lot of really cool devices that you
could do at home. Just hang spot. Yeah.

1100
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:44,750
You put this harness on the straps to
the door and it like supports your head,

1101
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:49,220
like pulls on your neck, stretches and
relaxes your neck. Yeah, it's fantastic.

1102
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:51,260
Really good.
Yeah.

1103
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,840
That'll help a lot and sign
that. And then after, uh,

1104
01:09:56,510 --> 01:10:00,680
we have pieces of paper you could write
on your paper. Okay. I'll text it to you.

1105
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:06,680
I'll text you,
I'll text you all this stuff cause I'm,

1106
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:10,010
I'm a fanatic about helping people
with neck injuries because a,

1107
01:10:10,011 --> 01:10:13,550
I had a pretty significant bulging
discs that was making my hands numb.

1108
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:17,430
I was really worried and my elbow was
always in pain and I thought you're going

1109
01:10:17,431 --> 01:10:20,720
to damage my elbow. And it turned
out what was going on as the nerve.

1110
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:24,830
My disc was pushing as a nerve in
my neck and then the ulnar nerve,

1111
01:10:24,831 --> 01:10:27,200
which goes all the way down to
your pinkie tips of my fingers.

1112
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:28,960
It's like over here, right? Yeah. Yeah.

1113
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:32,600
That was hurting weird since I
broke my elbow in her head. Well,

1114
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:35,480
I'm sure it's all that inflammation
and scar tissue and shit,

1115
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,440
but um,
there's a bunch of different devices to,

1116
01:10:39,441 --> 01:10:42,410
there's a thing called the iron neck
that I love to talk to people about too.

1117
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:46,730
It's like a halo you put on those
help strengthen all this stuff too.

1118
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:51,710
Yeah. I'll show it to you after.
After, after dupont pull on my,

1119
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:56,480
I'm fine. I'm totally fine.
But wrestling like this

1120
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,620
head cranks cranks,

1121
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:05,060
even Jujitsu is not as
bad as wrestling for me.

1122
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:10,070
John John Machado always says, never trust
your neck. Just don't trust your neck.

1123
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,100
Never think you're next going to hold up.
Some guys like they'll shoot

1124
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:14,761
him for a take down.

1125
01:11:14,761 --> 01:11:17,630
Someone will get them in a gay teen and
I just try to gut through it out of it.

1126
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,790
Never Trust your neck, never
trust your neck. That sucks. Yeah,

1127
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:27,630
neck is a weird thing. There's little
bones that are held in place by tendons.

1128
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:32,460
And this gelatinous mush in between him
and in between is the fucking cord that

1129
01:11:32,461 --> 01:11:35,520
communicates from your brain all
the way down to all your limbs.

1130
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,100
And we're cranking on that thing.

1131
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:42,750
Like this is the housing for the cord
that keeps your body moving from your

1132
01:11:42,751 --> 01:11:46,500
brain and people are getting you
fucking chugs crushing your neck.

1133
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:50,760
It's crazy now. Now when I do
Jujitsu and whole different mindset,

1134
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:54,940
I'm really don't fucking touch my neck.
Yeah. Don't touch my neck. Don't make it.

1135
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,250
I'll sneak an elbow in there.

1136
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:03,210
Do you put your hair up and
buns and shit and like, yeah,

1137
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:04,140
I try,
but it's

1138
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:09,750
probably used to weld like lawn to,
you can pull it off.

1139
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:12,450
Itchy moms wanting to choose mine.

1140
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:17,110
I pull it off and should be done
it before you get a crew cut.

1141
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:20,830
He'd look up bad ass bitch
with a crew cut. Like,

1142
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:26,100
why not? Why not for a comeback
fight? Look in fucking,

1143
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,970
it's not a bad move. I'm already
four. He's here, you know,

1144
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:34,380
I got to at least keep some
kind of thing. Go take feminine.

1145
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,830
Hmm. Okay. So I'm getting the lines,

1146
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:42,020
I gotta at least try to rose
number units to the game.

1147
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:44,550
I think rose looks just as beautiful,

1148
01:12:44,551 --> 01:12:49,551
if not more beautiful is she
know if she was an actress,

1149
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:52,240
she looks like an a list actress,
doesn't she?

1150
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:57,560
She has that presence but she doesn't
give a fuck. Like she's so yeah.

1151
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:00,960
That's a big part of what it
is. So interesting. So present.

1152
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:07,400
Beautiful. She is beautiful but beautiful
person. Her heart and hurts. Yes.

1153
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:12,270
Yeah, yeah. No, she's amazing.
Yeah. Yeah. And um, they don't know.

1154
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:16,140
I don't think they appreciate that as
much. They don't appreciate it enough.

1155
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,240
You know,
like how gorgeous she is.

1156
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:22,050
Like she doesn't get enough
press or attention or if she had,

1157
01:13:22,051 --> 01:13:24,700
if she had her hair and
she played the game. Yeah.

1158
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,680
Cause she literally looks like a mini
supermodel with the little muscles.

1159
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,670
Like, yeah. Well I remember when
she fought Michelle Waterson,

1160
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:36,720
the karate hottie everybody's making
this big deal out of how hot Michelle

1161
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:36,850
Waterson is,

1162
01:13:36,850 --> 01:13:41,850
who's very beautiful but so's rose
Rose's equally gorgeous if not more.

1163
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:43,260
The look,
the,

1164
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:48,000
it's a different type of
look like Michelle Waterson
would be like a hosting a

1165
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:52,170
cable entertainment show,
ie news or something. Right.

1166
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,910
And rose not Munis would be like
the lead in a, in a movie. Right.

1167
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:01,020
That's the difference in beauty. She just
has this like, interesting look to her.

1168
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:05,170
She has this kind of like a
challenging beauty, you know? Yeah.

1169
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:09,570
And it's even her expression. Yeah.
We're, we're Michelle Waterson is,

1170
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,980
there's something much more
comfortable about her beauty. Like

1171
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,570
she's really exotic. She's like tie and
white or something. Right. Okay. Yeah.

1172
01:14:16,571 --> 01:14:19,480
She's gorgeous. But she, she's
doesn't have as something,

1173
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:23,770
she hasn't had that challenging
thing. Do you know what I mean? Yeah.

1174
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:32,460
I wouldn't look nowhere near as good as
rose, so. Well, that's very nice. Um,

1175
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,560
so what kind of physical conditioning
do you do if you don't do any iron?

1176
01:14:35,561 --> 01:14:39,250
Next stuff? No, spinal
decompression. What do you do? Um,

1177
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:43,900
I was doing a bit of crossfit and
a bit of, um, just fight training

1178
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:50,560
as, so I've been out so long when I
started to get, be getting back in.

1179
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:52,570
Like I told you before we started,

1180
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:57,190
I went fucking crazy and that
was a bad idea at 41 at the time,

1181
01:14:57,191 --> 01:15:00,640
it was last year and I had a total body
breakdown where it hurts a full hold my

1182
01:15:00,641 --> 01:15:05,020
cell phone. I like burning pain in my
forearms, just holding my cell phone.

1183
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:07,530
How long did it take you to
get to that spot? That spot?

1184
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:12,220
About four months of hard.
Yeah. Like doing Jujitsu.

1185
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,270
So I was over at half, Gracie
in San Francisco and I was
doing legs a hard spot.

1186
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,480
Sometimes I do fuck around.
I know Kurt ender. Yeah.

1187
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:24,920
Whenever I talked to somebody that
trained in house, I'll go, Ooh, yeah.

1188
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:29,050
Fucking you swam with the sharks?
Yeah, I did. I did. Um, but it was,

1189
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:33,280
how come you don't have Kurt on? He, he,

1190
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,700
he called me. He's just like that in
person. Oh, I'm sure. It's just like that.

1191
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:41,680
We're both friends with Bordain. I just
never got to meet for Dane was alive.

1192
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:47,350
I'm sorry about that. Um, he
collects a medieval weapons

1193
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,580
and he'll shoot them.

1194
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:56,670
I love how we fucking takes videos where
you just see his feet and his feet,

1195
01:15:57,241 --> 01:16:02,160
those toes or isn't gnarled tape. They
seen his fingers. Yeah, there are a mess.

1196
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:04,120
Yeah. Yeah. Well those gay guys, man,

1197
01:16:04,121 --> 01:16:07,640
they just damaged the shit out of their
fingers. I keep telling Kurt his big toe,

1198
01:16:07,641 --> 01:16:12,610
it looks like a, like one of those
dildos in the Castro. Like it looks like,

1199
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:17,320
yeah, it looks like a, like a butt
plug. All those in the Castro.

1200
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:21,040
Oh those,
it looks like a butt plug.

1201
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:26,380
It's the like that big walls.
Old Guys,

1202
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:29,880
their hands just turn into a gnarled
messes. It looks as though always trapped.

1203
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:32,020
He looks like a mountain troll.
Little bit.

1204
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,700
I love that guy is an animal. He
said, what else does he do? Yeah.

1205
01:16:37,701 --> 01:16:41,920
And he's a great cook is
too. And then also, um,

1206
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:46,180
fuck. What does he do? Was he in
a band? He does a lot of acid.

1207
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:49,420
He was in a band and he
like buys instruments.

1208
01:16:49,421 --> 01:16:51,220
It's like I'm gonna
learn how to play this.

1209
01:16:51,221 --> 01:16:54,820
And then he's like building
additions onto his house.

1210
01:16:54,821 --> 01:16:59,260
And did you start his own school
recently? Yes. That, okay.

1211
01:16:59,261 --> 01:17:03,280
That whole transition, that was
like game of Thrones. Oh really?

1212
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:08,260
I don't know any quiz. I'm not,
I don't know that much about it.

1213
01:17:08,261 --> 01:17:10,130
I just remember like everybody

1214
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,760
had little groups and was like, who are
you with? And it was just like, yeah,

1215
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:17,180
I'm not really used to that. And
Moy, Tai, we don't, it's not as,

1216
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:21,830
I mean there's some of it, but not like
that. And it's happening many times.

1217
01:17:21,831 --> 01:17:26,480
There's been many foldings and
unfolding. Are you with me, my brothers,

1218
01:17:26,481 --> 01:17:30,720
and I'm just like, ah, oh no.
I'm with myself. I'm just,

1219
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,950
I'm just a blue belt. I want just a
12 year old blue blue belt over here.

1220
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:36,130
You know? Like, I don't
really care how, I guess I,

1221
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:39,680
I understand it because it really popular
school can be incredibly lucrative.

1222
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:42,080
You know,
there's so many schools.

1223
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:45,740
That's one of the weird things about
California that people like people that

1224
01:17:45,741 --> 01:17:49,190
live in places without a lot of Jujitsu,
they would go crazy here.

1225
01:17:49,191 --> 01:17:52,460
They wouldn't know where to go
within this. Where we are right now.

1226
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:56,330
We could drive in three minutes
and go to five Jujitsu places.

1227
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,510
I needed you to recommend some firmware
for me to train. I'm down here,

1228
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:03,870
I'll get you a bunch of places. But
I mean we're in the valley, but I,

1229
01:18:03,871 --> 01:18:06,520
I could tell you there's a place in
it and see knows a place over here in

1230
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:09,950
Woodland Hills has a place in Canoga Park.
There's a place over there.

1231
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:14,120
It's a place over here. You can go further
out. I didn't even, they're everywhere.

1232
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:15,050
Think about that.
Yeah.

1233
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:18,050
Like being in an area
where there's no Jujitsu.

1234
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,840
Oh there's places.
Yeah.

1235
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:23,440
I mean one of the things when Bordain
was really getting into Jujitsu,

1236
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:27,800
he was training every day even
on the road. So he travels, he,

1237
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:31,610
well sometimes it's easy. It's hard when
you're a celebrity. Oh boy. Yeah. Yeah.

1238
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:35,180
He would send me text messages about
it. Shit. Now bone fragments cause too,

1239
01:18:35,181 --> 01:18:37,720
it's just be smashing him cause you know,

1240
01:18:37,721 --> 01:18:41,620
they will sort of make an example out
of some celebrity guy who wants to learn

1241
01:18:41,621 --> 01:18:46,540
Jujitsu, crushing him. But
you know, he would go to,

1242
01:18:46,541 --> 01:18:49,840
like when he was in Bozeman, when he was
in Montana, there was no Jujitsu there,

1243
01:18:49,841 --> 01:18:51,640
so he had to go to like a club,

1244
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,860
I think it was in billings
or something like that.

1245
01:18:53,861 --> 01:18:57,820
So He'd travel to where they did this
club and it was just a bunch of like

1246
01:18:57,821 --> 01:19:00,970
enthusiasts. They would get together.
It wasn't even like real teaching.

1247
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:04,290
That's great. You know? And he
would train with them, play like a,

1248
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:07,750
they have a TV with the video
up and they worked the move.

1249
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:11,170
If you have a good good
video and a good athlete you,

1250
01:19:11,171 --> 01:19:16,000
you can learn something from that can do
attitude, a little bit of elbow grease,

1251
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:20,650
a little bit of that man. I think there's
never been a better time to do that.

1252
01:19:20,651 --> 01:19:24,040
Then now with all the youtube videos,
it's really an incredible time.

1253
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:27,340
Even if you're not in a place with a
really good Jujitsu, you can learn,

1254
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:31,680
but you can definitely find something that
you really need someone to go, no, no.

1255
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:34,240
I hear now go like this. And you look, oh,

1256
01:19:34,241 --> 01:19:38,020
just a little subtle adjustments that
someone knows from years and years and

1257
01:19:38,021 --> 01:19:42,760
years of training. It's all about
the sensitivity of leverage. Yeah.

1258
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,320
It's just that sweet spot.

1259
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:46,783
The Thai clinch.

1260
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:50,120
It's just that like that little difference
if like when they putting the elbows

1261
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:54,080
into like right in here and write
like pulling into that little,

1262
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:58,790
that little hook area right behind
your head there. Yeah. I was working,

1263
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:03,740
I'm helping some of the MMA guys at
gorilla with their Thai clinch and the one

1264
01:20:03,741 --> 01:20:07,980
of the wrestlers was grabbing up there
and grabbed the back of your head and it

1265
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,140
kind of looks like they're gonna make out.
And

1266
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:15,750
I try not to laugh, but
it's hard. It's, I'm sure.

1267
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:21,000
I'm sure they want to laugh at me that
way. I did it. I did realize that,

1268
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:26,340
oh, it's okay. Don't kiss him. Yeah.
Maybe later. This is not right now.

1269
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:30,660
That is such an underutilized
a technique. You know, the,

1270
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:35,130
a good plum, someone with a good
Moy Thai clinch. Yeah. I mean when,

1271
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:38,030
if you haven't felt it before when
someone can really grow. Like,

1272
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:40,350
I remember when Anderson
Silva fought rich Franklin.

1273
01:20:40,351 --> 01:20:42,450
Rich Franklin just did not
know what to do with it. Yes.

1274
01:20:42,451 --> 01:20:46,830
Anderson grabbed a hold of it and just
start smashing it and you realize like

1275
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:51,831
the fucking clench the way he would do
to so locked down yet such technique.

1276
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:53,130
Right.

1277
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:58,130
You know what's funny to me as a Muy
Thai world champion or ex Muy Thai world

1278
01:20:58,381 --> 01:21:00,870
champion is that I watched
these things and I go through,

1279
01:21:00,871 --> 01:21:04,440
that's so fucking easy to neutralize. It
gets a little bit like you just, yeah,

1280
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,030
just going to, you know, go like this
and what to do or you just like, it's,

1281
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:11,280
you don't have to be in that situation.
It didn't know what to do. Yeah. Yeah.

1282
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:16,070
But I mean to this day there's still
fights that I'll watch in the UFC where

1283
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,650
I'll see their grappling and I'll just
go, Jesus fucking Christ. Get your foot.

1284
01:21:19,651 --> 01:21:23,730
What are you doing? Good.
Yeah. This is white belt stuff.

1285
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,510
This is blue belt stuff surprises me
when I watch that. Cause I think like,

1286
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,710
you know,
what do I know?

1287
01:21:28,711 --> 01:21:32,040
I'm in like a high level striker if I
don't like because you don't fucking know

1288
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:34,500
this and you're in the UFC.
You don't fucking know this.

1289
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:36,480
How do you not fucking know this?
It's you.

1290
01:21:36,481 --> 01:21:39,480
You're dealing with people that
come from all over the world. Right?

1291
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,070
Like when Francis and gone, oh, fought
steep Emile chick for the title. Right.

1292
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:47,950
Literally didn't is really recent, but
have you ever want to watch that again?

1293
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:52,080
Yeah. It was rough to watch
ever. Yeah, I have terrible.

1294
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:55,760
I don't really like watching heavyweight
fight that much. Why is that? Uh,

1295
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:59,880
it's a little too slow. It's usually
not as technical. That's true.

1296
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:04,170
But when they land, yeah, I know,

1297
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:07,460
but I mean you can get people that are
smaller and more technical and faster and

1298
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,530
they can land heavy punches too.
That's true.

1299
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:14,730
But maybe cause you're there live so
you can feel the ground shake or me,

1300
01:22:14,731 --> 01:22:16,920
I'm just watching on the
TV so I don't feel it.

1301
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:21,490
Did you see when Francis knocked
out Alistair Overeem? I think I did.

1302
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,010
Yeah.

1303
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:26,650
If you need to see it again and then you
need to see that again because this is

1304
01:22:26,651 --> 01:22:31,330
something that, this is some life.
Change my life. Watch this. Boom.

1305
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:37,580
Yeah, watch this. I know
this boy, this left tour,

1306
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,980
but it's crazy that I know.

1307
01:22:41,981 --> 01:22:46,110
So scary and his striking is so
dangerous that even Allister,

1308
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:50,400
a guy who's been around forever,
he fought so wild and open.

1309
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:52,560
His hands were down.
Yeah.

1310
01:22:52,561 --> 01:22:55,020
Where was his head movement and
where was his head movement? I mean,

1311
01:22:55,021 --> 01:22:58,110
he was moved a little bit in the beginning
of the consequences are so scary.

1312
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:01,160
Yeah. Very little head movement.
Head movement. Have very little know.

1313
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:05,890
Some guys are picking up more tattoo.
Yeah, no, especially Maurice. I know him.

1314
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:10,450
Straight center line. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well,

1315
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:15,120
when I think guys like Simon Marcus start
working with Floyd Mayweather senior

1316
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:17,980
and then other, when do you start
working with them? I don't know.

1317
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:20,680
How long has he been with? I know. I don't
know. I just watch videos on the line.

1318
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:27,040
Simon Marcus, number one on
the improvements. I'm sure
he's improving, but I dunno.

1319
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:32,020
He's still pretty young. I mean, Simon is
only like 30 Simon Marcus, number one on,

1320
01:23:32,021 --> 01:23:36,480
um, Instagram. I think the real
problem with Moy Tai and, uh,

1321
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:41,490
even with kickboxing is just a lack of
promotion and a lack of understanding

1322
01:23:42,011 --> 01:23:46,030
from the general public. To me, I get
very excited whenever a Gloria van is ana.

1323
01:23:46,031 --> 01:23:49,930
Here he is. Whenever a Gloria
van is on gimme a little zeroes.

1324
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,870
It's been an amazing year as an honor
and pleasure to be able to work with

1325
01:23:52,871 --> 01:23:56,770
boxing legend Floyd Mayweather,
Sr four left at Jimmy said, kid,

1326
01:23:56,771 --> 01:24:01,510
you're going to be all right. It looks
good there, you know, but I mean,

1327
01:24:01,511 --> 01:24:06,070
you're talking about a guy with just a
tremendous amount of understanding of

1328
01:24:06,071 --> 01:24:09,250
boxing. Do you ever see when he
fought sugar ray Leonard Bending

1329
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:14,070
his, uh, uh, uh, he's bending his
legs. Finally. Simon Marcus, right?

1330
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:18,840
Oh, he's shifting his weight to, as
opposed to like the Moitai style. Yeah.

1331
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:23,090
It's hard for him though. [inaudible]
Eco. It's, it's not like a,

1332
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:28,600
it's not and easy. It's
like, yeah, but he's,

1333
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:30,520
it's hard for him to rotate.

1334
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:33,510
Yeah.
Isn't it interesting because yeah,

1335
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:37,360
he's a world champion and
he's a devastating striker
and he just fucked a lot of

1336
01:24:37,361 --> 01:24:38,194
people up.

1337
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:43,150
But the limitations of the style that he
imposes and the way, the way he does it,

1338
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:47,380
when he's trying to learn a different,
more smooth way of doing things,

1339
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:48,730
you see that the stiffness.

1340
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:50,680
So in, uh, the boxing,

1341
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:55,330
they generate that power from the feet
and the like, the rotating and the,

1342
01:24:55,331 --> 01:24:58,260
you know what I mean? Like kind of
like a gas pedal and a brake, right?

1343
01:24:58,270 --> 01:25:02,210
You're like, ah, ah, and white tie.
It's not like that. When they punched,

1344
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,080
they're like, mm, mm mm.

1345
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,290
When you say say it, like explain it,
explain it for people just listening.

1346
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:11,430
Cause that's about half the crowd. Sorry.
Um hmm. They're like, what the fuck?

1347
01:25:13,850 --> 01:25:16,840
Um,
like for instance,

1348
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:21,040
the rear foot would be the gas and
then the front foot would be the brake.

1349
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:23,500
So you hit the gas and you're
going to go into the sprint.

1350
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:26,860
But as soon as you start getting the
velocity for the sprint and you Bam,

1351
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:31,360
put the breakdown. And then
with that, um, counter, um,

1352
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:35,320
uh,
the contradiction or the opposing forces,

1353
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:41,160
it erupts out the top in from your arms
and your fists into a powerful punch.

1354
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:44,480
And I think with Moitai,

1355
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:48,040
they just like step forward instead
of rotating from their tours,

1356
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:50,410
from anything from their
feet and their torso.

1357
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:53,950
Is there a benefit to that or does
it compliment the style of kicking?

1358
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:56,290
A probably more complementing
the style of kicking,

1359
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:59,890
but I think that if you move your,

1360
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:04,250
if you allow for rotation your punches,
you allow

1361
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,280
for the rotation in your feet so you can
generate more power and your punches.

1362
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:12,550
You can still then take the necessary
step out at an angle and then,

1363
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:16,850
um, and then stepping high with
your feet and get a great kick too.

1364
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:20,760
Like you just, you can, you can have both.
You can have the best of both worlds.

1365
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:25,250
Think combines the two things the
best. Oh, I love protrusion. Trojans.

1366
01:26:25,251 --> 01:26:26,084
One of the best armor.

1367
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:32,440
He's amazing to watch. Protrusion
versus Andy Sour. Yeah.

1368
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,060
Emma Asados face.
Yeah.

1369
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:40,450
I think it's about time.
It's like get the fuck out this sport.

1370
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:42,770
The fuck it was so good.

1371
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:47,360
Well Petrosian stills at the top of
the game because they were women.

1372
01:26:47,361 --> 01:26:52,160
He hears these a Ben 10,
but he lost to Andy wristy.

1373
01:26:52,161 --> 01:26:57,000
Right. Was it Andy [inaudible] him.
How, what I have, that's another kid.

1374
01:26:57,020 --> 01:27:00,560
Now I, I will, I want to deal with
paper, but I need to see this.

1375
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,460
Giorgio patrol geans um,
Instagram risk.

1376
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,930
Is this where you got coyote or is
this a the sour fights? This our fight,

1377
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:12,470
it was a sour fund. He was so young
here. Wow. I might not be in wristy.

1378
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:16,430
See you can't Google it while you're
doing this. Kenya. I go, that's what,

1379
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:19,310
we'll get to that afterwards.
But yeah, I like so sour.

1380
01:27:19,311 --> 01:27:22,660
Had this cut under his white.
Yeah.

1381
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:25,910
And then it kind of goes like bleeding
a little bit. And then in his eye,

1382
01:27:25,911 --> 01:27:27,350
and this is assumptive on my part,

1383
01:27:27,351 --> 01:27:30,710
but in his eyes when you look at him
like interacting with the doctorate,

1384
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:34,280
it looks like I, yeah, yeah. It's bad.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what I mean?

1385
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,860
Like why you'll,
it's further down in the fight,

1386
01:27:36,861 --> 01:27:41,660
but Giorgio is so technical and one of
the more interesting things to me with

1387
01:27:41,661 --> 01:27:46,110
Giorgio was watching him train because
a lot of it is drilling. I mean,

1388
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:48,020
they do so much drilling.
Well,

1389
01:27:48,021 --> 01:27:51,280
that makes sense because you then
you can get out of the way. Well,

1390
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:56,210
he knows exactly what to do is his brain
and his mind or in sync with what to do

1391
01:27:56,211 --> 01:27:59,430
in the middle of a furious battle so
that he doesn't have to think too much.

1392
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,570
See that massage was excited. He's like,
yeah, I'm excited. This is exciting.

1393
01:28:02,571 --> 01:28:07,280
What's going to happen? Not towards
the end. That was fucking horses.

1394
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:12,170
Yeah. Yeah. Once it starts
awesome. Kay. It's fucking amazing.

1395
01:28:12,171 --> 01:28:13,004
I just,

1396
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:18,040
I just wished that kickboxing got more
press and more excitement in America

1397
01:28:18,591 --> 01:28:20,660
because I think it's more
exciting than boxing.

1398
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:24,710
If there's more to look at you
and you're seeing with, um,

1399
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:28,640
American champions, you, you're
seeing fantastic knockouts.

1400
01:28:28,641 --> 01:28:30,560
You see an amazing wins.
I mean,

1401
01:28:30,561 --> 01:28:34,480
the only one who's really doing all
the sports at a high level as Gastrin,

1402
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,310
gastrin belong,
look at his face now.

1403
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:43,820
This is after the first round.
Yeah. He's like, Oh shit, what time?

1404
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:48,440
When does this go to the
distance? Um, yeah, I think, yeah,

1405
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:52,580
go get into like the end rounds when
patrols you and really starts tuning them

1406
01:28:52,581 --> 01:28:52,980
up.

1407
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:57,080
It's so interesting because he would
just sort of find out where your openings

1408
01:28:57,081 --> 01:28:59,090
were,
where the rhythm was,

1409
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:02,040
where to move and we're not to
move and you're making mistakes

1410
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,140
and like a computer when you do it,

1411
01:29:04,141 --> 01:29:08,700
you just see him plug in the techniques
to fill those holes and you'd see like

1412
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:11,190
the little subtle steps and you know,

1413
01:29:11,610 --> 01:29:15,450
he always knows what you're going to
throw next or where you're going to be or

1414
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:19,710
what you're going to do. And you know,
he's so amazing and there's the cut.

1415
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:23,760
He was one of the best ever for sure.
And just an interesting guy to watch.

1416
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:28,200
He does. He's doesn't look like he's
doing much like of that. That was,

1417
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:31,340
he barely moved. Right.
Doesn't like doing much.

1418
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:36,570
But uh, press housing is just
right there. He's barely moving.

1419
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,740
Just moving. Just enough.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1420
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:46,140
Somebody k owed him in glory. And like I
said, I think it's Andy wristy pull up.

1421
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:50,640
Uh, I need to see that Giorgio
Petrosian record. I'm like,

1422
01:29:50,641 --> 01:29:52,830
what? Yeah. It was pretty shocking.

1423
01:29:52,831 --> 01:29:55,230
And it was in the big
Madison Square Garden debut.

1424
01:29:55,231 --> 01:29:57,790
They were in the theater at
Madison Square Garden. Yeah.

1425
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:02,440
Just take lanky power of power.
Stryker think it was rusty.

1426
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,770
Is it rusty?
It was.

1427
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:09,090
He has fucking hard and he caught
Giorgio and boom, the lights went out.

1428
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:13,860
Yeah. First round too. Yeah,
it was crazy. And again,

1429
01:30:13,861 --> 01:30:18,510
this was like glory had seriously hyped
up the fact that Georgia Petrolia is

1430
01:30:18,511 --> 01:30:22,800
like one of the best ever and
undefeated fantastic record.

1431
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:25,020
And uh,
Andy Rusty,

1432
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:28,650
maybe it was the beard. I don't think
it was, I think he just got clipped

1433
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:32,190
and maybe it was also a lot
of pressure. Right. You know,

1434
01:30:32,191 --> 01:30:35,370
fighting in Madison Square Garden,
fighting on in Glory, glory,

1435
01:30:35,371 --> 01:30:38,670
putting all this stuff behind him.
And you know, the thing is too,

1436
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:42,450
nobody ever knows what the fuck is going
on with a fighter when they're coming

1437
01:30:42,451 --> 01:30:46,350
into a fight. Right. You could be dealing
with injuries, sickness, training camp,

1438
01:30:46,351 --> 01:30:48,900
bad weight cut girlfriend.

1439
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:52,510
I was talking to a friend of mine and
they were talking about how they were

1440
01:30:52,511 --> 01:30:56,110
dealing with their coach. Um, drug youth.

1441
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,830
Their coach had a drug problem and they
weren't there for them for the fight.

1442
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:04,690
And so they went into a world
title defense like that.

1443
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:09,280
She said it wasn't the first round I was
wrong cause it looks like here we are

1444
01:31:09,281 --> 01:31:12,970
on the second or third. This is
the third, there's or the third.

1445
01:31:12,971 --> 01:31:17,230
So it was in the third round.
My memory's not that good. See

1446
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:22,300
it's guy just made it a brawl.
Yes. Well he just made it ugly.

1447
01:31:22,301 --> 01:31:25,570
He's like no respect.
He also fucking hit super hard.

1448
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:28,910
That's a part of the problem is it's
surprising because Patricia patrician

1449
01:31:28,911 --> 01:31:33,280
usually it doesn't get
entangled like this. You know,
he's really good at keeping,

1450
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:36,310
oh, can we say that again? Or
they'll play it again. They,

1451
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:40,260
he's really good at damn
uptown keeping space. Yeah.

1452
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,940
He's really good at maintaining
a good range for himself.

1453
01:31:42,941 --> 01:31:44,540
But he's getting all the tangled up here.
Yeah.

1454
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:47,410
I wonder what he thinks about this fight.
I would love to hear it.

1455
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:50,550
I would love to hear like what was wrong.
Like what,

1456
01:31:50,690 --> 01:31:54,660
what leading up to this fight
speaks Italian cause translate.

1457
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:59,690
Oh fuck. It's done that
before with Yoel Romero. I,

1458
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:04,630
Joey Diaz translate for Yoel Romero.
That's why I'm like it or not.

1459
01:32:04,631 --> 01:32:08,570
This is the 44th 40 year olds,
uh,

1460
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:13,390
not on steroids. Jammed full of
Jesus. Yeah. I like it or not.

1461
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:19,090
I mean, and they're like, this is
amazing. He's a genetic freak. Yeah.

1462
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:22,150
But you know, he was on the
podcast. He was talking about
it. He's like, go to Cuba.

1463
01:32:22,151 --> 01:32:25,330
He goes like, everybody looks like me.
He's like this fucking genes down there.

1464
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:26,980
But it kind of makes sense.
You know,

1465
01:32:26,981 --> 01:32:31,420
I mean the slave trade led to all
these like reading and not just that,

1466
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:35,200
but also high level athletic pursuits,
right? Because they're just there.

1467
01:32:35,201 --> 01:32:39,700
They put so much emphasis on athletes
and so much emphasis on, you know,

1468
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:42,880
they probably have an athlete's
fuck. Other athletes, you know,

1469
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:45,700
I mean if you get Serena Williams
and Lebron James to have a kid,

1470
01:32:45,701 --> 01:32:48,280
what are the odds that kid's
not a bad mother fucker.

1471
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:53,020
It's 0% right. The kid
would be a beast, right?

1472
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:57,130
It'd be a super athlete, seller
egg or the sperm cell, everything.

1473
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:01,570
So it all put it together, combine it
and mix it up. I'd love to see that.

1474
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:06,280
You imagine if like two super
athletes just decided like,
hey baby, I got an idea.

1475
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:10,330
Like let's just find out. We can get
along. Yeah, let's just make a kid.

1476
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:14,200
Or like not even, not even like a,
you know, hey baby. Just like, hey,

1477
01:33:14,201 --> 01:33:16,580
you want to just do a thing? It's
like eating. Then you'll just do it.

1478
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:19,120
You care of me not fuck it
up. Yeah. That's the thing.

1479
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:22,660
But they like a certain contract.
Yes. But here's the thing,

1480
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,180
and this I wanted to talk to you about,
cause I know you had a rough childhood.

1481
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:30,130
The reality is a certain amount of fucking
you up gives you a certain amount of

1482
01:33:30,131 --> 01:33:35,080
fuel that allows you to accomplish things
that a person with a cushy life and

1483
01:33:35,081 --> 01:33:38,920
always had a warm bed and always had
plenty of love. They, there's like a,

1484
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:41,650
you have a good sure.
Right? For sure. Yeah.

1485
01:33:41,651 --> 01:33:46,651
You have a gear that someone who lived a
wonderful life with perfect environment

1486
01:33:46,751 --> 01:33:51,220
and perfect upbringing probably doesn't
have, it's more like like, okay,

1487
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:55,030
I'll do it alone. Yeah. Like, oh,
okay. Right. But it's also the,

1488
01:33:55,031 --> 01:33:56,590
the need to do it alone.

1489
01:33:58,530 --> 01:34:02,010
The need to prove people, the
need to show people. Yeah.

1490
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:06,210
You know? Yeah. Yeah. For sure.

1491
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:09,990
Everybody I know that's interesting.
Had a fucked up childhood. Filey Yup.

1492
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:15,390
I don't know anybody that didn't you
too. Yeah. Really. Sure, Huh? Yeah.

1493
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,860
I haven't talked to my dad's. It's all
seven. He's alive. He's got the same name.

1494
01:34:19,861 --> 01:34:24,630
So cuddly and not bitter woman. Nice
person. And I have a lot of Nice friends.

1495
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:26,730
Yeah. But I've, I've cultivated this,

1496
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:30,570
this is something that I've
actively cultivated for decades.

1497
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:33,850
We have worked really hard
to be a nice person. Yeah.

1498
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:36,030
And I know the benefit
of being a nice person,

1499
01:34:36,031 --> 01:34:38,250
like how it makes me feel and
how it makes other people feel.

1500
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:42,240
And I know that that spreads and it
makes other people nicer. And I try,

1501
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:46,110
I work on it hard to
keep the wolf in a cage.

1502
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:50,130
Always let out sometimes.
Sometimes. It's a lot of times.

1503
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:54,420
I remember one time when you and I were
at a Moitai event together, um, uh,

1504
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,190
you were there and I ran into you there.

1505
01:34:56,191 --> 01:35:01,100
And it's funny watching fights
with you because, uh, you,

1506
01:35:01,101 --> 01:35:05,270
you were, and you were, you were like
gritting your teeth and you were like,

1507
01:35:05,271 --> 01:35:07,460
and then you looked over me. He
goes, don't you don't even want it.

1508
01:35:07,461 --> 01:35:09,170
Don't you want to just fuck somebody up?

1509
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:12,550
Don't you want to just smash some weights
fucking face? They're like, damn, Miriam,

1510
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:14,270
I gotta get the fuck away from me.

1511
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,570
When was this?
It was a long time ago in la.

1512
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:22,970
Remember la had that pro
Moitai thing where, um,

1513
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:28,070
uh, who fought a bull cow FOBT. Um,

1514
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:29,300
there was some good,
it was a good one.

1515
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:33,270
Oh my God. So you know what that
was? It was Moitai League. Yes.

1516
01:35:33,271 --> 01:35:37,560
So you know what it was, uh,
I had an ACL surgery. Right.

1517
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:40,480
And I couldn't fight. That's right.
And I was supposed to fight. Right.

1518
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,390
I was seizing, seizing, walking,

1519
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:51,330
and I was watching these fights and
they were fucking garbage and I couldn't

1520
01:35:51,331 --> 01:35:56,040
fight. Yeah. Yeah. That was 2000. Oh,
I remember that. Yeah. God dammit.

1521
01:35:56,430 --> 01:36:00,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was like, oh, it
would be these pitches. I really would

1522
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:05,020
wish that event took off. Cause that
was fun. It was great having that in La.

1523
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:08,290
Ernesto hoose was doing the
commentary as well. And um,

1524
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:13,460
yeah, Ben didn't volunteer to fight
in that. I think she did. I would be,

1525
01:36:13,461 --> 01:36:16,690
had been very curious to
see how a Valentino versus
Julie Kitchen want to turn

1526
01:36:16,691 --> 01:36:21,500
out. Mm. Yeah. Well I'm interesting.

1527
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:26,450
I'm really curious to see how she
does in the UFC at 125 pounds.

1528
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:29,480
She's a beast because she's going to be
strong at that. Wait, that's her weight.

1529
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:33,350
She's not a one 35 right. You see
how like she looks like fighter fit,

1530
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:35,530
like lean and cut ripped.

1531
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:39,590
Like even her legs when she was one
35 her legs look soft, you know?

1532
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:43,640
And she was still winning. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. She dropped Holly Holm. Yeah.

1533
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,560
That's crazy. I mean, she's Holly Holmes
like one 45 or probably, you know, like,

1534
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:52,220
well she comfortably,
comfortably we at one 45 it's not like,

1535
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:56,600
oh they're going a one 35 are going up
to one 45 she was like a big ass one 30

1536
01:36:56,720 --> 01:37:01,310
Fiverr and she went the
distance with Cyborg. Yeah.
At one 45 which is a fucking,

1537
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:05,030
that's a statement in and of itself.
Well, it's just the boxer. Yeah.

1538
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:08,810
So they're used to getting it
different. Yeah. Yeah. You know?

1539
01:37:09,410 --> 01:37:09,681
Yeah.

1540
01:37:09,681 --> 01:37:14,160
And I think she got fucked in the title
fight when she fought a Durand to me.

1541
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:16,640
I thought she should have won
that fight for sure. I do.

1542
01:37:16,641 --> 01:37:19,370
And I think the cheap shot, the
cheap shot to sheep, cheap shots,

1543
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,570
two of them after the bell,

1544
01:37:20,571 --> 01:37:23,540
one of them that significantly hurt her
and I think parents should have been

1545
01:37:23,541 --> 01:37:25,820
taken away for sure.
Yup. Yup, Yup, Yup. Yeah.

1546
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:31,140
It's crazy sport. Holly Holmes,
amazing. She is as a person,

1547
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:34,170
I've never met her,
but she seems nice person ever.

1548
01:37:34,171 --> 01:37:38,670
She seems really sweet and she just seems
like I was listening to her interviews,

1549
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:39,810
you know,
it's just,

1550
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:43,980
she seems just like a really uplifted,

1551
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:49,410
genuine person, know a
super humble, you know,

1552
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:52,080
she really is,
which is one of the weirder moments.

1553
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:55,980
Why was such a weird moment
rather when Ronda Rousey at

1554
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,430
the Wayans was like, you fucking
bitch yourself. You're a fucking fake.

1555
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:03,030
And it was weird. It
was like, where's this?

1556
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:07,230
It was like almost like she wanted her
to be the enemy so that she get amped up

1557
01:38:07,231 --> 01:38:10,500
to kick her ass. So sue sang a bunch
of things. It didn't even make sense.

1558
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,930
Maybe even Rhonda was kind
of at a breaking point too,

1559
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:17,220
just as far as like
workload, stress, level, um,

1560
01:38:17,221 --> 01:38:20,430
expectations, you know, obligations.

1561
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:23,250
And when I saw that way in,
actually I,

1562
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:27,270
I've watched that probably at least five
times. Like I just replayed it and like,

1563
01:38:27,271 --> 01:38:31,890
cause I like to watch people
interact and how they react.

1564
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:36,900
I love it. Yeah. And I noticed
like when I saw that, I'm like, oh,

1565
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:42,480
Holly's got this and I wish I'd fucking
bet buddy. It's totally, wish I did.

1566
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:44,520
But now I was watching and I was like,
oh,

1567
01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:47,670
just stop because Ron Ron
to seem so emotional. Um,

1568
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:52,400
it was the way Holly reacted.
That's why mm.

1569
01:38:53,170 --> 01:38:55,980
She's just,
she's just like Rhonda came in her space.

1570
01:38:56,010 --> 01:39:00,030
Holly just like stepped back, like
kept proper distance, you know,

1571
01:39:00,031 --> 01:39:03,240
like defensive distance.
I'm super,

1572
01:39:03,241 --> 01:39:05,550
super low key watch her reaction.

1573
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:14,000
Yeah. She stayed calm for sure. Yeah.
That's, that's skinny Rhonda too.

1574
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:18,530
That's way in Rhonda, which is like, she's
been depleted. Yeah. Yeah. She was Kinda,

1575
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:21,860
she was to look how much
difference which is weighing in

1576
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:29,040
yeah. Tied up and how he didn't give
any ground either and she's just like,

1577
01:39:29,041 --> 01:39:31,470
she stayed calm. She, she backed up,

1578
01:39:31,471 --> 01:39:34,470
but like she backed up like I'm
ready to hit you. Backed up.

1579
01:39:34,471 --> 01:39:35,750
She didn't back up like,
ah,

1580
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:40,890
and then so Rhonda was a
super like emotional too.
She was funny. She was like,

1581
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:45,840
all this is just trying to get a drink.
Yeah. I just thought I was having a drink.

1582
01:39:45,841 --> 01:39:49,930
I Dunno. Yeah. Yeah. It was
great. And then Ron was like us,

1583
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:55,830
she was super right. And you never
saw her like that. You're like,

1584
01:39:55,831 --> 01:40:00,330
what the fuck? Yeah. Yeah. I
think you nailed it. As far
as the breaking point. Yeah.

1585
01:40:00,510 --> 01:40:03,120
She got sucked into all
the Hollywood bullshit.

1586
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:07,230
They were putting her in movies and TV
shows and choose on different talk shows

1587
01:40:07,231 --> 01:40:11,280
as the type to like someone. Could she
beat Cain Velasquez? Could she, you know,

1588
01:40:11,281 --> 01:40:15,240
and it's like, oh my God, look
what she's doing to these women.

1589
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:19,720
Could she remember that? Right?
There's like, wow. It was the creative,

1590
01:40:19,870 --> 01:40:24,150
she was a superstar. You know, I'm, look,
I was a part of this. I mean she has now,

1591
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:27,870
she's still a superstar now.
She's a WWE superstar.

1592
01:40:27,871 --> 01:40:31,530
It's just a different kind of superstar.
Do you think she should? Yeah.

1593
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:32,833
Well makes you say that.

1594
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:35,183
Okay.

1595
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:40,160
Like, don't go out like that.
This is Miriam target now.
It's a different person.

1596
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:43,460
Oh,
she just,

1597
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:50,720
she deserves better than to go out
the way you know her last fight. Well,

1598
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:54,400
she deserves, she's exactly
what she got. She's,

1599
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:57,990
no, no, this is what I think she's better
than that. That's think you're writing.

1600
01:40:58,090 --> 01:40:59,530
I think you're right.
That she's better than that.

1601
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:04,330
It's bad that she got punched
like that. No, no, no, no,
no. I'm saying she, she just,

1602
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:09,360
she deserves better than that to like
represent herself better than yeah,

1603
01:41:09,650 --> 01:41:11,340
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1604
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:14,890
I don't think that matters to her as
much as it matters for other folks.

1605
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:18,850
I think she really cemented her legacy
is one of the greatest women's MMA

1606
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:20,560
champions ever in a pioneer.

1607
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:26,070
But I also think that women's MMA has
evolved so fast that within the brief time

1608
01:41:27,191 --> 01:41:31,090
that she was running shit, the sport
passed her by. And when you see,

1609
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:34,990
the one that I was always worried about
with her was Amanda. Cause I was like,

1610
01:41:34,991 --> 01:41:39,910
Amanda Nunez has a black belt in Brazilian
Jujitsu and nasty hands like to me.

1611
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:44,830
Um, I think she has some judo. I Dunno
what her, her ranking isn't judo.

1612
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:46,270
I don't know.
She could be,

1613
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:50,950
but I know she's a black belt in
Jujitsu and I know she had heavy hands.

1614
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:55,870
And my thought was at Rhonda, although
she was developing good striking skills.

1615
01:41:55,871 --> 01:41:58,210
She's known for a judo in her arm bars.
That's her big thing.

1616
01:41:58,450 --> 01:42:02,260
And the striking skills were sort of like
something that was happening along the

1617
01:42:02,261 --> 01:42:04,090
way and she was starting to catch girls,

1618
01:42:04,091 --> 01:42:08,320
but she was catching girls like batch
go, hey. Uh, and you know, and yeah,

1619
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:11,320
and, and beating them down
when she gets them down,

1620
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:15,380
they're not nearly on the
level of an Amanda Nunez.

1621
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:18,910
Like you're not going to catch her
like that. And if she, right, exactly.

1622
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:21,970
And my thought was that if,
if it was going to go down,

1623
01:42:21,971 --> 01:42:25,810
it was going to be Amanda because Amanda
just hit so fucking hard. And then,

1624
01:42:25,811 --> 01:42:30,811
so when she came back and immediately
fought for the world title against Amanda,

1625
01:42:31,090 --> 01:42:34,840
she needed a gimme fuck. Yeah, she
needed, she needed a different camp.

1626
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,680
I think that's fair. She needed a lot.
She needed a revamping of her approach.

1627
01:42:38,681 --> 01:42:42,550
She needed a lot of things. She had
a lot of things because people knew,

1628
01:42:42,551 --> 01:42:44,440
first of all,
she never shoots for doubles.

1629
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:46,780
She's not taking you down
with the lower body attack.

1630
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:48,700
It's always upper body
and it's always a clinch.

1631
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:52,630
And she clinches with her left arm. I
mean Greg Jackson, Jackson Winkeljohn,

1632
01:42:52,631 --> 01:42:55,240
they all figured that out. And Holly
had the solution for that. Yeah.

1633
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:57,080
You know it also does.

1634
01:42:57,081 --> 01:43:00,100
Another thing is when you can't fucking
head kicked into oblivion that way.

1635
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:04,960
Like you need a lot of time off.
A lot of time with the no sparring,

1636
01:43:04,961 --> 01:43:07,240
no nothing.
Especially as being so high.

1637
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:12,070
I think so untouchable and high and then
getting coming crashing down to earth

1638
01:43:12,071 --> 01:43:16,750
like that. So it's rough.
That's a definitely like a big,

1639
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:20,890
who am I moment? I think
I'm sure. Yeah. Well look,

1640
01:43:20,891 --> 01:43:22,740
can we talk right?

1641
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:26,800
But you were talking about you trying
to figure out who you are when you

1642
01:43:26,801 --> 01:43:28,000
couldn't train anymore.

1643
01:43:28,130 --> 01:43:32,130
He and I had that on such
a s like small scale,

1644
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:37,110
a pride compares private skill
and hurts personally but private.

1645
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:42,560
And heres this the world.
Yes. In the whole world. Uh,

1646
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:47,450
mine was like more tragic and hers
was more humiliating, humiliating. Mm.

1647
01:43:47,710 --> 01:43:52,010
You know, how was yours more tragic?
Um, it happened in third round

1648
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:56,300
of a fight, a world title fight, MMA. Um,

1649
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,060
it wasn't a clear like it
happened on a takedown.

1650
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:02,780
It wasn't a takedown that Tor
twerked or tweaked my knee,

1651
01:44:02,781 --> 01:44:05,270
you're grabbed on my knee or it was,
um,

1652
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:10,210
I pushed against them while
my body was like this, um, uh,

1653
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:15,270
parallel to the ground and
uh, I tore my own ACL. Yeah.

1654
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:20,650
So it was like, why is that more tragic?
Um, because it was more like, no, no,

1655
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:23,300
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Um,

1656
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:28,280
I think it's more humiliating to
get knocked out, in my opinion,

1657
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:33,490
to get knocked out sure. Than it
is to get like, injured out, like,

1658
01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:38,090
like tear, tear out, like still fighting.
And then you'd step back and you,

1659
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:42,440
everything slips and you fall. Right.
Because your knee can't, it's gone. Yeah.

1660
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:47,330
You know, that's what I mean when I say
tragic or if you're like winning the,

1661
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:52,160
winning the for the fight. And
then unfortunate. Yeah, yeah,

1662
01:44:52,190 --> 01:44:53,180
yeah.
So it's more

1663
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:58,010
fortunate and then your identity stripped
away. But again, yours is private.

1664
01:44:58,011 --> 01:44:58,701
Hers is public,

1665
01:44:58,701 --> 01:45:03,701
but at least you understand what it's
like to not be that person who you di you

1666
01:45:03,921 --> 01:45:04,581
counted on,

1667
01:45:04,581 --> 01:45:08,030
you being that person as part of your
shield that you put on to go through the

1668
01:45:08,031 --> 01:45:08,620
day.
Yeah,

1669
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:12,520
for sure. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1670
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:16,870
So her persona, um, she's
damn good at it too.

1671
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:19,210
And then it's like stripped away.

1672
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:22,910
Well, she was the first, well,
Gina Carano was the first, right.

1673
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:25,430
The people sort of identified with like,
wow,

1674
01:45:25,431 --> 01:45:28,400
here's this pretty girl who
kicks ass and this is crazy.

1675
01:45:28,401 --> 01:45:32,480
We never seen this before, but it was
at a smaller scale. People just didn't,

1676
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:36,830
they didn't kind of understand who she
was or what she was [inaudible] it wasn't

1677
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:39,900
as big. Yeah. It wasn't nearly as
big as tiny in comparison. Yeah.

1678
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:42,410
But then when Ron came along,
it was like this perfect storm.

1679
01:45:42,411 --> 01:45:46,670
It's like the UFC was huge. Everything
was taking off and then here's his girl,

1680
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:48,110
just fucking everybody up

1681
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:52,170
hers. Hers was much
more, uh, violence to me.

1682
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:57,180
Then Gina's like, she'd like, you're
getting slammed, right. And just like,

1683
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,320
you know what I mean? And
when your arm broke. Yeah,

1684
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:03,450
basically like recruit some super group
when she fought Misha and cranked her on

1685
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:08,870
the show is amazing. 21 tab man. I
snapped her arm and half. God Damn. Yeah.

1686
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:12,830
And she's still not tapping. It's like
a tearing the chicken and the, exactly.

1687
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:14,400
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1688
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:18,030
I mean she has a bad ass for that
one now during all this time.

1689
01:46:18,090 --> 01:46:20,580
I mean this is when

1690
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:25,700
Rhonda is taking off and when Holly's
taking off and Amanda Nunez is taking off

1691
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:29,510
all this time is when you're at your peak,

1692
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:33,200
you're at your peak as a fighter and then
you're dealing with all these fucking

1693
01:46:33,201 --> 01:46:37,850
injuries and you're working your
way to get into this circus.

1694
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:41,330
I mean, you're, you're working in way to
step into this arena. I mean, this is,

1695
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:44,330
this is like ultimately
this was your goal. Yeah.

1696
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:46,700
What the fuck is that like to
be just sitting there on their,

1697
01:46:46,701 --> 01:46:50,340
dealing with all this bullshit
watching else do it. Yeah.

1698
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:51,810
Oh,
it was maddening.

1699
01:46:52,830 --> 01:46:55,650
Well I think about the time that I was
sitting next to you watching those fights.

1700
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:56,560
Yeah.

1701
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:01,140
Do you want fucking smash him
making me fucking nervous.

1702
01:47:02,230 --> 01:47:05,850
It was worse actually.
So that time I only blew up to one 65.

1703
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:11,430
Um, this time I blew up to one 86. Yeah,

1704
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:16,050
it was big. Well, you use, that's
almost, that's almost one nine. Yeah,

1705
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:20,550
it was 200. Yeah, exactly.
Exactly. And uh, I was um,

1706
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:25,300
I'm drinking and it was an eating ride
and I was, yeah, it a bunch of stuff.

1707
01:47:25,450 --> 01:47:28,080
So how'd you turn around?
Um,

1708
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:34,230
ultimately I think,
so I taught rock steady boxing.

1709
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:39,920
It's a Roxy to boxing is a program for
people with Parkinson's disease and it

1710
01:47:40,561 --> 01:47:43,480
teaches them how to box
and that helps them, uh,

1711
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:45,270
with their symptoms and their quality.

1712
01:47:45,271 --> 01:47:48,210
It improves their quality of life and
gives them a sense that it gives them a

1713
01:47:48,211 --> 01:47:52,980
community to, to be in. And the
interesting about rock city boxing was,

1714
01:47:52,981 --> 01:47:54,690
I thought I was going to be,

1715
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:59,130
it was a terrible fit and I was terrified
that I was gonna hurt them and it

1716
01:47:59,131 --> 01:48:00,330
actually was the best fit.

1717
01:48:00,990 --> 01:48:05,990
And they loved being in my classes and
I love teaching them and like honestly,

1718
01:48:06,541 --> 01:48:09,180
they healed my heart.
Like they healed that.

1719
01:48:09,181 --> 01:48:13,980
Not good enough that I felt wow.
Yeah.

1720
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:18,740
It was pretty crazy. So teaching
and helping people. Yeah.

1721
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,800
We're brought it around for you and
like seeing understanding that I can

1722
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:26,160
definitely understand like,

1723
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:29,650
my body is doing this and I
want to do that and there's,

1724
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:32,130
I can't do anything about it,
you know,

1725
01:48:32,131 --> 01:48:36,360
and that frustration and it's infuriating
and I'm like watching them go through

1726
01:48:36,361 --> 01:48:39,570
what they, they go through
and it was just incredible.

1727
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,610
And they just show up and they,
they,

1728
01:48:41,690 --> 01:48:43,980
they just work so hard
and they're just fighting,

1729
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:48,540
scrape a little grandmas
and grandpas. Wow. Yeah.

1730
01:48:48,630 --> 01:48:52,890
Did you see the rock city
video? No. Uber. Uber.

1731
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:57,090
Uber did a mini documentary on me.
Yeah. I've never seen it. Yeah.

1732
01:48:57,210 --> 01:49:00,180
How long has it made any documentary?
Can we watch two minutes now.

1733
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:03,420
We'll get kicked off the internet if
we pull it off and put it on Youtube.

1734
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:08,880
People always claim it or we got our
videos taken down unfortunately. Oh,

1735
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:11,970
watch it afterwards and I'll tweet
it. Yeah, yeah, I'll put it up.

1736
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:14,640
That's fucking awesome.
And I'll make you,

1737
01:49:15,230 --> 01:49:19,530
it might make you tear up a little
bit or to Europe. Easy. Let me too,

1738
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:24,600
I'm a crier. Like, it's not just
like sad or like I'm happy I'll cry.

1739
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:29,310
I'll actually, after you asked me to be
on this podcast, I was having moments,

1740
01:49:29,311 --> 01:49:34,110
there's like kind of crying all
ever since because it was just like,

1741
01:49:34,111 --> 01:49:38,430
yeah, I was just like, Holy Shit.
So for me, coming back to fighting,

1742
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:41,340
I,
it's Curian was like,

1743
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:44,160
we were talking about a game plan about
coming back and um, he's like, okay,

1744
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:47,620
so this is what I think. I think,
you know, getting the right fight,

1745
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:50,400
like getting a moist, high
fight, maybe WBC diamond belt.

1746
01:49:50,401 --> 01:49:53,980
And that is like all I wanted when
I was active fighting five years,

1747
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:56,690
that's all I fucking wanted.
Like it broke my heart,

1748
01:49:56,691 --> 01:49:59,200
hurt my heart that they wouldn't
sanction that for women.

1749
01:49:59,750 --> 01:50:03,010
It was so frustrating to me. And he's
talking about that and he's like, yeah,

1750
01:50:03,011 --> 01:50:05,890
we'll get this fight and then that'll
be your way to come back. And I'm like,

1751
01:50:05,891 --> 01:50:09,490
I don't give a fuck. I don't want
another world title. I have enough.

1752
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:12,700
Like how much fucking good
enough do I need to be? I'm done.

1753
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:17,740
Like I just want to be paid. Like just
fuck you pay me. I saw all I want.

1754
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:22,540
They go. And so when I you say that,
but once you start preparing, no,

1755
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:24,520
I'm still going to do,
it was fucking best of my ability.

1756
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:29,940
But I'm not like I would take a fight
that's $1,500 $3,000 for a world title

1757
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,140
fight to get a chance to fight for that
world title. Like now I'm like, hell no,

1758
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:39,730
no. I will take a non world title
fight that pays more over a world title

1759
01:50:39,731 --> 01:50:44,080
opportunity.
Or are you looking to compete now in MMA?

1760
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:46,840
Are you looking to compete and Moy
Tai or are you looking to compete in

1761
01:50:46,841 --> 01:50:51,740
kickboxing? I'm looking to compete in
whatever pays me touching. Yeah, yeah,

1762
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:56,710
yeah. So dollar mode. When you asked me
to be on this podcast and I was like,

1763
01:50:56,740 --> 01:51:01,030
Holy Shit.
So this in turn would get my followers up,

1764
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:03,940
which in turn would make it so I could
get paid more the next time I fight.

1765
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:08,380
Do you see that? Yeah. And
I was just like, oh my God,

1766
01:51:08,381 --> 01:51:12,970
this is so like thank you so much.
And it was just like, you know,

1767
01:51:12,971 --> 01:51:16,180
I was just feeling like my eyes welling
up with tears and I felt hella nervous.

1768
01:51:16,181 --> 01:51:18,940
I was like, oh my God. There's like how
many subscribers on this shit? Oh Geez.

1769
01:51:18,941 --> 01:51:21,980
Can I say attention to what I was like,
she might be doing a good job. Not

1770
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:29,290
microdosing today. No. But,
um, what I said to myself,

1771
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:32,890
cause I do, I did feel very nervous and
I do still, but when I said to myself,

1772
01:51:32,891 --> 01:51:34,750
I was like, well, it wouldn't be
happening if he weren't ready.

1773
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:38,220
So this didn't happen before
when you were active fighting,

1774
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:40,810
you're winning all these world titles.
Like you weren't ready.

1775
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:44,800
So you're ready now. That's
a good attitude. Yeah.

1776
01:51:45,070 --> 01:51:50,010
But I would have had John back
then too. I wasn't ready. You,

1777
01:51:50,270 --> 01:51:54,370
I'm sure you would have been fine. No,
no, I wasn't ready. Really. Yeah. Yeah,

1778
01:51:54,371 --> 01:51:58,300
for sure. Cause I think I didn't know
myself the way I know myself now.

1779
01:51:58,690 --> 01:52:02,500
I didn't trust myself.
I didn't have everything taken.

1780
01:52:02,501 --> 01:52:07,501
All my strength taken away from me
and then I'll come out of it by my,

1781
01:52:07,601 --> 01:52:12,290
yeah, I mean like one of the things that
the rock steady boxing got me back in,

1782
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:14,560
like help heal my heart.
But also the other thing was like,

1783
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:18,070
I kept trying to train, I kept trying to
get better. I kept trying to, you know,

1784
01:52:18,071 --> 01:52:18,904
and lose weight,

1785
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:21,700
but my knee was still fucking with me and
I'd get inflammation and this and that.

1786
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:24,880
And so finally I just said, you know
what? I think Dominick Cruz did this too,

1787
01:52:24,881 --> 01:52:29,080
where he's just like, maybe I don't
get to fight again. Like maybe that,

1788
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:31,060
that's just what it is and

1789
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:38,210
I'm not crying. You're
crying. It's okay. I just,

1790
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:41,950
okay,
I've cried on this project.

1791
01:52:43,210 --> 01:52:47,750
I made peace with that and then
things started getting better.

1792
01:52:48,910 --> 01:52:52,550
I don't know.
I don't know why or how,

1793
01:52:52,551 --> 01:52:54,740
but like somehow like fixating,

1794
01:52:54,741 --> 01:52:58,340
it wouldn't let me move forward.

1795
01:52:58,950 --> 01:53:03,950
Like it just kept holding onto it like
wasn't when it wasn't working or I'm

1796
01:53:04,071 --> 01:53:08,510
going to said, okay, then I don't
get to fight again. All right,

1797
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:13,700
let it go. And that's when
it came back to me. I Dunno.

1798
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:16,450
Do you think that,
I think will,

1799
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:21,470
I think that for the average person that's
watching this and doesn't understand

1800
01:53:21,781 --> 01:53:23,160
this fixation on fighting,

1801
01:53:23,161 --> 01:53:27,480
I think it comes back to what were talking
about before that it's so difficult

1802
01:53:27,570 --> 01:53:32,020
and so rewarding and so
impossible and you're,

1803
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:34,920
you're finding out about
yourself during the struggle.

1804
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:38,740
And then it is my therapy.
Yeah. It doesn't like,

1805
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:41,050
so I used to do a lot of drugs.

1806
01:53:41,051 --> 01:53:45,850
Like I used to do math where I
weighed 126 pounds. I'm five,

1807
01:53:45,851 --> 01:53:50,440
nine, that's not normal for
me. And I did so much partying,

1808
01:53:50,441 --> 01:53:52,660
so much drugs,
so much like self abuse.

1809
01:53:52,661 --> 01:53:56,560
And then I started training and I used
to smoke a pack of Marlboro reds a day.

1810
01:53:56,740 --> 01:54:00,250
You know, I would go on benders and
stab like four or five days in a row,

1811
01:54:00,730 --> 01:54:05,420
you know? And, uh, I started training Moy,

1812
01:54:05,421 --> 01:54:09,460
Tai, and that's when I stopped.
Like, it wasn't immediate,

1813
01:54:09,461 --> 01:54:12,070
it wasn't like quit cold Turkey,
you know,

1814
01:54:12,190 --> 01:54:16,930
I just like over time as I moved towards
the goal of fighting and it took me I

1815
01:54:16,931 --> 01:54:19,730
think five years before I fought.
So I started training [inaudible].

1816
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:23,080
It took me five fucking years. And, um,

1817
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:28,600
I stopped doing drugs, I stopped
partying, I stopped smoking, I stopped,

1818
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:32,110
you know, I started having a
more disciplined and disciplined,

1819
01:54:32,111 --> 01:54:35,710
regimented lifestyle and it was just
refining some people get sober through

1820
01:54:35,711 --> 01:54:39,010
working the steps.
Training was my steps.

1821
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:41,860
Training was my way of

1822
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:48,450
getting to know myself and getting to
sift through what wasn't me and what was

1823
01:54:49,091 --> 01:54:49,301
me.

1824
01:54:49,301 --> 01:54:54,301
I was told a lot of things that I was
when I was a kid and I come to find out I

1825
01:54:54,731 --> 01:54:58,570
wasn't those things. I'm hardworking, I'm
disciplined, I'm intelligent, and I'm a,

1826
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:02,860
you know, I'm all these other things
that I was never told I was, you know,

1827
01:55:02,861 --> 01:55:07,670
and it was all through fighting.
So yeah. Well, fighting

1828
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:11,270
gave you a venue that gave you

1829
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:16,410
then training. Yes, but
I think fighting made me,

1830
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:18,810
I know because if only I'd trained,

1831
01:55:20,610 --> 01:55:22,080
I wouldn't have

1832
01:55:23,790 --> 01:55:28,090
gone as deep as I needed to
go to get to the shit. Right.

1833
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:29,790
That fucking like,
you know,

1834
01:55:29,791 --> 01:55:34,791
the cart crust layer that
you got to fucking dig under
and like get in there and

1835
01:55:36,751 --> 01:55:38,790
sort of go through that stuff.
Yeah.

1836
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:41,480
You would have polished yourself up
a little bit. Yeah. But it wasn't,

1837
01:55:41,490 --> 01:55:42,780
it wouldn't have,

1838
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:48,320
he'll do changed my makeup or
even allowed me to be who I am,

1839
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:51,383
you know?

1840
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:53,533
Yeah.

1841
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:55,170
Like right now it's kind of a trip.

1842
01:55:55,171 --> 01:55:59,810
Like I feel like I'm in bloom or just
learning faster than I ever have.

1843
01:56:00,650 --> 01:56:04,610
It's easy. And uh, like Dave,

1844
01:56:05,050 --> 01:56:08,510
it was tripping out on me because he was
watching me train or watching stuff I

1845
01:56:08,511 --> 01:56:08,971
was doing.

1846
01:56:08,971 --> 01:56:13,971
And it's so much easier to do the
things without bullshit in the way.

1847
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:20,240
Bullshit and your brain. Yeah. Yeah.
Bullshit in my brain and my emotions,

1848
01:56:20,241 --> 01:56:24,650
my like these limiting beliefs
about myself, it's so much easier.

1849
01:56:26,090 --> 01:56:30,920
Or, or to finally be able to
be in a space where I'm like,

1850
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:33,860
okay, you're doing this.
What am I doing? Okay.

1851
01:56:34,730 --> 01:56:37,550
I'm not matching what you're
doing or what are you feeling?

1852
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:42,260
What am I feeling where I think a lot
of people, when they first start out,

1853
01:56:42,261 --> 01:56:46,640
they just do what they're told
instead of questioning the concept,

1854
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:50,870
questioning the, you
know, so it's, it's just,

1855
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:55,820
I think the more mature I get, the
easier, the more I know myself.

1856
01:56:55,821 --> 01:57:00,620
So the easier it is to get the information
that I need to master the thing.

1857
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:03,760
Well, this is always
the, the, the big race.

1858
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:08,860
They're big races to achieve
maturity before your body does. Yeah.

1859
01:57:09,070 --> 01:57:12,110
Before your body wear and tear
on the spotty, on average,

1860
01:57:12,730 --> 01:57:16,180
especially anybody in combat
sports and sports at 42 yeah.

1861
01:57:16,330 --> 01:57:17,770
And to be able to achieve

1862
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:24,290
enough mental maturity while
your body is still pliable and,

1863
01:57:25,130 --> 01:57:29,550
and, and viable, it still works
and you can still execute.

1864
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:34,440
You still a vitality isn't Demetrius
Johnson? Amazing. Fucking amazing.

1865
01:57:34,530 --> 01:57:36,150
So amazing.
Yeah.

1866
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:40,130
I'm not even thinking about all the
incredible things he does without a fight.

1867
01:57:40,550 --> 01:57:42,140
I'm thinking about his
post fight interview.

1868
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:46,260
Oh, he's fantastic. He's amazing.
Yeah. No, he's just an awesome dude.

1869
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:50,250
He's so just like right there,
isn't he? Yeah. He's like, no,

1870
01:57:50,251 --> 01:57:52,980
this is what I do and this is what it's
going to happen and we planned for this

1871
01:57:52,981 --> 01:57:55,890
and no, no, no, no, no, no. And
that's it. Super. Matter of fact,

1872
01:57:56,310 --> 01:57:59,190
well his coach Matt Hume is
one of the grades. Absolutely.

1873
01:57:59,210 --> 01:58:04,010
I want to meet that guy. I just love to
watch that training happen. She's like,

1874
01:58:04,050 --> 01:58:07,990
get to get to be able to pick up on the
energy and the magic in the room. Well,

1875
01:58:07,991 --> 01:58:12,360
I'd like the fact that he's now going to
one FC and one FC is going to pay him a

1876
01:58:12,361 --> 01:58:16,650
fuck load of money in the US on your
season is weird state where the reality

1877
01:58:16,651 --> 01:58:21,600
financially about the flyweight division
is, it's just not a big, big cell.

1878
01:58:21,630 --> 01:58:25,890
It's not like people are dying
to watch 125 pound dudes fight.

1879
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:27,540
People don't like tiny men.
I mean,

1880
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:30,900
it's weird because it's the first
one is going to take that as a quote.

1881
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:36,570
Take 10 of the context. Probably going
to be a picture of you standing there.

1882
01:58:36,770 --> 01:58:40,760
Jack, the six pack with
belts on. Pete talked about

1883
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:45,520
tiny men like they're out there other
man bits or something fucking weird.

1884
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:49,120
That's also a thing that people don't
like. But the thing is like, see,

1885
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:51,630
I'd like I said it, I don't like
watching heavyweights fight. Right.

1886
01:58:52,130 --> 01:58:55,210
I like watching the smaller weights fight
cause usually they're more technical.

1887
01:58:55,570 --> 01:59:00,370
Well he's just technicals there's,
and he's, he moves seamlessly.

1888
01:59:00,371 --> 01:59:03,570
If this would is talking about being
about being able to be authentic,

1889
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:05,920
express yourself from moment to moment,
you know,

1890
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:10,030
and not have to like play it safe and
stay back and stay outside in a way.

1891
01:59:10,031 --> 01:59:12,730
And yeah,
he's just in there and he flows.

1892
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:16,630
He also does what we talked about earlier
where I said that I don't think you

1893
01:59:16,631 --> 01:59:18,160
should ever fight stupid.

1894
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:23,480
That you should fight within the best
so you could express your abilities and

1895
01:59:24,071 --> 01:59:26,680
your techniques the best.
And that's what he does.

1896
01:59:26,690 --> 01:59:30,450
Situational condom on every,
you know what I mean?

1897
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:34,300
Even though he's being offensive, he
still has protection. Right. Listen,

1898
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:38,980
situational condoms, condom. It's a funny
way of putting it. Yeah, that is true.

1899
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:43,660
Yeah. Is, um, what are you
leaning towards you? I mean,

1900
01:59:43,661 --> 01:59:46,300
I know you're saying like,
what if you get an equal offer,

1901
01:59:46,570 --> 01:59:49,290
an equal offer and Muay Thai
and equal offer an MMA would,

1902
01:59:49,291 --> 01:59:52,390
what would you lean towards?
I would want to do MMA,

1903
01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:56,890
but tie it would be, yeah man. Wait
has never fucking loved me back.

1904
01:59:57,430 --> 02:00:02,410
Whoa. Serious Shit right
there. I said, man, I'm still,
I was never loved you back.

1905
02:00:03,020 --> 02:00:07,530
No. So that's some deep
childhood shit right there, Mary.

1906
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:11,560
Yeah,
Mary world or world champion childhood.

1907
02:00:12,410 --> 02:00:16,960
Like I had my baby beginnings
as a champion. So do you also,

1908
02:00:17,230 --> 02:00:17,950
first of all,

1909
02:00:17,950 --> 02:00:22,780
you have a massive advantage and
stand up over most girls in MMA.

1910
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:26,350
That's also been a deal. It doesn't
matter if I don't make the adjustment.

1911
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:30,850
Of course, of course. So
I can't think that like,

1912
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:36,280
oh, I'm better because like
oftentimes with a lot of MMA,

1913
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:40,960
MMA fighters and Cesar Gracie
said this to me, he's like in MMA,

1914
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:44,620
the girls, they're like pit bulls.
Like they don't have the technique,

1915
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:48,250
but they have, they have the,
they get by on the toughness.

1916
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:53,110
So like with a pit bull you like you'd
have to kill it, right? Yeah, yeah,

1917
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:57,290
yeah. There's a lot of that
for sure. We'll definitely, um,

1918
02:00:57,370 --> 02:01:00,010
fluster the fuck out of
a high level striker.

1919
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:04,690
I mean look at the Petrosian and rusty.
Yeah.

1920
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:09,580
Yeah. But in diversity is pretty high
level too though. But I've never seen,

1921
02:01:10,250 --> 02:01:11,920
not that I've watched all
the puck Trojans fights,

1922
02:01:11,921 --> 02:01:15,760
but I have never seen him get entangled
like that, that often. True. That is not,

1923
02:01:15,761 --> 02:01:19,940
and risky. Just made it ugly. He
made it a brawl. And that's why you,

1924
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:25,180
it's an interesting fight. But who knows?
Like I said, who knows where he was at?

1925
02:01:25,181 --> 02:01:28,720
What was going on in his head? Injuries,
sickness. Who knows what happened?

1926
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:31,930
That beard. The beard. Yeah. I Dunno.

1927
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:34,850
Cowboy Cerrone looks as good as it's
ever looked his last fight. Yeah,

1928
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:38,170
but that's phony. That's not
petroleum for traditions like sexy.

1929
02:01:38,171 --> 02:01:42,260
He's got the sexist, the Toronto, me,
Donald, Donald Cerrone's not sexy.

1930
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:44,390
Not like the way Petrossian
is like everything.

1931
02:01:44,391 --> 02:01:48,200
Petrossian is like pretty the things he
does, the way he fights. It's pretty, oh,

1932
02:01:48,201 --> 02:01:49,820
I see what you're saying. It's
like part what? He's sexy.

1933
02:01:49,821 --> 02:01:54,580
He's like patrol and he's Italian.
Okay. Yeah. Yo come on Georgia. Yeah,

1934
02:01:54,581 --> 02:01:57,320
I see what I mean. You shouldn't have
that fucking beard. Plucked them up.

1935
02:01:57,890 --> 02:02:00,910
Made them less aerodynamic.
Okay.

1936
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:04,520
I'm a big believer in beer power.

1937
02:02:05,810 --> 02:02:09,680
So my dad had a beard growing up and
now I see all these 30 year olds,

1938
02:02:09,681 --> 02:02:12,620
20 year olds hipsters with like their
beard oil and their periods and I'm just

1939
02:02:12,621 --> 02:02:15,140
like gross.

1940
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:20,260
I have a real problem with beards with
men that looked like they would break

1941
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:21,793
real easy.

1942
02:02:22,850 --> 02:02:27,430
You know I can't stand man with
skinny necks. Yeah, that's a,

1943
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:30,530
that's an uncomfortable buff
dudes with skinny necks.

1944
02:02:30,830 --> 02:02:32,930
That means they're not doing
anything because I'm just like,

1945
02:02:32,931 --> 02:02:37,400
that's shit's not real. Right. You'll
get, you'll get fucked up. Yeah.

1946
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:40,830
That's just not real. You can't fight.
Your head's barely hanging on there

1947
02:02:43,570 --> 02:02:48,080
like a chicken and the third world country
where they just like that and rip the

1948
02:02:48,081 --> 02:02:48,914
head off the chicken.

1949
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:53,270
Well it shows a severe lack of core
strength cause like if you're doing like

1950
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:56,030
dead lifts and if you're doing
anything with your traps,

1951
02:02:56,031 --> 02:02:59,340
you're going to develop a thick neck.
If you're doing anything where you got up,

1952
02:02:59,341 --> 02:03:01,190
hoist things up off the ground,

1953
02:03:01,340 --> 02:03:04,040
you have a look at those mother fuckers
in the Olympics at do dead lifts.

1954
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:08,770
They have giant ass net. Then I gradually
anybody they have huge next. Yeah,

1955
02:03:08,780 --> 02:03:10,100
because they're doing this whole time

1956
02:03:11,910 --> 02:03:16,820
that's all fucking neck and back and the
whole spinal column has to be strong.

1957
02:03:16,910 --> 02:03:21,700
He looks scary, man. It's guys who are
doing this shit and then they're posing.

1958
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:26,820
They pose it
guys with Nintex has the modern,

1959
02:03:27,750 --> 02:03:31,680
yeah, he's got no neck. He
taps quick. That postures.

1960
02:03:32,010 --> 02:03:36,410
That is a preposterous snack.
I feel like if you had kicked him,

1961
02:03:36,411 --> 02:03:39,080
he might die. Right. It's not, his
head's not going to be attached.

1962
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:42,130
He snap that shit down.
Look at that.

1963
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,390
Yeah.
Jesus crazy.

1964
02:03:45,770 --> 02:03:49,640
He's like a pit bull in that was the dark
days right before that was the court.

1965
02:03:49,700 --> 02:03:53,300
But when they were putting them
in jail for rape, did he do it?

1966
02:03:54,050 --> 02:03:57,140
What does that article say? If you have
a no, I don't, I don't believe he did.

1967
02:03:57,141 --> 02:04:01,790
I might be wrong, but that girl, um, she
falsely accused someone of rape earlier.

1968
02:04:02,860 --> 02:04:06,650
Oh yeah. If you have a thin neck,
you're my most likely a Beta male.

1969
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:10,400
How about takeout? Most
likely. How about just you are,

1970
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:15,350
you are a Beta male. Who's, who's out
there running shit with a thin neck.

1971
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:19,480
You can't be running.
Shit been there.

1972
02:04:20,270 --> 02:04:23,630
How could you be running shit with
your mom's house? Got this guy.

1973
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:26,150
You probably hold that net guy.
Damn long neck.

1974
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:30,950
What do you mean it's got the
longest? Who's this guy? Oh,

1975
02:04:31,060 --> 02:04:33,530
I thought I have seen that guy.
Yeah,

1976
02:04:33,650 --> 02:04:36,590
I thought you going to bring up that
guy who's been in the Internet. Memes.

1977
02:04:36,710 --> 02:04:38,280
The dude who's now fighting MMA.

1978
02:04:38,281 --> 02:04:42,150
Black Guy who's neck starts at the top
of his head and goes straight down here.

1979
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:46,890
He's got the craziest neck
Evers. You said a weird neck. Oh,

1980
02:04:46,891 --> 02:04:50,130
I thought it was just like distorted.
Oh No.

1981
02:04:50,131 --> 02:04:54,030
There's a bunch of pictures of this cat
and was like, oh, they just did the thing.

1982
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:57,210
They didn't do.
The thing do does a nutty neck.

1983
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:02,020
You know some girls have giant tits.
This guy is just to neck. Yeah.

1984
02:05:02,030 --> 02:05:05,490
I mean some people, huge hands.
He's going to start fighting MMA.

1985
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:10,290
But where's he from? I Dunno. Probably
Florida. I buddies from Florida.

1986
02:05:10,470 --> 02:05:15,050
Look at it. Look at his neck. He got
arrested again. What does it say?

1987
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:19,590
When did he get arrested?
The first one you look at as ne,

1988
02:05:20,330 --> 02:05:23,060
well someone's going to teach them,
but what is going on with that neck?

1989
02:05:24,470 --> 02:05:27,980
That's his real neck. That is fucking
crazy. That's like he's got a double neck.

1990
02:05:28,010 --> 02:05:32,900
Maybe just a small job. Now that is a big
neck. What are his parents look like? Um,

1991
02:05:32,930 --> 02:05:36,710
I bet they have giant next to I
put the chips off. Genetic mom.

1992
02:05:36,711 --> 02:05:40,820
Mom's a thick old dog
looking lady first please.

1993
02:05:40,821 --> 02:05:44,940
Smoke shot showed off his really big neck
this time he's not smiling so it's the

1994
02:05:44,941 --> 02:05:49,310
thing. Same. So he's probably power
lifter or something like that.

1995
02:05:49,820 --> 02:05:51,960
Yeah.
And plus got a fucked up neck.

1996
02:05:54,130 --> 02:05:57,950
No need to blow poor man's spot up.
Just fucked up neck.

1997
02:06:02,330 --> 02:06:05,770
But I take his neck over the
skinny neck. No, you know I,

1998
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:08,240
maybe his neck is like
genetically fucked up like that.

1999
02:06:08,510 --> 02:06:11,150
And maybe the go with a skinny neck just
doesn't work out like the situation.

2000
02:06:12,170 --> 02:06:15,550
It's not, it doesn't bug me when
somebody is just, they have, you know,

2001
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:16,431
slender neck.

2002
02:06:16,431 --> 02:06:20,120
But when they go through so much
trouble to look like an Alpha male,

2003
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:25,130
but they have that little chicken neck,
right. And then they're posing like there,

2004
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:28,880
that's gotta be a big issue with you.
Like as a woman,

2005
02:06:29,110 --> 02:06:32,390
like the way you interact
with men as a world champion,

2006
02:06:32,420 --> 02:06:37,040
Muay Thai woman even figured that out.
You have to have a hard time with the men.

2007
02:06:38,060 --> 02:06:42,170
I bet you do. I do. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you
need to get a real one, like a real, real,

2008
02:06:42,940 --> 02:06:45,130
like that's the only way it's
going to work. That it hasn't.

2009
02:06:45,150 --> 02:06:49,880
Now imagine it's hard out
there for a pimp. It is.

2010
02:06:49,881 --> 02:06:53,000
Right.
So I had is a great boyfriend,

2011
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:57,620
but we went out of country.

2012
02:06:57,650 --> 02:07:00,860
We fought on the same card.
He fought the day before me.

2013
02:07:00,861 --> 02:07:04,970
I thought the next day during the
fight he almost gets knocked out

2014
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:10,070
as this guy is mauling him.
He goes like this.

2015
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:13,410
What do you think?
I was thinking.

2016
02:07:14,530 --> 02:07:15,363
Okay.

2017
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:18,910
Um, not good dogs. The
boyfriend, the boyfriend,

2018
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:22,510
my boyfriend was like this.
Yeah. You didn't like it?

2019
02:07:22,750 --> 02:07:27,670
Fuck now to turn you off. Oh my
God, so much. Whoa. I was like,

2020
02:07:27,671 --> 02:07:30,970
dude, you're getting fucked up and you
drop you as you're falling to the canvas.

2021
02:07:30,971 --> 02:07:32,560
You need, still need to go. Fuck you.

2022
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,240
So the way he was getting
beaten was fucking with you.

2023
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:41,250
It wasn't just that he was getting beaten.

2024
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:48,140
I don't care if he wasn't
like,

2025
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:53,590
take that shit. Yeah. Like you know,
like a champ or like, or like a fighter,

2026
02:07:53,610 --> 02:07:57,730
right? Yeah. You can't be like, wow, whoa.

2027
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:05,970
Yeah. That was great.

2028
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:12,200
Maybe sometimes it's like that's
the problem. It's at the balance.

2029
02:08:12,201 --> 02:08:15,030
The ones who are not great boyfriends
are the one that are going to turn you on

2030
02:08:15,450 --> 02:08:20,000
because they're ruthless.
Yeah. Yeah. It was like, I can,

2031
02:08:20,660 --> 02:08:25,490
I can balance that shit. I got
to be ruthless, gentle. Mm.

2032
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:30,060
I was like, I don't not. Well, I mean,
I'm sure someone can sweet kale chips.

2033
02:08:30,061 --> 02:08:33,720
It's great. Yeah. I get it. I
don't get it. Some people can.

2034
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:38,400
Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, I
think your requirements,

2035
02:08:38,820 --> 02:08:40,350
particularly as a fighter,

2036
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:45,420
but going to be extraordinarily high as a
world champion fighter. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2037
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:50,040
It was was better off dating a guy who's
like a navy seal or something who can't

2038
02:08:50,041 --> 02:08:53,930
fight or maybe and fight, but he's
not a fighter. He doesn't like it.

2039
02:08:53,970 --> 02:08:58,770
Knows how to fight, but he's not,
he's a killer. He's not in there.

2040
02:09:00,210 --> 02:09:05,060
Maybe like you could relate
more. Yeah. I don't know.

2041
02:09:05,250 --> 02:09:10,200
I think your dating has it.
I'll try it out and I'll let
you know. Well I've, I've,

2042
02:09:10,630 --> 02:09:13,680
I've, I've noticed this, I mean
except for the ones that are lesbians,

2043
02:09:14,010 --> 02:09:18,240
I was looking at women who are fighters
and I hope they're limited in their

2044
02:09:18,241 --> 02:09:21,060
dating pool.
Cause girls who are fighters,

2045
02:09:21,061 --> 02:09:23,190
they don't want to date
someone who can't fight.

2046
02:09:23,730 --> 02:09:28,530
The last thing a girl wants who's like a
professional fighter or if somebody was

2047
02:09:28,531 --> 02:09:31,110
really smart,
you know what,

2048
02:09:31,290 --> 02:09:35,280
even if the guy is really smart
because it, because then they like,

2049
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:40,640
as long as they asked me somewhere they
have to really fuck. You're like, no, no.

2050
02:09:40,650 --> 02:09:42,900
You could say that. You're trying
to find a nice man. He was like,

2051
02:09:42,901 --> 02:09:46,030
maybe I can compromise. No,
you need a killer. No, it will.

2052
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:48,270
It would've bothered me about
that was like, you're a fighter,

2053
02:09:48,750 --> 02:09:52,830
but you're not being a fighter.
And I'm just like not savage enough.

2054
02:09:53,730 --> 02:09:56,250
Well,
you worried that if the shit hits the fan,

2055
02:09:56,251 --> 02:09:59,520
that's what every woman is worried.
If the shit hits the fan, what?

2056
02:09:59,730 --> 02:10:03,210
How do you react?
How do you react?

2057
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:07,380
And you don't really know until you see
someone react when the shit hits the fan.

2058
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:11,730
And when you see the shit hitting the fan,
you see them going, yikes. You're like,

2059
02:10:11,810 --> 02:10:14,610
fuck,
I can't count on you to,

2060
02:10:14,611 --> 02:10:18,240
I think he would have been better outside
of the fighting situation outside if

2061
02:10:18,241 --> 02:10:19,710
the shit hit the fan.
Oh.

2062
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:24,540
So it was definitely like
writer's ego, like, Nah,

2063
02:10:24,541 --> 02:10:26,920
dude, you need to have more
bright than that. Well,

2064
02:10:26,921 --> 02:10:31,200
how you do anything is how you
do everything. Okay. All right.

2065
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:33,770
Maybe. Yeah, especially duress.

2066
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:38,060
I mean, people make mistakes. People
panic. People learn from those mistakes.

2067
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:38,391
I mean,

2068
02:10:38,391 --> 02:10:41,930
there are people that fold in fights that
come back way stronger and will never

2069
02:10:41,931 --> 02:10:45,380
fold because they folded before and
they felt it because you made a mistake.

2070
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:46,520
You know, you, you,

2071
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:50,330
you make a split second decision in
the middle of a fight and you know,

2072
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:53,810
and something, something
inside you, you, you, you,

2073
02:10:53,811 --> 02:10:57,620
it exposes weakness that maybe you
weren't prepared for the world to see.

2074
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:59,930
And then when you feel
the pain of that weakness,

2075
02:10:59,931 --> 02:11:02,330
you make a vow that you're never
going to experience that again.

2076
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:06,140
That's entirely possible.
I feel like mental strength is not,

2077
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:09,110
I don't think you either have it or you
don't have it. I don't buy that shit.

2078
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:11,360
I think you can develop it.
I think you can build it.

2079
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:16,600
And I think mental toughness and just the
ability to persevere is something that

2080
02:11:16,671 --> 02:11:19,670
you can cultivate a really believed
that. Absolutely. Absolutely.

2081
02:11:19,671 --> 02:11:24,230
So maybe he needed to caleel shying away
and feel you going, hey motherfucker,

2082
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:27,710
you know, when you get in the head,
don't, don't do any of this shit.

2083
02:11:27,950 --> 02:11:31,490
Maybe someone needs to hear that. So then
when it's happening they go, fuck that.

2084
02:11:31,491 --> 02:11:32,510
I'm not doing this anymore,

2085
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:36,830
and then they dig deep and step to
the side or clench or do something.

2086
02:11:36,860 --> 02:11:40,640
Go out like a warrior. Yeah. You
know, or figure your way a better,

2087
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:44,900
better response to the situation.
Then again,

2088
02:11:44,901 --> 02:11:46,100
sometimes you get clipped in.

2089
02:11:46,101 --> 02:11:50,990
Your neuromuscular system just
goes up and everything's just off.

2090
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:54,680
It's just you're not responding right
because your, your system's getting shot,

2091
02:11:54,710 --> 02:11:58,160
but it was more like, get away from me.
That's not good. Yeah. I didn't like that,

2092
02:12:02,950 --> 02:12:06,770
Miriam.
We said two and a half hours flew by.

2093
02:12:06,771 --> 02:12:11,390
It's four 30 that wasn't scary at all.
It wasn't scary. I told you my friend,

2094
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:16,160
I'm going to take care of you. We're all
good, man. Listen, what have you on again,

2095
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:19,250
when you have a fight scheduled
and we'll pump that shit up. Okay,

2096
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:22,820
let me know when. Let me know
what it is. Bare knuckle boxing,

2097
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:25,520
whatever maybe. Right.
They're doing a lot of that.

2098
02:12:25,670 --> 02:12:28,370
You've got to go to Wyoming and do it on
a ranch or something. Right? Hey, well,

2099
02:12:28,770 --> 02:12:32,090
does it pay well? Yeah,
it does it way more real.

2100
02:12:32,091 --> 02:12:37,091
I know somebody that did four rounds
for 10,004 rounds for 10,000 yes.

2101
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:41,950
You say that like that's not,
that's a lot of money for that. For,

2102
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:44,990
for just boxing. Four rounds
about boxing. Bare knuckle.

2103
02:12:44,991 --> 02:12:48,020
What did he break your hands?
We'll talk.

2104
02:12:50,030 --> 02:12:54,440
Tell people how to find you on Instagram,
on Twitter, all that stuff. Oh, I'm Mary,

2105
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:56,560

Spell it out so people know.

2106
02:12:56,970 --> 02:13:01,490
High R I a M Nakamoto.
Okay.

2107
02:13:01,890 --> 02:13:05,420
Hold on. Nakamoto Nakamoto. It's
on my Instagram. She's linked.

2108
02:13:05,421 --> 02:13:08,420
She'll be linked there. All
right. Thanks man. Appreciate it.

2109
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:10,680
Bye Buddy.
Hi.

2110
02:13:19,350 --> 02:13:19,530
Hmm.
