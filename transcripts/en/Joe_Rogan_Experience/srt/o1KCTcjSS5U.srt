Hello everybody.
What's happening?

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,350
This episode of the podcast is
brought to you by legal zoom.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,160
Legal Zoom is a website that allows you
to do a lot of things that you would

4
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:17,130
normally have to go to a law office to do.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,950
You could do online the comfort
of your home. And this month,

6
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:24,060
legal zoom celebrates innovation
by helping you launch your dream.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,580
You're gonna apply for a patent,
cure your invention,

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,790
register your trademark to protect
your products and services.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,120
Incorporate or form an LLC
to start your business.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,140
All the things you would normally
have to do at a law office,

11
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,640
you'd have to make an appointment.

12
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:41,040
You have to spend a shitload of
money enough to go somewhere,

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,030
do it all from the comfort of
your home quickly and easily.

14
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:48,480
And if you get into a situation where
you're not sure if you're doing everything

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,710
right and you're kind of panicking,

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,450
legal zoom can help you by hooking
you up with a third party independent

17
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:56,790
attorney.
They are not a law firm,

18
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,500
but they can provide you with self help
services and again connect you to a

19
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:05,820
third party attorney. If you're a
scared little bitch and you thank you,

20
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:09,750
done fucked up. They can set up
a lot of things at legal zoom.

21
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:14,700
Like you could form an
LLC, you can, um, you can,

22
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,970
uh, incorporate, you
can set a living, will,

23
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:22,920
you can even get divorced. Believe it
or not, you can get divorced online.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,970
Um, I think you'd have to get, like,
it would have to be really amicable.

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,450
So you know,
couldn't be like arguing custody and shit,

26
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:35,280
but you get a divorce or 299 bucks.
If you and the missus were so inclined,

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,120
you know, like, look enough,
I got 300 bucks, let's fucking
do this. You can do it.

28
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,930
And you going to do it all again
from the comfort of your own home.

system, for health, for mood,
for endurance, shroom Tech Sport,

46
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:55,350
which I took today before I worked
out with Duke motherfucking Rufus.

47
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,230
I take it one hour before every workout.

48
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:02,650
Shroom tech sport is one of my all time
favorite supplements and if if we didn't

49
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:05,890
sell it at on it, I would push a
justice hard. It is fantastic stuff.

50
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:08,710
If you're into anything
that's very difficult to do.

51
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,270
If you're into like some sort of crossfit
star working out or if you wrestle or

52
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:16,180
do martial arts or anything that's very,
very strenuous.

53
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,920
Shroom tech sport is one of the most
amazing supplements that I have ever used

54
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:25,921
as far as giving you a little bit of extra
push and it's based on the courthouse

55
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,960
steps mushroom,
it's all the stuff that we salad on it.

56
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,400
This is one important feature.

57
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,070
If you go to the website and look
at all the different supplements,

58
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,250
there's an overview. There's a bunch
of different tabs you can click on,

59
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:39,250
but one of the most important
ones is the research thing.

60
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,350
All these supplements that are like,

61
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:45,310
whether it's an endurance supplement or
supplements that are designed to raise

62
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:50,020
your testosterone or supplements are
designed to enhance cognitive function.

63
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,270
All that stuff can be very controversial.

64
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:57,271
So we try to show as much research as
possible and provide you with as much

65
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:03,181
information and data as possible
about what has been shown by um,

66
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,320
different double blind placebo studies
like the ones that we perform and the

67
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:12,580
ones that other people are performed. We
performed our own on um, on Alpha brain.

68
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,350
The results are all available online.

69
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:17,110
We're actually in the middle
of a second test right now.

70
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,550
Very happy with the results and very
happy with the results from other tests

71
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:22,384
that we can show you.

72
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,430
A quarter seps increases oxygen
utilization utilization by 50%.

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,290
Pretty fascinating stuff.

74
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,910
Double Blind study published
in the medicine and science
and sports meant sports

75
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:38,530
and exercise. Researchers gave 30 male
athletes either cordyceps or a placebo.

76
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,460
The athletes did not change their exercise
routine during the study and after

77
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:43,990
six weeks as cordyceps group,

78
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,820
their oxygen intake was almost double the
placebo groups. All interesting stuff.

79
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:53,130
All with sources. It shows if
you go to the research, um,

80
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,620

95

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,820
Try it by day.
Joe Rogan podcast all day,

97
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,620
my friend.

98
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,670
Well, martial artists,
former kickboxing champion,

99
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,930
commentator for glory,
more accolades on and on.

100
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:06,440
And I'm trainer of some of the greatest
mixed martial arts artists on the planet

101
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,680
earth. Two goofus ladies and gentlemen.
Thanks Joe. It's been a pleasure.

102
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,740
We had a great workout today. We are
changing, exchanging some thoughts.

103
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:17,180
Retro Rogan, man. That's, that's our new
term. Retro Rogan. Well, those tickets,

104
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,470
what we're talking about is a martial
arts techniques that were a part of what

105
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:25,010
you would consider a traditional
martial arts like taekwondo or karate,

106
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:28,400
that a lot of these techniques are
starting to find their way into MMA.

107
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,820
And so the arcs and kicked
and kicked by Raymond Daniels,

108
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,490
knock out of the century.
A Ed Cory 16. Yeah,

109
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:39,260
he threw this Raymond Daniels who was a,
a guy who had a background and karate.

110
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,850
Is that as it is? He took karate
or taekwondo. Kempo. Kempo similar.

111
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,280
Not unlike a MMA open martial
arts tournaments. Even
though you have one style,

112
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:52,520
everyone's got to learn how to do it so
everyone knows how to spin kick and so

113
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:55,430
forth. Um, that was an
incredible kick. Yeah,

114
00:06:55,431 --> 00:07:00,431
he threw like a sidekick with his right
leg and then in the middle of the air

115
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:05,810
spun and hit the guy with a spinning side
kick in the face with his left leg was

116
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:10,010
just beautiful to watch. Go look it
up on Youtube. It's incredible. Yeah,

117
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:11,330
we'll pull it up.
Raymond Daniel.

118
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,000
We might've played it on the
podcast because it was so awesome,

119
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:18,310
like after it had happened
to Raymond Daniels, uh, k Oh,

120
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,300
it's just wild, wild kick. And
it was a crazy fight before that,

121
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,600
that he was in this wild exchange,
caught the guy with a punch, heard him,

122
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:30,380
dropped him, and then finished him off
of this wild kid it and style. Actually,

123
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:34,610
I mean, you look at some of the,
we were talking MMA kicks. Yeah,

124
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,730
I'll test.
So now even some cool stuff.

125
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,170
Some of my favorite spin kicks in
kickboxing. We're Stefan Leco verse,

126
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,010
uh, Badr Hari one in Amsterdam. He,

127
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,820
he knocked Badr Hari out with a back kick.
Then that was June of oh five.

128
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,490
Then November, November,
December of [inaudible] Five,

129
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,590
her Hari came back and knocked him
out with a wheel kick. And then, uh,

130
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:59,630
I think a year later,
uh,

131
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,560
Peter Graham knocked out Badr her
with a rolling thunder kick. I mean,

132
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:06,580
people don't think of that, those types
of moves and kickboxing, but yeah,

133
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:09,610
people are using them. High
level guys, if you could do,

134
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,510
we were just one of the things
we were talking about today.

135
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:15,540
If you can do the traditional techniques,
like in mode,

136
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,920
in kickboxing, leg kicks,
knees, all those things.

137
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,280
If you're good at all those things,
then you can add those things to your,

138
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,460
to your repertoire. The rolling
thunder kicks that wheel kicks.

139
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,220
So we're starting to see that a
little bit more and kickboxing,

140
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:31,600
but a lot more in MMA and MMA
it's become a big weapon. Yeah.

141
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,230
I think an MMA is just so wide open
because of there's so many weapons on the

142
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:37,064
battlefield.

143
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,640
I think it's easier to catch people
with them because you don't know it's a

144
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,690
takedown. Four ounce gloves changes
everything the size of the cage,

145
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,210
they move around a little
more. It makes it, I, I,

146
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,850
it's a controlled chaos
in there and I enjoy that.

147
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,090
I can kind of get crazy with striking.
Well,

148
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:56,790
do you think is that you're in a really
interesting too because you're, you're,

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,600
I mean,

150
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,320
people think of the UFC
as being established sport
and it most certainly is,

151
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:04,830
it's on Fox. It's on paper
view. You know, you say UFC,

152
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:08,160
everybody knows what you're talking
about. Pretty much mainstream. However,

153
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,200
it's still in this growth stage as
far as the techniques themselves.

154
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,750
No one has,
like if you're playing football,

155
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,770
there's pretty much everybody plays
football. Like a football player.

156
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,770
You don't see people
doing anything you'd like,

157
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:27,000
where the fuck did that come from?
But in MMA on any given night,

158
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,120
you'll see some crazy submission
that no one's ever done before.

159
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,560
You'll see someone do some crazy flying
kick that no one's ever attempted before.

160
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,970
You, you see things that you'll
see them for the first time ever,

161
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,500
like in a match and you go, that's the
first time. Like perfect example, um,

162
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,960
Mitch Clark pulled off a,

163
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,680
a a Darce choke from the
bottom against a ally Quinta.

164
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,190
And no one had never done that before.
No history of the UFC.

165
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,410
Nobody had ever pulled off
a Darce like a guard pass.

166
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:59,970
Doris like Jeff Glover hits that,
that move all the time.

167
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,740
Guard pass Doris in an MMA fight.
No one's ever done it from the bottom.

168
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,670
That's what I enjoy about
MMA. Like I said, the chaos,
something new is happening.

169
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,360
I mean,

170
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,040
I remember when Alan Belcher and on
the Tanwin says Nanako would call them,

171
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,340
but my man Alan Belcher hit that Superman
Punch at the UFC 100 and that was kind

172
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:23,010
of the beginning of even our
little evolution of, of doing it.

173
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:27,840
And then Anthony did it
against bark, Pella Chesky he
did a superman punch in WC.

174
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:32,430
And then of course is showtime
kick against role where
you actually use the cage

175
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,690
to sweep rower. I mean you were at
our old Jimmy saw small. It was,

176
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,770
and that's where a lot of
our like, uh, you know,

177
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,920
birth of those techniques.
And I told you how it started.

178
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,710
It's a blend of wound Bach and the
movie, the Lords of Dogtown, uh, the,

179
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:52,040
the documentary on it, like how they
change skating and I just, I dunno,

180
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,730
I got an a cloudy little phase where I,

181
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:59,180
I just wound Barack ran off the cage
then all these other techniques and,

182
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,810
and here we are.
I actually,

183
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,160
I mean I'm not bs and when I say to
Anthony as like another 10 moves he can do

184
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,760
off the cage, it's awesome.
Oh, I believe it was it,

185
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,240
that was the thing about the showtime kick
was that it was pretty clear after he,

186
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,770
after he threw the kick and
then after he talked about it,

187
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:16,020
this is not a technique they
just came up with on the fly.

188
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,130
This is something that they had
drilled. Oh yeah. It was so funny.

189
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,760
September before that fight,
um, he did a shoot with, uh,

190
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,920
the UFC magazine and he was doing the
kick off the wall on the pads and then

191
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,990
they're all like, stop. I'm
like, what did we do wrong?

192
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,030
We want to get our iPhones out the film,
this,

193
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:36,570
they're loving all the cool things here.
He's doing. And then the, in that camp,

194
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,960
he was doing it a lot off the wall with
his training partners. I mean, uh, I,

195
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,190
I love Anthony's, my really good
friend. We're close. He's a,

196
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,940
he's a god rather than my little
daughter and he's so open minded.

197
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,030
I'll show him something and people
look at him like, yeah, right.

198
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,030
I remember my really good friend
a Giuseppe. I was up at his place.

199
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:58,270
I was shown the showtime kick
at a seminar, the seminar
before. Everyone's like,

200
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:02,350
there's no way. And I got so many texts
after the vite. Yeah, you were right.

201
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,670
You know, I love that. I mean,
um, you know, it's again,

202
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:08,080
like you're talking about who,

203
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,440
who would've thought Alan Belcher
did what he did against Paul Harris.

204
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,330
He put them in the twist or almost
finished him with the twister and then not

205
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,900
again, we've seen, uh, the
Korean Zombie catch up.

206
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,870
Leonard Garcia with the twist or, I mean,
these are all moves would be obvious.

207
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,890
Doesn't work. I think anything works if
you train it enough. Yeah. And we'll,

208
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,460
the Paul Harris fight was really
interesting with Alan Belcher because Paul

209
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,400
Harris is known for being this
terrifying leg lock master.

210
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,560
Nobody wants to go to the ground with
them cause you go to the ground with him.

211
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:36,820
He just ripped guys and legs apart.

212
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,420
I mean you saw it in his world
series of fighting premiere. Oh yeah.

213
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,810
Fought for 30 seconds.
Got Ahold of the guy's lag,

214
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,460
rips his ligaments apart, its death.
I call him the Mike Tyson a of of,

215
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,470
of grappling like people fear,
grappling him.

216
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,680
There's not a lot of guys
that people were like, I fear,

217
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:57,220
but he has that Mike Tyson esque approach.
Aw Man,

218
00:12:57,221 --> 00:13:01,990
my legs going to be toast. You know, I
remember in the fight, no Alan. Oh wait,

219
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:04,230
keep doing that. You're doing great. Yeah.

220
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,510
When he went to the ground with them
and it was engaging them with leg locks,

221
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:09,940
I was like, this is crazy. Like
he's going to get submitted here.

222
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:13,570
He's going to get his leg ripped apart.
But Alan had perfect defense.

223
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,400
It was one step ahead the entire way.

224
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:19,030
You could really see that he had studied
Paul Harris his game and just knew how

225
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,450
to defend it and it just was with him
every step of the way and then beat him

226
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,670
down. Oh No. That was fun. Again,

227
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,250
I love having people do things that
people can't or don't think they can do.

228
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,980
I did an interview with Ron
Kirk and inside MMA, um,

229
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,620
rate the week of Anthony's fight with
Henderson. They said, so how's the Viking?

230
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,010
I go down and he's going
to beat him with striking.

231
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:42,250
I said he's gonna beat him anyway once
they're like, yeah, right. I'm, I'm,

232
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:44,770
I'm telling you,
he can submit Ben Henderson,

233
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:49,771
who was the closest ever to submitting
Ben Henderson before he did Anthony.

234
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,150
Exactly. Almost caught him with a good
team right back. Yep. So the guillotine,

235
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:58,900
any Ed, uh, the rear
naked choke. So, you know,

236
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,030
I love instilling that.
Never put limits on yourself.

237
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,481
You know what I mean?

238
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:07,540
You talk about it in your broadcast
and if you're world class at one thing,

239
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,910
you can decide to be world
class in another thing.

240
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,230
You take that drive you had that got you
to be a worldclass martial artists in

241
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:15,910
this discipline. Go put
it. And the other one,

242
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,900
well I think people forget too with
Anthony Pettis who's the current UFC

243
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:20,770
lightweight champion.

244
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,370
People forget how good his ground game
his cause he's so scary standing up.

245
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,790
They think of him as the guy who knocked
out Joe Lozan with a head kick knocked

246
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,530
out,
Donald's Serone with a liver kick.

247
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,160
They think of him as this devastating
kicker, which you most certainly is,

248
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,300
but they forget about his
triangle of Shane Roller.

249
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,290
They forget about his wicked ground game
that he showed in the first Henderson

250
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:45,610
fight where he took his back. He had his
back for a full round. I believe him.

251
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,820
I'm going to look them up quick.
He might have more wins by submission.

252
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:52,310
The knockout actually that's crazy.
People forget for whatever

253
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,310
reason they don't think of his ground
game as like the same level as they think

254
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,270
of his striking game.
And it's just,

255
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,290
it's because it's striking game is so
scary because everybody's afraid of

256
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,130
getting knocked out. And his, uh,

257
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,540
his striking game is very
unique in its effectiveness.

258
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,220
Well,

259
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,220
what I love about a lot of the guys that
trained mostly all the guys and Gals,

260
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:18,730
they're trained, they're very open minded.
They want to get better all the time.

261
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,310
Anthony's had a little downtime,
he couldn't kick.

262
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:25,900
So he's becoming a master boxes.
Sit Up there. 15 submissions,

263
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:30,780
65% by submission. Yup. There you go.
That's crazy. Yeah. Uh, you know, it's,

264
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:34,210
it's, uh, I, I love the
change. You know, again,

265
00:15:34,211 --> 00:15:37,010
everyone's worried about the knock off.
He wants to go to the Mat, you know?

266
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,160
Yeah. He can do it. All.
A kid can do it all.

267
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:42,910
It's gotta be nice for you to like train
having trained that guy like from the

268
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:47,911
jump and to see him like flourish and
become the Wec champion and then the UFC

269
00:15:49,211 --> 00:15:52,360
champion in such a spectacular way.
That's got to be beautiful.

270
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,350
Yeah. I mean, I,

271
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,530
I started crying slightly in Milwaukee
in the octagon tears of joy. I mean,

272
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,580
if anyone deserved it. He did. He's
got a great attitude. He's a cool kid.

273
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:05,890
I always say it's the coolest famous
guy. No, I mean, wherever else we go. He,

274
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,650
everyone knows him as the guy who
jumped off the cage, he showtime.

275
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,520
But to me it's just a Anthony, this really
cool kid when he's at our academies,

276
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,810
just mellow when he's in his element.
He's a very humble guy,

277
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,360
but that's what makes them
great. You know, he's, he,

278
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,960
we might go to Thailand and do some
cross training with saint shy. Um,

279
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,740
I want to talk to Nick Holt can from
Gloria and, and having like Anthony,

280
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,190
he's hungry to train with everyone.

281
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,860
One of his best friends from
Milwaukee's on the money team.

282
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,650
One of the top boxers sees eight
and old for Floyd Mayweather.

283
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:37,760
So while he's in Vegas,

284
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,700
during the ultimate fighter is going
to be training with the money team too.

285
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,170
I mean, this is the type of guy he's a,
wants to be a master martial artists.

286
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,430
So he's trying to train with the best
core. Are you guys best Muay Thai boxers,

287
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:52,970
wrestling, Jujitsu, you
name it. He'll do it. Yeah,

288
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,380
and that's what we were talking
about before. This sport is

289
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,720
really evolving and growing
and developing and you know,

290
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:01,540
in a lot of ways he
represents a new element.

291
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:06,570
He represents like the taekwondo stylist
who got really good at everything else

292
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,270
and now has that weapon
above everybody else.

293
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,930
Everybody can Moitai everybody can
do Jujitsu, everybody can wrestle,

294
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,860
but not everybody can throw kicks
like him on top of all those things.

295
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,630
And he's one of the few guys is known
like, like very cro cop, like in a way,

296
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:27,310
you know, no one for just
devastating kicks. That's a,
that's a big weapon to have.

297
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,990
What I love, what I love about kicks,
they're very unpredictable strikes.

298
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:33,750
And when they hit you and they
didn't land, they still hurt.

299
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:38,430
You hit your arm and you're like, what
was that? You know, I love that look.

300
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:42,540
I'm fighters face when he kicks him
and it's like the look in their face.

301
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,900
Like what? Wait a minute. I'm
not supposed to feel like that

302
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,050
dude. You were demonstrating
shit on me today. Just lightly me

303
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,940
demonstrating shit. There's the
kicks to my forearm. Just just,

304
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,910
just popping the Shin into
my farm. It's like, ah,

305
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,890
your arms starts going numb and you're
barely hitting me. Barely hitting my leg.

306
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:05,910
Just, just thumping it. Just a little
bit of that. And it's like, man,

307
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,550
you can't even for the average person,

308
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,140
they really have no idea what it would
feel like if a guy like pedis or garlic,

309
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:17,890
you leg kicked him. They have no fucking
idea how hard that would be. Well,

310
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,700
even let's think about Anderson
shattering his leg and Tyrone Spong. Yeah.

311
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,060
Like when I was at the glory fight, we're
Tyrone Spong. Uh, I knew right away,

312
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,010
I'm like,
the fights over.

313
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,970
You can hear it was like being at a
baseball game and you hear the crack of a

314
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:36,600
bat, you know? That's all you heard
that Oh yeah, I heard it right away.

315
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,580
It was a very ugly sound.

316
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,810
And you know that that's
a one dip. Like, oh,

317
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:46,530
explain combat sports. Like I always
get people, one's better than the other.

318
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,690
They're all freaking crazy.

319
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,640
I think it's crazy to have to do eight
Jujitsu mantras in a data when the world,

320
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:54,474
some Jujitsu.

321
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,220
I think it's crazy to have to do 10
minute rounds and Abu Dhabi's and how many

322
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,480
studs? I mean, it's crazy
to win an NCAA championship.

323
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:05,340
How many matches over how many days?

324
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,510
It's crazy to box 12 rounds and get
punched in the Dome for 12 rounds.

325
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,630
It's crazy to get elbowed and clinched.
And Thailand,

326
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:16,590
it's crazy to to win a glory tournament.
It's crazy to MMA.

327
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:20,070
They're all tough in their own right.
I've, well I respect each one of them.

328
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:22,230
But when it comes to striking,

329
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,700
I think the most brutal thing you'll
ever do striking wise as an eight man

330
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,920
tournament,
which happened in glory this weekend,

331
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:32,660
cause you gotta beat three dudes in one
night. So you got to like, imagine you,

332
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,970
you kicked me really hard.
My arms jacked. Well I won,

333
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:39,720
but my right arm doesn't work. Wait
a minute, you kicked my left leg.

334
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,430
My hand's broken.
I mean,

335
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,270
I've never been able to win
a beat three guys in a night.

336
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:47,850
I've tried and it's tough.
I'm better at single fights,

337
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,660
but these guys who go out there and can
beat three guys in one night and find

338
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,620
that the nuts to do it,
I don't know how they do it still.

339
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,890
I only fought kickboxing three
times and it was all in one night.

340
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,370
I fought in a tournament like that.
Oh Wow. I won the first fight,

341
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:04,850
won the second fight and I
lost in the finals. And you,

342
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:08,490
you're so beat up by the time it gets
to the files, your body, it's just done.

343
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,690
It's like you're, you're, it's like
fighting with the flu. It's like fighting.

344
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,330
You just,
there's nothing left you,

345
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,270
you're a shadow of yourself and
plus you have time to cool off.

346
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,850
That's getting that adrenaline kicked
in again. It's like, I remember, um,

347
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,640
2001 I fought in Vegas.
I knocked out two mosque.

348
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,910
Who's for Shooski right away I felt
great. Like, whoop, celebrate. Oh Shit.

349
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,840
Hey asshole, you got to fight
again. Sorry, I got to go get up.

350
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,470
But Mike McDonald and your
body cools down. You know,

351
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:39,310
you've got to be able to control,
you know,

352
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,240
I mean I love and then knock
the guy out so you get so high,

353
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,210
there's no better feeling than finishing
someone in a fight. So you're like,

354
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,140
oh wait, tone down dude, you got
two more fights to win. You know,

355
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,980
and it's a special thing.
I think that is the wildest feet.

356
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:56,800
Another crazy sport to
me is Kyle Keshon karate.

357
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,480
I was at an all Japan karate championship
and I've never seen those guys are the

358
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:05,040
most insane people. They just sit
there and you kicked me, I kick you,

359
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,920
you punched me with bare knuckle and to
one of us falls down and we'll fight 16

360
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:12,430
guys in it. It's a really inefficient way
to fight though. I don't understand it.

361
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:15,580
Well, I punching to the face
and punching to the body.

362
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:19,240
They're standing right in front of each
other. I just think, not all of them,

363
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,560
you know, there's the great
ones like Andy hugged, right?

364
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,450
Michael Thompson who you know,
were more effective. You know,

365
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,800
they move around and you know,
that's actually GSPS core discipline.

366
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,300
Um, you know, there, there
are guys who really get into
the Butoh. I'm not into it.

367
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:38,350
I think it's more dangerous. And
Moy, Tai, you know, it's uh, me,

368
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:39,720
the style I love might die,

369
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,140
but the style I've always related to is
the evasive fighters who hit and don't

370
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:47,870
get hit. I mean, that's my rule. I'd like
to hit you a lot and please never hit me.

371
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,740
Well, I think we're seeing that more
reinforced in appreciated more in MMA.

372
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,440
There was a period of time
that was disturbing to me.

373
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,780
We're guys were just banging,
you know,

374
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:01,720
I remember I read some guy's Twitter
account who was a really nice guy and I

375
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:06,280
read something. He wrote something
about like, fuck, technical striking.

376
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,000
You know, I think what you do is
you get out to you, if you're a man,

377
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:12,190
you stand in the center
of the cage and you bang,

378
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,380
you meet each other side of
the cage and bang and let the,

379
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,920
let the chips fall where they may. And
I'm like, that is the craziest debts.

380
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:23,530
So I can't even tell you how dumb that is.
That's like saying fuck steering.

381
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:25,900
When you're on a race car,
fuck steering,

382
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,110
you just fucking hit that gas and
whoever gets to the finish line,

383
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:33,460
that gets to the finish line. That's so
ridiculous. Like you have to be technical,

384
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,480
otherwise you're not.
You're not, you're, you're,

385
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,800
you're not doing it your best.

386
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,000
What you're doing is you're handicapping
yourself for machismo for bravado.

387
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:46,270
Like what? Why would you stand in front
of a guy and trade blows with them?

388
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,410
There's a, there is a chronic
problem. I'd say right now an MMA,

389
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,890
there's a lot of fighters who have
had some cerebral issues and you know,

390
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,140
I think Martin Kampmann
it's taking some time off.

391
00:22:56,141 --> 00:23:00,010
I know I can't say a few other fighters
I know of that I've heard and I'm not

392
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,590
sure if it's public,
they've taken time off from,

393
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,060
from taking too many blows and
l your thing, that should be,

394
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,550
I thought martial arts
is about self defense.

395
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,310
If we really get to the
root of martial arts, it's,

396
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,780
we're not to get your ass kicked.
And I think the defense is everything.

397
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:20,980
The greatest fighters in every
discipline of all at defense. You know,

398
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:25,330
and I think whether it's
grappling, weather, great
wrestlers don't get taken down.

399
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:27,550
Great Jujitsu guys don't get submitted.
Great.

400
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:31,870
Kickboxers don't get knocked out may
whether it doesn't get hit. Um, you know,

401
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,180
like you're saying,
it's easy to get,

402
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,300
I went through a stage in
my career where yeah man,

403
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:39,400
I'm going to go out there and
put on a show and you know,

404
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:41,680
I'm just going to bleed for the crowd.
Well you know what,

405
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,430
when you're done bleeding, you put the
show on, uh, it doesn't help your career.

406
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,680
I'm not saying fight boring,
but um,

407
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,400
like just purposely going out
there and making it exciting.

408
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,010
Yeah, making it over exciting. Umaine
you can be exciting and not get hit.

409
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,890
I mean that's what I try and teach my
guys. You know, if you're getting hit,

410
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:05,540
you're losing. Well it is an art form
and it sounds crazy to call Marshall.

411
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,490
I mean the,
the term martial arts,

412
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,590
it seems to a lot of people
to be an inaccurate term
or a term that doesn't seem

413
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:13,760
to make sense cause it's fighting.

414
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,900
But the artistic aspect
of it is the performance.

415
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,830
Like if you see a guy like Anderson
Silva fight only flood Stephan Bonner,

416
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,380
that was a beautiful artistic performance.

417
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,640
It was art because he's creating on
the spot he's created, he's putting,

418
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,450
he's got this series of moves
that his body knows how to do.

419
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,280
He is techniques he knows how to utilize,

420
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:38,990
but it's all about putting them together
against an unwilling opponent in the

421
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:43,991
middle of a competition in the middle
of a cage where you're on broadcasting

422
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,860
front of fucking millions of people
worldwide and to pull it all off in this

423
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:53,540
incredibly perfect way. It's a work
of art like definitely it's beautiful.

424
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,570
You go and watch it over and over again.
You could see it on TV,

425
00:24:56,571 --> 00:25:00,530
you'll see the highlights and it's just
like watching a dance or not even a

426
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:04,660
dance. I don't dance is not that
impressive. No film, music, comedy. It's,

427
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:09,050
it is art because it's an expression
of your soul. You know? It's usually,

428
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,080
I do really stress the art part.

429
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,760
I want my athletes to express
who they are, you know?

430
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,560
I mean that that's what they're doing.

431
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,610
That's the canvas of the octagon
or the ring is that they're,

432
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,290
they're little canvas too.

433
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,620
I mean you get a chance to put to film
in front of the world what you are,

434
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:34,640
who you are, you know, cause the way you
fight represents your personality. Yeah.

435
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:39,200
And if you see those moments where a guy's
hitting someone and can't be hit back

436
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:44,150
like the famous video of Anderson Fighting
Forrest Griffin where he's bobbing

437
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:45,080
and weaving in front of him,

438
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:47,600
forest has hitting an air and
then Anderson cracks some like,

439
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,810
like they're both fighting
at two different speeds,

440
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,950
two different frequencies. Anderson's
just in this complete different level.

441
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,370
That's art. It's beautiful
to watch. That's reminiscent,

442
00:25:58,371 --> 00:25:59,780
I watch a lot of old boxing.

443
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:04,640
I Love Sugar Ray Robinson films and
obviously reminiscent of the great Allie.

444
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:08,270
I mean he, he could do things
that other people can do.

445
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:11,090
That's why that's what makes
fighters special. You know,

446
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,010
any fighter can sit there and get beat up.

447
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,920
But I think that's why we talk
about people like Silva Ali,

448
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,000
you know, and now like I said, there's
guys coming up in glory that are special.

449
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,890
I mean even, you know, my favorite
fighter, some of you guys might not know,

450
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,800
uh, look up a guy named
[inaudible] rune. Um,

451
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,820
he's from sit your dog camp.
He's one of my Moitai idols,

452
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:37,190
but he's a WBC boxing champion.

453
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,930
He dodged 13 punches and um,
he,

454
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:44,010
uh,
w knocked a guy out with one

455
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,450
punch. It's s a m, a r t
and look up 13 punches.

456
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:51,820
I trained in timeline. It was why
rob calm and was friends with them.

457
00:26:51,821 --> 00:26:56,300
But if we bring this video up, it is bad
ass boxing. It used to be Moitai champ.

458
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,300
He's probably one of the best ever and
Moitai why he didn't get hit. But again,

459
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:04,950
that style is able to dodge, move,
evade, hit people, not get hit.

460
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:08,280
And that's what makes striking fun.
Yeah. Here he is right here. Yeah.

461
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:12,600
Watch this gang. Look at this. This is my
idol. If anyone wants to know who I love,

462
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,250
I went to train in Thailand
at his gym because of him.

463
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,150
There's an that's amazing.
That is beautiful.

464
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,730
Bang and the fights over. Yeah, that's,

465
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:29,100
that's incredible. That's actually
want to Anthony's idols to,

466
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:33,570
and our couple of more guys really,
uh, I have a vault. Are you, I mean,

467
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:38,010
back in the day I didn't have TV.
I didn't have an antenna,

468
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,070
so all I did was watch VHS tapes.
I've lived at my gym,

469
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,200
so I watched fight Thai
fights, Dutch fights, Japanese,

470
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,550
like, uh, you know,

471
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:51,030
how a good musician or any other
artists' lives with their craft.

472
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:52,440
That's how I mastered my craft.

473
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:54,810
I watched fight after fight
after fight after fight.

474
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,390
That fight is a perfect
example. That was art. Yeah.

475
00:27:57,391 --> 00:28:00,630
I mean I can find so many different
fights like that. That's what I do.

476
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:05,300
I send a lot of videos to all my
guys. I send, I exposed them to. Um,

477
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,700
one of my favorite compliments is
when Alan Belcher fought, uh, uh,

478
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,410
Patrick Otay, everyone goes, yeah. Mainly
it looks like Yo turn Clyde fairtex hose.

479
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,370
And matter of fact,

480
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,730
he studied Yo 10 Clyde to a t to I'll
take a fighter and have my athletes study

481
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:25,680
that for that particular game plan.
And I'll see you're going to do this.

482
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:27,640
Use this technique, you know, uh,

483
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,260
a technique that Anthony and Serge have
been doing is the hands thing kick a

484
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,790
Sanchez or king star from Thailand.
They're trying to land that. They're both,

485
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,770
they're having a race. Who the hands?
Yeah, we're the cartwheel the hands. Yeah.

486
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:44,590
It's a cool move from [inaudible]
the old school. But Sam Chai, s a.

487
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,470
E. N. C. H. A. I um, he,
he's a bad ass. He's from,

488
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:53,760
from the Jackie. Jim. Hey,
here's a good question. If
you're doing a cartwheel kick,

489
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:56,460
like say if you're standing,
if you got one hand down,

490
00:28:56,461 --> 00:29:00,390
if our t and you're throwing a kick,
are you down?

491
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,320
Is that a downed opponent? They get
let you get away with it and boy tie.

492
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,270
But I believe technically it is.

493
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,600
So you're not supposed to be able to kick
the guy in the face when you're a down.

494
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:14,200
No, you're right. Ah, here we go,
Bob. Yeah, look familiar guys. Yeah.

495
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,160
But what I'm saying is like,
say if he's thrown that kick,

496
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,840
the guy who he's kicking can't kick him
in the face when his hand is touching

497
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:25,830
the ground. Yeah. Right. Uh,
technically I believe so,

498
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,930
but that's what you would want to do.

499
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:31,630
You'd want to step in and kick him in
the face and his hand soccer kick round.

500
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:36,450
Anybody's on one limb. I
think there, if you do that,

501
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:40,860
that I don't, I hate an MMA when guys
play the game, you know, touched I'm down.

502
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:42,220
I'm not done. I'm done. I'm gonna explain

503
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,980
that for focusing on, no, you're not
allowed to need it down to opponent.

504
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,000
Like what a down deponent means is you
can need a guy in the face when he's

505
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:53,980
standing up, but once the guys on the
ground, if he has a knee on the ground,

506
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,800
uh, and one hand, as long as it's,

507
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,710
as long as it's anything other
than your feet on the ground,

508
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:03,670
you can have one knee on the
ground and you're okay. Right?

509
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:05,650
You could need a guy in the face
with one knee on the ground,

510
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:08,620
but as soon as his hand touches
three points, right? Yes. What it is.

511
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,820
So what you'll see guys standing up and
they'll reach down and just touch the

512
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:17,200
ground just to keep from getting kneed
in the face where you can, you can,

513
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:21,430
you need a guy in the face when it, if
he's got one knee and one leg. No, no.

514
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:24,010
The knee has to be up.
The fee.

515
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:28,510
They have to be up because you
have to be honest feet only.

516
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,240
Like if you get down to
one knee, no, no hands,

517
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:33,700
but one day you can't be a guy
in the face. All right. Yeah.

518
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:37,270
There's some weird rules, man. Well the,
the, the 12 to six elbow, like you said,

519
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,570
Thomas, stupid cause we could
see some killer techniques.

520
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:44,740
That's where we'd see even more Moitai
elbows because then I would have my guys

521
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:48,790
climb the old school Moitai
and dropped the double elbows.

522
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,860
I'm the the cage. Oh yeah. Oh
yeah, definitely. Yeah, for sure.

523
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:58,600
I mean I'm all about it. I love those
techniques. Well, that technique is,

524
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,640
that is really one of the most ridiculous
rules ever. And the reason why it's in,

525
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:04,540
for folks who don't know,

526
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:09,490
the 12 to six meaning an elbow that comes
from like the 12 o'clock down to six

527
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:10,324
o'clock.

528
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,810
The reason why it's outlawed is because
when they tried to get mixed martial

529
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:16,660
arts past, they brought it to the
athletic commissions and they said,

530
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:19,720
well you can't have that one
technique Coz I saw it on ESPN.

531
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,430
There was a guy breaking bricks with it.

532
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,820
No way you can allow people to do
that because they could kill somebody.

533
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,230
And so they went all right as if this
has anything more powerful than this,

534
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,200
which is probably more Po. No, I
think when you're on the ground,

535
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:35,500
the downward album was the most
vicious drag. Do you get a fault?

536
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,490
I think that like getting it,

537
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,350
that's why another thing when Alan bead,
Paula,

538
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:44,620
Horace and the fight before that
he beat Mcdonald on the Mat.

539
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,720
We really been working on our
ground and pound on our team. Um,

540
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:51,850
cause it's another place to beat
someone up. It's also so ridiculous.

541
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,200
You're not allowed to do with like
a 12 six elbow to the thigh. Yeah.

542
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,590
That's so crazy.

543
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:01,120
Like if a guy's in your God you
can't do a 12 six elbow to his thigh.

544
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,500
It's just, it makes, if, if it were
me, I'd love to have soccer kicks.

545
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,450
Well do you think that soccer
kicks though? They had him
in pride and I liked it.

546
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,820
I liked it.
But what I don't think,

547
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,870
I think in pride you were in a ring and
you get your head could slip under the

548
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:21,100
ropes. You can get away from stuff and
the in the UFC that cage would like,

549
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,370
you'd be mashed up if someone's
soccer kicked your head. You're right,

550
00:32:24,371 --> 00:32:27,500
you're right. I forgot about that. Yeah.

551
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,350
The problem is you can't move. It
was an open space. Say if you fought,

552
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:37,530
like say if every fight took place
in like a basketball sized arena,

553
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,600
like a basketball court was plenty of
room to move around, but there's no cage.

554
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,200
That would be really interesting. You
know, it'd be really interesting if they,

555
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:48,860
if they, if people fought
like that because then take
downs would be completely

556
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:49,251
different.

557
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:52,910
Getting back up would be much harder
cause getting back up against the cage now

558
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,740
has gotten to a real art form.

559
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:58,280
Guys figured out how to press their back
up against the cage and use it to stand

560
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:00,230
back up and postop and get,

561
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,230
once they get that under hook and they
get one hand down there popping up like

562
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,064
crazy.

563
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,650
No I, it's crazy. They're it guys
are getting way better at wrestling.

564
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:11,370
Way better at Jujitsu faster.
Again, I think it's technology.

565
00:33:11,371 --> 00:33:15,690
There's so much knowledge out there.
There's so much.

566
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:20,790
I mean when I was trying to learn
Moitai besides going to Thailand,

567
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,310
watching videos,
who was such a slow process,

568
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,240
I remember my friends when they first
like it was a big deal to have a blue belt

569
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:30,210
around and Jujitsu and now it,
you know,

570
00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:33,310
there's black belts everywhere and
the knowledge is everywhere guys.

571
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,141
So get a bravo.

572
00:33:34,141 --> 00:33:38,280
He has a site where he sent it out info
and you can check out techniques and

573
00:33:38,281 --> 00:33:42,600
there's so much going on with that
and just youtube and everything else.

574
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,590
It's on TV too.

575
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,800
You know how the kids learn how to play
basketball in America on the playground.

576
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,900
How do they learn how to play on the
playground? They watch TV. You know,

577
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,680
people are doing this stuff everywhere,

578
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,520
whether they're in an organized school or
just friends and their garage training,

579
00:33:56,521 --> 00:33:57,354
it's happening.

580
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,720
Well there's so much information now.
Whereas when I was a kid,

581
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:04,290
you would buy a book on a martial
art or you know, you'd never,

582
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:09,060
it was very rare that you would get a
really good like VHS tape martial arts

583
00:34:09,061 --> 00:34:13,350
back then because when I was a kid I was
training in the 80s I don't think there

584
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,220
were any instructional martial
arts tapes that I wasn't aware of.

585
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,310
You had to go to a school,

586
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,910
you had to go to a school and learn
from somebody and then occasionally you

587
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:22,520
would get fight videos and
then you would watch, you know,

588
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,780
try to emulate like Benny the jet,
you know,

589
00:34:24,781 --> 00:34:29,280
like try to be like Benny the jet or
Kitezh or you know, one of those guys.

590
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:31,800
It was fighting back then. That
was like really, really good.

591
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,300
My first, uh, instructional
tapes I had, cause I,

592
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:39,600
I still watch everything. I'm,
I'm a student of the game was uh,

593
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:43,970
a guy by the name of put bad noise.
You mean his name's the golden leg.

594
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,730
Five time Roger Down during
champion and lived in France.

595
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:48,470
That was my first Moy Tai Instructional.

596
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:53,660
And I luckily got a chance to go
train it as GM and in Paris. And then,

597
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:54,620
uh,
the other one was,

598
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,000
I don't know if you remember the Chocker
Riki [inaudible] Tom [inaudible] and

599
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,190
you know,
young Peter Arts is in there,

600
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:04,250
Bronco sick it tick and Gilbert Valentini.

601
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:08,540
So those are like my first
kind of core hell cause I,

602
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,130
20 years ago this year, I went to
Thailand. You want to hear irony though?

603
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,580
A friend of mine, his name is
Rambo, he fights MMA. He's, uh,

604
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,720
one of the top one 15 ers in the world,

605
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,220
but he's tie look up Rambo on r a m B,

606
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:28,730
a Rambo Moitai.
He's the crazy dancer.

607
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,140
The first fight I ever went to. When I
got the timeline, I took my bags rate to,

608
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:38,120
to um, the hotel and I walked into
[inaudible]. I walk in and he's

609
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:43,020
one of the main fights that night. Irony
is, he fights them. I may now, it's just,

610
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:45,060
I don't know.
It's one of those weird destinies.

611
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,180
The first fight card I see in Thailand
is Rambod and now he's fighting and MMA.

612
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:54,410
Yeah. Yeah. And I mean there's,
you're finding for out of
it, he lives in Japan. He,

613
00:35:54,411 --> 00:35:58,920
he, I think he fought you least
Gomez at tachy. Yeah. Yeah.

614
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:02,790
He fought. Uh, sorry. I was going
to call them as a Eugene name.

615
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,500
All my useless. What's up
underground? I'm on there.

616
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,550
I'm on there. Yeah, I know. I know. I
see you on there. Yeah, it's a event.

617
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,510
I know it's been a little shady on there
lately. We're a lot of Douche bags.

618
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,690
We got it.
So it's not turning into that other thing.

619
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,600
Well, you know what it
is, man. You can't, if,

620
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,910
if it's on the Internet
and anybody could sign up,

621
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,430
anybody can sign up and
if anybody gets signed up,

622
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:27,830
you're just going to get a lot of
shitheads. If people are anonymous,

623
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,210
it's almost impossible to keep any forum
completely clear of shitheads unless

624
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:35,720
you just start banning people and then
you worry about censorship and why are

625
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:36,554
people banning?
Yeah,

626
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,830
I'm lucky. Everyone's really nice
to me. Um, you know, it's cool. Uh,

627
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,670
it's been a good time. We want bring up
that video. There's a couple of them,

628
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,440
maybe a highlight of them.
It's Rambo highlight cause dude,

629
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,090
he has his own little crazy style.
He does the worm,

630
00:36:52,091 --> 00:36:54,640
he does the running man after his fights.
He's really fun,

631
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,080
entertaining Guy Ran Bob.
His name literally means are crazy dancer.

632
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,210
Now what do you think about

633
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:03,280
there's a, there's a thing
going on right now where, uh,

634
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,150
people are talking about this is him,
what people are talking about this uh,

635
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,910
past UFC, which I thought was great.
I loved the mighty mouse fight.

636
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:12,320
I love watching that guy perform,

637
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:16,850
but that a lot of folks don't care to
watch 125 pound fighters and they're

638
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:20,390
saying, um, you know, there's a
rumor on the underground, again,

639
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,740
who knows if it's substantiated,

640
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:26,000
but that the papers you buys were wanting
some of the lowest ever for the UFC,

641
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,960
um, that it was, uh, somewhere around
a hundred thousand pay per view buys,

642
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:33,110
which is really, really
low for the UFC. Um,

643
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,750
do you think that that's what it is?

644
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:38,780
It Americans just do not want
to see these little tiny guys?

645
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,220
I just think the timing was bad this time
around. It was a few weeks coming off.

646
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:46,900
Another big, uh, you
know, fight. I think they,

647
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:51,140
they should just drop a
couple of the paper views per
year. I mean, I'm no expert,

648
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:53,820
but I like it when there's kind
of a buildup for the paper,

649
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:57,710
make the paper view the big bomber. And
then we got all of our good free fights.

650
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,990
You know,
it's kind of like back in the day,

651
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,800
remember Tuesday night fights on the USA.
You've got some Friday night fights.

652
00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:08,450
He got some HBO and now we're going to
have a big pay per view fight, you know,

653
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:12,020
build it up. Just don't have pay for
view fights. Just that paper view finder.

654
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,920
Yeah, it's definitely seems like there's
a lot of fights going on. And you know,

655
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:21,000
one hand it's great as a fight fan. Like
on the 28th we were talking about this,

656
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:24,210
there's two fight cards playing
at the same time or the same day.

657
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:28,530
One from New Zealand and then hours later,
one from Texas,

658
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,290
Jeremy Stephens is going to fight cub
Swanson, great fight, fight, fight.

659
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,990
Ooh, what a crazy fight that is. Stevens

660
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,940
is so fucking creative. You don't talking
about a creative guy in there. Oh yeah.

661
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:44,290
I'm a big fan of called, I really like
what he's doing with his striking.

662
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:49,620
Not only is he doing base kickbox and
he's got some spins and he's honing his

663
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:51,910
boxing as well.
He's really,

664
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,710
and I think that's like a big thing
that a lot of people don't do because I

665
00:38:56,711 --> 00:39:00,520
think it's one of the hardest things
to do. Um, I was talking to Rico,

666
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:04,960
Verhoeven is fighting. Saturday he went
and trained with uh, this guy, Tyson fury.

667
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,240
And he said the first
couple of times he went,

668
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:10,870
I mean he just got lit up like a
Christmas tree by cause that boxers,

669
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:13,190
that's all they do. And that's like, um,

670
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,140
if you go watch someone roll with
Marcello Garcia and you're an MMA fighter,

671
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:19,840
you're going to get crushed. You
know, cause that's all Marcello does.

672
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,830
But I think it,
that's always a cool thing.

673
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:27,100
I love watching people humble
themselves to get better.

674
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:28,270
And that's how you get better.

675
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,300
And cubs working with a worldclass
champion level boxer and it's showing,

676
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,630
well that's a real problem with a lot
of fighters that especially if they come

677
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:39,970
from a kickboxing background,
they don't want to get tapped.

678
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,590
So they don't want to do, they don't want
to do Jujitsu. And they never learned.

679
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,110
There's certain guys that
never got good on the ground.

680
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,500
They'd been doing MMA for 10, 15 years
and there's still a God damn blue belt.

681
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,900
I mean, they just doesn't
ever got good on the ground.

682
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:55,240
He never became lethal on the ground.
And conversely,

683
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,190
there's certain guys who are
grapplers that just suck at standup.

684
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,220
They always suck at stand up.
They just,

685
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,980
their whole game is predicated on
getting a hold of you and turning into a

686
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:07,340
grappling match. But if it stuck
standing up there helpless. Yeah,

687
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,050
I've always looked at any fighting.
Even if your kickboxing,

688
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,210
you gotta know how to do every skill.

689
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:17,170
I know some guys who don't want to train
clinch at all. Well I don't clench.

690
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:21,640
Well learn it so you don't get beat by
it. I know a lot of guys who, you know,

691
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:23,800
knees are stupid. I don't.
Well, you got to learn.

692
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:27,960
What are you going to do when someone
else says knees are stupid that no come or

693
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,660
anybody sees Niesr stupid needs to
watch Travis Browne vs Alistair Overeem.

694
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,910
I know Travis Browne survived that,

695
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:38,650
but Jesus fucking Christ and Alice to
take it to him when he to the body. Oh,

696
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,190
a Bogan stoic. If you want
to watch them, cool knees.

697
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,770
He's fighting Saturday and
the glory tournament he's got,

698
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,140
he did this knee where
he flew out of the ring.

699
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,190
There's a highlight if you
bring up bog down bog, d a, n,

700
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:56,830
a, s, t. O. I. C. I C I believe.

701
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:01,390
Um, but he's, he's sick dude. He
comes out with flying out of the Ray,

702
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:02,870
went over the corner posts.

703
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,660
He missed the knee and he got back up
and whoop the guy's ass. Wow. Yeah,

704
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,920
but he's going to be fun.

705
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:12,790
He's fighting Wayne Baird who kinda
has a wild ass wild. Yeah. Main Guy.

706
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:17,590
I think the, yeah. Here it is. Check this.
Look at this nice knee. We'll get that.

707
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,680
He, he's fighting Saturday. Um, you know,

708
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:23,980
just look at this pile that,

709
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,360
that's the new age of what's
going on with glory. Um, you know,

710
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:33,150
a little bit different. Here we
go. Wow. That's so crazy. Yeah.

711
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:38,000
The dude went completely over the
top madness. Oh, I know. I know.

712
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:41,430
He was just laughing about it today
when I was hanging out with him. Yeah,

713
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,740
he's okay. He could have broke a leg
there. There's a wild fight in Thailand.

714
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:49,980
Will bring you up in a second
there and knocked him out. Look up.

719
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,960
you're in the golden era.
Moitai you spill it,

720
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,680
grab the leg and run them across the ring.

721
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,770
You can't do it anymore because
too many injuries happen.

722
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,520
And I'll show you the fight, why
they can't, the cooling and the cage.

723
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:23,510
You can still do it. But if this
clip comes up that one more time.

727
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:43,700
Wow. And you could run across
the ring. It was called the plow.

728
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,550
Now you can only take a
step into half this fight.

729
00:42:46,551 --> 00:42:50,000
You'll see why the guy actually
broke his back. Oh No. Yeah.

730
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:53,270
This is insane. Yeah. Here we go.

731
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:57,430
So a den is in the Blue Rainbow,
some pump the lake.

732
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,390
Do you know Greg Nelson, who from
the Minnesota martial arts? Every,

733
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,870
he actually used to train with, uh,
some, some Pontalis camp. So yeah.

734
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:09,320
Greg's a old friend of mine. Really
good martial artist. So yeah,

735
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:14,060
he trained with a [inaudible], uh, den
monks ran, actually scrapped with Danny,

736
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,870
Danny, Bill and, and uh, Ramon
decker back in the day. So he,

737
00:43:17,871 --> 00:43:21,800
he's a class too. Wow.
Watching high level ties. Yeah.

738
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:25,310
This is a class that's an Olympic neath.
I miss the old stadium.

739
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,780
I was there in the 90s. Man. Somebody
good fights. I got to see. I'm blessed.

740
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,500
But uh, how long did you
go to Thailand for? Um,

741
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,990
I've been there like I'd
go three months at a time.

742
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,510
The best thing I ever did honestly is,
um,

743
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,180
I was able to bring some of the
top guys to come live with me.

744
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:48,110
I used to have four guys from
timeline living with me. And uh, it,

745
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:53,270
it was awesome because I was able to
plug in and extract all that information.

746
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,460
You know, it was fun. Um, might have
to fast forward a little till the,

747
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:02,060
you see the end. These guys are gone off
though. This is beautiful to watch. Yeah,

748
00:44:02,061 --> 00:44:03,740
it really good technique.
Actually.

749
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:08,720
Den also did some boxing for the Thai
amateur team to Eh, you know, just uh,

750
00:44:08,721 --> 00:44:12,500
actually the logo you see on the right
is Song Chai. If you're on Youtube,

751
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:15,020
go to song tries channel.
It's a killer.

752
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,430
That was the biggest promoter in Thailand.
He used to promote boxing Muay Thai.

753
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:23,810
He's the one who promoted decker. Rob,
our friend rob common. Just uh, yeah,

754
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:27,680
here we go. Here. Watch this doc bow,

755
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,460
but check it out in Thailand. The bet.
So much den monks in celebrating, he won.

756
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,900
He won because he fell out
of the ring. See, look at
that. They're jumping for joy.

757
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:37,734
They won the bet.

758
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,710
So that's when they switched the
rules a little bit in Thailand.

759
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:44,970
Guy got fucked up. He broke
his back. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

760
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:49,360
Check this out here. See I picked
picks it up. Plow, jump, boom.

761
00:44:49,361 --> 00:44:51,420
We've got fucked up though.
Yeah.

762
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,560
The guy who's doing the
plow got fucked up. Crazy.

763
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,940
I know that it became illegal because the
guy who we plowed didn't even get her.

764
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,120
There was a few other incidents
where they hit the ropes and bolts.

765
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:07,620
Would flip and yeah, that's the thing.
Timeline. Do you know I miss those days,

766
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:11,670
those rules because of
actually like the fights from,

767
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:14,850
they call the golden era before 99,
2000,

768
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:20,040
there was a better style of fighting.
Something may happen. The bedding change.

769
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,390
Too many stadiums.

770
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,320
Like everyone got into doing
premiere league betting on that.

771
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:28,950
Instead of going to the stadium, you
know, it's premiere league soccer.

772
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,120
They liked soccer more.

773
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:34,440
It really hurt the economy or more time
the economy went down and they can pay

774
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:37,310
the athletes as much as well.
Well now we'll knock.

775
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:39,900
I Kim fell out of the ring like that.
What happened?

776
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,970
He shattered his back when he came
back to fighting though. Really? Yeah.

777
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,780
He healed up and he returned.
He just broke a bone. Broken
bone. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

778
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:53,280
Probably a back rib
backbone. Yeah. Crazy. Right.

779
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:57,090
But it's crazy that that is the one that
made it illegal because the guy who is

780
00:45:57,091 --> 00:46:01,240
executing that technique is the one that
got hurt. Yeah. It's old school mean. Um,

781
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:02,820
but no nice thing.
And UFC,

782
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:07,620
we get to see that you gauge the cage is
much better because it stops guys from

783
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:10,890
going out. That was an issue in pride as
well that would fall through the ropes.

784
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,170
Guys would get caught up in
the ropes and techniques.

785
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:16,710
They couldn't defend themselves, you
know, problematic. No, it's show.

786
00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:19,010
I used to like there was a ring,
I think it was um,

787
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:23,040
storm San Mariah I think are
theory fighting from Brazil.

788
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:27,750
The att or a Btt verse and the verse,

789
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,780
the shoe box guys, is that when they
had the net at the bottom right? Yeah.

790
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,210
That was actually going out. Yeah. Those
were insane. Like if you're just in the,

791
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:40,620
you, you want some blood clause
and a soccer kicks and stomps.

792
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,160
Did you ever see Chuck Liddell
versus Palae? Yeah. Yeah.

793
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:45,830
That was back before
chuck fought in the UFC,

794
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,310
fought palae and in the real valley
Tudo days where there was no rules,

795
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:53,370
no gloves, no rules, no, no nothing.

796
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:56,040
They're beaten the fucking shit
out of each other and Paly,

797
00:46:56,041 --> 00:47:00,000
it was trapped in the net.
Like he was underneath the bottom rope,

798
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:03,060
like stuck in the net. Chuck's
beaten on them. Madness.

799
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,840
The speaking to old school.
I was in Cincinnati at the UFC.

800
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,190
I made a Sean Shelby and
Joe Shit civil laugh.

801
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:14,580
Why lead Ishmael walked by
and I seriously had to go,

802
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,440
you know what guys like I scares me.

803
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:20,910
Luckily I know him because our team's
part of the Carlson Gracie team. He's,

804
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:22,170
he's nice to me,
but he's,

805
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:26,060
that's one of the most ferocious like
dudes have ever seen choked hoists.

806
00:47:26,061 --> 00:47:30,300
Gracie unconscious on the beach in
Rio. They were telling me a story, uh,

807
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,500
some of the Carlson Gracie guys, how
down he has for Carlson Gracie, the team.

808
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:39,340
He was at a tournament in Brazil.
He won,

809
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:43,990
he got his elbow popped and um,
some,

810
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:48,610
uh, the, the loop delever guys
storm the tournament and like,

811
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,280
they're all challenged him
and while he jumped up,

812
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,100
he of course he's going to
lead the charge while he goes,

813
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:57,670
I'll take on every one of you efforts.
But he couldn't straighten his arm.

814
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,650
So it's fingers pointing that way.

815
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,340
It's like armors is dangling
there and he's still ready to go.

816
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,940
What a tough sob. His, you
know, he was tough as shit.

817
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:11,040
You remember those recordings of him
when he was mad at high and just telling

818
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:15,670
the story about high end Gracie, somebody
had a great video that they had online.

819
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:19,480
It was on the underground of him
explaining like the thing, you know,

820
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:24,630
he had the thing he's called Gauher Geez
chicken and he's doing with his accent

821
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:31,210
describing high end. It's
a character now. Now.

822
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:35,620
I mean luckily we both got
the know Carlson senior.

823
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,820
I was there at the end with Stephan.
You trained with them. I mean it's that,

824
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,540
that branch or the Gracie
family man. Real deal. I mean,

825
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:47,920
not that anyone else isn't.
I'm just saying what they
did to MMA. Yeah. Incredible.

826
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,830
I mean, Vito Belfort, Mario Sperry,

827
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:54,820
Marillo Bustamante the Noguera's thinking
about all the different people that

828
00:48:54,821 --> 00:48:59,080
came out of that crossbar. Andre
Punt and Eris Bonner, Stephan Bonner,

829
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:02,440
Miguel Pinero she went out to be
novel and Yao and level and yeah,

830
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:05,860
it was the biggest for all the lightweight
guys in Brazil. That's the biggest,

831
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:10,770
toughest team. And as well, our
friend Fabio Prado, who's with a, um,

832
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:15,880
a Alpha male and our coach gain of
underway to who lived with Carlson in

833
00:49:15,881 --> 00:49:20,350
Chicago. So like even it's part of the
roof of sport team. It's just school.

834
00:49:20,351 --> 00:49:24,550
Actually Carlson junior has been coming
up and helping out. It's fun to see him.

835
00:49:24,551 --> 00:49:29,050
He is a great guy and he's, he's, it's
cool man. He's a real MMA pioneer too.

836
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:33,970
If you go back and watch his
fights fighting. Oh yeah.
Yeah, me the organization.

837
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,820
It's been fun to, you know, again,

838
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:40,870
I really like making all these
new friends and everything I do,

839
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:42,640
whether it's Jiu Jitsu,
kickboxing,

840
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:47,290
now I've got a lot of fun wrestling
friends even, you know, I've, I mean,

841
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,860
being exposed to the asking bro,
aspirin brothers even.

842
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:54,490
I have a friend Eric Jergens who's a
really good Iowa wrestler that I met

843
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:59,260
through Pat Miletich and, and um, that's
the neat thing about combative sports.

844
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,370
They're the, the, the camaraderie.
It's, there's a special,

845
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:06,700
a fraternity that I want to
exchange for anything. Well,

846
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:10,570
I think it's also these folks,
first of all, they need each other.

847
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:14,560
Like you can't get good at MMA without
people to teach you and you need people

848
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:16,630
to train with and they appreciate that.

849
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,480
And they also appreciate that there's
very few people that understand them,

850
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,260
like other martial artists do or
other other fighters, you know,

851
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:27,590
when they're training the lifestyle, the,
the amount of effort that you to put in.

852
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,530
Very few people understand or appreciate
the dedication and commitment that's

853
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:36,350
required to be a professional
level MMA fighter. I mean,
you can't have, you can't,

854
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:39,830
there's no going out at night. There's
no life. You don't have any lie.

855
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:42,680
You might have a girlfriend and what do
you do? You, you might watch a movie,

856
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:46,150
get a little sex, and then pass out
before your training. And that's it, man.

857
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:49,880
You're not doing shit. You might get
to go on a vacation after your fight,

858
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,290
but guess what?
Your,

859
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,160
your amount of time you're
actually relaxing is so
small because if you did well

860
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:57,170
in that fight, they're already
talking about your next opponent.

861
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:59,150
So you start thinking
about the next fight.

862
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:02,300
And so you're on the beach somewhere and
all you thinking about his fucking head

863
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:06,410
kicks and tackles. And to me,
finding reminds me of apocalypse now.

864
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,610
We are in the bush. You think about being
an rnr, but when you're out in the rnr,

865
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:11,360
you just,

866
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,300
you want to get back in the Bush because
you don't want to get soft because

867
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:17,270
Charlie's gonna come get you. You
know what I mean? That's how I,

868
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:20,720
that's how I would be like, fuck,
I'm having a great time. Fuck off.

869
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:22,190
Fuck does not now another dude,

870
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:24,800
that's how it was for
Anthony won the world title.

871
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,200
It's like he was right back from the gym.

872
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:31,220
Cause he knows some dude wants that strap.
Like he wants to take what's his and,

873
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:36,140
and yeah, it's, it's a really unique
lifestyle. You know, it's very unique.

874
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:40,790
I mean,
it's not unlike any other movie musician,

875
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,610
comedian. You're only as good
as your last show. Honestly.

876
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:47,120
You're only as good as your last
performance when w the spotlights I knew.

877
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,680
But you got to love that.
You know the special people like Anthony,

878
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,280
Ben Askern, you know Alan
Belcher, they're the type of dude,

879
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:00,590
if it were the the final for the Ncaa
Championship or give me the ball.

880
00:52:00,591 --> 00:52:03,710
I want to shoot it. Take to be a
great fighter. You got to be that guy.

881
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:07,050
You're the quarterback is like, I'm going
to call the play coach. I got it right.

882
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:12,190
It takes that special person to be one
of the best and I love being around those

883
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:13,550
people because a,

884
00:52:13,551 --> 00:52:18,550
it's empowering to watch them be
that person. You know I I've love,

885
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:22,970
it was actually funny in Anthony's,
I'm fight with Serone,

886
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:28,080
I want them to stay righty and he
kind of stayed left. He kind of,

887
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,580
I was like the catcher and he was
a pitcher waved me off like no.

888
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:35,270
And I liked that though. I want my
guys to quarterback their own fights.

889
00:52:35,271 --> 00:52:37,820
I don't want,
if they have to count on everything,

890
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,100
I say they're not ready to be champion.

891
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:44,890
This whole Ben Astrin things are very
interesting subject because Ben asked her

892
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,230
and was a,
who was a great wrestler,

893
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:51,530
like elite amateur wrestler,

894
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:56,710
got into MMA and shows dominance in the
grappling that we have rarely ever seen

895
00:52:57,531 --> 00:52:58,280
before.

896
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,600
And for whatever reason he gets labeled
as being boring because of that.

897
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,980
But you see what he's been able to do
to guys like Lima, like these killers,

898
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,580
you know, he takes these guys
that normally, you know, they're,

899
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:15,140
they're in the involve these crazy wild
fights with people and he manhandled him.

900
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,870
He gets a hold of these motherfuckers
and he dragged him to the ground.

901
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:20,630
He beats the shit out of
him and for whatever reason,

902
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:24,920
because he's not finishing guys or
he's not finishing as many guys,

903
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,040
and it's just a constant

904
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,280
state of frustration for one guy to be
on the bottom and the other guy just

905
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:33,840
getting ragdoll by asking over and over
again, people label them in a bad way.

906
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:39,060
Bella Tor didn't even negotiate
two to reinstate his contract.

907
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:42,900
He was there fucking champion.
Now I had a real hard time with that.

908
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,260
I didn't understand the logic behind that.
Even slightly.

909
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:48,360
They let him go as their champion.

910
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,890
I thought that was completely
stupid and crazy too.

911
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,640
And then the UFC didn't even fucking
pick them up because there was some weird

912
00:53:56,641 --> 00:54:00,290
shit there with them not wanting
to pick up Bella tours guy and

913
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:04,590
well we did it with Hector
Lombard. It's frustrating. Um,

914
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:07,860
you know, it's really hard. I'm
really good friends with Ben.

915
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:12,180
He's doing great at one FC. They're
taking care of him. You know, it's just,

916
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,690
I want Ben to have a chance
to put his legacy out there.

917
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:20,400
I want to see him fight the best guys.
His fucking grappling is ridiculous.

918
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,030
He's more, he's moves are
very unique. It is. I mean,

919
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:27,800
I've seen him give high level black belts,
fits it.

920
00:54:27,801 --> 00:54:32,100
Definitely mean he's, he's
good and he just, you know,

921
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:36,540
submitted his last opponent mean
Ben is so good on the ground.

922
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:40,440
He makes it look easy that people
think he's not, you know, working hard.

923
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:44,760
But I think he has a new focus is who's
finished his last three opponents and

924
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:49,410
this law. He likes getting out of
there early now it's like, oh, okay,

925
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:50,880
don't get paid for overtime.
Yo.

926
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:55,860
A lot of people won't realize he's
third all time in the NCA at in pins.

927
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,730
Wow.

928
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:01,310
And he's one of two two
time hodge trophy winners.

929
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:05,730
The Heisman trophy or wrestling. So I
think him and it was a Cael Sanderson.

930
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:06,580
I'm very,

931
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,110
very impressed with that guys wrestling.

932
00:55:08,111 --> 00:55:11,680
And I was very upset that it didn't go
down, that he didn't fight in the UFC.

933
00:55:11,681 --> 00:55:12,280
I was,

934
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,550
when they were saying they were releasing
him from Beltre and he was talking to

935
00:55:15,551 --> 00:55:18,430
people in the UFC. I was very excited.
And there's a lot of people like, oh,

936
00:55:18,431 --> 00:55:20,050
he's boring. He's boy, I think.

937
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:24,820
I think Jane has said Ben Aspirin is
what ambien takes when it wants to go to

938
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:29,410
sleep or I don't, I don't
find them boring. I don't,

939
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:30,310
I mean it,
look,

940
00:55:30,311 --> 00:55:33,850
is it as exciting as watching Anderson
Silva knockout Stephan Bonner with that

941
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:38,290
knee to the body? No, no. It's not as
exciting, but is a huge element of MMA.

942
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:41,080
It's one of the biggest
elements of MMA is grappling.

943
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,950
Was Damien Maia versus Anderson Silva
tiding? No, no. Exactly. Not at all.

944
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:46,461
No.

945
00:55:46,461 --> 00:55:50,420
What I watched boxing matches were two
guys are supposed to beat each other up

946
00:55:50,421 --> 00:55:54,740
and it's a defensive stalemate and
that's just sports sometimes, you know,

947
00:55:54,741 --> 00:55:58,430
sometimes. Um, and this is going to be
the greatest super bowl and it's boring.

948
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,430
The last May where the fight was one of
the most exciting fights he's ever had

949
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,500
versus my Donna is because it came,

950
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:09,550
became a brawl that's not an Mayweather
fight. Mayweather fights are fights,

951
00:56:09,551 --> 00:56:11,890
three boxes,
guys faces off and then it goes away.

952
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,010
Like the Canelo Alvarez fight
wasn't particularly exciting.

953
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:18,460
No means you just sort of boxed him
outboxed him, moved around them.

954
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,720
Definitely. I mean, I, I,

955
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:24,190
I hope then in the next
year or so gets a chance

956
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:28,930
to show him he and I, I think the, the
welterweight division is kind of wild.

957
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:32,200
Placers. I mean, yeah, we got Johnny
Hendricks is a champ, but I mean,

958
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:37,010
Robbie Lawler lost a close fight
to him. Eh, there, there it's,

959
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:40,660
it's scary how close it is right now.
Yeah.

960
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,050
And Robbie Lawler just looked sensational,
knocking out Jake Ellenberger him.

961
00:56:44,051 --> 00:56:45,460
He looked like a fucking murderer.

962
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:48,130
Then Rory Macdonald just looked
outstanding and it's tiring.

963
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:52,750
You got Hector Lumbar, who's
fucking ridiculous. I mean,

964
00:56:52,751 --> 00:56:57,751
who is faster or more athletic than Hector
lumbar and he hits those fucking judo

965
00:56:58,241 --> 00:57:03,130
throws on high level guys to see Jake
shields go flying through the air on a hip

966
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:07,100
toss like that. It's like Jesus Christ. I,

967
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:09,820
I just know who I'm the happiest for.
Robbie.

968
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:13,390
I've known Robbie for a long time
through Pat Miletich and man,

969
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:17,200
that guys work so hard to
evolve, adapt, change and grow.

970
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,890
I don't care what people say.
You can teach an old dog new tricks.

971
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:23,110
It's all comes down to
attitude. I think, uh,

972
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:25,900
one of my favorite quotes by Zig Ziglar,

973
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:30,190
it's not your aptitude that
determines your altitude.

974
00:57:30,191 --> 00:57:33,850
It's your attitude. And he has the right
attitude. He made the changes. I mean,

975
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:38,500
he got way better at grappling. He's,
and he's so disciplined. I mean,

976
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,970
what a comeback story. The other comeback
story at one 72. How about Matt Brown?

977
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:47,590
Uncredible. Yeah. I mean, when people say
they can't get better, won't, don't want,

978
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,920
or sometimes when my guys get upset,
if they lose a fight,

979
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,830
then Matt Brown yourself,
you know,

980
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:57,100
pull yourself out of the be the
Phoenix that came out of the fire.

981
00:57:57,101 --> 00:57:59,310
Just work hard and at the right attitude.

982
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,740
Matt Brown was submitted by Seth
Bazinsky just two years ago. You know,

983
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,650
people don't forget,

984
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:07,300
they forget about some of the fights
that he's had where he lost the look.

985
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,090
If you are,
if you can still move correctly,

986
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:13,600
if you don't have a debilitating injury,
if you don't have cognitive problems,

987
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:15,880
you have been hitting the head too
many times. You can still learn.

988
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:17,320
You could still grow.
But some guys,

989
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:21,250
they do not do that because they're very
stubborn in their ways or they're stuck

990
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:22,790
on there.
They're on a path there.

991
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,320
They're stuck on that path and they
never develop. And it's unfortunate.

992
00:58:26,321 --> 00:58:30,490
It really is unfortunate because the
beautiful thing about MMA is the fact that

993
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:33,760
there's so many options.
And when you see a guy get to a high,

994
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:34,750
like a mighty mouse,

995
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:38,950
like a Demetrius Johnson who gets this
incredibly high level of aptitude and all

996
00:58:38,951 --> 00:58:41,410
these different areas, it's a
beautiful thing to watch, man.

997
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,240
So I'd love to his fight,
honestly,

998
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:48,241
I thought he did a great job of using
his Moy Thai style clinch to negate

999
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:51,970
wrestling used knees. Well, I mean it was,

1000
00:58:51,971 --> 00:58:55,720
he reminded me of a mini Anderson
Silva and that aspect using the clinch.

1001
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,650
I enjoy that type of fighting.
Uh,

1002
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,500
I think Matt Hume is an incredible
coach, one of the best. Yeah,

1003
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:06,670
I mean a great guy. And, and I, I
really enjoyed his performance. I mean,

1004
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,660
um, you know, sometimes people are
just into the heavyweights. I mean,

1005
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:14,920
I like watching smaller fighters fight
personally myself because there's much

1006
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:18,940
more going on. Not saying I don't like
heavy weights, but I mean, you know,

1007
00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:22,490
it just in general, you know,
it's small than that. Good.

1008
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:26,800
Well then what are you guys going to
think of 115 pound chicks white and, yeah,

1009
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:30,410
I mean, well that's coming and we
were just talking about that. Oh yeah,

1010
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:34,100
division is going to be the next
division in the UFC. Excuse me,

1011
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:39,030
the Straw Weight Division for
women for one 15. It's exciting.

1012
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:43,370
I'm going to be, uh, assisting Anthony
Pettis on the ultimate fighter.

1013
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:46,820
I'm only going 10 days and then
I come back a little later. Um,

1014
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,860
I want to Anthony to shine as a coach.

1015
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:52,490
People don't realize he's a really
good teacher coach and these really

1016
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:53,324
competitive,

1017
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:57,110
he'd knocked his baby daughter off the
chair to win if it were musical chairs.

1018
00:59:57,111 --> 01:00:01,760
I mean he, he is the type of
guy he likes to, you know,

1019
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:05,690
a couple of our, last summer we had
a pickup basketball game. Oh my God.

1020
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,450
It just turned into something
we'll funding thing on.

1021
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:13,850
He looked like Jordan going for the third
ring. It was just like every rebound,

1022
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:18,620
every, this kid wouldn't stop it. We
had so much fun. I mean, but you know,

1023
01:00:18,621 --> 01:00:21,560
when you do things like
that, casual games, you,

1024
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:26,030
you find out what certain guys are made
of, you find out how crazy they really,

1025
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:30,410
oh yeah. We, there was two, there was,
there was 10 alphas playing basketball.

1026
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:34,890
Not a smart move, but that should
probably be banned from the, the,

1027
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:38,750
the fight contracts. No basketball.
Yeah. Right. What is banned?

1028
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:40,130
Can they ride motorcycles?

1029
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,430
They're allowed to ride motorcycles
and things in our band. Right.

1030
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:48,380
I believe they can. I'm not sure. I don't
handle the management side of our stuff.

1031
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:53,180
I know that, uh, Anthony has a proud
owner of his Milwaukee Harley Davidson.

1032
01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:57,510
He won for his title. Does he ride a
little bit? Not Too much. So, yeah.

1033
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:02,150
I mean that's why I don't drive sports
cars or motorcycles cause I'm that idiot

1034
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:06,880
who wants to see how fast they can go
there. That's why, that's why I fight.

1035
01:01:06,881 --> 01:01:08,900
You know,
that's where I get my adrenaline out.

1036
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:12,320
I would worry more about the other
drivers. Yeah. With a motorcycle.

1037
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:13,760
My Dad's youngest brother,

1038
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:17,720
my uncle actually got
hit by a glass truck,

1039
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:19,400
um,

1040
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,400
motorcycle and he fell and didn't have
a helmet on cause and he's had many

1041
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:26,080
issues because of it.
But yeah.

1042
01:01:26,081 --> 01:01:29,900
And I mean unfortunately every year
or two I lose her friend in Wisconsin.

1043
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:33,740
It's just such a culture there. Live
to ride, ride to live, you know.

1044
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:35,330
But we have such potholes.

1045
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:40,450
And the other thing I've done I never
understood is jump on your bike and go to

1046
01:01:40,941 --> 01:01:44,930
a bar and start drinking. Yeah.
You know, that's uh, you know,

1047
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:49,650
people bar hop. What's crazy? The
bars of parking lots. Yeah. Yeah.

1048
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:51,990
Not a lot of drink and drive,

1049
01:01:51,991 --> 01:01:55,760
but it's a bunch of people drinking
and there's a bunch of cars. Hey, wait,

1050
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:58,850
there's less people in the bar then there,
where's the designated,

1051
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:03,290
wait a minute is not enough. Deadheaded
drivers. It's not possible. Now it's uh,

1052
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:08,410
you know, it's gold. Uh,
I, I, I can't handle the,

1053
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:13,070
the motorcycle culture. I love it, but
I'm the guy who will test my limits. Well,

1054
01:02:13,071 --> 01:02:16,400
I'd started trying to get
my motorcycle license.

1055
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:19,190
Me and a few friends that
were working on fear factor.

1056
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,340
Lot of the guys in production.

1057
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:24,660
We all signed up for motorcycle safety
classes. We started learning how to ride.

1058
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:26,700
We did all the thing.
I got a helmet.

1059
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:31,860
And then during the time where I was
learning three different people I knew,

1060
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,810
well one person saw,

1061
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:38,811
she saw a guy get hit by a motorcycle
and two friends got fucked up.

1062
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:44,040
Frank Mir got his leg, he got t boned
by a car. A guy ran a red light,

1063
01:02:44,041 --> 01:02:48,240
slammed into him, broke his leg, sent
him flying like 60 feet through the air.

1064
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:51,660
And if it wasn't for the fact
that he's this giant heavyweight,

1065
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:54,800
he probably would have been
paralyzed for life mean to it.

1066
01:02:54,801 --> 01:02:58,620
Amazing that he came back to fight
and, and, and become good again.

1067
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:03,720
Actually approved. Yeah. And then another
friend of mine, uh, Edson fell down.

1068
01:03:03,721 --> 01:03:07,070
It tore his shoulder apart.
He was going around a turn and to pikes,

1069
01:03:07,071 --> 01:03:10,320
slipped out from under him at boom,
hit his shoulder on the ground,

1070
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:11,970
mangled his shoulder.
Dude,

1071
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:16,740
crazy for my friend cognitive path who
used to live with me. I'm from Thailand.

1072
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:20,100
Deets down here in the states. Really
killer dude. And he was for time,

1073
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:21,750
Roger Number and she stadium champ.

1074
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,800
He went back home to Roy yet
northeast Thailand and his motorcycle.

1075
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,160
He had all souped up.
He got in a motorcycle accident,

1076
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,790
his ankle got bent back the other way.
And the accident,

1077
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:34,920
that was after his first title.

1078
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:39,930
He went on to win three more championships
and go outside Thailand and fight

1079
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:40,891
with that ankle.

1080
01:03:40,891 --> 01:03:44,400
He'd be like rib randomly holding pads
at the gym and you just fall down like

1081
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:49,020
Kong. What's the problem? Oh, jet mark.
My ankle like hurts bad. I'm like,

1082
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:52,530
it would just give out on him. Yeah,
man. I'm like, how the thought? Yeah.

1083
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:57,220
That's incredible. I know. I mean, it's
uh, you know, motorcycles or, you know,

1084
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:00,870
if you've ever been to timeline, you've
probably seen a family of five on one.

1085
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:05,490
It's crazy. It's like they can fit a
family of five on a little one 25. Well,

1086
01:04:05,491 --> 01:04:09,330
if everybody was riding motorcycles
like in Thailand back in with less cars,

1087
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,440
probably safer.

1088
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:15,220
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the traffic's so
bad. So they go in between and uh,

1089
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,410
you know, taglines crazy though.
It's a, it's a fun place,

1090
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:20,820
but a crazy place.
Yeah.

1091
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:24,910
Yeah. How did Thailand get so many
ladyboys? What happened there?

1092
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:29,560
I don't understand,
but it's the Thai culture is so,

1093
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,370
um,
tower.

1094
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:36,090
Yeah, like the Buddhist
religion. It's um, my pen lie,

1095
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:39,330
which means don't worry, it doesn't
matter culture. But yeah, I don't,

1096
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,590
it scares me because I used to train it
a state you're talking when I first went

1097
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:47,790
and you know, I'd go to the beach on the
weekend and you know, all these chicks,

1098
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:51,210
weird looking chicks, hey, 60
men, I'm like to my friend, man,

1099
01:04:51,211 --> 01:04:55,590
these chicks really dig us man. Hey
Yo, text week this guy in a walker,

1100
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:59,010
hey 60 man. I'm like, wait a minute.

1101
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:04,610
I think their whole Cursio but
point being then that you can spot

1102
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,170
them a mile away. Your Adam's apple. When
you said that the big Adam's apple boy,

1103
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:14,350
they spite them to Mike cause some of
them you can't spot a mile away. So very,

1104
01:05:14,351 --> 01:05:17,980
very, very feminine. Yes and no.
I mean they look like the other

1105
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,270
Thai women.
I mean,

1106
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:24,150
ah, I see. Say you can tell.
Oh at least, yeah, yeah,

1107
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,060
yeah. I mean, but it's
fascinating that this one culture,

1108
01:05:27,061 --> 01:05:31,080
it's just known for ladyboys. Yeah.
And that it's a normal part of, like,

1109
01:05:31,081 --> 01:05:33,660
I had a buddy who went over there
and was drinking Brody Stevens.

1110
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:38,400
Brody Stevens told a great story about
it and we determined that he was 84% gay

1111
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:43,210
sex. He started off at that
he was 10% gay and a we,

1112
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:45,390
by the end of the conversation
we've worked at that.

1113
01:05:45,391 --> 01:05:48,450
He was somewhere over 50
definitely over 50% gay,

1114
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:51,900
but he told the story about a
meeting ladyboys there and you know,

1115
01:05:51,901 --> 01:05:54,390
just having a good time and enjoying it.
It didn't feel,

1116
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:59,190
didn't feel abnormal because he was
there in a culture where it's normal and

1117
01:05:59,191 --> 01:06:01,440
it's accepted. There was all
these other people that, you know,

1118
01:06:01,441 --> 01:06:02,820
even guys that were like,
you know,

1119
01:06:02,821 --> 01:06:06,540
straight guys were hanging out with these
ladyboys because it was just how they

1120
01:06:06,541 --> 01:06:07,374
did it over there.

1121
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:13,590
Not me, not me. I just

1122
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:19,210
know what, I never really partied much in
Thailand because I was always training.

1123
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,760
One trip I've had little fun,

1124
01:06:21,761 --> 01:06:25,780
but I mean like it's just weird.

1125
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:29,380
The one night my wife went to Thailand
with me once we were on a took,

1126
01:06:29,381 --> 01:06:33,960
took late night in Bangkok crews and back
to our hotel after some fights. And uh,

1127
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:39,060
we were right up to the dude and we
totally see this guy mash and kissing with

1128
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:42,410
total. This, the Adam's apple.
Both my wife and I were like, oh,

1129
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:47,400
oh if the crying game going on, oh
maybe that's what he likes. Yeah.

1130
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:51,230
But hey whatever, whatever floats your
boat, man. Whatever floats your boat.

1131
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:54,620
Thailand's a a wild place and all
sorts of other ways too, right?

1132
01:06:54,621 --> 01:06:57,410
I mean it's like prostitution is rampant.

1133
01:06:57,411 --> 01:07:01,360
There's Moy Thai fights in bars.
It's just, it's a wild, wild place.

1134
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:06,690
Why this thing I saw in Thailand was
I'm going to the temple fights or like

1135
01:07:07,171 --> 01:07:10,800
church festivals on the weekend and they
line up all the kids and they put them

1136
01:07:10,801 --> 01:07:15,180
in a line and there's no scale.
They just used to you too. You too.

1137
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:19,500
And then their families like all cause
some go to camps and someone just trained

1138
01:07:19,501 --> 01:07:23,850
with their families and then they
all bet on their kids, man. Wow.

1139
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,840
And you see like kids
getting elbowed and lily

1140
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,230
and then own the music
speeds up in the little kid.

1141
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:34,640
He kicked the shorts are way too
big yanking him up. You know,

1142
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:39,200
it's just like, I consider myself
kind of a tough dude, but I,

1143
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:43,130
I don't like watching the little kids
scrap down with elbows and I'm like, Hey,

1144
01:07:43,131 --> 01:07:45,700
you know, I have a daughter and
everyone's like, cause she gonna fight.

1145
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,980
And I'm like, maybe, I don't know. I
mean like fighting isn't for everybody.

1146
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:54,300
You know what I mean? No one time
at one of the other camps I was at,

1147
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:59,070
this kid had just come from
way northeast Thailand and um,

1148
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,590
he just wasn't sleeping well at night.

1149
01:08:01,591 --> 01:08:04,740
He was used to eating different
and one of the trainers, you know,

1150
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:08,910
sometimes the trainers drank a lot cause
they get the shit kicked him up out of

1151
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:13,260
pads. They're all former fighters, you
know, like live at the gym with you.

1152
01:08:13,261 --> 01:08:16,040
And so they just,
they're little well

1153
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:20,530
being beat up and when they crack the
shit out of the kid to shut up, you know,

1154
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:25,250
like they just, you know, just basically
a little toughen up session at midnight.

1155
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:29,080
You know, it's just little things you
see you don't like. I love Thailand,

1156
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:33,170
but I don't think it's healthy to send
a kid away at nine years old to become a

1157
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:34,880
boxer. No. You know what I mean?

1158
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,220
Like some of the guys I
brought over from timeline,

1159
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:40,940
I had to teach them things about life
that they didn't learn when they lived at

1160
01:08:40,941 --> 01:08:44,720
the Moitai camp. You know, it's
not normal to go live in a,

1161
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,500
basically what a white
I camp is a modern day.

1162
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:51,920
Lewdness it's a gladiator school.
You know what I mean?

1163
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,120
I love more eye to eye in a lot of it not,

1164
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:57,800
and please don't make it seem like
I'm trying to put it down. It's just,

1165
01:08:57,801 --> 01:09:00,500
you have to understand what it is.
It's a third world country.

1166
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:03,840
It's not martial arts,
it's a boxing gym. It's,

1167
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:08,030
it's professional horse racing.
They're there to make money for the camp.

1168
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:13,031
50% of their earnings go to the camp and
then the rest of their money they try

1169
01:09:13,221 --> 01:09:17,390
and send back home to their family.
Something that folks don't realize too.

1170
01:09:17,391 --> 01:09:21,170
When you hear like bullet crop, a
little book I'll pour promote. Yeah,

1171
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,930
that's his name is one thing.

1172
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:26,810
The Gym name is the name that he takes on.

1173
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:32,090
That's not even his real name at all.
It is is he has a boxing name.

1174
01:09:32,091 --> 01:09:36,400
Wachau boycott means uh,
cows white and boy is lotus.

1175
01:09:36,401 --> 01:09:39,600
So it's the White Lotus. And
then poor promote is, uh,

1176
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,380
he's a student or promote,

1177
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:44,780
promote is the boss of the camp.

1178
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:47,960
So he has a real name and then
that's essentially his nickname.

1179
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:51,740
I forgot his last name starts with a B,

1180
01:09:51,741 --> 01:09:55,100
but it's real name is somebody
that's his passport name. Yeah.

1181
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:59,630
All the boxers get a different name.
You know the of your boxing name and,

1182
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,770
yeah. So it's the White Lotus. Yeah,
that's what his name means. Cool.

1183
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:08,420
His nickname actually is dom, which
means black cause he's so dark. Oh No,

1184
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:12,770
it's messed up in Thailand, dude.
Like I think they got good skin tone.

1185
01:10:12,771 --> 01:10:15,220
We're trying to get tanned going,
running with them all.

1186
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:18,230
You can tell all the boxers running.
They got hats on.

1187
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:22,310
They got long sleeve tee shirts and long
shorts on because they don't want to

1188
01:10:22,311 --> 01:10:27,170
get tan cause it's frowned upon to be dark
skinned in Thailand. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

1189
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:30,470
It's like if you're dark skinned, you're,
you, you, you're from the country.

1190
01:10:30,471 --> 01:10:33,770
You work in the fields, you know, that's
what's going on with the Philippines.

1191
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,060
Yeah.
That sucks man.

1192
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,650
They're using glutathione and
glutathione somehow or another. Uh,

1193
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:43,370
it's an antioxidant, but
somehow or another, I think
they inject it or something.

1194
01:10:43,371 --> 01:10:45,630
I don't know what they're doing,
but they're doing it to, uh, to,

1195
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:49,880
to lighten their skin color
and it's become a very common
treatment and hear you.

1196
01:10:49,881 --> 01:10:53,760
And I want to be tamed. I liked being,
I want my vitamin D. I want, you know,

1197
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,940
it's messed up, man. It's not
only that Steve Maxwell who, uh,

1198
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:02,690
has been on the podcast several times
told me that vitamin D levels actually

1199
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:05,060
when you have vitamin D from Sun,

1200
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:08,990
that it actually has an anabolic effect
on the body. It helps your body recover.

1201
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:11,300
It helps develop and build muscle.

1202
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:14,250
Like there's a lot of positive
aspects to having vitamin D.

1203
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,670
I've, I mean, the hardest thing about
where I live is a tough winters, you know,

1204
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:22,320
from being from the Boston area and the
last couple weeks I've had some pep in

1205
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:26,220
my step, man, I, you know, the
sun's out. I'm feeling better,

1206
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:30,210
I'm working out better. You know,
it's, I believe you. I mean,

1207
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:33,600
a trick that I do because I struggle
a little bit with seasonal depression,

1208
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:37,170
our whole Gmu been, there's painted
super yellow, it's in a basement.

1209
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,680
I do it the trick myself
psychologically and my students.

1210
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:43,350
So you can't tell how
dreary it is outside.

1211
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,180
And then another trick they say to
do in the winter is don't wear your

1212
01:11:48,181 --> 01:11:51,390
sunglasses out.
The best vitamin D comes to your pupil.

1213
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:55,530
So right away while you're outside
in the winter and it's sunny out,

1214
01:11:55,531 --> 01:11:58,230
what that vitamin D come
through your pupil. It's this,

1215
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:02,040
that's the only way because it's not
strong enough to touch your skin in the

1216
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,840
winter when you live in winter areas.
But yeah,

1217
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:08,400
I'm a firm believer in vitamin D Sun.
Um, I'm really into the elements of life.

1218
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:12,580
Water is so important.
Sun, the wind, you know,

1219
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,870
in the stars. So like it's very
revitalizing all those things.

1220
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:17,340
That's one of the stars.

1221
01:12:17,341 --> 01:12:20,960
Like a good starry night dude gives you
like a feeling like your body. Like wow.

1222
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:24,390
That's why I love my wife is from central
Wisconsin and I love going out into

1223
01:12:24,391 --> 01:12:28,890
the woods and just chill in and
he would go out and there's lakes.

1224
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:33,660
It's just so beautiful. That's, you know,
looking up the stars, fresh air. I mean,

1225
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:38,130
it's uh, it's so important to
connect with nature actually.

1226
01:12:38,131 --> 01:12:42,030
Like in Vegas, every sex,
how are you going to a party?
Go crazy. I'm like, no man,

1227
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,080
we're going to go hiking.

1228
01:12:43,081 --> 01:12:45,810
My wife and I are going to go
hiking every morning at 6:00 AM,

1229
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:48,620
we're gonna stand Milwaukee
time, you know? Well that's our,

1230
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:52,560
I like going out into the mountains, red
rock, go up the Charleston, you know,

1231
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:54,840
do that. I mean, you know how it is older,

1232
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:59,010
you get a been there done that bought
the tee shirt, you know, it's pretty old.

1233
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:01,260
Well, a lot of fighters have
a real problem with without,

1234
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:02,730
when they live in Vegas too.

1235
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:07,110
And the ones who tend to do best are the
ones who avoid this trip and do things

1236
01:13:07,111 --> 01:13:11,280
like a little like me, maybe do a
little jet ski, maybe go hiking,

1237
01:13:11,281 --> 01:13:15,870
maybe go fishing, do something where
you're getting out of the Vegas,

1238
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:19,100
Vegas and getting into the
Nevada. Yeah, for sure.

1239
01:13:19,101 --> 01:13:22,500
State I've been going to Vegas
and so I was 18 for fights.

1240
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:27,060
So am I.
The first fight I went to was at the,

1241
01:13:27,061 --> 01:13:31,900
at the sands. That's how old
I am. And, and I just, I'm,

1242
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:36,980
and even, it's weird. I, I
uh, when I trained in Vegas,

1243
01:13:36,981 --> 01:13:40,200
I used to train that master toddies and
he had all these really killer trainers

1244
01:13:40,201 --> 01:13:44,940
from Thailand and they would all laugh at
me. They're like, Duke, you're not like,

1245
01:13:44,941 --> 01:13:49,440
I, I be home on the weekend.
They're like, you're not going out.

1246
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:53,970
I'm like, no, I want to win. I
go run on Sunday. They're like,

1247
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,150
you're not going out. Like, I dunno,

1248
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:59,310
I has everyone else who's come here
before done that. They're like, yeah.

1249
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,800
So that's why they gave
me so much attention.

1250
01:14:01,801 --> 01:14:03,990
I was so disciplined that like for me,

1251
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:06,270
I know I'm not the most
gifted and talented guy,

1252
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:10,620
so I'm the person now I'm having the
time of my life. I, I have a ball.

1253
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,990
You know what? I try and tell all my
fighters, all you fighters, man, dude,

1254
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:18,010
like Joe and I were, we're in our forties
and we're having the time of our life.

1255
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:22,990
It don't like it. It's a number.
Doesn't change how you live. You know?

1256
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,540
I keep going after competition.
Yeah.

1257
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:30,040
I mean I have more fun now
doing everything than I
did when I was a fighter.

1258
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:34,480
I was pretty boring when I was a fighter,
you know? Like I said, I just hang out.

1259
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:38,710
I became a movie buff comedy
buff because I watched that.

1260
01:14:38,711 --> 01:14:43,360
That was my hobby, you know? But
Dude, you can't, you can always party.

1261
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,980
You can always chase girls. You can always
eat bad food. You can always do drugs.

1262
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:52,090
Whatever you want to do. After
fighting, you can do that,

1263
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:55,120
but you only have so many years.
You know what I mean? You have a,

1264
01:14:55,450 --> 01:15:00,280
you have a lifespan to be great and
that's, that's what I preach to my guys.

1265
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:04,150
Cement your legacy and then have some
fun and it's also important to take it

1266
01:15:04,151 --> 01:15:06,580
into perspective.
Like there's guys that are super talented,

1267
01:15:06,581 --> 01:15:09,910
they're supernaturally talented and it
doesn't take much and they can, you know,

1268
01:15:09,911 --> 01:15:13,510
there's guys who were champions are
notorious for not working out very hard,

1269
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:17,860
but you know what comes along like say
like guys who don't train in between

1270
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:21,130
fights, they just sorta hang out
somewhere. You know what comes along?

1271
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:25,690
Somebody who's exactly like
you but disciplined. Yeah,

1272
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,280
exactly.
And those guys are out.

1273
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:32,020
Those perfect storm athletes are out
there that are really physically talented,

1274
01:15:32,021 --> 01:15:33,910
really mentally talented,
very strong,

1275
01:15:33,911 --> 01:15:38,680
very creative and super disciplined
and hungrier. Man, you know,

1276
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:42,550
that's, to me the person who wants
it is who wins the fight. The one,

1277
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,280
the person who wants it,
it just doesn't start on fight night.

1278
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:46,510
It starts all year rum.

1279
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:51,760
The guy who trains all year round
wants it more than the guy who doesn't.

1280
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:52,920
Yeah. Yeah. You know,

1281
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:56,320
and there's so many examples now
that you could look to as far as,

1282
01:15:56,350 --> 01:16:00,430
one of the most important things about
martial artists is learning from past

1283
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:03,650
martial artists, learning from
their techniques, emulating
techniques as you were,

1284
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:07,060
you were talking about before with Belcher
and a lot of different fighters and

1285
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:10,780
this is like the greatest time
ever to have that opportunity.

1286
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:14,440
Like do you know what sugar ray
Robinson would have given to have,

1287
01:16:14,441 --> 01:16:18,520
be able to see a sugar ray Robinson on
video before him to be able to study

1288
01:16:18,521 --> 01:16:23,110
films? There's no, what did you see? He
saw some grainy Jack Johnson footage.

1289
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:27,700
Exactly know. That's Kinda like,
I would say that's the, you know,

1290
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,790
like in basketball, you know,
people who change the game.

1291
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,240
I would say it was first it was Bob Cousy,
then pistol Pete,

1292
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:38,470
doctor j Jordan and then maybe Lebron now.

1293
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:43,360
But like those game changing the athletes
and boxing, who would it have to be?

1294
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:47,770
Jack Johnson, first athletic
moving guy, sugar ray Robinson,

1295
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,390
who I still watch and study. That is the
blueprint of the greatest of all time.

1296
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:56,500
Muhammad Ali,
of course it's a ram dog man.

1297
01:16:56,501 --> 01:17:01,240
Duran Duran is like one of my favorites
because the youtube cause like my

1298
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:04,330
family, I remember we read that paper
view fights. My Dad has five brothers.

1299
01:17:04,331 --> 01:17:08,030
I got five brothers who'd be crazy.
Like everyone would be on one side of the,

1300
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,430
you know, Duran over
here, Leonard, you know,

1301
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,720
I got to meet Ray Leonard to my brother
and know him. He's a great guy. But I,

1302
01:17:14,721 --> 01:17:19,070
I didn't like Leonard.
I W I was a blue collar type guy.

1303
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:22,970
I was a Hagler and Duran guy
cause I was a hard worker.

1304
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:25,280
So I related to,
you know,

1305
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:29,240
Duran and Leonard wasn't a hard worker,

1306
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:32,970
but everybody had this opinion of him
as they'll be this glamorous. Sure.

1307
01:17:32,971 --> 01:17:35,930
Ready boy, you know,
showing up with, you know,

1308
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:39,090
like a beautiful girl and mink coat.
That's the,

1309
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,270
the idea that you thought of
when you thought of it. Leonard,

1310
01:17:41,271 --> 01:17:45,230
the golden boy from the
Olympics. Meanwhile, pretty
fucking hard work. Oh No,

1311
01:17:45,231 --> 01:17:46,700
it ray ray was,
man,

1312
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:51,080
I got to hang out with ray a couple
times and he's cool. Rarely cool.

1313
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:56,090
And He loves martial arts. You know, he,
you know who his idol is. Uh, Bruce Lee,

1314
01:17:56,091 --> 01:17:58,320
he came out, um, when I think the,

1315
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:03,050
it was either when he fought Donnie
little blond or when he fought Hearns the

1316
01:18:03,051 --> 01:18:07,250
second time it was cold fight and
Caesar's, he came out in the Kung Fu suit,

1317
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:12,650
not the yellow and black, but
the traditional black, you
know, style. Oh yeah, dude.

1318
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:17,780
He used to train a little bit June Rhee to
really, yeah. Interesting. Yeah. I mean,

1319
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:23,000
uh, knows it. Speaking of, um,
you've got Bruce man, you know,

1320
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:28,010
it's, people just don't
realize how awesome he was.

1321
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:32,420
Yeah. Just like member was the first
armored a movie. It was enter the Dragon.

1322
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:35,510
Right. And then that, then you have, um,

1323
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:41,210
a Kareem Abdul Jabbar and the head
arm triangle and game of death too.

1324
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:45,710
I think he did. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, just, you know,

1325
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,590
it just crazy. Just,
I'm huge, like kind of,

1326
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:56,450
I love the guys who kind of shake it up
because actually even one of my mentors

1327
01:18:56,451 --> 01:18:57,740
in Thailand,
crew get tongue.

1328
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:02,360
He had a different style of Moitai that
wasn't necessarily the same or the other

1329
01:19:02,361 --> 01:19:06,680
gym. I liked a lot jockey Jim, they're,
they're not the norm. And, and I,

1330
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:10,310
I like finding the innovators,
you know what I mean?

1331
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,250
It's fun cause th that's the,
you know,

1332
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,950
it's like what would we do without
Steve Jobs, you know? I mean what he,

1333
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:20,300
I want my goal,
like with what I'm trying to do.

1334
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:25,570
I want to be an apple type product that
changes people's lives with martial

1335
01:19:25,851 --> 01:19:29,900
arts, you know? And uh, I just,
every day I try and think of like,

1336
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:31,720
we were trained around,
kicked today.

1337
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:34,700
My probably show you something
a little different every time.

1338
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:39,080
I'm trying to like innovate.
Yeah. Even the simplest move,

1339
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:44,390
you know what I mean? Cause that's
time is what makes techniques happen.

1340
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,630
The faster you can splice the time that,
that,

1341
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:51,960
that technique locks on or Wayans is
how you win a fight. We're also the,

1342
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:55,490
the various aspects of the techniques
that allow you to avoid counters,

1343
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:59,170
sales to doing it one way. You
don't avoid the counter, you know,

1344
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:04,180
those all those little subtle aspects
of striking that are lost on some folks.

1345
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,010
Yeah. I think that's why
it's good. The watch like um,

1346
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:12,300
those, uh, the UFC shows on Fox where they
break down the fights after the fight.

1347
01:20:12,301 --> 01:20:15,360
Dominic Cruz is really good at that.
Really good at breaking down.

1348
01:20:15,361 --> 01:20:16,470
We're fighters made mistakes.

1349
01:20:16,471 --> 01:20:20,070
Like a good example is the Conley Rich
Franklin fight when you're only knock

1350
01:20:20,071 --> 01:20:21,600
Franklin out with a co with a punch.

1351
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,380
We caught Franklin straight
up coming straight out.

1352
01:20:25,381 --> 01:20:27,360
I'm not moving the head
off the center line.

1353
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:32,250
How many fighters do you see that
are really talented? Great fighters,

1354
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:36,240
but they don't get with a good camp.
They don't leave their comfort zone,

1355
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:39,960
their surroundings. They might start out
with some gym that has limited trainers,

1356
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:42,840
but they're talented themselves.
They get to a certain level,

1357
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:45,300
but then they can sort of
stagnate and they fucking,

1358
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:46,830
they get fucked because of it.
Really?

1359
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,550
Yeah. I mean, it's like
any other sport, you know,

1360
01:20:49,551 --> 01:20:51,740
you got to go to the right
college and basketball,

1361
01:20:51,741 --> 01:20:56,630
baseball to get selected to go to
the NBA, NFL major leagues. You know,

1362
01:20:56,990 --> 01:21:01,320
it's unfortunate. I know everyone has
their Cinderella story. I mean, I,

1363
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:04,760
one of my students is fighting
Saturday, he's from Marshalltown, Iowa.

1364
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:08,630
He moved to Milwaukee and his careers
blossom because of he's fighting for the

1365
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:12,440
world series of fighting title. Uh, the
featherweight Rick the gladiator, Glenn,

1366
01:21:12,441 --> 01:21:13,380
great kid, man. Atlanta,

1367
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:17,420
incredible winning streak and his
game has gone up x exponentially.

1368
01:21:17,421 --> 01:21:20,720
There's a nice fight to his
on an MMA junkie today. Um,

1369
01:21:20,721 --> 01:21:24,470
he knocked the guy out in the world.
Great Kid. And that's, it's hard.

1370
01:21:24,471 --> 01:21:28,130
You've got to leave home. Something's
got to be on TV. Yes. I believe NBC.

1371
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:32,480
And who is he finding?
Um, oh, Alexi, the hoods,

1372
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:36,290
the good Russian kid. I forgot how to
say his last night. I got damn good.

1373
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,260
Rough number. Risky is there.
They know how to fight, man.

1374
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:43,570
They are not regular
white people. No, no, no.

1375
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,990
Off. How many knees did he take from
mighty mouse? Oh, like a hundred,

1376
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:51,200
a hundred knees in the face now.
Crazy. That guy just ate him.

1377
01:21:51,201 --> 01:21:53,660
He ate all those knees.
Speaking of Russians, I like,

1378
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:58,940
we were talking about him earlier. Um, so
stoked. Um, about this tournament are 10,

1379
01:21:58,941 --> 01:22:02,460
11. Oh yeah, yeah. He's got
a, a cool style fighting.

1380
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:05,630
I'm not picking his style over anyone.
What I like about him,

1381
01:22:05,631 --> 01:22:10,040
he's a [inaudible] stylist, but he's
also good at boxing and, but no,

1382
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:15,041
it's funny you're going to
love her because you're a
social media guru is during

1383
01:22:15,201 --> 01:22:17,480
his fights.
He's tweeting during the fight.

1384
01:22:17,481 --> 01:22:21,770
He's got someone a and is his
Twitter feed. It's awesome.

1385
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:27,240
But the, there's a, he's
awesome though. He's a cool,

1386
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:30,980
he's going up against that Pereira
from Brazil who like this guy,

1387
01:22:30,981 --> 01:22:34,610
he trains in the mountains that I
think there's a cool video on youtube,

1388
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:36,830
maybe a Alex Perrera.

1389
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:41,980
He's a native Indian from Brazil and
he channels all I spell Perrera for g.

1390
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:47,960
E. R. R. I. E. R. A, I believe. Um,

1391
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:50,420
maybe had glory into that too.
But yeah,

1392
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,850
there's a cool video of him
training up in the mountains,

1393
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:55,400
but he's a former boxer
and he did take Wando.

1394
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,610
She's got a sweet turning
sidekick. Uh, yeah, he, he,

1395
01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:03,350
he was not the fan favor are the favorite
fighter to win the middleweight Turner.

1396
01:23:03,351 --> 01:23:07,960
But this dude's tough. He beat a lot
of good. But um, I like loving a lot,

1397
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,780
eh? Eh. Here, check it out. This is him.

1398
01:23:10,781 --> 01:23:13,090
He's getting ready for the eight
man tournament this weekend.

1399
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:14,020
Okay.

1400
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:14,853
Look at this.

1401
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:24,230
He's really in tune. He fight. Who was
he fought so far in glory? A fight.

1402
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:28,100
Tyron spa. No, he's awake.
Class lighter. But uh,

1403
01:23:28,101 --> 01:23:32,090
he beat a really good guy from
Mike's gym in the final, uh,

1404
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,740
oh. I know who he fought. He
fought no, in his last fight,

1405
01:23:36,741 --> 01:23:41,310
he knocked somebody out with a left
hook. Oh, I'm Jacoby. Yes. Yeah,

1406
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:44,060
yeah. He, yeah, he brings it, man.

1407
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:47,200
That was a nasty left talk to and
Jacoby's toughest shit, man. Yeah.

1408
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:51,880
And how about Melvin Manhoef is
going to be in this tournament today.

1409
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:56,570
That's another guy that scares
me. I'm like, Hey, Mike passenger,

1410
01:23:56,571 --> 01:24:01,220
can you put his collar? I'm
pleased there's a dark color.
The ring. Excuse me, Mike,

1411
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:04,790
can you take them back to the gym? You
know, he's walking around. I'm like,

1412
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:06,170
I think my goal over here,

1413
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:10,160
that is one of the wildest guys
that has ever fought in anything.

1414
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:14,540
Melvin Manhoef is a wild motherfucker.
Oh yeah. I mean, there's just,

1415
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:15,921
I've trained in,

1416
01:24:15,921 --> 01:24:20,600
in Amsterdam and there's
just a unique crate.

1417
01:24:20,601 --> 01:24:24,260
Yeah. There's just a unique
craziness. His walkout out,

1418
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:29,690
you got to get this real Couto his
walkout where Mike is this firing them up.

1419
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:34,310
They know what Mike says to God.
God Damn for him at work. Oh yeah.

1420
01:24:34,311 --> 01:24:39,100
Him and bought her Howery to
animals and uh, they got Saki too.

1421
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:43,730
Yeah, it's crazy. I'm having a
lot of fun with the glory Gig.

1422
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:44,900
Um,

1423
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:49,900
I'm real thankful to have the opportunity
to kind of expose people to just stand

1424
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:54,200
up. It's fun. I mean, you know,
coke ups finding this weekend,

1425
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:59,960
he's on the, he's on the prelims. We
also got a really good kid from Thailand.

1426
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:04,940
He's only 19 years old with
106 fights. Watts. Yeah.

1427
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:10,050
19 with 106 fights I was hanging
out with is just gentle as a lamb.

1428
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:15,920
Nice little kid. I mean, he's just that
little baby face killer. Jesus Christ.

1429
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:19,400
And when you say cro, cop's in the
prelims is the aired prelims. Yeah. Yeah.

1430
01:25:19,401 --> 01:25:24,200
It's on Spike TV free. So yeah,
that's our warm up to the paper view.

1431
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:29,120
Now, hey, I got to tell you,
normally these guys are kind
of reserved, but a Rico,

1432
01:25:29,121 --> 01:25:33,250
very human and Daniel Guid or
going at each other on Twitter. Um,

1433
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,500
they've been good.
I think Geeta has been calling a Rico.

1434
01:25:36,501 --> 01:25:38,780
They call him the prince a
kickbox and he's the princess.

1435
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:42,560
He's going to steal his
Tiara. And then, you know, uh,

1436
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,970
[inaudible] has been going off about, he
says he's the number one of, you know,

1437
01:25:46,971 --> 01:25:50,330
in the rankings. He's like, well, you
know, you're the number one shit talker.

1438
01:25:50,331 --> 01:25:52,340
And I mean, they, the bolt of them today.

1439
01:25:52,341 --> 01:25:56,780
I've never seen European
guys this animated. I mean,
they're there. They fought.

1440
01:25:57,050 --> 01:26:00,650
Yes. And very controversial
fight, right? The first one,

1441
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:02,780
Rico won the tournament.

1442
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,890
There's that kind of controversial
knockdown with a Saki,

1443
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:12,130
which he pushed the RAF and he didn't
get cut from a glory for that Saki pushed

1444
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:15,770
the raft down. Right. Yeah. We'll,
we'll talk about that subject later.

1445
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:20,420
But now that,
then he beat a keyed in a close decision.

1446
01:26:20,421 --> 01:26:25,080
Geeta thinks he won. Geat has come back
and knocked out two big wins off. Yeah,

1447
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:30,260
he looked really good and now,
you know, very moving bead arts.

1448
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:33,730
He just had his first pro boxing
fight though. Very haven. Teddy Riley.

1449
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:37,310
He's been training with Tyson
fury and really working on it.

1450
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:41,160
He fought boxing really recently.
It has seven weeks ago.

1451
01:26:41,161 --> 01:26:46,150
I was a lot of guys and Gloria
are moonlighting. Nikki,

1452
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:47,300
uh,
Holtz can,

1453
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:51,320
he's been pro boxing marked
a bone to funding a bazooka.

1454
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:55,720
Joe Van Hel to Leni Veltin Leni is
fun to watch and fun to watch. Yeah.

1455
01:26:55,850 --> 01:27:00,290
Raymond Daniels was a awesome, yeah,
fine. I, I'm big fan of Raymond,

1456
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:04,290
but he did exactly what
you're supposed to do to do.

1457
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:08,510
Can we get that fight up there? Raymond
Daniels and Bazooka Joe and debunk.

1458
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:11,930
Is that for the title? Yeah,
it's for the title. Yeah,

1459
01:27:11,931 --> 01:27:16,730
the bone just beat a carpet care
patching in Denver. Yeah, very technical.

1460
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:19,940
I mean, uh, carpets are
really super smart fighter.

1461
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,690
Both technical and Karpov was really
coming on those last rounds too,

1462
01:27:23,691 --> 01:27:27,860
which is interesting. Um, no, like
the bone, he throws some jump kicks.

1463
01:27:27,861 --> 01:27:32,450
He does the jump, scissor kick. A
lot of cool moves, jump fly knee.

1464
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:35,650
But you know, Bazooka Joe,
he reminded me if I did do,

1465
01:27:35,651 --> 01:27:37,430
just describe who Bazooka Joe is.

1466
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:42,700
He's the arterial Gaudy of a
kickbox Canadian Italian scrapper.

1467
01:27:43,521 --> 01:27:47,870
But here you can see it stayed
on the legs. Nicely dissected.

1468
01:27:47,871 --> 01:27:51,600
But when after the high kick, that's
all she wrote. Mama Mia, you know,

1469
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,510
it was beautiful. Yeah.
That was beautiful.

1470
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:58,150
He's only got 11 pro fights and he
went toe to toe with Nikki Holt's can,

1471
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:02,990
you know? Yeah. And was hanging in there
until the end. Yeah. And the final round.

1472
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:06,470
But that was also a fight where he
fought that fight before. Exactly.

1473
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:07,610
I mean I think,

1474
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,620
I think Bazooka Joe was going to be
tough to beat in the single fight format.

1475
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:14,990
I got to tell you,
I don't particularly like the,

1476
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:19,730
the tournament format because I think
it's unfair if a guy has one fight early

1477
01:28:19,731 --> 01:28:22,100
and he knocks the guy out in the first
round where's his opponent might have to

1478
01:28:22,101 --> 01:28:25,130
go a fourth round because the
three rounds of gone to a draw.

1479
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:28,040
I think that's crazy to have
those two guys fight afterwards.

1480
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:32,840
I know it's kind of exciting, but I don't
think it's fair to the athletes. I, I,

1481
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:36,200
I've loved that Gloria has done
our five round title fights.

1482
01:28:36,201 --> 01:28:40,850
It's just been magnificent because we
see the art of fighting. We really do.

1483
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:42,830
Um,
the tournaments are,

1484
01:28:42,831 --> 01:28:47,831
are there a cool spectacle for the fans
who want to see the blood and Gore,

1485
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,610
but the technique and the art of strategy,

1486
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:56,210
I think we see that in a title
fight. Yeah, no doubt. No doubt.

1487
01:28:56,211 --> 01:28:59,160
There's been some gray great
fights too in the last, uh,

1488
01:28:59,161 --> 01:29:03,600
the lightweight division fight
that last fight with um, uh, the,

1489
01:29:03,601 --> 01:29:07,860
the uh, Kachin. Oh yeah, yeah man.

1490
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:12,510
Cause Rusty was coming off those two
big wins over Giorgio Oprah Petrosyan,

1491
01:29:12,511 --> 01:29:16,500
which is a huge upset. Oh yeah. Petrosian
who is like one of the greatest ever.

1492
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:18,870
Yeah, definitely. He was up to that point,

1493
01:29:18,871 --> 01:29:23,370
considered the Mayweather of our
sport and uh, you know the glory.

1494
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:25,990
That's the crazy thing.
The parity. That's what,

1495
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,710
what I love about the kickboxing.

1496
01:29:28,711 --> 01:29:32,910
The fights are so evenly matched and
this is Rusty's first fight back. Yes.

1497
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:35,650
Glory card this weekend he's fighting
in the tournament, right? Yeah,

1498
01:29:35,651 --> 01:29:40,050
he's actually fighting Chi Hollenbeck.
Um, the spike TV broadcast too.

1499
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:44,610
So that's another tasty fight for fans.
Not a tournament fight. Not to fight on,

1500
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:47,380
on Spike TV.
There's going to be a four man,

1501
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:52,020
a featherweight tournament and that,
that's going to be a really good,

1502
01:29:52,021 --> 01:29:56,070
you've got a Yo yo come
poon sit chai from Thailand,

1503
01:29:56,071 --> 01:29:59,430
the 19 year old with 106
fights. Uh, Gabriel Varga,

1504
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:03,510
who's a really lifelong martial artists.
I like this kid style a lot.

1505
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:07,530
He's good at kickboxing, incorporate
spin kicks, he can punch.

1506
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:10,980
He has a fun style. He's
a lot of fun to watch. Uh,

1507
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:15,600
and you got Marcus vis a
vi Venetia's excuse me,

1508
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:19,590
from Brazil as well.
So it's going to be a tasty tournament.

1509
01:30:19,591 --> 01:30:23,750
So that's the tournament.
And then receives fighting
Hollenback a single fight.

1510
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:27,060
And then cro cop is
fighting Terrelle Miller.

1511
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,040
She has a win over Pat Barry in the
world combat league and he fought

1512
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:38,430
cro cop, I believe in the k one last
year. The that whatever's left the K one.

1513
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:42,810
Um, but everyone thought
GRL one, so I didn't,

1514
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:47,040
I watched the fight. I, I could have
saw it that way too. It was in Croatia.

1515
01:30:47,370 --> 01:30:52,230
So I was going to cro cop's making
this resurgence as a kickboxer. Yeah,

1516
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:55,770
it was pretty cool atmosphere in
Zagreb when he fought. I mean,

1517
01:30:55,771 --> 01:30:58,950
I thought he'd beat Remi.
I did too. Yeah. Rentable.

1518
01:30:58,951 --> 01:31:02,610
And Jessica was another great fighter
who's been around the block a long time.

1519
01:31:02,611 --> 01:31:07,290
He's been actually, uh, no, it's really
cool. Is on the broadcast isn't, yeah,

1520
01:31:07,291 --> 01:31:11,400
they're bringing in Stephen
Quatros a microscope vow and remi,

1521
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:13,500
we're going to have some
extra kind of like you,

1522
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:17,670
you're talking about the UFC is doing the
extra analyst and breaking things down.

1523
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:20,550
So we're going to have a fun and it
will be run crock and I in the booth,

1524
01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:23,840
Luke Thomas, we're going to have a
lot of fun with this broadcast. Uh,

1525
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:27,450
I'm having a ball doing this cause I,
what I like doing,

1526
01:31:27,451 --> 01:31:32,190
like what you do at the UFC is let
people behind the curtain, you know,

1527
01:31:32,191 --> 01:31:35,400
it's different.
People kind of understand punching boxing.

1528
01:31:35,401 --> 01:31:37,920
That's a jab across a hook.
It's martial arts.

1529
01:31:37,921 --> 01:31:41,520
There's a little bit more detailed to it,
not taken away from boxing.

1530
01:31:41,690 --> 01:31:46,170
And we need to have that time and room
to explain everything because there's a

1531
01:31:46,171 --> 01:31:47,970
little bit more going on with the kicks,

1532
01:31:47,971 --> 01:31:52,050
the knees and some of the sweeps trips
and obviously in Jujitsu and wrestling,

1533
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:55,380
a lot of minute details that
make a big difference. Yeah.

1534
01:31:55,381 --> 01:31:59,650
And there's also people can relate to what
it feels like to get punched. I don't,

1535
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:02,860
there's like we're saying about leg
kicks things people don't understand.

1536
01:32:02,861 --> 01:32:07,420
They just don't, they people who judge
fights unfortunately don't understand.

1537
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:10,600
We have a real problem with
Matt. I remember the first,
uh, I was at that fight.

1538
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:14,520
UFC One oh four.
A shogun versa.

1539
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:17,100
Machida owed him a shitty yeah.

1540
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:21,070
And he kicked the shit out of his legs
and he didn't win the fight. And someone,

1541
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:22,990
one of the judges actually said leg kicks,

1542
01:32:22,991 --> 01:32:26,140
don't finish fights like the
fuck are you talking about?

1543
01:32:26,141 --> 01:32:27,760
Are you just ignorant to history?

1544
01:32:27,761 --> 01:32:32,761
Because I'm both times I broke into guys
likes with leg kicks size on the femur.

1545
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:38,890
I, I fought Mitchell Holla
in 1996 and Australia,

1546
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:42,670
I think it was kicking heart.
He broke his, the Tibia,

1547
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:47,500
he stopped on the stool because it
was blocked wrong. So broke that.

1548
01:32:47,501 --> 01:32:48,490
And then Pat Smith,

1549
01:32:48,491 --> 01:32:52,720
I kicked him on the back leg and I
cracked the bone right above raped by the

1550
01:32:52,721 --> 01:32:56,730
knee joint there. So
yeah, it's uh, I like,

1551
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,630
I liked the like kick a little bit.
Leggings are awesome. I'm sorry. I mean,

1552
01:33:01,631 --> 01:33:05,200
it's a great feeling to know that you can
do that to someone. There's something,

1553
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:10,180
I don't know. I, I, I've always told
my guys a, this isn't a some mad,

1554
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:14,640
but as I've gotten older,
I've probably changed my opinion on it.

1555
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:15,870
I used to have a quote,
uh,

1556
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:20,440
knocking someone out with a head kick
is better than sex. You know, I love,

1557
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:23,110
there's nothing better.
It's my favorite thing to do.

1558
01:33:23,111 --> 01:33:27,220
That's my favorite coup to
ground, to finish a fight
and striking as a head. Yeah.

1559
01:33:27,221 --> 01:33:31,600
The head kick. That's why I really push
it with all my guys. It's weird too,

1560
01:33:31,601 --> 01:33:34,030
when you connect to someone's had a
lot of times you don't even feel it.

1561
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:37,930
It feels that it goes right through them.
Yeah. Especially the neck kick. I mean,

1562
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:41,500
that to me is my,
my favorite technique.

1563
01:33:41,501 --> 01:33:44,110
Air Coke's gotten a bonus with it and WC,

1564
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:49,440
Anthony's got a bonus WC knockout and
UFC and when got it against a Jorge

1565
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:53,380
Santiago, um, yeah, it's, it's,

1566
01:33:53,381 --> 01:33:57,760
you see Sir Little Sergio's hunting
fork constantly. We like to kick that.

1567
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:59,160
It's this cool man.
It's,

1568
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:04,240
it's yielding a special power that most
people don't have. Dude. Like, Whoa,

1569
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,940
he's trending. Knock me out with
a head kick. I love it. You know,

1570
01:34:06,941 --> 01:34:10,660
it's an intimidation factor. It's
like Peter Arts, he's same age as me.

1571
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:15,661
That's one bad motor scooter and he's
still winging head kicks in his fights,

1572
01:34:15,881 --> 01:34:18,820
man. Yeah, he's still at it,
man. Hundred percent. Yeah.

1573
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:23,630
Peter is something else to me in his last
fight. No, he said he was retiring. Yeah,

1574
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:27,430
he just fought in Dubai, so he said he
was retiring and he just fought again.

1575
01:34:27,431 --> 01:34:31,030
Anyway, man, that's just never
going to retire. I love Peter.

1576
01:34:31,031 --> 01:34:34,750
He sees a man like he, he, uh,

1577
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:38,290
he just exemplifies what's
special about our sport. I mean,

1578
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:42,610
got like Rico Verhoeven grew up in
wanting to be him and now here he is.

1579
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:46,180
And I mean, Peter's
just, he's funny, joking,

1580
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:48,280
laughing and his,

1581
01:34:48,281 --> 01:34:52,900
he been stopped something like
14 or 15 times. Yeah, I think so.

1582
01:34:52,901 --> 01:34:57,480
I mean he's, how's that possible? But
he's got over a hundred. Some fights. Is,

1583
01:34:57,481 --> 01:34:58,280
is it possible

1584
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:02,570
that you can kick code 14
times and you're still right?

1585
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:05,830
You're still out there and I hope
he is. I don't know if he is. Yeah,

1586
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:08,930
he talked to him a little
bit. What's it like? Oh,

1587
01:35:08,931 --> 01:35:11,900
he's got a thick Dutch accent these days,

1588
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:16,880
so it's hard to tell if he slurring
his words. That's a weird moment,

1589
01:35:16,881 --> 01:35:17,211
isn't it?

1590
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:20,000
When you're talking to a fighter and you
know for sure somethings going on that

1591
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:23,420
didn't used to be going on.
You know,

1592
01:35:23,421 --> 01:35:27,050
I've met a few kickboxers that or we'll
punch drunk and I know boxers from back

1593
01:35:27,051 --> 01:35:30,210
home. I mean one of my training
partners, years ago, Chiro,

1594
01:35:30,211 --> 01:35:33,710
Mcclellan almost died in a boxing match.
That was one of your training partners.

1595
01:35:34,330 --> 01:35:38,930
He's a mark. Yeah. Yeah. That
was scary, man. That's scary.

1596
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:41,540
That scared a lot of good
differences or phones.

1597
01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:44,630
Sometimes boxing
commentators and you guys,

1598
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:48,920
I feel we're empathetic.
You're empathetic to people's problems.

1599
01:35:48,921 --> 01:35:53,590
I remember like doctor [inaudible]
Pacheco was calling the fight. Like,

1600
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:58,190
I can't believe this guy is quitting.
You could see like he was blinking.

1601
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,970
There's something seriously wrong. I, I,

1602
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:04,820
I'd never call fight again if I call the
guy quitter and he slumped over in the

1603
01:36:04,821 --> 01:36:09,530
corner and Freddie Pachecos yeah,
he was old school.

1604
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:11,360
You know,
a lot of those old school guys,

1605
01:36:11,361 --> 01:36:15,950
they had that sort of an attitude
about about, okay, yeah, go, go,

1606
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:20,180
go get punched yourself. You
know what I mean? You've,

1607
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:22,910
you've gone in there getting punched.
You gotten so made it wrestled.

1608
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:27,500
You'd know what it feels
like. You know me too. And uh,

1609
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:29,960
now there's nothing worse than
the guy who's never done it.

1610
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:31,490
Who's judging the guy who does it?

1611
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:34,550
I mean it is horrible and
it's very unfortunate.

1612
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:38,120
It's unfortunate that a lot of those
guys get into that position whether the

1613
01:36:38,121 --> 01:36:39,620
reporters or what have you.

1614
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:42,200
And they start talking shit about
fighters after their performance,

1615
01:36:42,201 --> 01:36:45,050
questioning their heart
and courage and like, look,

1616
01:36:45,051 --> 01:36:47,330
you can say that a guy didn't
have a good performance.

1617
01:36:47,331 --> 01:36:49,220
You can give an assessment
of their performance.

1618
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:53,820
When you start making
character assessments and
character judgments, that site,

1619
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:58,310
you're stepping way out of line. Do
you ever have bad days at work, Jamie?

1620
01:36:59,330 --> 01:37:03,020
Sometimes you have bad day or off.
Well guess what? Fighters fight two,

1621
01:37:03,021 --> 01:37:04,160
three times of the year.

1622
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:08,150
Unfortunately their chance to have in
bad days are higher than a guy who works,

1623
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:12,740
you know, many days a week. You know
what I mean? It sucks. I mean, you just,

1624
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:15,290
I am not making excuses,

1625
01:37:15,291 --> 01:37:20,000
but the Anthony Pettis that fought Guido
was like the worst. Anthony Pettis,

1626
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:23,600
every was flat in the locker and he just
wasn't feeling good and know what it

1627
01:37:23,601 --> 01:37:26,960
was. The best thing for him
losing is the best medicine.

1628
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:31,160
If you use it as a medicine to make you
better, but people have bad days, man.

1629
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:32,810
It's just, it's life. I mean,

1630
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:37,220
it sucks when you have a big moment in
your life and you just can't show up.

1631
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:42,360
But what Anthony has a piece of crap,
a pussy, you know, look, you know,

1632
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:47,270
I mean I overrated. Yeah.
You know that Duran,

1633
01:37:47,271 --> 01:37:51,280
he's a wimp. No mohs. You know, like
that fucked him up for a long time.

1634
01:37:51,281 --> 01:37:53,840
Know that fucked up
public perception of them.

1635
01:37:53,841 --> 01:37:56,220
That fucked him up personally
for a long time. Why

1636
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:59,160
is it, it's okay. In
our sport, we can tap,

1637
01:37:59,161 --> 01:38:01,920
which is humane and smart and MMA.

1638
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:07,280
But if you know you're hurt like my
flour but not in the Roberto Duran round.

1639
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:11,730
That was pretty shameful. Yeah. But the
no mas fight me. He's like, that's it.

1640
01:38:11,731 --> 01:38:15,270
I'm done. I'm done. He was
fine and he wasn't even trying
to fight. Yeah. It just,

1641
01:38:15,271 --> 01:38:18,570
I mean he knew it was getting smashed
though, but he wasn't getting smashed.

1642
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:23,900
Getting out box. My friend Nathan
Corbett, it's great duties here at La.

1643
01:38:23,901 --> 01:38:28,460
A training that black house that was he
real, hey, so you're a busy man. So, um,

1644
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:32,730
I think he's going to start helping,
uh, teach striking here in la. Dude.

1645
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:36,470
So if you're in the La area, look up
my man Nathan corporate, Gray, Gray.

1646
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:40,380
But did you see him when he got smashed?
He knew his ear was done.

1647
01:38:40,610 --> 01:38:44,800
I mean he didn't want to, you know,
he took by tyrants bong and spawn,

1648
01:38:44,810 --> 01:38:46,990
hit him with this left hook
and or go Comstock. Yeah,

1649
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:50,370
hit him with this left Hook and blood
started pouring out of it and he was just

1650
01:38:50,371 --> 01:38:53,640
like touching his ears. Like this
is over. I mean that's the thing.

1651
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:57,420
Do want guys to go out on their shield
or they didn't want to be intelligent.

1652
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,330
I mean, um, that was
intelligent. It's also a guy,

1653
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:04,930
Nathan Corbett has fought so many
fucking times and you saw the replay when

1654
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:09,090
[inaudible] hit him. It was just a
perfect left hook. His ear was fucked up,

1655
01:39:09,091 --> 01:39:13,350
rattled. It starts pouring out
of it when your ear jumps popped.

1656
01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:16,530
But the fight is basically, that
means you could do it, you know,

1657
01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:20,040
all these guys I respect win,
lose or draw.

1658
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:24,420
I mean that's the hardest thing about
going to the UFC or I have personal

1659
01:39:24,421 --> 01:39:27,990
relationships. A lot of guys, there's
not a lot of people, I mean in,

1660
01:39:27,991 --> 01:39:31,470
in professional martial arts that
are bad guys are just not like,

1661
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:36,030
I got like a high, you lost,
you know, I just don't, you
meet every guy and you see,

1662
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:38,910
you know,
like that ABC wild world of sports,

1663
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:43,620
the thrill of victory and the
agony of defeat. It's just
so you see that. It just,

1664
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:49,620
it's so hard to see the nicest guys get
there. That's the weak side of what I do.

1665
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,420
You see? You know, cause that's what
this is, you're fighting me to the crush,

1666
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:56,130
my dream to build yours.

1667
01:39:56,220 --> 01:40:01,110
It's so like it's old school coliseum,
you know.

1668
01:40:01,111 --> 01:40:03,230
I mean,
you know some crazy yeah.

1669
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:07,080
For guys to transition out of that to
go to the next phase of their life. Man,

1670
01:40:07,170 --> 01:40:11,190
I get fight offers all the
time I missed. Oh yeah, I love,

1671
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:13,770
I mean it was the last time you fight.
What year was it?

1672
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:18,460
A 2007 I think. 2008 it
says, what would you,

1673
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:23,140
where'd you fight in 2008? Uh,
Canada. Yeah, I I love, uh,

1674
01:40:24,230 --> 01:40:25,440
I love it.
But you know,

1675
01:40:25,441 --> 01:40:29,700
you gotta you gotta do the math is the
fighting part of my past or my future.

1676
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:31,970
So no, what I do, I go
a couple of weeks ago,

1677
01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:35,100
anything was boxing in the gym I saw
on Saturday. I'm like, oh screw it,

1678
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:38,110
I'll just spar three rounds with him.
So that's,

1679
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:41,880
that's my thrill now I go on spar. We had
a pretty good heated session, you know,

1680
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,540
it was fun. Not like we go hard cause
I'm way bigger than him. But we work,

1681
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:48,390
we have a good time. He had
fun. I had fun. But you know,

1682
01:40:48,391 --> 01:40:51,140
it's a quick reminder like that, man.
That's one little bad mother fucker.

1683
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:54,340
I don't think I want to him or her again.
And that was fun,

1684
01:40:54,341 --> 01:40:58,510
but that was practice not, I'm going
to go back to doing what I was doing.

1685
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:01,860
Actually. I do some Jujitsu tournaments
when I can, you know, I want to,

1686
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:04,840
I won the Arnold and I won a,
the grapplers quest.

1687
01:41:04,841 --> 01:41:07,000
That was when I was a white belt.
You got my blue belt.

1688
01:41:07,001 --> 01:41:11,260
Now I'm just looking for a pocket of time.
I can get serious. Cause I, you know,

1689
01:41:11,261 --> 01:41:15,760
our Jujitsu team's grown tremendously
under my friend and brother Dan have

1690
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:17,560
underway.
Like we,

1691
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:21,730
we had two weeks ago we had 14
fights at Rufus Sport and MMA.

1692
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:26,540
13 one nine of them were on the mat. Like
that's not a Rufus sports dance. Right.

1693
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:31,100
I've been really pushing all my
guys to be dangerous everywhere. We,

1694
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:35,220
a lot of my guys are going to
Ibj JF tournaments, you know,

1695
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:39,490
big Nagios grapplers quest winning.
Like I'm really,

1696
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:43,120
if you choose to be an MMA fighter
than really be an MMA fighter.

1697
01:41:43,150 --> 01:41:46,190
Let me ask you this. So if you're training
the Anthony Pettis world champion,

1698
01:41:46,191 --> 01:41:49,480
say if you're training him for his title
defense, uh, against Gilbert Melendez,

1699
01:41:49,481 --> 01:41:51,520
which is going to be a great fight.
I can't wait for that fight too.

1700
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,370
Amazing fighters.
When you train him,

1701
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:58,570
would you schedule his entire training
routine? Do you, do you set a schedule?

1702
01:41:58,571 --> 01:42:01,420
Like in the morning,
you're going to do this in the afternoon,

1703
01:42:01,421 --> 01:42:02,260
you're going to do that.

1704
01:42:02,261 --> 01:42:06,190
I want you to do five rounds on Tuesday
and then another three rounds on

1705
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:10,260
Wednesdays. I'll give
you his schedule. Um,

1706
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:14,770
we have a really good strength and
conditioning team. The guy who the,

1707
01:42:14,771 --> 01:42:19,540
who trains Jj watt from that.
Can we bring that up? Jj Watt?

1708
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:23,170
Uh, do a box jump. Um,

1709
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:24,880
there's either box jump.

1710
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:27,640
He's one of the best athletes
in and it fell and it's not,

1711
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:30,040
he's from the Milwaukee or
it's not by chance though.

1712
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:34,200
He's been at our strength and conditioning
center, annex level, Brad Arnett,

1713
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:37,900
who used to be the head
strength and conditioning coach
at Arizona and Minnesota.

1714
01:42:37,901 --> 01:42:42,520
Incredible. A lot of NFL or NBA guys
watch this, does it do to our 90 pounds?

1715
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:46,330
59 and a half inches. Yup. That is insane.

1716
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:50,350
That's who trains our
boys at that facility.

1717
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:55,300
That guy does not know Jesus in
the NFL as an insane vertical jump.

1718
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:59,170
Yup. And he, he's a big fan of the
guys that he's out there all the time.

1719
01:42:59,171 --> 01:43:03,850
He tripped plays for a who was at the
Texas Titans. Um, but needless to say,

1720
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:08,730
what is the Texas tightens? The Texans
are Texans six. And is that NFL? Houston?

1721
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:13,240
It's an NFL team. Yeah. But
the soul out of the loop. Yeah.

1722
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:17,780
I'm not a big team sport guy,
so please excuse me. Um, yeah,

1723
01:43:17,781 --> 01:43:20,890
the only so many guys
in MMA at the same way,

1724
01:43:20,891 --> 01:43:25,110
like once you get used to fighting
everything else is like, yeah, I, Nah,

1725
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:27,100
it's not even that I don't have the time.

1726
01:43:27,130 --> 01:43:30,820
I'm so busy watching
my craft and then like,

1727
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:34,900
you know,
like I dunno about you on Sunday.

1728
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,110
I don't want to watch a bunch of
sweaty dudes who don't care about me.

1729
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:42,790
I'd rather hang out with a hot chick,
which before we were married,

1730
01:43:42,791 --> 01:43:45,440
it was my w you know,
I'd just, I'd rather, uh,

1731
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,870
get a little r and r if you
know what I'm saying. But what,

1732
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:51,950
get back to this Anthony Pettis.
So also the schedule,

1733
01:43:51,951 --> 01:43:56,470
the strength and conditioning is the
big ruler of what we do. It's through,

1734
01:43:56,510 --> 01:43:59,870
it's the recovery,
the active warmup act of recovery.

1735
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:02,840
But every Monday,
Wednesday,

1736
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:07,280
Friday he goes there on Mondays at one 30,
we have practice every day at one 30,

1737
01:44:07,281 --> 01:44:11,720
he works a striking based MMA practice
and then we have MMA sparring.

1738
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:14,210
Our hardest sparring is on a Monday.

1739
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:17,420
I believe we do that
because it's their freshest.

1740
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:20,180
So the injuries aren't going to happen.
I don't like to do smart.

1741
01:44:20,181 --> 01:44:23,360
And at the end of the week, they're
mentally, emotionally, physically drained.

1742
01:44:23,361 --> 01:44:26,770
That's when injuries are going to happen.
Does he do the sparring before,

1743
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:28,280
after the strength and
conditioning program?

1744
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:31,420
After the strength and conditioning
to that'd be counter intuitive.

1745
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,220
You'll probably be better off doing after.

1746
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:36,920
It's just the guys like doing
it first thing in the morning.

1747
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:40,040
They get it out of the way. And, and the,
the other thing I'll say about our smart,

1748
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:41,960
we've really backed off on the intensity.

1749
01:44:41,961 --> 01:44:45,590
We have a lot of good technical guys were,
I mean any,

1750
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:49,850
right now we're doing about three rounds,
a little bit harder a week. That's it.

1751
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:54,560
I'm really in everyone's wearing helmet,
everyone's wearing high and gear,

1752
01:44:54,710 --> 01:44:59,710
so no one's getting hurt because
it's those wild scrambles in MMA.

1753
01:45:00,171 --> 01:45:01,940
Were you getting weird positions,

1754
01:45:01,941 --> 01:45:06,050
the wrestling and awkward positions
where you getting hurt or collision? So,

1755
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:07,160
and then,
um,

1756
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:11,510
after that practice he'll rest up and
he'll come back and do a one on one pad

1757
01:45:11,511 --> 01:45:16,070
sessions with me, uh, work
in drilling and uh, you know,

1758
01:45:16,071 --> 01:45:20,360
fight specific game plan. So he'll
do on Monday, three times Tuesday,

1759
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:24,890
a little rest. He has the Tuesday,
he rolls real hard on those days.

1760
01:45:24,891 --> 01:45:26,270
It's Jujitsu practice.

1761
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:30,260
And then again at night
he'll come back pad work,

1762
01:45:30,261 --> 01:45:33,590
drilling a Wednesday is
wrestling day with Max or Ben,

1763
01:45:33,591 --> 01:45:38,150
ask him with the team and strength and
conditioning in the morning at night

1764
01:45:38,151 --> 01:45:42,470
again, pads, technique and you
set the schedule for him? Um,

1765
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:46,050
somewhat with the whole team
of everyone, you know, uh, our,

1766
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:51,120
our primary is in the evenings we do are
are white work technique and a lot of

1767
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:52,273
drilling.

1768
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:56,510
And so when he does his strength and
conditioning program is it based on five

1769
01:45:56,511 --> 01:45:57,860
round fights is based on,

1770
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:03,880
and the timing of the training we all
meet as coaches and we put together what

1771
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:09,370
the intensity each week opt down if
we're backing off tapering or if it's

1772
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:11,810
intense part of the camp.
Oh, fascinating. Yeah,

1773
01:46:11,811 --> 01:46:15,830
we really worked together like Anthony's
taking all the coaches that he works

1774
01:46:15,831 --> 01:46:17,150
with from our teams.

1775
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:20,090
So it's going to be great synergy
for the girls who are on his team.

1776
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:25,180
And that's the part where it's really
touchy to try to figure out how to peak

1777
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:26,940
and athlete. Correct. Yeah.

1778
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:32,150
I mean for folks who are not
familiar with that kind of training,

1779
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:35,020
you really can't keep it up for very long.
No,

1780
01:46:35,021 --> 01:46:37,900
you do what you're doing during
a six week camp. You can't,

1781
01:46:37,901 --> 01:46:40,760
you could never do all year round.
Yeah, we've really cut back.

1782
01:46:40,761 --> 01:46:45,680
We see my guys train all year round so
they don't need to do 10 12 week campaign.

1783
01:46:45,710 --> 01:46:49,440
10 12 Lee camps are for slackers
because they're trying to get in shape.

1784
01:46:49,441 --> 01:46:53,610
And Anthony took the Henderson
fight on a month's notice he had,

1785
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:56,940
he was at a going away party for
Danny boy downs in my backyard.

1786
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:01,760
He had a Negro Modelo in one hand and
a plate full of us take our chat on

1787
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:04,890
another hand and I said, Hey, um,

1788
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:08,910
Dana wants you to fight here in Milwaukee
versus Henderson might want to put the

1789
01:47:08,911 --> 01:47:13,350
beer down. He did. He was, he ran to his
father's grave. He went for a crazy run.

1790
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:18,810
Boom. Started running. And you know,
the point being, they're human beings,

1791
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,000
but if you're training all the time,

1792
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:25,440
it's a lot easier to take fights on short
notice. Like a guy like Donald Cerrone,

1793
01:47:25,470 --> 01:47:28,290
all the respect in the world.
He likes his Budweiser. What?

1794
01:47:28,291 --> 01:47:33,000
But he's training constantly, you know
what I mean? He's in, he's ready to fight.

1795
01:47:33,001 --> 01:47:35,120
He just mentioned he wants
to fight at one 70 of,

1796
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:38,640
if no one wants to buy them at 55 I love,
I love his attitude.

1797
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:43,240
I didn't like him when he fight Anthony.
But no, I re I, I liked Donald that,

1798
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:48,330
you know, you're my enemy when you're
fighting us. But I, I liked Donald.

1799
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:53,160
He, I love what he is, what he
represents. Like wow man, I love him.

1800
01:47:53,161 --> 01:47:56,820
And he's a savage. When you
say fighters, it's Serone. I,

1801
01:47:56,821 --> 01:48:00,280
you know what I love about him too? When
he's in his off time, he does crazy shit.

1802
01:48:00,281 --> 01:48:04,950
He's fucking jumping with jet skis
through there and done snowmobile jumps.

1803
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:07,950
You see that snowmobile shit.
This dude was training for his last fight.

1804
01:48:07,951 --> 01:48:10,950
Like what are you doing man?
It's on your Sunday.

1805
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:13,680
You have fight training
in the morning and you've,

1806
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:16,800
you've taken snowmobiles
over the top of this hill.

1807
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:23,130
No, I mean, I think you
know some of the best,

1808
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:27,150
what makes these fighters specialists
are great risk takers. You know,

1809
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:28,710
you gotta be,

1810
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:34,040
there's gotta be something special in
you that doesn't tick like other people

1811
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:38,970
that makes you want to get into a ring
and fight for amusement for people.

1812
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:42,450
I mean you for a bunch of people that
are going to go online and call you a

1813
01:48:42,451 --> 01:48:46,920
loser. Yeah. But you know people,

1814
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:50,970
what I miss the most about the fights,

1815
01:48:50,971 --> 01:48:54,360
it's not the Paparazzi.
I love that moment.

1816
01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:57,390
Especially if you're the main event,
you go back to the locker room,

1817
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:59,430
there's no one freaking there.

1818
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:02,860
Like people thought like when all
the people back to and walk in,

1819
01:49:02,861 --> 01:49:06,490
they're so supportive and we have this
big circle of people help out sex.

1820
01:49:06,570 --> 01:49:10,080
It wasn't when they Anthony one,
well we had a press conference.

1821
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:12,390
Everyone's long gone after
the press conference.

1822
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:15,030
So did the ring girls hang out with,
you know,

1823
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:19,710
what's their champagne in the
locker room? No, it was me, Anthony,

1824
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:24,630
and I forgot who else walked out of there
with our crap in the arena was close

1825
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,070
enough.
We could walk to the hotel.

1826
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:31,110
It was pretty lonely but not
lonely in a bad way. You know,

1827
01:49:31,111 --> 01:49:34,910
it's our own little La Cosa Nostra
this thing of ours. I like it.

1828
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:37,860
It being in a small circle and we what?

1829
01:49:37,861 --> 01:49:40,260
We share the people who
know what I'm talking about.

1830
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:45,320
It's like that's what I miss that moment
yourself when you've accomplished it,

1831
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,060
not the after five

1832
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:51,160
party. Not everyone. That's
cool. I appreciate that support.

1833
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:55,750
But I like the quiet moment after
like all that work, hard work,

1834
01:49:55,751 --> 01:49:59,800
dedication, the blood, sweat
and tears and you soak it in.

1835
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:03,160
Um,
that's what I miss more than anything.

1836
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:05,260
I am no one know what I miss.

1837
01:50:06,130 --> 01:50:09,790
I miss the most is I love it.

1838
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,920
That feeling when you get hands taped,

1839
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:16,240
it's like in gladiator when he grabs the
sand. Dude, you're getting a hand safe.

1840
01:50:16,241 --> 01:50:19,630
There's no turning back. You're,
you're fighting. You know, it's like,

1841
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:24,720
it's the best feeling in the
world, man. I'm a gold this though.

1842
01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:28,990
It seems to me like you want
to fight again. Always ready.

1843
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:34,420
It's a drug man. How old are you now?
I'm 44 do you stop and think like, look,

1844
01:50:34,421 --> 01:50:37,270
if I really want to fight again,
I kind of do it now.

1845
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:43,160
But you see guy like Bernard Hopkins give
you a little hope, always 49 years old.

1846
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:46,840
All the light heavyweight timing.
To me it's like,

1847
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:51,130
it's all comes down to time and schedule.
But that being said,

1848
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:55,150
I love my students so much of my fighters,
no one happened.

1849
01:50:55,151 --> 01:50:59,650
I'd start training and I'd stopped
cause I don't want to jeopardize their

1850
01:50:59,651 --> 01:51:03,700
success. You know, I miss it, you know?

1851
01:51:03,730 --> 01:51:08,530
But you know, it's like, uh,
you know, a cocaine addict, man,

1852
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:12,790
I'm missing, I'm going to say shit. You
know? But you're still getting some,

1853
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:15,880
a big amount of satisfaction
from training. Oh, you know,

1854
01:51:15,910 --> 01:51:20,830
there's nothing better than helping other
people fulfill their goals. Not even,

1855
01:51:20,831 --> 01:51:24,490
I'm not even just talking the fights,
but I come to the gym,

1856
01:51:24,491 --> 01:51:27,280
I spar with all my students.
We have a ball. I mean,

1857
01:51:27,281 --> 01:51:31,390
I'm seeing people change their lives
through martial arts. So that's what I,

1858
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:36,580
that's what I gotta do to keep my
drug in check. I got to spar a lot,

1859
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:41,650
train a lot, just to have fun.
When I get hurt and can't train,

1860
01:51:41,651 --> 01:51:45,130
that's when I like,
or I just,

1861
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:49,690
or if it gets too, I'm too busy and I
can't be on the mat actually doing it.

1862
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:51,370
That's when I get crazy thoughts.

1863
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:55,860
Like who I might need something to
motivate myself like a fight, you know,

1864
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,400
I try to justify these stupid stories
too in my brain. Why should do it?

1865
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:03,370
Do you ever justify like maybe
I should fight MMA? It'll help.

1866
01:52:03,371 --> 01:52:08,290
My MMA coach was supposed
to fight in 2007, um,

1867
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:12,550
for the CFC FFC the,
it was me.

1868
01:52:12,551 --> 01:52:17,551
I was going to fight this dude
Derek pains I kickboxer and then uh,

1869
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:21,580
Kimbo slice was fighting tank and
then the winter is our two fights.

1870
01:52:21,581 --> 01:52:23,800
We're going to fight each other.
So yeah,

1871
01:52:23,801 --> 01:52:26,890
I was training them and
I was into it and yeah,

1872
01:52:26,891 --> 01:52:31,090
I was digging it out and the thing fell
apart like 10 days before, you know,

1873
01:52:31,091 --> 01:52:34,550
Kimbo slice is apparently going to fight
for Bellatore. Yeah, I heard that. Yeah.

1874
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:39,130
That leg kick him now.
He's cool dude.

1875
01:52:39,131 --> 01:52:44,120
I met him when he fired Michio and I
mean when I trained Matt Mitrione, uh,

1876
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:45,830
for the five days good.
I mean,

1877
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,220
but no one, there are guys like
him who can come into our industry.

1878
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:50,570
They fight and they,
they,

1879
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:54,590
they have fans and I mean look good
Brock Lesnar did for our industry,

1880
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:57,910
but well bitch, Yo man, that
was a great performance by hand.

1881
01:52:57,911 --> 01:52:59,990
That was like one of his
best performances. Yeah.

1882
01:52:59,991 --> 01:53:04,940
I mean I just think stylistically, I
mean Matt, Matt told me this thing,

1883
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:09,620
he played in the NFL. He goes, I just
wasn't athletic enough to make in the NFL.

1884
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:13,550
I'm like, Jesus h Christ.
Then what are those guys?

1885
01:53:13,551 --> 01:53:17,720
Cause this dude is our freak
man. He's strong, fast,

1886
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:19,070
tenacious.

1887
01:53:19,071 --> 01:53:23,210
I mean all the attributes that you
want and a heavyweight ease is a big,

1888
01:53:23,211 --> 01:53:27,200
strong dude. Yeah. What do you
think is going on with him and MMA?

1889
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:30,230
Like what do you think about
his, uh, his MMA future?

1890
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:34,220
I mean he's training down at black
ceilings. I think it's a good fit for him.

1891
01:53:34,490 --> 01:53:36,710
Doesn't he have a fight coming up?
I think I forgot.

1892
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:41,090
It's just so hard to keep up
with everyone. But he is, I
think that's a good camp.

1893
01:53:41,091 --> 01:53:44,060
They got the right size guys.
Cause I mean I can't help man.

1894
01:53:44,070 --> 01:53:46,850
I don't have any big guys. I
was like, man, he's cool. He's,

1895
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:50,730
and some people they saw the show,
they don't understand that guy's awesome.

1896
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:55,520
And at head games credible, he knows how
to get in people's with people. Yeah.

1897
01:53:55,521 --> 01:53:57,560
I mean I think that that uh,

1898
01:53:57,860 --> 01:54:02,690
that verbal a Jiu Jitsu judo and
Jedi mind tricks, it's so important.

1899
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:03,441
Yeah.

1900
01:54:03,441 --> 01:54:08,300
It is right that that is an extra added
element to psychological warfare and

1901
01:54:08,301 --> 01:54:11,370
fuck with a guy and get inside his
head before a fight. Right. Well, um,

1902
01:54:11,450 --> 01:54:12,680
I'm the youngest of,

1903
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:15,920
for the longest time I was being youngest
brother and my family before I had my

1904
01:54:15,921 --> 01:54:18,320
younger brothers.
My Dad has five brothers.

1905
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:21,980
His two youngest brothers are almost
the same age as my two older brothers.

1906
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:24,800
So basically I got tormented growing up.

1907
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:30,110
So the only way I could mess with people
for a while was verbally and I had to

1908
01:54:30,111 --> 01:54:34,970
learn how to mass with them fall
break. You know, just, just, uh,

1909
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:40,280
you know, and then I started, I
didn't do it at first and fighting.

1910
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:42,350
That's how I got a little
older then. I, you know,

1911
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:44,570
started using little Jedi mind tricks.

1912
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,840
It's amazing how many good fighters come
from a background where their brothers

1913
01:54:47,841 --> 01:54:52,040
picked him up and made, it. Makes
you kind of look at John Jones,

1914
01:54:52,430 --> 01:54:57,110
two big giant super athlete brothers.
Here's, here's, here's our cool story.

1915
01:54:57,111 --> 01:55:01,550
My really good friend from Greek community
in Milwaukee played for the eagles

1916
01:55:01,551 --> 01:55:04,460
for many years. He started, he opened
up the strength and conditioning place.

1917
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:09,170
My boys train it. He, he's the agent
for Jon Jones brothers and the NFL.

1918
01:55:09,210 --> 01:55:11,740
Wow. Huge, huge MMA fan too. He was the,

1919
01:55:11,741 --> 01:55:15,650
he played for the eagles for many years
and Rosebowl cabin in Wisconsin. Yeah.

1920
01:55:15,651 --> 01:55:18,830
Those guys are huge. They make John
Look like he's like just a little wimp.

1921
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:20,480
John is a freak.
Oh No.

1922
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:25,490
It really isn't the nicest compliment
I've gotten from someone at UFC 100 towns

1923
01:55:25,491 --> 01:55:29,300
that he learned how to strike from my
DVDs from the old school. I like Johnny,

1924
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:32,660
you know, uh, we have a great
relationship. He's a cool dude.

1925
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:34,850
He really is a freak man.
I mean,

1926
01:55:34,851 --> 01:55:39,851
you want to talk about a
guy that's learned quickly
and has his own way of doing

1927
01:55:39,981 --> 01:55:43,980
things and the best at utilizing reach.
Not a second guy

1928
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:47,340
I've ever seen fight that knows how to
keep a guy in his range better than John.

1929
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:52,080
I liked DC a lot. I think DC could give
him some troubles, but the thing is,

1930
01:55:52,230 --> 01:55:57,230
John still is so good at what he does
and that reach plays such a factor.

1931
01:55:57,771 --> 01:56:01,440
Huge factor. Yeah. I mean John's going to
get better too. Yeah. That's the thing.

1932
01:56:01,441 --> 01:56:03,420
He's going to,
if you fight him six months from now,

1933
01:56:03,421 --> 01:56:05,400
he's going to be a better fighter.
You fight him a year from now,

1934
01:56:05,401 --> 01:56:08,340
he's going to be even better and DC
is going to go to surgery in July.

1935
01:56:08,341 --> 01:56:09,420
He's getting his knee redone,

1936
01:56:09,421 --> 01:56:13,290
his ACL is fucked and apparently it's
got some other damage going on in there,

1937
01:56:13,291 --> 01:56:15,180
so he's going to get crazy.
These wrestlers,

1938
01:56:15,181 --> 01:56:18,660
how they can continue to train what
their knee like. Knock on wood,

1939
01:56:18,661 --> 01:56:21,300
I've never had any knee injuries. I
don't know what it's all about. Like,

1940
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:23,460
well Chris Weidman,
before he got his knees fixed,

1941
01:56:23,461 --> 01:56:26,910
he got meniscus scoped on both of
his knees. He had terrible knees.

1942
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:30,300
They said that he couldn't even get
as heel to touch his ass. Just crazy.

1943
01:56:30,301 --> 01:56:32,070
He's fighting for the world title and he,
you know,

1944
01:56:32,071 --> 01:56:34,800
he doesn't have full use of his legs,
but he's still,

1945
01:56:34,801 --> 01:56:38,670
he has enough that he can force himself
into positions where it doesn't matter.

1946
01:56:39,090 --> 01:56:43,560
It's just incredible. All right,
let's talk striking who, let's,

1947
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:45,090
I want to pick your brain.

1948
01:56:45,650 --> 01:56:50,130
Who's the greatest kick boxer
of all time in your opinion?

1949
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:53,490
Ramon Decker deck or a rob came in.
Those are,

1950
01:56:53,491 --> 01:56:56,390
those are the two guys that I look
up to other than the ties. This,

1951
01:56:56,410 --> 01:57:00,510
there's some great ties.
Yeah. I mean, there's so many
great tie fighters. For me,

1952
01:57:00,511 --> 01:57:03,570
I love decker style, but
for me, rob, I mean rob,

1953
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:07,230
rob is a big influence in
everything I did. I, I went,

1954
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:10,130
the reason why I went to my first
gym in Thailand. So you're talking,

1955
01:57:10,131 --> 01:57:13,770
cause rob went there like I saw rob,
there's a great fight.

1956
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:18,030
He beats her Nesto who's, Oh yeah,
with low kicks and a Hook Kale.

1957
01:57:18,031 --> 01:57:20,370
But I mean Ernesto,
super athletic,

1958
01:57:20,371 --> 01:57:23,520
but rob systematically
broke them down and I,

1959
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:28,650
and I really enjoy fighters who know how
to systematically break someone down.

1960
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:33,390
Um, greatest boxer of all
time. I would say, you know,

1961
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:36,810
classically people say
Sugar Ray Robinson and a,

1962
01:57:36,811 --> 01:57:38,820
I think sugar ray Robinson
is probably one of the all,

1963
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:43,560
I look at it as terms of errors. Okay.
Cause I don't think anybody ever,

1964
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:46,740
if you look at their entire career,
yeah. You know, you could say,

1965
01:57:46,741 --> 01:57:51,090
well this guy was better that
guy, but what ad is best? Julio,

1966
01:57:51,091 --> 01:57:54,180
Cesar Chavez was one of the
most impressive of all time.

1967
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:58,850
He had this unrelenting
marauding style where he,

1968
01:57:59,050 --> 01:58:02,940
he never threw everything in
every punch like Mike Tyson style,

1969
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:06,600
but he just wore you away.
He would just come at you.

1970
01:58:06,601 --> 01:58:10,650
And Andy was in a strong era of
fighters. Yeah, very strong. I'm like,

1971
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:14,880
look at his fight against Meldrick Taylor
systematically broke his body down,

1972
01:58:14,970 --> 01:58:18,330
broke his and change Meldrick.
Meldrick was never the same. You know,

1973
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:22,620
that fight broke him. If you've seen
the legendary nights about that on HBO,

1974
01:58:23,090 --> 01:58:24,300
it's very sad.

1975
01:58:24,570 --> 01:58:27,930
I think Roy Jones Jr and its prime
was one of the greatest of all time.

1976
01:58:27,931 --> 01:58:30,960
There was a window where Roy
Jones Jr was untouchable.

1977
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:36,440
The only fighter ever to have gone a
single round without a single punch scored

1978
01:58:36,511 --> 01:58:41,040
on him. The Vinny Pazienza fight, it's
only fighting copy box history. They go,

1979
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:45,310
one guy landed, you know, x amount of
punches and the other guy landed zero.

1980
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:50,320
That's madness in a professional boxing
match. Roy Jones, when he was at his best,

1981
01:58:50,321 --> 01:58:54,280
was a fucking freaked, wasn't
technically sound, you know,

1982
01:58:54,281 --> 01:58:58,060
relied on his reflexes but knew
his body and knew his skills,

1983
01:58:58,061 --> 01:58:59,560
you could say wasn't technically sound,

1984
01:58:59,561 --> 01:59:02,590
but nobody was hitting him and
told Tarver knocked him out.

1985
01:59:02,770 --> 01:59:04,780
No one was hitting him.
He was fun to watch.

1986
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:08,590
You know the Rooster Punch you through.
You know where I think he fucked up.

1987
01:59:09,070 --> 01:59:11,570
Where I think he fucked up is,
I think when he went up to heavyweight,

1988
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:13,060
he went all the way up to heavyweight.

1989
01:59:13,061 --> 01:59:16,510
He got real big and then he went
back down to light heavyweight.

1990
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:20,610
It messed his body up. You can fuck to
his body up. He looked like shit when he,

1991
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:22,390
his body physically looked like shit.

1992
01:59:22,690 --> 01:59:26,620
And I think also hormonally he looked
like shit because let's be honest about

1993
01:59:26,621 --> 01:59:27,580
how he got up to heavyweight.

1994
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:31,320
He didn't get up to heavyweight taking
fucking friends stone's chewables. Right.

1995
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:36,280
He had some help. And when you're in
your thirties especially, you know,

1996
01:59:36,281 --> 01:59:38,640
your body doesn't bounce back
very quick from steroids.

1997
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:41,580
You see someone pulled on over
20 pounds of muscle quickly.

1998
01:59:42,110 --> 01:59:46,300
It's just can't be done
unfortunately. Yeah. Pull up. Um,

1999
01:59:46,570 --> 01:59:49,210
Roy Jones Jr versus John Ruiz.

2000
01:59:50,030 --> 01:59:54,280
You could see how good he was that he
was a fucking former form middleweight in

2001
01:59:54,281 --> 01:59:57,400
the Olympics. Fought one the
super middleweight championship,

2002
01:59:57,401 --> 01:59:58,780
won the light heavyweight championship,

2003
01:59:58,781 --> 02:00:03,610
went up to fucking heavyweight outbox
they shit out of John Ruiz who was a

2004
02:00:03,611 --> 02:00:06,080
former heavyweight champion,
you know from your area, right?

2005
02:00:06,110 --> 02:00:10,250
Is he quiet man from Boston? Who
is he? Is he with Petronellis or,

2006
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:14,380
I don't think he was. John Ruiz was with
somebody else. Right. But look at this.

2007
02:00:14,410 --> 02:00:17,170
This is Roy.
I mean he was thick as shit.

2008
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:20,770
That's way thicker than you ever
saw him at a light heavyweight.

2009
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:24,190
But he was only about 200
pounds. You know, even even then,

2010
02:00:24,191 --> 02:00:27,040
like even as a heavyweight,
it was all about speed and movement,

2011
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:30,550
but he was so good and so hard to hit,
you know,

2012
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:32,980
Jones Jr when he was at his prime man,
you know,

2013
02:00:32,981 --> 02:00:37,981
it was a big over achiever and I use this
style to teach people well as a Oscar

2014
02:00:38,110 --> 02:00:42,790
de la Hoya, before he switched with
Floyd senior, his nineties fights.

2015
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:44,800
He was an incredible over achiever,

2016
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:49,110
a big fucking Roy Jones is in this fight
that he had never been that muscular

2017
02:00:49,130 --> 02:00:49,960
before.

2018
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:53,740
And then he went from that to the Tarver
fight and he just looked terrible and

2019
02:00:53,741 --> 02:00:58,210
car Tarver knocked him out. And then
after that, Glenn Johnson knocked him out.

2020
02:00:58,211 --> 02:01:01,810
And that was even scarier
because he went out from a punch.

2021
02:01:01,811 --> 02:01:03,850
It didn't even look like
that big of a punch,

2022
02:01:03,851 --> 02:01:08,851
but was out completely out cold like
next if to hang out with Roy last year at

2023
02:01:11,201 --> 02:01:15,520
been aspirins, last bellatore
fight. He was there. And,
uh, Albuquerque, cool dude,

2024
02:01:15,610 --> 02:01:18,760
great guy. Great Guy. I got a chance
to meet him in Vegas recently.

2025
02:01:18,761 --> 02:01:19,660
It's a picture with him.

2026
02:01:19,661 --> 02:01:24,140
I was so excited that I was with Evander
Holyfield and uh, if there's, uh,

2027
02:01:24,370 --> 02:01:27,210
Croatia, he's school. I mean, uh,

2028
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:31,660
my brother used to box at crunk and
I got to meet Tommy Hearns. Nice.

2029
02:01:33,050 --> 02:01:37,930
I, you know, I've, I've, uh, met a lot
of cool old school box and guys, that's,

2030
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:40,130
I mean there's this something we grew up

2031
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:41,270
on that sport.
You can't,

2032
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:44,510
you don't discard it and you
don't think about Roy Jones.

2033
02:01:44,511 --> 02:01:49,310
Man is that he never had his Joe Frazier,
he never had his Tommy Hearns.

2034
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:51,930
He never had like Tommy Hearns had
Leonard Leonard. Do you know, they,

2035
02:01:51,931 --> 02:01:56,090
they had each other, they
had that rivalry. Roy Jones
was just so above everybody.

2036
02:01:56,091 --> 02:01:59,980
He had nothing until Tarver knocked him
out. There was really no rivalry. Yeah,

2037
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:03,140
you're right about that. Hey, here's
a, you just made me think of something.

2038
02:02:03,141 --> 02:02:07,970
You know Tommy Hearns verse Leonard the
first fight, if that's in the modern era.

2039
02:02:08,390 --> 02:02:11,810
Oh yeah. Hurting this one. Cause
it was a 15 rounder. That's right.

2040
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:15,050
If it would have been a 12 rounder, he
would have won that fight. That's right.

2041
02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:19,100
You know the 15 rounders stopped after
boom, boom. Manzini knocked out duck.

2042
02:02:19,101 --> 02:02:23,270
Who Cam right is. That's
when they stopped. I think
they'll, yeah. Duck cook him.

2043
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:27,140
Dot 15 rounds. It's insane.
Long fucking 12 rounds.

2044
02:02:27,141 --> 02:02:31,190
We used to do kickboxing rules,
12 times two stupidest thing ever.

2045
02:02:31,191 --> 02:02:35,210
Getting off the stool 11 times. No,
let's do one round. I don't want to,

2046
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:40,040
I don't want to sit down now.
Modern kickboxing.

2047
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:44,300
The the championship fights are only
three rounds or five rounds. Five rounds.

2048
02:02:44,301 --> 02:02:47,840
Yeah. Yeah. I'd like to
see boxing. Shrink it down.

2049
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:50,240
What'd you really enforce?
The action.

2050
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:54,500
I think that's why MMA
and kickboxing or growing.

2051
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:58,870
What would you think boxing should be?
Eight eight rounds. Really? Yeah. I mean,

2052
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:02,990
think about our culture.
You want to know what Joe Rogan is doing?

2053
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:04,730
You can click on Twitter,
Facebook,

2054
02:03:04,731 --> 02:03:09,170
everything you want to order some cool
stuff from Joe Rogan's shopping cart.

2055
02:03:09,171 --> 02:03:12,140
You can click now. You want to go onto
the Duke group, his striking university.

2056
02:03:12,141 --> 02:03:16,610
You can click now, get whatever you want.
But that's our culture. We're fast food.

2057
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,670
You know, sometimes a boxing
fight, it's like jazz.

2058
02:03:19,671 --> 02:03:23,990
You got to wait for the jam to pick
up. We're so fast food, everything.

2059
02:03:24,020 --> 02:03:28,820
That's what, why I love MMA and
kickboxing. The actions like now and then,

2060
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:31,370
oh that fights over and knock out.
Cool. Let's bring another fight.

2061
02:03:31,670 --> 02:03:34,400
Like a fight like the my Donna
Mayweather fight where my Donna,

2062
02:03:34,401 --> 02:03:36,260
that comes on strong in the beginning,

2063
02:03:36,261 --> 02:03:40,040
but Floyd levels amount and starts to
pick up the pace and the fifth and six

2064
02:03:40,041 --> 02:03:42,740
rounds and starts to
write down the stretch.

2065
02:03:42,830 --> 02:03:46,010
For the guys who are making a lot
of money, the 12 renders her great.

2066
02:03:46,430 --> 02:03:50,210
The guys who find on ESPN Friday night
fights for 10 and 12 they're making 10

2067
02:03:50,211 --> 02:03:52,760
grand, right? And then
they're so busted up,

2068
02:03:52,761 --> 02:03:56,240
they can't fight as much as
kickboxers and MMA fighters.

2069
02:03:56,241 --> 02:03:58,250
How did it make a living?
How do they survive?

2070
02:03:58,550 --> 02:04:03,200
I mean that's the tough thing about boxing
those long. I'd like to see, you know,

2071
02:04:03,201 --> 02:04:06,800
and I've never understood why they go
even rounds because you got a better

2072
02:04:06,801 --> 02:04:10,600
chance for a drug that is true,
right? Yeah. Go nine rounds. Yeah.

2073
02:04:10,670 --> 02:04:14,900
We'd have a better chance for
a victory. Yeah. I mean, or
11 rounds. Yeah. Something.

2074
02:04:14,901 --> 02:04:19,210
I mean, you know, it's uh, just
one of those things. I mean, I,

2075
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:24,260
I do like the title fights, but I just
think for the guys brains, everything.

2076
02:04:24,261 --> 02:04:28,070
Like how about two 10 minute rounds.
Oh Wow. That would be interesting.

2077
02:04:28,071 --> 02:04:29,180
Could you do that with boxing?

2078
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:32,780
I would think that with boxing you'd
actually be easier to fight a 10 minute

2079
02:04:32,781 --> 02:04:34,100
around that it would to be to MMA.

2080
02:04:34,101 --> 02:04:38,070
Like those pride guys fought those
10 minute rounds. I had ends in any

2081
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:42,240
way here last week. Oh yeah.
Fucking awesome. So cool.
Talking to him. But you know,

2082
02:04:42,241 --> 02:04:45,390
that 10 round Mr younger more.
Yeah.

2083
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:49,190
That first 10 minute round man was brutal.

2084
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:53,460
You'd get into a crazy exchange
gassed out. You look up at the clock,

2085
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:58,380
eight minutes to go, what, eight
minutes to go. Yeah. I mean,

2086
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:01,350
and they were real made into standups too.

2087
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:06,330
They're just really like yellow card
if you're a passive. But I, yeah,

2088
02:05:06,331 --> 02:05:10,800
I fell in love with him and
May 1st with pride. So I, I
love pride. I use, you know,

2089
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:11,820
I was the one guy,

2090
02:05:11,821 --> 02:05:16,170
all the pride factor is
going to come over the wall.

2091
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:20,760
They were, I thought pride was fun to
watch, but from a tactical standpoint,

2092
02:05:20,761 --> 02:05:22,320
I would watch the way they would fight.
I would say,

2093
02:05:22,321 --> 02:05:27,321
well some guys are going to give people
some problems like Ninja and Shogun and

2094
02:05:27,690 --> 02:05:29,190
all these guys were going to
give people some problems.

2095
02:05:29,190 --> 02:05:33,150
But I would look at the like elite
of the elite guys and it's like, hmm,

2096
02:05:33,151 --> 02:05:36,290
I wasn't like George Saint Pierre
or someone like that. You know,

2097
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:40,800
someone in the higher weight divisions.
Well, I mean we saw it. Forrest Griffin.

2098
02:05:41,010 --> 02:05:45,930
Yeah, whipped show Shogun shogun
had some serious injuries.

2099
02:05:45,931 --> 02:05:49,470
Man Shogun for a while had some serious
knee problems, couldn't train hard.

2100
02:05:49,471 --> 02:05:53,640
And that's been the knock on Shogun
is the, that he doesn't really enjoy,

2101
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:57,480
like completely dedicated himself
to training and being, you know,

2102
02:05:57,481 --> 02:06:00,270
an animal in the gym constantly.
And if you're not that guy,

2103
02:06:00,271 --> 02:06:02,820
you're never going to be able to
compete with those world class fighters.

2104
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,850
You're not going to beat John Jones
if you don't like training. You know,

2105
02:06:05,851 --> 02:06:08,460
it's crazy. Nikki holds
can, can take this fight.

2106
02:06:08,790 --> 02:06:12,300
But if you follow his Twitter feed
and everything, like this dude is,

2107
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:16,440
he hadn't gotten a car accident when uh,
rape before the last Denver.

2108
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:19,320
That's why I didn't fight for the title.
They are broadening car patching,

2109
02:06:19,321 --> 02:06:20,400
but like,

2110
02:06:21,050 --> 02:06:25,200
but he's been training but he's still
didn't think he was ready for this fight.

2111
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:28,050
Like he's uh, the kid trains
all year round. I mean,

2112
02:06:28,110 --> 02:06:31,590
and that's the different like Mayweather,
the reason why Mayweather,

2113
02:06:31,730 --> 02:06:35,130
who is who he is. I mean he
likes to train, you know, and

2114
02:06:36,750 --> 02:06:40,080
guys, if you don't like your
craft then don't do it. Yeah.

2115
02:06:40,081 --> 02:06:43,110
There's a lot of people that just do
not like it anymore. I mean, you know,

2116
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:45,210
I talked to Mike Dolce who,
you know,

2117
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:49,080
he was working with rampage for one
time and it would just say the guy just,

2118
02:06:49,081 --> 02:06:49,891
he didn't want to train.

2119
02:06:49,891 --> 02:06:54,090
It would find candy wrappers like
tucked underneath his mattress.

2120
02:06:54,091 --> 02:06:58,380
He had hide candy in his bed and he just
didn't want to train and it's like so

2121
02:06:58,381 --> 02:07:00,060
hard when you've got a
guy who's so talented,

2122
02:07:00,340 --> 02:07:04,410
so good but just didn't want to do it
so hard to dry and then you've got other

2123
02:07:04,411 --> 02:07:05,340
guys who,

2124
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:08,700
you know they're supposed to be there
at five 50 they're there at five 30

2125
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:10,340
they're stretching out there,

2126
02:07:10,370 --> 02:07:15,370
they're skipping rope before the gym
opens and Pedis is La is the Lowe's on

2127
02:07:16,561 --> 02:07:21,561
fight and the Serone fight was back in
the gym Monday training Sergio Monday

2128
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:26,320
cause they know what they get so inspired.
Amen. Then polling checks for mind.

2129
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:29,610
That's what I love about the
UFC man. It's like, oh okay.

2130
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:33,360
I mean I was just counting up
bonus checks from some of the guys.

2131
02:07:33,361 --> 02:07:36,640
I think Alan Belcher's dump
300,000 just in bonuses

2132
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:39,250
from the UFC.
I mean I love that.

2133
02:07:39,251 --> 02:07:42,460
I I I'd like to see glory maybe do that.

2134
02:07:42,610 --> 02:07:46,210
I think that would make the fights even
crazier like knockout of the night,

2135
02:07:46,211 --> 02:07:50,470
move in the night and fight of the night.
Now, what is it like being on spike? Oh,

2136
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:54,340
enjoying that. Yeah. Yeah. I
mean it's great. I mean, uh,

2137
02:07:54,550 --> 02:07:58,120
the art productions pretty
cool. It's fun. I mean,

2138
02:07:58,750 --> 02:08:03,640
I definitely had to get better when I
was the third guy at k one it was so

2139
02:08:03,641 --> 02:08:07,990
different. I actually went to broadcast
school with Bruce back in New York,

2140
02:08:07,991 --> 02:08:09,550
the original UFC.
Yeah.

2141
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:14,140
He really gave me some good pointers
when I worked with him. He's awesome.

2142
02:08:14,141 --> 02:08:18,820
He helped me so much. Um, it's all about
your notes and preparing and you know,

2143
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:24,670
because I'm not a class, you know, so much
easier for you. You're, you're an actor.

2144
02:08:24,671 --> 02:08:28,510
You're a comedian. I, I can talk
right here. I'm getting a booth.

2145
02:08:28,540 --> 02:08:32,110
But those live opens, those
are tough. And you know those,

2146
02:08:32,111 --> 02:08:35,200
that's the toughest part for me. The
live opens, but we're getting better.

2147
02:08:35,380 --> 02:08:38,670
That's the easiest part for me
is the live that too, man. That,

2148
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:42,050
that is the easiest part of my day. You
know, we don't even rehearse it. Yeah.

2149
02:08:42,390 --> 02:08:44,680
Goldie doesn't even, they don't even
tell me what they're going to ask me.

2150
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:48,440
I think you guys have a really tight
production and we're getting there. Um,

2151
02:08:48,590 --> 02:08:51,520
you know, we're going to get some
more shows under about yeah, it's,

2152
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:54,400
that's what it is. Shows under your
belt. I'm having fun though. It actually,

2153
02:08:54,401 --> 02:08:58,540
the other thing that's really helping
me is my, my online striking university.

2154
02:08:58,541 --> 02:09:03,541
I teach so much on there and I'm filming
and I'm getting a camera since back

2155
02:09:04,601 --> 02:09:07,630
cause a that, that's really helped
me. I'm having a lot of fun with that.

2156
02:09:07,631 --> 02:09:10,720
I'm reaching people all over the world.
Kind of like what Eddie Bravo was doing.

2157
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:14,290
I got this a technique technique,
a training site.

2158
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:17,680
Now we have a affiliation too. So if you
want to affiliate with roof for sport,

2159
02:09:17,681 --> 02:09:19,990
kickboxing and a lot of cool benefits,

2160
02:09:19,991 --> 02:09:23,990
people can come train with me as much as
they want and it's having fun. You know,

2161
02:09:24,010 --> 02:09:26,800
it's a check me out@dukeroufus.com it's,

2162
02:09:26,860 --> 02:09:29,970
I'm having so much fun doing
it because I have, uh, I,

2163
02:09:30,310 --> 02:09:34,960
I even respond in my forum Q and a put up
cool videos. I, I'm a teacher at heart,

2164
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:39,820
so I love interacting. I have a
student now who's in from Ireland.

2165
02:09:39,830 --> 02:09:41,560
I've just had some coming from tech.

2166
02:09:41,590 --> 02:09:44,110
Like you were saying something
really cool about your university,

2167
02:09:44,111 --> 02:09:46,600
your online university debt.
When you sign up for it,

2168
02:09:46,601 --> 02:09:51,310
you get a free week at your gym. So I
decide to travel down to Mecca. Yeah.

2169
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:53,430
Wait a Milwaukee they could
train with you for oh yeah.

2170
02:09:53,431 --> 02:09:56,200
I mean I love it cause I mean
you never know who is training.

2171
02:09:56,201 --> 02:10:00,070
There's different guys visiting me and
you just don't get my kickbox and you get,

2172
02:10:00,190 --> 02:10:03,460
I like it, dude. It's a buffet. You
want to train wrestling with aspirin,

2173
02:10:03,700 --> 02:10:07,120
you want to train Jujitsu
and your boundary. You want
to train with the MMA team.

2174
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:09,750
Um, you know, hey, there's Anthony Pettis.

2175
02:10:09,770 --> 02:10:12,550
He uses playing around boxing
with a few guys have visited.

2176
02:10:12,850 --> 02:10:16,510
Like they taped it and everything and
that was cool. I mean, like I said,

2177
02:10:16,511 --> 02:10:21,190
I always say I have a great group
of guys at, at, at, at our team.

2178
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:24,430
I actually designed roof sport
to be like a camp in Thailand.

2179
02:10:24,431 --> 02:10:27,760
When I went to the timeline, all the
kids were so cool. The Thai kids,

2180
02:10:27,761 --> 02:10:31,600
they all help me. Especially if I
worked hard and had a good attitude.

2181
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:34,220
They all took me under their wing and,
and that's

2182
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:37,580
what I try and teach my guys. You
know, they're just very welcoming.

2183
02:10:37,581 --> 02:10:39,170
It's really good for my,
my,

2184
02:10:39,470 --> 02:10:43,210
my students because they get new looks
and new people to train with and it's

2185
02:10:43,211 --> 02:10:44,120
just a fun time.

2186
02:10:44,410 --> 02:10:45,310
That's awesome man.

2187
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:49,480
And your university is a great resource
for someone who maybe doesn't have a

2188
02:10:49,481 --> 02:10:53,260
Duke Roufus in their city cause it's
hard to find a really good high level

2189
02:10:53,261 --> 02:10:56,470
kickboxing camp. It's really
hard. You know, if you, you,

2190
02:10:56,471 --> 02:10:59,950
if you're stuck in a town that doesn't
have a good martial arts school,

2191
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:04,630
you can learn like really
high level instruction online.

2192
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:08,980
Apply those techniques, videotape
yourself, analyze it, compare yourself,

2193
02:11:09,220 --> 02:11:09,920
helps a lot.

2194
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:14,300
Yeah, I mean I, to me,
I'm still a video junkie.

2195
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:19,340
I mean Joe, Joe actually gave me some
pointers today, some new techniques.

2196
02:11:19,650 --> 02:11:23,840
We, we, we, we, we got into, we got
into the think tank today and you know,

2197
02:11:23,841 --> 02:11:25,820
and that I'm always looking for,

2198
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:30,990
it's a game of just
milliseconds in milliliters, eh,

2199
02:11:31,070 --> 02:11:35,270
or millimeters. It's that little thing
that will make the biggest thing happened.

2200
02:11:35,271 --> 02:11:39,980
People don't realize that, you know,
it's Anthony Pettis, a showtime kick. No,

2201
02:11:40,190 --> 02:11:42,830
it was four and a half
rounds of a great game plan.

2202
02:11:42,831 --> 02:11:47,540
He did executed doing great basics that
led to a special moment in his life.

2203
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:52,760
If he can do foot work, do the
proper punching, kicking, defend,

2204
02:11:52,761 --> 02:11:56,030
take downs, defense submissions
we would ever got there. Yes.

2205
02:11:56,420 --> 02:11:59,630
People look at the outcome. They don't
look at the journey. You know what I mean?

2206
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:04,880
You've got a w w we were joking,
Joe was doing a bad ass kick,

2207
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:08,570
his favorite and he has a good
quick side kick. And I said, Joe,

2208
02:12:08,571 --> 02:12:10,370
you'd got the 10,000 rule down.

2209
02:12:10,610 --> 02:12:14,510
They'd take see you 10,000 hours
to be an expert at something.

2210
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:18,710
And people don't realize that they want
it. You know, we have this culture. Yeah,

2211
02:12:18,711 --> 02:12:22,910
I do teach a lot of wild techniques, but
they work for the people who, you know,

2212
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:27,380
it's like I want to do a flying arm bar
in Jujitsu. Well, you can't do an arm bar.

2213
02:12:27,650 --> 02:12:31,220
You can't move your hips, you can't
shrimp, you have no idea of position.

2214
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:35,060
So why are you gonna do a flying arm
bar? You know, you to build up. Yeah,

2215
02:12:35,061 --> 02:12:38,450
definitely. And just like everyone
asked Ben when Ben asked her,

2216
02:12:38,451 --> 02:12:43,130
I want to do the flying Granby roll. No,
let's work on this boot verse. You know,

2217
02:12:43,131 --> 02:12:47,390
it's, I culturally, we live in
a ESPN sports center culture.

2218
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:51,440
You know what I mean? We don't see
the whole game. We saw the dunk,

2219
02:12:51,740 --> 02:12:55,160
we saw the home run,
we saw the cool soccer shot.

2220
02:12:55,161 --> 02:12:57,980
We didn't see the whole game of,
you know what I mean?

2221
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:01,030
Yeah. Well it's also what you were talking
about earlier about shrinking a boxing

2222
02:13:01,031 --> 02:13:03,410
match down to eight rounds or you know,

2223
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:06,530
be the fact that you could download
anything you want or order something on

2224
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:09,400
amazon.com with one click
this, this, want it.

2225
02:13:09,401 --> 02:13:11,770
Now thing that doesn't apply to MMA.

2226
02:13:11,771 --> 02:13:16,771
MMA is a mountain that you have to
build one grain of dirt at a time and it

2227
02:13:16,871 --> 02:13:20,320
takes a long fucking time to
become a martial arts master.

2228
02:13:20,470 --> 02:13:24,270
To be able to kick like Anthony Pettis
to be able to wrestle like bend askern,

2229
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:27,130
it takes thousands upon
thousands of hours.

2230
02:13:27,131 --> 02:13:29,740
And that's one of the things that we
were showing today that we were working

2231
02:13:29,741 --> 02:13:30,640
with like that.

2232
02:13:31,530 --> 02:13:34,350
The reason why people don't know how
to do it correctly is cause you don't,

2233
02:13:34,351 --> 02:13:36,030
you don't see anybody doing it like that.

2234
02:13:36,180 --> 02:13:39,450
So you see one person do it like
that and you go, oh, that's possible.

2235
02:13:39,570 --> 02:13:42,410
And that's all it takes.
You see one person that can bang,

2236
02:13:42,490 --> 02:13:46,110
that throws that thing like a fucking
lightning bolt and you go, oh, okay,

2237
02:13:46,111 --> 02:13:49,590
everybody else is doing it different.
But what you said about Anderson Silva,

2238
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:54,780
he kicks one dude in the face. There's
fun kicks every fight. Yeah, it's crazy.

2239
02:13:54,781 --> 02:13:57,780
What's, well Edson Barboza with
that we'll kick of Terry. Adam.

2240
02:13:57,781 --> 02:13:59,580
All of a sudden everyone wants
to throw wheel kicks, you know,

2241
02:13:59,581 --> 02:14:03,690
and then you see v toward do it to Luke
Rockhold and a junior dos Santos do it

2242
02:14:03,691 --> 02:14:04,590
to Mark Hunt to me.

2243
02:14:04,591 --> 02:14:08,880
You start to see that everybody knows
is this technique is really viable.

2244
02:14:08,881 --> 02:14:10,950
And they start seeing it
over and over and over again.

2245
02:14:10,951 --> 02:14:15,180
It's a copycat sport and a lot of ways,
I mean we all have healthy egos.

2246
02:14:15,181 --> 02:14:19,370
We all want to outdo one another.
We're all Alpha males there, you know,

2247
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:24,900
so the athletes themselves especially,
they want to one up each other. I mean,

2248
02:14:27,110 --> 02:14:28,350
Jujitsu question,

2249
02:14:29,190 --> 02:14:32,880
who can deal with Ron does armbar
that's a very good question.

2250
02:14:32,881 --> 02:14:34,620
We don't know because you know,

2251
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:39,100
you're seeing girls who have been able
to defend it a couple of times like Misha

2252
02:14:39,100 --> 02:14:41,490
Tate and the last fight
defended it a couple times.

2253
02:14:41,491 --> 02:14:45,150
I mean she did a really good job defending
it until she finally got caught. Um,

2254
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:47,760
bill look at a mean.
There's,

2255
02:14:48,150 --> 02:14:52,830
I think Liz Carmouche show that there's
some holes and Ron as game with that

2256
02:14:52,831 --> 02:14:54,000
take down that she likes to do,

2257
02:14:54,150 --> 02:14:57,600
cause she likes to grab the headlock
and throw girls down to the ground and

2258
02:14:57,601 --> 02:15:01,670
essentially giving up our bag. She gave
up the hooks and then she got, you know,

2259
02:15:01,830 --> 02:15:05,580
look with, she got away with
it with Liz Carmouche who,

2260
02:15:05,581 --> 02:15:10,290
I don't know what belt she is, but
she can't close, does fucked her job.

2261
02:15:10,291 --> 02:15:15,020
And Rhonda had to uh, actually like rely
on her neck to try to release the hook.

2262
02:15:15,020 --> 02:15:19,080
She had to let go and just to not defend
for a second and then got out of it.

2263
02:15:19,081 --> 02:15:21,750
Luckily. But she was tweaked. I
mean she couldn't chew food right.

2264
02:15:21,751 --> 02:15:25,230
For like a week after that.
If that happened.

2265
02:15:25,231 --> 02:15:29,340
And let's say it's some real high level
world champion, Brazilian Jujitsu,

2266
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:33,150
black belt, what would happen then? I mean
that's going to be really interesting.

2267
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,360
But then again,
the Ronda Rousey,

2268
02:15:35,361 --> 02:15:38,610
the fought Liz Carmouche and Ronda
Rousey that you're going to get today.

2269
02:15:38,850 --> 02:15:42,060
You getting a way better, Rhonda,
you're getting, uh, Rhonda.

2270
02:15:42,061 --> 02:15:44,760
That's way better in the
clinch at delivering shots.

2271
02:15:45,150 --> 02:15:48,120
Like Sara McMahon knocked her
out with that fucking liver body.

2272
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:52,680
Then the new deliver, she's just
getting better. She's not stopping.

2273
02:15:52,681 --> 02:15:55,020
She's going to continue and
she's getting more comfortable.

2274
02:15:55,170 --> 02:15:58,170
She's getting more relaxed with fighting.
She's getting more relaxed.

2275
02:15:58,171 --> 02:16:00,120
The fact that she's the UFC champion,

2276
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:04,140
so it's going to be really hard for
someone to deal with that. Yeah, it works.

2277
02:16:04,141 --> 02:16:08,490
Davis has got a tough task, but she's
tough. She's very tough. But I mean,

2278
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:12,750
uh, that's that one
signature move. It's crazy.

2279
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:16,560
It's only been a few guys that
have like a one signature move.

2280
02:16:16,561 --> 02:16:19,500
They continued to pull off over and
over again. Paul Sas comes to mind.

2281
02:16:20,290 --> 02:16:24,180
Submitted more guys by triangle than
anybody I could think of. He's a,

2282
02:16:24,240 --> 02:16:27,450
he's got a lot of wins by triangle.
His triangle is fucking wicked.

2283
02:16:27,690 --> 02:16:31,680
If you get on the, he just it down.
It's just going it down. Alright.

2284
02:16:32,260 --> 02:16:36,730
Greatest Jujitsu fighter. Just
Jujitsu. Not MMA greatest.

2285
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:41,230
The most impressive I've ever seen is
Marcella Garcia. Yeah, most impressive.

2286
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:46,260
I got to see him alive in 2003 in Sao
Paulo when he emerged onto the scene when

2287
02:16:46,601 --> 02:16:48,160
he fought Shaolin. Yeah. Yeah.

2288
02:16:48,190 --> 02:16:52,540
And he hit Shaolin with an arm drag and
he took his back and Shaolin rolled and

2289
02:16:52,541 --> 02:16:55,960
he kept rolling with them. They roll.
Roll, roll roll until the time is done.

2290
02:16:55,961 --> 02:17:00,040
Rolling. Charlene was asleep.
Wow. I mean it was just wicked,

2291
02:17:00,041 --> 02:17:04,780
wicked speed. And his squeeze
and his technique, he was,

2292
02:17:04,781 --> 02:17:07,720
he's the most impressive
I've ever seen in real life.

2293
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:11,530
But I've seen him lose in real life to
shock array. Tapped him. I saw shocker.

2294
02:17:11,531 --> 02:17:15,790
Right? Shocker. Ray was very clever. He
pulled guard and and got them into Kamora.

2295
02:17:15,850 --> 02:17:18,710
Just fucking snapped his arm back
and it Komora like on right away.

2296
02:17:19,010 --> 02:17:22,060
All high level dudes. Yes. MMA grappling.

2297
02:17:24,790 --> 02:17:29,770
Well, grappling. Grappling. Okay. This
grappling and then there's submissions.

2298
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:33,850
Okay. Submissions. I've seen some pretty
impressive MMA submission performances.

2299
02:17:33,851 --> 02:17:37,810
Damien Maia, when he submitted Rick story,
I mean that is pretty God damn wicked.

2300
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:39,130
My is one of the best.

2301
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:44,170
But like wrestling or a jock or
raise a beast for sure. You know,

2302
02:17:44,171 --> 02:17:45,070
he's one of the best,

2303
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:50,170
but fucking Ben [inaudible] of the best
grapplers as far as a guy who could take

2304
02:17:50,171 --> 02:17:53,710
a guy that's a really tough,
like really dangerous,

2305
02:17:53,711 --> 02:17:55,240
big lightweight,

2306
02:17:55,390 --> 02:18:00,070
really strong or welterweight rather big
strong guy and just toss them around.

2307
02:18:00,071 --> 02:18:03,580
Ragdoll I'm taking them down at
will guy can't defend against it.

2308
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:06,940
Aspirin is impressive as fucking
shit when it comes to that man.

2309
02:18:07,150 --> 02:18:08,290
Really impressive.

2310
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:13,450
One of the reasons why me as a fan
of just the martial arts period,

2311
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:18,610
I'm a fan of, I want, I think that one of
the things that martial arts represents,

2312
02:18:18,611 --> 02:18:22,810
what mixed martial arts represents
is potential scenarios and how do you

2313
02:18:22,811 --> 02:18:25,510
overcome potential scenarios
if everybody agreed, okay,

2314
02:18:25,511 --> 02:18:28,340
let's no more take downs from now on.
No more take downs though.

2315
02:18:28,350 --> 02:18:31,840
An MMA would just become kickboxing
and there's fights where that happens.

2316
02:18:31,990 --> 02:18:34,620
There are fights where that happens,
but they're true.

2317
02:18:34,630 --> 02:18:38,530
Stick of standing Wang is,
as Bj would say,

2318
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:40,060
Wayne take 'em down.

2319
02:18:41,130 --> 02:18:45,820
Like I can't stand watching guys. Not
that they suck. Good striking like, dude,

2320
02:18:46,150 --> 02:18:50,530
you're really good at wrestling. Like a
bunch of it must that suck for Andy Wang.

2321
02:18:51,510 --> 02:18:52,540
Wang Bro.

2322
02:18:53,530 --> 02:18:58,000
Cause it's about based on his high level
presented Jujitsu black belt decided to

2323
02:18:58,001 --> 02:19:01,000
stand with people. But he's like,
what the fuck is he doing? Well,

2324
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:02,100
here's a fact back then.

2325
02:19:02,110 --> 02:19:06,010
I tell people constantly and I,
I um,

2326
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:09,850
I don't think I'm going to get good
enough to submit guys like you,

2327
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:14,260
Mark Jujitsu borough, Daniel
Voll underway. I'm Anita,

2328
02:19:14,390 --> 02:19:17,230
a cannon to take Minastrin down.
Fact,

2329
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:22,660
fact is you can knock me out, Ben, conduct
me out and Daniel could knock me out.

2330
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:27,650
Striking mathematically is a
much more chaotic sport right?

2331
02:19:27,651 --> 02:19:28,280
By Zig

2332
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:31,640
when I should is ag. I get
knocked out. There's no hate.

2333
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:35,600
Duke luckily tapped me with no,
there's no walking, Jujitsu,

2334
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:39,410
maybe an MMA. If I hit you
enough and you fall into leap,

2335
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:42,380
you can stay and get caught in an arm bar.
But you know,

2336
02:19:42,410 --> 02:19:45,710
it's not as easy as there
was no walkie punches.

2337
02:19:45,711 --> 02:19:48,920
But if I zig when I could have
you go to sleep easy and striking.

2338
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:50,660
So if you're not,

2339
02:19:50,810 --> 02:19:55,100
that's why I teach all my guys to
make sure they get good at wrestling.

2340
02:19:55,340 --> 02:19:58,550
Make sure they get good at Jujitsu
because if you're struggling,

2341
02:19:58,551 --> 02:20:02,600
say you break your hand. Wait a minute, I
hurt my foot. Let's take this to the mat.

2342
02:20:03,140 --> 02:20:05,750
Like an MMA striking.

2343
02:20:05,751 --> 02:20:10,400
If it doesn't work can be your downfall
really bad. And especially with hands.

2344
02:20:10,401 --> 02:20:13,460
Hands are so easy to break. You hit
someone on the forehead, your mind,

2345
02:20:13,461 --> 02:20:17,660
and it's just so jacked from years and
that's what just normal gloves, man.

2346
02:20:17,870 --> 02:20:22,190
My hand, it's just maimed. Yeah.
You have like one shorter knuckle.

2347
02:20:22,290 --> 02:20:26,270
It's smashed out of there. Whoa,
that's crazy. Yeah, it's missing.

2348
02:20:26,271 --> 02:20:30,170
That one's really overdeveloped.
Am I? My hands are bad.

2349
02:20:30,171 --> 02:20:33,800
It's been broken back there. There's
a metatarsal there. Pop. Oh yeah.

2350
02:20:33,830 --> 02:20:38,060
You get it fixed or to just, um, I've
gotten a cast but it just, you know,

2351
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:42,450
the years of doing it, it just, does it
hurt when you punch with it now? No. What?

2352
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:46,460
You catch somebody with that funky
knuckle? This one or that one? This one.

2353
02:20:46,461 --> 02:20:49,660
The first one. This. Yeah. But I have to,

2354
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:54,140
I have to put a bumper in there if I,
if I'm going to fight again how bumper.

2355
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:58,640
Yeah. But a nice little gauze pad
in there to make it even so, yeah,

2356
02:20:58,670 --> 02:21:01,470
thanks to my main stitch, he showed
me how to fix that. Well, you know,

2357
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:04,730
vittores broken his hand.
Something ridiculous like eight times.

2358
02:21:04,790 --> 02:21:08,690
He said seven operations on his
hands. Yeah. It's just the MMA gloves.

2359
02:21:08,750 --> 02:21:13,160
You got to learn how to punch accordingly
with an MMA glove. You can't swing.

2360
02:21:13,370 --> 02:21:16,370
Remember when your, your AIA
through down with, um, like Brown,

2361
02:21:16,850 --> 02:21:20,990
both paws were smashed. Broke
both his hands. Yeah. I mean,
dude, early in the fight.

2362
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:25,190
Yeah. Man. Uriah, he's a really
good friend of mine, man.

2363
02:21:25,191 --> 02:21:29,450
That guy has an incredible heart. There's
no quit in favor. Mental tough. Yeah.

2364
02:21:29,451 --> 02:21:34,190
Like dude, I remember when he got carried
out of the cage by Master Tong and,

2365
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:38,780
and uh, Fabio Prado after his leg
with, although he lost the fight,

2366
02:21:38,781 --> 02:21:41,480
but there was no way
that guy was quitting.

2367
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:45,320
And that's why I respect a lot
about your idea, you know? I mean,

2368
02:21:45,590 --> 02:21:49,610
he's one of those great fighters who
I not get the UFC title, but man,

2369
02:21:49,611 --> 02:21:54,260
he's got heart and that, that just,
he can't put a price on that. Crazy.

2370
02:21:54,261 --> 02:21:59,261
Would it be if Tj Dillashaw beats Borow
again to rematch and then we see Uriah

2371
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:02,210
versus Tj. Wow. That's possible. Yeah.

2372
02:22:02,211 --> 02:22:05,420
I mean that's the hard thing when you
have a lot of fighters in the same weight

2373
02:22:05,421 --> 02:22:08,930
and your gym. I mean everyone's the
same squirrel going after the same nut,

2374
02:22:09,170 --> 02:22:13,280
the ball and Kira Petchem we're sparring
the week that he got the call for the

2375
02:22:13,281 --> 02:22:17,700
fight, then they had to go fight each
other. It was like that movie, uh,

2376
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:23,040
with um, with a woody
Harrelson. And who's the spin?

2377
02:22:23,060 --> 02:22:26,140
Antonio Banderas remember the
boxing movie? They had the drive

2378
02:22:26,140 --> 02:22:29,580
to the fight together heavy. Are they both
trained in Holland? What'd we say? Hey,

2379
02:22:29,581 --> 02:22:30,810
you're on the same flight as me.

2380
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:33,990
That's happened to me where I've been
on the same flight as a guy. Well,

2381
02:22:34,040 --> 02:22:37,770
you know that you see with MMA guys being
real friendly with each other before

2382
02:22:37,771 --> 02:22:40,320
they fight in a way that you
never really see with boxing.

2383
02:22:41,050 --> 02:22:43,790
My why is that you think?
You know,

2384
02:22:44,490 --> 02:22:49,350
I think I noticed wrestlers
will wrestle each other. Train,

2385
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:51,870
wrestle each other.
Train. Same with Jujitsu.

2386
02:22:52,350 --> 02:22:55,320
We're like in Thailand,
everyone's respectful,

2387
02:22:55,321 --> 02:22:58,710
but no one trains with each other in
the hall when they're good sportsman,

2388
02:22:58,711 --> 02:23:01,950
but no one trains with each
other. Like, I don't know. I mean,

2389
02:23:02,370 --> 02:23:05,100
but then again in like
collegiate mean wrestling,

2390
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:10,170
like Minnesota and Iowa are bitter rivals.
They never,

2391
02:23:10,310 --> 02:23:13,620
you know, I would just, I
was their own little world.

2392
02:23:13,650 --> 02:23:17,730
They don't do anything with anyone.
They're just like feral cats.

2393
02:23:17,731 --> 02:23:19,770
They don't mess with anything.
Also in another place,

2394
02:23:19,771 --> 02:23:21,780
like we were talking about Boston,
about Boston,

2395
02:23:22,040 --> 02:23:25,180
the women aren't the best look and
it's cold as shit. Everybody's anger.

2396
02:23:25,181 --> 02:23:29,660
Nobody wants a fight. That's nothing
compared to Iowa. You know, people would,

2397
02:23:29,661 --> 02:23:34,200
I would, would vacation in Boston and
change and go, this place is amazing.

2398
02:23:36,090 --> 02:23:41,040
Everyone's hot. Look at all
the teeth payback. It hit
you. I hope you're listening.

2399
02:23:41,360 --> 02:23:42,870
Just the fact,
I'm sorry,

2400
02:23:42,950 --> 02:23:47,010
but the plus side is I would create
some of the toughest motherfuckers ever.

2401
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:52,080
I mean, not just a military camp and
one of the legendary camps of MMA,

2402
02:23:52,380 --> 02:23:57,120
but I mean, how many top end they grow.
Giant fucking deer down there. Holy Shit.

2403
02:23:57,121 --> 02:24:00,700
Some of the biggest deer you ever seen
your life. I got to give a quick thinks.

2404
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:04,530
Um, Pat Miletich, she's been a
big part of my development in MMA.

2405
02:24:04,990 --> 02:24:07,250
He really took me under
his wing are come down.

2406
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:10,440
We used to bring a lot of our
guys to cross train together. Um,

2407
02:24:10,540 --> 02:24:14,520
Pat's a dear friend of mine and I love
the way he calls fights. Yes, I do too.

2408
02:24:14,890 --> 02:24:16,830
He's like you and I,
he,

2409
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:21,780
he's telling all those little extra
details that people want. It's a punch.

2410
02:24:21,790 --> 02:24:26,760
A kick. No, the what? The, when the where,
the why, the how and no nonsense too.

2411
02:24:26,761 --> 02:24:28,890
I liked his no nonsense
approach to commentary.

2412
02:24:28,891 --> 02:24:31,470
He'll tell you when a guy's in trouble.
Like he's in trouble.

2413
02:24:31,471 --> 02:24:34,680
He's losing this guy. This guy's got to
get busy. He's got to go do something.

2414
02:24:34,980 --> 02:24:37,560
He doesn't take a safe
path. He doesn't, you know,

2415
02:24:37,561 --> 02:24:39,990
he doesn't sit on the sidelines
and just sort of call the action.

2416
02:24:40,230 --> 02:24:43,170
He'll tell you what a guy has to
do with this. Guys got to get busy.

2417
02:24:43,170 --> 02:24:45,510
He's got to do this. If he doesn't do
this, you're gonna lose this fight.

2418
02:24:45,690 --> 02:24:49,920
Now pad actually was one of
the first innovators of true
MMA, mixed martial arts.

2419
02:24:50,250 --> 02:24:54,450
Wrestling, striking. It's good at
grappling was a bad mother fucker.

2420
02:24:55,290 --> 02:24:59,190
Dude was a bad motherfucker,
dude. I took no, no.

2421
02:24:59,191 --> 02:25:02,340
What I did when I wanted to find
out what Anthony Pettis was made of,

2422
02:25:02,790 --> 02:25:07,790
I took Cayman Sergio down to probably
circa oh seven are probably oh seven oh

2423
02:25:11,461 --> 02:25:12,840
eight oh seven.

2424
02:25:13,380 --> 02:25:17,010
So I took him down there
and pat random through the,

2425
02:25:17,430 --> 02:25:22,120
he sparked with both surgeon and
you know, Oh yeah, no, you know,

2426
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:23,890
you know, it was cool. Is

2427
02:25:24,670 --> 02:25:29,650
I, that was before I built my camp. That
was the testing ground. You got to go, uh,

2428
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:34,210
that practice room. Oh my
God. But the practice room,

2429
02:25:34,630 --> 02:25:37,940
the way they did it back then as
opposed to weigh and intelligent camp,

2430
02:25:38,410 --> 02:25:41,440
they didn't know any better. They
were, they were. Yeah, they were.

2431
02:25:41,441 --> 02:25:44,890
And they were the innovators of the
MMA camp. They were the original,

2432
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:47,020
you know what they call
themselves? The Black Legion. Yeah.

2433
02:25:47,070 --> 02:25:51,640
It was based on the Croatian
Black Legion. Nah, man. I mean,

2434
02:25:51,641 --> 02:25:55,450
I've seen guys get knocked out.
They drag him off the man. Hey Pat,

2435
02:25:55,451 --> 02:25:58,140
what's going on today? Has a lot of guys
are going, I've got to thin the herd.

2436
02:25:58,141 --> 02:26:00,990
Duke. Yeah. Okay. You,

2437
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:05,650
I mean it's a, but I
mean, I was there with,

2438
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:10,640
you know, there's Tim Silvia
Rothwell says Malevich Rory, mark,

2439
02:26:10,641 --> 02:26:15,190
um, uh, Jens, the dentist,

2440
02:26:15,191 --> 02:26:17,200
Josh Neer,
um,

2441
02:26:17,940 --> 02:26:22,940
McGiver in just the list goes on of
all the different killers on the mat.

2442
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:26,620
And it was just fun. I mean, you know,

2443
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:29,710
they had this crazy dude,
Ackerman,

2444
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:35,040
he was a former wrestler with his legs
cut off and he had the craziest strength.

2445
02:26:36,401 --> 02:26:40,210
I grappled them.
He could do the weirdest submissions.

2446
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:45,420
He had like the shoulder of awkward stick
is halfway egg into my hip and lock my

2447
02:26:45,611 --> 02:26:48,370
shoulder. And it was like the most
painful submission I've ever been in.

2448
02:26:48,580 --> 02:26:53,500
Nicest guy. But he was, he, if his legs
were not cut off, he'd be super tall.

2449
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:55,450
One of the best rappers
I saw him actually,

2450
02:26:56,050 --> 02:26:59,290
he did a submission
tournament with red Shafer.

2451
02:26:59,590 --> 02:27:04,330
He was getting put in a north south and
he did it back to him from the bottom

2452
02:27:04,331 --> 02:27:08,740
and choke them unconscious. He
countered. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah.

2453
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:12,430
It was a really cool counter. How
did he do it? Like I want way, uh,

2454
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:16,540
I'd have to pull the video up somewhere,
but this guy just had crazy strength.

2455
02:27:16,750 --> 02:27:20,110
So the guy had north, south
on them are nowhere. Yeah.

2456
02:27:20,590 --> 02:27:24,730
And he had a counter to it is,
it is crazy.

2457
02:27:24,850 --> 02:27:27,620
I forgot what he caught
him with, but he just, he,

2458
02:27:27,670 --> 02:27:32,670
because of his unique strength and we'd
be warming up and he'd run on is for cut

2459
02:27:32,861 --> 02:27:37,840
off legs. Yeah. But just a great
guy. Great incredible grap word.

2460
02:27:37,870 --> 02:27:40,960
And he was a great wrestler too.
And because his legs are cut off,

2461
02:27:40,961 --> 02:27:44,130
he could fight it. A lighter weight
class. Oh my God. So he had the army?

2462
02:27:45,450 --> 02:27:49,710
Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Cool Times. And just, um,

2463
02:27:49,930 --> 02:27:53,290
some of the old school guys that
fought way back from the day,

2464
02:27:54,170 --> 02:27:56,860
I forgot the guy's name,
but he looked like Mr. Freeze.

2465
02:27:57,070 --> 02:28:01,940
I've never been grabbed harder by
one man. Just grins. Jeffrey's uh,

2466
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:05,230
what was his name? Uh, the
guy from, I forgot one of the,

2467
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:08,900
he fought in the old school,
UFC. He's a cop and, and uh,

2468
02:28:09,790 --> 02:28:14,110
I'm having a brain fart to look
like a white bald guy. Pretty big.

2469
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:18,370
Not Monson. No, no, no. He
only fought once or twice,

2470
02:28:18,371 --> 02:28:22,430
but definitely, I mean, padded the
history there. It was so cool. I mean,

2471
02:28:22,740 --> 02:28:26,090
and then he'd have Brazilians
visiting guys from all over the world,

2472
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:27,980
kind of what I'm doing now of it,
you know,

2473
02:28:28,310 --> 02:28:32,480
he had guys in what happened in military,
says gym just doesn't exist anymore.

2474
02:28:32,780 --> 02:28:37,250
It's there. I just think Pat's doing
a lot of military teaching and uh,

2475
02:28:37,650 --> 02:28:41,240
as well, he is doing his
color commentary and access.

2476
02:28:41,610 --> 02:28:46,140
He's really into his family, to his
girls. He growing up, I mean, uh,

2477
02:28:46,340 --> 02:28:51,140
and so he doesn't train fighters
and he helps out a little bit. Yeah.

2478
02:28:51,141 --> 02:28:54,380
I don't think it's something he wants
to do full time. It's not for everybody.

2479
02:28:54,381 --> 02:28:58,490
You know what I mean? You gotta
be, I mean, sometimes, you know,

2480
02:28:58,491 --> 02:29:02,660
he got her a bit of a ride, that emotional
wave, you know, I've had some times,

2481
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:05,250
you know,
that negative influences and uh,

2482
02:29:05,690 --> 02:29:10,070
your Jim and team where I'm almost ready
to give it up. Negative influences.

2483
02:29:10,071 --> 02:29:14,440
You mean like people in attitudes,
but I gotta tell you I'm,

2484
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:18,320
I'm the happiest I've ever been coaching
and teaching right now my whole life.

2485
02:29:18,321 --> 02:29:21,710
Like there's gotta be some indication
now you've got a world champion,

2486
02:29:21,740 --> 02:29:24,920
not just a world champion.
He hadn't belt or with aspirin,

2487
02:29:24,921 --> 02:29:29,840
but now you've got the big, you know,
the big one. I think that's cool,

2488
02:29:29,841 --> 02:29:33,500
but I'm going to tell you, Joe, Nora,
it's all about the people. You do it with,

2489
02:29:33,501 --> 02:29:37,520
the peep the faces you're there
with every day. You know? I mean,

2490
02:29:37,550 --> 02:29:38,930
that's what it's all about for me.

2491
02:29:39,890 --> 02:29:44,360
I would be doing this if I didn't have
champions and didn't have famous UFC and

2492
02:29:44,630 --> 02:29:47,990
guys on the high level. But
it's the feeling you, you know,

2493
02:29:48,350 --> 02:29:50,750
the feeling you have when you
walk into that place every day.

2494
02:29:50,990 --> 02:29:55,820
The people that look back
at you and that to me, I,

2495
02:29:56,240 --> 02:30:00,120
I can only do things that make me happy.
I unfortunately,

2496
02:30:00,770 --> 02:30:05,510
I'm not the guy who shuts up and we'll
do it just to do it right. Paycheck.

2497
02:30:05,511 --> 02:30:09,830
It's not me. And so that's
when I'm happiest. So that's
why you're so good at it.

2498
02:30:10,010 --> 02:30:10,600
Oh thank you.

2499
02:30:10,600 --> 02:30:13,700
You're so good at it because you have
so much passion for it because you throw

2500
02:30:13,701 --> 02:30:16,940
yourself into it cause you commit
to it 100% and because you're,

2501
02:30:16,941 --> 02:30:20,960
you're so deeply engrossed in the world
of MMA and kickboxing and you're just,

2502
02:30:21,410 --> 02:30:23,660
you're so mean. You're, you're
living in it all the time.

2503
02:30:23,661 --> 02:30:26,690
If you didn't work for glory,
you and I can have the same conversation.

2504
02:30:26,691 --> 02:30:30,890
Definitely. For sure. I mean I
can watch fights, talk fights,

2505
02:30:30,891 --> 02:30:34,700
like people come into the gym visit
and that like, holy crap. It's like,

2506
02:30:34,701 --> 02:30:38,600
what time I could keep
going and going. And God, I,

2507
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:43,520
this is again, getting back to
the team. I love the people.

2508
02:30:43,521 --> 02:30:47,060
My guys are, they're not saints.
Well trickles down. Yeah.

2509
02:30:47,061 --> 02:30:51,250
I just saw today are you set a great
example in that champion that train

2510
02:30:51,290 --> 02:30:54,220
training your gym before and it's a very,
very friendly environment.

2511
02:30:54,221 --> 02:30:58,250
It's really cool. Hard worker. Thank you.
Everybody's there to, to do their job.

2512
02:30:58,251 --> 02:31:00,350
Everybody's here to work hard,
but it's a very friendly,

2513
02:31:00,380 --> 02:31:04,820
like very family environment. Cool.
We tried to set up like the new place,

2514
02:31:04,821 --> 02:31:08,090
especially at like a clubhouse. So if
you're not training, you're hanging out.

2515
02:31:08,091 --> 02:31:13,010
We got the flat screens. I mean, um, you
know, everyone's going to watch the, uh,

2516
02:31:13,040 --> 02:31:17,390
free fights it and the world series
of fighting at the gym Saturday.

2517
02:31:17,391 --> 02:31:20,190
Like I wanted to create
a community like a real,

2518
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:24,970
again, that's kind of how Tang on was all
the guys lived at the gym and you know,

2519
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:29,250
fights around guys would watch one of the
guys fight on TV. It's just in general.

2520
02:31:29,251 --> 02:31:30,810
I mean,
I think that's what martial arts is.

2521
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:35,490
The dojo is a extension of the
community center. You know,

2522
02:31:36,030 --> 02:31:40,230
for me, I really like reaching out
because I have a lot of guys besides like,

2523
02:31:40,470 --> 02:31:44,130
you know, the pedis. His Dad was
shot or stabbed and killed. My,

2524
02:31:44,470 --> 02:31:47,400
my Guy Mike Biggie Rhodes, who fights
in UFC is fighting the New Zealand.

2525
02:31:47,430 --> 02:31:51,930
Great Kid, moved from Iowa, actually
his cousins, Mike Van Arsdale. And uh,

2526
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:55,200
he, uh, you know, he has
a tough story growing up.

2527
02:31:55,201 --> 02:31:59,370
His parents abandoned his grandmother,
you know, raised him. He went,

2528
02:31:59,430 --> 02:32:01,680
earned his degree in college
once he graduated from college,

2529
02:32:01,681 --> 02:32:05,830
moved up to Milwaukee when the RFA
title and then he's now in the UFC.

2530
02:32:05,860 --> 02:32:06,571
Live in the dream.

2531
02:32:06,571 --> 02:32:11,520
But what I love about him
is he's so positive about
the shit life he comes from.

2532
02:32:11,550 --> 02:32:14,760
He doesn't complain.
He's about the same with Anthony.

2533
02:32:14,761 --> 02:32:16,570
He don't cry about what it was.
It's,

2534
02:32:16,590 --> 02:32:20,970
he's focused on what he wants to become
and what he has because he's happy now

2535
02:32:20,971 --> 02:32:25,560
because he's overcome. Yeah.
And just, I mean, even my guy,

2536
02:32:25,561 --> 02:32:26,161
Rick Glenn,

2537
02:32:26,161 --> 02:32:30,300
his sisters dying of cancer and he had
to cancel out of the fight earlier this

2538
02:32:30,300 --> 02:32:31,490
year and he's struggling.

2539
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:34,890
He's going to win that belt Saturday
and he's going to dedicate it to sister

2540
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:39,120
who's, you know, been in
hospice struggling. And I, I,

2541
02:32:39,270 --> 02:32:42,990
I love the character and the strength of
the people I'm around. It's inspiring.

2542
02:32:42,991 --> 02:32:45,450
It makes me want to do more.

2543
02:32:45,451 --> 02:32:48,180
So when I say I want a
flight that's selfish,

2544
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:53,280
those guys make me not want to fight
and focus on them. Yeah. Cause man,

2545
02:32:53,281 --> 02:32:54,114
they're just,

2546
02:32:54,150 --> 02:32:59,150
I love people who dedicate to themselves.

2547
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:02,340
There's nothing worse than
watching people waste their money.

2548
02:33:02,420 --> 02:33:06,050
Pancho. It's cause the spike
game so hard, man. It's such a,

2549
02:33:06,500 --> 02:33:09,530
it's such a grind. Everything in
life. Yeah, you're right. You know,

2550
02:33:09,531 --> 02:33:13,670
even you probably know Comedians,
actors who just are self destruct.

2551
02:33:13,720 --> 02:33:16,790
I medians especially. Yeah,
it's the roller coaster, man.

2552
02:33:17,060 --> 02:33:20,210
It's so hard to watch
guys who have everything,

2553
02:33:20,300 --> 02:33:23,080
but they just won't talk
to be dedicated hard.

2554
02:33:23,270 --> 02:33:26,180
That's why a gym like yours is so
important to be around a bunch of other

2555
02:33:26,181 --> 02:33:27,920
dedicated people.
You inspire each other.

2556
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:31,880
I have a bunch of dedicated comedian
friends and I call upon them all the time

2557
02:33:31,881 --> 02:33:32,541
for inspiration.

2558
02:33:32,541 --> 02:33:36,410
We inspire each other and being around
guys that are constantly writing and

2559
02:33:36,411 --> 02:33:39,260
pushing and going for it,
it makes you want to do the same.

2560
02:33:39,470 --> 02:33:42,410
The same thing with training when you're
around guys that are training twice a

2561
02:33:42,411 --> 02:33:46,820
day and training hard and they're
really enthusiastic about it and pushing

2562
02:33:46,821 --> 02:33:51,380
everybody and going for it. It brings that
up in you. You want to do it yourself.

2563
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:54,750
Yeah, I love it. Like I don't have
to raise my voice too much anymore.

2564
02:33:54,751 --> 02:33:57,460
I love that because they know I won't.
I won't.

2565
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:59,940
I don't want to be a dick in the
practice room. I want to be cool.

2566
02:33:59,941 --> 02:34:04,140
I want to laugh if we're working hard,
you know, my pound sign is having fun,

2567
02:34:04,141 --> 02:34:08,490
getting it done. If we're doing work
hard but have fun, you know, it's cool.

2568
02:34:08,510 --> 02:34:10,510
I mean I got my other
guy Dustin or t's fight,

2569
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:13,050
tough fight and Scoggin so some of the,

2570
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:16,110
you gave me some tips for the
fight that thanks. You know,

2571
02:34:16,111 --> 02:34:20,720
some techniques with science has a very
interesting side to side stance and he's

2572
02:34:20,730 --> 02:34:23,860
very good wrestler too, which is a
real con weird combination with that.

2573
02:34:23,890 --> 02:34:28,600
That karate background. Big Fan of that
kid. No, no, I mean f flyweight division.

2574
02:34:28,601 --> 02:34:32,470
I don't care what you fans
are talking about. That is
a sick stack division. Wild,

2575
02:34:32,530 --> 02:34:34,930
wild, wild division.
You know, how will you,

2576
02:34:34,931 --> 02:34:37,290
I'm enjoying transitioning
into commentary. Do,

2577
02:34:37,291 --> 02:34:39,670
you're doing commentary now for glory,
you know,

2578
02:34:39,730 --> 02:34:44,020
and it's very nice to see high level
kickboxing on spike and I commend them for

2579
02:34:44,021 --> 02:34:46,600
putting it on.
I was so happy when Gloria got onto,

2580
02:34:46,820 --> 02:34:49,900
I was one of the first people tweeting
about it. I've watched every event.

2581
02:34:49,930 --> 02:34:53,160
I fucking love it. I'm a huge, huge
fan. What does it like doing the,

2582
02:34:53,161 --> 02:34:57,430
the commentary you enjoying that I'm,
I'm the biggest fan myself.

2583
02:34:57,580 --> 02:35:01,750
You know what I mean? I really am. That's
what come, it comes across. I think.

2584
02:35:01,870 --> 02:35:04,870
I love it.
I mean even before,

2585
02:35:04,871 --> 02:35:09,660
like I surprised myself that I became
a world champion and kickboxing. Like,

2586
02:35:10,030 --> 02:35:14,230
I just wanted to fight to
validate my coaching and I
just kept on winning fights.

2587
02:35:14,580 --> 02:35:17,770
I'm like, Oh, I guess I'm all right
at this. But at the end of the day,

2588
02:35:17,771 --> 02:35:19,650
I'm still the biggest fan. Like, I,

2589
02:35:20,410 --> 02:35:23,440
you're going to have to kick me out
of here today. I could just keep,

2590
02:35:23,470 --> 02:35:24,850
you want to look at more fights.

2591
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:29,980
Like I can watch it until the cows come
on with you, man. It's, it's, that's,

2592
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:30,460
you know,

2593
02:35:30,460 --> 02:35:34,750
that's why I don't watch
other sports because I think
we're in the coolest sport.

2594
02:35:34,870 --> 02:35:38,080
There's, you know what, the two oldest
sports on the planet are wrestling,

2595
02:35:39,010 --> 02:35:43,060
no fighting and runners. Oh, either run,

2596
02:35:43,180 --> 02:35:45,340
not the beef food or
running to get your food.

2597
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:48,700
Either fight not to be food or fight it.

2598
02:35:48,710 --> 02:35:53,290
They're the two most primal things you
can do. Especially fighting, I mean,

2599
02:35:53,830 --> 02:35:56,710
that's what this, uh, kind of kind of a,

2600
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:01,180
it's a Cicero quote or my arm. The best
protector of the sheep is the wolf.

2601
02:36:01,181 --> 02:36:05,800
I believe that some people
in there, wolves and some
people are sheep. You know,

2602
02:36:05,801 --> 02:36:09,640
people love fighting there. The wolves,
they're the protector. So, you know,

2603
02:36:10,420 --> 02:36:12,550
and it's kind of like training days to it,

2604
02:36:12,551 --> 02:36:14,410
talking about it takes
a wolf to catch a wolf.

2605
02:36:14,411 --> 02:36:17,710
But like fighting is dude,

2606
02:36:17,711 --> 02:36:21,520
it's the most primal thing.
I'm, I still miss that.

2607
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,690
That dude wants to kick my ass.
I got to kick his ass.

2608
02:36:26,650 --> 02:36:31,300
It's the most nerve wracking.
It's like, uh, all right.

2609
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:35,860
So I was a little experimental when I
was a child and teenager after I lost my

2610
02:36:35,861 --> 02:36:40,090
sister, I saw about 25 or
26 grateful dead concerts.

2611
02:36:40,870 --> 02:36:44,590
And I, I'll use this
analogy, I'd say that I'm

2612
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:50,560
fighting your first fight if you'd never
done it before. It's like taking acid.

2613
02:36:50,561 --> 02:36:52,360
Either find yourself or lose yourself.

2614
02:36:52,590 --> 02:36:56,440
I've seen people are the baddest
ass person on the planet.

2615
02:36:56,620 --> 02:36:58,870
They're the best fighter in the gym.

2616
02:36:58,930 --> 02:37:03,130
And they go to the fight and they just
melt like butter. They're just can't,

2617
02:37:04,050 --> 02:37:06,280
you know, it's like
they trip out, you know?

2618
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:09,610
And that's what I love about fighting.

2619
02:37:09,880 --> 02:37:14,770
You got to take who you are and that and
the the gym and you're a god in front

2620
02:37:14,771 --> 02:37:15,650
of people.

2621
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:19,130
And I'll do it in front of
20,000 people or in a local show,

2622
02:37:19,131 --> 02:37:23,600
do it in front of 2100 people.
It's still, I love that vortex,

2623
02:37:23,601 --> 02:37:28,310
that rush of proving grounds.
Yeah. Real, true. Proving ground.

2624
02:37:29,300 --> 02:37:32,480
An exposure of truth like nothing
else because that's what I think.

2625
02:37:32,481 --> 02:37:36,080
It's like I've seen so many people
lose themselves. Dude. All right.

2626
02:37:36,081 --> 02:37:38,690
Bring up being dwarfed by the mall.
Bring up this clip.

2627
02:37:38,840 --> 02:37:42,680
This is when I knew Anthony
Pettis was special. Um,

2628
02:37:44,260 --> 02:37:46,530
Anthony, all right, I'll
give you the fight. He,

2629
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:50,050
he gets his shoulder popped out and he
gets up and knock the dude out with a

2630
02:37:50,051 --> 02:37:54,370
head kick. Like, check this out.
And this is when I knew like,

2631
02:37:54,490 --> 02:37:58,660
and I have a lot of kids like
this who just have that thing. Um,

2632
02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:00,700
Anthony Pettis verse.

2633
02:38:04,530 --> 02:38:05,363
Yeah.

2634
02:38:06,140 --> 02:38:10,970
Dead Air. Mike Lamb, brick, l a m B, r, e,

2635
02:38:10,990 --> 02:38:14,840
c, h. T and this you'll see raw.

2636
02:38:14,870 --> 02:38:18,590
But you want to talk about how you find
yourself and lose yourself in life.

2637
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:23,450
This is one of those moments like,
and uh,

2638
02:38:23,780 --> 02:38:28,640
you know that, that's why I love that.
You know, whether it's, you go do it.

2639
02:38:28,641 --> 02:38:31,520
I do Jujitsu tournament wrestling match,
whatever man.

2640
02:38:31,521 --> 02:38:36,521
Like getting in a Mano a Mano situation
is until you've done one on one sports,

2641
02:38:38,751 --> 02:38:40,700
you just don't know what I'm
talking about. Here it is.

2642
02:38:40,701 --> 02:38:43,850
So how did he get his shoulder? Fuck.
They'll see it here in a second.

2643
02:38:44,450 --> 02:38:47,620
He's teeing off on it. Yeah. That's
old Anthony. That's that, that,

2644
02:38:47,621 --> 02:38:51,860
that's hood red ant just come out the
bell rings and that don't look like new

2645
02:38:51,861 --> 02:38:56,720
Anthony, right? Yeah. He's
throwing a wild share right there.

2646
02:38:57,350 --> 02:39:01,000
All came down. Yeah. Fuck
the shoulder up. Yeah.

2647
02:39:01,310 --> 02:39:05,720
So now how bad was the shoulder?
Fucked up. Wait till he stands up.

2648
02:39:06,150 --> 02:39:10,790
You're going to see something
just crazy. And uh, you know,

2649
02:39:10,830 --> 02:39:14,930
just what I do is I always
judge people on their potential,

2650
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:19,310
not a each performance.
And like when I saw this,

2651
02:39:19,311 --> 02:39:23,870
I knew that this kid had super
potential like hearing hip escape.

2652
02:39:23,930 --> 02:39:27,500
Yup.
Marking fines away.

2653
02:39:30,370 --> 02:39:33,250
See it dangling. Oh yeah.
It's fucked up. So watch this.

2654
02:39:33,251 --> 02:39:37,570
This is why this kid special.
All right moves.

2655
02:39:40,540 --> 02:39:43,420
Wow.
Oh,

2656
02:39:44,380 --> 02:39:46,900
switch off the front leg too, right? Yep.

2657
02:39:46,990 --> 02:39:51,760
So that's why when you find
yourself with a fucked up shoulder,

2658
02:39:51,810 --> 02:39:55,570
yeah. Didn't have out, didn't think about
quitting and show that again. Jamie,

2659
02:39:55,571 --> 02:39:59,710
Jesus Christ. You know what I mean? Wow.

2660
02:40:00,790 --> 02:40:05,560
Everyone thinks he's just this flashy
kid and deep shin. That's, yeah,

2661
02:40:05,561 --> 02:40:08,590
that's perfect. It's, that's
beautiful. Then you're going to be,

2662
02:40:08,650 --> 02:40:12,190
you can't celebrate his shoulders so bad.
Now what happened to his shoulder?

2663
02:40:12,191 --> 02:40:13,980
What did he want him doing?
It popped

2664
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:18,300
it out. That's why I hesitated.
He never gets injured in training.

2665
02:40:18,390 --> 02:40:20,340
It's in fights, man. Wow. You know,

2666
02:40:20,341 --> 02:40:23,730
and that shoulder was hurting him for
awhile and he had to go through it and he

2667
02:40:23,731 --> 02:40:27,900
got it fixed and here he is,
you know? Wow. Yeah, just crazy.

2668
02:40:27,901 --> 02:40:31,650
I mean like you just got that,
that thing that,

2669
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:36,870
that's what competing in the
ring, the octagon like, you know,

2670
02:40:36,930 --> 02:40:41,830
it's just, I love that. That's
what I missed. That we got to,

2671
02:40:42,830 --> 02:40:44,880
you know your mind.
Like when I'm in the locker room,

2672
02:40:44,881 --> 02:40:48,150
I don't care how bad ass your,
your mind's fucking with you.

2673
02:40:48,151 --> 02:40:52,380
It's like you're on a trip. You don't feel
so good today. You don't want to fight.

2674
02:40:52,820 --> 02:40:56,730
They got to be like, fuck
you, he, come on, let's go.

2675
02:40:57,450 --> 02:41:00,690
You know, like everyone has doubts
in your mind. That's the key.

2676
02:41:00,691 --> 02:41:04,530
You got to keep all those voices
out of your head. Like Ah, you know,

2677
02:41:04,531 --> 02:41:07,680
it looks kind of Arosha is,
you know, seriously man,

2678
02:41:07,681 --> 02:41:11,640
you're tripping out back there and
then you know, it's like you find it,

2679
02:41:11,641 --> 02:41:14,490
you get your hands taped and
you figure it out. But you know,

2680
02:41:14,510 --> 02:41:18,960
it's such a head trip. There's a
Mike Tyson used to talk about that.

2681
02:41:18,961 --> 02:41:23,490
There's a cool speech he has where he's
like, if I met before in the locker room,

2682
02:41:23,730 --> 02:41:28,320
I'm getting my gloved up, I'm pounding
the leather and, and I'm scared.

2683
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:33,090
He's been training for me and I go up
there. But then I walked to the ring,

2684
02:41:33,091 --> 02:41:36,150
I feel like a God.
And then when I walked to the ring,

2685
02:41:36,151 --> 02:41:40,170
I look at them and I don't take an, I
look for a Ci, a chink in his armor.

2686
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:43,390
You know, it's just, I love
that intense moment. I know

2687
02:41:43,930 --> 02:41:44,763
when you see it anymore.

2688
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:47,200
That's one of the reasons why fines are
so intense when you're watching them.

2689
02:41:47,201 --> 02:41:47,891
On television.

2690
02:41:47,891 --> 02:41:51,250
When you see Chris Weidman stepping there
against Anderson Silva and two weeks,

2691
02:41:51,430 --> 02:41:51,971
or excuse me,

2692
02:41:51,971 --> 02:41:55,750
against Leo Machida in two weeks and you
see those guys opposite each other on

2693
02:41:55,751 --> 02:41:56,710
the other side of the octagon.

2694
02:41:56,711 --> 02:42:00,910
You know those are the two best 185
pounders in the world and they're about to

2695
02:42:00,911 --> 02:42:04,450
go and the referee, whoever it
is, looks at him. Are you ready?

2696
02:42:04,480 --> 02:42:07,630
And it looks at the other one. Are you
ready? Like, Holy Shit. Here we go.

2697
02:42:07,670 --> 02:42:10,400
Well, I'll give you my perspective. Like
I just get these dudes who are like,

2698
02:42:10,440 --> 02:42:12,800
I could be the best fighter.
I'm great at street fighting.

2699
02:42:13,010 --> 02:42:16,700
So you're good at going, hey,
I'm going to hit you by surprise.

2700
02:42:17,030 --> 02:42:21,260
You want to know what takes to be
a real gangster? I don't like you.

2701
02:42:21,280 --> 02:42:24,020
I got to fight you. I'm fighting
for the world title. Guess what?

2702
02:42:24,021 --> 02:42:28,790
We got to go on press tours. So every
time I see you, my adrenaline spikes,

2703
02:42:29,450 --> 02:42:33,010
man. I hate fucking jober. What do I
got to be here with them? All right,

2704
02:42:33,380 --> 02:42:35,360
we've got another press conference.
Oh Shit.

2705
02:42:35,361 --> 02:42:38,980
We're in the same hotel room all week.
I keep running into this asshole.

2706
02:42:39,410 --> 02:42:43,400
So every time it's like, I got to think
about this guy more than anything. Oh,

2707
02:42:43,550 --> 02:42:46,860
we're at the way in the back and
I get to stand next to him. Oh No,

2708
02:42:46,861 --> 02:42:51,710
now we got to walk out. Now we've got
to stare each other down. Oh Shit.

2709
02:42:52,160 --> 02:42:56,900
And this is all you think about. Then
you walk out, you walk out first.

2710
02:42:56,901 --> 02:43:00,410
Now you got to hear his song you're in,
you're in the ring waiting for him,

2711
02:43:00,411 --> 02:43:04,910
and then you know how many times I'm the
high level you confront with each other

2712
02:43:05,210 --> 02:43:06,620
as I love about little shows.

2713
02:43:06,890 --> 02:43:09,500
You see the dude at the Wayne and
then you show up and kick his ass.

2714
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:11,860
There's nothing but on the big man.
Then

2715
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:15,610
you're constantly forced
to be with that dude.

2716
02:43:15,670 --> 02:43:19,360
And that's something that folks don't
take into account when they think about a

2717
02:43:19,361 --> 02:43:20,530
fight,
a championship fight,

2718
02:43:20,531 --> 02:43:23,710
the amount of press these guys do and
the amount of interviews they have to do

2719
02:43:23,711 --> 02:43:25,870
the same question that you have to
answer over and over and over again.

2720
02:43:26,140 --> 02:43:30,100
Morning radio shows, interviews with the
reporters. Had enough. Enough, enough,

2721
02:43:30,101 --> 02:43:34,010
enough. It's an added element.
Oh, stressful element. People
who can handle the, the,

2722
02:43:34,011 --> 02:43:38,710
the big, big light media. I
mean that, that, that's, you
know, that's a tough thing.

2723
02:43:38,860 --> 02:43:43,590
Gory. I mean, here you're the
fuck fucker Milkman, right?

2724
02:43:43,950 --> 02:43:46,840
You know, but the restaurants
small, the way we're, we're at,

2725
02:43:46,841 --> 02:43:49,940
there's not a lot of stuff
around there, so it's like, man,

2726
02:43:50,230 --> 02:43:54,470
I used to hate it in k one we take the
same bus to the fights. Wow. It, my,

2727
02:43:54,500 --> 02:43:57,780
my first time I fought in Japan,
they didn't have separate bathrooms.

2728
02:43:57,850 --> 02:43:59,830
My opponent was on the table next to me.

2729
02:44:00,310 --> 02:44:02,830
That's how it is in Thailand
at Lindt Bunny Stadium. Like,

2730
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:07,090
then you got to sit like in
a chair waiting to go right
next to the dude you're

2731
02:44:07,091 --> 02:44:11,530
going to scrap with. It's
just like the coliseum. Wow.
Walk out with your opponent.

2732
02:44:11,531 --> 02:44:13,330
It's a trip.
You know what I mean?

2733
02:44:13,331 --> 02:44:16,480
Like people don't understand the
head trip about fighting again.

2734
02:44:16,481 --> 02:44:19,390
That's why I say it's like taking
some Hallucis, the gins, it's,

2735
02:44:19,690 --> 02:44:22,870
he can trip out a little there.
You know, it's very distorted.

2736
02:44:22,871 --> 02:44:24,730
Very reality distorting.
Yeah man.

2737
02:44:24,731 --> 02:44:29,440
I've seen people crumble under those
situations. Like I've seen the toughest,

2738
02:44:29,441 --> 02:44:34,180
most athletic people who can handle
the psychological side of it.

2739
02:44:34,181 --> 02:44:38,230
And when a fighter loses
that's when things get cause
then you start to question

2740
02:44:38,260 --> 02:44:42,430
everything. Your camp, you start
questioning your conditioning program,

2741
02:44:42,431 --> 02:44:45,790
you start questioning how you're set up
and how you're setting your training up

2742
02:44:46,120 --> 02:44:48,760
as far as how much emphasis is
on this and how much is on that.

2743
02:44:48,760 --> 02:44:52,330
And maybe I need to do Jiu Jitsu coach
or maybe my striking coach doesn't

2744
02:44:52,331 --> 02:44:56,950
understand striking for MMA.
Maybe I need to move to Albuquerque.

2745
02:44:56,951 --> 02:45:00,760
Maybe I should live in Seattle
with Matt Hume or go to Montreal.

2746
02:45:00,761 --> 02:45:04,950
It for us a hobby. Yeah. I mean do you
mind starts fucking with you? Yeah,

2747
02:45:04,951 --> 02:45:09,340
I mean especially people if they've been
an Alpha male successful their whole

2748
02:45:09,341 --> 02:45:11,260
life.
My biggest advantage,

2749
02:45:11,261 --> 02:45:16,210
I've been an underdog my whole life so
I'm really good at like I'm like Henry

2750
02:45:16,210 --> 02:45:16,211
Hill,

2751
02:45:16,211 --> 02:45:20,410
I know that once like he
said and everyone's got to
take a beat and once in a

2752
02:45:20,411 --> 02:45:24,420
while. So I'm, I'm mentally
strong. Cause I know like meetings.

2753
02:45:24,460 --> 02:45:29,170
You know what it's like. Yeah. Whether
it's verbal, abusive, you know, physical,

2754
02:45:29,850 --> 02:45:32,080
the like people who've
never had the struggle.

2755
02:45:32,320 --> 02:45:34,500
Those are the people
that drop off the worst.

2756
02:45:34,501 --> 02:45:37,750
That's one of the reasons why those
guys who have brothers are so fucking

2757
02:45:37,751 --> 02:45:40,330
dangerous. You who's
had brothers? Jon Jones,

2758
02:45:40,331 --> 02:45:44,350
because Chris Weidman was beat up by
his brother his whole life and widens

2759
02:45:44,351 --> 02:45:47,470
brother, put him in the hospital, dropped
a metal plate on his head. Wow. Yeah.

2760
02:45:47,471 --> 02:45:50,140
I mean there's a lot of shit
with those guys. Matt Hughes,

2761
02:45:50,141 --> 02:45:54,040
he had a fucking Twitter, just as bad
ass as him. Another gorilla growing up,

2762
02:45:54,041 --> 02:45:54,910
beating the fuck out of it.

2763
02:45:54,911 --> 02:45:58,600
She decided not to fight so his brother
could be championed. It's that crazy.

2764
02:45:58,601 --> 02:46:01,270
I know. Or think about what his
brother could have been. Yeah,

2765
02:46:01,271 --> 02:46:03,610
it would probably cause his brother
was good at it. Very, very successful.

2766
02:46:03,611 --> 02:46:05,650
We fought once and he didn't eat.
Yeah.

2767
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:08,960
I mean you fought another organizations
too. I believe. I believe so.

2768
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:09,970
But other Marilla

2769
02:46:10,430 --> 02:46:14,540
huge. I mean, so again, that
mental side of this sport that's,

2770
02:46:14,690 --> 02:46:19,280
I know what I like to
do. My new, I run my, um,

2771
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:24,940
my older fighters are kind of like navy
seals and the base navy seals don't have

2772
02:46:25,221 --> 02:46:27,830
to wear the uniforms.
They don't have as much protocol.

2773
02:46:28,340 --> 02:46:32,180
But my newer fighters I put in
through my spartan training,

2774
02:46:32,840 --> 02:46:36,170
I try and see what you're made
of early on in your career.

2775
02:46:36,560 --> 02:46:40,250
If you have any aspirations, if you
can't get through the spartan stage,

2776
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:43,820
you're never going to get to the
top level. You know what I mean?

2777
02:46:43,910 --> 02:46:47,150
It's kind of what, what
difference. I'm just,

2778
02:46:47,650 --> 02:46:52,160
we're a little harder on them. And then
my pro guys, the pro guys are made guys,

2779
02:46:52,161 --> 02:46:53,750
man, they've been doing it, you know,

2780
02:46:53,790 --> 02:46:56,930
that's the difference the way you talk
to a high school football player as

2781
02:46:56,931 --> 02:47:01,580
opposed to a NFL work. You
know what I mean? And I'm
not, I don't do it to be mean.

2782
02:47:01,581 --> 02:47:03,620
I want to see what you're made of man.
Right.

2783
02:47:04,050 --> 02:47:07,550
If you break down cause the coach gotten
your ass or kind of a pussy, aren't you?

2784
02:47:07,780 --> 02:47:12,380
You know? Sorry, I wanted to make you
great. Yeah. Sorry. I want you to win,

2785
02:47:12,381 --> 02:47:14,950
so I don't want you to get
your face three arranged. Yeah.

2786
02:47:15,080 --> 02:47:17,870
Dealing with adversity
and have an all forms,

2787
02:47:17,880 --> 02:47:21,800
verbal adversity and if
you can calm yourself down
during those horrible moments

2788
02:47:21,801 --> 02:47:25,400
of Duke Roufus screaming at you. Yeah.
I mean that's not always, but I mean,

2789
02:47:25,490 --> 02:47:29,780
I just know my brothers
did. My, my brother Noah,

2790
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:34,340
I'll describe my, my sister died when
I was 15 and I, I found her dead.

2791
02:47:34,341 --> 02:47:36,140
She died of sids.
It was pretty tough.

2792
02:47:36,141 --> 02:47:38,540
It's probably why I didn't have
a kid for a long time, honestly.

2793
02:47:38,540 --> 02:47:40,520
That's told my wife and I,
you know,

2794
02:47:40,630 --> 02:47:44,180
later in life and it's is
pretty traumatic for me.

2795
02:47:44,530 --> 02:47:46,940
He used to say it's not
feel sorry for Duke,

2796
02:47:46,941 --> 02:47:49,850
it's just what I figured out
and I feel better now about it,

2797
02:47:49,851 --> 02:47:54,170
but I was 16 that I decided, hey, I've
been doing martial arts my whole life,

2798
02:47:54,171 --> 02:47:56,810
but I said, I want to be a fighter.
My brother was older than me.

2799
02:47:56,811 --> 02:48:01,810
He's 20 he's already world champ. And Rick
was a killer. The scene at a godfather.

2800
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,100
I remember when Michael Goes,
you know,

2801
02:48:04,280 --> 02:48:08,060
I want to be in the family business
and my brother's like Sania hothead,

2802
02:48:08,061 --> 02:48:11,780
like the same. The same for
you kid. Remember he goes,

2803
02:48:11,781 --> 02:48:14,540
you're used to shooting them from
far away. We kill him up close.

2804
02:48:14,541 --> 02:48:18,380
And my brother was kind of like scoffed
at me. Like, you want to be a fighter?

2805
02:48:18,680 --> 02:48:22,850
So I had to go through the Rick roof,
this indoctrination.

2806
02:48:23,480 --> 02:48:27,470
My brother man, he used to lay Beaton's
hounding me like you wouldn't believe.

2807
02:48:27,590 --> 02:48:32,390
Yeah, hit me with spin back wheel
kicks back then. I mean, that kid was,

2808
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:36,800
you know, dude, my brother is amazing,

2809
02:48:36,801 --> 02:48:40,220
especially in his game,
PK style kickboxing.

2810
02:48:40,610 --> 02:48:44,990
But I was like a rocky movie. I just
kinda kept coming back every day. I just,

2811
02:48:45,620 --> 02:48:49,790
I was so messed up, but I
just wanted it so bad. But

2812
02:48:51,320 --> 02:48:56,000
I'm not saying that bad.
I'm glad my brother did that
to me. He made me so hard.

2813
02:48:56,270 --> 02:48:58,760
He made me Bain, man. You know,

2814
02:48:59,990 --> 02:49:02,680
I was molded in the darkness as he said.
You know,

2815
02:49:02,690 --> 02:49:07,530
Remember Bane and the Batman movie, you,
you guys nearly choose the darkness. No,

2816
02:49:07,770 --> 02:49:08,190
I was

2817
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:11,280
molded in and I had,
I had to go to hell every day.

2818
02:49:11,670 --> 02:49:15,330
I used to box in the inner
city in Milwaukee, in the
Martin Luther King Center.

2819
02:49:15,630 --> 02:49:19,320
It was like they had seen at our member a
true romance. Is it whiteboard date? No,

2820
02:49:19,380 --> 02:49:23,100
I don't think so. You know,
my nickname was snowflake.

2821
02:49:23,410 --> 02:49:25,840
You know the only white guy
in the room, you know, is,

2822
02:49:25,841 --> 02:49:30,300
it's like years of oppression.
Just, you know, but it's cool.

2823
02:49:30,301 --> 02:49:35,301
I got my ghetto pass now I'm all like
everyone knows back home that I can throw,

2824
02:49:36,870 --> 02:49:39,000
you know. But that's
what made me, you know,

2825
02:49:39,001 --> 02:49:41,750
a lot of guys don't
want to go through that.

2826
02:49:41,820 --> 02:49:46,820
I'm so happy I had to do
it that way because it made
me so mentally tough that I

2827
02:49:47,131 --> 02:49:50,700
have gotten my ass kicked and had the,
that's a hardest thing in the world.

2828
02:49:51,090 --> 02:49:54,990
Get the crap kicked out of you and
then you have to go beat someone else.

2829
02:49:55,860 --> 02:50:00,090
You know it's dude. What's the worst
humiliating thing you can do in life?

2830
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:05,550
Get your ass kicked in for our, gotten
everybody, God and everybody. Yeah.

2831
02:50:05,551 --> 02:50:09,660
Some guys, they have one loss, one big
loss and they just never recovered.

2832
02:50:09,661 --> 02:50:12,660
They never the same again. Toughest
thing I had to do in my whole career.

2833
02:50:12,690 --> 02:50:16,710
I fought 2001 they needed
a quick replacement for um,

2834
02:50:16,830 --> 02:50:18,270
k one at the Blasio.

2835
02:50:18,271 --> 02:50:21,840
I took the flight like on three weeks
notice I had another fight plan.

2836
02:50:21,841 --> 02:50:24,720
I was just starting my major strength
and conditioning for a flight.

2837
02:50:24,990 --> 02:50:29,130
Seven weeks later, no, or
like 45 days after that one.

2838
02:50:29,370 --> 02:50:33,750
So the decent amount. So I've
just, but hey man, it's k one if I,

2839
02:50:33,751 --> 02:50:37,650
when I'm back in the super 16 to
go to Tokyo. So I come out there,

2840
02:50:37,651 --> 02:50:41,040
I threw down with Stefan, let
go. Um, it was a great fight.

2841
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:45,060
I think it's on youtube actually. We're,
we're, we're going in. I felt so great.

2842
02:50:45,061 --> 02:50:49,230
First round. I sit down on that
stool, boom in a wall and then man,

2843
02:50:49,231 --> 02:50:50,100
we're going at it.

2844
02:50:50,101 --> 02:50:54,360
We're going to eight drops him once in
the segment and then the second round I

2845
02:50:54,361 --> 02:50:57,120
go to opera cut and I
just reached too far.

2846
02:50:57,390 --> 02:51:00,890
I see that fricking opera
got common. It's like, it's,

2847
02:51:00,900 --> 02:51:05,060
that's a worst thing that can happen
in your life. See a counter. Oh fuck,

2848
02:51:05,220 --> 02:51:08,910
I get it with it. Next thing you
know, I'm looking up at the lights,

2849
02:51:09,450 --> 02:51:12,480
but the thing is,
I was suspended 45 days.

2850
02:51:12,481 --> 02:51:15,960
I think it was fight in 46 days later.
So I had to go fight.

2851
02:51:15,961 --> 02:51:18,780
That one's on youtube to me,
verse Pedro Fernandez.

2852
02:51:18,781 --> 02:51:23,620
He lost by stoppage and then 46
days later he fought again. Yeah.

2853
02:51:23,720 --> 02:51:27,090
It's against the guy who only his only,
um,

2854
02:51:27,150 --> 02:51:31,020
losses were to my brother and Marie
Smith coming into that fight. Wow.

2855
02:51:31,060 --> 02:51:35,400
So when you do that, I, that was the
toughest challenge in my career. Wow.

2856
02:51:35,490 --> 02:51:37,880
How much time do you wait
until you spar again? Uh,

2857
02:51:37,890 --> 02:51:40,860
I waited a good amount.

2858
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:45,000
I really didn't spar it all a
shadowbox pads, everything. Wow. Yeah.

2859
02:51:45,390 --> 02:51:48,420
Just to give your brain a arrest.
Yeah. That's so important. Yeah.

2860
02:51:48,630 --> 02:51:51,630
There's so many guys get knocked down and
training and then they go to the fight

2861
02:51:51,631 --> 02:51:54,540
and then they can clip by one shot and
there, but I know a couple of guys,

2862
02:51:54,541 --> 02:51:54,960
I won't,

2863
02:51:54,960 --> 02:51:58,920
I won't rat them out to the UFC that
have gotten knocked out and training and

2864
02:51:58,921 --> 02:52:03,210
still fight. And they told him, I'm like,
man, you can't do that. So yeah, I mean,

2865
02:52:03,660 --> 02:52:06,170
yeah, it was, that was the
toughest of my career. It was

2866
02:52:06,880 --> 02:52:09,340
because not only that,
but man,

2867
02:52:09,341 --> 02:52:14,020
I just got knocked out f out
like that takes a PCU away.

2868
02:52:14,021 --> 02:52:17,960
Like you think you're some
bad mofo, you know, like, Eh,

2869
02:52:18,320 --> 02:52:22,880
I home rink, I had gotten
stopped by someone since, uh,

2870
02:52:23,410 --> 02:52:25,330
Mike Bernardo and 96,

2871
02:52:25,390 --> 02:52:30,390
so I hadn't been stopped rock put on
my ass by anyone since like that point.

2872
02:52:30,941 --> 02:52:35,090
You know what I mean? So it's
years, you know, it, you know,

2873
02:52:35,110 --> 02:52:37,780
when you get dropped on your
ass and it takes the, you know,

2874
02:52:37,781 --> 02:52:42,070
it's like maverick and a in top
gun. Can you get a bag? You know?

2875
02:52:42,071 --> 02:52:45,690
But that was for me, the toughest
fight of my career. I ended up winning.

2876
02:52:45,720 --> 02:52:48,760
I stopped a guy in three rounds.
But you know,

2877
02:52:49,630 --> 02:52:54,490
that's the thing people don't realize.
And Golf and tennis, Yay. Loss Bro.

2878
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:59,200
You know. Yeah. You lost
a basketball game. When we
lose, it's, it's catastrophic

2879
02:52:59,240 --> 02:53:04,160
guy loses in an MMA fight or a
kickboxing fight or even a wrestling.

2880
02:53:04,161 --> 02:53:08,990
It's like someone just stole who you are.
Yeah, definitely part of your essence

2881
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:13,340
triangles. You and you're
like, he just owned you,

2882
02:53:13,780 --> 02:53:14,591
Ben Henderson.

2883
02:53:14,591 --> 02:53:19,120
You could see like not robbing it into
Ben Cause I like Ben respect them a lot,

2884
02:53:19,570 --> 02:53:22,870
you know. Um, he the great
performance, by the way, Ben Curry,

2885
02:53:22,990 --> 02:53:24,310
I told him personally at the time,

2886
02:53:24,310 --> 02:53:28,990
fight fight was fantastic. That's
so good enough. Yeah. No Dude,

2887
02:53:28,991 --> 02:53:32,700
he has the pedes factor. Anthony
creates his own little Frankenstein.

2888
02:53:32,710 --> 02:53:37,270
He's making this dude get better man. He
was like, he's coming back, got damaged,

2889
02:53:37,320 --> 02:53:41,530
stay down. Don't come back. I can't
wait to see that rematch shut up.

2890
02:53:42,820 --> 02:53:45,160
I know cause it's hard to
be the guy three times.

2891
02:53:46,630 --> 02:53:50,140
I always say that it was always hard to
beat someone, you know, sooner or later.

2892
02:53:50,141 --> 02:53:52,800
Like how mark has caught up to back.
Yo,

2893
02:53:54,100 --> 02:53:58,700
you know it,
you could see Ben just crushed.

2894
02:53:58,770 --> 02:53:59,380
Yeah.

2895
02:53:59,380 --> 02:54:01,180
That's the artist thing.
I respect them.

2896
02:54:01,181 --> 02:54:04,610
And that's the hardest thing about the
sport. You see your opponent. I'm glad.

2897
02:54:04,970 --> 02:54:09,970
Yeah. It drives me nuts when guys don't
tap in to get their arms snaps and then,

2898
02:54:09,971 --> 02:54:10,780
you know,
they're fucked.

2899
02:54:10,780 --> 02:54:15,040
Well Jon Jones lost his title or could
have lost his title to Vito Belfort,

2900
02:54:15,041 --> 02:54:16,450
but he decided not to tab.
Yeah.

2901
02:54:16,750 --> 02:54:19,930
And when Vito was cranking on that
arm and it was hyper extended,

2902
02:54:20,200 --> 02:54:23,650
John made a decision, a decision, I'm
going to let this song and get fucked up.

2903
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:25,570
And his arm was fucked up for a long time.

2904
02:54:25,571 --> 02:54:28,870
That's why he coached on the ultimate
fighter with jail because he really

2905
02:54:28,871 --> 02:54:32,530
couldn't train her fight. So
He's like, just coach. You
know, what's the worst time,

2906
02:54:32,830 --> 02:54:37,630
worst lock break you've seen? Is it
Maghera or Tim Silvia? Yeah. That'll know.

2907
02:54:37,631 --> 02:54:42,240
Gary is just as bad, if not worse. Maybe
no. Garris worse. Cause it was no, Gary,

2908
02:54:42,241 --> 02:54:43,720
I remember my boy Danny downs.

2909
02:54:43,780 --> 02:54:48,760
I can't believe member when the Kimora he
got put in. Yeah. That kid is so tough.

2910
02:54:48,810 --> 02:54:53,640
Yeah. Amazing. Yeah. He's
actually coaching in San
Diego at a victory and remain,

2911
02:54:53,650 --> 02:54:57,820
he writes for the UFC. Oh,
beautiful. Yeah, he's got some
funny stuff, man. He's cool.

2912
02:54:58,030 --> 02:55:00,770
But that's one tough
Irish kid. I just, yeah,

2913
02:55:01,020 --> 02:55:04,130
I couldn't believe like
he just, you know, again,

2914
02:55:05,420 --> 02:55:09,560
sometimes guys don't do as well
as they'd like to do in the UFC,

2915
02:55:09,561 --> 02:55:12,380
but I'll tell you one thing
about that kid heart courage.

2916
02:55:12,650 --> 02:55:14,270
He went out on a shield.
You know,

2917
02:55:14,271 --> 02:55:17,420
sometimes as an athlete
you're the hammer or the nail.

2918
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:22,190
Your job is to entertain the fans.
And the kid came out to fight every time.

2919
02:55:22,640 --> 02:55:25,910
He was very fun to watch, very fun
to watch as all your guys are you,

2920
02:55:25,911 --> 02:55:28,790
you produce really exciting
fighters or tried to, I mean, uh,

2921
02:55:28,910 --> 02:55:33,650
something I learned years ago from
growing up, my dad was a promoter.

2922
02:55:33,950 --> 02:55:36,470
You know, you want to be a
promoter's delight. You know,

2923
02:55:36,471 --> 02:55:40,010
you want to be the guy that, hey, we got
to get these guys on there. You know,

2924
02:55:40,011 --> 02:55:44,030
it's fun. You know what I
mean? To Sergio's credit,
he tried to finish a fight.

2925
02:55:44,031 --> 02:55:47,360
He was winning against Bruce Lee
Roy and he dropped first submission,

2926
02:55:47,361 --> 02:55:51,560
made a tactical area wanting to finish
with a heel hook personally where I got

2927
02:55:51,561 --> 02:55:55,130
them. You know, I'm a big fan of Bruce
Lee. Right? I think he's underrated.

2928
02:55:55,550 --> 02:55:59,330
I think he's a very, versus Uriah.
Interesting. I mean it's just,

2929
02:56:00,390 --> 02:56:04,520
you know, he's tough fight. Yeah. Tough
fight. I mean your eye is a veteran.

2930
02:56:04,521 --> 02:56:06,770
I mean if he does what
he did to Mcdonald's,

2931
02:56:06,771 --> 02:56:09,960
just runs out and makes the street fight,
throws him on the ground vintage.

2932
02:56:10,010 --> 02:56:14,240
That's what I like seeing Uriah do.
I W I think derives doing good striking,

2933
02:56:14,480 --> 02:56:17,930
but I think when he comes out,
you're right cave man. Yeah.

2934
02:56:18,970 --> 02:56:23,970
Alan just chokes people out is that he's
kind of a a blueprint for what I want

2935
02:56:24,231 --> 02:56:28,220
to see a lot of my wrestlers do. Go
Punch him, take him down, throw him down,

2936
02:56:28,340 --> 02:56:29,720
choke him out and let's go home.

2937
02:56:30,140 --> 02:56:33,650
Fight was probably his finest performance
in the icon. That was spectacular.

2938
02:56:33,890 --> 02:56:38,120
I think older fighters, like he kind of
reminds me a little of Oscar de la Hoya,

2939
02:56:38,760 --> 02:56:42,590
like Oscar switched training with,
with Mayweather's dad.

2940
02:56:42,830 --> 02:56:45,800
And you get bored with
certain styles or like you,

2941
02:56:45,801 --> 02:56:47,930
you put weapons in your arsenal,

2942
02:56:48,140 --> 02:56:51,590
but sometimes learning new weapons
actually hurts you more than helps you.

2943
02:56:52,070 --> 02:56:54,550
You know what I mean? Cause it
gets you confused. Cause yeah,

2944
02:56:54,551 --> 02:56:59,330
he led are almost too much. I used
to do that. I, I, I'd be like, man,

2945
02:56:59,331 --> 02:57:02,570
I'm really into this technique but it's
not helping me. It's actually hurting me.

2946
02:57:02,690 --> 02:57:06,620
We're running out of time. We've just
