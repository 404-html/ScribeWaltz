1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
I'm in a rush today.
Yes,

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:03,780
we live.
Gentlemen,

3
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:05,850
welcome back.
What's up Joe?

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,380
So I watched a documentary last night.
Holy Shit.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,330
You Holy Shit.
Had me twice already.

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,370
Really Holy Shit at me with bigger,
stronger,

7
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:16,650
faster,
and now your holy shit at me with a

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,610
prescription.
Thugs.

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,540
It's kind of crazy,
right?

10
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:22,170
We have a $300,000,000,000 prescription
drug habit in this country,

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,140
yet we rank number 50 in life
expectancy.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,550
It makes no sense.
Well,

13
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,120
it all came down to Ronald Reagan.
That's what's really crazy.

14
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:34,620
When they allowed people to allow
pharmaceutical companies to advertise on

15
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:37,350
television.
I can remember when those things first

16
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:38,600
started showing up.
Well,

17
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:38,940
it's,
well,

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,730
medicine turned into a business and when
it turned to a business that wasn't a

19
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:45,150
very good thing for the consumer.
No at all.

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,050
No,
it's terrible.

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,080
How much further do you think life
expectancy has changed over the last

22
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,740
hundred years?

23
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,770
A well over the last hundred years I
think it's changed dramatically,

24
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:58,800
but I think the last 50 years probably
not so much.

25
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:00,120
I mean,
from what I've seen,

26
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:02,310
it's about 20 years.
Not that much.

27
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,770
Well,
how much would you think it would be?

28
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,090
I don't know.
I just think it'd be more,

29
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:08,010
I don't know.
You hear about a modern medicine just

30
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:10,740
being such a big thing and it being able
to help you and.

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,090
But we also have a tainted food supply,
which we're talking about a little bit

32
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,680
that that's really hard to get healthy,
to be healthy.

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,220
Totally healthy.
Well,

34
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,480
it requires effort for sure.
It definitely requires you to pay

35
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,090
attention.
It definitely requires you to watch what

36
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:26,130
you eat and most people don't want to do
that.

37
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,850
But what's stunning to me,
I mean there was a lot of stunning

38
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:34,740
things in that documentary,
but the sheer numbers of prescription

39
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:37,500
pain pills that are prescribed in this
country every year,

40
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,090
that's staggering.

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,430
They said,
what was the actual quote that there was

42
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:46,431
enough pain pills to get every single
adult human in this country high for a

43
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,860
month,
for a month around the clock for a month

44
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,560
turned everybody zombies.
How fucking insane is that?

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,120
Kinda what we're doing.
I mean,

46
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:57,030
a lot of people are just walking around,
checked out and um,

47
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,950
you know,
one thing that I didn't know when I was

48
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,010
when I was addicted to painkillers was
actually ivy to Ibuprofen and Tylenol

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,670
has been clinically proven to be like
twice as effective as opiate

50
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:12,360
painkillers.
But if a doctor told me as a patient to

51
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:15,090
take Ibuprofen and tylenol together,
have like,

52
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:16,080
you're out of your mind,
give me the,

53
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,240
give me the good stuff that you wouldn't
feel he's doing enough for you.

54
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:20,400
Right.
I think that's a mentality that we have

55
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,420
and it's mentality that like I totally
admit to his family,

56
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,560
to a doctor I want,
I want to get a prescription,

57
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,300
but now I've changed that mentality.

58
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,870
But that's the mentality I did have.
Even if you go to a doctor and they give

59
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:33,990
you prescription Ibuprofen,
they give you 800 milligrams.

60
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,450
So two is four,
right?

61
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:40,650
It's 400 milligrams for two Ibuprofen
and then two tylenol,

62
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,430
which I don't know what the milligrams
of Tylenol is.

63
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,330
I don't usually take that,
but I have arthritis really bad.

64
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,150
My knees,
I had my hips replaced at 33 years old.

65
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,830
My ankles hurt everyday.
Everything and the advil and tylenol

66
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:55,560
combination has been knocking it out of
the park for me.

67
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:58,260
It actually learned that from doing
press for this movie.

68
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,950
I learned that from Dr drew of all
people.

69
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,963
Really?
Yeah.

70
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,220
That's incredible.
And how long you've been doing that?

71
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:04,940
Like two,
two advil in two Ibuprofen,

72
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,180
two months about.
And it makes a big difference.

73
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,210
It just helps me get through the day.
Helps me be pain free,

74
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,020
you know.

75
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,420
The other thing that a lot of people
talk about that I think just definitely

76
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:17,380
needs to be talked about is medical
marijuana because I'm an addict and I've

77
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:19,420
been through Rehab and everything.
I don't personally use it,

78
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:23,320
but I think for people that don't have a
problem with consuming everything,

79
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,100
I think it can be great.
So you have a problem too in the sense

80
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:29,890
that like even marijuana,
something that's not physically

81
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:31,840
addictive.
Once you start smoking that you'll want

82
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:33,040
other things.
And I'm only.

83
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,430
I've only been,
been sober about 22 months so I just

84
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:40,420
feel like I'm not ready to really take
that dive because I might smoke some

85
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,940
weed and then ended up,
you know,

86
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,790
taking some pills and drinking and
jumping in the pool naked and going to

87
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,624
jail.
You know,

88
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,280
what if you just get naked for jumping
in the pool naked if you get arrested

89
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:51,620
for that.

90
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,740
But that wouldn't be the end of it.
I would keep going.

91
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,780
He and I were talking the other day a
little bit about like,

92
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,970
you know,
everybody wants to justify their drug of

93
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,170
choice.
You know,

94
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:02,350
obviously I've been on performance
enhancing drugs for a long time and so

95
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:04,960
everybody wants to justify,
oh it's not addicting or it's not this

96
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:06,610
or not that.
It is addicting.

97
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:10,250
Any behavior that you practice over and
over again is going to become addicted

98
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,800
and like the side effects to it,
you know,

99
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,930
like some of the field to it.
So everybody,

100
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:16,690
I think a lot of times kind of kidding
themselves and they're saying,

101
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,950
oh,
pot doesn't do anything.

102
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:18,784
Or you know,
it's like,

103
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,210
it's like,
well it does something.

104
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,480
It doesn't make you function the best
probably,

105
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:24,640
you know,
it certainly can be psychologically

106
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,960
addictive.
Certainly.

107
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,621
I mean,
it,

108
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:28,930
it,
it helps her functioning in some ways.

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,250
That's one of the things that people
have gotten mad at me for a fucking bad

110
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,630
ass at video games,
that's for sure.

111
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,880
What else you at pool for sure helps of
music.

112
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:37,714
Like honestly,
I,

113
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,570
they're like God put everything if you
believe in God or whatever,

114
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,070
but we have a system like everything is
put on this earth for a reason and if,

115
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,630
you know,
they always say let medicine hypocrisy

116
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,010
said like let medicine be thy cure and
the cure be medicine,

117
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,970
food be medicine or whatever.
So like food as medicine is something

118
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:56,920
that tracy is like way back,
you know,

119
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,040
so things that are found on the earth
that we can use rather than

120
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,950
synthetically make.
And I think it just makes logical sense.

121
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,410
Well,
yeah.

122
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,390
Well it definitely is.
Probably a smarter way to do it is

123
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,900
healthy.
His name is hypocrisy,

124
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:09,470
right?
Isn't that awkward?

125
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,040
So
awkward.

126
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,690
You're onto something eponymous one of
them old dead Greek motherfuckers.

127
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,860
Yeah,
but the,

128
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,680
the,
the sheer numbers of oxycontins and pain

129
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,300
pills that are being prescribed in this
country.

130
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,090
It's a,
I was watching this television show

131
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,120
where they were talking about
Massachusetts and the problem.

132
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,260
Oh,
it was Anthony Bourdain show.

133
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:37,000
That's what it was.
And they were talking about all these

134
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:41,380
people that got hooked on pain pills
because they're good injured from some

135
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,220
job related or something,
or another doctor gives you a oxy

136
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:48,130
prescription,
your oxygen prescription runs out or

137
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:50,920
they changed the regulations and then
everybody turns to heroin.

138
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,210
And that's a big problem in this country
where they've changed the regulations.

139
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,160
Um,
and there was another that you talked

140
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:01,640
about on your,
on your documentary where they changed

141
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:06,500
the way Oxycontin's work or you can't
crush them up and smoke them anymore and

142
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,750
they lost 80 percent of their revenue
from that.

143
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,470
Yeah,
absolutely.

144
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,590
And that's something that just shows you
that people are using them

145
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:14,930
recreationally.
And how insane is that?

146
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:16,670
Yeah.
So that was one of the most staggering

147
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:20,360
facts of the whole movie I thought.
But we just came back from the Arnold

148
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:23,540
classic and we know there's some guys
dead lifting.

149
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,980
We went to this pro deadlift event and
these guys are pulling seven,

150
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,870
800 pounds.
One guy was kind of in an almost a 900

151
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:32,740
pound range,
but he ran into somebody backstage at

152
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:35,840
said he just,
he just saw the film and he lost his son

153
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:36,920
to what?
Heroin,

154
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:38,660
right.
It started as oxycotton.

155
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,550
It went to heroin where you go.
And he told me,

156
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:41,241
he said,
you know,

157
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:43,280
I wasn't gonna,
I wasn't gonna lift anymore.

158
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,640
I just gave up on everything.
I saw your movie like a couple months

159
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,451
ago.
And I said,

160
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:48,530
you know what,
I'm going to go,

161
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:50,270
I'm going to go dead lift at this
program thing.

162
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,680
And he said,
you're a movie.

163
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,900
Made it possible for me to get over what
happened to my son to realize like,

164
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:58,250
it wasn't so much his fault.
Right as he thought.

165
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,480
And so,
um,

166
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,690
I think just stuff like that,
like he told me that I was completely

167
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:03,910
fine talking to the guy.
I walked away,

168
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,580
just started bawling because I know that
you can even affect one person and

169
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:09,830
that's the power of film and
documentaries.

170
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:11,210
That's,
that's what we're trying to do.

171
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,830
Well in.
That guy's on the right track because he

172
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:17,150
said that now I feel it's my duty to
help other people and I think that's the

173
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:19,670
way people need to try to look at stuff
is to try to,

174
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:20,211
you know,
we're,

175
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:24,620
we're here as human beings to learn from
experiences and then I think we're all

176
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:28,010
put here to help each other.
Well can definitely help.

177
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,550
I mean for someone like that to reach
out and find other people who have also

178
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:36,320
lost people and you can help each other
and you can also maybe help someone who

179
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:41,321
is maybe thinking or would go down that
path and watches your documentary and

180
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:41,960
says,
well,

181
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,410
there's a real danger here.
Yeah.

182
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,470
The place that I went to cliffside
Malibu.

183
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,120
I have three people or three people
right now that are in Rehab there that

184
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:54,080
have contacted me from watching the film
and it's really hard to get into a lot

185
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:55,640
of rehabs because of insurance
companies.

186
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,830
And that's it,
that's another huge problem in this

187
00:07:57,831 --> 00:07:59,920
country is the insurance companies don't
they want to pay for.

188
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,090
They expect somebody to be smoking,
drinking,

189
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:05,270
doing whatever for 30 years and on wine
that in 15 days.

190
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:06,530
And that's just not gonna happen.
You know,

191
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,210
people need 90 days of treatment.

192
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,080
If you're going to go to a drug rehab,
you need 90 days and so you need 90 days

193
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:15,500
where you're not working 90 days where
you're just staying in this place.

194
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,970
Why?
Why is it 90 days?

195
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,910
Think about this.
You're working right and you're a drug

196
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:22,490
addict.
What productive work are you doing?

197
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,250
Like let the guy go for 90 days,
he's going to come back a new person.

198
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,900
I think that that,
that we have to,

199
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,680
we have to unplug.
There's,

200
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,160
there's no other way.
I mean,

201
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,420
I think that it just leads to an early
death,

202
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:33,254
you know,
if we don't,

203
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,260
that's so hard for people to have work
that they need to get money now you can

204
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:39,710
get,
you can,

205
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,660
you can get out a little bit,
right?

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,130
Like wait,
like you did,

207
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:43,551
right?
Yeah,

208
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:44,031
yeah,
exactly.

209
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,160
I actually made this movie while I was
still in Rehab,

210
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:49,490
so there's definitely time to do things.
I think that,

211
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:50,930
um,
you know,

212
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,310
you've got to look at it this way.
Like,

213
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,050
okay,
I can like almost like killing people

214
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:55,390
find inside jail.
Yeah.

215
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,010
That's

216
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,843
pretty talented.
Take.

217
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,950
I can't take 90 days to like just
completely like fix my life,

218
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,660
you know,
I think I dunno.

219
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,510
I think time is more important to get to
give the time.

220
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:10,320
And you need like a full 60 though where
you're pretty much total isolation right

221
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,460
through the first 30 days or actually
lives pretty much totally kind of

222
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,450
unplugged from everybody.

223
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,490
You just stayed up there.
And what,

224
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,610
what do you do with your time?

225
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,710
You're in a lot of meetings,
you know,

226
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,140
it's all like peer groups,
you know,

227
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,990
you're basically like with other people
that are addicted to drugs.

228
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,890
And I would say like probably 80 percent
of the people that were in rehab or

229
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:29,724
prescription drug.

230
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,980
Do you know what one of the most
effective methods of stopping people

231
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:38,981
from doing drugs is Ibogaine.
It's a psychedelic ritual drug that they

232
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:41,500
do.
You can,

233
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,100
you can't do it in America,
it's illegal,

234
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:45,980
but they have clinics in Mexico.
My Buddy ed clay,

235
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,900
he got hooked on pills and he had a real
problem with same thing,

236
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,560
pain pills and was really despondent and
fucked up.

237
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,080
Went down there,
did a,

238
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:02,170
an Ibogaine ceremony and uh,
came back 100 percent clean and now he

239
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:05,360
runs a clinic down there.
Any idea what that does for you?

240
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,720
Like do something your brain,
we could google it,

241
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,270
but there's some sort of an effect that
it does.

242
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:16,271
We're literally shuts down addiction and
it's deeply troublingly introspective

243
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:19,520
too.
Like it explores the dark

244
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,780
site.
They're fucking crazy.

245
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,890
I don't know anything about it.
I'm hearing it for the first time,

246
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,560
but address from one,
this is the first time you've heard of

247
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,030
Ibogaine.
Haven't haven't really ventured into

248
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:31,940
that and to figuring that out.
But um,

249
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,860
wow.
I'd never heard of it.

250
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,900
You know,
that's the crazy thing about doing these

251
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,820
documentaries,
like you're going to meet other

252
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:40,790
interesting people like yourself and you
pick up more knowledge now.

253
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,780
That's something I was like,
okay,

254
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:42,640
well what is this,
you know,

255
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:43,850
and go look into that.
So,

256
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,970
but what you're saying makes a lot of
sense because it all,

257
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,060
it's all in the brain.
You create these pathways in your brain

258
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,150
that just basically you habituate and
you do the same thing that you like and

259
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:57,070
it's the same thing with lifting weights
or doing Jujitsu or do you tend to that?

260
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,400
That feels really good.
I like it.

261
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,740
I'm going to go to Jujitsu again,
I'm going to go to the gym again,

262
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:03,010
you know,
so it definitely makes sense that it's

263
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,570
something that will trigger some

264
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,830
than in the brain to fix it.
You know?

265
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,330
It also,
apparently I haven't done Ibogaine,

266
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,890
but the people that I know that have had
problems with pills and gone down there

267
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:13,810
and done it,
and also people that have also had other

268
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:15,970
problematic behavior that they wanted to
correct.

269
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,930
It allows you to look at yourself
literally for the first time in like a

270
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,920
deeply introspective of almost
abrasively way.

271
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,220
Not,
not almost,

272
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,510
but very abrasively in,
in,

273
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:32,000
in that it looks at every aspect of your
person

274
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,900
and that's part of Rehab.
You have to be honest with yourself.

275
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,610
If you're not honest with yourself,
you'll never get better.

276
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,581
No,
I'm sure.

277
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:42,750
I'm sure people that are bullshit and in
line and that's why one of the reasons

278
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:44,190
why it's so important to hit rock
bottom,

279
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:44,540
right?

280
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,170
Yeah.
I used to say I could stop any day.

281
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,910
My girlfriend said,
well stop.

282
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,511
And I said,
okay.

283
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:51,960
And I stopped for seven days and after
seven days I took pills and drank more

284
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,310
than I ever did in my entire building

285
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,880
up.
Yeah.

286
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,570
It was like,
yeah,

287
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,000
exactly.
I ended up in the hospital and my

288
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:00,040
girlfriend called my brother and he was
the one who was like,

289
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:00,970
Hey,
just get him here.

290
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,860
Like he was in Sacramento.
He said,

291
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:04,270
just get them here.
I actually just moved.

292
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,530
It was crazy just to get.
I got a random phone call in the middle

293
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,390
of the night.
I don't normally answer my phone all

294
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:11,740
that much.
Um,

295
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,090
and just,
you know,

296
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:14,980
I,
I just randomly picked it up for some

297
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:18,530
reason it was from a Philadelphia or
Pennsylvania right in the column there.

298
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,940
That's where she's from originally.
And she was just in a total panic.

299
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,670
I couldn't understand what she was even
talking about.

300
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:26,530
I didn't even know who it was.
She was like,

301
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:27,700
this is lauren.
And I'm like,

302
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,541
well,
I don't know any chicks.

303
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,850
I'm married.
So I'm like,

304
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:31,311
you know,
I,

305
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:32,560
I don't,
I don't know who it is.

306
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,560
And then it took me a while.
Then I finally heard her say,

307
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,210
you know,
Chris's girlfriend,

308
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,200
and I was like,
Oh shit,

309
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:40,000
you know,
what the fuck is this?

310
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,010
Like the second call my losing another
brother,

311
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,980
what the fuck's going on here?
And then she started to calm down and

312
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:45,521
she said,
well,

313
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:47,980
don't know you're,
you lost both of you guys lost your

314
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:50,350
older brother to drug abuse,
right?

315
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,730
Yeah.
Mad Dog.

316
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,380
It had a lot of people say,
uh,

317
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,700
after they see bigger,
stronger,

318
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:57,160
faster,
which was the first film that featured

319
00:12:57,161 --> 00:13:00,790
my family and it,
everybody asks about mad dog because

320
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:04,210
everybody in that,
after watching that film worried about

321
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:06,310
him and a lot of concern,
they don't even know that he passed

322
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:09,760
away.
Some days you're fine handling it

323
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:13,300
because I feel like it's our obligation
to kind of talk about it to help other

324
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:15,850
people,
but sometimes you're just not ready for

325
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:17,620
the blind sides and it's just fucking
hurts.

326
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,140
Like a mother fucker.
This week at the Arnold Classic,

327
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:23,650
there was so many things that reminded
me of my brother because he grew up in

328
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:25,660
the wrestling,
bodybuilding at all.

329
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:27,910
Matt does that Shit.
He ain't eating that shit up.

330
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,793
And then.
And then.

331
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,750
And then his best friend Jeff lybolt
showed up at mark's booth.

332
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:35,080
Mark had a booth there selling all these
products and he shows up and it just

333
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,520
gives you like,
we love Jeff.

334
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:38,380
He's great,
but it gives you that feeling like,

335
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:40,060
man,
this was my brother's best friend and my

336
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:43,930
brother's not here to tugs,
tugs at your heart a little bit and it's

337
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:45,160
hard to talk to him about it,
you know,

338
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,440
if I bring up Mike's name,
uh,

339
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,570
you know,
Jeff gets upset and we don't know.

340
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,110
We just,
we will all wash.

341
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:54,850
I just trying to deal with this tragedy
and I was dealing with it in the wrong

342
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:55,030
way.

343
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,570
I was burying my feelings with drugs and
alcohol and his girlfriend saved his

344
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,880
life though.
She called me and she said,

345
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,230
you know,
I don't know what to do.

346
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:05,020
I don't know how I'm going to find them.
I'm outside his apartment now.

347
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:06,010
And I said,
well,

348
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,900
you're the only person there that he has
that's like,

349
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,340
you know,
that's kind of like family.

350
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,380
I was like,
you need to go inside the apartment,

351
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,230
make sure he doesn't have any keys and
just make sure he's alive,

352
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:15,190
you know,
checking on him.

353
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:18,130
So she did all that.
She made sure he was okay.

354
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:19,570
He was,
luckily he was okay,

355
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:22,220
but he was just passed out.
And uh,

356
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,310
then my wife and I came together and
just devise a plan to figure out how the

357
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:29,770
fuck do we get them to Sacramento,
you know,

358
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:30,551
how,
what are we going to do?

359
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,280
Like,
so we were talking about it and I was

360
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:35,020
like,
well if I just book a flight for him,

361
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:37,750
he's not going to fucking come.
Probably like tomorrow morning he's not

362
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,590
going to feel fine and be like,
all right,

363
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,360
got an 8:00 AM flight,
you know,

364
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,480
going through it.
I feel so fragile now.

365
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,990
Like I'm a completely different person
after going through that.

366
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:52,040
It humbles the shit out of you.
It

367
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,350
makes you just feel like,
like I feel really fragile.

368
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,140
I don't sometimes I don't know how to
deal with people or how to talk to

369
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:00,350
people because I'm just completely
different than I was before I went

370
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,420
through it.
So this is just in a couple of years?

371
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,810
About five years.
Yeah.

372
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,790
I've being on being on pills and
tractable when he felt invincible when I

373
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,030
was doing it.
And now I feel so vulnerable and I don't

374
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,400
know why that is,
but it's something that I think is

375
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,120
definitely a warning to anybody out
there that's thinking of getting on

376
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:20,890
prescription drugs or prescription drugs
pushed on them from their doctor.

377
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,900
Remember the advil and tylenol works
better than opiate painkillers and

378
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,600
people can look that up and you don't
walk away from it feeling like I feel

379
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,400
I know this guy who has a back injury
and he was always.

380
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,790
He always was weird.
I was always trying to figure out what,

381
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,960
what his deal was.
He always just seemed awkward,

382
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,240
awkward,
but socially like not like

383
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,970
inappropriate,
but like almost fearless,

384
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,390
like oblivious and clumsy.
And I was always like,

385
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:53,600
what the fuck is going on with this guy?
And we were trying to figure it out.

386
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:55,040
Like there's something,
there's something going on.

387
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,540
And then one day he goes,
hey,

388
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,620
um,
what's,

389
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,330
uh,
what's going on with this cryo therapy

390
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:01,000
thing?
Started asking me about cryotherapy.

391
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,911
I said,
well,

392
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:03,710
it's really good for reducing
inflammation.

393
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:07,400
Helps a lot with people with arthritis.
It's great for a,

394
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,490
it helps your body.
Rick kickstart.

395
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,290
It's a production of Collagen.
It's really good for a lot of things.

396
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,590
It's good.
I like it for the anti-inflammation

397
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,111
benefits,
like,

398
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:16,400
why would you,
uh,

399
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,740
what do you think am I said,
oh,

400
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:19,580
I got this back problem I've had for
years.

401
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,860
And then it clicked.
I go,

402
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:22,870
Oh,
you're on pills.

403
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,690
Pills all the time as a mother.
Because he would be like,

404
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:28,160
hey,
how are you guys doing?

405
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:29,750
What's going on over?
How's.

406
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,970
Everybody wasn't like that,
you know,

407
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,660
sometimes people are friendly,
but they're like,

408
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:37,130
are you okay with me being in front of
just like a little touch and go there,

409
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:39,490
figuring it out.
This guy was just falls

410
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,850
out loud.
He wasn't shit pilled up man.

411
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,253
It was,
um,

412
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,540
we were uh,
together with a bunch of other friends

413
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,950
that we know.
He was just,

414
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,270
it was,
it was odd.

415
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:52,320
We were trying to figure it out.
Like not a bad guy,

416
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,430
but just,
just this weird,

417
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,320
like almost like I was envious.
Like,

418
00:16:57,321 --> 00:17:01,190
why is this guy so confidence?
He's like,

419
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,210
fucking outerspace.
I wish you guys go.

420
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,160
Was it good?
It looks good.

421
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:08,560
Looking at a good time.
All right.

422
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,970
I brought you over here.
It was weird.

423
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:13,010
I was always trying to figure out what
was going on with this guy.

424
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:16,940
And then once he approached me,
started asking me about the Cryo therapy

425
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:18,710
thing and how,
because I do it all the time.

426
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,060
Then he,
uh,

427
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,300
started slowly revealing that he's had a
pretty traumatic,

428
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,940
a back surgery or a back injury.

429
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,890
The thing that was great for me that
happened a doing bigger,

430
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:32,200
stronger,
faster and doing this movie is you

431
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:35,290
become almost like a priest where people
come to you and confess.

432
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,140
And so everybody comes out of the
woodwork.

433
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,460
You made a movie.
He said,

434
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:40,420
hey,
I do pills,

435
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,860
or hey,
I take steroids.

436
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,143
Big Deal,
you know,

437
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,810
and you talk about what happened and
what the effects were and what the

438
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:49,440
negative effects were.
And people just come to you and say,

439
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:50,040
Hey man,
I've

440
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,790
had a pill problem for 20 years,
you know,

441
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,110
and you're like,
that's,

442
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,250
that's how these people got into Rehab.
Are they called me?

443
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:57,270
Uh,
I actually,

444
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:59,550
uh,
a kid that worked on the movie,

445
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,390
he worked on the movie and he was
actually the president of the company's,

446
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,640
like a brother and he was the one that
called me and said,

447
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:08,971
hey,
look,

448
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,290
I know I've worked on.
You're moving everything.

449
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,240
I have a problem though,
you know,

450
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,430
after I saw the movie,
I just need to fix it.

451
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,520
What do I do?
Isn't it incredible?

452
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,240
These fucking people that are running
for president,

453
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:20,070
not a single one has brought any of this
shit up.

454
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,030
We're talking about a massive epidemic
where people are dropping like flies.

455
00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:25,980
People were being addicted.
It's not sexy.

456
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,080
Probably things we'll talk about is a
dark thing to talk about.

457
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:28,810
Even watching a movie.

458
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,870
It's kind of a dark thing to get into,
not just that,

459
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,720
it's that they can't talk about it
because then they'll face repercussions

460
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:37,020
for pharmaceutical industry.
Trump is the only person that can talk

461
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:37,621
about it,
you know?

462
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:39,330
I hope he does.
I hope he does too.

463
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:41,400
I think it's donald trump's
responsibility.

464
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,070
Donald trump are calling you out right
here that we're calling you out,

465
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:45,780
Donald.
Goofy.

466
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:48,450
Fuck,
I swear I'll vote for you if you say

467
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:51,150
something about he's listening.
Bell Brothers,

468
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:51,984
Ronnie,
he's into it.

469
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,400
He's kind of busy,
but you know,

470
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,180
I think that that's,
that's a big problem is that one of the

471
00:18:57,181 --> 00:19:00,210
biggest problems this country special
interest because it doesn't matter what

472
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:02,460
it is.
Like there's all these special interests

473
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,640
including the corn industry trying to
push high fructose corn syrup on it.

474
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,090
Yeah.
Anything you're looking at.

475
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,710
There's a sugar lobby,
there's the corn lobby,

476
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:15,090
there's lobby for everything and it just
twists the truth around and makes

477
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:16,250
people,
you know,

478
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,210
maybe you know,
vote for things that they maybe

479
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:18,690
wouldn't.

480
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,260
It's interesting though that that
statistic that when they changed the

481
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,090
Oxycontin,
when they changed the formula where you

482
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:26,760
couldn't crush it and smoking,
they lost 80 percent of their profit.

483
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,240
At least that tells us that some people
are looking out in the right direction

484
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:37,110
and absolutely they're doing so because
of things like your documentary and it's

485
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:40,560
one of the most important things about
doing a documentary like that.

486
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:44,040
It starts this conversation and people
start talking about it and you start

487
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,140
comparing notes and they start realizing
like,

488
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:48,420
wow,
these are people that I know people

489
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,520
around me.
It's just this is a giant issue.

490
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:52,290
I have to say,
like in my movie,

491
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,630
a lot of people wanted me to give more
answers.

492
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,890
What's the solution?
I'm like,

493
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:59,460
I don't really have a solution.
This is a giant problem that we need to

494
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:04,461
talk about and come up with bigger
solutions because I'm just a documentary

495
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:05,160
film maker.

496
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,380
I'm just telling you what happened in my
life.

497
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:10,860
I'm not trying to run for president.
I'm not trying to make a make a law

498
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:11,760
about this.
I'm just like,

499
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,170
hey man,
this is a big problem.

500
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,400
What are we supposed to do about it?
And that's what I think that's

501
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,890
collectively as a country,
we come up with what the solution is a

502
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:24,630
real problem in that these people that
sell these things are making ungodly

503
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:27,840
amounts of money.
When you showed that seminar that they

504
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:30,190
had where they were all talking about,
you know,

505
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,600
you guys are going to make insane
amounts of money and they were just

506
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:38,580
openly talking about how their drug
patch right here actually wrote this

507
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:41,000
down,
this drug it's called Avandia,

508
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,420
was for diabetes,
right?

509
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,370
And so they're given this drug to all
these people with diabetes and the

510
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:47,710
dropping dead.
One third of the people that were

511
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:48,280
prescribed

512
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,570
the drug were dying from it.
Right?

513
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,760
And so what it was was a drug for
diabetes that actually gave you a heart

514
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:56,500
attack.
And most of the people that have

515
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,870
diabetes,
that's the number one cause of death,

516
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:00,610
right?
So when you look at that,

517
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:01,061
you go,
okay,

518
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,410
well how did this company get away with
it?

519
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,850
Well,
when they made the drug,

520
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,590
they packed away $6,000,000,000 in an
account just to basically,

521
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:08,930
you know,
they,

522
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,150
they put $6,000,000,000.
Why?

523
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,430
Because they knew they were going to get
sued and they ended up getting,

524
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,850
getting sued only for 3 billion.
Like,

525
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:14,291
oh,
okay,

526
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,360
cool.
But they made like $20 million on the

527
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:16,791
drug.
It's,

528
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,720
it's ridiculous.
The things that are going on that are

529
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:22,540
getting covered up and nobody's talking
about like in the film,

530
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,510
I don't know if you saw that drug that
was made in the United States.

531
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:29,260
It was tainted with AIDS.
It was tainted with the AIDS virus and

532
00:21:29,261 --> 00:21:30,041
they said,
you know what?

533
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,870
Well we can't lose this big batch of
drugs.

534
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,770
Let's send it to France.
What is.

535
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,750
I don't understand that though.
How does the AIDS virus get into this?

536
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,690
What is the AIDS virus?
You're talking about HIV.

537
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,850
I have no idea.
I have no idea,

538
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:47,360
but that's where the news report says
it.

539
00:21:47,361 --> 00:21:51,170
Say the news report was all grainy and
it was from 1985.

540
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,680
They might not know what the fuck
they're talking about now.

541
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:56,890
It would definitely was something that I
was a head scratcher and I actually have

542
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:58,980
a guy.
There's a guy that works out at mark's.

543
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,890
Jim just got his phd and he was going to
go work for the company bear.

544
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,800
That was a company that sold.
They make their aspirin everything.

545
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,290
That's a company that did it and I was.
One of the things he was.

546
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,400
He was talking about,
he's like,

547
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:10,900
I don't know if I want to work for a
company like that.

548
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,290
Yeah,
we need to snopes snopes that before you

549
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,670
put it in the documentary.
Actually,

550
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:16,504
actually,
yes.

551
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,120
We have a big team.
Taste tastes a few of those.

552
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,530
When we do these documentaries,
we have.

553
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,890
Look at this,
we have a team of people.

554
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,033
Fact check everything.

555
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,090
The little larger police here it goes.
Recently,

556
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:32,510
unearth documents show that the drug
company beer sold millions of dollars

557
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:36,860
worth of injectable blood clotting
medicine factor eight,

558
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,210
concentrate intended for haemophiliacs
to Asian Latin American in some European

559
00:22:41,211 --> 00:22:44,960
countries in the mid 19 eighties.
Although they knew it was tainted with

560
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:46,160
aids.
So yeah,

561
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:47,420
that's what I understand.
Like how so

562
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,160
tatum aids go together.
That makes sense.

563
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,170
Cool.
Ten years ago,

564
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,030
uh,
so as the company stopped selling the

565
00:22:56,031 --> 00:23:00,050
drug in the United States in 1984,
but continue to sell it overseas for an

566
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,940
additional year,
the medicine was made using a combined.

567
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,793
Oh,
okay.

568
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,180
Plasma from large numbers of donors.
And at the time there was no screening

569
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:12,200
test for eight for the AIDS virus.
So a tiny number of donors with AIDS

570
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,410
could inadvertently contaminate a large
batch.

571
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,670
Whoa.
They continued to sell the medicine

572
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:24,200
overseas and attempt to avoid being left
with a large stock of a drug that was no

573
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:26,150
longer marketable in the United States.
Well,

574
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:28,280
you know,
that's what they also did with that aids

575
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,400
medication.
Um,

576
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,530
what does that stuff that was fucking
killing everybody act,

577
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,433
act,
uh,

578
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,260
act was initially a chemotherapy
medication,

579
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:39,060
but it was killing cancer patients
quicker than the cancer was.

580
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,460
And they push that through because the
aids epidemic was so huge.

581
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,190
They pushed that through so fast and
then they knew it wasn't

582
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,350
working and they kept pushing,
pushing,

583
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:49,700
pushing,
and just not working.

584
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:50,870
It was fucking killing.
Yeah,

585
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,420
absolutely.
And they,

586
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,450
they used to call hades the gay cancer.
That's what they thought it was at one

587
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:57,770
point in time,
you know,

588
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:02,670
it's the whole thing is just disgusting.
It's so terrifying when you think of a

589
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,680
company that's valuing money in,
at such a high level that they're

590
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:12,050
willing to do something like that and
ship this tainted drugs to these other

591
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:13,190
kinds of.
I don't even know these people.

592
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,480
Right.
Just send it over there.

593
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,950
Fuck France.
Exactly.

594
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,110
Yeah.
It's crazy.

595
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,620
And they're still in business.
The thing is they market.

596
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,400
They market to the doctors so much that
they put,

597
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,510
they spend like $5 million on marketing
us and like 25 billion marketing to the

598
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,090
doctors.
So they're telling the doctors that to

599
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:35,270
like push these drugs and push these
treats treatments on people.

600
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,370
And if you look at the statistics of
like Medicare,

601
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,080
there's like 30,000 people every year
that die from treatments that they

602
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,000
didn't even need.
And that's a fact.

603
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:46,160
That's like a medicare fact.
It's like why are we,

604
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,500
how are we giving people medicine that
they don't need?

605
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:49,910
It's killing them.
It makes no sense.

606
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:50,744
You know,
it's like,

607
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,530
it's all because of money and they don't
really know what the medicines will do

608
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:55,970
to people and they just keep giving it
given,

609
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:57,440
uh,
given how harmful are some of the other

610
00:24:57,441 --> 00:24:59,120
drugs,
like the restless leg syndrome.

611
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:03,170
And like I saw one the other day that
said they have a medication for if you

612
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:05,510
laugh too much or if he cries too much
or whatever.

613
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,560
But it gave me that she smoked pot,
take this truck,

614
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,370
they restless leg syndrome.
Is that bullshit?

615
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,090
Like what is that?
I actually have a experience that

616
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,960
because I've had like surgery,
I have like a weird circulation things

617
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,330
what I feel is right when they were
like,

618
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:27,320
what happens is like it's on days I had
too much caffeine or too much sugar.

619
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,120
It's,
I feel it's like something that's like

620
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:30,740
self induced.
But uh,

621
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,040
it actually is something that is rare,
you know,

622
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,040
it's very rare but it's something that
they advertise and you know,

623
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,660
so it only would happen if there was
external things involved for me.

624
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,350
Yeah,
I dunno.

625
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,183
I Dunno if,
if,

626
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,740
if it's completely like surgeries and
stuff.

627
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:47,660
And here's the thing though.
A lot of things aren't completely a

628
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:48,650
myth.
Like a lot of things.

629
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,040
Maybe a fact like point zero,
zero,

630
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,300
zero,
one percent of the population go,

631
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,310
how do I get that to effect,
you know,

632
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,720
30 percent of the population.
Well,

633
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,940
I advertise the shit out of it and make
people feel like they have restless leg

634
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:01,580
syndrome,
so I'll get all the caffeine addicts.

635
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,280
He'll get all the sugar addicts and you
know,

636
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,620
let's go.
Yeah.

637
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,050
It's marketed to those people,
you know,

638
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,460
you know,
another thing that's really

639
00:26:07,461 --> 00:26:11,480
controversial that you touched on in
your documentary that I think is a

640
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:12,890
really important thing to discuss.

641
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,720
His depression,
you know,

642
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,790
depression,
depression is a big one,

643
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:19,490
man.
It's a big one because it's so hard to

644
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:21,690
lock down.
Whether or not this is a.

645
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,990
is it a medical condition or is it just
a state of your life right now?

646
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:31,991
Is it you reacting to all the doctor
itself to really hard as a friend going

647
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:36,560
through rehab and I feel great and I
turn on like,

648
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,630
how do you feel buddy?
You know,

649
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,160
I'm trying to help these people too and
we're all helping each other.

650
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:41,030
Right?
And like so good.

651
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,190
Oh,
I'm depressed about what we're,

652
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:44,110
we're in,
we're in,

653
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:44,971
you know,
in a,

654
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:48,300
in Malibu or in a beautiful place and
they're just depressed and you don't,

655
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,020
you can't understand it.
I think it's something that we just

656
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:55,110
don't know enough enough about it,
enough how to treat it and I think we

657
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:59,130
treated with pills that make you a
Zombie so you just don't feel it and we

658
00:26:59,131 --> 00:27:00,870
never faced stuff that causes more
depression.

659
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,960
Even like alcohol and stuff like that.
Also all sorts of other factors

660
00:27:03,961 --> 00:27:06,360
involved,
like what are you doing with your life?

661
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:08,640
Like how much of your life is spent
doing productive,

662
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:10,860
enjoyable things will kind of support
group.

663
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:14,490
Do you have as far as your friends,
are your friends like really happy,

664
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:17,460
really healthy people?
Are you engaging in a lot of physical

665
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,290
activity?
Are you eating healthy?

666
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,720
Are you getting enough rest?
Are you drinking enough water?

667
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:24,080
All those things are a big factor.
Huge.

668
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,580
You are you doing what you want to do
with your life?

669
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,540
It's hard to explain.
I have a friend that has an awesome

670
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,310
family.
He's got a ton of money.

671
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:37,350
He's got everything that you could see
from the outside that we might want as a

672
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:38,021
human being.
Right?

673
00:27:38,021 --> 00:27:38,851
Yeah.
That's really cool.

674
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:40,320
He's got.
He can do whatever he wants.

675
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:42,360
Right?
Beautiful Wife,

676
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,700
great kids,
but he's depressed and I'm like,

677
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,920
well I have no idea how to help that.

678
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,120
Like zero,
you know,

679
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:50,400
other than like he needs to go see a
therapist.

680
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:53,610
That's like Kinda the only way that you
can treat it because I think like us as

681
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:55,350
friends don't just don't understand it.
Well,

682
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:58,500
I think there's no one answer that works
with everybody.

683
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,770
Some people really suffer with any sort
of balance,

684
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,590
you know?
Sometimes people get these extreme highs

685
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:06,960
and extreme lows,
but it's hard for them to like ride it

686
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:08,610
out in the middle.
We've heard before,

687
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:10,880
we're like from our friends at like
wrestle a,

688
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,300
you know,
that they'll get this huge high,

689
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,330
much like yourself going out in front of
a big audience can be all fucking fired

690
00:28:15,331 --> 00:28:17,400
up,
be funny as hell and then you got to go

691
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:19,170
home and your wife's like,
he didn't take out the garbage,

692
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,470
like hard to go back to being a dad and
have a normal,

693
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,650
a normal role in the household because
there's no like fans cheering for you.

694
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,150
So I think a lot of those guys were,
the ups and downs are so wild,

695
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,170
but,
but it's also,

696
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:31,620
you know,
it's,

697
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,890
it makes it 10 times worse because
they're doing a lot of drugs,

698
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,860
you know,
so the highs and lows or even amplified

699
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:39,270
even more.
Not only that,

700
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:42,450
but there's also a lot of trauma going
on with their body and their brain.

701
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,840
I think that plays a giant factor and a
really do.

702
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,100
I know a lot of people that have had a
lot of physical trauma and they have

703
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,740
almost all of them have a hard time with
depression.

704
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,810
But being happy as a choice.
I think,

705
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,550
you know,
he and I talk about this kind of stuff

706
00:28:56,551 --> 00:29:00,270
all the time and I've seen people that
have their fucking legs blown off or

707
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,700
more and they got the biggest fucking
smile on their face.

708
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,760
We've seen some people in some pretty
shitty situations I have.

709
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,860
He has a guide as Jim.
This Guy Bryce.

710
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,140
He's trying to figure out how to dead
lift with one leg.

711
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,540
He doesn't have a prosthetic leg.
He's trying to figure out a deadlift any

712
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,800
days all the way up.
Yeah.

713
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,460
He's all the way up by the hip so he
can't.

714
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,680
A prosthetic can kind of work but not
really know,

715
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,270
but yeah,
we've seen people in all kinds of shitty

716
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:24,270
situations and they still got to.
They're still fucking smile and they're

717
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:28,440
still finding other things to live for,
whether it's lifting weights or doing,

718
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,630
you know,
fucking climbing rocks or whatever the

719
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:32,680
hell it is they're doing.
Does she,

720
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,320
like you said,
doing some productive shit.

721
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,840
Pursuing enjoyable activities is a big
one.

722
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,270
Pursuing something that you really have
a passion for,

723
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,520
like as a career is another big one.
I think there's a lot of people that

724
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:46,900
feel that soul sucking grind of day to
day nine to five doing something they

725
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:51,901
hate is just unbelievably taxing as like
being a filmmaker.

726
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,840
Every film I've done have done three of
them that I've directed and one of that

727
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:59,290
I produced it every time.
It's about raising the money and getting

728
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:03,580
going and it's just so hard and it's a.
I would get depressed in between

729
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:05,490
projects,
so I'd have like these great highest,

730
00:30:05,491 --> 00:30:06,131
a bigger,
stronger,

731
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:08,020
faster.
Came out at Sundance Film Festival.

732
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,960
Everybody's talking about is 96 percent
on rotten tomatoes.

733
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,510
I'm up here.
Then I got to go get money to make the

734
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,490
next movie and I'm down here because I'm
broke.

735
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,500
I have no money.
You don't make a lot of money on these

736
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:22,210
things and it's just an up and down
business and then at least you're doing

737
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:23,110
it for you.
Sure.

738
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:24,700
And after,
but after all of it,

739
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,860
after all said and done,
because it's not about the money,

740
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:29,080
it's about for me doing something
awesome.

741
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,060
You know,
at the end of the day I talked to my

742
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:34,020
brother after I got sober and he said,
you know what man?

743
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,640
You're biggest problem is you don't need
anybody.

744
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,400
You've done it all yourself already.
Why do you need anybody?

745
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:42,490
You don't need anybody to help you just
keep doing what you're doing and that's

746
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:44,860
like,
that gave me so much confidence and

747
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:48,250
empower yourself to empower yourself and
build confidence.

748
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:52,810
Confidence is huge and in depression,
I'm not depressed anymore.

749
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,640
I don't feel,
I don't have a project right now and

750
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,880
money for practicing now,
but I don't care because it's like,

751
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:58,961
yeah,
we'll get it,

752
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:00,160
we'll do it.
We've done it before.

753
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,260
You know,
so I think that building your own

754
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,890
confidence is big in getting over the
depression.

755
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,120
Got To be a certain amount of depression
that's allowed to,

756
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,650
you know,
something terrible happens.

757
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,050
You gotTa,
you gotta allow for some of that.

758
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,330
Allow for some of that to come in and
just to happen.

759
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,500
Even not even terrible.

760
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,410
Like for me,
I'll fuck up one joke and a killer set

761
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:21,370
where I get a standing ovation at one
joke will fuck my head up man.

762
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,850
I will.
I'll just be driving home going,

763
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,090
fuck,
I'll just,

764
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,570
I'll sit at home.
I'll go over that.

765
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,950
Yeah.
What about Ronda Rousey?

766
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,970
You know,
after the law,

767
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,880
you know what she said on Ellen
degenerate.

768
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,070
That to me that was the coolest fucking
thing that woman has ever done.

769
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:37,180
That.
That was really neat to me.

770
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:40,420
Like I'm a huge fan of hers anyway.
I think she's amazing,

771
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:43,390
but that was fucking awesome to kind of
hear her.

772
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:44,860
Just lay it,
lay it all in a line.

773
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,840
That's a lot going on there.
On top of that,

774
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:51,220
there's also like head trauma.
There's like that.

775
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:53,770
You're going to be depressed.
It was just no way around it.

776
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:55,690
Not,
not just be the fact that she was the

777
00:31:55,691 --> 00:32:00,691
highest of highs as far as celebrity sco
and then she just gets shit on all over

778
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,990
social media.

779
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,130
I mean I read just a few of the things
that he sold people,

780
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,770
all the memes and all the crazy shit
like people,

781
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,240
you know,
they're probably just not even thinking

782
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,640
and we all have fun with different
stuff,

783
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:14,020
but they're trying to be funny,
you know,

784
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,640
trying to be funny,
trying to be clever,

785
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,350
man can't.
You can't look at it if you're Rhonda.

786
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,560
I mean that's also part of what comes
with being that huge

787
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,250
project.
Mcgregor kind of handled it.

788
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,110
I thought I saw on your instagram you
said,

789
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:30,820
hey,
this is the best way that he handled it.

790
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,950
Like a fucking man.
He went out there,

791
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,430
he put a picture of him struggling with
a nice suit on and he said,

792
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:38,870
I went out there and I took a shot.
I will not apologize.

793
00:32:38,871 --> 00:32:40,070
It will stop being me.

794
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,470
And then he wrote Dosantos,
you are a pussy,

795
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:45,740
although you are a pussy.
That great.

796
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:46,910
Great.
Back to talking to shit.

797
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:47,840
Yeah,
exactly.

798
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,420
It's what made him and he said he's
going right back to it,

799
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:52,540
you know,
and the thing is if he,

800
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:55,610
if he loses more fights or whatever,
that might get worse and it might go

801
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:56,490
away,
but if he,

802
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,890
what if he doesn't,
you know,

803
00:32:57,891 --> 00:32:59,540
you become a legend forever,
you know,

804
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,980
so he can,
he'll get better,

805
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,190
he'll get better and he'll learn and you
know,

806
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,880
that's.
But that's beside the point.

807
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:08,030
I think I'm lowe's,
like you said,

808
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:12,290
are important because what a bad feeling
does for me,

809
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,110
someone who's really hard on themselves
when they screw up one thing and it

810
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:18,890
really drives me nuts that what that
does is that motivates me to be more

811
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:22,040
focused and more intense and pay more
attention to what I'm doing.

812
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,130
And if I don't do that,
I will feel that same thing again,

813
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,830
you know,
and there's like a certain amount of,

814
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:30,500
uh,
like those bad feelings where things go

815
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:32,360
wrong.
You just got to accept in your life,

816
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,560
you know,
like breakups,

817
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:36,170
breakups are devastating for people.
You know,

818
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:40,340
like when someone breaks up with you,
sometimes you feel like they stole a

819
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:43,120
part of you,
they stole some of your happiness.

820
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,410
It's a huge investment to be in a
relationship with somebody.

821
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,280
But you got to realize when that's over,
when that breakups over,

822
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:49,881
like,
hey man,

823
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:53,090
like this is,
this gives you an opportunity to move on

824
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,740
and to get your life in order better and
to,

825
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,100
to look at yourself,
give it to be by yourself for a while

826
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,740
and understand how much you value a
healthy relationship.

827
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,890
He's had a lot of good ones,
bad ones.

828
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,070
He had a girl call him up and say,
we can't date anymore because I have

829
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:14,120
cancer by that set.
And it was over and she actually have

830
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:16,910
cancer.
No big lie.

831
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,600
It's part of this whole guys got nothing
story.

832
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,580
I mean,
how is she going to get rid of,

833
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:24,620
you know,
what,

834
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:25,371
uh,
what else can you say?

835
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:26,990
Listen,
you're just not fun.

836
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,370
Yeah,
you're fat and ugly.

837
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,670
You got a small Dick,
you know,

838
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:34,280
I guess I have cancer pie.
It's not that bad,

839
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,150
but you know,
those,

840
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,730
those are important and you know,
you don't want to be with that person

841
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:39,050
anyway if that's how they feel about
you.

842
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,950
You got to find the person that really
likes you or you gotta figure out how to

843
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:47,030
become someone who people like.
And that's part of the struggle of

844
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:50,330
developing as a human being too.
And that's a Rut that some people never

845
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:50,840
get out of.

846
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,390
Some people they get into this Rut like
in high school,

847
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,660
like in dating in high school and
college and they fucking never get out

848
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:57,890
of that.
They're always in combative,

849
00:34:57,891 --> 00:35:01,550
shitty relationships forever and they
never pause and reset.

850
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,880
They never have like a relationship.
Rehab was a lot.

851
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,600
It takes a lot of strength to walk away
from anything that you have invested

852
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,390
time in.
Right?

853
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,460
Yeah.
I mean even shitty relationships.

854
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:12,890
At least they have familiarity to them.
I think,

855
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,820
you know,
Ronda Rousey,

856
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,170
she said,
if I'm not this,

857
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:17,510
then what am I like?
To me that was a huge statement.

858
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:19,280
You know,
that people are always,

859
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:21,440
uh,
being defined by other people.

860
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:23,900
You got to be defined by yourself.
It's got to come,

861
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:26,930
it's got to come internally.
It's got to be hard for her because she

862
00:35:26,931 --> 00:35:28,800
is such a mega star and she is known as
a fighter.

863
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,510
She knows,
you know,

864
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,330
the most dominant female fighter of all
time.

865
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:35,690
So it's got to be.
So it's also like that kind of success,

866
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:39,300
like that kind of love and notoriety is
so unnatural.

867
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,570
So that high is so unnatural.
It's strange.

868
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:44,890
It's like almost like the Oxycontin of
achievement.

869
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:50,520
You when you are,
you're achieving something athletically.

870
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:53,420
It's not as simple as like say like the
bench coach.

871
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:53,971
Hey,
a fight,

872
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:56,550
which was probably like her highlight.
She goes down to Brazil,

873
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:58,200
she gets cheered,
she fights his girl,

874
00:35:58,201 --> 00:36:01,170
knocks her out in the first round,
struts around like a peacock.

875
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:03,660
The whole world's cheering for.
She's on top of the world.

876
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Everything.
Well,

877
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,430
what actually really happened,
what would actually really happen was

878
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,680
there's two people and they're engaging
in an activity and one person is better

879
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:18,681
at that activity and the other person
and only better by a hair or a margin

880
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,680
like this.

881
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,970
One person is more of a brawler and
she's much more nervous and she makes

882
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:27,630
mistakes and then the other person is
better under pressure and she connects

883
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:30,810
with better shots and then the other
person gets hit on the button and it

884
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:35,811
goes down like the actual actual events
of what happened or not.

885
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:39,630
That big of a deal.
I mean it happens in gyms all across the

886
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,490
world,
but the fact that it's on this big

887
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,280
stage,
the fact that so many eyes are on that

888
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:47,130
moment gets magnified so the result gets
magnified,

889
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:51,630
so it becomes this really unnatural
state where everybody loves you for this

890
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:55,430
brief moment and you're walking around
glory,

891
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,970
glory.
The glory also comes with the potential.

892
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:03,690
Any high comes with the potential of a
corresponding low.

893
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,030
I mean there's just no way around.
It's exactly.

894
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,910
It's exactly.
The thing that killed our brother was

895
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,210
was that he constantly wanted to be in
the wwe,

896
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:15,480
constantly wanted to be something and
when people told him like,

897
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:16,410
Hey,
you're,

898
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,900
you're getting too old for this or
you're not in shape enough for this.

899
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,960
Like he couldn't really handle that.
Now.

900
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,590
That was a big part of his depression
was he was trying to be defined by this,

901
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,680
a wrestling league that only gives very
few people a shot and those people have

902
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:35,160
either really earned it or they knew
somebody or whatever and got in and he

903
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:38,310
was always trying to get to that and my
dad says,

904
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,150
even if you did get to it,
I think he,

905
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,500
he still would've went the same way
because he wouldn't.

906
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,970
He would have went the other way.
We've been like crazy because he had

907
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,590
money and he had fame and whatever,
you know.

908
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,480
Well,
a lot of times it's the way you look at

909
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:50,520
life,
like the parameters that you set for

910
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:53,100
your life.
If those parameters are fucked up,

911
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,640
it's going to make your life fucked up
no matter what you get involved in.

912
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,260
And that's something that you find with
some people,

913
00:37:58,261 --> 00:38:00,420
some people that are happy and they
become successful,

914
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,630
they can be happy and successful in
pretty much everything they do.

915
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,980
They have good parameters that they've
set up good behavior patterns and in the

916
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:11,670
people that have bad behavior patterns
are self destructive behavior patterns.

917
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,830
Those things repeat themselves over and
over again.

918
00:38:13,831 --> 00:38:17,220
Even when they get on a roll,
like I have friends that I know they get

919
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:18,110
on a roll,
they,

920
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,460
everything's going good but I know
they're going to fuck up.

921
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:23,370
It's just a matter of time.
And then one day you'll see them and

922
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:25,400
they're drinking again.
Like I thought you quit drinking,

923
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,643
you know,
man,

924
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:30,890
my fucking my fucking mcgreal lift and
running out.

925
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:34,800
I want to hear it and I check your urine
in a business or comedy.

926
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:37,270
Right.
A lot of people are kind of like that.

927
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,210
I like Kinda kinda miserable.
Kind of like that's why they,

928
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,440
they make fun of things because I to
deal with that,

929
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,460
like kind of avoid maybe hanging out
with some of those people are.

930
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,140
Yeah,
my friends are all pretty happy.

931
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:48,880
I mean,
I've had friends that have had problems

932
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:50,890
with depression,
have helped some friends that had

933
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:52,750
problems.
I had a buddy who got depressed because

934
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:56,440
he was taking propecia.
Something you should be concerned with

935
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:58,180
folks if you're losing your hair,
first of all,

936
00:38:58,181 --> 00:38:59,860
shaved your head.
It's greatest thing I ever did.

937
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,270
I love and had said,
oh,

938
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,380
it's glorious.
I love it.

939
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,110
I feel like anybody who won't fuck you
because your head shaved.

940
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,840
You wouldn't want to fuck them anyway
because you're awake.

941
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,830
You're barely getting them to fuck you.
Get in there,

942
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,520
you know,
they don't like you that much.

943
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,230
They only fuck you because you have the
right.

944
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,700
But uh,
but my friend was taken propecia and he

945
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:22,690
was getting seriously depressed and he
didn't connect the two of them together

946
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,500
and you know,
I got him to a psychiatrist and helped

947
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,950
him out.
And he actually was.

948
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,570
He benefited from psych drugs because
those psych drugs got him happy and

949
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:34,990
weaned him off and got him on on point.
God is life in order.

950
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,900
And then once his life got an order,
he weaned himself off those things.

951
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,250
And it's also the right way to use them.
Yeah.

952
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,010
You're not the press forever,
right?

953
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:44,200
I mean,
he also got off that fucking piece of

954
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:45,640
shit.
It's not for everybody.

955
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:47,290
I took her patient for awhile.
It didn't,

956
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:49,380
didn't make me depressed,
but a lot of people that makes them

957
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:50,050
impotent.
Like,

958
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:50,950
yes,
he definitely did.

959
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:52,900
That didn't,
didn't kill my Dick,

960
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,190
but it beat the shit out of it.

961
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,023
Yes,
that's

962
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,733
right.
Yeah,

963
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,100
you will.
It doesn't keep you from getting it up,

964
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,860
but it's definitely not the same.
And I didn't even realize it was her

965
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,920
pubes big and your dick smaller now my
prescription ran out and I was like,

966
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:13,450
ah,
I've got to get to the doctor and refill

967
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:16,180
my prescription.
All of a sudden I've got this raging

968
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,410
boner all the time,
like,

969
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,620
what's going on down here?
And then I.

970
00:40:19,621 --> 00:40:20,920
and then I went,
oh my God,

971
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:23,590
it's the propecia.
Like this is what my dick supposed to be

972
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,440
like.
Ridiculous getting off.

973
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:31,441
This shit had went out and bought quit
propecia long before I shaved my head.

974
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,460
But it was,
um,

975
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,760
that,
that my friend going through that was

976
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:39,200
really scary because he was a,
you know,

977
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,440
he was really,
really depressed and it was like,

978
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:44,470
I was like shit,
like I got to figure out a way to help

979
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:46,690
this guy because this is not who we
normally is.

980
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,000
Normally he would be like happy and
joking.

981
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:54,120
Like comics are all kind of fucked up in
a way and that are performers.

982
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,650
They see things fucked up in the.
Usually.

983
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,890
Usually when you're getting on stage,
the reason why you do it in the first

984
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:02,920
place is you're compensating for
something that's missing,

985
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:07,270
like a lack of attention you got when
you were young or lack of self esteem

986
00:41:07,271 --> 00:41:10,810
and you're trying to make up for it by
your performances on stage and you're

987
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:14,590
trying to get the audience to like you.
It's like almost like a hustle in a way.

988
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,650
And the reward,
if you can come up with jokes and

989
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:20,330
routines that are good enough to get the
people to the lab,

990
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,170
you get them to feel good.
And then that becomes your new self

991
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:25,540
esteem.
And just said it's a real tricky trap.

992
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:27,760
Do you think for yourself,
you,

993
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,930
you don't really fit the mold or do.

994
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,680
I definitely don't fit all the molds,
but I fit some of the molds,

995
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:35,780
you know,
I mean the same mold that got me into

996
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:39,530
martial arts was the same mold that got
me into comedy in the mold that got me

997
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:42,800
into martial arts was feeling like I was
a loser,

998
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:47,180
feeling like nobody gave a shit about me
and that everybody doubted me and then I

999
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:51,020
just didn't have anybody to count on and
I was always worried about getting my

1000
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:51,831
ass kicked.
I'm like,

1001
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:53,840
fuck,
I've got to figure out how to fight.

1002
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,810
And I wasn't a big guy,
you know,

1003
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,090
I'm only five eight,
so I was just like short kid and you

1004
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:00,550
know,
in high school like when I started was

1005
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,790
even shorter.
So it was like,

1006
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:03,500
fuck man,
I got to learn how to fight.

1007
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,130
And I just was tired of feeling scared,
but it was the same thing.

1008
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,550
It was like I was looking for something
that I was good at to boost up my self

1009
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:13,370
esteem.
How has the short kid and you know,

1010
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:16,720
lifting for me,
like I bench pressed three slash 15 in

1011
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,510
11th grade and then four or five by the
time I was a senior and I was blowing

1012
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:23,150
people away and the same with mark.
He benched 300,

1013
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:26,880
15 pounds in ninth grade and he was
dyslexic or learning disabled.

1014
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,770
All these things.
So that gave us confidence.

1015
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,120
You know,
sometimes the deficits that you,

1016
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,280
you achieve and or that you experienced
in life,

1017
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,500
they can help you if you can get through
them.

1018
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,230
If you can get over that.
If you can get over those humps,

1019
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,730
they can give you motivation and fuel.
That's why kids that are born rich and

1020
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:47,210
privileged and live in a big ass house
and they get everything they want.

1021
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:51,530
They very rarely have the drive to
accomplish great things because a lot of

1022
00:42:51,531 --> 00:42:56,270
times that drive comes from that feeling
of poverty or that feeling of loss or

1023
00:42:56,271 --> 00:43:00,920
that feeling of just being lonely and
depressed and like you get motivated to

1024
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:03,190
go out there and make your mark like the
film.

1025
00:43:03,191 --> 00:43:04,310
He did a trophy.
Kids,

1026
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:05,960
you know,
like there's a,

1027
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:07,040
all these kids,
you know what,

1028
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:09,500
these parents paying thousands of
dollars for these kids who go to these

1029
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:13,010
special camps and stuff like that and
the best athletes in the world had their

1030
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:15,200
parents just take a hike on.
I'm usually or die.

1031
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,210
Yeah.
One of the other,

1032
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:19,040
or sometimes there's divorced.
Mark was coaching football.

1033
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:21,770
One time I'll never forget this,
and a parent came to him and said,

1034
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,960
how do I make my kid great at football?
He said,

1035
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:25,560
drop them off in the ghetto.
You know,

1036
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:27,240
that's how you're gonna.

1037
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,030
Make them good.
Is like he's to be mad.

1038
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,030
Kids got to be some aggressiveness is
some.

1039
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:34,130
My kids got to be angry and then also
too,

1040
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:39,131
like you know when someone's coming to
you at like 16 or 17 years old and

1041
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:41,490
they're talking about hey,
like it'd be great to see them get like

1042
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,670
a division one scholarship.
It's like you would already,

1043
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,850
you would already know.
We would've known that 17.

1044
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:48,190
Yeah,
I would have known it.

1045
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,800
11 probably.
You know like the kids just a mutant and

1046
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,460
he's that much bigger and stronger than
everybody.

1047
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:55,820
And he just stands out all the time on
every one of my wife's friends has a

1048
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:58,790
five year old son in this little
motherfucker.

1049
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,640
I pulled her aside,
he takes martial arts and I pulled her

1050
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:03,200
aside and go,
that kid is an athlete.

1051
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,680
He just,
he knows how to use his body.

1052
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,770
Like if he stays with us,
if he's really interested in this,

1053
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,520
he's going to be a bad motherfucker.
Like you could tell that that's crazy

1054
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:16,550
five the way he does cartwheels way
balances himself.

1055
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:19,490
The way he can shift shift positions.
I'm like,

1056
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:21,800
if I had that little kid,
if I could coach that little kid,

1057
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:23,710
I could make them a motherfucker.
You listen,

1058
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,950
that's what happened with trophy kids is
it all starts with good intentions.

1059
00:44:27,951 --> 00:44:29,910
Like you get excited about this
five-year-old.

1060
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,560
But what?
Uh,

1061
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,101
what,
what,

1062
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,130
what about when he's eight?
And he says,

1063
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:32,964
you know what,
Joe,

1064
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,500
I don't want to do Jujitsu anymore.
I don't want to do martial arts center.

1065
00:44:35,501 --> 00:44:38,280
Then you gotta let them go.
Let them go is right.

1066
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:39,750
But then a lot of parents don't let them
go.

1067
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,130
Yeah.
But those people are crazy.

1068
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,630
Well,
that's why it's good you did that

1069
00:44:42,631 --> 00:44:43,270
documentary.

1070
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:44,460
Yeah,
those people are crazy.

1071
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:46,770
You got cars.
That kid might be an awesome guitarist.

1072
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,370
He might give up on Jujitsu and become
this amazing musician.

1073
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:54,390
He might become a writer.
He might just decide that he loves

1074
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,800
exercise just for fun,
but what he really enjoys doing is

1075
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,480
something else.
He wants to be a doctor who the fuck

1076
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:03,630
knows you,
but no one knows that there's so many

1077
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:06,420
different people.
You've got to figure out what it is in

1078
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:09,840
you that you like to express with what
you do for a living.

1079
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:11,190
If you could figure that out,
man.

1080
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,120
That is the fucking thing.
If you can find something you enjoy

1081
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:16,440
doing.
It is the thing.

1082
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,170
I always thought I want them to be in
front of the camera.

1083
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:22,920
I just thought I wanted to be an actor
and I do whatever and I was always short

1084
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,240
and fat and I was like,
well,

1085
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:24,630
I'm not.

1086
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,000
That's not gonna happen unless I'm in.
Got It.

1087
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,970
Yeah,
so my Alfred Hitchcock was in front of

1088
00:45:29,971 --> 00:45:31,140
the camera.
He wasn't that pretty.

1089
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,590
When you're in front of the camera to
document and somewhat and,

1090
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,350
and that kind of happened by accident.
I wasn't trying to be in front of me.

1091
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:39,240
What I like about you in front of the
camera though,

1092
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,103
you're,
you,

1093
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,450
you're wearing the same clothes you
wear,

1094
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,610
you talk the way you talk,
you know,

1095
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,630
like even my wife goes,
is that the guy who makes the

1096
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,880
documentaries go with a backwards
baseball hat on.

1097
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:51,970
That's weird,
right?

1098
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,010
Why?
Why is he dressed like that?

1099
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:54,570
I go because that's how he dresses all
the time.

1100
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,070
I've gone to the gym.
Oh,

1101
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,090
okay.
That makes sense.

1102
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,950
Like that's who you are.
That's who you are.

1103
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,360
That's how you dress.
It's good.

1104
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:01,690
It's a good thing.
Yeah.

1105
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,543
Same all the time.

1106
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,580
You don't have to bullshit anybody.
I think there was a couple interviews in

1107
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:06,121
bigger,
stronger,

1108
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:08,190
faster where I went into like the
senator,

1109
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:09,120
I'm wearing a suit,
you know,

1110
00:46:09,121 --> 00:46:11,400
I just figured like that's probably
appropriate,

1111
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,600
but like other other times I was
interviewed a lawyer and I had dressed

1112
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,370
up a little bit more and then I looked
back at him like why did I do that?

1113
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:17,780
Like,
well,

1114
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,180
I have a bad idea when you're
interviewing a senator or something like

1115
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:23,670
that,
present yourself because the other

1116
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:25,950
people don't take you a little more
seriously and they,

1117
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,930
like,
I've had conversations with people on

1118
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:31,260
the podcast like especially early on in
the career with a kind of like a little

1119
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:34,590
dismissive of me because maybe I had
like a t shirt on that was stupid

1120
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,050
tattoos and smelling it read like
whatever,

1121
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,420
just assume that I'm an idiot,
you know,

1122
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,850
until we have the would be dismissive
initially.

1123
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:42,670
And I was like,
hmm,

1124
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:46,140
approached you to set this up better.
Like if I had an office that looked real

1125
00:46:46,141 --> 00:46:49,170
nice and this desk was like,
this desk is a mess right now.

1126
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:52,440
But if I was at in front of something
that looked more professional,

1127
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:56,610
maybe they would approach this with a
little more professional attitude as

1128
00:46:56,611 --> 00:46:58,110
well.
So you showing up with a suit.

1129
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,760
Not necessarily a bad idea.
I don't think it's a bad idea.

1130
00:47:00,761 --> 00:47:01,880
I have to say that like,
um,

1131
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,660
some of the other interviews where I
wasn't,

1132
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:05,310
you know,
wasn't being me.

1133
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:07,500
And I knew it.
He felt it felt weird.

1134
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,090
Natasha just been me know.
Well,

1135
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:10,140
you know,
it's.

1136
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:14,250
I guess it's,
there's only the only bad way to do it

1137
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,370
when you're doing something like what
you're doing is to do something where

1138
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:20,220
you don't like what you're doing because
it's your work.

1139
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,470
You know,
like these documentaries are your

1140
00:47:22,471 --> 00:47:25,710
creation still.
Think that you don't go confront people.

1141
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:29,330
He'd go ask all the right questions and
you give a,

1142
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,080
give a person

1143
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,940
enough rope to hang themselves.
That happens every single time.

1144
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,430
Yeah.
Well,

1145
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,090
especially if they're full of shit.
Yeah.

1146
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,470
It's magical.
Now when you're acting yourself,

1147
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:41,740
you'll probably get more out of one of
the best shows ever on television was

1148
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:43,320
penn and teller bullshit.
Oh yeah.

1149
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,250
They would just let people ramble and
talk and go,

1150
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,870
and then they would be like,
okay,

1151
00:47:46,871 --> 00:47:48,010
boom.
And they're stopping it and say,

1152
00:47:48,011 --> 00:47:49,060
look at this bullshit.
You know?

1153
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:50,630
That was amazing.
You know?

1154
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,690
That was a great,
great show.

1155
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:54,790
Yeah.
I wonder where they stopped doing that.

1156
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,730
I guess they ran a nine seasons of it,
you know?

1157
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,660
Yeah.
They did it for a pretty long time,

1158
00:47:59,661 --> 00:48:01,720
but it's the one on p to the other day.
I'm like,

1159
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,900
oh my God,
it's amazing that we're working on

1160
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:06,940
something like that.
We're trying to do it in a health and

1161
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:07,770
fitness industry that.

1162
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:08,270
Yeah,
you know,

1163
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,610
we,
we just went to the Arnold sports

1164
00:48:09,611 --> 00:48:10,810
festival and there's,
you know,

1165
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,010
thousands of booths of like 80 percent
of it is stuff that doesn't work

1166
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:15,844
probably,
you know,

1167
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:17,270
like supplements,
supplements,

1168
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,970
and just like different things that
don't.

1169
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,640
I just don't work well.
What's amazing is how many of those

1170
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:23,020
supplements are steroids.
Yeah,

1171
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:23,900
yeah,
yeah,

1172
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,290
yeah.
There's,

1173
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,600
yeah,
there's supposed to be steroids.

1174
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:30,780
The summer ran for a little while until
they get caught on that for a supplement

1175
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:34,690
says it's like testosterone on
testosterone and you're like,

1176
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:36,550
why?
Why are you selling that to people like

1177
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:38,200
that.
That's not a really good message to send

1178
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:40,520
when you know little kids are buying it
or you know,

1179
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,830
whatever.
What is it?

1180
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:44,940
What is testosterone and testosterone
supplement?

1181
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:47,710
I'll find out for you.
That sounds ridiculous.

1182
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:51,310
But when we had jeff,
no Wicki in here,

1183
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:53,350
who was the guy who busted Lance
Armstrong.

1184
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:54,300
Great podcasts.
Yeah,

1185
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,740
he's A.
He's a bad motherfucker when it comes to

1186
00:48:56,741 --> 00:49:00,430
chasing those people down.
But his website that you saw a website

1187
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:02,650
where they show like all the different
stuff,

1188
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,300
they'll,
you'll piss hot from that.

1189
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:06,400
You can just buy at a regular vitamin
store.

1190
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,680
It's fucking crazy.
And just just,

1191
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,080
you get to the a,
you know,

1192
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:13,330
it's listed alphabetically.
Just go through a and there's fucking

1193
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,380
thousands of fucking things.
When he was on,

1194
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:19,180
when he was on your,
when he was on your show,

1195
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:21,700
Lance Armstrong tweeted me a private
message and said,

1196
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:23,440
are you listening to this shit?
I said,

1197
00:49:23,441 --> 00:49:23,950
well,
what is he?

1198
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:24,810
What is these top?
I said,

1199
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,220
you should just go on there.
And then you had him on.

1200
00:49:26,221 --> 00:49:27,054
It was great.
You know,

1201
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,140
lance was great,
but he was awesome.

1202
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:30,940
He was awesome.
You know,

1203
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:33,340
he's helping Dan Bilzerian trained for
that.

1204
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:36,370
A bet.
He's got a bet Danville's area and is

1205
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:38,080
going to drive the instagram guy or
whatever.

1206
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:43,740
He's going to ride his bike from La to
vegas and he has like,

1207
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:47,020
I think 36 hours to do it or something
like that.

1208
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:51,610
And so they made a bet for a 600 grand.
Holy Shit.

1209
00:49:51,611 --> 00:49:55,930
So he's got a ride his bike and uh,
as soon as the bet was announced,

1210
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,590
Lance Armstrong texted me and he's like,
do you know Dan Bilzerian?

1211
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,340
I want to help them with those two guys
together.

1212
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,600
And now lance is helping train them.
Actually never met.

1213
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,380
I've never met Lance Armstrong.
Lance Armstrong has it always been cool

1214
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:14,260
to me through like social media.
And I think that's really cool if you

1215
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,580
can do something,
you know,

1216
00:50:15,581 --> 00:50:17,320
a one time between a bigger,
stronger,

1217
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:18,550
faster.
Everybody should see this movie.

1218
00:50:18,551 --> 00:50:19,980
I was like,
wait,

1219
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:21,760
was before everything happened,
you know?

1220
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,590
And um,
but it was cool.

1221
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:26,590
It's like a way before he got busted.
Yeah.

1222
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,040
I can show you the tweet.
I like his,

1223
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,800
I like his coach.
Like I was wild.

1224
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:33,320
All the different shitty thought I have
to like try to get passed all the tests,

1225
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,680
Ferrari and then he had like his
gardener or whatever,

1226
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:40,960
like go way ahead of everybody and then
and then give him shit at like pit stops

1227
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:41,810
and stuff.
I was like,

1228
00:50:41,811 --> 00:50:44,390
what are you.
Is this real well about the fact that

1229
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:47,720
they were doing blood transfusions in
front of everybody on the bus?

1230
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,970
That was great at the bus broke down
this weekend.

1231
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:52,340
We were at this power lifting meet.
Some guy comes up to mark and says,

1232
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,010
well,
I compete in the drug free division.

1233
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,280
He said,
no drug tested.

1234
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:58,400
There is no drug food and drug tested
you a little bit.

1235
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,960
Is there a single power lifted?
It's not doing steroids.

1236
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,690
There's.
There's a lot of guys that because

1237
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,470
there's like,
let me pull it up better.

1238
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,890
A single successful power lifter.
It's not.

1239
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:15,840
The wild thing is the crazy part we were
talking about this also is that if you

1240
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:18,440
just consistently do the right thing all
the time,

1241
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,410
like if you're hydrated all the time,
you get the right amount of sleep,

1242
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,170
you train hard,
you have a lot of motivation and

1243
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:28,760
determination and you want to be better.
You can actually surpass a lot of the

1244
00:51:28,761 --> 00:51:31,400
guys that are on shit and and we see it
time and time again.

1245
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,940
Whether those guys are actually 100
percent natural.

1246
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,750
It's hard.
It's hard to fucking say.

1247
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:39,920
It's hard to pinpoint,
but I'd have to say out of all the world

1248
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:42,470
records that are broken in these drug
tested federation,

1249
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:45,090
some of these guys have to be quoted at
what it blamed summary.

1250
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:47,180
Know what I mean?
Some of these fucking guys got,

1251
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,580
yeah,
there was a guy that just totally drug

1252
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:53,570
tests and competition and 1100 pounds
squat add one bench and an eight,

1253
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:55,320
15 dead lifts.
I mean he'd swaths

1254
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:01,000
of 1100 pounds squat and check this out,
Blaine Sumner,

1255
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,680
vanilla gorilla.
Mark sponsors the world's strongest man,

1256
00:52:03,681 --> 00:52:06,860
Brian Shaw,
and he bet Brian Shaw.

1257
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,790
He couldn't pick up this 550 pounds
stone and throw it over.

1258
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:12,050
What?
A 54 inch.

1259
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,310
Yeah,
platform.

1260
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,740
He's like,
it was a fucking baby.

1261
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,540
It's on the Internet.
You can watch it.

1262
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:22,130
So Brian brought up.
It's on a youtube baton rogue fitness as

1263
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:25,040
youtube page Jesus.
So Brian did that and um,

1264
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,300
and mark went over.
I said,

1265
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,343
if you could do it,
I'll give you.

1266
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,930
I'll give you five grand.
So the night before he said what?

1267
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:30,810
He said,
hey,

1268
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,990
are we still on with that bed or
whatever?

1269
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,300
I said,
I said some bad.

1270
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:36,450
It's a sponsorship first of all,
but yeah,

1271
00:52:36,451 --> 00:52:37,250
it's,
it's uh,

1272
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,870
well I said that I actually changed my
mind.

1273
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:40,550
I'm gonna make it 10 grand.
Oh my God.

1274
00:52:40,551 --> 00:52:42,380
This guy,
he throws it over that guy.

1275
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,700
Six foot eight.
400.

1276
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:44,540
And wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1277
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:46,760
What am I looking at?
Here is a different event.

1278
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,660
This is a kettle bell.
Oh my God.

1279
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:52,900
Kettlebell 60 pounds.
I think Brian's show.

1280
00:52:52,901 --> 00:52:55,280
That's way more than 60 pounds unless
it's hollow.

1281
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,140
Brian.
60 pound kettlebell.

1282
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,290
But we'd win a whole lot back it up now.
It's probably more like 70 or 80,

1283
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:01,190
but can't be.
Look how.

1284
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,490
Look how big it is.
They have a special implements when.

1285
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:04,701
No,
no,

1286
00:53:04,701 --> 00:53:06,260
no.
Look at the size of that Kettlebell.

1287
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:08,470
The kettlebell,
the way he's walking with it might be

1288
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,040
100.
That has to be hollow.

1289
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:11,270
I don't,
I don't think that,

1290
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:15,910
um,
I don't think there is heavy as he is

1291
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,560
right there on the ground in front of
you.

1292
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:21,200
Look over that Werewolf.
See that Werewolf in the far left.

1293
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,690
It's made differently.
Those are different.

1294
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:27,730
Those are specialty things or cast iron.
Those are specialty things that their

1295
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,100
topics are bad ass.
Well,

1296
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:32,310
the ones that he has,
the only way that they could be outside

1297
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:34,250
on.
It's like a rogue fitness gone.

1298
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,640
Rogue fitness.
His Youtube Channel.

1299
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,150
God,
that guy's ridiculously strong.

1300
00:53:38,151 --> 00:53:40,230
But you mean even if it's fucking six,
he's six foot.

1301
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,360
He's six foot eight,
420 pounds.

1302
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,540
You get close to them and you're like,
I'm going to die.

1303
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,150
This fucking guy.
Nicest guy in the world.

1304
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:50,310
He is very nice,
but you still think he's going to kill

1305
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:53,310
you just because he can fucking Robert
Oberst guy.

1306
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,740
Yeah,
he's a great guy.

1307
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,740
Down to the Ice House one night.
He's ridiculous.

1308
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,990
None of his clothes that none of his
shirts have sleeves.

1309
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,290
How the fuck are they going to cut off
his circulation?

1310
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,810
His hands.
All these guys get on planes and like

1311
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,270
that.
What happens?

1312
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,340
Jesus Christ.
Look at this guy squatting a thousand

1313
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:13,920
102 pounds of Seville.
Another girl right there.

1314
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,410
Okay.
Now tell me he's clean.

1315
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:22,340
He's in a drug test at federation,
so he gets me his blood tested.

1316
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,840
Say,
uh,

1317
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,520
that's insane.
I blame someone or you're lying.

1318
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,450
There you go.
I mean,

1319
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,630
I believe my guests can.
Hey,

1320
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,550
this guy's a big hunter like yourself.
He's like,

1321
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:34,830
he's into fishing and shit.
Like does he use his teeth?

1322
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:36,500
Is he pulled out?
He probably

1323
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:41,910
isn't the record.
Throws a 45 pound plate at their head.

1324
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,830
Game of thrones,
actor half door Bjornsen.

1325
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:49,590
He's on game of thrones.
He threw a 56 pound kettlebell over a 40

1326
00:54:49,591 --> 00:54:51,140
foot record.

1327
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:55,170
So 50 foot six,
11,

1328
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:57,570
six,
10 is retarded about being.

1329
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,620
These guys are
world record of it.

1330
00:55:01,621 --> 00:55:03,320
So Oh my God,
it's heavy,

1331
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,250
heaviest thing.
But if you try to throw a 30 pound

1332
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,980
Kettlebell over that thing,
we would probably die doing it.

1333
00:55:07,981 --> 00:55:08,840
Here it is.
Here's the book,

1334
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,260
here's the video,
look at this.

1335
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,290
That's a one arm swing.
So that might be a little harder.

1336
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,220
One 56 pounds.
But that's fine.

1337
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,240
That was a world record when he did.
That was pretty cool.

1338
00:55:19,241 --> 00:55:22,480
Yeah.
This is actually a vice documentary.

1339
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,790
Yeah.
There's a couple of thousand pound

1340
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:26,220
deadlifts too in the world's strongest
man competition.

1341
00:55:26,221 --> 00:55:28,020
They.
There was A.

1342
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:31,950
Eddie Hall did a thousand 26 and then
Brian Shaw that a thousand 21.

1343
00:55:31,951 --> 00:55:36,210
It was just fucking Brendan.
How many of these guys are doing

1344
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:36,991
steroids?
Oh yeah.

1345
00:55:36,991 --> 00:55:38,310
No,
just the world's strongest man.

1346
00:55:38,311 --> 00:55:39,720
I mean that's part of the.

1347
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:43,050
It's part of the sport.
It's 99 percent is part of the sport and

1348
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:44,840
it's part of a bodybuilding,
you know,

1349
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,400
as part of a lot of sports.
In a perfect world,

1350
00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:49,310
I think a lot of the athletes would say,
hey,

1351
00:55:49,311 --> 00:55:51,810
to perfect world there'd be nothing out
there that we could take to get better,

1352
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,580
but that's just not the world we live
in.

1353
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:56,190
Right.
So I think that's kind of the case with

1354
00:55:56,191 --> 00:55:59,880
a lot of art.
There are some guys that are just large

1355
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:02,280
human beings that can handle big,
big amount of weights.

1356
00:56:02,281 --> 00:56:05,610
I mean you've probably seen it in mma
where people just have a different

1357
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:06,340
structure.
You like,

1358
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:10,200
I don't know what that guy is like five,
nine.

1359
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:15,201
He has to cut weight to get the suit to
65 and he's just built like electronic.

1360
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,610
Yeah,
it just doesn't just wrestle somebody

1361
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:21,120
and you can't even grab the risks
because risk is all huge in hands and

1362
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,510
feet are all.
But it's like what the John and Johnson

1363
00:56:24,511 --> 00:56:28,270
and Johnson that we've known him since
he was 22 years old and you know,

1364
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:31,420
we were kind of instrumental in getting
him into wrestling and so when we met

1365
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:31,901
him we're like,
dude,

1366
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:34,750
you're a freak.
Your forearms or the size of my head.

1367
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:39,810
He's got a double sized risks,
risks together and he wears a head band

1368
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:40,720
around his biceps.

1369
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,313
Were like,
hey.

1370
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:47,920
And he got picked up by wwe,
like pretty much right away.

1371
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,660
It was pretty,
pretty easy for him.

1372
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,760
Well,
there's definitely some physical freaks.

1373
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,110
There's definitely some physical for
expression.

1374
00:56:53,111 --> 00:56:54,950
Always wondered like when you see those
strong mankind's,

1375
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:56,350
like there's,
I don't,

1376
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,140
I can't imagine that any of them could
not be on steroids.

1377
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:02,860
I doubt that any of them are probably
cleaned just due to the sheer amount of

1378
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:05,440
weight that they have to weigh and the
sheer amount of weight that they have to

1379
00:57:05,441 --> 00:57:07,720
lift it just wouldn't really make sense
to do it without.

1380
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,740
It doesn't make sense.
You don't want to go in and lose.

1381
00:57:11,741 --> 00:57:12,551
I mean,
that's not the purpose,

1382
00:57:12,551 --> 00:57:13,450
right?
I think,

1383
00:57:13,451 --> 00:57:13,870
uh,
you know,

1384
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:15,180
we talked about this,
like I,

1385
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,890
I'm on,
you know,

1386
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,990
hormone replacement therapy and I think
it's like,

1387
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,090
you know,
talking about prescription thugs and

1388
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:22,560
whatever,
people like,

1389
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,310
well you take hormone replacement
therapy,

1390
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:25,740
but I think about it,
hormones is like,

1391
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,610
it kind of balances me out and a lot of
other areas.

1392
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:30,100
So I don't have to take pills,
you know,

1393
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,620
I don't have to take other drugs.
40th three.

1394
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:36,010
And when did you start taking hormones?
Comprise about.

1395
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,050
Actually right after I had my hips done.
I was 30,

1396
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:42,340
33 or 34 and it was because I had hip
replacement surgery.

1397
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:47,140
So you started hormone replacement to
try to boost your body's recovery?

1398
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:48,520
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1399
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,580
I was doing growth hormone then too and
I felt like the growth hormone wasn't

1400
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:52,450
really worth it.
I don't know.

1401
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,040
I mean a lot of people financially you
mean?

1402
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,600
Yeah,
they have a lot of people rave about it

1403
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:57,190
yet.
But what you get bang for your buck or

1404
00:57:57,191 --> 00:57:57,700
whatever.
I,

1405
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,330
if you're rich.
Yeah,

1406
00:57:59,331 --> 00:58:01,000
it might.
Maybe it'll help you a little bit,

1407
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:03,130
but I don't know if you're trying to get
some crazy results.

1408
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,800
Like what do you mean by like what were
you trying to do is a fan of growth

1409
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:06,130
hormone.

1410
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:08,110
It actually hurt my joints more than
anything.

1411
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:11,920
Anybody hands fall asleep all the time.
A whole lot of water hands fall asleep.

1412
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,280
Yeah.
Take it.

1413
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:14,920
No,
I know everyone says that.

1414
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:16,870
But uh,
it gives you a Dema and everything.

1415
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:19,420
Yeah,
it makes you hold a little bit of water

1416
00:58:19,421 --> 00:58:21,730
I think.
I think at the time I've tried to.

1417
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,430
I use a day and four.
I use a day that's,

1418
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,880
that's not,
that's not much.

1419
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:28,060
That's the big crazy bodybuilder guys
take like 10,

1420
00:58:28,061 --> 00:58:28,894
right?
I,

1421
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,360
if you're using it in conjunction with
everything else,

1422
00:58:31,361 --> 00:58:33,970
like then you'd probably not optimizing
everything.

1423
00:58:33,971 --> 00:58:36,170
It makes sense that it would,
that it would be effective for you,

1424
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,460
but a little bigger.
The major winner.

1425
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,740
I think.
So some people take it and say,

1426
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:42,611
oh my God,
I said,

1427
00:58:42,611 --> 00:58:44,440
growth hormone.
I got completely shredded.

1428
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:46,420
And then it's like,
maybe it's just not the case.

1429
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:48,580
Well,
you know,

1430
00:58:48,581 --> 00:58:51,100
it also could be the now are on growth
hormone.

1431
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:54,130
They really stepped up their training.
They're all excited with her on growth

1432
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:54,964
hormone.
Right.

1433
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:58,270
There's a lot of factors involved.
We think suburbans do for the most part

1434
00:58:58,271 --> 00:59:01,280
to do with supplements.
A little bit of it.

1435
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:02,850
It's going to help you a little bit,
some of them.

1436
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:06,730
And then there's a little bit of placebo
effect if you're taking fish oil and

1437
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,560
chugging down protein powder and stuff
like that,

1438
00:59:08,561 --> 00:59:10,120
you're probably not eating pizza and
drinking beer.

1439
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:13,450
Well that's why double blind placebo
controlled studies are so important to

1440
00:59:13,451 --> 00:59:15,760
find out what actually does work and
what doesn't work.

1441
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:20,761
What are the inflamed inflammation
markers in the blood and fish oil though

1442
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,360
part about that.
Like with uh,

1443
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,560
with certain things like fish oils,
like,

1444
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,240
okay,
is it good for inflammation?

1445
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:27,074
Yes,
probably.

1446
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:30,200
But what people take it for is like,
there a lot of people take it for their

1447
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:31,920
heart health and they realized like,
wow,

1448
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,180
I got to take 12 pills a day for it to
actually be effective for my heart

1449
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:37,840
health where you could get in
tablespoons to.

1450
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:38,770
That's how I do it.
Sure.

1451
00:59:38,771 --> 00:59:39,780
Yeah.
But I'm saying like,

1452
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,340
I guess it's not what I'm saying.
It's like it's not as effective as

1453
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:44,200
people think.
Like,

1454
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,650
oh I to take fish oil,
you know?

1455
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:48,500
And then they go out and they buy pretty
effective,

1456
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:51,080
you know,
a little bit over a really long period

1457
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:52,850
of time is probably the most effective
thing.

1458
00:59:52,851 --> 00:59:55,120
So you've got to stick with it.
It's definitely bad for anybody,

1459
00:59:55,121 --> 00:59:56,570
but I just think that it's like,
you know,

1460
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,880
it's something that uh,
you know,

1461
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:00,380
it's just another thing like maybe you
don't need it,

1462
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:01,071
you know,
well,

1463
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:02,190
what is need,
you know,

1464
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,420
it's your turn to optimize your life.
You've tried to optimize your body

1465
01:00:05,421 --> 01:00:09,530
officially it was a good choice.
But if you want to get the results these

1466
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:11,990
guys are talking about in these studies
and taking 12 pills a day,

1467
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:13,610
you don't really have to take pills.

1468
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:14,990
You can just,
I take it,

1469
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:15,850
I get it.
Um,

1470
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:19,220
it's a company name.
Crawson's crossings and things.

1471
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,180
Yeah.
They've been around forever.

1472
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,030
They're in a bottle and just pour it
into a tablespoon.

1473
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,350
I take a couple of tablespoons.
Yeah.

1474
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,270
It's just so good for you.
It's like flavor,

1475
01:00:26,271 --> 01:00:28,190
like lemon or something that.
A little lemon flavor.

1476
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:32,780
I think just really getting out and
talking about is a,

1477
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:35,270
you're an addict,
you're just expecting it to help improve

1478
01:00:35,271 --> 01:00:36,260
your health,
which is great.

1479
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:39,740
I think a lot of people expect us to do
something to have a heart attack.

1480
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:42,440
If I take two of these a day and then
they realize,

1481
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,910
oh,
the study was done with 12 a day,

1482
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:44,611
you know?
Well,

1483
01:00:44,611 --> 01:00:47,570
they didn't take 12 bitch and step up
your game.

1484
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:50,300
If you want to not have a heart attack,
take a couple of aspirin a day.

1485
01:00:50,301 --> 01:00:51,640
Right?
Isn't that what's supposed to be like

1486
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,110
one of the best things in the world for
your.

1487
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,120
For your heart?
It's supposed to help too.

1488
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:55,954
Yeah.
Allegedly.

1489
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:56,520
One,
one.

1490
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,010
I one to a today.
This is so many different fucking

1491
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:03,020
things.
You have to be on the same time.

1492
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:08,290
Take some part and be 12 and working
well.

1493
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,870
They get you all stressed out about it.
Then you've got to take something for

1494
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:13,460
that.
What are you doing for Niacin?

1495
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:16,950
What do I need to do?
What kind of Nice,

1496
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:19,160
and then you forget to take everything
that you get depressed.

1497
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:21,650
You ever get that shit?
You ever take that Flash Nice and flush?

1498
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:26,120
I take that stuff every night.
It makes your fucking skin turn red and

1499
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,610
you didn't take it at night.
Really good for you.

1500
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:31,220
It makes you go to sleep or just really
that's when I take it,

1501
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:32,720
but it's really good for your body.
You know?

1502
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:35,210
It's one of those things that people
don't like taking because it gives you

1503
01:01:35,211 --> 01:01:39,490
that weird good for your blood
readings,

1504
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,560
but just that effect is temporary.

1505
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:49,430
Although
I take that,

1506
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:52,340
I take it like a man.
You think that flush nice and doesn't.

1507
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:54,200
Doesn't work.
Yeah.

1508
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,520
What are you afraid of?
A little flush.

1509
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:55,890
Yeah.
No,

1510
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:57,720
I'm not scared.
I'm good.

1511
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,450
That's what separates the men from the
boys.

1512
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,510
All that weird feeling.
Afraid of looking like you have poison

1513
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:04,660
ivy or some shit.
My eyes itch.

1514
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:09,230
And did you find that stone at 5:55
stoning and pull that sucker up man.

1515
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,970
I think that's unbelievably.
Is it?

1516
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:15,080
It supplements that you were saying like
it depends on like what people are

1517
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:15,650
expecting.
You know,

1518
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:19,950
a lot of times certain things will rave
about testosterone,

1519
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:21,840
testosterone.
There is no way.

1520
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:25,170
Absolutely zero chance that that
someone's going to work as good as

1521
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:26,730
injecting testosterone.
Well,

1522
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:30,360
if it does,
if it works better than testosterone,

1523
01:02:30,361 --> 01:02:31,750
you're going to fuck your body up.
Yeah,

1524
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,690
yeah.
Maybe it's going to have side effects.

1525
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,110
If there was something out there that
was the cure that they like,

1526
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:39,000
you wouldn't have to advertise.
People will just know about it.

1527
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,520
Well,
here's the most important supplement.

1528
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:45,860
The most important thing that you can
take is really healthy food and when did

1529
01:02:45,861 --> 01:02:47,910
you start throwing down all these
supplements,

1530
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:50,070
but you're eating fucking big MACs.
Your,

1531
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,500
you know,
you can't do that.

1532
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:55,980
I got a friend was telling me like that
all the chemical components of all

1533
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:58,470
really healthy food already exists in
vitamin,

1534
01:02:58,471 --> 01:03:00,630
so just eat whatever the fuck you want.
Take vitamins.

1535
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:01,651
I was like,
man,

1536
01:03:01,651 --> 01:03:04,550
I don't think it works.
I just don't think it works.

1537
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:07,080
It doesn't work like that for me.
That's the problem is people use it as a

1538
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:07,914
safeguard.
Right?

1539
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:10,110
Actually,
the first time I met you,

1540
01:03:10,111 --> 01:03:11,820
it was after one of your shows at the
ice house.

1541
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:12,720
I don't even know if you remember.

1542
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,700
We were outside in the back and you
said,

1543
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:17,640
have you were talking to Brian Callan
and all these other guys and uh,

1544
01:03:17,641 --> 01:03:20,430
you were saying every time we go on the
road I got to go to a whole foods and I

1545
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:24,000
thought that was so cool that you
actually take the time to go out and get

1546
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:25,310
the,
even when you're on the road,

1547
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:27,220
get the right food and like,
that was a,

1548
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,810
that was actually inspirational for me
to hear because you don't have somebody

1549
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:32,370
that struggled with my weight all the
time.

1550
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:35,370
And like sometimes I think that stuff is
weird or people might think I'm weird if

1551
01:03:35,371 --> 01:03:37,550
I'm trying to.
I don't care if you're spending the

1552
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:37,830
night,
you know,

1553
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:39,810
and um,
it's just good to know that like other

1554
01:03:39,811 --> 01:03:43,380
people that are doing it,
why you traveled on the road for so many

1555
01:03:43,381 --> 01:03:44,400
years.
I know there's no.

1556
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:47,640
Unless I stay in a place that has a
really good restaurant and I know they

1557
01:03:47,641 --> 01:03:50,370
have really healthy salads and real
healthy food options.

1558
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:52,200
And,
and even if that's the case,

1559
01:03:52,201 --> 01:03:53,610
what am I going to drink?
I mean,

1560
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,770
it's cool if they have,
you know,

1561
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,040
bottled waters,
cool.

1562
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:59,580
But I drink Kombucha a lot so I was
wanting to make sure that I have enough

1563
01:03:59,581 --> 01:04:03,150
probiotics and I want healthy snacks.
I don't want to have to go through the

1564
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:06,360
fucking minibar and eat peanut m and m's
and all that bullshit.

1565
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,560
Middle of the knife.
I'm hungry.

1566
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,150
It makes you feel bad.
I think,

1567
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,380
you know,
it makes you feel like a loser and I

1568
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:13,230
just,
I mean there's nothing wrong with eating

1569
01:04:13,231 --> 01:04:16,110
shitty food every now and then,
but for the most part,

1570
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:19,990
the base of your diet,
it's fucking gotta be healthy and stay

1571
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,670
on top of it.

1572
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:24,720
God vegetable for the years that I was
going through my addiction stuff,

1573
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:29,670
I just didn't take care of myself at.
All I did was I was 260 pounds and I

1574
01:04:29,671 --> 01:04:32,640
right now the way I today I weighed like
$200 on a dot.

1575
01:04:32,641 --> 01:04:34,560
So that's great.
But that's a big difference.

1576
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:35,790
You know,
there's a big difference.

1577
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,691
I'm fat,
really,

1578
01:04:36,691 --> 01:04:38,910
really fat in that movie and I still
think I have a long way to go.

1579
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,370
You know,
I used to weigh 3:30 and I kinda got up

1580
01:04:41,371 --> 01:04:44,730
there on purpose just to pluck and
gained strength and I went from like

1581
01:04:44,731 --> 01:04:45,870
$300.
Oh,

1582
01:04:45,871 --> 01:04:47,100
here we go.
Brian Shaw,

1583
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,230
555.
World Records,

1584
01:04:49,231 --> 01:04:51,270
stone lift.
Oh my God.

1585
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:54,690
So that's impossible to pick up.
I mean look how big his hands are.

1586
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,430
Boy,
555 pounds.

1587
01:04:59,431 --> 01:05:03,780
And it's a ball,
like it's a size of a large medicine

1588
01:05:03,781 --> 01:05:04,890
ball.
An atlas stone.

1589
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:07,410
Yeah.
It's an object not meant to be lifted,

1590
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:08,790
you know,
it's not like a barbell or anything.

1591
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:11,520
Not really interesting to put it up over
that platform.

1592
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,571
Yeah.
How's he doing this?

1593
01:05:12,571 --> 01:05:14,070
Why is this in slow motion?
So the other way,

1594
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:15,960
but that platform is about as tall as I
am.

1595
01:05:15,961 --> 01:05:17,300
Almost.
Jesus Christ.

1596
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:19,120
That tub.
Is He that big?

1597
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:20,283
He's six.
Eight.

1598
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:21,311
Yeah,
he's huge.

1599
01:05:21,311 --> 01:05:22,990
He uses Christ.
Look at this.

1600
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:28,270
That's probably up to my shoulders.
So it's a big boy right there.

1601
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:31,660
That's an enormous human being.
Whereas slingshot elbow sleeves,

1602
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:36,130
if you noticed the
harmful slingshot and what do you think

1603
01:05:36,131 --> 01:05:39,790
that guy eats in a day?
He eats like about 8,000 calories a day.

1604
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,580
Yeah.
I,

1605
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:42,960
uh,
I had,

1606
01:05:42,961 --> 01:05:43,794
um,
picked up.

1607
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:46,140
I haven't picked up from the airport and
uh,

1608
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,550
and,
and brought to my house by like a limo,

1609
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:52,300
lamb shoulder,
and he took a picture in the limousine

1610
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,400
of him,
uh,

1611
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:57,160
with his wife and the limo and he's
eating salmon out of a fucking thing,

1612
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,880
like container tupperware.

1613
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:01,480
That thing.
The thing about that guy is everything

1614
01:06:01,481 --> 01:06:04,990
is so systematic.
It's amazing to be in his presence

1615
01:06:04,991 --> 01:06:05,890
because he talks about,
yeah,

1616
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:07,780
like he doesn't,
he doesn't eat bad,

1617
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,440
you know,
he doesn't.

1618
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,950
He's on target to just be the world's
strongest man.

1619
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:13,660
He's won it three times and he's going
for for this year,

1620
01:06:13,661 --> 01:06:14,494
right?
Yeah.

1621
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:15,401
Yeah.
And usually he's like,

1622
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:16,360
when are we eating?
And I was like,

1623
01:06:16,361 --> 01:06:18,010
probably like five.
He's like,

1624
01:06:18,011 --> 01:06:18,670
oh,
it's like,

1625
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:20,050
he's like,
it's like almost four.

1626
01:06:20,051 --> 01:06:21,760
He's like,
I should probably sneak in a meal now.

1627
01:06:21,761 --> 01:06:24,550
So He ate before we ate.
But he brought meals already made and

1628
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:25,540
everything was.
You know,

1629
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:27,490
what's interesting,
if you look at his supplements,

1630
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:29,800
he's got this thing,
a diet and supplements.

1631
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:34,450
His meals are not that high in quantity
or in,

1632
01:06:34,451 --> 01:06:37,420
um,
like ounces of protein,

1633
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:42,260
like when you look at what he's eating,
like 14 inch lean beef bodybuilding

1634
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:43,143
magazine.

1635
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:45,010
Okay.
But I mean this is what he's saying,

1636
01:06:45,011 --> 01:06:45,370
right?
Yeah.

1637
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:47,290
Yeah.
Ten Ounces Tilapia.

1638
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:50,800
So he's like,
these are normal size meals,

1639
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:53,110
which you would think a guy that's that
big,

1640
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:54,520
he'd be eating like,
you know,

1641
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:57,430
56 ounce steak.
So you'd really look at it.

1642
01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:59,770
There's almost nine up there.
I think there's pre workout,

1643
01:06:59,771 --> 01:07:01,950
post workout,
which are kind of more like shakes,

1644
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,820
but there's like a pudding in there.
Five,

1645
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:05,020
six,
seven,

1646
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:07,300
eight,
nine,

1647
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,640
10.
It's like 10 different times he's eating

1648
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:11,960
his entire life.
He,

1649
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:14,440
he,
he's obsessed with his entire day is

1650
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,850
driven towards,
you know,

1651
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,890
continue to kick everybody's ass.
Yeah.

1652
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:20,060
But even in that,
like you're,

1653
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:23,800
you're looking at insane amounts of
calories even with the small,

1654
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:24,870
smaller meals.
Right.

1655
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:27,850
What's interesting about him too is that
it's four days of training week and

1656
01:07:27,851 --> 01:07:31,390
three days of full recovery.
So three days he's doing contrast baths

1657
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:33,790
and he's like all the shit that you
always talk about he's doing.

1658
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,580
He goes to,
he goes to a pet place and just as

1659
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,640
physical therapy drills,
you know,

1660
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,500
we saw him get on the floor and he was
doing all kinds of shit.

1661
01:07:41,501 --> 01:07:42,610
We were like,
what the hell?

1662
01:07:42,611 --> 01:07:44,290
How is he moves around like way better
than I do.

1663
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,780
He's moves around.
Great Smart Guy,

1664
01:07:46,781 --> 01:07:47,261
man.
I mean,

1665
01:07:47,261 --> 01:07:50,350
that's really where it's at.
I think there's a lot of people that do

1666
01:07:50,351 --> 01:07:54,160
too much work and not enough recovery
and they just kinda mentally tough their

1667
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:58,210
way through it instead of less work,
more recovery and probably better

1668
01:07:58,211 --> 01:07:59,650
results.
That's where I'm at right now.

1669
01:07:59,651 --> 01:08:02,530
I just fucked up my elbow.
They recommended a what does it.

1670
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,910
PRP injections,
right?

1671
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:06,550
Yeah.
My elbow has been bothering me for a

1672
01:08:06,551 --> 01:08:08,480
little while that's going on with it.
I,

1673
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:10,720
I was training for a competition.
I was uh,

1674
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:15,750
going after a 600 pound bench and I
fucked up my elbow midway through

1675
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:16,160
training.

1676
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,250
I did a 5:55 bench for a double.
That was a big pr for me.

1677
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,720
And then,
um,

1678
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:25,770
through our means personal record for
pb upns.

1679
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:28,340
And so I,
uh,

1680
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,760
got it banged up somehow.
I don't know if it was from that bench

1681
01:08:31,761 --> 01:08:33,290
exactly,
but two or three days later,

1682
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:34,250
you know what,
it started to hurt.

1683
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,980
Um,
I didn't think I was going to be able to

1684
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:38,570
compete,
but I was still able to compete.

1685
01:08:38,571 --> 01:08:42,680
About five or six weeks later,
got a 22 pound bench pr in the meat but

1686
01:08:42,681 --> 01:08:45,560
missed a 600 pound bench.
I did bench five slash 78.

1687
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:48,330
Um,
but when I went to bed 600,

1688
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:51,860
I slightly toward my pack and I think I
tore my peck because my elbow was jacked

1689
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,990
up.
So you just need some time off.

1690
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:54,883
Yeah,
the pack,

1691
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:56,960
clear it up.
Everything's all good with that,

1692
01:08:56,961 --> 01:09:01,961
but the elbow is still all jacked up and
so I just went and got an Mri yesterday,

1693
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:04,250
which was fucking crazy.

1694
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,140
They stuffed me in this little tiny
machine.

1695
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:07,470
Never had one before.
No,

1696
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:09,830
I've never had it before.
I've never had a surgery or nothing.

1697
01:09:09,831 --> 01:09:11,840
I was,
I was a Mris are weird.

1698
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:12,770
Oh,
I was terrified.

1699
01:09:12,771 --> 01:09:15,160
I was in there for like half an hour.
Awesome.

1700
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:17,710
Awesome hammering.
Oh my God.

1701
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,140
After I got out,
I was like,

1702
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,770
just,
I was just like a crazy noises,

1703
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,650
so string,
so claustrophobic.

1704
01:09:24,651 --> 01:09:26,000
I was like,
holy fuck.

1705
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:27,750
That was insane.
But yeah,

1706
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:30,020
now I have to try to figure out.
I have kind of these,

1707
01:09:30,021 --> 01:09:32,180
uh,
they call them chronic tears,

1708
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:36,830
which doesn't really help me at all and
it's all they told me what chronic tears

1709
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:41,540
and tons of inflammation.
So I got to figure out ways to just get

1710
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:44,750
it to heal up on its own basically.
Have you looked into stem cells?

1711
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,930
I haven't tried anything yet.
So when we get out of the podcast,

1712
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,360
I'll give you some stem cells in.

1713
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:57,230
My doctor is actually one of the guys
like leading the way and in stem cells

1714
01:09:57,231 --> 01:10:00,110
and sounds amazing.
They're doing stem cells in Las Vegas

1715
01:10:00,111 --> 01:10:01,940
where they're taking them from woman's
placenta,

1716
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,990
whether it's some into it,
because,

1717
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:07,100
you know,
I can't get in trouble for my wife for.

1718
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:07,731
No,
no,

1719
01:10:07,731 --> 01:10:10,260
no.
Women who have had some Syrian section.

1720
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:12,450
Okay.
So a young girl who has a Sicilian

1721
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:14,630
section,
they take her stem cells,

1722
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:17,120
uh,
out of the placenta and they inject them

1723
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:21,140
directly into your injuries and people
have had fucking spectacular sent into

1724
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:23,110
my elbow.
I'll tell you about their adam done on

1725
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,790
my shoulder.
It's amazing to hear about the

1726
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,890
Wolverine.
Like how many of those do you think?

1727
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:29,690
Hold on a second.
I'm telling you,

1728
01:10:29,691 --> 01:10:33,470
it is probably one of the most
spectacular healing methods you need

1729
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,600
several shots of that.
Or like one shot,

1730
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:36,560
one shot at.

1731
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,620
There was a guy that I'm Arnold
Schwarzenegger I think gave an award to

1732
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,870
last year,
maybe the year before had ocular cancer.

1733
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:43,670
So he couldn't see.
And as I,

1734
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:46,660
and one of his eyes and um,
they did stem cells,

1735
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:51,680
stem cell thing on him and after like 10
weeks he had like full vision of that.

1736
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,030
I don't,
I don't know how,

1737
01:10:53,031 --> 01:10:55,590
I don't know what it was,
but I remember all of the sorts and they

1738
01:10:55,591 --> 01:10:57,200
are giving them a warden talking about
that being,

1739
01:10:57,201 --> 01:10:58,640
you know,
I'm not surprised.

1740
01:10:58,910 --> 01:10:59,930
I'm not surprised.
I mean,

1741
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:04,820
I was fucking stunned at what it did to
my shoulder and I've since had my hip

1742
01:11:04,821 --> 01:11:07,940
done and my knee,
my hip was like barely bothering me.

1743
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:09,440
I'm like,
fucking shoot it up.

1744
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:10,200
Yeah,
you know,

1745
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,650
it just bothered me after hard
kickboxing workouts,

1746
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:14,010
but not,
not even to

1747
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,000
the point where.
But I was like,

1748
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:18,090
listen,
I wouldn't do a damage or is this a good

1749
01:11:18,091 --> 01:11:19,080
thing to do?
Preventative.

1750
01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:20,130
And he's like,
yeah,

1751
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:22,260
probably be a good thing to do.
Preventative for weeks later,

1752
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:24,020
not a fucking single pain no matter how
long.

1753
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:27,030
Shadow over my whole body,
my knee was bothering me.

1754
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:28,980
Well,
it's shown that they can regenerate

1755
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:33,000
cartilage and Manila.
It's insane because it's literally the

1756
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:37,830
building block kind of tissue can
regenerate any tissue,

1757
01:11:37,831 --> 01:11:41,040
like partial tears.
I know some of my meathead friends are

1758
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:44,110
real fans of these like weird peptides.
There's like growth hormone.

1759
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:48,850
Then there's igf one and now there's a
bunch of shit that I can't pronounce any

1760
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:51,180
more,
but it makes your body develop more

1761
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:54,630
growth hormone and testosterone.
And I tried some different things and I,

1762
01:11:54,631 --> 01:11:56,220
I didn't find any of those to be
effective.

1763
01:11:56,221 --> 01:12:01,020
So
you got to say it's a secret.

1764
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,560
So yeah,
we need that guy's number because we're

1765
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:05,940
both ganged up.
I'll help you out.

1766
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:06,990
I'll help you out at the end of the
pocket.

1767
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:09,870
His name is Dr Rodney Mcgee.
If anybody else is listening and he's in

1768
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:12,220
Las Vegas and he's a great guy and
he'll,

1769
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:15,480
he'll take care of you and tell you what
you can and cannot expect out of this.

1770
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:17,430
But they're going to start doing this
all over the world.

1771
01:12:17,431 --> 01:12:21,000
But I believe right now in Vegas is the
only place we can get this stuff that

1772
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:23,460
they're doing through placenta.
I might be wrong about that.

1773
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:24,530
They actually,
they,

1774
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:28,440
they got some to a doctor in New York
that was working on a UFC fighter.

1775
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,720
Chris Weidman actually had to do as nice
to.

1776
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:33,810
My doctor was telling me there's some
way that he was working on that day.

1777
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,990
They could inject $200,
million stem cells and you at one time

1778
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,830
and they basically do it once and it
works in your whole body.

1779
01:12:40,831 --> 01:12:44,400
I don't know how they think about it,
but bas rutten was saying boss route and

1780
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:47,240
had it done.
Me Too.

1781
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:49,970
I don't want to.
I don't want to get kicked up when

1782
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:51,920
fucking great guy anyway.
But uh,

1783
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,580
he had uh,
done intravenously and he was like,

1784
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:55,860
it was like,
there was power coming off my fingers.

1785
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,960
Like I seemed amazing.
He's a great guy.

1786
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,810
He's a spectacular example of a human
being.

1787
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:06,600
Um,
so when you're filming this documentary

1788
01:13:06,601 --> 01:13:09,480
and you're doing this and you know,
you're exposing yourself,

1789
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:12,780
was that one of the harder parts of the
documentary because you know,

1790
01:13:12,781 --> 01:13:17,660
you had to show your car getting all
fucking banged up and I mean for me,

1791
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:18,221
you know,
I,

1792
01:13:18,221 --> 01:13:19,920
I.
Did you take any heat for that because

1793
01:13:19,921 --> 01:13:24,060
you were driving around pilled up and I
got in trouble for that.

1794
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:24,541
Like,
no,

1795
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:26,910
I never,
I never once got pulled over.

1796
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,350
I'd be hammered.
You emitting,

1797
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:33,120
you essentially admitted to a felony.
It's weird.

1798
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:34,620
You can't,
unless it's like murder,

1799
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,630
you can't really get convicted of
anything.

1800
01:13:36,631 --> 01:13:38,310
You're saying like a documentary or a
movie?

1801
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:39,120
Oh really?
Yeah,

1802
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,110
like I could say I never paid my taxes
in 20 years and they can look into it.

1803
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,100
It might be stupid to say it,
but him like,

1804
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:48,030
because we had to check that out.
Like seriously when he was talking about

1805
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,730
taking stuff away.
You're going to be in this fucking

1806
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:51,540
movie.
What did you do?

1807
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,350
What are we doing?
All of our attorneys and everything

1808
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:55,951
like,
oh no,

1809
01:13:55,951 --> 01:13:59,520
like if he says it in documentary
entertainment way to see if ted Cruz

1810
01:13:59,521 --> 01:14:01,600
gets an office will fucking come after
your retroactive.

1811
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:05,280
I think that it's important that you did
that though,

1812
01:14:05,281 --> 01:14:05,731
man.
It was,

1813
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:07,100
it took a lot of balls.
Thank you.

1814
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,680
You said you know,
some of the stuff I recall him saying

1815
01:14:10,681 --> 01:14:12,110
that he was most embarrassed about

1816
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,410
was just like this.
The way he looked,

1817
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:18,760
he cares about being fat and being
bloodshot eyes and like just looking

1818
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:21,190
jacked up.
He was kind of like more depressed about

1819
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:22,390
how,
how that came off,

1820
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:24,010
but he doesn't like watching a movie
probably.

1821
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:25,510
I mean that's kind of some of the stuff
he's told me.

1822
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:28,000
Right.
I've watched it like maybe four or five

1823
01:14:28,001 --> 01:14:30,850
times in its completed form for me to
watch.

1824
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,760
What were you eating that you gained so
much weight?

1825
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:37,810
Did you just like try to like whatever
was kate yourself with food because your

1826
01:14:37,811 --> 01:14:42,280
pain and I actually thought it's funny.
I thought I was like getting bigger and

1827
01:14:42,281 --> 01:14:44,320
getting stronger.
Like I was really strong at that time,

1828
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:46,000
like know,
so I was like fat,

1829
01:14:46,001 --> 01:14:46,930
but yeah,
I could still,

1830
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:50,100
you know,
throw up four or five for like four reps

1831
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:52,840
or whatever,
but then I tore my tricep and that led

1832
01:14:52,841 --> 01:14:55,600
to more depression,
lead to eating bad lead to less,

1833
01:14:55,601 --> 01:14:57,820
working out all sorts of Shit,
you know?

1834
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,520
Well then drinking just causes waking
anyway.

1835
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,481
Yeah,
drinking.

1836
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:04,240
It's like the absolute worst thing for
you is not good.

1837
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:08,980
One of the things that I've noticed from
this diet is I have very little alcohol

1838
01:15:08,981 --> 01:15:10,540
now.
Not that I drank a lot,

1839
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:14,800
but now I'll limit myself to maybe a
glass of wine or two in a night.

1840
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:15,910
At most.
Are you on?

1841
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,740
No carbs,
very little carbs.

1842
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:20,910
He's joined the war on carbs.
You joined the war on carbs,

1843
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,250
carbs,
you guys,

1844
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:28,270
you're going to do a documentary on
ketogenic diets and the owners of quest

1845
01:15:28,271 --> 01:15:32,500
nutrition to have 44 dogs at a farm in
Dallas that have a very,

1846
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:37,030
had a very aggressive form of cancer to
now all cancer free and all they're

1847
01:15:37,031 --> 01:15:39,120
doing is a ketogenic diet.
70 dogs.

1848
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:40,210
Yep.
Seventy percent,

1849
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,280
Quito dogs,
70 percent fat,

1850
01:15:42,281 --> 01:15:45,580
30 percent protein turn into wolves.
They are dogs.

1851
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:46,960
And so that,
the thing is like,

1852
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:49,120
how can we look at that and say,
well,

1853
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:51,930
will this work in humans or what is like
any,

1854
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:55,360
I think any research we're doing on any
animals that are mammals,

1855
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:58,270
you know,
like kind of have similarities so we can

1856
01:15:58,271 --> 01:16:00,370
start figuring things out through these
dogs,

1857
01:16:00,371 --> 01:16:02,050
you know,
because you're not going to experiment

1858
01:16:02,051 --> 01:16:03,310
on people really now.
So,

1859
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,750
and the dog,
it's like,

1860
01:16:04,751 --> 01:16:06,070
Hey,
I'm just trying to save it's life,

1861
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,420
you know?
So,

1862
01:16:07,421 --> 01:16:08,720
um,
what are,

1863
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:11,050
what are their conclusions?
I think that ketogenetic diets,

1864
01:16:11,051 --> 01:16:14,230
I know they think that it's,
they know that it's very effective for

1865
01:16:14,231 --> 01:16:17,160
children that have epilepsy.
So here's what I've heard.

1866
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:19,330
I've also heard the shot down,
so I'm just going to say what I've

1867
01:16:19,331 --> 01:16:21,440
heard,
I've heard that a,

1868
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:24,910
the absence of carbohydrates that have
basically starves the cancer cell.

1869
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,100
I'm not sure if it's that simple,
but that's what I've heard.

1870
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:30,880
What carbohydrates do convert to sugar,
especially simple carbohydrates like

1871
01:16:30,881 --> 01:16:35,800
bread and pasta and sugar does fuel
cancer and I had inflammation in general

1872
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:39,010
in general,
I feel fantastic.

1873
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:43,360
I've only been doing this a month.
This diet is a primal blueprint.

1874
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,490
Ketogenic Diet.
I've only been doing it for a month,

1875
01:16:45,491 --> 01:16:48,610
but my brain is the.
That's when we were talking about before

1876
01:16:48,611 --> 01:16:51,610
the podcast started.
That's probably the most interesting

1877
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:54,190
aspect of it is the mental clarity.
He's got a book,

1878
01:16:54,191 --> 01:16:55,120
right?
Mark Sussan.

1879
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:56,430
He's got a couple of books.
Yeah,

1880
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,610
the primal blueprint and I think I
forget where are they in the other room?

1881
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:01,803
Yeah,
I love.

1882
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,980
I just love reading all that stuff.
You have read every ketogenic diet book.

1883
01:17:05,981 --> 01:17:06,780
There is,
so I'm gonna.

1884
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,170
I'm gonna get that after we get off the
air.

1885
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:10,160
I tried gluten free for awhile.
I did

1886
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,070
that.
I lost weight and I got thinner,

1887
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,470
like my face got thinner,
like my,

1888
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:16,440
I'm one of those guys are like,
my fucking head gets fat.

1889
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:20,110
And so the first thing that happens when
life,

1890
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:25,160
my face gets round in big and this park
it's fact and have abs and have the

1891
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:29,150
fattest face you ever seen the fat face
things a weird thing.

1892
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:31,220
But uh,
that was the first thing that I noticed

1893
01:17:31,221 --> 01:17:35,030
when I did the gluten free.
My face shrank down to normal size and

1894
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:38,390
this is even more so like gluten free is
very,

1895
01:17:38,391 --> 01:17:40,130
uh,
it's very controversial.

1896
01:17:40,131 --> 01:17:41,750
You know,
the guy who came up with the whole

1897
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:44,200
gluten free thing,
published a letter,

1898
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:47,030
published a retraction three years
later,

1899
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,250
says that I lied.
I was wrong.

1900
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:50,630
No gluten free.
Well,

1901
01:17:50,631 --> 01:17:52,360
here's what is definitely like a big
contract,

1902
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:54,430
like big debate over it.
I guess so.

1903
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,910
But here's what it is.
I mean,

1904
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,600
this is why what I decided is one of the
reasons why I stopped being gluten free.

1905
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,100
What it,
what it is,

1906
01:18:01,101 --> 01:18:04,040
is you're taking less sugar.
So that's what the benefit was.

1907
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:06,110
The benefit was I wasn't even eating any
bread,

1908
01:18:06,111 --> 01:18:08,930
I wasn't eating any pasta,
so it was taking in less sugar.

1909
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:11,450
It's really that simple.
So there's less inflammation,

1910
01:18:11,451 --> 01:18:13,670
so I felt better.
So it definitely worked.

1911
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:15,350
Well.
You're adhering to a program that just

1912
01:18:15,351 --> 01:18:17,900
gets rid of some junk.
It's just not a huge.

1913
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,760
What are you eating on the primal
blueprint?

1914
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:23,180
I eat a lot of Avocados.
I'm meeting a lot of healthy fats.

1915
01:18:23,181 --> 01:18:24,014
I take,
you know,

1916
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:27,980
mct oil of take these ketones that you
saw over here.

1917
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:31,640
These things are mixed these into water.
Those are ketones.

1918
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:34,580
I got a stuff,
a kito protein coming out pretty soon.

1919
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,360
I'll send you some.
This is key to genic cream that you put

1920
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:39,890
in coffee.
Mix It in coffee.

1921
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,400
That's a good idea.
I could put exogenous ketones in coffee

1922
01:18:43,401 --> 01:18:44,240
and then there's this,
uh,

1923
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:46,610
this new supplement.
Not a supplement,

1924
01:18:46,611 --> 01:18:51,611
but a snack called phat fudge.
P h a t fudge by.

1925
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:52,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

1926
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:53,840
I want some of that.
Eat,

1927
01:18:53,841 --> 01:18:55,310
play.
Crushed.com.

1928
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,760
There's a woman.
I don't want to fuck up the spelling of

1929
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:00,620
marriage.
Sounds like a great idea.

1930
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:02,010
Oh my gosh.
Oh,

1931
01:19:02,011 --> 01:19:03,810
it's,
it's important to have stuff that's

1932
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:05,870
convenient when you're doing these kinds
of diets.

1933
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,950
You know what I mean?
Stuff that tastes good too,

1934
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:11,030
and you don't want to always be cooking
up fucking pound of meat every five

1935
01:19:11,031 --> 01:19:12,260
minutes.
Exactly.

1936
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:14,600
Well,
luckily I have a lot of meat in the

1937
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:18,410
back.
I've got a lot of elk from the cup of

1938
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,050
elks that are shot,
but you need fats on top of that and a

1939
01:19:21,051 --> 01:19:25,130
lot of that elk is like really a lean
fat to it,

1940
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:25,973
correct?

1941
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:26,511
Well,
no,

1942
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:30,200
you don't add fat to it,
but I mean it's not the same as like say

1943
01:19:30,201 --> 01:19:32,270
if you get,
you know,

1944
01:19:32,271 --> 01:19:36,490
if you got to like a beef steak,
like a rib eye or something like that,

1945
01:19:36,491 --> 01:19:39,230
you're getting a lot of fat,
especially if it's a corn fed.

1946
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:44,000
Beef steak is a lot of fat and so I take
different kinds of fats,

1947
01:19:44,001 --> 01:19:46,610
but avocado is one of the primary ones
that I like.

1948
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:49,580
Ketogenic diets are amazing for a losing
weight,

1949
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:53,140
for a weight class type stuff like
powerlifting,

1950
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:54,710
weightlifting,
mma,

1951
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,690
it works,
works fucking awesome.

1952
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:58,550
You can drop a couple pounds pretty
quickly.

1953
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,000
You've got to wet your body,
really get accustomed to it though,

1954
01:20:02,001 --> 01:20:06,950
because in the beginning people shy off
of it because they feel like losing that

1955
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,980
weight makes them feel

1956
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,980
weak and changing from a carbohydrate
consuming body to approach or to a body.

1957
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,220
Yeah,
it does take time.

1958
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:19,800
You know,
like any cheat day.

1959
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,210
I haven't had anything.
No.

1960
01:20:21,211 --> 01:20:25,020
In the month I have done it.
Just just decide that I don't eat that

1961
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:26,620
anymore.
Well,

1962
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:29,250
I gave myself 60 days.
At the end of six days,

1963
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:32,840
maybe we'll have some ice cream,
but I think I'm going right back on the

1964
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:33,770
ice cream.
Right.

1965
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:34,950
Did that improve ice cream?
Yeah.

1966
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:36,430
Nice.
It's a.

1967
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:40,200
They sell it at Erewhon bulletproof ice
cream and it's like I'm not buying any

1968
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:45,000
bulletproof stuff.
I know that guy kind of carb

1969
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,490
carbohydrates.
I want that guy's just too full of shit

1970
01:20:47,491 --> 01:20:49,350
about too many different things for me
to support it.

1971
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:53,550
The one thing that carbohydrates do is
they help to hydrate carbohydrate,

1972
01:20:53,551 --> 01:20:57,090
helps hydrate the muscles.
So that's what's I think sometimes like

1973
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,460
sometimes people will will say,
oh,

1974
01:20:59,461 --> 01:21:03,960
I don't like Kito Kito Diet because I
feel weak because I lose energy.

1975
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:07,800
If you're doing a Keto diet properly,
you should not be losing any energy.

1976
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:11,340
Your energy level should be fine.
However you're not gonna have as much

1977
01:21:11,341 --> 01:21:14,520
water through your muscles.
And if you're a strength athlete or

1978
01:21:14,521 --> 01:21:17,520
somebody that relies on the strength,
it can be compromised a little bit,

1979
01:21:17,521 --> 01:21:20,450
especially when you start to lose
anything like over like 10 pounds.

1980
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:23,040
So there's going to be calm.
You lose a lot of weight,

1981
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:25,260
your strengths can be compromised,
so you have to make sure that you're

1982
01:21:25,261 --> 01:21:26,980
hydrated.
You have to make sure that you're,

1983
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,060
and you've got to make sure you get
enough,

1984
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:31,800
need some carbohydrates here and there,
you know,

1985
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,810
um,
you know,

1986
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:35,370
Harbert's you don't want,
you don't want high.

1987
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:36,540
That's it.
That's all it is.

1988
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:37,460
And you look at like,
you know,

1989
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:41,550
conor mcgregor going up a weight class
and I know there's different fighters

1990
01:21:41,551 --> 01:21:43,380
and different styles and all the
different things,

1991
01:21:43,381 --> 01:21:46,110
but it is hard to overcome,
uh,

1992
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:47,880
someone just being being bigger than
you.

1993
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:50,760
And so if you lose a bunch of weight,
you should expect to lose some strength.

1994
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,440
Uh,
the girl's name is Marisha,

1995
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:55,380
new to s,
h e n fact,

1996
01:21:55,540 --> 01:22:00,540
putting Paleo chef know phat fudge fat.
Paleo chef.com I think is a.

1997
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:02,730
yeah,
that's a website.

1998
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:03,401
And the,
uh,

1999
01:22:03,401 --> 01:22:07,010
the product's called phat fudge and
hopefully we're going to start selling

2000
01:22:07,011 --> 01:22:09,240
it on it.
It's just buy the whole company.

2001
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:12,290
That sounds nice,
but it's,

2002
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,530
uh,
it's really,

2003
01:22:13,531 --> 01:22:14,520
uh,
it's healthy.

2004
01:22:14,521 --> 01:22:17,630
It's good for you,
but it's a key to genic right?

2005
01:22:18,110 --> 01:22:20,640
The whole idea for me was just to just
give it a try,

2006
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:23,370
just see,
see what it's really like it.

2007
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,353
And so,
um,

2008
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:29,190
it gets me in a mode where I feel like
everything come becomes an order or when

2009
01:22:29,191 --> 01:22:30,940
I'm on like a ketogenic diet for some
reason I'm like,

2010
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,750
I'm not on it right now,
but when I get on it I'm like,

2011
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:35,820
okay,
I know exactly what I need to do exactly

2012
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:36,654
what I need to eat.

2013
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,270
I kind of liked the structure of it,
you know?

2014
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:42,520
And it's not bad.
I mean a lot of people are worried about

2015
01:22:42,521 --> 01:22:42,990
it.
No,

2016
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:44,820
I'm not going to have it.
The only eat carbs.

2017
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:47,250
And when people start panicking and then
they start coming up,

2018
01:22:47,251 --> 01:22:49,130
well I heard that it makes your Dick
fall off.

2019
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,200
Come up with so many different.
So many lies about stupid thing.

2020
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:53,190
Well,
it's not good for you.

2021
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:57,300
It's a day where your brain runs on.
Carbohydrates are bad for me,

2022
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:58,440
you know,
like it's not proven.

2023
01:22:58,450 --> 01:22:59,440
It's good for you.
I'm

2024
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:04,260
guessing just armbar those people can't
do that.

2025
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:06,040
Do you have a day where you throw in any
carbs are

2026
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,000
not really?
No.

2027
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:10,600
Just maybe vegetables and nuts and stuff
like that of that.

2028
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:14,440
But my thought behind it was I just want
to try it,

2029
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:16,930
see what it's like,
trying the exact way it's meant to be.

2030
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:21,990
And what sits in is the idea behind is
not Paleo because that word Paleo

2031
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,880
Lithic,
you know what's kind of messed up

2032
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:27,100
because the Paleolithic era,
people eat breads,

2033
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:29,140
they grains,
they did.

2034
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:32,800
So this is,
he calls it primal and the ideas just

2035
01:23:32,801 --> 01:23:35,920
eat stuff that your body is just really
kind of designed to eat.

2036
01:23:35,921 --> 01:23:39,250
Your body's designed to eat fats,
your body's designed to eat vegetables.

2037
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:43,870
And fats are important because when
people burn fat,

2038
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:46,920
if you don't have those fats,
like if you're not consuming them and

2039
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:50,680
your body starts burning hormone profile
is hugely.

2040
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:52,240
You know,
by fats,

2041
01:23:52,241 --> 01:23:55,930
you know there's a difference between if
your body's designed to burn

2042
01:23:55,931 --> 01:23:57,310
carbohydrates,
carbohydrates,

2043
01:23:57,311 --> 01:23:59,320
if it doesn't have any carbohydrates,
you crash.

2044
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:02,020
So that's the dish.
That's a big difference too.

2045
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,570
Like the feeling that I get in between
meals,

2046
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,190
like I don't get the same kind of
hungry,

2047
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:09,280
like the hungry that I was getting when
I was eating a lot of carbs.

2048
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:10,600
I'll get this off.
Fuck,

2049
01:24:10,601 --> 01:24:12,070
I got to eat now.
I've got to eat out.

2050
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:16,240
I do not get that now.
I don't get that week crashed feeling

2051
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:19,960
like I can get up in the morning after
not having eaten since like 8:00 at

2052
01:24:19,961 --> 01:24:22,240
night.
I'd get up at 9:00 in the morning and

2053
01:24:22,241 --> 01:24:24,660
I'll lift weights and I'm not.
I don't feel weak.

2054
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:25,703
Right.
That's,

2055
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:29,500
that's unusual.
That feels weird to not have the same

2056
01:24:29,501 --> 01:24:33,240
hunger cravings because your body's.
Your body regulates itself better as

2057
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,590
burns off your fat.
I've been doing this for a long time,

2058
01:24:35,591 --> 01:24:40,200
so back in 1995 I moved to California to
go to USC,

2059
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:43,390
started training at Gold's gym in Venice
and started trading with Michael Hern

2060
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:46,120
and this other guy,
ron fed co who's getting his phd.

2061
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,390
Right.
So go to the gym and these guys are a

2062
01:24:48,391 --> 01:24:51,490
lot stronger than me,
their squat and 7,800 pounds and I'm

2063
01:24:51,491 --> 01:24:54,250
around the 600 pound mark and they
basically said,

2064
01:24:54,251 --> 01:24:55,090
hey,
you're too fat.

2065
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:56,530
You got to lose weight.
You got to be.

2066
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:59,840
You can't be competitive.
You've got to drop to next class.

2067
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,660
You need to be in the one nine,
eight weight class.

2068
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:03,520
I'm like,
I have no idea how to do that and I'm

2069
01:25:03,521 --> 01:25:05,170
just a kid from poughkeepsie that moved
out here.

2070
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:07,510
I have no idea what the bodybuilding
lifestyle is about.

2071
01:25:07,511 --> 01:25:08,830
Anything and he said,
look,

2072
01:25:08,831 --> 01:25:12,220
just eat red meat and water until your
account until what?

2073
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,200
Red Meat and water shot.
I did that for.

2074
01:25:14,201 --> 01:25:16,040
I did that for,
I don't know,

2075
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,931
whatever.
I can't.

2076
01:25:16,931 --> 01:25:20,410
When I came back from New York to go
back to school and lift with these guys

2077
01:25:20,411 --> 01:25:24,250
again after the summer,
I think I weighed one 96 and so I came

2078
01:25:24,251 --> 01:25:24,390
back.

2079
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:24,731
It's like,
wow,

2080
01:25:24,731 --> 01:25:27,250
you did it.
And I was kind of stupid.

2081
01:25:27,251 --> 01:25:30,070
Says vegetables were fair game.
He said if you really die and you could

2082
01:25:30,071 --> 01:25:31,720
have like an apple here or there.
But yeah,

2083
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:35,110
it was basically.
But I was naive.

2084
01:25:35,111 --> 01:25:37,080
I didn't know and that was kind of a
good thing for me because I just,

2085
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:40,750
I just dove in headfirst and I didn't
take away your shit's like.

2086
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:44,740
And how often they come out,
every four or five days he lift up a

2087
01:25:44,741 --> 01:25:46,600
manhole cover and just take a shit right
in there.

2088
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,180
It's funny,
I was fine,

2089
01:25:49,181 --> 01:25:52,240
I was stronger and I went into me.
I think I squatted 6:59.

2090
01:25:52,241 --> 01:25:55,990
Why did you stop eating like that?
I just don't think it sustainable

2091
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:56,830
forever.
You know,

2092
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:01,890
I think that's one of the issues that
Quito guy as it gets to be hard to do

2093
01:26:02,051 --> 01:26:04,100
for really,
really long like yours,

2094
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:05,600
I don't know,
it just gets to be tough.

2095
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,780
You mean psychological and you just,
you just run into roadblocks here and

2096
01:26:08,781 --> 01:26:10,340
there and then you get,
you get triggers,

2097
01:26:10,341 --> 01:26:11,180
you know,
for food,

2098
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:13,580
you know,
somebody has fucking birthday and then

2099
01:26:13,581 --> 01:26:16,400
they are eating birthday cake and it
just kind of snowball and you might end

2100
01:26:16,401 --> 01:26:18,920
up into something else or you know,
you might,

2101
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:22,490
depending on what sport you're into,
maybe you have different goals at

2102
01:26:22,491 --> 01:26:25,190
different periods of time.
So sometimes you want to be small and

2103
01:26:25,191 --> 01:26:30,170
sometimes you want to be bigger.
So when you say roadblocks you don't

2104
01:26:30,171 --> 01:26:33,150
mean like you mean more psychological.
Yeah,

2105
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:33,621
yeah,
yeah.

2106
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:34,730
No,
the Diet's fine,

2107
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:38,240
you're not going to like have some sort
of weird blood issue or anything like

2108
01:26:38,241 --> 01:26:40,220
that.
I just think I'm going to give myself a

2109
01:26:40,221 --> 01:26:43,160
cheat day every couple of months.
That's how I think I'm going to do it

2110
01:26:43,450 --> 01:26:45,950
was one day you have an amazing,
uh,

2111
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:46,940
iron will,
you know,

2112
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:47,900
a lot of people don't have that.

2113
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:49,430
It's not that hard,
man.

2114
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:51,830
It's not.
There's kids in Ethiopia right now.

2115
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:53,720
They don't have any feet,
you know what I mean?

2116
01:26:53,721 --> 01:26:54,360
Right now,
like,

2117
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:59,360
how hard is it?
Elk steaks and sauteed Kale and fresh

2118
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:01,950
eggs and Avocados.
It's all great.

2119
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,270
You have your own chickens,
right?

2120
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:07,220
It's all I feel great.
So I'm gonna stick with it.

2121
01:27:07,221 --> 01:27:08,780
I really think this might be the way I
eat.

2122
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:11,600
People are so annoyed with me though
because I talk about it too much.

2123
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,120
I think it's the best way to eat.
We've always,

2124
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:15,110
we've always thought that,
you know,

2125
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:16,040
we have a friend,
uh,

2126
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:19,310
John Anderson who hasn't eaten
carbohydrates and years.

2127
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:20,900
No cars,
no cars.

2128
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:22,050
He's huge.
He has,

2129
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:26,450
well not no carbs as he as he likes to
put it,

2130
01:27:26,451 --> 01:27:28,010
those little motherfuckers are
everywhere.

2131
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:31,880
Carbohydrates are in everything,
but he pretty much despises the act of

2132
01:27:31,881 --> 01:27:35,120
like actually sitting down and eating
like rice or eating potatoes.

2133
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,680
Really huge.
So good.

2134
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:38,690
He used to do,
I know he used to do strong man

2135
01:27:38,691 --> 01:27:41,810
competitions and he said we did strong
man competitions.

2136
01:27:41,811 --> 01:27:44,720
The turnover rate from going from one
event to the next.

2137
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,610
He had to eat carbohydrates,
you know,

2138
01:27:46,611 --> 01:27:49,910
but he,
he said that once he retired from strong

2139
01:27:49,911 --> 01:27:52,520
man,
he were strength wasn't his main focus

2140
01:27:52,521 --> 01:27:53,151
anymore.
He's like,

2141
01:27:53,151 --> 01:27:56,030
I get rid of all that shit and I just
basically just eat meat and vegetables

2142
01:27:56,050 --> 01:28:00,140
and like bodybuilding diet.
They have a lot of carbohydrates in it

2143
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:02,480
and they stuffed themselves to put on
weight.

2144
01:28:02,481 --> 01:28:05,120
So.
And John Anderson continue to get bigger

2145
01:28:05,121 --> 01:28:07,010
and stronger.
You're not gonna you're not gonna.

2146
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:10,520
I don't think you can win like Mr
Olympia without carbohydrates because I

2147
01:28:10,521 --> 01:28:13,850
think there's a whole thing to the,
the hormones of the insulation and

2148
01:28:13,851 --> 01:28:16,190
everything.
It's a whole thing is way too

2149
01:28:16,191 --> 01:28:19,340
complicated for me to understand,
but I just don't think you can.

2150
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:23,240
I think you're limited whenever you
limit any macro macronutrient,

2151
01:28:23,241 --> 01:28:24,940
then you're going to have some
limitations probably,

2152
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,180
you know?
Yeah.

2153
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:29,840
It's interesting.
It's an interesting situation where

2154
01:28:29,841 --> 01:28:33,440
you're trying to figure out what's the
best stuff to put into your body to get

2155
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:35,540
the best performance and the best
feeling out of it.

2156
01:28:35,541 --> 01:28:38,530
And then you factor in convenience,
you know,

2157
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:42,380
social things,
customer things like someone actually

2158
01:28:42,381 --> 01:28:45,430
doing like a know mma,
like a competitor.

2159
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:47,510
It,
it'd probably be a mistake to completely

2160
01:28:47,511 --> 01:28:48,860
get rid of the carbohydrates.
Just,

2161
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:52,160
you know,
I guess the main question would be um,

2162
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,040
if it's to lose weight to get to the
next weight class and it would be

2163
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:56,660
something that you do for a period of
time,

2164
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:59,810
but if other athletes are successful
with the carbohydrates in there,

2165
01:28:59,811 --> 01:29:02,070
why wouldn't you just utilize.
Some guys have gone

2166
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,870
Vegan.
They try to go Vegan to lose weight.

2167
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,430
Oh,
by the way,

2168
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:09,750
all you vegan that keep telling me don't
say it.

2169
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:13,470
Don't say it.
To keep tweeting me and instagram me

2170
01:29:13,471 --> 01:29:15,600
about Nate Diaz.
He's not Vegan,

2171
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:18,040
so stop.
Just cut the shit.

2172
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:18,860
Mercedes.
Vegan.

2173
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:20,700
Yeah.
These vegans went crazy.

2174
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:23,970
Does it feel to know a Vegan is the best
fighter in the world?

2175
01:29:23,971 --> 01:29:27,360
You got beat by a Vegan and the v.
they're all jumped on the Vegan bag.

2176
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,530
He eats fish.
You Fox.

2177
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:30,250
He eats eggs.
You need search.

2178
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:34,440
He likes green plants.
It's good for you.

2179
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,030
Look,
green plants are very good for you,

2180
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:40,230
but you say that in your comedy cult
attached to these people.

2181
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,610
They're so unbelievably proselytizing.
They're just ridiculous.

2182
01:29:44,611 --> 01:29:47,520
What they don't realize too is if I have
friends that are Vegan and they never

2183
01:29:47,521 --> 01:29:49,710
talk about it,
they never pushed it on me and I'm

2184
01:29:49,711 --> 01:29:51,330
actually interested in finding out why
they,

2185
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,830
why they want to do that.

2186
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:54,180
Right.
So I asked them about it.

2187
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:55,860
I don't,
but they're not pushing it down my

2188
01:29:55,861 --> 01:29:56,430
throat.
You know,

2189
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:59,850
most of what nate eats is raw.
He eats a lot of raw foods and you did

2190
01:29:59,851 --> 01:30:02,090
that for a long time and he tried raw
vegan for awhile,

2191
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:06,150
but he felt like he needed to substitute
it with chicken or with a fish,

2192
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:09,780
so he doesn't need any land animals.
But he does eat eggs,

2193
01:30:09,781 --> 01:30:10,680
I believe.
Pretty sure.

2194
01:30:10,681 --> 01:30:13,680
I know he eats breads.
I've seen him eat like tacos and shit.

2195
01:30:13,681 --> 01:30:16,590
So He's eating tortillas.
He was fucking awesome in that fight.

2196
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:18,870
A bad motherfucker.
And the reason why he won,

2197
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:20,640
by the way,
it's not because he's a fucking Vegan.

2198
01:30:20,641 --> 01:30:24,000
You assholes.
He's healthy and he's got very good

2199
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:26,490
endurance,
got a really good endurance base and

2200
01:30:26,491 --> 01:30:28,200
he's a.
he's a really good boxer man.

2201
01:30:28,201 --> 01:30:31,170
His boxing is nasty and his Jujitsu is
top notch.

2202
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:33,810
Nate Diaz has been around for a long
time.

2203
01:30:33,811 --> 01:30:38,100
He's 20 some odd fights in the UFC
motherfucker and all you vegan folks.

2204
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:40,110
I'm not mad at you.
I'm not honestly.

2205
01:30:40,111 --> 01:30:42,000
It's just you got to understand that,
that,

2206
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:45,990
that thing that you guys do where you go
after people and you,

2207
01:30:45,991 --> 01:30:50,991
you fucking insult them and it just
makes people more reluctant to associate

2208
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:53,220
with you.
To want to be a Vegan,

2209
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:56,970
it makes people more with locked and it
makes me peep people.

2210
01:30:56,971 --> 01:30:59,940
Let's think you're ridiculous.
You're in a cult.

2211
01:30:59,950 --> 01:31:03,630
They're looking to religion and they're
like trying to get other people to

2212
01:31:03,631 --> 01:31:06,230
actively join.
Why are you shooting deer?

2213
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:07,770
Have a dog as a pet.
It's like,

2214
01:31:07,771 --> 01:31:08,461
well,
let's just fucking.

2215
01:31:08,461 --> 01:31:09,390
What's acceptable,
man?

2216
01:31:09,391 --> 01:31:10,051
I don't know.
Well,

2217
01:31:10,051 --> 01:31:11,670
it's not just that.
If you don't shoot deer,

2218
01:31:11,671 --> 01:31:13,410
you dummies.
They fucking overpopulate.

2219
01:31:13,411 --> 01:31:15,130
Unless you want to bring in wolves,
right?

2220
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:19,250
There's nothing out there stopping deer
from fucking and making you guys.

2221
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:24,350
You have this delusional fairytale,
Walt Disney i's view of wildlife and

2222
01:31:24,751 --> 01:31:29,751
it's been a really uncomfortable fucking
discussion that you guys don't want to

2223
01:31:30,061 --> 01:31:31,980
have because if you do have it,
you're gonna.

2224
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:36,000
You're gonna wind up feeling really
fucking stupid because there's a reality

2225
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:39,060
there.
They're killing hundreds of bison in

2226
01:31:39,061 --> 01:31:41,400
yellowstone park right now.
They're going to fucking shoot him.

2227
01:31:41,401 --> 01:31:42,990
You know why?
Because there's no hunting because

2228
01:31:42,991 --> 01:31:44,940
there's too many of them.
You know they're going to have to.

2229
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:46,750
They're gonna Start Shooting grizzly
bears to.

2230
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:49,110
Why?
Because there's too fucking many of

2231
01:31:49,111 --> 01:31:49,411
them.
They,

2232
01:31:49,411 --> 01:31:49,980
they,
they,

2233
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:53,010
you,
if something's got to kill them and it's

2234
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:57,090
you gotta bring in Predators or you're
going to have overpopulation problem did

2235
01:31:57,210 --> 01:31:57,960
that.
People,

2236
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,250
people with the most over populated
thing on the planet.

2237
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,720
Well then don't fuck.

2238
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,060
Stop fucking around.
Stop having babies.

2239
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:05,050
Shut your mouth.
You know,

2240
01:32:05,051 --> 01:32:09,430
it's the whole thing is preposterous,
but it was amazing the next day,

2241
01:32:09,431 --> 01:32:14,140
the amount of fucking tweets from vegans
that were so excited that a Vegan one.

2242
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,530
This auto stop them.
Stop on this speech.

2243
01:32:17,531 --> 01:32:18,180
No,
I'm kidding.

2244
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:20,740
They're going to go extra hard.
That's hilarious.

2245
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:22,150
It's amazing.
Well,

2246
01:32:22,151 --> 01:32:22,984
they're just,
they're,

2247
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:24,280
they're,
they're in a cult.

2248
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:29,810
It's a cult of vegetables and they think
that that had gone Vegan or vegetarian,

2249
01:32:31,211 --> 01:32:35,440
like a Rob Wolf who wrote that Paleo
Book and he does not Hardcore Paleo but

2250
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:37,990
a,
he got very sick,

2251
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:38,561
you know,
from it.

2252
01:32:38,561 --> 01:32:39,820
I,
I hear that all the time.

2253
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:41,650
Like I went Vegan,
Vegan,

2254
01:32:41,651 --> 01:32:44,080
I got really sick and I actually,
when I was in Rehab,

2255
01:32:44,081 --> 01:32:46,390
there's a kid that was Vegan.
He was eating Oreos all the time.

2256
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:47,860
I'm like,
that's so gross.

2257
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:50,500
Like,
why are you going about their Vegan?

2258
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:50,921
I'm like,
yeah,

2259
01:32:50,921 --> 01:32:53,310
but you're not a real vegan.
That's like bullshit Vegan,

2260
01:32:53,311 --> 01:32:53,781
you know?
Well,

2261
01:32:53,781 --> 01:32:55,990
it's Vegan,
but it's Shitty for you.

2262
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:59,800
There's a lot of gummy bears.
Gummy bears are actually gelatin.

2263
01:32:59,801 --> 01:33:02,620
It's probably not Vegan,
but there's some gummy bears are great.

2264
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:04,810
Just don't eat the whole thing.
Like you said in your set.

2265
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,700
Oh that's,
that's a different kind of gummy bear.

2266
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:10,360
That was true.
And you're like,

2267
01:33:10,361 --> 01:33:13,000
why do they fucking sell it that way?
Then dude,

2268
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:14,170
only eat the head.
Why?

2269
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:19,171
What's going to happen?
It's true story for me to hear that kind

2270
01:33:19,211 --> 01:33:20,800
of stuff.
I don't know anything about that world.

2271
01:33:20,801 --> 01:33:23,410
It's so cool for me to hear about that
kind of stuff because I don't know

2272
01:33:23,411 --> 01:33:25,720
anything about any of these kinds of
drugs,

2273
01:33:25,721 --> 01:33:29,560
so I'm just like amazing.
Edible pot is a motherfucker man.

2274
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:33,400
Real careful.
But you can be healthy on a Vegan Diet.

2275
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,830
You just have to be careful and you have
to supplement and you might have to

2276
01:33:35,831 --> 01:33:38,260
supplement with vitamin B 12,
which comes from animals.

2277
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:40,090
Yeah,
and I know people that are on Vegan

2278
01:33:40,091 --> 01:33:41,350
diets that are also very healthy,
you know,

2279
01:33:41,351 --> 01:33:43,480
but yeah,
they're doing it the right way.

2280
01:33:43,481 --> 01:33:48,100
I guess it's got to be diligent and
there's also biodiversity where some

2281
01:33:48,101 --> 01:33:50,380
people works better than it does for
other people.

2282
01:33:50,381 --> 01:33:53,770
I know John fits try a Vegan diet for
awhile and it helped him for a little

2283
01:33:53,771 --> 01:33:56,770
while,
but then after awhile he just felt weak.

2284
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,650
Like initially it helped him a lot.
Like you felt like you had more

2285
01:33:59,651 --> 01:34:02,890
endurance and he felt healthier but
slowly but surely he felt weaker and

2286
01:34:02,891 --> 01:34:07,891
weaker and then he just didn't feel like
he could compete at one 70 without

2287
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:10,480
eating some sort of animal protein.
But you know,

2288
01:34:10,481 --> 01:34:13,810
you can get animal protein if you're
worried about the ethical consequences

2289
01:34:13,811 --> 01:34:14,644
of it.

2290
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:17,470
You could,
you could get it from eggs and you don't

2291
01:34:17,471 --> 01:34:19,630
have to hurt anybody.
Like I have eggs,

2292
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:21,370
these chickens there,
their pets.

2293
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:22,960
I could walk up to them and pick them
up,

2294
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:24,280
you know,
and they're not,

2295
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:25,750
they're not going to harm.
They're not.

2296
01:34:25,751 --> 01:34:29,080
There's no factory farms situation.
If you have a backyard you can have

2297
01:34:29,081 --> 01:34:30,370
that.
And they free range,

2298
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:32,650
they walk around,
you know you're going to have to deal

2299
01:34:32,651 --> 01:34:36,580
with the fact they eat bugs and if you
see something that says vegetarian fed

2300
01:34:36,581 --> 01:34:38,590
chickens with those poor fucking
chickens,

2301
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:41,620
it's not their idea they want,
they want to eat everything.

2302
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:44,080
Those are the motherfuckers really.
I fed him a mouse wants,

2303
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:49,450
oh my God.
That episode where they're seeing my

2304
01:34:49,451 --> 01:34:53,940
kids weren't there for the finale.
Chicken sacrifice will.

2305
01:34:53,950 --> 01:34:58,490
So it was sort of highlights how crazy
people are when it comes to animals in

2306
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:01,400
the hierarchy of what's okay to live and
what's okay to die.

2307
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:06,530
We bought these pinkies for a hawk,
a hawk flew into a window and got

2308
01:35:06,531 --> 01:35:10,550
knocked the fuck out and hurt its wing.
And so we had to bring the Hawk to one

2309
01:35:10,551 --> 01:35:13,310
of those wildlife rescue places.
And so in the meantime,

2310
01:35:13,311 --> 01:35:15,860
this poor hawke was with us for a day
over the weekend.

2311
01:35:15,861 --> 01:35:19,380
We got to get some food.
So my family went to pet food,

2312
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:21,920
stop and got these pinkies.
These mice,

2313
01:35:21,921 --> 01:35:25,010
they feed to snakes and they're like
basically the little babies,

2314
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,560
it's kind of fucked up and you feed them
to the Hawk and that's what kept the

2315
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:30,410
Hawk alive while we had them and
everybody's happy like,

2316
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:32,160
oh,
the hawks still okie dokie amount,

2317
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,880
but then there was this one mouse left.
My wife,

2318
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,620
my daughter wanted to keep it as a pet.
I'm like,

2319
01:35:36,621 --> 01:35:39,230
you can't like this.
It's going to die like it doesn't have

2320
01:35:39,231 --> 01:35:40,064
its mom.

2321
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:44,270
It needs to be fed.
And so I decided to feed to the chicken.

2322
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:45,620
They were crying.
No,

2323
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:48,520
don't do it like,
but you've fed it to a hawk regular.

2324
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:51,500
Forgive you,
but the moment that thing touched down

2325
01:35:51,501 --> 01:35:54,440
those fucking chickens mold that.
Those little dinosaurs.

2326
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:55,461
They're monsters.
Yeah.

2327
01:35:55,461 --> 01:35:57,830
My inlaws have chickens and yellow kind
of eat whatever.

2328
01:35:57,950 --> 01:36:00,080
Anything put in front of them.
Killed a mouse.

2329
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,120
An actual mouse too.
Not a Pinky,

2330
01:36:02,121 --> 01:36:04,550
but in a mouse mouse that got into the
cage.

2331
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:06,530
The amount.
They have a big chicken coop.

2332
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:09,590
They get attacked by themselves.
You lose some of them here and there.

2333
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:12,010
No,
they fuck each other up the package.

2334
01:36:12,610 --> 01:36:16,730
They fucking did decide to start chats
going on in their brains.

2335
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:21,410
My dog killed a couple of them.
Unfortunately in a coyote got one.

2336
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:24,020
One
that happens quite a bit.

2337
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:25,600
It does happen.
But uh,

2338
01:36:25,670 --> 01:36:27,020
they fucking kill everything.

2339
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:29,630
Just chickens.
They will fucking kill anything that's

2340
01:36:29,631 --> 01:36:32,820
small.
Like they packed my daughter and my wife

2341
01:36:32,821 --> 01:36:33,441
was like,
well,

2342
01:36:33,441 --> 01:36:35,030
they're just dumb.
They don't know any better.

2343
01:36:35,031 --> 01:36:35,511
I go,
no,

2344
01:36:35,511 --> 01:36:37,880
they're trying to eat her.
You just can't fucking eat.

2345
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:39,230
Are you crazy?
She's little.

2346
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:42,410
They're trying to figure out if she's a
little enough for them to eat the

2347
01:36:42,411 --> 01:36:46,790
fucking little dinosaurs.
After I saw after I heard that episode

2348
01:36:46,791 --> 01:36:49,190
and you talk about,
I had my girlfriend listening because

2349
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:50,060
she loves chicken,
you know,

2350
01:36:50,061 --> 01:36:53,540
like the think it's so much healthier
cleaner than anything else.

2351
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:54,540
And I'm like,
let's listen.

2352
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:55,560
I listen to this shit.
Yeah,

2353
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:57,110
Kinda messed her up a little bit.
Well,

2354
01:36:57,111 --> 01:37:00,520
chicken is healthy.
Just when you hear that you're kind of

2355
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:01,580
like taken aback,
you know,

2356
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:05,850
I just look factory farming,
I think everybody can agree is a monster

2357
01:37:05,851 --> 01:37:07,670
is side effect of civilization.

2358
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,140
It's horrific and that's what's really
wrong with the way we get our food

2359
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:14,300
stuffs so many.
I'm going to Keith and all that kind of

2360
01:37:14,301 --> 01:37:15,980
stuff.
He had a documentary food inc.

2361
01:37:15,981 --> 01:37:16,770
Have you seen it?
Yes.

2362
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:17,780
Great documentary.
YeaH,

2363
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:19,770
it's amazing.
It's amazing.

2364
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:20,240
That's,
that's,

2365
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,620
that's the darkness,
you know,

2366
01:37:21,621 --> 01:37:25,040
and if you feel better,
have not from not consuming animals,

2367
01:37:25,041 --> 01:37:27,470
good for you.
The problem is not those people.

2368
01:37:27,471 --> 01:37:31,040
The problem is those people that are
aggressively do she to anyone who eats

2369
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:32,480
meat,
they just,

2370
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:34,550
oh my god,
I get them on my troll them now.

2371
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:39,380
I put hashtag vegan meat dishes when I
cook.

2372
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:42,750
Anything that hasn't even started
hashtagging that.

2373
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:44,450
Well,
you can just say you're vegan for

2374
01:37:44,451 --> 01:37:46,930
certain meals too,
because I see you post stuff on salad.

2375
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:50,080
Write vegan meal.
Well,

2376
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:54,500
most of my breakfast,
most of the time eating eggs.

2377
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:58,530
I'm eating vegan.
That's not how they take it.

2378
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:01,590
You're either you're either in or you're
out of the club.

2379
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:06,840
Either you're in or in the way.
Now I understand their motivation.

2380
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:10,770
I just think the way they go about it is
so wrong and it turns people off.

2381
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:14,860
It's like the people that are against
for throwing paint on people with,

2382
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,300
I guess not going to stop it.
It's going to make somebody mad.

2383
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:18,163
That's it.

2384
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:23,450
A lot of those animals that they get
from our clients about that.

2385
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:27,470
Martin ever received the video.
We showed that video last week of the

2386
01:38:27,471 --> 01:38:31,400
martin chasing down the rabbit hole.
Just martin.

2387
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,660
I didn't even know what a martin was
until I watched those shows.

2388
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,280
You ever see those shows like the last
thing,

2389
01:38:37,281 --> 01:38:39,650
guys that live in the mountains for
trapping and shit.

2390
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:44,810
A martin is like this little weasel and
it's not any bigger than a rabbit and

2391
01:38:44,811 --> 01:38:47,960
this rabbits running and the martins
running after it and they're filming it

2392
01:38:47,961 --> 01:38:51,020
on this snowy road and it's a long
chase.

2393
01:38:51,021 --> 01:38:52,260
I mean like hundreds and hundreds of
year.

2394
01:38:52,261 --> 01:38:52,641
I.
Here it is.

2395
01:38:52,641 --> 01:38:53,810
Look at this.
Look at this.

2396
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,600
Look at that little fucker.
Shit.

2397
01:38:56,990 --> 01:38:59,420
Yeah.
He's hauling ass and he's chasing after

2398
01:38:59,421 --> 01:39:02,420
this rabbit rabbit is up ahead of them.
What is the name of this video?

2399
01:39:02,421 --> 01:39:04,310
If somebodY wants to watch,
if they're listening to this podcast,

2400
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:09,110
it says martin chasing down rabbit.
I put it on my twitter a lonG time ago.

2401
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:10,551
Whoa.
This shit.

2402
01:39:10,551 --> 01:39:13,400
And this is like halfway into the video.
Jamie did it in the middle.

2403
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:18,200
What are they filming in iphone?
The rabbit goes off snowmobilers no was

2404
01:39:18,201 --> 01:39:20,780
a car.
A rabbit goes off into the side and they

2405
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:21,230
go,
no,

2406
01:39:21,230 --> 01:39:22,063
motherfucker grabs them.

2407
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:24,870
Damn.
But look,

2408
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:28,380
they're the same size.
The rabbit is even actually bigger than

2409
01:39:28,381 --> 01:39:32,220
the martin,
but he jackson with his face then drags

2410
01:39:32,221 --> 01:39:36,510
them out loud and that's what they make
for coats out of those guys.

2411
01:39:36,511 --> 01:39:40,290
That's a big one for fur trappers.
Not that there's anYthing wrong with the

2412
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:41,700
martin did.
That's what they do.

2413
01:39:41,701 --> 01:39:43,560
That's how they live.
Just a mean bastard.

2414
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:47,460
That's all.
So we get by.

2415
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:49,260
Yeah,
it's hard out there for a pimp.

2416
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:52,040
Cold as fuck with a lift,
you know,

2417
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:54,540
living up there in Alaska.
Um,

2418
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:56,900
what,
what does the w.

2419
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:59,400
Did you get any conclusions out of doing
this documentary?

2420
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:00,680
I mean,
is there anything that you,

2421
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:02,730
you got out of it where you,
like,

2422
01:40:02,731 --> 01:40:04,260
you think that it's important for people
to know?

2423
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:04,691
Yeah,
I mean,

2424
01:40:04,691 --> 01:40:05,950
I,
I've learned a lot myself.

2425
01:40:05,951 --> 01:40:08,710
I,
I think the number one thing that I've

2426
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:10,330
learned,
it's very simple,

2427
01:40:10,331 --> 01:40:12,760
like I,
I'm not educated enough or have enough

2428
01:40:12,761 --> 01:40:16,120
experience to really save anybody.
I think anybody out there that has a

2429
01:40:16,121 --> 01:40:19,320
friend or a family member struggling
with drugs or alcohol,

2430
01:40:19,321 --> 01:40:21,790
that the number one thing that you can
constantly do is drive them towards

2431
01:40:21,791 --> 01:40:23,530
getting help,
whatever that is,

2432
01:40:23,531 --> 01:40:27,100
whether it's going to aa meetings,
whether it's going to get a rehab or

2433
01:40:27,101 --> 01:40:29,920
whatever,
just make them aware that they need

2434
01:40:29,921 --> 01:40:31,630
help.
They might not even know driving them

2435
01:40:31,631 --> 01:40:35,470
towards getting help because it's like
the most important thing that you can

2436
01:40:35,471 --> 01:40:35,920
do,
you know,

2437
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:36,790
and I think that,
um,

2438
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:38,800
you know,
a lot of people will talk shit about aaa

2439
01:40:38,801 --> 01:40:40,690
and say it doesn't work,
but I've seen it work.

2440
01:40:40,691 --> 01:40:45,490
I've seen every saturday morning in a,
down in the palisades,

2441
01:40:45,491 --> 01:40:48,260
there's a meeting,
there's like 200 guys in there and a lot

2442
01:40:48,261 --> 01:40:50,040
of people have been sober for 30 years,
you know,

2443
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:52,900
so they're still going to meetings and
they're still helping people and it's a

2444
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:53,973
community.

2445
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,650
So,
uh,

2446
01:40:54,650 --> 01:40:55,950
that's kind of a part of it too,
right?

2447
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:59,710
Not the money community of sober people,
you don't want to disappoint the other

2448
01:40:59,711 --> 01:41:02,680
people in the community.
The people I've met in a or some of my

2449
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:04,300
best friends,
they're like the best,

2450
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:05,430
you know,
like they're all,

2451
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:06,880
everybody's trying to do good and you
know,

2452
01:41:06,881 --> 01:41:10,150
like they've maybe messed up in the past
and we feel bad about it now.

2453
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:12,910
Everything we do is geared towards
trying to help people and do good.

2454
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:15,490
Jimmy,
did you pull up anything on ibogaine or

2455
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:18,460
ibogaine works?
Found a couple of stories but they

2456
01:41:18,461 --> 01:41:19,850
weren't really.
I didn't find like,

2457
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:20,960
how do you spell it?
Ibo.

2458
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:26,110
G I b o g a I n e I think I'm going to
say something to the court tomorrow and

2459
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:33,190
I'll just say something.
Just to contrast them a little bit is

2460
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:35,800
you don't need to be an expert to help
somebody,

2461
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:37,390
you know,
you can help somebody,

2462
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:39,580
you know,
like he's saying drive them towards,

2463
01:41:39,581 --> 01:41:40,470
you know,
making,

2464
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:41,680
making sure they're getting help.

2465
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:45,880
That was a kind of an issue with him.
And also an issue with my oldest brother

2466
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,430
is a.
Especially with my oldest brother,

2467
01:41:48,510 --> 01:41:51,100
I kind of felt like I don't,
I don't know anything about like all

2468
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:53,680
this addiction stuff,
I don't understand.

2469
01:41:53,681 --> 01:41:56,170
He's like bipolar,
but I don't know if he's bipolar and the

2470
01:41:56,171 --> 01:41:59,750
ups and downs or because of the drugs or
a combination thereof.

2471
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:03,400
I don't know what the hell is going on,
so almost felt defeated in a way and

2472
01:42:03,401 --> 01:42:06,880
then anyone out there listening that has
dealt with addicts before.

2473
01:42:06,881 --> 01:42:11,770
You get burned by them so many times
that it just leaves you with a sour

2474
01:42:11,771 --> 01:42:15,100
taste in your mouth and you.
You don't even really want to help to a

2475
01:42:15,101 --> 01:42:17,200
certain point,
but you have to help.

2476
01:42:17,201 --> 01:42:20,560
You have to continue to reach out.
You have to realize that it's not the

2477
01:42:20,561 --> 01:42:23,800
person it is becoming a different person
over a period of time.

2478
01:42:24,130 --> 01:42:27,370
They're not the same person that they
once were and you have to try to help

2479
01:42:27,371 --> 01:42:30,640
them and you don't need to be an expert.
You don't need to know shIt about

2480
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:33,010
addiction.
All you need to know is that they need

2481
01:42:33,011 --> 01:42:36,790
to get help and that a lot of the stuff
that's happening and you'll kind of hear

2482
01:42:36,791 --> 01:42:39,610
them say it over and over again.
They blame stuff on other people all the

2483
01:42:39,611 --> 01:42:40,690
time.
Um,

2484
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,580
it's not really their fault.
They don't,

2485
01:42:42,581 --> 01:42:45,790
they literally don't have control
anymore and I don't want to make excuses

2486
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:48,610
for people,
but that's the predicament that they get

2487
01:42:48,611 --> 01:42:51,640
and that's a predicament my oldest
brother was in and we weren't able to

2488
01:42:51,641 --> 01:42:53,740
pull him out of it.
And that's a predicament that he was in

2489
01:42:53,741 --> 01:42:56,020
and were able to,
are able to save his life.

2490
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:59,560
It was one of the things you brought up
in the documentary is bipolar and the

2491
01:42:59,561 --> 01:43:04,561
diagnosis for bipolar and how many more
people are diagnosed at three percent in

2492
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:08,380
10 years or something like that.

2493
01:43:08,420 --> 01:43:13,090
And what is the excuse of for that?
Is that they didn't know before or is it

2494
01:43:13,091 --> 01:43:14,750
just that they're trying to sell people
medicare?

2495
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:17,200
Yeah,
they're trying to sell people on stuff

2496
01:43:17,290 --> 01:43:19,270
that happened with like adderall and
ritalin as well.

2497
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:23,560
I think that like bipolar is definitely
a real thing and it's a lot.

2498
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:26,200
I think it's like real bipolar is a lot
more rare than,

2499
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:30,010
than is being diagnosed.
So when I say what is bipolar exactly

2500
01:43:30,011 --> 01:43:30,844
mean,
like what?

2501
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:33,460
You're at different polls like,
uh,

2502
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:34,260
you're,
you're,

2503
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:36,920
you're a one one time,
you know,

2504
01:43:36,930 --> 01:43:39,580
you're really happy and hey,
it's so great to see it another time.

2505
01:43:39,581 --> 01:43:40,750
You're an asshole,
you know?

2506
01:43:40,751 --> 01:43:44,200
So it's,
it's just both opposite ends of the

2507
01:43:44,201 --> 01:43:46,450
spectrum.
We kind of ironic because that's how

2508
01:43:46,451 --> 01:43:47,350
we're addicts are.
Yeah.

2509
01:43:47,351 --> 01:43:49,710
And we all have that anyway.
Like we all have a little bit of like,

2510
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:50,910
hey,
I'm really happy with the.

2511
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:52,040
And I'm.
They wouldn't

2512
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:55,190
treat our brother sometimes for certain
things because they wanted them to get

2513
01:43:55,191 --> 01:43:58,660
clean first,
but it's like shit hot,

2514
01:43:58,790 --> 01:44:00,200
you know,
he,

2515
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:01,610
he's,
he's already an addict.

2516
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:05,120
How the fuck did we get them clean so
they don't want to treat the bipolar.

2517
01:44:05,121 --> 01:44:07,640
It was,
you're right that there's similar

2518
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:09,470
things.
Mark says something really important in

2519
01:44:09,471 --> 01:44:10,281
the documentary.
He said,

2520
01:44:10,281 --> 01:44:13,670
I talked to our older brother and the
one thing that he said to me is the only

2521
01:44:13,671 --> 01:44:17,150
time I felt normal was when I was in
jail because I was completely sober.

2522
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:18,900
He had gotten thrown in jail for like,
yeah.

2523
01:44:18,910 --> 01:44:19,743
And I was like,
shit,

2524
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:21,920
you're not bipolar,
you're not bipolar.

2525
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:23,910
Maybe it's a,
maybe it's all the stuff via a lot.

2526
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,580
Who knows?
Biggest part of it,

2527
01:44:25,581 --> 01:44:26,331
you know?
Wow.

2528
01:44:26,331 --> 01:44:28,640
So how long was he in jail for?
Three months.

2529
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:32,090
Then that time he felt okay,
whoa.

2530
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:32,810
Yeah,
I know.

2531
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:36,020
That's was the craziest thing to me too.
That's nuts.

2532
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:39,800
And then when he got out and just
started going back to his old ways and

2533
01:44:39,801 --> 01:44:41,570
he would go,
he would just go up and down,

2534
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:43,000
you know.
And what did he get thrown in jail for?

2535
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:46,100
Violating probation.
I mean like he was a bouncer at a bunch

2536
01:44:46,101 --> 01:44:50,120
of bars and he,
he got into so many fights and he town

2537
01:44:50,130 --> 01:44:54,910
bad ass beat up a lot of people.
If there was mma around back then he

2538
01:44:54,911 --> 01:44:56,270
might have,
he might have had a career,

2539
01:44:57,090 --> 01:45:00,920
but like he was kinda that,
that guy like he never was a bully.

2540
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:03,320
He never boss anybody around,
but if he,

2541
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:05,390
if he saw you and somebody was like,
choking you,

2542
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:07,940
he'd go up and kick the guy's ass.
That's done.

2543
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:10,160
It was never enough for him either to
just hit somebody.

2544
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,980
He had to fucking throw a bar stool on
top of him or something afterward.

2545
01:45:12,981 --> 01:45:17,360
He was one of those guys.
So the bipolar diagnosis and the fact

2546
01:45:17,361 --> 01:45:20,630
that after he was in jail for three
months,

2547
01:45:20,631 --> 01:45:23,380
he felt totally normal.
Do you think that the,

2548
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:26,810
that all the highs and lows are just
coming from the drugs in his system and

2549
01:45:26,811 --> 01:45:31,160
out of a system and the fluctuating
levels and just didn't know how to feel?

2550
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:32,480
I think that's a big part of it.
I mean,

2551
01:45:32,481 --> 01:45:36,350
I can't really speak for him,
but I know for myself when I was trying

2552
01:45:36,351 --> 01:45:38,810
to get off of the drugs,
I went on a horrible drug called

2553
01:45:38,811 --> 01:45:41,870
suboxone,
which is a miracle drug for the time you

2554
01:45:41,871 --> 01:45:43,610
need it.
But the problem is I was on it for eight

2555
01:45:43,611 --> 01:45:48,110
months instead of for one week.
And that's a heroin drug,

2556
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:49,670
right?
It's a,

2557
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,430
it's an opiate that helps you get off of
other opiates.

2558
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:54,220
So it's kind of a weird thing.
But if they.

2559
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:56,540
Did that make you feel high when you're
on that stuff?

2560
01:45:56,570 --> 01:45:57,920
No,
they don't really feel high.

2561
01:45:57,921 --> 01:46:00,020
You just don't feel sick.
And so,

2562
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:01,370
uh,
what happened to me,

2563
01:46:01,371 --> 01:46:03,050
I was,
I was on it for like a really long

2564
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:07,340
extended period of time and I,
I felt completely out of whack all the

2565
01:46:07,341 --> 01:46:08,174
time.
I felt like,

2566
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:11,840
like very up and down because if I
didn't have the drug in me,

2567
01:46:11,841 --> 01:46:13,810
I would have like anxiety,
oh my god,

2568
01:46:13,811 --> 01:46:15,030
I'm gonna get withdrawals.
You know,

2569
01:46:15,290 --> 01:46:16,760
if I didn't,
if I was running out of it,

2570
01:46:16,761 --> 01:46:19,890
I get anxiety.
I just had so many ups and downs from,

2571
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:22,300
from that particular drug.
And I think also from,

2572
01:46:22,690 --> 01:46:25,100
from the opiate painkillers,
they always made me somebody that I

2573
01:46:25,101 --> 01:46:29,740
wasn't always like made me call my
girlfriend at the time and yell at her.

2574
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:31,910
So do some asshole thing that wasn't
really,

2575
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:34,190
you know,
they made you do that.

2576
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,910
I felt compelled to do that in a way
that you would never feel compelled to

2577
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,190
share if you were.
And you're always.

2578
01:46:40,191 --> 01:46:41,570
You always break it down to the truth.
Yeah,

2579
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:44,180
they didn't.
They didn't force me to do it.

2580
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:47,840
But while I was on those,
I exhibited behavior that I wouldn't

2581
01:46:47,841 --> 01:46:49,800
normally do.
The fucking girl in the movie lights

2582
01:46:49,801 --> 01:46:50,070
herself

2583
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,920
on fire.
She's on that story.

2584
01:46:52,921 --> 01:46:55,080
It's so fucking sad that that story
killed me.

2585
01:46:55,081 --> 01:46:56,260
But yeah,
they,

2586
01:46:56,261 --> 01:46:58,480
they make you do some crazy shit like an
ice.

2587
01:46:58,590 --> 01:46:59,850
When I say make,
I think they,

2588
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:03,600
they literally kind of make you do some
crazy stuff because I don't think you're

2589
01:47:03,601 --> 01:47:07,620
really not much control anymore.
Well your brain is a bunch of synopsis

2590
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:11,760
and a bunch of neurochemicals reacting
and a bunch of shit going on.

2591
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:16,080
And when you add some new shit in there
and you're throwing some massive opiates

2592
01:47:16,081 --> 01:47:21,081
in there and all of a sudden all the
signals are all fucking crossed and

2593
01:47:22,110 --> 01:47:25,260
everything's firing goofy.
It's literally not you.

2594
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,470
And iT goes,
it goes to that same fact of like a,

2595
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:29,510
I think therapy is really important for
people.

2596
01:47:29,511 --> 01:47:31,900
And I think therapy is something that
you get to do.

2597
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:33,230
It's not something you have to do,
you know,

2598
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:34,750
like you kind of get to do it.
It's like a,

2599
01:47:35,170 --> 01:47:35,770
some sort of,
you know,

2600
01:47:35,770 --> 01:47:37,960
it's like a luxury I think.
And the thing is that,

2601
01:47:37,961 --> 01:47:39,520
um,
people,

2602
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:42,880
a lot of people will go to therapy and
then they want to get a drug with it,

2603
01:47:42,881 --> 01:47:43,720
you know,
like they want to go.

2604
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:46,510
Like I said,
we have this drug seeking behavior where

2605
01:47:46,511 --> 01:47:47,231
we're like,
well,

2606
01:47:47,231 --> 01:47:49,990
a pill will fix me,
but talking to this guy's not gonna fix

2607
01:47:49,991 --> 01:47:53,150
me when actually talking to the guys,
what can fix you with?

2608
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:56,050
What can be the cure?
It's like we have these things called

2609
01:47:56,051 --> 01:47:57,790
escape fires.
I don't know if you know what that is,

2610
01:47:57,791 --> 01:48:00,020
but like in firefighting,
you know,

2611
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:04,450
there was this giant fire and it's,
and there was 30 15 firefighters on a

2612
01:48:04,451 --> 01:48:06,700
hill and a guy,
one of the guys said,

2613
01:48:06,701 --> 01:48:08,620
hey,
I'm going to light a fire to make the

2614
01:48:08,621 --> 01:48:11,890
fire jumped over this thing that people
like and I will be safe.

2615
01:48:11,890 --> 01:48:13,060
And everybody was like,
no,

2616
01:48:13,061 --> 01:48:15,580
That's not going to work.
And the guy lit a match and did it and

2617
01:48:15,581 --> 01:48:17,920
he was the only one that survived.
Everybody else was trying to get off the

2618
01:48:17,921 --> 01:48:20,650
mountain and they all died.
And like that's the problem with America

2619
01:48:20,651 --> 01:48:22,390
is how's that work?
I'm just saying,

2620
01:48:22,450 --> 01:48:26,830
well it's uk,
it's called the escape fire and so you

2621
01:48:26,831 --> 01:48:30,100
can light a fire to bake the fire,
sort of go around you.

2622
01:48:30,101 --> 01:48:33,140
I don't know exactly how that works,
but what I'm saying is like the answer a

2623
01:48:33,141 --> 01:48:35,360
lot.
The answer a lot of times can be right

2624
01:48:35,361 --> 01:48:36,940
in front of our face.
I can say,

2625
01:48:36,941 --> 01:48:39,190
you know what?
This person needs any therapy and the

2626
01:48:39,191 --> 01:48:43,300
person won't do it.
So that's a big problem with America and

2627
01:48:43,301 --> 01:48:43,901
our,
you know,

2628
01:48:43,901 --> 01:48:45,280
we want,
we want an answer,

2629
01:48:45,281 --> 01:48:47,380
we want a solution,
we want a pill,

2630
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:50,410
we want a quick fix,
we want a pill to get you off pills.

2631
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:51,820
But if I'm standing there I say,
you know what,

2632
01:48:51,821 --> 01:48:52,780
guys,
come with me,

2633
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:54,160
I have the answer.
And he's like,

2634
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:55,023
no,
you don't.

2635
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:56,680
We already know that.
That's not a good answer,

2636
01:48:56,950 --> 01:48:58,960
you know.
So I think that's a problem.

2637
01:48:58,961 --> 01:49:03,070
It's like we have to open our eyes and
open our minds and start thinking of

2638
01:49:03,190 --> 01:49:05,600
different ways to heal.
Pain to cure pain.

2639
01:49:05,601 --> 01:49:06,431
Uh,
you know,

2640
01:49:06,431 --> 01:49:07,300
I mean,
you're never going to cure it.

2641
01:49:07,301 --> 01:49:09,740
You're gonna,
you're gonna hold it down for awhile.

2642
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:12,850
You know,
I think the only way to fix something

2643
01:49:12,851 --> 01:49:15,910
really like surgery or like you said,
stem cells now and everything.

2644
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:20,920
So progressive that I like,
I have a shoulder that I have a rotator

2645
01:49:21,131 --> 01:49:24,550
cuff surgery that I need to have and
I've just held off on getting the

2646
01:49:24,551 --> 01:49:26,140
surgery because I feel like it,
yOu know,

2647
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,780
cutting my shoulder open and doing
whatever is going to do more damage.

2648
01:49:28,781 --> 01:49:30,100
And actually,
you know,

2649
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:31,900
fix it,
which is maybe a stupid thinG to think,

2650
01:49:31,901 --> 01:49:34,030
but I'm actually trying to figure out
like,

2651
01:49:34,031 --> 01:49:35,620
hey,
stem cells or stem cells.

2652
01:49:35,621 --> 01:49:37,060
Good.
Is there another answer to this?

2653
01:49:37,061 --> 01:49:38,590
You know,
haven't found It yet,

2654
01:49:38,591 --> 01:49:39,790
but you know,
maybe I will.

2655
01:49:39,791 --> 01:49:42,250
And if I,
if I don't then I'll go get the surgery.

2656
01:49:42,251 --> 01:49:43,780
But I'm trying to explore other options.

2657
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:45,800
Yeah.
It's not a bad idea to explore other

2658
01:49:45,801 --> 01:49:48,040
options,
but it really depends entirely upon

2659
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,330
how badly your shoulders damaged,
how badly the structure of damaged in

2660
01:49:52,331 --> 01:49:54,700
the shoulder is a weird one because it
moves so weird.

2661
01:49:54,701 --> 01:49:56,800
It's got so many different ways it can
articulate.

2662
01:49:57,230 --> 01:50:00,610
It's a tear in the rotator cuff.
Super common.

2663
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:01,673
Yeah.
Yeah.

2664
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:04,060
You know,
one of the things that we talked about

2665
01:50:04,061 --> 01:50:05,360
before about these,
uh,

2666
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:07,180
advertising,
uh,

2667
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:09,370
the,
the ability to advertise for drugs.

2668
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:11,740
I don't know if they're ever going to
take that down,

2669
01:50:11,741 --> 01:50:15,490
but I think that that is one of the more
disturbing aspects of the pharmaceutical

2670
01:50:15,491 --> 01:50:19,540
industry because we all know tHat
advertising gets people to buy shit and

2671
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:23,230
it's not that big of a problem and it's
a car or when it's an iphone,

2672
01:50:23,231 --> 01:50:25,030
I don't haVe a problem with it.
You know what I mean?

2673
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:25,871
People can say,
well,

2674
01:50:25,871 --> 01:50:26,950
it can.
You know,

2675
01:50:26,951 --> 01:50:29,860
it supports consumerism and materialism
and that's not bad.

2676
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,440
That's not good for our culture.
You can just.

2677
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,910
You could be strong enough to get past
that and I think you're going to be all

2678
01:50:34,911 --> 01:50:37,150
right,
but the pill thing,

2679
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:37,901
well,
it's different.

2680
01:50:37,901 --> 01:50:41,110
We trust doctors like you don't go to a
car dealership,

2681
01:50:41,111 --> 01:50:45,460
trust in the car dealer to be like a
bargain,

2682
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:46,500
right?
Take care of.

2683
01:50:46,690 --> 01:50:48,160
Take care of your life.
Let's also,

2684
01:50:48,161 --> 01:50:52,810
they suggest that you ask your doctor,
shouldn't your fucking doctor tell you

2685
01:50:52,811 --> 01:50:55,960
what medications do you know that people
that ask their doctor,

2686
01:50:55,961 --> 01:50:57,340
when I go into stat,
say,

2687
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:59,260
when you go in and ask your doctor for a
pill,

2688
01:50:59,261 --> 01:51:01,300
75 percent of the people will get that
pill.

2689
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:04,090
So that's,
that's crazy because here's what happens

2690
01:51:04,091 --> 01:51:07,030
wIth doctors.
The doctors are overprescribing for

2691
01:51:07,031 --> 01:51:09,400
sure,
but their hands are tied because if I go

2692
01:51:09,401 --> 01:51:11,320
into a doctor and I tell them I'm in
pain,

2693
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:14,950
their job,
according to the medical industry,

2694
01:51:14,951 --> 01:51:16,360
their job is getting out of pain.

2695
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:17,980
So how did they get out of pain?
They gave me an opiate,

2696
01:51:17,981 --> 01:51:19,630
painkillers.
They give me All these different things

2697
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:22,450
to get me out of pain.
Now if they don't get me out of pain and

2698
01:51:22,451 --> 01:51:24,080
I fill out a doctor survey,
so you know what?

2699
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:27,130
My doctor didn't get me out of pain.
That doctor gets a bad rating.

2700
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:29,050
They get enough bad ratings,
they can lose their license.

2701
01:51:29,230 --> 01:51:32,620
So there's a lot of pressure on doctors
also.

2702
01:51:32,621 --> 01:51:34,750
How the hell is anybody know how much
pain you're in?

2703
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:35,980
Yeah,
that's a big one,

2704
01:51:35,981 --> 01:51:38,890
right?
Neck pain or back pain really hurts,

2705
01:51:38,891 --> 01:51:41,080
like on a scale of one to 10,
say yeah,

2706
01:51:41,470 --> 01:51:44,380
anybody can say that they've got
something wrong with her back.

2707
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:48,100
And I talk about painkiller.
Painkiller is actually a great thing for

2708
01:51:48,101 --> 01:51:49,960
acute pain.
So you get in a car accident,

2709
01:51:49,961 --> 01:51:52,270
you have a broken leg,
whatever it takes some oxycontin,

2710
01:51:52,271 --> 01:51:54,310
you don't feel it and it take that for
what,

2711
01:51:54,311 --> 01:51:55,240
two or three days,
you know,

2712
01:51:55,241 --> 01:51:58,630
you don't take that for four months
because then you become a drug addict.

2713
01:51:58,930 --> 01:52:02,460
So I think that if a also like the
prescribing and uh,

2714
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:03,870
the,
the number of,

2715
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,280
of actual pills we give people needs to
come down.

2716
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:08,630
We just make to way too many drugs.
Is it,

2717
01:52:08,790 --> 01:52:10,830
is it all just money driven you think?
Because uh,

2718
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:12,580
you know,
like if you get a ticket,

2719
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:15,340
you know,
you get a speeding ticket that's like on

2720
01:52:15,341 --> 01:52:18,280
your record and you get noticed,
speeding ticket shows up,

2721
01:52:18,281 --> 01:52:20,320
right?
How come they don't have something

2722
01:52:20,321 --> 01:52:21,670
similar with,
with drugs?

2723
01:52:21,671 --> 01:52:22,150
You know,
when you,

2724
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:24,640
when you get prescribed a drug,
like how come you don't have like a

2725
01:52:24,641 --> 01:52:25,510
record?
Well,

2726
01:52:25,511 --> 01:52:27,250
there is at least,
at least within the state,

2727
01:52:27,251 --> 01:52:29,890
in California there is a.
There is a thing,

2728
01:52:29,891 --> 01:52:31,960
but the problem is not everybody's
required to use it.

2729
01:52:31,961 --> 01:52:35,140
It's not mandatory.
So When when that kind of stuff becomes

2730
01:52:35,141 --> 01:52:37,240
mandatory,
it should be fun because a lot of people

2731
01:52:37,241 --> 01:52:37,571
say,
well,

2732
01:52:37,571 --> 01:52:39,230
it's my privacy.
Like if I go,

2733
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:42,250
if I go to costco,
costco shouldn't be able to know what I

2734
01:52:42,251 --> 01:52:44,680
get at walgreens and I'm like,
you know what?

2735
01:52:44,681 --> 01:52:46,010
At some point we have to lose

2736
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,850
that privacy issue because it's killing
people or to protect people.

2737
01:52:49,851 --> 01:52:50,520
Yeah.
We're.

2738
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:53,630
We're to protect people.
I think sometimes in society we need

2739
01:52:53,631 --> 01:52:56,090
laws that protect people from
themselves.

2740
01:52:57,510 --> 01:53:01,520
That's what caused the whole oxycontin
industry in Florida was that they didn't

2741
01:53:01,521 --> 01:53:03,980
have a database where you could go to a
doctor,

2742
01:53:03,981 --> 01:53:05,530
get a prescription,
then go down the road,

2743
01:53:05,550 --> 01:53:07,310
get another prescription from another
doctor.

2744
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:11,570
When the vanguard released that,
that piece of the oxycontin express,

2745
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:15,190
which a really kind of highlighted that
and it showed a bunch of people and that

2746
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:17,960
people that eventually wound up dying of
overdoses,

2747
01:53:17,961 --> 01:53:20,750
but when they followed them around and
found out how easy it is to go to these

2748
01:53:20,751 --> 01:53:23,930
pain management centers,
that's what changed the industry and

2749
01:53:23,931 --> 01:53:27,770
that's what also changed the pills,
the be able to crush them up and smoke

2750
01:53:27,771 --> 01:53:29,330
them.
We can't do that anymore.

2751
01:53:29,410 --> 01:53:30,650
Do they call those pill mills?

2752
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:34,310
Pill mills and people just go.
And those people at West Virginia,

2753
01:53:34,311 --> 01:53:37,370
there's a movie called oxycontin.
I've pretty much seen every drug movie

2754
01:53:37,371 --> 01:53:39,620
now.
So oxycontin was a pretty interesting

2755
01:53:39,621 --> 01:53:43,030
movie where it was just about one single
town in West Virginia and that's like

2756
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:47,420
the nickname of the town and these
people drive from west Virginia down to

2757
01:53:47,421 --> 01:53:48,980
Florida,
get like a thousand pills,

2758
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:51,470
come back and sell them on.
It's like that's what they do.

2759
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:54,380
And for West Virginia they got a lot of
money doing it and stuff like that,

2760
01:53:54,381 --> 01:53:56,060
you know,
because everything's cheaper there.

2761
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:58,400
But uh,
they've caused an epidemic there.

2762
01:53:58,401 --> 01:53:59,510
There's,
there's a,

2763
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:01,730
you know,
a couple of hundred people that live in

2764
01:54:01,731 --> 01:54:04,850
that town there and there's a couple
people that are trafficking all these

2765
01:54:04,851 --> 01:54:07,100
drugs in and making this huge problem.
Yeah.

2766
01:54:07,101 --> 01:54:10,040
Those depression commercials are
particularly problematic,

2767
01:54:10,041 --> 01:54:11,540
man,
where everybody's smiling.

2768
01:54:11,541 --> 01:54:15,260
There's butterflies and flowers and you
see the sun coming up on the person's

2769
01:54:15,261 --> 01:54:18,530
face and all of a sudden they're smiling
again and you want that.

2770
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:21,680
Like it's.
It's really dangerous because it's so

2771
01:54:21,681 --> 01:54:24,140
influential.
You watch a commercial and those

2772
01:54:24,141 --> 01:54:26,060
commercials,
like it's visual,

2773
01:54:26,061 --> 01:54:28,310
there's music playing.
There's a pretty girl.

2774
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:31,030
The sunset in so influential.
Yeah,

2775
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,610
those little sad,
like a,

2776
01:54:32,930 --> 01:54:36,350
not like stick figures,
but a little fat chubby faces like round

2777
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:37,350
moon.
Yay.

2778
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:38,050
Little,
right.

2779
01:54:38,050 --> 01:54:42,890
The zoloft point of the advertisement Is
really is to sell it.

2780
01:54:43,070 --> 01:54:44,450
They have to list the side effects,
right.

2781
01:54:44,451 --> 01:54:47,030
That's part of it,
blah that real quick.

2782
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:49,160
But the thing is the whole rest of the
commercials,

2783
01:54:49,161 --> 01:54:50,810
just to distract you from the side
effects.

2784
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:53,210
One of this,
one of the commercials is showing a

2785
01:54:53,211 --> 01:54:54,320
woman,
which I,

2786
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:55,610
you know,
that's fine.

2787
01:54:55,611 --> 01:54:57,290
I can take any,
but it just seems random.

2788
01:54:57,470 --> 01:55:01,310
They show this woman getting like this,
like a backhoe and she's operating as

2789
01:55:01,311 --> 01:55:03,320
bacco and ashley ashley's operated back
on,

2790
01:55:03,321 --> 01:55:06,440
they say don't operate heavy machinery
while using this product and you're

2791
01:55:06,441 --> 01:55:08,030
like,
this is so backwards.

2792
01:55:08,031 --> 01:55:11,060
She's operating a,
some sort of like a crane or a backhoe

2793
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:15,470
and she's like in like a business outfit
and they don't have the machinery and

2794
01:55:15,471 --> 01:55:17,270
you're like,
where are these people getting,

2795
01:55:17,450 --> 01:55:19,280
you know,
who are the ad wizards behind this one?

2796
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:24,470
And then the.
Then the other thing was the saying that

2797
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:28,010
medication for depression didn't do any
better,

2798
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:31,850
didn't get people any less depressed
than any other method of treating it.

2799
01:55:32,270 --> 01:55:33,170
Yeah.
And like you said,

2800
01:55:33,171 --> 01:55:37,010
you had a friend that he did some
antidepressants and it helped them and I

2801
01:55:37,330 --> 01:55:39,080
Was,
if he just got off fucking propecia,

2802
01:55:39,081 --> 01:55:42,230
it might have cut it off right there.
And also though I don't know enough

2803
01:55:42,231 --> 01:55:44,880
about it to say like shouldn't take this
or shouldn't take that.

2804
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:47,250
What I'd say is like look into it more.
You know,

2805
01:55:47,251 --> 01:55:49,040
you haVe to become your own doctor,
you know.

2806
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:50,790
And if I say like,
look,

2807
01:55:50,791 --> 01:55:53,340
I know how effective antidepressants
are,

2808
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:56,970
how effective they are not,
but if I say it people to slam me for

2809
01:55:56,971 --> 01:55:57,271
it,
they're like,

2810
01:55:57,271 --> 01:55:57,781
oh,
this guy,

2811
01:55:57,781 --> 01:55:59,010
you know,
he's not a doctor or whatever.

2812
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:01,530
So what I'm saying to you is go out and
do your research on it,

2813
01:56:01,531 --> 01:56:04,500
you know,
and find out how effective or

2814
01:56:04,501 --> 01:56:05,760
noneffective your drug is.

2815
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:09,300
It just seemed crazy that they're
allowed to advertise and that seems like

2816
01:56:09,301 --> 01:56:12,270
something we have to stop.
But the amount of money that they have,

2817
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:14,190
the amount.
I mean the Woman,

2818
01:56:16,150 --> 01:56:19,470
the woman in the documentary whose niece
burned herself to death,

2819
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:21,590
she said it best,
the,

2820
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,100
the,
they're drug pushers,

2821
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:26,090
they're illegal drug.
It was hurt right there.

2822
01:56:26,130 --> 01:56:29,100
Illegal drug pushers.
And the fact that we allow them to

2823
01:56:29,101 --> 01:56:31,560
advertise on television like that.
That's gotta stop.

2824
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,670
It's gotta stop.
It's one of the most difficult temescal

2825
01:56:34,690 --> 01:56:37,100
yeah.
And we took tobacco off tv and you know,

2826
01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:38,910
we still have,
we still have a huge,

2827
01:56:38,911 --> 01:56:40,740
uh,
there's still a large amount of people

2828
01:56:40,741 --> 01:56:42,150
that die from smoking cigarettes or
whatever,

2829
01:56:42,151 --> 01:56:44,040
but like,
it's sort of their freedom now.

2830
01:56:44,041 --> 01:56:46,170
It's like their choice,
like they know it's bad,

2831
01:56:46,171 --> 01:56:49,260
it has a warning on it says this could
kill you if used as directed.

2832
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:51,110
This could kill you.
And uh,

2833
01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:52,790
these pills aren't saying that.
No,

2834
01:56:52,830 --> 01:56:55,590
they're not saying that,
but documentaries like yours are,

2835
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,690
and I think we need more stuff like
that.

2836
01:56:57,691 --> 01:57:01,170
Me need more things like what you did,
where people get ahold of it and they

2837
01:57:01,171 --> 01:57:03,960
watch it and they,
they listened to the message and they

2838
01:57:03,961 --> 01:57:04,794
go,
you know what?

2839
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:07,080
There's this.
Is this something that,

2840
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,790
this is something that needs to be
talked about.

2841
01:57:09,150 --> 01:57:10,890
This is something that you're not
hearing.

2842
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,080
You're not hearing our leaders talk
about.

2843
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:15,660
You're not hearing our politicians talk
about who are running for office,

2844
01:57:15,661 --> 01:57:18,420
are not talking about this massive
epidemic that's killing more people than

2845
01:57:18,421 --> 01:57:21,300
car accidents.
That was another interesting statistic

2846
01:57:21,301 --> 01:57:25,950
from your movie that pill overdose and
kill more people every year than car

2847
01:57:25,951 --> 01:57:28,290
accidents.
I'm lucky I came out the other side and

2848
01:57:28,291 --> 01:57:30,150
my brother didn't know our brother,
mad dog.

2849
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:31,670
He didn't make it.
Make it out the other side.

2850
01:57:31,671 --> 01:57:35,090
And now my friends have lost two friends
to oxicon.

2851
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:36,780
We lost an uncle as well.
Yeah,

2852
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:42,170
and my goal is just to help people not
be in the predicament I was in.

2853
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:44,390
It's terrible.
You know,

2854
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:46,650
it's terrible.
I have people email me on facebook and I

2855
01:57:46,651 --> 01:57:50,310
encourage people tweet me or email me,
ask me questions.

2856
01:57:50,311 --> 01:57:52,650
I'm not.
I'm not too busy to help somebody in

2857
01:57:52,651 --> 01:57:55,950
need so so many people out here
listening to you that are listening to

2858
01:57:55,951 --> 01:57:59,100
this podcast that are just like us,
that know people that haVe died.

2859
01:57:59,130 --> 01:58:00,890
There's so many.
It's such a fucking,

2860
01:58:00,891 --> 01:58:02,820
like you said,
a one guy acting really weird.

2861
01:58:02,821 --> 01:58:04,410
If he have a friend That's acting
strange,

2862
01:58:04,411 --> 01:58:08,220
it's not showing up on time to certain
things that's avoiding you when you call

2863
01:58:08,221 --> 01:58:10,080
them and just not communicating with you
anymore.

2864
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:12,540
You're going to have to try to figure
out a way to reach out to that person

2865
01:58:12,541 --> 01:58:15,280
because something's probably up.
You know,

2866
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:18,090
rehab is very expensive and I want to
tell people,

2867
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:20,400
don't use that as an excuse.
Don't use like,

2868
01:58:20,401 --> 01:58:22,200
it's too expensive.
I can't afford it.

2869
01:58:22,201 --> 01:58:24,390
Excuse,
hit me up and we'll figure out how to

2870
01:58:24,391 --> 01:58:26,160
get it done.
There's a free.

2871
01:58:26,161 --> 01:58:28,860
There's a lot of,
there's waYs to do these programs too,

2872
01:58:28,861 --> 01:58:29,491
I'd imagine.
Yeah.

2873
01:58:29,491 --> 01:58:31,830
There's ways to approach this.
There's government programs,

2874
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:35,100
there's a certain insurance you can get,
like there's a lot of things that a lot

2875
01:58:35,101 --> 01:58:36,900
of people don't know and they should
know.

2876
01:58:36,901 --> 01:58:38,900
So if somebody out there struggling
like,

2877
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:40,920
you know,
feel free to hit me up and I'll help as

2878
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:44,740
people as I can.
What else do you think that people need

2879
01:58:44,741 --> 01:58:49,741
to know about the prescription drug
industry that you think is like a not,

2880
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:53,250
not being talked about on a daily basis?

2881
01:58:54,390 --> 01:58:56,830
They're just being lied to.
A lot of people are being lied to.

2882
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:00,760
These studies that they do.
They only have to do two studies.

2883
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:05,300
They only have to show the fda to
studies that are effective and biased.

2884
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:07,750
When I say effective,
they just mean they have to be slightly

2885
01:59:07,751 --> 01:59:11,680
more effective than a sugar pill,
which means it could be just some crappy

2886
01:59:11,681 --> 01:59:14,270
drug and that could be the placebo
effects.

2887
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:15,790
Somebody said,
I feel better because I'm taking this.

2888
01:59:15,791 --> 01:59:17,590
right,
so that's.

2889
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:21,190
That doesn't seem like as much of a
hurdle as a drug companies make it out

2890
01:59:21,191 --> 01:59:22,090
to be.
Yes,

2891
01:59:22,091 --> 01:59:24,460
it costs a lot of money to get a drug to
market,

2892
01:59:24,461 --> 01:59:26,800
like they say,
almost like a billion dollar sometimes

2893
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:31,300
just to get a drug to the market,
but they're going to make so much more

2894
01:59:31,301 --> 01:59:34,630
money off that and profit off of that.
And then part of that money that the in

2895
01:59:34,631 --> 01:59:35,800
the research and development.

2896
01:59:36,070 --> 01:59:38,770
Well just put it this way,
last year,

2897
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,990
I think it was last year,
and John Oliver oliver said this,

2898
01:59:40,991 --> 01:59:44,970
John Oliver did a great piece on this on
his show and he says,

2899
01:59:44,971 --> 01:59:46,960
uh,
I think last year that nine out of the

2900
01:59:46,961 --> 01:59:51,370
top 10 drug companies spent more money
on advertising than they did on research

2901
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:55,090
and development.
That's a big fuck you to all of us a big

2902
01:59:55,091 --> 01:59:59,650
fuck you right in all of our faces are
they save a lot of money for lawsuits

2903
01:59:59,651 --> 02:00:01,600
too.
That's likE the price is the price of

2904
02:00:01,601 --> 02:00:03,850
businesses is them to save a lot of
money,

2905
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:06,730
put a lot of money away for.
But then they do the calculations.

2906
02:00:06,731 --> 02:00:08,470
They run the numbers and I'm like,
okay,

2907
02:00:08,471 --> 02:00:11,680
well if this many people try to sue us
for death or whatever the fuck it is,

2908
02:00:11,681 --> 02:00:15,550
their problem we're still going to make
out with with $4,000,000,000 or whatever

2909
02:00:15,551 --> 02:00:16,384
it is.

2910
02:00:16,570 --> 02:00:18,800
There's all kinds of crazy shit factored
into the,

2911
02:00:19,030 --> 02:00:20,140
to the profit margin.
You know,

2912
02:00:20,141 --> 02:00:24,220
if I sell a standard business practice,
like gm does that and stuff.

2913
02:00:24,221 --> 02:00:25,310
Like a lot of companies,
you know,

2914
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:28,960
it's just the way people do stuff.
If I make eight billioN dollars and I

2915
02:00:28,961 --> 02:00:31,480
lost two bIllion in a lawsuit,
who cares?

2916
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:34,510
It's $6,000,000,000 on top,
right?

2917
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:36,340
Yeah.
The studies,

2918
02:00:36,341 --> 02:00:38,230
the way you showed how they do their
studies too.

2919
02:00:38,231 --> 02:00:42,160
That was really an eye opening thing.
Hundreds of studies and they don't have

2920
02:00:42,161 --> 02:00:44,600
to show you the results there.
Listen,

2921
02:00:44,710 --> 02:00:46,330
if there's nothing wrong with this,
if,

2922
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:50,800
if I'm not being lied to,
then why the fuck did the fda not do an

2923
02:00:50,801 --> 02:00:53,300
interview with me?
Why did the dea you do it?

2924
02:00:53,390 --> 02:00:54,380
No,
they were.

2925
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:54,791
They're like,
well,

2926
02:00:54,791 --> 02:00:57,100
you can just look on our website.
All her shIt's on our website.

2927
02:00:57,370 --> 02:00:58,240
Are you fucking kidding me?

2928
02:00:58,240 --> 02:01:00,250
I want to do an interview with you,
I want to talk to you,

2929
02:01:00,251 --> 02:01:03,490
I want to ask your questions.
I want to ask the dea was responsible

2930
02:01:03,491 --> 02:01:06,220
for how many drugs are made each year,
what the hell,

2931
02:01:06,430 --> 02:01:08,220
what's going on here?
And they won't.

2932
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:11,380
These people are public servants.
They work for us and they won't do

2933
02:01:11,381 --> 02:01:13,000
interviews.
And that's bullshit.

2934
02:01:13,001 --> 02:01:14,830
You know,
like that's something that makes me

2935
02:01:14,831 --> 02:01:17,230
angry because like,
I had all these ideas for the movie.

2936
02:01:17,410 --> 02:01:19,690
I'm going to ask this guy,
I'm going to ask this guy and they just

2937
02:01:19,691 --> 02:01:21,340
don't want to talk to you.
Whoa,

2938
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:23,560
that's,
that's disturbing.

2939
02:01:23,561 --> 02:01:26,190
Because you would feel like someone
who's a public servant like that,

2940
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:29,650
that they have an obligation to,
they should have some sort of a pr

2941
02:01:29,651 --> 02:01:32,290
representative that has an obligation to
state their policy.

2942
02:01:32,310 --> 02:01:34,320
And the pr representative told me,
uh,

2943
02:01:34,630 --> 02:01:35,700
like basically like,
um,

2944
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:38,050
you know,
I'm not nbc and cbs.

2945
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:39,600
I'm not hbo.
I'm,

2946
02:01:39,610 --> 02:01:40,280
I'm always

2947
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:43,670
do all my movies independently and then
he'll bring them to somebody afterwards.

2948
02:01:43,671 --> 02:01:47,150
And so that's kind of a tough thing too,
is like not calling up and have the

2949
02:01:47,151 --> 02:01:50,360
credentials.
You have to establish documentaries that

2950
02:01:50,361 --> 02:01:52,070
have done very well.
I think that,

2951
02:01:52,071 --> 02:01:54,800
uh,
I also think that people might have seen

2952
02:01:54,801 --> 02:01:57,470
those documentary and say,
we're not coming in our doors,

2953
02:01:57,471 --> 02:01:59,570
you know,
fucking troublemaker.

2954
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:03,710
Throw us under the bus,
man.

2955
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:05,750
Just bizarre,
bizarre,

2956
02:02:05,751 --> 02:02:08,470
bizarre world we live in where this is
the norm there,

2957
02:02:08,550 --> 02:02:10,580
these,
these pills that people are taking these

2958
02:02:10,581 --> 02:02:13,580
consciousness altering pills that
they're trying to force down people's

2959
02:02:13,581 --> 02:02:15,140
throats.
That was the other thing that I wanted

2960
02:02:15,141 --> 02:02:20,120
to talk about,
the connection between statens and like

2961
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:23,540
how little statents work and the fact
that statens,

2962
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:27,830
the people that sell them also sell
viagra will make you impotent.

2963
02:02:28,730 --> 02:02:33,080
They sell viagra to give you a bone or
afterward there's a new commercial too

2964
02:02:33,081 --> 02:02:35,000
with the constipation.

2965
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:37,700
If you're taking opiate pills and
they're in and you're getting

2966
02:02:37,701 --> 02:02:39,770
constipated and you constantly have
another pill for you,

2967
02:02:39,830 --> 02:02:42,760
it's probably the same goddamn company.
If you're taking a,

2968
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:44,960
taking a psych bed,
it's not working.

2969
02:02:44,961 --> 02:02:47,370
You gotta throw abilify on top of not.
I'll build a phi.

2970
02:02:47,380 --> 02:02:50,050
Supposed to be like really scary for
people to like.

2971
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:53,900
It's all scary what the abilify's like.
One of those ones that really gives you

2972
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:57,830
a rabid suicide wait a second.
Our doctors really telling me,

2973
02:02:57,890 --> 02:03:00,680
telling us,
you and me that we need to take an

2974
02:03:00,681 --> 02:03:02,840
antidepressant and if it doesn't work,
if it doesn't work,

2975
02:03:02,841 --> 02:03:04,800
take another antidepressant top of it.
But you know what,

2976
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:07,100
don't smoke weed.
That would be bad.

2977
02:03:07,101 --> 02:03:11,110
it's bad for you.
It seems like marijuana would fix.

2978
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:14,810
Could fix those problems with anxiety
and stress and confused,

2979
02:03:14,830 --> 02:03:15,360
you know,
whatever.

2980
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:18,990
Is marijuana fixing anxiety because it
makes me anxious as fuck.

2981
02:03:19,590 --> 02:03:21,500
Makes you paranoid a little bit.
Yeah.

2982
02:03:21,710 --> 02:03:25,070
Well it makes me aware.
I mean I think that paranoia is just be

2983
02:03:25,071 --> 02:03:28,700
you being aware of how vulnerable you
really are and how crazy the world.

2984
02:03:28,701 --> 02:03:31,970
We started thinking of weird shit and
start thinking about it as you know what

2985
02:03:31,971 --> 02:03:33,350
it is,
but staten.

2986
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:36,870
So statens don't really help you.
Well look at that low.

2987
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:38,840
If you lower cholesterol,
what's that gonna do for you?

2988
02:03:39,770 --> 02:03:41,660
Well,
there's good cholesterol and bad

2989
02:03:41,661 --> 02:03:44,180
cholesterol.
We have this idea in our head that we

2990
02:03:44,181 --> 02:03:47,360
have to get rid of cholesterol,
but I think getting like lowering your

2991
02:03:47,361 --> 02:03:50,900
cholesterol they say really doesn't have
much of an effect on like whether or not

2992
02:03:50,901 --> 02:03:53,090
you're going to have a heart attack.
It's not like one of the markers

2993
02:03:53,091 --> 02:03:55,610
anymore.
Like I think that the problem is not as

2994
02:03:55,740 --> 02:03:57,310
big of a factor as they once thought.

2995
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:58,310
The problem is.
Like,

2996
02:03:58,360 --> 02:04:00,110
do you really need to lower your
cholesterol?

2997
02:04:00,111 --> 02:04:03,170
Do you really need to.
Like he'll fix your diet and do it

2998
02:04:03,171 --> 02:04:06,290
through other ways that's responsible
for a lot of brain function is

2999
02:04:06,291 --> 02:04:11,291
responsible for all testosterone cream.
Yeah.

3000
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:12,610
I think,
uh,

3001
02:04:12,610 --> 02:04:15,280
you know,
people's cholesterol and trIglycerides,

3002
02:04:15,281 --> 02:04:17,330
it's of go through the roof just because
poor eating habits,

3003
02:04:17,331 --> 02:04:19,220
not necessarily because they eat
saturated fats,

3004
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:21,590
saturated fats.
That's another thing that people keep

3005
02:04:21,591 --> 02:04:23,030
saying,
saturated fats are bad for you.

3006
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:25,130
The parent old studies,
no,

3007
02:04:25,131 --> 02:04:27,080
they're not bad for you.
Saturated fats are,

3008
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:31,520
it depends entirely on what your eating,
what your body requirements are.

3009
02:04:31,521 --> 02:04:34,910
If you eat too much of anything,
you're going to get fat and that's not

3010
02:04:35,010 --> 02:04:36,980
healthy.
Your saturated fats from pizza,

3011
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:39,480
it's probably not the best option
because we're eating like four or five

3012
02:04:39,481 --> 02:04:42,840
times a day or something that I love
pizza.

3013
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:44,250
Well,
we're all adults,

3014
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:46,830
right?
But we're all learning from other adults

3015
02:04:46,831 --> 02:04:47,491
that,
you know,

3016
02:04:47,491 --> 02:04:50,340
our parents and our parent's parents
that didn't have much fucking

3017
02:04:50,341 --> 02:04:53,250
information.
So we're growing up with these people

3018
02:04:53,251 --> 02:04:55,020
that really didn't know what they were
talking about.

3019
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:58,500
They really didn't have any idea where
we're eating sugary cereal for breakfast

3020
02:04:58,501 --> 02:05:03,501
and we just didn't know studies that our
parents had in the 19 sixties in the 19

3021
02:05:04,201 --> 02:05:05,820
seventies.
What they had to go on,

3022
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,280
the information that they were they were
given.

3023
02:05:08,370 --> 02:05:11,880
It's just so poor in comparison to what
we know now have was up.

3024
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:18,000
They want to do.
I was saying I have a projecT I want to

3025
02:05:18,001 --> 02:05:19,250
do that basically,
you know,

3026
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:22,080
one day you'll read in the newspaper
that you should drink coffee.

3027
02:05:22,081 --> 02:05:24,580
It has all these health benefits and the
next day you'll read it as bad for you.

3028
02:05:24,581 --> 02:05:27,300
Right?
So you hAve all these conflicting things

3029
02:05:27,301 --> 02:05:29,070
all the time.
Go vegan and don't go vegan,

3030
02:05:29,071 --> 02:05:30,540
do keto,
don't know.

3031
02:05:30,590 --> 02:05:33,420
And nobody really knows the truth that I
don't know the truth.

3032
02:05:33,421 --> 02:05:36,810
So like that's what I want to do is go
out and seek a basis basically do

3033
02:05:36,811 --> 02:05:40,890
mythbusters in the world of health and
fitness because there are people out

3034
02:05:40,891 --> 02:05:44,240
there that no,
we just have to go find them and expose

3035
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:45,810
them to the world so other people can
know.

3036
02:05:46,050 --> 02:05:50,550
There are a few people out there that
have a really good understanding of most

3037
02:05:50,551 --> 02:05:51,560
of what they're talking about.

3038
02:05:52,030 --> 02:05:54,180
But the problem is when it comes to the
human body,

3039
02:05:54,181 --> 02:05:57,180
there's so many fucking variables.
And then there's also so many different

3040
02:05:57,181 --> 02:05:59,670
types of people.
There's some people that just,

3041
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:02,610
they need different nutritional,
they have different nutritional

3042
02:06:02,611 --> 02:06:06,090
requirements that maybe you do or I do.
There's just no getting around that.

3043
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:09,060
We always talk about our friend dr.
Lane norton who uh,

3044
02:06:09,150 --> 02:06:12,150
kinda brought flexible dieting to the
forefront of most sure how familiar you

3045
02:06:12,151 --> 02:06:14,340
are with it.
But basically it's almost like

3046
02:06:14,370 --> 02:06:17,430
weightwatchers in a way where it's like
you can have all kinds of things.

3047
02:06:17,431 --> 02:06:19,270
You can eat some pizza,
you can have some ice cream,

3048
02:06:19,271 --> 02:06:20,700
you can eat steak,
you eat chicken,

3049
02:06:20,701 --> 02:06:24,840
you can eat all over the map as long as
you're kind of fitting within a calorie

3050
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:26,860
macros as long as.
Yeah,

3051
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:29,670
as long as it fits your macros,
as long as it fits your caloric intake

3052
02:06:29,671 --> 02:06:31,830
for the day and let's not be stupid
about it.

3053
02:06:31,831 --> 02:06:34,800
You can't be eating junk everyday all
the time.

3054
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:36,900
Well,
people take his stuff out of context,

3055
02:06:36,901 --> 02:06:37,570
right,
and they'll say,

3056
02:06:37,570 --> 02:06:39,900
well,
they post pictures of pop tarts and say

3057
02:06:39,901 --> 02:06:41,490
I'm on flexible dieting,
and it's like,

3058
02:06:41,491 --> 02:06:43,800
well,
you didn't post a 95 percent of the

3059
02:06:43,801 --> 02:06:46,760
stuff that you ate that was healthy
chicken and rice or whatever,

3060
02:06:46,810 --> 02:06:48,090
or like vegan oreos.

3061
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:53,460
I don't even think though that there's a
trend that people kind of understanding

3062
02:06:53,461 --> 02:06:56,250
this a little bit More now.
at least it's starting to gain momentum.

3063
02:06:56,251 --> 02:06:59,430
You've seen people that are
concentrating on organic vegetables.

3064
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:01,860
I mean,
even just like the seminar that I did

3065
02:07:01,861 --> 02:07:03,270
where there was,
I don't know how many people there.

3066
02:07:03,271 --> 02:07:06,510
There's a bunch of people,
a shitload of people there.

3067
02:07:06,511 --> 02:07:07,560
I mean,
years ago,

3068
02:07:07,561 --> 02:07:09,210
if I did a power thing seminar,
I couldn't,

3069
02:07:09,270 --> 02:07:11,560
I couldn't beg people to go to it.
There's,

3070
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:13,380
there's women there now.
There's girls,

3071
02:07:13,381 --> 02:07:14,071
you know.
It's like weird.

3072
02:07:14,071 --> 02:07:16,620
It's like I figured out the way to get
that big juicy ass.

3073
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:19,890
Yeah.
There's not a whole lot of teenagers,

3074
02:07:20,010 --> 02:07:24,380
white women are evolving.
We would go into these power lifting

3075
02:07:24,410 --> 02:07:27,420
meets again that ass.
But yeah,

3076
02:07:27,421 --> 02:07:28,380
it's,
it's changing.

3077
02:07:28,381 --> 02:07:30,150
You know,
people are starting to learn that

3078
02:07:30,151 --> 02:07:32,170
strength is important.
Even as you get older,

3079
02:07:32,171 --> 02:07:34,120
as you get into their forties and
fifties and sixties,

3080
02:07:34,530 --> 02:07:36,040
more important because you need

3081
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,830
to keep your bone density and keep your
muscle mass and it's important for

3082
02:07:38,831 --> 02:07:39,520
women,
you know,

3083
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,230
they have osteoporosis and stuff like
that.

3084
02:07:41,231 --> 02:07:46,120
Eyes When you go on vacation and you go
by the pool and their bodies are just

3085
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:48,760
gone.
Shoulders don't exist.

3086
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:50,770
It's like old women.
I just want to run up to him and put

3087
02:07:50,771 --> 02:07:53,200
them in an americano and just ripped her
shoulder apart because it's just,

3088
02:07:53,230 --> 02:07:54,650
it's not attached to anything.
Yeah.

3089
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:59,880
It just seems like it's like loosely.
You just feel like you're not together.

3090
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:03,820
If you do that,
never do that.

3091
02:08:03,821 --> 02:08:04,361
I don't,
I'm just kidding.

3092
02:08:04,361 --> 02:08:06,520
Come on.
But I mean you look at their bodies,

3093
02:08:06,521 --> 02:08:07,131
you know,
like my god,

3094
02:08:07,131 --> 02:08:10,630
if this guy has to pick up anything,
his body's going to break and this is a

3095
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:13,810
guy who at one point in time was a
teenager who was a young,

3096
02:08:13,990 --> 02:08:16,610
happy,
vibrant kid parking on the railroad or

3097
02:08:17,100 --> 02:08:21,220
doing some bass and maybe it's just been
gross as whole life,

3098
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:23,290
but you see people as they get older.

3099
02:08:23,290 --> 02:08:26,090
My point is that if you live that
sedentary lifestyle and you sitting in

3100
02:08:26,091 --> 02:08:28,750
an office all day and if you're not
making your body work,

3101
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:32,800
it's going to fucking atrophy and it's
gonna break down and pick some stuff up.

3102
02:08:32,801 --> 02:08:34,570
Do some squats,
airport.

3103
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:37,150
When you go to the airport,
you realize how unhealthy this country

3104
02:08:37,151 --> 02:08:38,620
is because people are coming from
everywhere.

3105
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:41,470
I go to the air like what was just in
the airport in Ohio and I'm like,

3106
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:42,810
I'm.
There's not a lot of healthy.

3107
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:45,880
Ohio's awesome.
How about disneyland?

3108
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:51,160
And it's sad because you're only making
up one percent of the people.

3109
02:08:51,410 --> 02:08:53,070
If you see somebody who's kind of jackie
like,

3110
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:53,711
hey,
what's up man?

3111
02:08:53,711 --> 02:08:55,250
Because it's rarely,
only ones.

3112
02:08:55,870 --> 02:08:57,100
Well,
how about when you go to disneyland?

3113
02:08:57,101 --> 02:08:58,630
It seems like a scooter festival.
Now.

3114
02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:00,610
Everyone's on scooters.
These people,

3115
02:09:00,611 --> 02:09:03,610
there's so many people that have eaten
their way out of walking.

3116
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:06,150
They don't walk anymore.
They're oozing over the side.

3117
02:09:07,250 --> 02:09:10,210
It's what it is,
and you could say all day that it's a

3118
02:09:10,211 --> 02:09:12,190
disease.
You could say all but this.

3119
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:14,590
It's real simple.
You're putting too much food in your

3120
02:09:14,591 --> 02:09:16,120
body.
Your body is getting too big.

3121
02:09:16,330 --> 02:09:19,960
It's really simple.
Well getting so big that like fat is now

3122
02:09:19,961 --> 02:09:23,530
growing in some odd places and stuff.
I mean people's bodies are or not even

3123
02:09:23,950 --> 02:09:26,390
no longer in the shape of a of a normal
human being,

3124
02:09:26,391 --> 02:09:28,690
and I'm not trying to fat shame people,
but that's.

3125
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:31,330
That's the truth.
Don't even say that word because it's

3126
02:09:31,331 --> 02:09:33,310
not shaming.
It's so dumb.

3127
02:09:33,550 --> 02:09:36,730
If you shame them into losing weight,
that's probably beneficial to their

3128
02:09:36,731 --> 02:09:39,640
health.
That's not the way to do the best way to

3129
02:09:39,641 --> 02:09:41,530
do it necessarily,
but I think people,

3130
02:09:41,531 --> 02:09:43,240
because they're lazy,
fit shame people,

3131
02:09:43,241 --> 02:09:44,520
like they'll see him walking down the
street.

3132
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:47,010
They'll the first day that they'll
discount all the work,

3133
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:49,180
like all the steroids are now.
They'll say like,

3134
02:09:49,290 --> 02:09:50,380
you know,
that's not healthy.

3135
02:09:50,381 --> 02:09:51,980
Look at that guy or anybody that's
leading.

3136
02:09:51,981 --> 02:09:52,411
They're like,
oh,

3137
02:09:52,411 --> 02:09:53,900
he cares about it as a gym.
Well,

3138
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,840
not only that,
they think you're dumb because you

3139
02:09:55,841 --> 02:09:57,580
weren't going to meet him.
You must be dumb.

3140
02:09:57,730 --> 02:09:59,200
You know?
I know this guy is a bodybuilder,

3141
02:09:59,201 --> 02:10:00,610
but he's also.
He has a phd.

3142
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:03,930
Right?
And people will think he's dumb and

3143
02:10:03,970 --> 02:10:04,900
they're like,
oh my god,

3144
02:10:05,190 --> 02:10:06,580
we Just shut the fuck up.
You know,

3145
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:08,590
you just,
everybody wants everybody else to have

3146
02:10:08,591 --> 02:10:11,190
soMe sort of a deficit.
Like this guy's rich yet,

3147
02:10:11,191 --> 02:10:12,820
but I heard he's got no dick.
You.

3148
02:10:12,970 --> 02:10:13,803
Yeah,
exactly.

3149
02:10:13,870 --> 02:10:16,990
Always,
always have to play when they can't fInd

3150
02:10:16,991 --> 02:10:17,890
a flaw.
What do they say?

3151
02:10:18,090 --> 02:10:19,540
Dump con.
She's a bitch.

3152
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:26,580
She's a whore.
It's always going to be there.

3153
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:29,890
It's always going to be that.
But just I feel like people are more

3154
02:10:29,891 --> 02:10:32,320
conscious about their diet now than
they've ever been before and they're

3155
02:10:32,321 --> 02:10:34,130
more conscious about it because it's
kind of been

3156
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:37,250
getting out there in the public where it
didn't before,

3157
02:10:37,251 --> 02:10:38,250
you know,
it was like,

3158
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:40,790
no,
it is very important and it is hard to

3159
02:10:40,791 --> 02:10:44,450
go to a grocery store and find the
actual things.

3160
02:10:44,451 --> 02:10:45,081
Indeed,
you know,

3161
02:10:45,081 --> 02:10:47,180
like you want to get things that are,
you know,

3162
02:10:47,181 --> 02:10:49,880
they don't have preservatives or
whatever and you have to like look for

3163
02:10:49,881 --> 02:10:50,151
it,
you know?

3164
02:10:50,151 --> 02:10:52,400
So you're kind of a hunter gatherer
again,

3165
02:10:52,401 --> 02:10:54,800
trying to hunt in the grocery store for
the shit that's good.

3166
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:58,340
It's exciting for us because we've been
involved in this for over 20 years.

3167
02:10:58,490 --> 02:11:00,460
And then finally people are starting to,
we're like,

3168
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:01,790
oh shit,
they're talking about stuff.

3169
02:11:01,791 --> 02:11:03,830
We were talking about two decades ago.
How coMe?

3170
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:07,710
How come it's not mandatory to be taken
nutrition all through school?

3171
02:11:07,711 --> 02:11:10,460
Like it's just like ridiculous.
Like oh there's no time for that.

3172
02:11:10,461 --> 02:11:13,490
we have to teach you who the presidents
were and we got to teach you all this

3173
02:11:13,491 --> 02:11:16,850
other things that you're never going to
use and why not nutrition from a

3174
02:11:16,851 --> 02:11:20,630
documentary on sugar,
sugar,

3175
02:11:20,631 --> 02:11:21,464
sugar.

3176
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:24,320
Yeah.
I watched it with my kids were lIke,

3177
02:11:24,321 --> 02:11:26,660
what?
My sugar film at the same company,

3178
02:11:26,661 --> 02:11:30,020
samuel goldwyn that did prescription
thugs put that out and it's cool because

3179
02:11:30,021 --> 02:11:32,510
that company is just looking for
important things to put out.

3180
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:34,190
It's very,
very important.

3181
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:36,510
The sugars are crazy.
My kids,

3182
02:11:36,520 --> 02:11:38,460
when they were really young that you
know,

3183
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:40,520
certain amount of food and excess,
you know,

3184
02:11:40,521 --> 02:11:43,130
junk food is gonna make you fat.
I kept saYing that over and over again.

3185
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:45,350
Now they're older,
so I don't say it because I don't want

3186
02:11:45,351 --> 02:11:47,240
them to have some sort of weird complex
about it anymore,

3187
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:50,810
but they know they got the information.
They get the message got across.

3188
02:11:50,811 --> 02:11:54,500
They're eight and 12 now and so we're
kind of just put it in their head.

3189
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:57,920
That feeling that you get,
that feels good when you take it in

3190
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:02,180
healthy versus getting sick and so on,
but the feeling that you get that feels

3191
02:12:02,181 --> 02:12:04,250
good.
when you eat sugary foods like that

3192
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:08,240
corresponds with a crash and that
crashes really bad for you.

3193
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:10,280
Right?
so like now think about that.

3194
02:12:10,281 --> 02:12:11,900
Next time you eat ice cream,
I can enjoy it,

3195
02:12:12,140 --> 02:12:14,870
but understand that you're doing
something bad to your body because most

3196
02:12:14,871 --> 02:12:15,950
kids don't know.
They just,

3197
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:19,310
they just the good part and then they
have to realize one day that there's a

3198
02:12:19,311 --> 02:12:20,920
bad part to it,
to the.

3199
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:23,320
You have to teach them that if you mix
it with painkillers,

3200
02:12:23,321 --> 02:12:24,154
it feels great.

3201
02:12:26,450 --> 02:12:27,950
That was the other thing in your
documentary,

3202
02:12:27,951 --> 02:12:31,290
they're showing the kids,
you know how quickly they get kids on

3203
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:34,990
like children's claraton
disapprove,

3204
02:12:36,060 --> 02:12:39,410
approve oxycontin for like 11 to 16 year
olds.

3205
02:12:39,411 --> 02:12:41,720
Yeah.
Well here's what the problem is,

3206
02:12:41,721 --> 02:12:43,580
here's what people are saying and it's
bullshit.

3207
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:44,631
They're like,
oh well,

3208
02:12:44,631 --> 02:12:48,660
it just makes it easier for a doctor to
prescribe oxycontin to a cancer patient.

3209
02:12:48,661 --> 02:12:51,620
Like you're telling me that the fda is
going to come down and a doctor for

3210
02:12:51,621 --> 02:12:53,920
prescribing oxycontin to,
as you know,

3211
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:56,240
he's going to die from cancer.
Like I don't think so.

3212
02:12:56,241 --> 02:12:56,841
Like,
I don't know,

3213
02:12:56,841 --> 02:12:58,520
maybe maybe they are,
but like,

3214
02:12:58,521 --> 02:13:02,210
it's so crazy because all that's going
to do is create a bigger epidemic.

3215
02:13:02,260 --> 02:13:04,640
Yeah.
They're very aware of them for sales.

3216
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:06,050
Yeah.
I think they're very aware of that.

3217
02:13:06,051 --> 02:13:08,210
I don't think that's something that
needed to happen.

3218
02:13:08,211 --> 02:13:09,550
I think that,
you know,

3219
02:13:09,570 --> 02:13:11,570
these kids that we've been thought of
that.

3220
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:14,240
Yeah,
some fucking monster to somebody that

3221
02:13:14,241 --> 02:13:15,700
makes.
That makes the drug right.

3222
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:18,710
No one else hAs.
The lobbies are the Most powerful thing

3223
02:13:18,711 --> 02:13:20,090
in the world.
and that's what's.

3224
02:13:20,270 --> 02:13:22,820
Was there anything,
anything surprising when you were doing

3225
02:13:22,821 --> 02:13:24,560
this documentary?
Was there anything that really,

3226
02:13:25,250 --> 02:13:27,320
really took you by surprise?
Yeah,

3227
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:28,173
I think,
I think,

3228
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:30,520
uh,
what took me by surprise,

3229
02:13:30,550 --> 02:13:33,930
I relapsed during the documentary.
That was something that I didn't think

3230
02:13:33,931 --> 02:13:35,100
would happen.
But,

3231
02:13:35,101 --> 02:13:36,150
um,
that was,

3232
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:37,850
that was the trigger.
What start,

3233
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:40,830
what was it?
The hip replacement know what happened

3234
02:13:40,831 --> 02:13:41,664
was,
uh,

3235
02:13:41,670 --> 02:13:42,510
I.
Okay.

3236
02:13:42,511 --> 02:13:46,590
So I was taking a lot of prescription
painkillers right from my hip

3237
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:49,530
replacement surgery.
Fast forward about five years.

3238
02:13:49,531 --> 02:13:51,210
I'm on them for a pretty long time.
actually.

3239
02:13:51,211 --> 02:13:54,750
Had to get my right hip replaced again.
So I had three hip surgeries,

3240
02:13:54,751 --> 02:13:57,330
not just to have both hips done and then
another,

3241
02:13:57,331 --> 02:13:59,040
you know,
another hip two years later.

3242
02:13:59,160 --> 02:14:01,290
So it was constantly painkiller,
painkiller,

3243
02:14:01,291 --> 02:14:03,570
painkiller because dr after the first
hip surgery,

3244
02:14:03,571 --> 02:14:06,840
never knew what was wrong with me.
There's just this perpetual cycle,

3245
02:14:06,841 --> 02:14:07,171
oh,
hey,

3246
02:14:07,171 --> 02:14:08,790
your hip is.
Two years later,

3247
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:09,624
my doctor called me,
said,

3248
02:14:09,650 --> 02:14:10,530
oh,
you know what,

3249
02:14:10,531 --> 02:14:11,610
we screwed that up.
I'm sorry.

3250
02:14:11,611 --> 02:14:15,390
There's actually you're the socket never
grew in properly and it's moving and

3251
02:14:15,391 --> 02:14:18,690
that's why you're having so much pain.
I felt like I felt like I was on fire

3252
02:14:18,691 --> 02:14:19,770
for two years,
you know,

3253
02:14:19,771 --> 02:14:21,330
like my,
my hip was on fire.

3254
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:22,583
So,
um,

3255
02:14:22,650 --> 02:14:25,350
that was a big part of the drug
addiction.

3256
02:14:25,351 --> 02:14:28,110
And then I basically,
by my best friend,

3257
02:14:28,111 --> 02:14:28,911
leland was,
uh,

3258
02:14:28,911 --> 02:14:30,240
a guy who,
uh,

3259
02:14:30,241 --> 02:14:30,630
he,
uh,

3260
02:14:30,630 --> 02:14:31,350
he was,
you know,

3261
02:14:31,350 --> 02:14:33,670
he was prescribed painkillers to and he
knew what he was doing.

3262
02:14:33,950 --> 02:14:36,240
He knew it was never wanting to overdo
it,

3263
02:14:36,270 --> 02:14:37,300
you know.
Um,

3264
02:14:37,410 --> 02:14:39,420
but I just remember one day,
uh,

3265
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:41,340
I told him like,
I need to quit these.

3266
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:42,600
I'm going to die,
you know,

3267
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:44,610
and he,
he would get prescribed painkillers.

3268
02:14:44,611 --> 02:14:46,950
So I would try to get them from him and
he would say,

3269
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:47,251
no,
no,

3270
02:14:47,251 --> 02:14:48,270
I've,
I've cut you off,

3271
02:14:48,271 --> 02:14:49,104
you know,
you're done.

3272
02:14:49,290 --> 02:14:51,410
and I just realized I needed to get off
those painkillers.

3273
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:53,460
I was going to die.
So I went on suboxone and that was like

3274
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:57,450
another year on suboxone and then while
I was on suboxone that doctor put me on

3275
02:14:57,451 --> 02:15:00,690
like eight other drugs,
like a columbia pan and all these other

3276
02:15:00,691 --> 02:15:03,030
powerful crazy drugs where I banged up
my car,

3277
02:15:03,470 --> 02:15:04,231
you know,
driving around.

3278
02:15:04,231 --> 02:15:07,290
So it was like a constant,
perpetual mixed of these prescription

3279
02:15:07,291 --> 02:15:09,810
drugs.
And then I decided to get off everything

3280
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:14,670
and get clean and I felt like when I did
get clean I felt like I could never

3281
02:15:14,671 --> 02:15:16,860
sleep.
So I started drinking like a fish,

3282
02:15:16,910 --> 02:15:19,260
you know,
I was drinking vodka full thing of vodka

3283
02:15:19,261 --> 02:15:20,490
every day to sleep.

3284
02:15:20,550 --> 02:15:23,300
He had to go to sleep and stop My mind
from racing.

3285
02:15:23,310 --> 02:15:26,190
Yeah.
Did that to work and that didn't work.

3286
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:28,800
so I'm.
So it became a very heavy.

3287
02:15:28,801 --> 02:15:33,630
I became a very heavy drinker and um,
I would get these crazy hangovers and

3288
02:15:33,631 --> 02:15:34,920
that's what I just said,
you know,

3289
02:15:34,921 --> 02:15:36,360
what cures the hangover?
Xanax.

3290
02:15:36,361 --> 02:15:36,830
Wow.
That's,

3291
02:15:36,830 --> 02:15:39,110
that really works for me.
And um,

3292
02:15:39,330 --> 02:15:43,080
I would go on craigslist and I would buy
xanax from a kid in sun valley,

3293
02:15:43,081 --> 02:15:44,820
which is like way the fuck out from
venice.

3294
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:48,270
You can buy xanax on craigslist.
Has that x oxycontin.

3295
02:15:48,271 --> 02:15:50,060
I showed,
I showed that in my documentary that

3296
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:52,570
that was something that does.
The congressman was like,

3297
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:54,200
whoa,
in the movie.

3298
02:15:54,201 --> 02:15:55,260
Yeah.
And then they stopped doing it.

3299
02:15:55,261 --> 02:15:57,030
But you were like,
I knew about it because I was doing it.

3300
02:15:57,090 --> 02:15:58,680
Yeah.
And what happened was I lied to him.

3301
02:15:58,680 --> 02:15:59,080
I said,
you know,

3302
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:01,710
I used to do that like three years ago.
I just did it three days ago.

3303
02:16:03,330 --> 02:16:05,220
And you'll become a good liar,
you know,

3304
02:16:05,221 --> 02:16:07,460
when you're addicted to drugs.
And I was trying,

3305
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:09,120
it was weird.
It was a weird thing.

3306
02:16:09,121 --> 02:16:11,730
I was trying to make a difference,
but I was still doing shit,

3307
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:12,810
you know,
I didn't know how to stop.

3308
02:16:12,870 --> 02:16:17,010
That just seems so crazy that you could
buy drugs on craigslist.

3309
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:18,240
That's insane.
Yeah.

3310
02:16:19,230 --> 02:16:20,330
I say in the movie,
like they,

3311
02:16:20,380 --> 02:16:24,050
they had shut down the whole
prostitution thing on craigslist.

3312
02:16:24,060 --> 02:16:25,800
Why don't they just shut down selling
drugs,

3313
02:16:25,801 --> 02:16:27,420
you know?
Why did they shut down the prostitution

3314
02:16:27,421 --> 02:16:28,260
thing?
I don't know.

3315
02:16:28,700 --> 02:16:32,000
Seemed like a great idea.
It just went over to backpage.com now.

3316
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:33,070
yeah.
Now you,

3317
02:16:33,220 --> 02:16:34,480
you let everybody know,
hey,

3318
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:36,220
there's a service.
Was there anything else that was

3319
02:16:36,221 --> 02:16:37,240
surprising?
We were doing it.

3320
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:39,033
I mean,
I just,

3321
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:41,200
I think a lot of it was surprising like
that the woman,

3322
02:16:41,201 --> 02:16:43,990
glen olsen,
who was the pharma rep who basically,

3323
02:16:43,991 --> 02:16:44,660
uh,
yeah,

3324
02:16:44,660 --> 02:16:46,610
there was,
there was so many things that like,

3325
02:16:46,630 --> 02:16:50,320
I always thought that a lot of the stuff
I was going to present in the movie was

3326
02:16:50,321 --> 02:16:52,290
a conspiracy theory.
You know,

3327
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:56,410
like people are gonna think I'm crazy,
but then you find so much proof that

3328
02:16:56,860 --> 02:17:00,340
like you're being lied to that it's
crazy that the proof keeps mounting.

3329
02:17:00,341 --> 02:17:02,350
And that was,
that was always surprising to me.

3330
02:17:02,351 --> 02:17:03,290
How,
uh,

3331
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:07,270
every sort of corner I would turn in the
movie,

3332
02:17:07,510 --> 02:17:08,140
I'd be like,
well,

3333
02:17:08,140 --> 02:17:11,800
this is something else that's messed up.
And then trying to get people to be in a

3334
02:17:11,801 --> 02:17:13,020
movie and talk about their,
uh,

3335
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:15,610
their drug use isn't,
is that isn't ever easy.

3336
02:17:15,730 --> 02:17:16,750
You know,
that's always a problem.

3337
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:18,700
Yeah.
That woman was really,

3338
02:17:18,730 --> 02:17:21,460
really.
It was really profound.

3339
02:17:21,580 --> 02:17:23,800
It was really intense.
But one of the things that she said,

3340
02:17:23,801 --> 02:17:25,690
what she was talking about,
are you worried that they're going to

3341
02:17:25,691 --> 02:17:26,321
kill you?
She goes,

3342
02:17:26,321 --> 02:17:28,240
no,
I'm worried that they're gonna kill you

3343
02:17:28,241 --> 02:17:31,000
and you and you and you,
and I'm going to be screaming from the

3344
02:17:31,001 --> 02:17:33,000
rooftops and no one's going to care.
Yeah.

3345
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:34,570
That sounds crazy.
But It,

3346
02:17:34,571 --> 02:17:37,270
the whole time people were saying,
aren't you afraid they're going to kill

3347
02:17:37,271 --> 02:17:38,104
you?
And I said,

3348
02:17:38,140 --> 02:17:40,390
if they kill me because I made a movie
about prescription drugs,

3349
02:17:40,630 --> 02:17:42,190
that just proves the point,
you know,

3350
02:17:42,191 --> 02:17:43,240
like,
I'm not afraid.

3351
02:17:43,420 --> 02:17:46,570
I'm not gonna live my life and I'm not
going to live my life in fear because of

3352
02:17:46,740 --> 02:17:49,480
I'm going to make something and tell the
truth and somebody's going to kill me.

3353
02:17:49,481 --> 02:17:50,860
That'd be like the worst way to live
your life.

3354
02:17:50,980 --> 02:17:52,900
not only that,
it's not like they have a team of

3355
02:17:52,901 --> 02:17:55,010
assassins working for a pharmaceutical
company.

3356
02:17:55,430 --> 02:17:57,580
They don't.
They don't have to kill you because

3357
02:17:57,581 --> 02:17:59,600
there's going to keep making billions of
data.

3358
02:17:59,630 --> 02:18:02,860
We don't care like your.
Your documentary is profound as it is.

3359
02:18:02,861 --> 02:18:05,950
It's only going to put a dent and maybe
one percent of the people that would be

3360
02:18:05,951 --> 02:18:07,930
thinking about taking those drugs.
Exactly.

3361
02:18:08,130 --> 02:18:09,070
I mean,
that's the problem.

3362
02:18:09,071 --> 02:18:10,900
YeaH.
Well we can hope is that one percent

3363
02:18:10,901 --> 02:18:15,901
will be 10 percent in a few years and 20
percent in a decade or more and maybe

3364
02:18:16,030 --> 02:18:18,620
other people continue to make these
documentaries and I've covered,

3365
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:20,110
you know,
new information in it.

3366
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:21,820
The thing is Like,
you know,

3367
02:18:21,821 --> 02:18:22,690
yeah.
Like you said,

3368
02:18:22,691 --> 02:18:25,180
they're going to keep making money.
They're going to keep their basically

3369
02:18:25,181 --> 02:18:26,350
printing money anyway.
You know,

3370
02:18:26,351 --> 02:18:28,660
they're going to just keep doing it.
It's scary shit,

3371
02:18:28,661 --> 02:18:29,050
man.

3372
02:18:29,050 --> 02:18:33,370
It's scary shit to watch scary shit to,
to see peopLe that,

3373
02:18:33,371 --> 02:18:34,960
you know,
get hooked on these things,

3374
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:37,060
you know,
and it's scary shit too.

3375
02:18:37,061 --> 02:18:39,250
Like that.
The guy that I was talking about where

3376
02:18:39,251 --> 02:18:40,750
I'm like,
what is going on with this guy?

3377
02:18:40,751 --> 02:18:42,400
And then one day he tells me about his
back.

3378
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:44,440
I'm Like,
oh,

3379
02:18:45,090 --> 02:18:46,510
how many people are walking around like
that?

3380
02:18:46,511 --> 02:18:48,190
And when people are driving their cars
like that,

3381
02:18:48,220 --> 02:18:49,940
I mean you'll see out of their head.
I,

3382
02:18:49,941 --> 02:18:50,621
I,
you know,

3383
02:18:50,621 --> 02:18:51,550
when I'm,
like I said,

3384
02:18:51,580 --> 02:18:53,440
when people,
when you do a movie like this,

3385
02:18:53,441 --> 02:18:58,210
it becomes a confessional and you will
be shocked at the people who were doing

3386
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:02,930
the same exact thing as I was doing that
like would look down on me for.

3387
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:04,390
BecauSe it was,
oh well you were a drug addict.

3388
02:19:04,391 --> 02:19:07,000
Like I'm not addicted to it.
Like I hear people saY that all the

3389
02:19:07,001 --> 02:19:08,110
time.
Like I'm not addicted though.

3390
02:19:08,111 --> 02:19:08,980
I'm like,
yeaH,

3391
02:19:08,981 --> 02:19:12,250
but that's what you're going to.
Something that was prescribed by a

3392
02:19:12,251 --> 02:19:13,930
doctor.
Maybe you don't feel like a drug addict

3393
02:19:15,670 --> 02:19:16,501
on the streets,
man.

3394
02:19:16,501 --> 02:19:19,060
Yes.
I know a lady who thinks she looks down

3395
02:19:19,061 --> 02:19:21,340
on marijuana,
like in a big way and she just talks

3396
02:19:21,341 --> 02:19:24,280
trash about it,
but she takes a xanax every night when I

3397
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:27,100
can't go to.
When I started the movie,

3398
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:27,980
I was exact same

3399
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:30,260
way.
I always thought we always thought,

3400
02:19:30,430 --> 02:19:31,730
uh,
in our high school,

3401
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:34,550
marijuana was for all the dirt bags.
Like I felt.

3402
02:19:34,551 --> 02:19:37,400
I thought that for so long and now I
look at him like,

3403
02:19:37,401 --> 02:19:40,730
did I miss the boat on that?
Like maybe what was I doing,

3404
02:19:41,090 --> 02:19:44,030
drinking and taking all these pills when
something was there,

3405
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:46,220
you didn't want to be a loser.
And that's what we're,

3406
02:19:46,370 --> 02:19:48,140
it was drilled into our head when we
were kids.

3407
02:19:48,530 --> 02:19:50,570
People who smoke pot or losers and I
think,

3408
02:19:50,571 --> 02:19:51,800
um,
I think marijuana,

3409
02:19:52,070 --> 02:19:56,150
there's a slippery slope with marijuana
because now that it's become more

3410
02:19:56,151 --> 02:19:57,500
accepted,
medical marijuana,

3411
02:19:57,501 --> 02:20:00,740
in some states it's legal,
now they're just ramping it up and make

3412
02:20:00,741 --> 02:20:02,440
it stronger and stronger and stronger.
You know,

3413
02:20:02,510 --> 02:20:05,330
anything that alters your,
your consciousness can be problematic.

3414
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:07,190
Yeah.
It'd be beneficial or it can be

3415
02:20:07,191 --> 02:20:08,030
problematic.
Yeah.

3416
02:20:08,150 --> 02:20:11,180
The only good thing about marijuana,
it doesn't have a physical addictive

3417
02:20:11,181 --> 02:20:13,580
property to it.
Will your body desires it in a way where

3418
02:20:13,581 --> 02:20:16,400
you're going to start sucking dicks and
robin people for it,

3419
02:20:16,790 --> 02:20:19,400
but it's certainly become problem.

3420
02:20:23,090 --> 02:20:26,750
Wasn't that in like half baked,
half baked.

3421
02:20:27,740 --> 02:20:31,880
I think that anything can be addictive.
Gambling can be addictive,

3422
02:20:31,910 --> 02:20:32,743
you know,
food,

3423
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:34,080
porn,
you know,

3424
02:20:34,090 --> 02:20:37,520
when people get obsessed with things
that's addiction in a way,

3425
02:20:37,570 --> 02:20:39,800
you know,
you can get obsessed with all kinds of

3426
02:20:39,860 --> 02:20:42,560
healthy or unhealthy things.
And uh,

3427
02:20:42,660 --> 02:20:44,230
you know,
I think that what,

3428
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:49,440
what we're seeing with this documentary
is a world that has been growing.

3429
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:52,190
Um,
it's a,

3430
02:20:52,191 --> 02:20:57,191
it's an epidemic that's been growing
that we're just not getting that much

3431
02:20:57,471 --> 02:21:02,180
exposure to in the mainstream.
We're not hearing these numbers.

3432
02:21:02,181 --> 02:21:04,940
We're not hearing these statistics that
you presented in this movie.

3433
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:10,160
The statistics about the $250 million
prescriptions a year.

3434
02:21:10,810 --> 02:21:13,370
Just that.
And what's sad is like they put people

3435
02:21:13,371 --> 02:21:16,700
on this endless cycle all the time.
Like chris liebing Who's in the movie

3436
02:21:16,701 --> 02:21:17,600
ufc,
you know,

3437
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:18,950
uh,
he was,

3438
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:20,750
he was awesome to talk to is great.

3439
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:22,610
And then I talked to him like not that
long ago,

3440
02:21:22,611 --> 02:21:25,400
you've gotten in some trouble.
So I called them and to see how he's

3441
02:21:25,401 --> 02:21:27,960
doing and like,
it sucks because he's still on suboxone

3442
02:21:27,961 --> 02:21:28,791
and I'm like,
eh,

3443
02:21:28,791 --> 02:21:31,040
you don't like that's a drug that,
you know,

3444
02:21:31,430 --> 02:21:34,070
he's on it now.
He said he told him he was still on it

3445
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:35,990
and he's still drinking once in a while
until it's taking that.

3446
02:21:36,230 --> 02:21:38,510
And it sucks because he's,
he's a cool guy,

3447
02:21:38,511 --> 02:21:39,440
you know,
he's a great guy,

3448
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:41,390
a little reckless here and there,
but he was,

3449
02:21:41,750 --> 02:21:44,960
he was so awesome to talk to.
You actually became a friend through

3450
02:21:44,961 --> 02:21:47,480
doing the movie.
And I always worry about my friends,

3451
02:21:47,481 --> 02:21:50,060
like I don't want them to still be on
stuff or still be taking stuff,

3452
02:21:50,061 --> 02:21:51,420
you know?
Yeah.

3453
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:55,160
I wanted to add that the reason why he
relapsed was because he tried to stop

3454
02:21:55,161 --> 02:21:58,760
everything cold Turkey on his own and he
stopped for seven days.

3455
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:00,920
Right.
And then that's when he,

3456
02:22:01,010 --> 02:22:03,470
that's when he relapsed.
So those people out there that think

3457
02:22:03,471 --> 02:22:05,840
they can do it by themselves,
he probably can't.

3458
02:22:05,870 --> 02:22:07,340
You probably need to try to seek some
help.

3459
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:10,370
It was a lot of people that are very
strong willed and they feel like I can

3460
02:22:10,371 --> 02:22:13,190
do it like some other pussies camp,
but I'm going to be able to do it and

3461
02:22:13,210 --> 02:22:15,950
you know,
I went through 90 days of rehab and I

3462
02:22:15,951 --> 02:22:19,550
came out and I've been sober for like 22
months and people in,

3463
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:22,850
you know,
in my circle say that's a miracle

3464
02:22:22,851 --> 02:22:24,920
because a lot of people don't even make
it that far,

3465
02:22:24,930 --> 02:22:28,500
so I'm just like,
I'm just trying to keep going and trying

3466
02:22:28,501 --> 02:22:31,140
to get healthier because I think it's
all a snowball effect.

3467
02:22:31,141 --> 02:22:35,310
You can go snowball effect downhill or
you can go snowball effect and you know,

3468
02:22:35,311 --> 02:22:38,670
beyond the rise and started doing
everything right and eating like you're

3469
02:22:38,671 --> 02:22:41,610
eating and using people like you,
like you're a big inspiration to me.

3470
02:22:41,610 --> 02:22:43,740
I listen to the show all the time.
I think it's awesome.

3471
02:22:43,950 --> 02:22:47,550
It's a great source of information.
I have a bunch of different things I do

3472
02:22:47,551 --> 02:22:51,540
every day and listen to and watch and
try to gain information from everybody,

3473
02:22:51,570 --> 02:22:52,720
you know,
become a better personal.

3474
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:54,630
Thanks.
I appreciate it and I do too.

3475
02:22:54,631 --> 02:22:58,830
I have a bunch of different podcasts
that I listen to and new sources that I

3476
02:22:58,860 --> 02:23:00,870
find and I think this is a cool time for
that,

3477
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:03,930
you know,
and it's a cool time for like a guy like

3478
02:23:03,931 --> 02:23:07,380
you can come on a podcast and just talk
for a few hours and explain everything

3479
02:23:07,381 --> 02:23:11,430
and be open and people hear this more
than a million people will hear this and

3480
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:13,830
it'll open their eyes to what this is
all about.

3481
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:17,040
I felt obligated to be open because I
felt like I did so much bad shit.

3482
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:18,210
Like,
like man,

3483
02:23:18,211 --> 02:23:22,080
I got to tell people about this and a
lot of people are afraid to be an open

3484
02:23:22,081 --> 02:23:25,680
book and I understand that the luxury I
have is I'm a nobody.

3485
02:23:25,681 --> 02:23:26,620
It doesn't matter.
You know?

3486
02:23:26,730 --> 02:23:28,440
I can tell you everything.
I have nothing to lose.

3487
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:30,420
Well,
you're not a nobody.

3488
02:23:30,421 --> 02:23:32,640
I mean you're a well known documentary
film maker,

3489
02:23:32,641 --> 02:23:36,090
but I think that it takes balls no
matter who you are to do what you did.

3490
02:23:36,091 --> 02:23:38,280
So thanks.
Thanks for the documentary.

3491
02:23:38,610 --> 02:23:41,040
Thanks for making two awesome
documentaries that I've seen.

3492
02:23:41,070 --> 02:23:45,600
I still haven't seen trophy trophy kids
because I have kids.

3493
02:23:45,610 --> 02:23:47,640
I don't know.
The other thing too is it's not over,

3494
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:48,391
you know,
he's still,

3495
02:23:48,391 --> 02:23:52,130
he's still working on his life,
still working on rebuilding and you

3496
02:23:52,131 --> 02:23:53,940
know,
I was a financial disaster.

3497
02:23:54,220 --> 02:23:55,830
We decided as a family,
you've had,

3498
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:58,170
you know,
family meetings to figure out how the

3499
02:23:58,171 --> 02:23:59,430
fuck do we help him,
you know,

3500
02:23:59,431 --> 02:24:04,050
so we all got together and now they
actually moved him out of this pit of la

3501
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:06,240
and moved him to sacramento.

3502
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:09,510
He lives in sacramento now and davis,
he lives down the street from me and he

3503
02:24:09,511 --> 02:24:11,820
works for me now.
So we're just producing content for my

3504
02:24:11,821 --> 02:24:14,700
youtube channel and just cranking out
awesome information.

3505
02:24:14,701 --> 02:24:17,100
We'll probably do some documentary style
things as well.

3506
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:21,060
It's funny because I inspired him to
start working out when he was 12 years

3507
02:24:21,061 --> 02:24:23,790
old and um,
and now he inspires me.

3508
02:24:23,791 --> 02:24:25,200
I mean,
he was a dyslexic kid.

3509
02:24:25,470 --> 02:24:26,303
He was,
you know,

3510
02:24:26,430 --> 02:24:28,170
his car.
He's worth millions of dollars now.

3511
02:24:28,171 --> 02:24:31,440
It's crazy because he was always told he
couldn't do it.

3512
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:34,770
He wasn't smart enough and you're not
gonna make it and all that bullshit,

3513
02:24:34,771 --> 02:24:37,500
right that they tell you in school.
They put you in a class with the kids

3514
02:24:37,501 --> 02:24:40,580
that are eating glue and he invented
sundance gunfire.

3515
02:24:40,710 --> 02:24:41,780
It's almost like,
yeah,

3516
02:24:41,790 --> 02:24:43,510
it's almost like a meat head version of,
uh,

3517
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:44,640
of the jerk,
the movie,

3518
02:24:44,641 --> 02:24:45,330
the jerk.

3519
02:24:45,330 --> 02:24:48,270
He invented a thing that helps you bench
press More weight without getting hurt

3520
02:24:48,271 --> 02:24:51,090
and boom.
And I think that it's an important

3521
02:24:51,091 --> 02:24:53,970
message for people to follow what
they're passionate about.

3522
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:57,210
Not always worry so much about money
because money came because he followed

3523
02:24:57,211 --> 02:25:00,450
what he loved to do that don't give up
on shit.

3524
02:25:00,451 --> 02:25:01,980
Don't give up on the people that you
love.

3525
02:25:01,981 --> 02:25:03,750
don't give up on the people that you
care about.

3526
02:25:04,170 --> 02:25:06,450
we lost one.
I'm lucky to still have him here.

3527
02:25:06,810 --> 02:25:09,360
He's my hero.
My other brother was my hero as well.

3528
02:25:09,770 --> 02:25:12,750
Just you got to take value in the people
that are around you.

3529
02:25:12,751 --> 02:25:15,510
And there's,
there's inspiration and motivation to be

3530
02:25:15,511 --> 02:25:19,290
found all over the fucking place.
Stop being so god damn grumpy and

3531
02:25:19,291 --> 02:25:23,200
getting on youtube and talking shit.
I saw your bid that made me fucking

3532
02:25:23,201 --> 02:25:25,630
almost cries laughing so hard because
you're like,

3533
02:25:25,631 --> 02:25:28,390
all you gotta do is close your
motherfucking laptop,

3534
02:25:28,530 --> 02:25:29,363
bitch.

3535
02:25:29,410 --> 02:25:30,243
Yeah,
that's right.

3536
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:31,930
But you know.
Anyway.

3537
02:25:31,931 --> 02:25:33,640
Yeah.
Just just try to be positive and a lot

3538
02:25:33,641 --> 02:25:36,220
of great things surrounding you.
Open your fucking eyes.

3539
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:39,660
He went to your show for his birthday
and his,

3540
02:25:39,730 --> 02:25:40,780
him and his wife,
they love it.

3541
02:25:40,781 --> 02:25:43,900
They're laughing their asses off.
Julie diaz killed me.

3542
02:25:43,980 --> 02:25:45,550
Killed that,
that fucking guy.

3543
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:47,470
So he's like,
hey,

3544
02:25:47,480 --> 02:25:48,790
she.
The day that we come,

3545
02:25:48,820 --> 02:25:51,490
because his wife got an argument.
He's like,

3546
02:25:51,491 --> 02:25:55,560
we got the day.
I come back from they arnold enough for

3547
02:25:55,570 --> 02:25:56,403
a week.
Yeah.

3548
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:59,010
The day I come back,
I'm going to go to joe to joe rogan's

3549
02:25:59,011 --> 02:26:00,640
show.
Ah.

3550
02:26:00,850 --> 02:26:02,380
I don't really think it's that important
to go to.

3551
02:26:02,381 --> 02:26:05,710
Joe rogan is all through tech show.
A lot of miscommunication like in la,

3552
02:26:05,711 --> 02:26:07,030
like Why is that so important?
He's like,

3553
02:26:07,031 --> 02:26:08,680
well,
I'm going to go to a show and it'll be

3554
02:26:08,681 --> 02:26:09,910
awesome.

3555
02:26:09,911 --> 02:26:11,140

3559
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:21,533

3563
02:26:26,921 --> 02:26:27,820
he was like,

3564
02:26:27,821 --> 02:26:28,900
okay.
That makes sense.

3565
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:29,790
You know?
