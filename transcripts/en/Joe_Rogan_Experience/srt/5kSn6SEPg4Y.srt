1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,210
The Joe Rogan experience,
we just,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,340
we just adapted to our environment.
This is one reason why Chinese people

3
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:08,540
have like really skinny eyes.
I don't know what it is,

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,370
but whatever the reason is why they like
to develop that,

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,690
that thin slit where you're,
you know,

6
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:18,890
you don't have like this big wide eye
and develop like a less hairy body.

7
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:20,600
Whatever those reasons are.
I don't know what they are,

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,140
but that had to thank God for them.
Well,

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,320
I had
one woman,

10
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:29,270
like every one of those attributes,
the little,

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,400
the little slitty eyes,
so she can't,

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,150
she can't see that I have no hair
because she can only see the middle part

13
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:39,860
of my face and she's got no hair,
so that's really nice.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,680
Beautiful Feet.
A lot of them do,

15
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:45,260
but there's some women that get their
feet bound.

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,410
That's an Asian thing to how they got so
nice.

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,020
They were,
they were bred to have little tiny sweet

18
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:51,854
feet.
They're not,

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,450
they're not like big American women feet
with the fucking Bunyan and like

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,690
endless,
like one toe that's longer than the

21
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:01,570
other one.
Doesn't bother me now.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,680
No,
it doesn't bother me at all,

23
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,160
but the crooked toes bothered me.
Yeah.

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,180
Shouldn't,
shouldn't really care.

25
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:10,440
I'm all broken up.
Why would I get yours?

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,270
Must be all fucked up from kicking
people then.

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,091
That's weird.
Yeah.

28
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:15,200
I don't have any.
Anything.

29
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,700
Is your feet smell go?
Oh,

30
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,500
definitely.
Who's don't?

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,270
Well,
if you have your feet don't smell.

32
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:22,490
It means you're not working.
You're not getting anything done.

33
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,930
I feel like mine smelled bad.
Like I just put spray everything and it

34
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:28,940
still comes back the next day.
If it's a health issue,

35
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,160
maybe she wears sandals thing,
man.

36
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,190
Well you know when your,
your feet are sitting in these like

37
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:35,660
polyester cotton socks.

38
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,520
Right?
And you're sweating and it's all just

39
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:40,880
brewing function there.
I mean when you have a plastic sock.

40
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,560
Okay.
That's what a nylon sockets.

41
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,150
Plastic socks on.
Is it?

42
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,800
Does anybody wear nylon socks?
I guess they do,

43
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,000
right?
They're kind of nylon,

44
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:47,810
right?
Yeah.

45
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,620
Ray on whatever fucking socks made out
of.

46
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,710
It's not made out of wool.
Okay.

47
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,470
And anything other than wool.
It's not going to accept all that

48
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:58,040
moisture and dry it up very well.
So things that get soupy in there,

49
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,550
like especially if they're like plastic,
cotton's pretty good about saying to

50
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,720
the,
to Mundo your balls smell Brian.

51
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,111
Uh,
no.

52
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:11,570
But if I take two showers a day,
but I was thinking they should have like

53
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:12,590
ball hats,
you know,

54
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,840
like where you put your balls and like a
little little sock.

55
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,550
Wouldn't that make all underwear dude?
Yeah.

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,640
But twitter doesn't like fuck he talking
about this thing that you put.

57
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,520
They're like smaller than pants and you
put them on there like shorter than

58
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,960
shorts.
Wait a minute.

59
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:27,920
Wait,
I feel you on this.

60
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,700
What would you call him?
Greg there under your clothes.

61
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,210
The ball socks,
socks.

62
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,830
And then they have like an opening.
What if there was like an opening you

63
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:40,610
can open for your penis to come out of
like it's there technically,

64
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,730
but the flap is so big that you actually
can't.

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,440
I'm,
I'm down dude.

66
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:46,274
Let's invest money.

67
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,010
You want to hear a crazy thing you're
talking about like intellectual

68
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:51,190
connection and stuff like that.
Um,

69
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,430
so coffee was invented in Ethiopia as we
said in,

70
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,070
in Ethiopia.
They do it like a coffee ceremony,

71
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,060
like a,
you know,

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,000
a very ceremonial way to prepare it and
drink it and when they do the coffee

73
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:04,900
ceremony,
they,

74
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,960
it's like they gather people together
from the village.

75
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:10,990
They and they talk about things.
They talk about the news of the village,

76
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,620
they talk about,
um,

77
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,710
things that are going on in the,
in the world.

78
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,040
When coffee moved from Ethiopia to
Yemen,

79
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,590
totally different deal.
Like in Ethiopia,

80
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:24,280
it's always a woman that makes coffee.
Whereas in Yemen it wasn't like that,

81
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,450
but they still would talk about news and
intellectual and stuff like that.

82
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,080
Then coffee moved from Yemen to Europe,
um,

83
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,100
you know,
Italy and England and places like that.

84
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,400
And the coffee house still remained a
place for intellectual exchange and

85
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,120
discourse and stuff like that.
They plan the American revolution in

86
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:47,740
coffee houses,
you know,

87
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,700
in

88
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,570
that's Kinda,
we're wired,

89
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:50,404
right?
Like fuck,

90
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,750
there's something.
But there's something about coffee that

91
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,780
like that like gets your mind going as
well as stimulates you and wakes you up.

92
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,860
But also the tea party movement like
that,

93
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,780
that had an effect on the way the United
States took off just by simply the fact

94
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:07,030
that they went from t to coughing.
That's the,

95
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,160
there is.
There are people that speculate that

96
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,130
that's totally valid.
Yeah.

97
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,960
That coffee consumption is a part of the
American,

98
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,870
uh,
drive to ingenuity and imagine

99
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,390
fucking speed.
We're country on speed.

100
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,720
I wonder if they could show gross
domestic product posts.

101
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:28,710
Starbucks.
Not starbucks impacted people's

102
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,090
productivity,
but still,

103
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,560
right.
If you go to meet somebody at a coffee

104
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:33,660
shop,
you're going to talk about something

105
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:37,710
that's different than going to drink
with somebody at a bar or have dinner

106
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,960
with somebody or something like that.
It's different.

107
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:42,510
It's somehow more about exchanging
information,

108
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:44,360
more imagination.
It's stimulating.

109
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,920
The stimulant of caffeine in coffee is
stimulating and then the flavor is

110
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:52,740
enriching.
You enjoy the flavor and then you get

111
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:56,040
fucking happy.
And it's been that way since the origin

112
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,881
of coffee.
Well,

113
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,410
coffee houses.
Yeah.

114
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,860
Coffeehouses were always thought of as
places where people read poetry and you

115
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:02,880
know.
Yeah.

116
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,820
And he politics,
etc. And as you said,

117
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,680
plan revolutions,
that's interesting to me.

118
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,940
YeAh,
it is interesting.

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,200
And that's one of the reasons that I
think that I like to work in coffee.

120
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,240
Like why?
What's one of the dumbest things the

121
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:18,350
government has ever done is try to keep
pot from people because you have,

122
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,760
you did smoke it,
you find out it's awesome.

123
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,940
You don't die.
And then you start distrusting

124
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,880
everything.
Right?

125
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,260
Well,
masturbation.

126
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,200
Think about how many people thought they
were going to die for masturbation.

127
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:29,520
right?
You lose your mind.

128
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:31,980
You get hair on your palms.
But when did that end?

129
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,660
That wasn't my time.
No.

130
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,680
Well,
no,

131
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,141
no,
I'm talking.

132
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,340
I'm talking about earlier times,
early 20th century,

133
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:39,560
19th century.
You know,

134
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,220
I remember her that you were going to go
blind,

135
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:41,971
right?
Oh yeah,

136
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:43,950
there were.
There are medical books in the 19th

137
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,830
century.
Kellogg had this whole thing about it.

138
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:47,391
You know,
the,

139
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,780
the causes,
insanity,

140
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,960
insanity.
It causes hair to grow in your palms.

141
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,520
You know,
just a weird ability locked.

142
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,280
Is this kellogg from kellogg cereal,
right?

143
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,760
Yeah,
he had a thing.

144
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,680
He was very sick.
You ever see that?

145
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,350
The road to wellville pea did people who
masturbate.

146
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,860
You had a thing about that.
I mean the whole thing with cornflakes,

147
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,140
cornflakes were invented was to stop
boys from masturbating.

148
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,080
how was that?
How was the idea behind that?

149
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,360
Explained this to us before then?
The idea is that spicy foods excite the

150
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:20,610
sensibilities and so if you eat
something that tastes interesting and

151
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:25,370
you're going to want to come so they can
pet and also graham crackers.

152
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,480
Graham was another these big aunty
masturbation evangelizers,

153
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:32,930
