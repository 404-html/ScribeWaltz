1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,560
Five four,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,753
three,

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,773
two,

4
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,450
one.

5
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,130
Tj.

6
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,640
Yo,

7
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,270
how are you brother?

8
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,103
I'm doing good man.

9
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,310
What is it like now?

10
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:08,941
What is this?

11
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:09,760
Uh,

12
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,100
what,

13
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,190
what first of all,

14
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,570
what was it like that night?

15
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,980
If for people don't know,

16
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,270
let me just give you the rundown just
so you don't have to say at co you were

17
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:22,650
involved in one of the most high
profile flyweight fights ever eat the

18
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:23,520
bantamweight champion.

19
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,320
It dropped down to flyweight.

20
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,470
You went through this extensive training
routine to get your body down to a

21
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:35,880
manageable weight where you can cut the
last 10 pounds or so and make one 25 the

22
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:39,240
fight starts so Hutto
lands a good shot early.

23
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:39,910
There's a lot,

24
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,250
a lot of action,

25
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,750
and the referee stops the fight.

26
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,700
And I was,

27
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,470
I was shook by it.

28
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:47,860
Everybody that I was
watching the fight with,

29
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:48,420
it was like,

30
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,200
what the fuck didn't,

31
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,410
it was almost universal.

32
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:53,820
Like no one thought it was a good stop.

33
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:58,400
It's just one of those stoppages
where no one goes as a good stop it,

34
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,070
stop it.

35
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,670
No one.

36
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,331
Everybody was like,

37
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:00,931
what the fuck?

38
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:01,950
You jumped off and you're like,

39
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:02,251
dude,

40
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:02,910
come on.

41
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,840
Come on man.

42
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,040
It's been rough man.

43
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:05,641
That's a rough one.

44
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:07,080
That won't rough one to swallow on,

45
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:08,370
on multiple reasons,

46
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:08,851
you know?

47
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:09,300
Um,

48
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:09,850
like you say,

49
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,210
he fell,

50
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,340
he landed a good shot.

51
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,293
Um,

52
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:12,990
the,

53
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,240
the,

54
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,120
everything is being
overshadowed by this shot.

55
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:16,170
The landing behind my ear,

56
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,730
you know,

57
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,460
um,

58
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,470
I was over off,

59
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,560
balanced it through a right hand.

60
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:20,730
I came in a little too aggressive.

61
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:21,570
That's the way I fight,

62
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:21,751
right?

63
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:22,501
He pushed me over.

64
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:23,370
I was off balance.

65
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,301
He threw a kick,

66
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:27,360
I blocked it and he went to throw a right
hand and I tried to dip out of the way

67
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,370
and it was one of those shots
that hit you behind the head,

68
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,270
like right behind the ear.

69
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:30,991
Not Illegal,

70
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:31,801
but I run her feet.

71
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,540
It's completely illegal.

72
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:33,841
But,

73
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:34,260
uh,

74
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,640
it was an unfortunate situation.

75
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:38,070
One of those punches just kind of
takes her feet out from underneath you.

76
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,450
You're 100% there,

77
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,650
but your equilibrium's off,

78
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:40,891
you know?

79
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:41,790
And he jumps on me.

80
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,421
Um,

81
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:44,730
I remember hearing the ref say
Dillashaw show me something.

82
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:45,564
I told him I'm good.

83
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,150
And I remember talking to him before
the fight in the back and he said,

84
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:48,271
like,

85
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:49,110
if I'm telling you that,

86
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,130
make sure you're talking to me,

87
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:50,401
give me,

88
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,181
show me something,

89
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:51,720
you know,

90
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,790
but how are you talking?

91
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,521
I said it,

92
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:54,330
I said I'm good.

93
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:54,750
I mean,

94
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,250
but in his,

95
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,700
you know,

96
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:56,990
from,

97
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,500
from his perspective,

98
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:01,170
how does he expect you to
talk what you're blocking?

99
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,810
Even said too in the back
before the fight too.

100
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:03,961
Like,

101
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:04,111
you know,

102
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:06,930
give me a thumbs up or something if
you're going to choke this or that,

103
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:07,201
you know.

104
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:08,034
So,

105
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:08,820
uh,

106
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,301
to be honest,

107
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:09,780
I think he was,

108
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,081
I didn't,

109
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:10,831
I didn't know who he was.

110
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,480
I think he's really
inexperienced watching him.

111
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,930
Raf is well do jumping around as soon
as the commotion and it happened.

112
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:17,760
He was looking for a
reason to stop it almost.

113
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,870
Um,

114
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,980
but you know,

115
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:20,341
I can't,

116
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,180
I think it was amped up.

117
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,620
Yeah.

118
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,280
I mean it's a big fight fight for him to,

119
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:23,851
you know,

120
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:27,120
for him to get a high profile
fight first time on ESPN plus.

121
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:27,690
Yes.

122
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,350
Big Deal.

123
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,090
A hundred percent a hundred percent.

124
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:30,810
So that's the,

125
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,180
I think that's the part that most
bugs me more is that I was there.

126
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,020
Um,

127
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,820
but it was the shot that
hit me behind the head.

128
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,870
Um,

129
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,610
and then obviously the
controversial stoppage.

130
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:38,901
So it,

131
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:39,081
it's,

132
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:40,110
it's a rough one to swallow.

133
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:40,351
You know,

134
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:40,531
it's,

135
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:42,540
it's definitely been bugging me,

136
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:42,841
but,

137
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:43,111
uh,

138
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:46,410
I'm good about keeping my mind off of
things and staying busy and Modi back in

139
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:47,244
the gym,

140
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,790
um,

141
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,590
doing business things and uh,

142
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,800
trying to stay as busy as possible so I
don't think about it and want to punch a

143
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,360
hole through a wall
every time I walk by one.

144
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:54,721
Well,

145
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:55,090
it's such a two

146
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,090
different fight because it was
such an arduous task for you to get

147
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,000
down to flyweight.

148
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:01,181
I mean,

149
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:01,751
people are looking,

150
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,620
you look great right now.

151
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,580
Your face is full,

152
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,423
you look healthy.

153
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,381
But God damn,

154
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:05,591
dude,

155
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:08,470
I saw you the week of the fight
on television and I was like,

156
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,550
look at his face.

157
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,590
Got tweaker.

158
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,171
Yeah,

159
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:11,771
you did.

160
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:11,980
You,

161
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,030
you looked like you were,

162
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,630
uh,

163
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,021
you know,

164
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:14,501
so who knows?

165
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,101
Said it best.

166
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:16,620
You look like an ultra marathon runner.

167
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,820
Some guy who runs long distances.

168
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,300
If,

169
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,270
if I would have decided to
lose all the way at the end,

170
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:23,200
I wouldn't have looked like that.

171
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:23,440
Right.

172
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,380
But I got my buddy down
to five to 6% body fat,

173
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:26,710
you know,

174
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,020
so when I start losing
anything towards the end,

175
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:29,561
it's going to come.

176
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:30,790
You're going to see it out of my face.

177
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,041
Right.

178
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:31,391
You know,

179
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,970
and I'm one of those guys that loses
and gains weight out of my face.

180
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:34,660
You know,

181
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,351
after my fights,

182
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,760
we call myself fat Tyler.

183
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,821
Cause that's my,

184
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:38,800
my real name is Tyler.

185
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,640
And I go by Tj and Justin buckles
gave me that name back at Alpha male.

186
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,500
Like Tyler.

187
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,660
I'd always get puffy face,

188
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,880
watch my fights in my altar.

189
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,870
He goes fat Tyler,

190
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,570
you know,

191
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,450
I'm going out and eating
and being an asshole.

192
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,230
Um,

193
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,063
Spaghetti.

194
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,460
Yeah,

195
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,150
exactly.

196
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,983
Um,

197
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,741
but uh,

198
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:54,190
so when I,

199
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,761
when I decided to,

200
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,740
like if I did it over 12 weeks,

201
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,090
so my body weight was down,

202
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:58,770
I mean my,

203
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,020
my,

204
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,360
my body fat percentage is down to 5%.

205
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,021
That's crazy.

206
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:04,630
And so when you lose any
more waterway or anything,

207
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:07,690
you're going to see it come under your
face because I was doing it for so long

208
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,000
now.

209
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,580
What was it like being that low on
you as far as your body fat goes?

210
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,320
What was your performance like physically?

211
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,293
How'd you feel?

212
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,061
I actually,

213
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:19,750
so I felt the best I've ever felt
before I walked up before the fight,

214
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,910
and that's another reason why I'm just
so bitter about this thing is because I

215
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,220
didn't get a chance to show
the work that I put in.

216
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,910
I didn't get a chance to show
all the science behind Sam,

217
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,930
Kavita and what he did to my body.

218
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:35,110
I was stronger for this fight
then it was my last Cody fight.

219
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,800
I walked out two pounds heavier for this
fight than I did my last Cody fight.

220
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,970
What did you walk out too before I
started warming up a wade one 49 watts.

221
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:43,271
Yes,

222
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:43,961
and I felt great.

223
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,290
I didn't feel bloated and for nothing.

224
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,700
You went from one 25 to one 49 yeah,

225
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,500
I was a glycogen battery.

226
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:51,910
I was ready to fucking go.

227
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:53,320
I couldn't get tired before the fight.

228
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:54,460
When I was warming up in the back.

229
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,750
I seriously like,

230
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,910
I've never felt better
than this before a fight,

231
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,470
like my mood,

232
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:01,660
my energy levels like me
hitting mitts with Dwayne,

233
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:02,650
the back warming up,

234
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,760
I was feeling smooth,

235
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,431
I was feeling good.

236
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:08,410
I remember even walking out in the cage
and everything felt too good almost too.

237
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,000
I remember looking over
Duane smile on him.

238
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:10,840
I felt awesome.

239
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,950
Um,

240
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,740
and that's even more of an unfortunate
situation that I didn't get to really

241
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,670
show that,

242
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,300
you know?

243
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,690
Well,

244
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,051
I mean,

245
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:21,910
hats off to Henry because he's a course
he did catch you and he is one of the

246
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:22,630
best.

247
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,260
He's a,

248
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,800
I mean there's that kind
of caliber of athlete.

249
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,870
It was what made this fight so special.

250
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,360
You being the bantamweight
champion going down to flyweight.

251
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:31,990
Yep.

252
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,990
And I think the way you did it is probably
the only way to really do it safely.

253
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,543
For sure.

254
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:40,301
Yeah.

255
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:40,541
I mean,

256
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,880
I guess you were safe
because you were only,

257
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,451
you were like,

258
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:43,721
what,

259
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:47,740
one 35 ish the day before I made
weight the night before the fight.

260
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,290
Why we are not the night before a Wayans.

261
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,430
So I went to sleep,

262
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:51,910
uh,

263
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,710
1.3 pounds over and I floated
that actually took a shit
the morning or Wayne's,

264
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:57,620
which is insane.

265
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,401
That never happens.

266
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,780
Like my body was still working.

267
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,560
Um,

268
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,290
I wanted to make the weight the night
before cause obviously I hadn't made one

269
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:03,920
25.

270
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,860
I didn't want it to wake up in the morning
and see what my body was going to do

271
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:08,480
and if it was going to
give me that extra water.

272
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:08,991
Um,

273
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:09,590
but I made,

274
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,270
I made weight super easy man.

275
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,160
Like you don't get me wrong.

276
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:14,720
The 12 weeks was a motherfucker.

277
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,320
It was hard.

278
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,160
It was a lot of work.

279
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,130
But though the actual weight cut was easy.

280
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:20,030
I had no hiccups,

281
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,910
nothing like would tell me
like what to go to bed at.

282
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:24,380
He knew what I was going to wake up at.

283
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,750
He tells me the water loading I'm doing,

284
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,080
um,

285
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,700
the amount of electrolytes I'm taking in,

286
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,680
the amount of food I'm eating.

287
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,930
And so he knows exactly what
my buddies and wake up and do.

288
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,540
He's been tracking it for two years now.

289
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:35,911
That guy,

290
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:36,800
it sounds brilliant.

291
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,080
I really need to talk to him,

292
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,170
watched videos of him talking about it
and seeing the work and just what a,

293
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:44,870
what a unique individual he is.

294
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,630
I mean that's why I decided to move back
down to southern California for him.

295
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,190
For him.

296
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:48,830
Yeah.

297
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,450
And then everything else
kind of came along with it.

298
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,850
My life is wonderful now that
people have got around me.

299
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm lucky that I have Duane
Ludwig this willing to try it out,

300
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,930
travel out and train with me out there.

301
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:57,680
Um,

302
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,830
but I moved down to southern California
because the Sam Kalvia and I came down

303
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:03,530
to two weeks with him and
started noticing like,

304
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:03,731
damn,

305
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:04,640
this guy knows his shit.

306
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,563
You know,

307
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,280
I didn't realize uniquely,

308
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:07,490
no.

309
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,690
I mean there's a lot of people
out there who know their shit,

310
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,650
but he seems like he's on some new level.

311
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,610
I mean he sent me graphs that I
have on my phone of like the tea,

312
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,350
like he would,

313
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,870
he like to every week
we knew exactly what,

314
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,150
what my body weight wanted to be at.

315
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:23,330
He was telling me weights that I'd be
at before I would even be there and my

316
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:24,380
body would just do it,

317
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:24,831
you know.

318
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:25,150
Um,

319
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,900
so you didn't need a separate person,

320
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:27,500
so he's here.

321
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,210
This is what's unusual about this.

322
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,970
Normally if you would hire somebody,

323
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,311
you,

324
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:35,300
you would hire like a George
Lockhart or something like that,

325
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,970
Mike Dolce and then you would,

326
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,790
you would hire them almost specifically
just for the weight cut and some

327
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,780
nutrition advice.

328
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,120
He's training you physically as well.

329
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,860
He's telling me my low base,

330
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:46,041
like,

331
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:49,260
so my long distance running
or my fasted low base.

332
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:49,710
Yeah.

333
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,361
He does everything.

334
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:51,260
My strength conditioning,

335
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,281
my nutrition,

336
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:52,520
he,

337
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,720
they make my meals,

338
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,010
they do all my meal prep.

339
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,310
He's telling me like how much a
low base I need to do per week.

340
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,570
I either morning or night,

341
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,280
he's telling me when I should train.

342
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,090
Um,

343
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:02,361
it's,

344
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:03,080
uh,

345
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,310
everything is completely mapped out.

346
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:04,521
I don't,

347
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:05,690
there's no guesswork in it.

348
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:07,370
There's nothing like he's
telling me everything,

349
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:09,430
like he's listening to my
heart rate when I'm sleeping.

350
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,670
The heart rate variability is,

351
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,860
he's telling me what supplements to take.

352
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,550
Um,

353
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,210
all of it,

354
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:14,511
you know,

355
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:15,380
like everything.

356
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,441
I,

357
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:17,091
I seriously and,

358
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:17,530
and,

359
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,320
and I,

360
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,741
that's,

361
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:21,740
that's another reason why it's just so
tough that this fight didn't get to like

362
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:23,330
really let me prove anything,

363
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:25,100
not only for myself and who I am,

364
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:26,510
but the work that this guy put in,

365
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:26,931
you know,

366
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:29,990
like I'm going to sit here and brag about
him and tell him about how bad ass he

367
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:30,171
is.

368
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:31,310
But then people want to tell me like,

369
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:31,791
oh,

370
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,750
you're malnourished.

371
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,150
You don't have a chin one 25,

372
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:35,150
it was a bad cup for you.

373
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:36,980
They're giving him crap
all over the place.

374
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:37,911
And,

375
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:38,420
uh,

376
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,690
I've almost feel just as bad for him as
I do for myself for how much work you

377
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:42,171
put into it,

378
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:44,780
how actually how great
I felt before the fight.

379
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:45,890
And I didn't get a chance to show it.

380
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:46,251
Like I said,

381
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:49,580
I walked out at one 49
glycogen battery ready to go.

382
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,330
Um,

383
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,040
I've really never felt better.

384
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,181
I know,

385
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:53,960
man,

386
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,950
it was insane.

387
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,210
I,

388
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,920
I really couldn't believe like
how my body absorbed everything,

389
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,843
you know?

390
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,730
So what do you walking around like now?

391
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,170
I'm in low 15.

392
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,790
I'm in low fifties right now,

393
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,590
but that's because I'm
trying to be at low 50s.

394
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,510
My body instantly wanted to just store
everything and I got up to like sixties,

395
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,321
low sixties.

396
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:13,681
And I was like,

397
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:14,260
Oh shit.

398
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,720
I said,

399
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,211
I started doing,

400
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:16,040
I started doing some,

401
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,590
uh,

402
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,800
hot yoga and going in and where I
just worked out with Sam yesterday.

403
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,480
I'm going to his house later after this.

404
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:22,314
And also,

405
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,100
um,

406
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,270
that's kind of the only way my mind can
stay at ease right now with everything

407
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:29,100
that's been going on as I
need to get back in the gym.

408
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,440
What was that night
like after it was over?

409
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,861
I mean,

410
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:34,710
going back to your dressing room
and going back to your hotel.

411
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,550
Um,

412
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,061
it was rough,

413
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:36,894
man.

414
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,830
It was definitely a,

415
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:39,520
a mother fucker.

416
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,353
It was it.

417
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,671
I was pissed.

418
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:42,504
You know,

419
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,730
everyone wants to call me like a,

420
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:44,431
a sore loser.

421
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:45,750
I've never said I wasn't a sore loser.

422
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,730
I fucking hate losing more than any of,

423
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:48,141
I mean you,

424
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:52,290
you show me a champion or a high level
competitor that likes losing and I'll

425
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,124
call you a liar.

426
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,820
You know what I mean?

427
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,380
I think you're 100% correct.

428
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,180
And Jamie and I have talked
about this many times when we're,

429
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,520
you know,

430
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,620
we're talking about the broad
James or Michael Jordan,

431
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,480
those guys were infamous
for being terrible losers.

432
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,220
I hate losing.

433
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,351
Yeah.

434
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:06,840
I mean,

435
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,400
I just don't think you get to be that
elite of the elite unless you're a fucking

436
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:12,030
maniac.

437
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,270
Yeah.

438
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,260
I really think that,

439
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:13,471
I mean,

440
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:14,670
I think about it constantly.

441
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,941
You know,

442
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:16,080
I'm one of those OCD guys.

443
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:16,770
It's,

444
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,581
if I'm not in the gym,

445
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:18,331
I'm thinking about it.

446
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,480
I'm just thinking about my training and
sometimes I need to distract myself and

447
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:24,840
also I distract myself with
other businesses or things
I've got going on because

448
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,130
I think about it too much.

449
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:26,611
Um,

450
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:26,941
and so,

451
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:28,410
especially when it's
a controversial thing,

452
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:31,620
when people are questioning things and
it's going to piss you off even more.

453
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:31,891
I mean,

454
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:33,060
I hate losing,

455
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:34,200
so you're definitely gonna see us.

456
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,250
So at night was rough man.

457
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:37,720
I mean the ride back to
the hotel and you know,

458
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,090
I didn't want to go out.

459
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:40,230
I didn't want really want to eat.

460
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,700
I just wanted to hang out with my son,

461
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,001
you know,

462
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:46,200
like just get me away from fighting
and let me think about my family.

463
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:47,034
So,

464
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:47,970
yeah.

465
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,661
So,

466
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:49,170
um,

467
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,050
where is everything at
right now in terms of,

468
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,610
have you talked to the UFC?

469
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,290
What was their take on everything?

470
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,340
Um,

471
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,930
Dana said it was a quick stoppage.

472
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,793
Yeah.

473
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,530
I mean everyone's been
saying it's quick stop.

474
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,010
Big John McCarthy.

475
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,400
John McCarthy is calling out the raft
saying he thought it was a quick stoppage.

476
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:05,850
We got,

477
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,860
I talked to any texts on
a couple of nights ago.

478
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,013
The same thing.

479
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,421
Yeah.

480
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:09,601
I mean,

481
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:09,991
so everyone,

482
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:10,350
everyone,

483
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,790
everyone thinks it,

484
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,121
you know,

485
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:12,750
and uh,

486
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,680
Dana was saying like,

487
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:13,890
hey,

488
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,071
okay,

489
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:16,560
we'll figure it out next couple
of days or at least off of edge.

490
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:17,730
I'm obviously pissed about it.

491
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,600
Just know that nothing,

492
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:19,470
I want this to happen,

493
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:19,711
you know.

494
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:20,544
So,

495
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,911
um,

496
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:21,451
my manager,

497
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:21,871
Tiki,

498
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:22,830
he's been in talks with,

499
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:24,050
we haven't really heard nothing yet on,

500
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,470
on the decision what's going to happen.

501
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,280
I love Tiki.

502
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,991
He's the best.

503
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:27,690
He's a great guy.

504
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,060
He's,

505
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,090
he's a great manager because
he's been in the fight game.

506
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,201
He's been around,

507
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:31,501
he's fine.

508
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:32,640
He's been here forever,

509
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,260
early UFC days too.

510
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,190
Good dude too.

511
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,890
He's just got such a great personality.

512
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:38,400
He's just a fun guy to be around.

513
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:38,671
Yeah.

514
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:39,361
So He's been,

515
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:41,820
he's been awesome from a career.

516
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:42,990
I've only been with
them for a short while,

517
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,261
the time,

518
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:44,280
but he's been awesome for me.

519
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,551
But,

520
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:44,940
uh,

521
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,570
he's been in talks with a
hunter and Dana and so we're,

522
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:50,790
I'm hoping to figure out
something soon because I'm,

523
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,900
I'll fight tomorrow,

524
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,231
you know,

525
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:52,951
like I'll fight him.

526
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:53,110
He,

527
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,190
whatever way he wants,

528
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,240
obviously would prefer 20 fives because
I put it in a lot of work and I want to

529
00:11:58,241 --> 00:11:59,920
show that I know what I'm doing.

530
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:04,240
And it wasn't a fluke or did this was a
fluke that this wasn't something that,

531
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,560
um,

532
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:05,711
well,

533
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:06,400
here's the deal.

534
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,380
Even if the fight went longer,

535
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,140
any stopped you and he
legitimately stopped.

536
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,830
Yeah.

537
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,131
Look,

538
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:12,761
he's Henry.

539
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:13,830
So who don't mean that that's,

540
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,980
that's a possibility.

541
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:15,790
This is the game.

542
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,360
100%.

543
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,110
This is what it is.

544
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,160
That's why me so great.

545
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,400
Right.

546
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,330
It is what can happen.

547
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:19,991
You know what I mean?

548
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:23,230
Like you go out there like no
matter if you're the huge favorite,

549
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,130
anything can happen.

550
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,740
It just didn't get a chance to happen.

551
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,640
That's what's unfortunate.

552
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:27,791
I mean,

553
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,900
he really did land.

554
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:30,820
Some good shots are really
what's coming on strong.

555
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,500
But he came out ready.

556
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,663
He was,

557
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,420
yeah,

558
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,350
he's a bad motherfucker.

559
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,790
And so were you,

560
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,100
which is why that fight
was so interesting.

561
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,330
He had some shit to prove.

562
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,130
He was there to save
the flyweight division.

563
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,430
Yeah.

564
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:42,970
And look,

565
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,803
he did it.

566
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,231
No one,

567
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,064
I mean,

568
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,410
until I had the balls
enough to drop down in 2025,

569
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:49,330
there really wasn't any
hype on a flyweight fight.

570
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,320
Um,

571
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,280
the net that was,

572
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,050
and now there still is
and he wants to save that.

573
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:54,790
He wants talk about saving
the flyweight division.

574
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,893
Then let's do it.

575
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,141
Well,

576
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:59,830
I think he wants to go up course
and he's then he can be champ champ.

577
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,890
And I understand that when there was
no champ champ or Connor came wrong,

578
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,360
Conor really changed the
game with so many ways.

579
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:07,960
But I mean,

580
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,420
one of the ways he changed the game
was calling himself champ champ.

581
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,050
Now everybody is chat,

582
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:12,690
chat,

583
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,800
you know Ryan baders champ champ.

584
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,230
You help me.

585
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,610
No,

586
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,650
I mean Amanda Nunez is champion.

587
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:20,950
It's a way to market yourself and get
your name out there and it is a really big

588
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:21,310
deal.

589
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,410
You know I'm at the term champ champ.

590
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:23,860
Oh yeah.

591
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,780
It's like that is a
fucking Conor McGregor.

592
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,520
That's a Conor McGregor term.

593
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:28,181
He's got some,

594
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:28,630
uh,

595
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,190
he's got some gold behind his touch.

596
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,930
Anything he touches turns into gold.

597
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:32,920
I not lucky charm.

598
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,761
He's a character.

599
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:34,700
He is who he is.

600
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,920
And I understand that.

601
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:36,130
I mean,

602
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,340
I'll fight Henry scooter whatever way
he wants to fight cause I have no,

603
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,210
I can't,

604
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,110
I can't dictate where it goes because
I just said what had just happened,

605
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,510
you know,

606
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,070
it seems like the correct way to do it
would be at 25 because if you guys fought

607
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:49,000
at 35,

608
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:49,990
um,

609
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,440
it's,

610
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,801
you know,

611
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:52,540
it's a different ball
of wax and it percent,

612
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,680
I just think given the circumstances and
the fact that you did make the weight

613
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,510
fairly not easy,

614
00:13:58,511 --> 00:13:59,590
I wouldn't never say easy.

615
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,180
I would say easy.

616
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:01,421
I mean,

617
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:01,751
like I said,

618
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:02,471
it's a lot of work,

619
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:03,100
but dude,

620
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,440
I can't believe how actually easy it was.

621
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,483
Um,

622
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,160
I mean it was like going through the
graphs that Sam showed me and it was

623
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:09,790
remarkable.

624
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,750
I got stronger,

625
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,040
I was putting up more weight.

626
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,810
So the last week before I left,

627
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,471
before my fight,

628
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:18,160
I was snatching and cleaning a more
weight than my last Cody fight.

629
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,270
And I was lighter.

630
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,070
So my power ratio was insane.

631
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:22,150
It almost is unheard of,

632
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,200
but I think it's because of how strict
the had to be for those 12 weeks is maybe

633
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:29,350
why I'm like what was your diet like?

634
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:31,790
Like what do you eat in and out of key?

635
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,140
I could,

636
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,270
you can't be in Ketosis obviously
cause I trained too hard.

637
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:34,900
Right.

638
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,733
But um,

639
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,820
no grains,

640
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,390
you know,

641
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,223
if I'm eating carbs,

642
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,011
simple carbs,

643
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:39,844
things like that,

644
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,833
like fruits,

645
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,651
fruits,

646
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:42,251
vegetables,

647
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:43,061
sweet potatoes,

648
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:43,750
things like that.

649
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,010
And you're weighing everything out.

650
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,323
They do all that.

651
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,631
I,

652
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:46,950
I'm,

653
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,190
I'm not doing it personally myself.

654
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:48,740
Sam,

655
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,720
his family do it.

656
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:49,960
Um,

657
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,650
the training lab,

658
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,070
they every meal,

659
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:52,640
every snack.

660
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,780
So I meet him three meals a day.

661
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:55,490
I'm actually pretty good calories too.

662
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,960
I mean three meals a day,

663
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:58,550
two snacks a day on.

664
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:01,190
But it's also about when I stopped
beating my intermittent fasting,

665
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,220
me doing my low base warm
while I'm fasting to get my
body to be burned in 100%

666
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:07,161
fats.

667
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:08,750
And what you said doing your low base.

668
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:11,210
What do you mean by my like long distance.

669
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,620
So low cardio,

670
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,060
slow movements along.

671
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,953
So it's not hard.

672
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,900
It's something I want to keep my heart
rate at a certain variable depending on

673
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:19,010
what my vo two Max is,

674
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:20,120
what my Rmr is.

675
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,410
There's this crossover where your body
starts burning carbs or starts burning

676
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,170
fats.

677
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,400
If you're sprinting,

678
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:27,020
you're going hard and hard and hard.

679
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,170
Your body is going to start burning
carbs cause it needs to burn carbs to go

680
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:31,004
that hard.

681
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,710
But when you're at a certain
level like so for instance,

682
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:34,491
when I started camp,

683
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:39,491
my crossover was at one 45 so I need
to keep my heart rate under one 45 for

684
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,300
maybe four to five minutes.

685
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,631
There may be,

686
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:42,464
now I'm getting closer.

687
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,270
I need to lose more weight
and need to go an hour.

688
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,040
So one 45 is a,

689
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,660
is that 80% no,

690
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:50,550
70% of your heart rate must be a,

691
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,351
everyone's different.

692
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,520
It depends on your vo two is,

693
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,181
um,

694
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:56,990
I don't remember what mine was exactly
what percentage wise at one 45 is a sweet

695
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:59,390
spot where you're burning
fat at the beginning of camp.

696
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,290
But towards the end of the camp,

697
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:04,220
I can go to like one 55
because I got in better shape.

698
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,090
Um,

699
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,420
my,

700
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,253
my,

701
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,090
I,

702
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,880
I was just in better shape as a better
machine that where I could go harder and

703
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:13,010
still be in a fat burning substrate.

704
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,130
And then he would dictate if I need
you to do 40 minutes in a minute,

705
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:17,300
maybe an hour at night,

706
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,320
and depending on how we wanted my body
to react and then he's also spiking and

707
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:22,940
take away my insulin levels to get my,

708
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,700
because I don't want to be
in Ketosis always right?

709
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,750
Cause my body will crash,

710
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,280
but I need to be in it to get my body
weight down without losing weight

711
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:31,791
unhealthy.

712
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,160
If I would have waited to the
last two weeks of crash my weight,

713
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,900
I would have been dehydrated.

714
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,030
But all the way up until wanes,

715
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,590
my body was over 60,

716
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,030
60% hydrated.

717
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,370
Most of the camp I was 66% hydrated.

718
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,000
Um,

719
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,490
and that's because you don't only get
hydrated from the water you drink,

720
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:49,790
you're hydrated from the supplements
you're going to take and the foods you're

721
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,710
taking in inside yourselves.

722
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,020
So when you say you're
getting into Ketosis,

723
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:58,180
are you doing it 100% through diet or
you take an exhaustion is ketones or

724
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,180
you're doing anything else?

725
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,160
Just Diet and the way I work out diet,

726
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:04,900
the way you work out and then the
intermittent fasting is a 16 hour window.

727
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,660
You using?

728
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,500
We switch it up.

729
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,180
Um,

730
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,600
when I was getting closer to fight.

731
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:09,380
Yeah.

732
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,920
Um,

733
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,180
but when I was further out maybe like,

734
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:11,930
you know,

735
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,130
14 hours,

736
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:14,000
things like that and I wasn't,

737
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,750
I didn't,

738
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,610
I didn't have to intermittent
fast the whole camp,

739
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,181
you know,

740
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:20,630
just after a certain point I need to get
my buddy Wayne even lower than it was

741
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:21,800
that there's this,

742
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,160
this trend that we were following to
continue to get my body weight down.

743
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:25,994
And he would,

744
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,780
um,

745
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,360
implement certain things to,

746
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:30,140
to force it that direction.

747
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,100
Well,

748
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,521
it's just,

749
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:32,750
I've never seen,

750
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,021
I mean,

751
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:38,021
I know some pretty well
documented training routines
and diet routines and some

752
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,720
guys have really gotten into
the weeds with this stuff,

753
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:44,500
but I don't think I've
ever seen it like you man.

754
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,290
Um,

755
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,900
I was always into training
and doing everything as,

756
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,130
as well as I can and,

757
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,100
and find every

758
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,930
angle I could possibly be
to be the best athlete.

759
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:53,040
That's my competitive edge.

760
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:53,700
Um,

761
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,630
and then when I met Sam,

762
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:58,620
I knew that was my next level and I
didn't realize that it had low test.

763
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,610
And before I met Sam,

764
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,880
until he tested my levels and did
my hair analysis and all that stuff,

765
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,590
I didn't realize what was
going on with my body.

766
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:06,840
I just trained hard and I
thought I was training smart.

767
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,261
Then I met Sam.

768
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:09,660
It took it to a whole nother level.

769
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:10,470
Well,

770
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,550
the training hard,

771
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:15,300
sometimes the problem is your body just
never really gets a chance to catch up.

772
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,830
They're really gets a chance to recover.

773
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:21,240
And there's a lot of really good fighters
that are doing that to themselves

774
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:22,074
because they're just,

775
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,621
you know,

776
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:23,610
especially wrestlers,

777
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,460
they have that mentality
just to just fucking go.

778
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:27,720
They don't care if they're miserable,

779
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:28,650
they're mentally tough,

780
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:29,550
they keep pushing,

781
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,130
and your body just is always
behind the eight ball.

782
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,630
You never really get a chance to recover.

783
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,920
I was red line in my body.

784
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,480
Yeah,

785
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:35,760
I was,

786
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,330
I was not eating right and I was
working out as hard as I possibly could,

787
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,920
pound in the caffeine,

788
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:41,850
uh,

789
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,230
and my body was just telling me,

790
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:43,640
no,

791
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,190
you know,

792
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,370
my,

793
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,380
my top men's testosterone
was crashed and like,

794
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,600
to see where it's at now is amazing.

795
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:48,781
You know,

796
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:50,130
what did he do to boost it back up?

797
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,323
My Diet,

798
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,350
my segmentation,

799
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,780
which all my supplements are
food based for the most part.

800
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:55,021
I mean,

801
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:55,860
there'll be supplements,

802
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:58,480
but they're Aminos in all
whole food banks days,

803
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,880
magnesium,

804
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,530
Zincs,

805
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,470
a trip to fans.

806
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:03,870
And one of the things
glycine is tyrosines oh,

807
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,763
Krill oil.

808
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,290
Know all different ways in
different times of taking,

809
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,460
depending on what I'm doing,

810
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,170
I'm the certain kind of create teams.

811
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:10,651
I'm taking,

812
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,760
my proteins are all,

813
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:12,480
uh,

814
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,320
organic.

815
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,621
Um,

816
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:14,300
he's uh,

817
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,630
this company or gain that's,

818
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:15,761
I,

819
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:16,860
I take a lot of their stuff,

820
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:17,041
you know,

821
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:17,760
there,

822
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,080
there,

823
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,070
there everything's tested or organic.

824
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,580
Um,

825
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,530
so everything I'm doing is all whole,

826
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,150
whole food based supplements.

827
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,460
And then the way I'm training as well too,

828
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:26,880
like,

829
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,550
so he's listened to my heart
rate variability when I sleep.

830
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,300
What do you,

831
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,290
what are you wearing to,

832
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,020
uh,

833
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,490
wear a heart rate monitor made by Suunto.

834
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,510
Okay.

835
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,343
But yeah,

836
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,640
it's not so much the heart
and monitor that does it.

837
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:40,050
It's his algorithm that does it.

838
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:41,490
So every morning I wake up,

839
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,080
my phone's connected to my watch.

840
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:43,914
I say my,

841
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,240
my heart rate on a phone,

842
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,591
a phone,

843
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:47,850
just a apple phone.

844
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,030
But it's just the APP is
a first be I think it is.

845
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,810
But your watch,

846
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,643
it's connected to your,

847
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,700
do you have a swatch watch and
it connects traverse Alphas?

848
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,280
Is that what it is?

849
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,580
Yeah,

850
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,550
mine's a,

851
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:58,980
yeah,

852
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,761
something like that.

853
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:02,370
But it connects to your phone
through Bluetooth and then,

854
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,910
um,

855
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,070
and so you're wearing the
monitor with the watch.

856
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,530
The watch is just on the nightstand,

857
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:06,770
right.

858
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,810
I sleep with the Monitor on and it
will track me all the to my sleep.

859
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,040
I mean you may only want like,

860
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,610
you know when you get into that rem
sleep and it's like three hours and it'll

861
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,171
automatically,

862
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:15,571
I wake up,

863
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:17,250
I sync it to my phone,

864
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,580
it sends it to his program and then he's
got an algorithm and to tell me like

865
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,530
what percentage recovery I am,

866
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:22,801
you know,

867
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:26,430
cause this is his own proprietary
program that he's developed himself.

868
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:26,880
Yeah.

869
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,140
Jesus is for us taking him.

870
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,240
I mean do this guy is a genius man.

871
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,560
I'm telling you like me hanging out
with him for two years and I'm finally

872
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:35,730
getting it all somewhat down.

873
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:35,941
You know,

874
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:37,110
I've learned so much from it.

875
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,260
I mean I've learned more from him in the
last two years than I've ever learned

876
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:40,621
to school.

877
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:41,820
And I was a kinesiology major.

878
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,320
I was cleaning clinical exercise science.

879
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:44,850
I was going to be a physician's assistant.

880
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,170
I was always into the body,

881
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,010
but just going and working out with him

882
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,621
and his garage,

883
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:49,454
his little tiny,

884
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:50,381
you know,

885
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:54,500
garage that it looks like you'd never
think world champions train there every,

886
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:54,911
you know,

887
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,230
like the,

888
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:55,900
and p goes,

889
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,370
the one arch Liletta is myself,

890
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:57,851
cub,

891
00:20:57,851 --> 00:20:58,511
Swanson,

892
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:01,330
like all these bad guys go in and train
and there's just some little garage.

893
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:04,510
But I've learned more from him in that
garage than I've ever learned through any

894
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:07,060
of my schools and become wanting
to become a physician's assistant.

895
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,141
That's crazy.

896
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:08,710
Yeah.

897
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,530
Um,

898
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,010
what did you think of the Pico fight?

899
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:11,951
Oh man,

900
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:12,910
it's so unfortunate.

901
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,710
Crazier.

902
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,380
He's just,

903
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,670
he's such a killer that he
wants to knock everyone out.

904
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,560
Not only does he want to be
the best fighter in the world,

905
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,480
but he wants to be the most
entertaining fighters in the world.

906
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,780
So he's looking to punish you because
he's got so many weapons that he doesn't

907
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:26,560
use.

908
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,400
He's so good,

909
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:27,980
man.

910
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,750
Um,

911
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,510
but he lives by the sword and he
dies by the sword kind of thing.

912
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:31,691
You know,

913
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:32,680
he wants to be that,

914
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,750
that knock you out entertaining fight or
he wants to be able to show a highlight

915
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:39,550
reel first round knockouts,

916
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:39,970
you know,

917
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,270
um,

918
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,290
which is great.

919
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:41,770
Yeah.

920
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:46,420
But you always have to understand that
you are just like the guy right in front

921
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:48,100
of you and that one shot,

922
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,270
especially in MMA,

923
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:51,160
one shot can turn it all around.

924
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:51,994
And it did.

925
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,360
It was one of the most shocking knock
out something I've ever seen because it

926
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:57,250
looked like he looked fucking phenomenal.

927
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,950
He came out there and we knew that he
had been trading with you for this fight

928
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,300
who was fucking shredded.

929
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,590
He looked like a world beater,

930
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,070
you know,

931
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,430
went out their land in that clean up
or caught and then God just way carried

932
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:06,810
away.

933
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,450
Yup.

934
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,810
And it's unfortunate because you think
I'm in shape and I do crazy things.

935
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:14,290
This guy is putting me to
shame like Sam's garage,

936
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,740
but he's able to do on the bike and just
as workout regimen and like just how

937
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:18,880
competitive he is.

938
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:19,691
Man.

939
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:20,171
He's a,

940
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:20,921
he's a world beater.

941
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:22,720
He could be by far will champion.

942
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:22,991
You know,

943
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:24,420
there's some things that he's in,

944
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,151
he's so young,

945
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:27,100
so there's some things we
need to get to figure out.

946
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:28,650
Everyone takes losses and uh,

947
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,261
help them.

948
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:32,650
One of these is going to just spark him
to realize how good he is everywhere,

949
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,041
you know?

950
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:33,874
And uh,

951
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,550
yeah.

952
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,830
It's just an unfortunate situation.

953
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:36,640
MMA.

954
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,131
Yeah.

955
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:41,350
I mean guys have bounced back from
knockouts and become world champions

956
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:42,070
unquestionably.

957
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,371
It's just,

958
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:44,230
he's got to make sure he
doesn't have too many of those,

959
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,771
you know,

960
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:44,871
and,

961
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:46,330
and make sure we fight smart.

962
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,313
Agreed uses,

963
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,300
use that goddamn wrestling too.

964
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,081
It's insane risks.

965
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:50,321
I mean,

966
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:53,440
he's so good as a wrestler and
when he gets that guy hurt,

967
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,360
he's collar tie there.

968
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:58,090
They're grabbing each other by
the neck and just swinging shots.

969
00:22:58,091 --> 00:22:58,480
You're,

970
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,130
you're flipping a coin and
you're rolling the dice.

971
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,960
He got six fights or something like that.

972
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,230
Yeah.

973
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,660
I mean it's one of those
inexperience things and he's only 22.

974
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:04,990
Yeah.

975
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,010
I mean that's the other thing.

976
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,250
And you realize like when he dropped him,

977
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:09,100
he could have jumped on him.

978
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:10,780
He could have swarmed
him like Henry did to me.

979
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,081
You know,

980
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:13,690
like jump on him and swarm
them and look for that finish.

981
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:15,070
But um,

982
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,850
I think the inexperience kind of makes
him realize like they may be he's

983
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:20,170
invincible and just,

984
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:21,791
I don't know man.

985
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:21,971
There's,

986
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:24,000
there's things that you kind of figure
out when you've been out in the cage

987
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,460
longer and longer and you've
been around the creek,

988
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:27,670
you understand there's
ways to finish a fight or,

989
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,541
or how to,

990
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:32,260
how to just be a smart fighter that
he'll figure out what was the whole

991
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:35,350
experience like being on this
ESPN card because it's a,

992
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:36,610
that was a historic moment,

993
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:37,360
much like,

994
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,820
like the Cain Velasquez
vs junior dos Santos,

995
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:43,930
which also stopped the same way
and that was that controversial.

996
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,440
That was not comfortable punch though.

997
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,360
The Punch that landed
was also behind the ear.

998
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,231
Same Punch.

999
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:48,501
You know,

1000
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,300
like it's one of those things that you,

1001
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,640
it just takes your feet out from,

1002
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,900
if you've ever fought or
if you've ever been in,

1003
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,340
got hit in the back of the head,

1004
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,090
weird.

1005
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,440
Your feet go out from underneath you,

1006
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:58,274
but you're there,

1007
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,080
you're a hundred percent
aware of what's going on.

1008
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:01,160
But your balance isn't there,

1009
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:02,780
then you have another
grown man on top of you.

1010
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:03,021
You know,

1011
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:04,820
so of course things are gonna happen.

1012
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:05,331
But uh,

1013
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:06,860
with the ESPN it was really cool.

1014
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,150
The whole lead up to it.

1015
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:08,630
They film,

1016
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,530
they came to film my late,

1017
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,820
they were around a lot.

1018
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,410
They did a lot of exposure.

1019
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:12,951
They,

1020
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,490
um,

1021
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,080
the stuff they put out was really cool.

1022
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:19,130
And then just seeing like our commercial
for a fight on national football,

1023
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:21,090
on ESPN or for the call it,

1024
00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:21,290
you know,

1025
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,650
because college was going on and then
you'd see the nationals is going on and

1026
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:27,500
you'd see me in re like three
different commercials and ESPN.

1027
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,333
I thought that was pretty cool.

1028
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:28,851
No,

1029
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:29,684
it was amazing.

1030
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,021
You know,

1031
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:30,231
I mean,

1032
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:31,064
it really,

1033
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,150
it's cool to see,

1034
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,200
it's cool to see that ESPN is embracing
the sport and then it's getting into it.

1035
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:36,981
And you know,

1036
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:38,900
there was a lot of hype
behind this and you know,

1037
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:40,520
I got ESPN plus I wasn't,

1038
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,080
yeah,

1039
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,470
no.

1040
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,860
I mean I'm not a sports fan.

1041
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,760
I don't watch sport.

1042
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:44,990
I don't even know what's happening.

1043
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:45,560
Like what people like,

1044
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,480
what are you doing for the Superbowl?

1045
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:46,761
I'm like,

1046
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:47,390
when's that?

1047
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,440
That's exactly what I did.

1048
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,510
I don't have time for it,

1049
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:50,890
man.

1050
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,460
Um,

1051
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,070
I'm a,

1052
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,940
I'm a Raiders fan,

1053
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,620
but I don't have time to really watch,

1054
00:24:54,621 --> 00:24:54,891
you know.

1055
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:55,390
Right.

1056
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,223
Um,

1057
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:56,961
but yeah,

1058
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:57,770
I mean it's just,

1059
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,700
when you think of sports,

1060
00:24:58,701 --> 00:24:59,501
you think ESPN.

1061
00:24:59,501 --> 00:24:59,631
Yeah.

1062
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:00,171
You really do.

1063
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:00,351
I mean,

1064
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:03,530
it's another level of
acceptance in the sports world.

1065
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,350
The only thing that kind of bumped me out,

1066
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:09,680
and I should probably clarify this because
I talked about this on the podcast,

1067
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,730
was the hardy fight.

1068
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,983
And not,

1069
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,400
not even because I don't think the guy
should be fighting or not even because I

1070
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:17,200
think I,

1071
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,330
I,

1072
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:17,601
you know,

1073
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:18,140
I don't,

1074
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,260
I don't really know what he
did in terms of his past.

1075
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,510
I know there's a lot of,

1076
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,460
there's a lot of shit,

1077
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:25,940
right?

1078
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,151
I mean,

1079
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,040
he was in trouble for something.

1080
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:30,350
There was an appeal and
he got off of it somehow.

1081
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,543
I don't know,

1082
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,330
but I'm only talking about it
from a fighting perspective.

1083
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,870
You're watching the highest level fights.

1084
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,520
You're watching the co main event.

1085
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,100
He's just not ready for a co main event.

1086
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,360
Like technically no,

1087
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,110
no way.

1088
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,380
Yeah.

1089
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,760
Just see what he rushed out.

1090
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:47,630
He gassed out,

1091
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,520
he burned himself out,

1092
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,980
Crowder recovered and it just,

1093
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:57,310
it's not the way it should
be is you should have the
early fights are people who

1094
00:25:58,491 --> 00:25:59,540
are learning the sport.

1095
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,210
And then when you get to
the last couple of fights,

1096
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:02,751
the cove,

1097
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:03,890
Maine and the main,

1098
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,520
you're supposed to be seeing
assassins like you and Henry.

1099
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:08,300
So Huda,

1100
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,590
that's what you're supposed to be seeing.

1101
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,573
And it just,

1102
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:10,910
yeah.

1103
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,990
Crazy thing about our sport is,

1104
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,730
is a lot of entertainment
behind it as well too.

1105
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:15,050
So if you're hyped up,

1106
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:16,160
you get pushed up the ladder,

1107
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:17,900
maybe you get title fight
sooner than you should.

1108
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:21,290
And that's crazy because
now we're on ESPN,

1109
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:21,920
now we're like,

1110
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,753
we're an official,

1111
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,170
I mean we've been an official sport,

1112
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:24,651
but yeah,

1113
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:27,950
it should be more on the level like
you're talking about of the actual skill

1114
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:29,090
level and how you're ranked.

1115
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:29,630
I mean,

1116
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,040
cowboy Serone and the Alex kid should
have been the a hundred percent main

1117
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:34,430
event.

1118
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,680
100% I was stunned that it wasn't.

1119
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,660
They imagine they were on real,

1120
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:39,850
they were on ESPN though.

1121
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:41,870
They wanted to kind of hype up and plus,

1122
00:26:41,871 --> 00:26:42,260
you know,

1123
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:42,980
sense.

1124
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,130
That makes sense for that

1125
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,491
reason.

1126
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:44,850
Yeah.

1127
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,430
But there's another fight they
could have put in place of that.

1128
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,320
I mean there's 100% and the it,

1129
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:49,531
Ken,

1130
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:51,420
this is not a knock on Crowder or hardy.

1131
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:52,710
There are guys out there doing it.

1132
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,131
They're,

1133
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:53,970
they're trying,

1134
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,721
they did their job.

1135
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:55,560
They did their job.

1136
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,423
They're fighting.

1137
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,190
The ending was super unfortunate.

1138
00:26:59,210 --> 00:26:59,580
Yeah.

1139
00:26:59,580 --> 00:26:59,971
Again,

1140
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:01,980
you don't know whether or
not he did it on purpose,

1141
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:03,020
whether he had a mental,

1142
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,240
you're getting punched in the face
and that stuff happens so fast.

1143
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:07,070
Chaos.

1144
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,760
I mean especially because he is so new,

1145
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:08,971
right?

1146
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:09,480
Yes.

1147
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,970
He hasn't been fighting forever.

1148
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,330
Like that stuff just happens.

1149
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:12,480
Like,

1150
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:12,601
oh,

1151
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:13,434
I got them hurt,

1152
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,870
you know,

1153
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,850
don't like,

1154
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:16,300
there's things like I've
even done in practices.

1155
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,191
Oh Shit Dude,

1156
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:17,441
I'm so,

1157
00:27:17,441 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm in practice and I did something.

1158
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:18,930
I'm like,

1159
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,381
Oh man,

1160
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:20,101
that was stupid.

1161
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:21,150
Like it happens in a fight.

1162
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,260
I'm losing a point.

1163
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,100
Like I'm so sorry.

1164
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,401
You know,

1165
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:27,630
like it's just bums me out that
this rush to commercialization,

1166
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:27,961
that this,

1167
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:32,160
this rush to trying to
get the most eyes on it.

1168
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,020
The people that are watching it.

1169
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,230
If you watch something where there's
two guys who really aren't ready for Co

1170
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:38,064
main event,

1171
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,810
but you're seeing sloppiness and guys
getting out of gas real quick and you see

1172
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,380
all the things that you're supposed to
learn early in your career so that by the

1173
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,270
time you get to a co main event,

1174
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,340
you know you're a fucking assassin,

1175
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:50,761
you're,

1176
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:53,910
you're locked down and a
hundred percent professional.

1177
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,070
You're a real elite pro fighter.

1178
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,670
That's what I want to see
when I'm watching ESPN.

1179
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah,

1180
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,960
that's what I want to see you.

1181
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,850
I want to see the best of the best.

1182
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:03,240
You know,

1183
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,240
I want to see world class
fighters fighting with
precision and power and speed

1184
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:12,780
and knowing how to pace themselves guys
or the experience they've been there

1185
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:13,020
before.

1186
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,400
They know how to recover from things.

1187
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,181
They get cracked.

1188
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:16,260
They know how to lay back.

1189
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,280
They know how to hold on.

1190
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,330
They know how to do what they need to
do in order to win or fight their best

1191
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,550
instead of like just like you're seeing
things and so many people are seeing

1192
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:29,940
this at this point and I feel like
we're getting fans and all that are more

1193
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,710
knowledgeable like yourself and,

1194
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:31,940
and,

1195
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,880
and people are seeing this
sport and understanding
technique now to where before

1196
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:36,750
maybe it didn't matter,

1197
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,550
you didn't know what bad technique is now,

1198
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:38,761
you know,

1199
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:41,670
but we get more knowledgeable fans to
where they are going to start realizing

1200
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:41,721
it.

1201
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:42,620
Like what was that like?

1202
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,280
Right.

1203
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,870
The last thing you want to see
is two heavyweights gassed out.

1204
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,470
Yes.

1205
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,270
That is the fucking worst.

1206
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,133
Yeah.

1207
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,100
Do you remember when,

1208
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:50,670
um,

1209
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,800
what was it Ben Rothwell?

1210
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,060
Was it Mark Hunt?

1211
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,990
I think it was Ben Roswell
and Mark Hunt fought in,

1212
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,320
I want to say it so it's two
guys when it might be wrong.

1213
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,680
See if that's in Denver.

1214
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,900
They made him fight at altitude.

1215
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,920
I remember the fight in Denver.

1216
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:05,820
I don't know if it was them either,

1217
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:06,121
but yeah,

1218
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:08,000
it was fucking ridiculous.

1219
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:13,001
Cause they're there at altitude and
there's so goddamn tired and like fucking,

1220
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,401
and the UFC is like,

1221
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:17,160
we're never going to do a heavyweight
fight again ever at altitude.

1222
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,670
It wasn't,

1223
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:17,821
yeah,

1224
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:19,170
it was been Rothbaum Mark Hunt,

1225
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,470
but then they wound up
doing Cain Velasquez and um,

1226
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,360
uh,

1227
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,430
are there very doom for
IBC where Mexico City,

1228
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,761
which is even higher,

1229
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:28,680
it's 2000 feet above Denver.

1230
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:29,410
Dune was smart,

1231
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,243
went up there early,

1232
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,060
we looked like a killer out there,

1233
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,690
you know.

1234
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,370
Um,

1235
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:33,620
and,

1236
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:33,890
and,

1237
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,540
and I think from what
I remember that came,

1238
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,400
went out there two weeks before the fight,

1239
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,050
which actually makes it worse for you.

1240
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,130
It'd be better off if you went
up there three days before

1241
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,631
the fight,

1242
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:43,870
cause your body still in shock,

1243
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,231
right?

1244
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:46,990
Rather than going up there in two
weeks and now your body's screwed.

1245
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,560
You know,

1246
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,281
you need to be there.

1247
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:49,120
If you're going to be there early,

1248
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,800
go six weeks or more,

1249
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:51,611
don't,

1250
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:52,450
don't go less.

1251
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:54,790
If you're gonna go less come through a
couple of days because your body is still

1252
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:58,810
in shock and you see how a fight like
that can literally change the course of a

1253
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,670
fighter's career.

1254
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,280
Yes.

1255
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,590
I mean it changed Keynes
career in many ways.

1256
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:02,951
You know,

1257
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:03,371
one,

1258
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:05,950
one loss like that to a
guy like Fabricio over.

1259
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:07,360
Do you know,

1260
00:30:07,361 --> 00:30:07,660
um,

1261
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,950
he's fighting real,

1262
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:09,511
real soon.

1263
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:10,240
Side freelance,

1264
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,510
right?

1265
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,720
Francis and Ghana help.

1266
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,663
He's healthy.

1267
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,750
He has to.

1268
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,530
I hope so.

1269
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,200
God dammit.

1270
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,400
Yeah.

1271
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,270
I mean if he's not,

1272
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,890
he's in trouble cause man,

1273
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:18,940
he could be the best heavyweight.

1274
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,330
I mean,

1275
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,770
I think he was the best heavyweight,

1276
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:23,860
just unfortunate situations where
he didn't get to to prove that.

1277
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,693
I mean he's one of the,

1278
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,650
well I think his thing was that his
body just couldn't deal with his mind.

1279
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,350
Like his mind is so strong and his,

1280
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:37,351
his will and his work ethic is so powerful
and that Goddamn camp of killers off

1281
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:43,381
the true San Jose Aka is just a Sasson
central and just the years of wrestling.

1282
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:44,691
Yeah,

1283
00:30:44,691 --> 00:30:45,640
I mean wrestling.

1284
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:45,970
Yup.

1285
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,410
Hurt me more than anything.

1286
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:47,920
Really.

1287
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,450
Anything for that I still do today.

1288
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,460
Even if I get hurt today.

1289
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:52,810
It's from wrestling practice.

1290
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,850
It's wrestling is the
hardest thing on my body.

1291
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:55,900
Um,

1292
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,561
your neck,

1293
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:57,221
your back,

1294
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:58,180
your shoulders,

1295
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:58,720
it,

1296
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:58,980
it,

1297
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,813
I mean it's,

1298
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,600
it's rough,

1299
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:00,950
you know,

1300
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,260
same Kalvia son right now.

1301
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,230
[inaudible] he's been on the couch for
the last four months and it was from

1302
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:05,750
wrestling here.

1303
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:10,030
His back eat a bulging disc
in his back or her knee disc.

1304
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,690
I'm from wrestling and he's 16
years old and she was just curls.

1305
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,740
That's a rough one.

1306
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:16,120
When you're that young
and you hurt your back.

1307
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:16,954
Yeah man.

1308
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,800
Wow.

1309
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:17,951
Yeah.

1310
00:31:17,951 --> 00:31:18,311
So it's,

1311
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:19,240
it's a part of his back.

1312
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:19,810
It's lower.

1313
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:19,991
Yeah.

1314
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:20,471
Lower back.

1315
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:20,800
Yeah.

1316
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,970
What's he got them doing for it?

1317
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,570
I would always assume a guy like that
and was exactly what to do to try to heal

1318
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:25,901
something like,

1319
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:26,101
yeah.

1320
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:26,910
So He's been doing,

1321
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,020
oh,

1322
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,800
so we've been a,

1323
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,380
he's had to,

1324
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:28,660
we,

1325
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,830
they tried doing everything naturally,

1326
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:31,750
but he's had to go and get
a couple of epidurals now.

1327
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,290
Um,

1328
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,850
the kind of the shrink to swelling.

1329
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:34,750
So the um,

1330
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,711
uh,

1331
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:36,490
obviously it's not,

1332
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,610
so it's pushing on a nerve and so it's
messing with the static nerve and it's

1333
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:40,391
hard for him to walk.

1334
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:42,430
He was having a crawl
around the house like a dog.

1335
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:45,310
Like she's laid on the couch forever
and now he's starting to walk.

1336
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:45,791
Um,

1337
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,340
but Sandy's got 'em out in the garage
doing pull ups cause that's the only thing

1338
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,920
he can do because it's a decompression,

1339
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,161
you know,

1340
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,600
he's like well hold onto the bar at least
and and get some pull ups in and start

1341
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,660
to strengthen his back so that it holds
his spine kind of where it needs to be.

1342
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,970
Cause when he's losing insane
amounts of muscle mass.

1343
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:03,460
I mean this kid was 16
years old looking good,

1344
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:05,740
working out with his dad in
the garage and then gets hurt.

1345
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:07,690
Now it looks like a different person.

1346
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,970
I feel bad for him
being a 16 year old kid,

1347
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:10,450
you know.

1348
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:10,830
Well I,

1349
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,250
I definitely feel bad that it looks bad,

1350
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:16,450
but I really feel bad that he's
got that kind of an injury at 16.

1351
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:16,631
Yeah,

1352
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:17,380
that's a,

1353
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:17,981
that's an injury.

1354
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:19,990
See which guys in their
twenties and thirties,

1355
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:20,440
and you,

1356
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,273
you know,

1357
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:24,220
you realize it's a
lifetime of beating on it.

1358
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:25,270
That when you get to that,

1359
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:25,961
when you're 16,

1360
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:26,790
that's not good.

1361
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,180
I dealt with it in my neck,

1362
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,050
um,

1363
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:32,260
and college and then also early in my
fighting career and it messes with you.

1364
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,340
I had to get a epidural shot in my
neck throughout the front bulging disk.

1365
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:36,641
Uh,

1366
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:36,881
yeah,

1367
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:39,590
it was pushing on a nerve and I
lost like 70% of the in my left.

1368
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:40,010
The harm

1369
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,140
it,

1370
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,550
you know,

1371
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,383
it's rough man.

1372
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:41,721
Yeah.

1373
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:42,500
I was on my way,

1374
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,370
the exact same thing.

1375
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:45,890
I was getting numbness in the
hands and the ulnar nerve,

1376
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:49,130
which goes from like your pinky down
through your elbows getting pain in my

1377
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:49,964
elbow.

1378
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,600
But I got real lucky that
I found a good doctor,

1379
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,590
got some spinal decompression
and Regena keen.

1380
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,230
Oh.

1381
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,360
And really fixed it up me.

1382
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Yeah.

1383
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,050
It's that blood spinning procedure
that heat up your blood and then they,

1384
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:03,460
um,

1385
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:03,620
they,

1386
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,000
they run it through a centrifuge and
they pull this yellow serum out of it.

1387
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,630
There was a week.

1388
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,770
Is that your plasma right?

1389
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,190
Yeah,

1390
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,930
we detailed it what it is.

1391
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:15,890
We showed a thing from the website
that shows the stuff they add to it,

1392
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:20,870
but it was pretty remarkable and a lot
of people with back injuries are finding

1393
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:21,470
real,

1394
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,980
real powerful relief for that because
not only does it reduce the inflammation

1395
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:26,840
but it actually really
speeds up your healing.

1396
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:27,890
Um,

1397
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,910
but for me,

1398
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:29,360
um,

1399
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,940
the spinal decompression was
like one of the best things ever.

1400
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:35,210
It's just that harness that you strap
on your neck and hang from the door.

1401
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,520
I have fucking things amaze that click,

1402
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:37,731
click,

1403
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:38,420
click done.

1404
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,820
That one I have the one that it's,

1405
00:33:39,821 --> 00:33:41,070
it's not as nice as that one.

1406
00:33:41,071 --> 00:33:42,620
My music where it like you pump it up,

1407
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:42,870
it's like,

1408
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,580
well that'll go into neckbrace.

1409
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,220
You put it on like hardly does anything
and then you pump it up with air,

1410
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,400
stretches your neck out,

1411
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,350
try to get taller.

1412
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,110
Well you definitely get
shorter as you get older.

1413
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:54,560
That's true.

1414
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,580
And that's what it is.

1415
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:55,851
I mean,

1416
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:57,200
Eddie Bravo gained an inch.

1417
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:57,771
He's a,

1418
00:33:57,771 --> 00:33:58,371
he's five,

1419
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,200
nine now because he had a disc replaced.

1420
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,950
Oh Wow.

1421
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,490
Yeah.

1422
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:01,731
Well,

1423
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:06,350
all the years of Jujitsu and weightlifting
and wrestling and everything is

1424
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:07,430
getting squashed.

1425
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:09,170
Him folding himself in half all the time,

1426
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,970
all his lower back was destroyed,

1427
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,050
destroyed.

1428
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,740
And also he's not the guy to
guy who balances everything out.

1429
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,680
Like he just Kinda does it and smokes
weed because he eats a burrito.

1430
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:20,720
Tell.

1431
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,021
Yeah.

1432
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:23,970
So his lower back was just fuck the army,

1433
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,880
but it was essentially bone on bone
and we're just constant state of

1434
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:29,391
inflammation.

1435
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:30,230
He was always in pain.

1436
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,700
Like he'd be standing up,

1437
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:32,870
like if we were somewhere,

1438
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,210
like say if we went to a bar and it had
a couple of drinks or something like

1439
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:35,540
that,

1440
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,410
he'd be standing up.

1441
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:38,180
He'd be in pain just
standing for too long.

1442
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,290
And there's a worldclass Jujitsu practice.

1443
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,270
Yeah.

1444
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,820
So he got his disc replaced
and gained an inch.

1445
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,260
They put a,

1446
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:45,560
well,

1447
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,550
I mean he had nothing.

1448
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,010
And then all of sudden
he's got an inch of disc.

1449
00:34:48,011 --> 00:34:48,560
Wow.

1450
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,760
And it's a titanium,

1451
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,100
uh,

1452
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,440
articulating disk.

1453
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,120
So it actually moves around.

1454
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:54,140
It's not fused.

1455
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:54,380
Okay.

1456
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,520
So it's in the old days,

1457
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:56,354
they would take your,

1458
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,540
your to you,

1459
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:57,981
these,

1460
00:34:57,981 --> 00:34:58,251
you know,

1461
00:34:58,251 --> 00:35:01,190
the vertebrae and lock them
together and screw them in place.

1462
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:05,810
And it's a nightmare because it puts an
artificial load on the upper disc above

1463
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:08,780
it and the lower disc is now
there's this unusual leverage there,

1464
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,040
but instead of that,

1465
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,470
now they use a desk and actual disc,

1466
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:17,300
they put it in place and it lasts a long
ass fucking time and it moves around

1467
00:35:17,301 --> 00:35:18,980
like you and he doesn't
have any pain anymore.

1468
00:35:18,981 --> 00:35:21,800
And guys are back to Roland and I know a,

1469
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:22,041
you know,

1470
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:22,850
some real,

1471
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,490
Chris Weidman actually just got
a disc replaced in his neck.

1472
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,550
I saw that as well now.

1473
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,000
But Caina his fused.

1474
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:29,211
Right.

1475
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,190
Cause he had back problems
and his was his fused.

1476
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,080
He's got a bunch of
shit going on his back.

1477
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,940
He's had multiple back surgeries.

1478
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,880
I don't know the exact extent of all
the different surgeries that he got,

1479
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:41,430
but he's definitely got a lot
of stuff going on in his bag.

1480
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,280
Yeah.

1481
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,611
Interesting.

1482
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:44,260
You seem a bit,

1483
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,510
becomes back healthy and looks good.

1484
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,380
Look man.

1485
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:46,800
Um,

1486
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,000
a skill for skill,

1487
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,260
ability for ability.

1488
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:50,250
I think he,

1489
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:51,690
if he's not the best of all time,

1490
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,560
it's him and Fader,

1491
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,011
you know,

1492
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:56,660
and then you always have to
mention Verdomme cause even
though Steve Bay knocked

1493
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,211
for do mountain,

1494
00:35:57,211 --> 00:35:59,040
the first round for doom is submitted,

1495
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,330
the best of the best submitted Minataro
he submitted fade or he submitted Kaine.

1496
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,890
I mean what the fuck?

1497
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,570
I mean that that guy,

1498
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:09,610
is it just for doing
it for dooms record it,

1499
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,100
if you just look at who he's fine,

1500
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:11,640
he's fine.

1501
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,330
He's the best.

1502
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:12,780
Yeah.

1503
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,650
I in my opinion,

1504
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:14,880
and for how long he's been around,

1505
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,780
but it's like,

1506
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,150
but when did he beat those guys?

1507
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,290
Like when did he beat those guys?

1508
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:19,830
Did he beat those?

1509
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:24,830
Like when you beat fade or fade or was
as close to his prime as you can get

1510
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:26,610
when,

1511
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:26,911
you know,

1512
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:27,700
like it's hard to say.

1513
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,830
Like the Brett Rogers fight,

1514
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:32,090
a lot of people were saying he wasn't
as focused for the Brett Rogers Swipe,

1515
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,570
but he's still knocked
him out with one punch.

1516
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,520
Remember that crazy fucking chaos.

1517
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,600
Anytime you gotta be ready
for Fado or Warren cash.

1518
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:38,130
Yeah.

1519
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,710
But Verdomme handled him,

1520
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,000
you know,

1521
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,390
on the ground and submitted them.

1522
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,400
I would have loved to seen what
it was like in pride if you,

1523
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,360
he could fight him when fader was at his
peak click back when he beat Minataro.

1524
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:49,830
Yeah.

1525
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,900
But for doom,

1526
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,773
you know,

1527
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,111
he's,

1528
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:53,070
he's overlooked.

1529
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,970
And that argument of WHO's the best and
in terms of like accomplishments as a

1530
00:36:56,971 --> 00:36:57,804
UFC fighter,

1531
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,290
well it's steep a cause Steve has the
only guy to defend the title four times

1532
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:04,440
and it really kind of bums me out that
he's out of the conversation right now.

1533
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,790
You don't hear about a Steve Bay fight
and he's like a to which I feel like he

1534
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:10,800
should get more attention for
this and he's just a normal guy.

1535
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:14,730
Like he has a full time job where as a
firefighter like I feel like more people

1536
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:16,290
should resonate with them because of that.

1537
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:16,650
Yeah.

1538
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,251
But they don't,

1539
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:17,440
I don't,

1540
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,870
he's a fucking great guy.

1541
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,540
It's kind of be an asshole
to get attention these days.

1542
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,591
I don't know.

1543
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:22,861
I mean,

1544
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:26,700
I feel like if he had
beaten DC and you know,

1545
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,720
I mean beat Francis,

1546
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:31,680
that was a big fight because Francis came
into that fight with a lot of hype and

1547
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,540
Overeem,

1548
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,720
knock out Steve Bay,

1549
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:35,010
fall like a fucking champion,

1550
00:37:35,011 --> 00:37:36,210
have really fought like a champion.

1551
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:36,750
Smart.

1552
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,280
And he showed Francis and look,

1553
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:39,270
Francis fought after that.

1554
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:40,470
He was not the same thing.

1555
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:40,740
No.

1556
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,780
When he fought after then
he fight Derrick Lewis.

1557
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,200
You could see he was
still throwing anything.

1558
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,200
He was still fucked up from that last
fight and he admitted it to his credit,

1559
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:49,910
you know,

1560
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:53,260
and he bounced back with the Curtis
blades fight and look fantastic in that

1561
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:53,700
form.

1562
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,050
Cause blades is the awesome wrestler.

1563
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,930
Exactly.

1564
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:56,850
A clay blades.

1565
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,590
Blades is a very athletic wrestler.

1566
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,090
He's huge and he's big.

1567
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:00,631
He's fast,

1568
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:02,010
he's powerful and you know,

1569
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:03,360
and that's twice.

1570
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:04,650
Francis has beaten them twice.

1571
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:05,484
He stopped them.

1572
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,960
That was his first UFC fight.

1573
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,580
So,

1574
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:07,980
um,

1575
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,780
he stopped him then and he
stopped him in this one as well.

1576
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:12,690
So coming into this fight with Kane,

1577
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,410
you know,

1578
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:13,890
there's,

1579
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,240
there's a lot of questions.

1580
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,830
We haven't seen Kane in two years,

1581
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,370
right?

1582
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,300
It's been about two years.

1583
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:18,760
Yeah.

1584
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,220
It may mean longer,

1585
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:20,791
let's say,

1586
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:22,980
when was the last time
Cain Velasquez fought time?

1587
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:23,221
Yeah.

1588
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:24,060
I think you might be right.

1589
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:25,110
If he might be three years.

1590
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,453
It's been a while.

1591
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,390
I know,

1592
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,350
but when,

1593
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:30,030
when he was at the top of the food chain,

1594
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:30,930
when Kane was at the top,

1595
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:33,090
he would put a fucking
storm on these people.

1596
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,860
That was just like a hundred
year storm would never end.

1597
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,371
It's like,

1598
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:38,910
how was this guy have this kind of
insurance CBRE doing to do with that?

1599
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,800
Him To hemo and Mexico City was crazy.

1600
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:42,700
I thought it'd be the other way around.

1601
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:43,090
Yeah.

1602
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:43,781
It was crazy.

1603
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:45,250
And just see Cain tired.

1604
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:45,700
Yeah.

1605
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,540
So here we go.

1606
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:47,800
2016 yeah.

1607
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,521
July 9th.

1608
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:49,480
So two and a half years.

1609
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:49,661
Yeah.

1610
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,190
Almost.

1611
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:50,980
Yeah.

1612
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,970
And that was Travis Brown,

1613
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:54,230
which is just a phenomenal beating.

1614
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,200
Um,

1615
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,060
and that was a UFC 200 yeah.

1616
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,960
And they did the junior dos
Santos won before that was a year,

1617
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,681
you know,

1618
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:03,514
so he's like,

1619
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,750
like he's been active.

1620
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,720
Well he had children's
2013 look at those gaps.

1621
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,320
Yup.

1622
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:08,710
Yup.

1623
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,220
Dang.

1624
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,150
Two year gaps.

1625
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:10,750
Yup.

1626
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,830
Two year gaps.

1627
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,760
One year,

1628
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,331
two year.

1629
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:13,751
Again.

1630
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:14,584
That's rough man.

1631
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,340
It is.

1632
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,000
It is rough.

1633
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,800
Especially when this is your
job and how you get paid.

1634
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,023
Fuck yeah.

1635
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:19,750
Right.

1636
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,390
Yeah.

1637
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,690
Lucky's a heavyweight and they
get taken care of a little more.

1638
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,950
But yeah,

1639
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,310
it's,

1640
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:24,671
yeah,

1641
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:26,440
I mean it's just,

1642
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,970
I wonder how,

1643
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,540
how much you can fix all that
stuff that's going on in the spine.

1644
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,351
You know what I mean?

1645
00:39:32,351 --> 00:39:33,850
It's one thing if a guy gets a knee,

1646
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:37,060
you know he's got a ACL
or something like that,

1647
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,180
you know that you can come back
from that and that's 100% possible.

1648
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,070
But back stuff is weird.

1649
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:43,960
Once it seems like once
things start going,

1650
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,240
it's like you like a car.

1651
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,020
You know,

1652
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,680
once a ball joint blows out and the
axle starts grinding and you're like,

1653
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:50,951
God,

1654
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:51,784
Jesus,

1655
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,470
it's like a bunch of
shits going to go wrong.

1656
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,600
Something that that's like your core.

1657
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,460
Yeah,

1658
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,060
but at his best man,

1659
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,100
he was fucking terrifying.

1660
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,670
Yeah.

1661
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,061
Cause it's just,

1662
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:03,790
I'd never saw it heavyweight with
that kind of endurance ma'am.

1663
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,560
Ever being so scared to Cain Velasquez.

1664
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:05,891
And I was like,

1665
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:08,290
I think I talked about this last time in
your podcast when I was a kid wrestling

1666
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:12,320
in college cause I was like this tiny
ass little white boy wrestler and Kate

1667
00:40:12,321 --> 00:40:15,610
would walk around with justice singlet
straps on and shorts and he had brown

1668
00:40:15,611 --> 00:40:17,470
[inaudible] brown pride
tattooed across his chest.

1669
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,350
He's just huge heavyweight
wrestling d one phrase you.

1670
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,940
I was just like so scared of that guy.

1671
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:22,330
Like Damn,

1672
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,230
look at that guy man.

1673
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:24,720
Just walk around like wonder.

1674
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,750
Probably rip my head off.

1675
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:27,470
Has Brown pride tattooed on his chest.

1676
00:40:27,471 --> 00:40:29,200
Just wearing justice Singlish drafts.

1677
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:30,034
Just huge.

1678
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,203
It's funny,

1679
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,200
I remember him forever,

1680
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:32,860
man.

1681
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,030
Well you know him and DC,

1682
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:39,460
having that kind of a relationship is
such an unique situation for the two

1683
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:41,050
fighters that they have.

1684
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:41,681
You know,

1685
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:46,540
another elite guy that's their size and
they just smashed each other left and

1686
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:47,500
right and work with each other.

1687
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,390
That's what I tried to
create wherever I go.

1688
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:49,741
Um,

1689
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,130
and that's what we're doing
in southern California.

1690
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:52,080
I know one or two let,

1691
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:52,600
uh,

1692
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,100
Aaron Picos a cub,

1693
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:54,731
Swanson is,

1694
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:56,830
we're trying to build a room of
the smaller guys that we can,

1695
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,290
but we don't want to kill each other.

1696
00:40:59,400 --> 00:40:59,650
Right.

1697
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,170
And that's something that I've
always had to control myself.

1698
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:04,600
I've always gone really hard and
something I've had to learn to control.

1699
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:05,320
Um,

1700
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,020
but having that room full of killer so
that when we go to wrestling practice,

1701
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:09,850
like you don't know if you're
going to have a good practice,

1702
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,390
you might be getting beat up on that
day when you go home and bell pissed off

1703
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:13,481
like,

1704
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:13,871
Shit,

1705
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:14,950
I had a bad practice,

1706
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,330
I got taken down with this.

1707
00:41:16,331 --> 00:41:18,160
But that's what makes you
better for the next practice.

1708
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:20,260
If you just go to practice and
beat up on everyone every day,

1709
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,000
you're never going to know
what you need to change,

1710
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,900
what you need to get better at.

1711
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:24,640
So I think that's why,

1712
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,090
uh,

1713
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:29,860
Kanan and DC have gotten so good so
quick at MMA that each other to build off

1714
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:30,060
of,

1715
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,770
you know,

1716
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:31,960
if you can survive it.

1717
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:32,410
Yeah.

1718
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,290
If you survive it.

1719
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:33,980
Yeah.

1720
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,521
And you know,

1721
00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:35,900
like the knock on Aka,

1722
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,750
some people said they trained too
hard cause they're always injured.

1723
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:41,600
But look at the amount of
champions they produced.

1724
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:42,050
Yes.

1725
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,300
Look at the amount of fucking
killers that had come out of there.

1726
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,380
Luke Rockhold,

1727
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,220
DC,

1728
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,053
Kane,

1729
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,230
Khabib.

1730
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,561
I mean,

1731
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:49,700
get the fuck Outta here.

1732
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:52,460
That places a den of assassins,

1733
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,301
you can survive it.

1734
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:53,630
Right.

1735
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,321
That's perfect.

1736
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:54,531
I mean,

1737
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:54,681
yeah,

1738
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:56,720
I mean that's the only way man.

1739
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,290
I mean,

1740
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:57,531
look,

1741
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:02,120
it's not good to spar full clip like old
school lions den days where they used

1742
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:04,250
to beat the shit out of
it or the military days.

1743
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,820
I mean,

1744
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,950
nobody knew a thing back then.

1745
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,660
They didn't know the consequences.

1746
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:09,710
They didn't know what it's like.

1747
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,210
It was speaking of which,

1748
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:11,570
um,

1749
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,500
there's an article in the New York Times
today that I was reading on a guy that

1750
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:20,390
we knew Jason Harris done and
it just talks about his CTE.

1751
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,500
And how bad it was.

1752
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,730
And um,

1753
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,563
you know,

1754
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,460
Jason is a guy who founded this clothing
company that we know called cu you and

1755
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:29,260
um,

1756
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,310
he had been on the podcast before a new,

1757
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,160
um,

1758
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:32,810
it's just,

1759
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:32,940
yeah,

1760
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,630
it's crazy cause something you never
would have guessed how bad it was either

1761
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,240
his guy because every time
I seen him he was happy.

1762
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:39,060
He's awesome.

1763
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,831
People don't know the story.

1764
00:42:39,831 --> 00:42:43,310
He committed suicide
about a year ago or so.

1765
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,343
Yeah.

1766
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,253
And um,

1767
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,453
no one,

1768
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:47,660
no one outside of it.

1769
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:49,000
So I'd comment it was a judge,

1770
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:51,450
just a giant crazy blow and um,

1771
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,363
you know,

1772
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,420
I was uh,

1773
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,310
texting back and forth with
one of his friends and uh,

1774
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:57,630
you know,

1775
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,380
essentially said he had a broken brain.

1776
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:03,590
Man didn't make sense because
when your brain is broken,

1777
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,450
it's like having a broken phone.

1778
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,280
It's like having a broken anything.

1779
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:08,114
It's just broken.

1780
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,111
It's not working.

1781
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:09,944
Right.

1782
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:10,970
It's irrational.

1783
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,900
It doesn't make sense.

1784
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,720
I couldn't imagine the thoughts I had
been going through his head to have that

1785
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,690
happen because like I was texting
him two weeks before it happened,

1786
00:43:17,691 --> 00:43:20,750
like talking about going on a hunt with
him and doing this and that and he's

1787
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:22,820
like talking about how
great the business is doing.

1788
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:24,680
Like you think he's
living the American dream,

1789
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:25,780
like awesome.

1790
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:26,061
You know,

1791
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,020
so it's tough man.

1792
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:27,560
I couldn't even,

1793
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,410
I couldn't even put myself like
to have that kind of torture when,

1794
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:30,561
you know,

1795
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:33,480
he was friends with Donald Junior
and Donald Trump jr and you know,

1796
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:38,490
they hunted together and he was
talking to him just a few hours before.

1797
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,920
Like everything was fine.

1798
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:40,420
Yeah.

1799
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:40,660
You know,

1800
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,290
they were going back and
forth with each other.

1801
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,430
Everybody was blown away.

1802
00:43:43,431 --> 00:43:44,660
Like what happened?

1803
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:45,070
Like how would,

1804
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,340
how could this possibly happen?

1805
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:46,910
Yeah.

1806
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:47,870
But you know,

1807
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:48,591
scary thing,

1808
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:51,200
more reason for us to be smart as
we possibly can with our training.

1809
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,040
Yes.

1810
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,671
100%.

1811
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,140
That's what I was going to get into this,

1812
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:54,620
um,

1813
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,100
the,

1814
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:00,100
that there is a way to train hard but
save your body from especially critical

1815
00:44:02,241 --> 00:44:02,661
damage,

1816
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:03,530
like brain damage.

1817
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,250
There is a way to do that and Dwayne
has been a savior to me because of that.

1818
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:07,701
You know,

1819
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:11,300
Dwayne with his experience of fighting
and being through the gyms and him

1820
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:12,650
probably going to hard himself,

1821
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,430
we've learned a lot of hard drilling and,

1822
00:44:15,431 --> 00:44:20,390
and live drilling through him that has
probably going to prolong my career and

1823
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,680
hopefully my life and,

1824
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:24,320
and not going as hard and just
spark because like before,

1825
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:24,801
before Dwayne,

1826
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:25,491
when I was at huff melt,

1827
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:26,324
we sparred like three,

1828
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,051
four times a week.

1829
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:27,710
We just went,

1830
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,011
you know,

1831
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:28,550
that's what we did.

1832
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,770
We were wrestlers and that's
how we knew how to get better.

1833
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:34,620
It was just go and then he came in and
start teaching us like how to drill and

1834
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:35,180
how to,

1835
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,610
to really get better and your
reaction times everything with,

1836
00:44:38,611 --> 00:44:39,151
with fighting,

1837
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:40,770
without having to beat
yourself up so much.

1838
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:42,120
My injuries were less,

1839
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:43,440
I wasn't getting injured as much.

1840
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,573
Um,

1841
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,770
and I actually got a lot better too.

1842
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,190
Yeah.

1843
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,900
I think sparring is critical.

1844
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:49,830
Thinking it is important,

1845
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:52,950
but I think maybe as critical
or maybe more is drilling,

1846
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,860
and this is with all martial arts,

1847
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,630
including Jujitsu and Jujitsu.

1848
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:58,560
It's,

1849
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:58,831
you know,

1850
00:44:58,831 --> 00:44:59,161
you know,

1851
00:44:59,161 --> 00:44:59,880
you do Jujitsu,

1852
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,690
it's fun.

1853
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,430
So everybody wants to just slap hands,

1854
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:04,170
punched out goals and start rolling.

1855
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:04,460
Yes.

1856
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,293
It's fun.

1857
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:05,971
It's fun to,

1858
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:07,380
it's like a fun game you're doing.

1859
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:08,101
It's a good release.

1860
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:08,934
Yeah.

1861
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:12,990
But the best way to get better
at it is to constantly drill.

1862
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,160
And then you develop these pathways
that are just ingrained in your

1863
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:17,851
subconscious.

1864
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:20,160
And so when you're in
that half guard position,

1865
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:21,570
you immediately go for that under hook.

1866
00:45:21,571 --> 00:45:22,111
You immediately,

1867
00:45:22,111 --> 00:45:23,250
you know the path,

1868
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,610
you know where to go instead of ad
libbing and thinking while you're in the

1869
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:27,480
middle of a role.

1870
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:31,530
And when you see guys that come
from camps where they don't drill,

1871
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:33,480
the only do like one technique
at the beginning of the class,

1872
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:37,740
you'll notice a technical deficiency as
opposed to like someone who comes from

1873
00:45:37,741 --> 00:45:41,430
Hixson school or someone who comes from
a school that's very technical or you

1874
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:41,581
know,

1875
00:45:41,581 --> 00:45:42,960
the Mendez brothers or something.

1876
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,040
You know,

1877
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:44,730
it's just,

1878
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,550
it's so important to look at this,

1879
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:49,080
look at the sport,

1880
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,440
whether it's MMA or kickboxing
or Jujitsu or whatever it is.

1881
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,880
But to look at it like a,

1882
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,050
like a puzzle,

1883
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:59,790
like you're trying to figure out what's
the best way to solve this and you know,

1884
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,530
what Dwayne has done for you.

1885
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:07,220
It's been pretty remarkable as far as
like giving you footwork skills and tools

1886
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,150
to move around and angles.

1887
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,480
And I,

1888
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:09,721
you know,

1889
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:10,720
I've watched you guys drill,

1890
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:13,590
drill and train together and
it's really amazing stuff.

1891
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:14,551
Yeah.

1892
00:46:14,551 --> 00:46:17,660
Stuff that we think is simple and then
we go and teach it to the gym and then

1893
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:18,001
there's like,

1894
00:46:18,001 --> 00:46:18,181
wait,

1895
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:19,770
what can you guys do
that like 10 more times?

1896
00:46:19,771 --> 00:46:20,521
We need to see that again.

1897
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:20,790
It's like,

1898
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:21,623
oh,

1899
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,411
all right.

1900
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:25,570
So we've just been doing like the full
work I've created with Dwayne that he

1901
00:46:25,571 --> 00:46:29,580
wasn't a footwork guy and when he fought
he was trained NATO's and then like

1902
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,400
he's the one that's creating all these
angles with me and now we've created a

1903
00:46:32,401 --> 00:46:33,270
whole new style.

1904
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:37,290
It's so funny that he saw that
kind of while he was fighting.

1905
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:38,490
And then after he was fighting,

1906
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:42,570
he's implementing and on new fighters
and didn't do it himself and he laughs

1907
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:43,140
about it.

1908
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:43,560
Yeah.

1909
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,393
He,

1910
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,610
he wishes he probably would have
had someone like himself coach.

1911
00:46:46,611 --> 00:46:48,450
I'm obviously fucking for sure.

1912
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,320
Yeah,

1913
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,101
everybody does.

1914
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:50,870
Yeah.

1915
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:51,960
He's a fucking wizard man.

1916
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:54,120
He is because he doesn't stop
thinking about it either to,

1917
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:55,950
he's like a Sam Kalvia for strike.

1918
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:56,530
I'm,

1919
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,970
I'm telling you like I have odd,

1920
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,390
the best coaches in the world around me.

1921
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:02,850
Like he's like same
Kalvia of striking in MMA.

1922
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:03,481
Um,

1923
00:47:03,481 --> 00:47:05,730
and I'm trying to convince him to come
to southern California and start a

1924
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:09,390
professional fight team so that we can
help recreate what we do for everyone.

1925
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,650
Because you're going to
get them to move out here.

1926
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,210
Yeah.

1927
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,330
The labs Colorado.

1928
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:12,901
But he does.

1929
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:13,411
He does.

1930
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:16,310
But he also loves being the
best coach in the world anyhow.

1931
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,260
So I'm hoping that I can
convince him enough that he,

1932
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:19,950
he'll do that.

1933
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:20,190
You know,

1934
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:20,520
close.

1935
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,560
You think you are the convincing them.

1936
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,500
I think I'm close to La.

1937
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:25,620
I know you're,

1938
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,453
listen brother,

1939
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:28,650
I know you want to come to California.

1940
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,640
I've never anybody with his detailed,

1941
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:31,110
um,

1942
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:31,240
uh,

1943
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,620
an instruction manual,

1944
00:47:32,621 --> 00:47:35,730
like the way he breaks down his
system no matter what striking.

1945
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,690
I mean it's really remarkable.

1946
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:39,820
Even when he comes into
here to talk to you,

1947
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,490
he'll have a system that you need to
tell him what he wants to talk about,

1948
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:43,091
what he wants to do.

1949
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:45,160
Like the guy doesn't stop thinking he is,

1950
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,450
he's on top of his stuff.

1951
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:47,860
He's OCD in a good way.

1952
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,101
Yeah.

1953
00:47:48,101 --> 00:47:49,360
And the best way in the best way.

1954
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:49,780
Absolutely.

1955
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,820
Well it's like you were saying
about being competitive.

1956
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:52,131
I mean,

1957
00:47:52,131 --> 00:47:53,620
I think it's you,

1958
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,370
the idea that you're going to be this
balance chilled out person and still be a

1959
00:47:57,371 --> 00:47:58,510
fucking world smashing.

1960
00:47:58,930 --> 00:47:59,860
Good luck with that.

1961
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,260
I'm the farthest thing
from relaxed and chill,

1962
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,030
you know,

1963
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,340
I try to now,

1964
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:04,960
but,

1965
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,760
but when you're training
and when you look,

1966
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:11,110
there's a mindset that's required to
beat the best guys and it's not the same

1967
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:13,580
mindset that's required
to get good to get,

1968
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,730
you could get good and be a chilled out,

1969
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:16,480
relaxed person.

1970
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,400
Like say you want to be
a black belt in Jujitsu,

1971
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,690
that's totally possible.

1972
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,930
You can be really good.

1973
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,431
People can go,

1974
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:21,641
Hey,

1975
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:22,471
look at Mike Mann.

1976
00:48:22,471 --> 00:48:23,950
Mike has got great triangle.

1977
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:24,521
Watch them roll.

1978
00:48:24,521 --> 00:48:24,821
Wow,

1979
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:25,654
he's really good.

1980
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,420
But if Mike wants to be the
motherfucker have motherfuckers,

1981
00:48:28,421 --> 00:48:29,410
you better be crazy.

1982
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:29,830
You know,

1983
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,240
you better be God damn crazy.

1984
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,980
You better be like Mike
Tyson when he was young.

1985
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:33,350
Yup.

1986
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,020
Be those Michael Jordan's
you're talking about,

1987
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:36,190
they're always thinking about it.

1988
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,560
[inaudible] Jones Jr yes.

1989
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,351
All of those guys.

1990
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:40,510
You gotta be a fucking crazy person.

1991
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,061
Absolutely.

1992
00:48:41,061 --> 00:48:44,920
Everyone's Roy Jones Jr
played a professional
basketball game the day of his

1993
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:45,754
fight.

1994
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,260
Played a guy named basketball game did.

1995
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:49,300
That's a competitive do
and he's just an athlete.

1996
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:50,980
Yeah,

1997
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,341
I mean,

1998
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:53,590
I just don't think there's any other way.

1999
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,071
You know what I mean?

2000
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:56,290
I think if you're going to win a race,

2001
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:57,730
you're going to have red line the engine,

2002
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,500
because I just don't see how
you're going to beat the best guy.

2003
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,610
Everybody is trying their best.

2004
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:04,683
This is the thing.

2005
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,580
There's so much going on there.

2006
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:07,151
I mean,

2007
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:09,550
you could have like a really good coach,

2008
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:10,720
so you have an advantage.

2009
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:14,690
Technically you could have a really
good group of guys you train with so you

2010
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,500
have an advantage in the environment
that you're training in and there's a lot

2011
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:18,334
of inspiration.

2012
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,100
But if you're not a fucking psychopath,

2013
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,593
good luck.

2014
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:23,770
Good luck.

2015
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:25,210
I agree with you 100% man.

2016
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:26,500
I mean,

2017
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,650
I agree with you cause that's
how I ended up taking notes.

2018
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,520
That's what I'm saying.

2019
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,500
And I'm just letting,

2020
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,220
I mean people who like wonder
why you're so fucking crazy.

2021
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:33,970
Like what?

2022
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:34,990
That's why he's so good.

2023
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:35,750
There's no,

2024
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,150
there's no other way around this game.

2025
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,080
I appreciate it.

2026
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:38,943
I mean,

2027
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:39,881
listen man,

2028
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:40,720
I appreciate it too.

2029
00:49:40,721 --> 00:49:44,530
I mean for me as a fan and as
a professional commentator,

2030
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:45,101
you know,

2031
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:45,934
this is,

2032
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:49,600
it's important to me if there's not
people like you out there that are raising

2033
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:50,434
the bar,

2034
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,651
you know,

2035
00:49:50,651 --> 00:49:52,030
people like you and Henry,

2036
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:53,280
so Hutto and just to,

2037
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,150
you can go through the list of champions,

2038
00:49:55,151 --> 00:49:57,040
the great fighters that are around today.

2039
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,280
This is the best time in the history
of the world to see martial arts.

2040
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,020
There's never been better martial arts.

2041
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,420
Never will the information
so easily accessible to us.

2042
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,180
When I was wrestling as a kid.

2043
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:10,361
Yeah,

2044
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:11,680
you got like we're talking about drilling.

2045
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,530
I remember being a kid and like drilling
the same move thousands of times.

2046
00:50:14,531 --> 00:50:14,771
She was like,

2047
00:50:14,771 --> 00:50:15,521
why are we doing this?

2048
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:17,020
And you're so bored and I learned this,

2049
00:50:17,021 --> 00:50:17,650
you know,

2050
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:21,070
but now I understand it'd be in a
profession how important it is and now how

2051
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:22,000
easy like information.

2052
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:22,421
Like for instance,

2053
00:50:22,421 --> 00:50:23,830
I created my fit to fight program,

2054
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:27,710
like my online academy thing and I'm
showing techniques I've learned over my

2055
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,220
whole entire

2056
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,320
life and it created me
a year to create it.

2057
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:32,780
But I'm giving you info like
think of when I was starting up.

2058
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:36,560
I wish I could have learned from other
world champions just by going online or

2059
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:37,550
when I was a wrestler.

2060
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,250
If I want to learn same
Kalvia as a nutrition plan,

2061
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:41,600
I can just go online and check it out.

2062
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,690
You know he has a whole online program,

2063
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:44,920
correct?

2064
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,110
Yeah.

2065
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:45,791
He has an APP.

2066
00:50:45,791 --> 00:50:47,980
He started called train champ and it's on,

2067
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,830
is a website,

2068
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:52,520
a training lab.com android and Iphone,

2069
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:52,710
is it?

2070
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:53,543
Yeah,

2071
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,081
yeah.

2072
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:54,840
It's uh,

2073
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,780
it'll go through like
his workout routines.

2074
00:50:56,781 --> 00:50:58,670
It goes through the segmentation.

2075
00:50:58,671 --> 00:50:59,330
He puts me on,

2076
00:50:59,330 --> 00:50:59,930
it goes through,

2077
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,570
it has a certain recipes that I've
been on throughout my fight camp.

2078
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,270
The first one he created
was around rob me first.

2079
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,170
Um,

2080
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,090
because we've put so
much work in and go 25.

2081
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:12,890
So we created a whole supplementation
diet plan at workout plan of what I did

2082
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:13,911
and put it out there,

2083
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:14,810
accessible for people.

2084
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:14,961
I mean,

2085
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:15,651
he even has a,

2086
00:51:15,651 --> 00:51:16,340
um,

2087
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,110
you can even get a hair
analysis on his app.

2088
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,240
You send in like they
send you a little kit,

2089
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:23,450
you cut off on the back of your head
where your brainstem is that you cut off

2090
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:25,100
your hair and you see me
where the brain's comes out.

2091
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:26,870
That's really nutrition comes out at,

2092
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,930
that's where all the nutrients for
immune nervous system will come through.

2093
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:31,130
Fuck figured that out.

2094
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:31,610
I don't,

2095
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:31,940
they,

2096
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,190
they burned the hair and
they get the toxins from it.

2097
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,890
That's how I found out I have
too much arsenic in my body.

2098
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:39,230
I feel you eating that
gave you that arsenic.

2099
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,020
He thinks maybe the rice
or maybe my tattoos,

2100
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,160
tattoos.

2101
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,890
He thinks it's a really big tobacco.

2102
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,060
Um,

2103
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:47,390
there's a,

2104
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:47,960
there's a lot of,

2105
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,460
I mean since nick has begun tobacco
real so like if you chew yeah,

2106
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:52,820
chewy.

2107
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,540
I used to shoot,

2108
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:57,080
I used to chew him college that
wouldn't it be still in your system.

2109
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,500
Your body won't get rid of heavy metals
and as you make it year to heavy metals,

2110
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:01,820
you have to do like a detox.

2111
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,113
What do you do?

2112
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:03,441
Uh,

2113
00:52:03,441 --> 00:52:04,131
so I juice,

2114
00:52:04,131 --> 00:52:05,030
I do a lot of juicing.

2115
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:05,720
Um,

2116
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,410
but as you,

2117
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,243
uh,

2118
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,870
like a quarter cup of Cilantro everyday
within all my juices I take us to lunch

2119
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,990
row is effective in getting heavy
metals out of your system big time.

2120
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,670
And same with Mathias burritos too.

2121
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:19,410
Uh,

2122
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:22,610
[inaudible] with juicing you get actually
absorb a lot more of the nutrients

2123
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:24,710
when you cold press juice it
compared to just eating it.

2124
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,640
I can eat a whole table of fruits and
vegetables and all absorb more of the

2125
00:52:28,641 --> 00:52:31,070
nutrients from it if I juice it
rather than just eating it raw.

2126
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,550
Really interesting cause your body's
doesn't break it down the same.

2127
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,300
But then I also take my thigh nine.

2128
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,160
It's a,

2129
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,571
I'm a thianine.

2130
00:52:38,571 --> 00:52:39,410
I don't know how to pronounce it,

2131
00:52:39,411 --> 00:52:40,730
but it's a amino,

2132
00:52:40,731 --> 00:52:42,110
the helps push out heavy metals.

2133
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:42,680
Uh,

2134
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,100
chlorella and Spirulina will
help push out heavy metals.

2135
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,353
Um,

2136
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:48,470
what else do you have me on?

2137
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,450
I tested positive for our sneak back in
the day because I was eating too much.

2138
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:54,284
Sardines.

2139
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:54,621
Yeah,

2140
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:55,550
they're heavy and sardines.

2141
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:55,970
Yeah.

2142
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:58,430
But all I did is just back off
the sardines and it went away.

2143
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,293
They tested it again.

2144
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:00,110
Oh really?

2145
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:00,680
Yeah.

2146
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,270
And you never tried pushing it out,

2147
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:02,471
Huh?

2148
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:03,140
And do shit.

2149
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:03,860
Huh?

2150
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,520
Interesting.

2151
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,150
Yeah.

2152
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,320
Well how did you test it though?

2153
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,160
Blood work.

2154
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:07,771
Blood work.

2155
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:08,630
So the blood work.

2156
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:09,620
So that's one the difference.

2157
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:10,910
So when you do your blood,

2158
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:11,810
it's only right then in there.

2159
00:53:11,811 --> 00:53:12,620
What's in your body?

2160
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:12,990
So when you,

2161
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,240
like when you do your hormone levels,

2162
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:14,581
you have to go in,

2163
00:53:14,581 --> 00:53:18,290
in the morning and your blood drawn
before you eat or drink anything because

2164
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,000
it's what's in your body
right then and there.

2165
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,530
But when you do a hair analysis,

2166
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,620
it's what's in your body.

2167
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,990
Like the last like nine months.

2168
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,320
It's more,

2169
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,930
it tells you more what's in
your actual body over time.

2170
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:28,650
You know,

2171
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,280
cause you might have just pushed arsenic
out of your blood rather than out of

2172
00:53:31,281 --> 00:53:31,620
your,

2173
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,453
out of everything.

2174
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:33,420
He's,

2175
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,253
that's what he told me.

2176
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,870
And he's a mathematician by trade.

2177
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:37,410
Is that what he is?

2178
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:38,940
He's a calculus teacher at a private,

2179
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,300
uh,

2180
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,133
private school.

2181
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:40,561
Uh,

2182
00:53:40,561 --> 00:53:42,300
the world's pes calculus teacher,

2183
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:43,260
he wants some award.

2184
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,453
Um,

2185
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,490
his kids that take the placement
test as advanced placement tests,

2186
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,170
they all got 100%.

2187
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:49,950
I think there's a,

2188
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:51,750
I think there was a kid
that missed one question.

2189
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,350
That's crazy.

2190
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,183
Just one kid.

2191
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,310
There's kids that travel all over the
world to come to his school because of his

2192
00:53:56,311 --> 00:53:57,960
accolades of being a Texas teacher.

2193
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:58,830
Wow.

2194
00:53:58,830 --> 00:53:59,190
Yeah.

2195
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,480
I mean numbers never lie,

2196
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:00,811
you know,

2197
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:03,690
and I think that's what
it was always drawn to.

2198
00:54:03,691 --> 00:54:04,091
Like his,

2199
00:54:04,091 --> 00:54:06,180
his results and his
studies is always numbers.

2200
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,700
Everything comes back to
the numbers of your body,

2201
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,680
your hormone levels of my,

2202
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:11,160
um,

2203
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,120
heart rate variability.

2204
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,320
Everything's done by numbers.

2205
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:14,250
So,

2206
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,083
wow.

2207
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,360
So this is all a system
that he devised himself.

2208
00:54:18,361 --> 00:54:20,280
Did he mean,

2209
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:23,010
does he have a background
in combat sports at all?

2210
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,820
He wrestled.

2211
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,140
So he wrestled at cal state Fullerton.

2212
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:28,350
He was a big time wrestler and then
he was the world's strongest man.

2213
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:28,620
Uh,

2214
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,340
they did like that at Disneyland.

2215
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,510
They used to do the world's strongest
man and he won for like the nation's

2216
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,040
strongest man competition.

2217
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:35,731
So he was huge.

2218
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:36,600
He speak giant.

2219
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,733
How much did he weigh?

2220
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:42,180
Like two 60 to 80 and now
he's probably like 160.

2221
00:54:42,181 --> 00:54:43,050
170 pounds.

2222
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:43,884
That's crazy.

2223
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:44,220
Yeah,

2224
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,031
he was giant.

2225
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,620
Like you could stack a cup on his chest.

2226
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:47,610
His chest was so big,

2227
00:54:47,611 --> 00:54:48,444
you know.

2228
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,080
Um,

2229
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,000
but I would never guess
that looking at him,

2230
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:51,940
he looks like a Merrill Lynch.

2231
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:52,943
He is now,

2232
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,120
he does Iron Mans.

2233
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,130
So he switched up.

2234
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:57,300
He once he,

2235
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:57,920
I keep,

2236
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,100
so I think he had some health issues
from getting so big and being so strong.

2237
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,130
He decided to switch things up and you
just got into his body because he started

2238
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:08,280
doing iron mans and you want to
get better at being an iron man.

2239
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:10,350
So really got into how to train himself.

2240
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:13,980
And now he's done 14 iron mans.

2241
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:15,630
He's qualified for Kona and eyes.

2242
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:16,920
And you do Kona in October.

2243
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:17,550
Wow.

2244
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:18,383
How old is he?

2245
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:19,770
Uh,

2246
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:21,900
let's say 53 or 54.

2247
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:22,770
Wow.

2248
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:25,080
I think he just turned 54
still getting after it.

2249
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:25,711
Yeah man.

2250
00:55:25,711 --> 00:55:27,100
Like he like every day.

2251
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:27,871
I'm going to work out with him.

2252
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:29,330
Yesterday he did and then uh,

2253
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:33,360
when I got there he'll get in the garage
and he'll do like a two hour bike ride

2254
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:36,240
and then we'd get on the treadmill and
he's always doing power intervals and

2255
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,680
well he come in and do a podcast.

2256
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,000
I can talk him,

2257
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:39,501
do he?

2258
00:55:39,501 --> 00:55:40,334
He's a,

2259
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:41,243
he's very,

2260
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,380
he tries to hide everything he does.

2261
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,970
He doesn't want his intellectual
value getting out there.

2262
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:48,270
He puts a lot of work into it and I
think he'd be really good on your podcast

2263
00:55:48,271 --> 00:55:49,290
cause like some of the guys come in,

2264
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:49,680
you're like,

2265
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,000
information goes way over your head.

2266
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,550
But it's nice to be able to listen
to it again and listen to it again.

2267
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,860
I'd like to convince them to come on.

2268
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,360
I think it'd be really interesting.

2269
00:55:57,361 --> 00:55:58,081
I don't know if he would.

2270
00:55:58,081 --> 00:55:59,280
He's a real shelter kind of guy.

2271
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,690
What do you think it'd be easier to do?

2272
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,260
Talk to Wayne and moving to California
or talk Kalvia to come down here.

2273
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:05,700
Man.

2274
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:07,920
I think maybe talking to I
need to come to California.

2275
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:09,303
I don't know.

2276
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:10,130
Um,

2277
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,670
got to get them used to that beach life.

2278
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,593
Yeah.

2279
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,070
I mean he,

2280
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:18,060
so he's been coming down like my fight
camp was 10 weeks long from with him I

2281
00:56:18,061 --> 00:56:18,631
was longer,

2282
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:22,080
but with him it was 10 weeks and he
was flying out three days a week.

2283
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,500
So every Monday he would land,

2284
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:24,850
he would leave Wednesday night.

2285
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:25,360
Wow.

2286
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,980
And we were trained Monday,

2287
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:26,980
Tuesday,

2288
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,780
Wednesday and the hard right.

2289
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,340
I make sure to take like Thursday off.

2290
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:31,900
And then do my other
stuff while he's gone.

2291
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,940
But every week he was
traveling back and forth,

2292
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:35,100
spoke of litigation right there.

2293
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:35,340
Dude,

2294
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,300
I have a more family now.

2295
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:37,601
You know,

2296
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:39,340
like he's lived in my house,

2297
00:56:39,341 --> 00:56:41,860
like he's on the meal
plans with the cal vetoes.

2298
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:43,030
Like he's full bore into it.

2299
00:56:43,031 --> 00:56:45,340
Like he gives me is all I'm,

2300
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:48,070
I'm a very fortunate person that
I've met Dwayne and it's an amazing

2301
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:48,640
relationship.

2302
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,331
Our relationship.

2303
00:56:49,331 --> 00:56:49,481
Yeah.

2304
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:50,230
How close it is.

2305
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,801
It really is.

2306
00:56:50,801 --> 00:56:51,611
And I mean,

2307
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:55,180
that's the ideal when you
can get a mentor and a in a,

2308
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:59,290
a student that have that kind of a bond
together and you can learn so much.

2309
00:56:59,320 --> 00:56:59,561
Yeah.

2310
00:56:59,561 --> 00:57:00,430
And he won't let,

2311
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:04,540
like we have such a good bond now too
that he won't like let bullshit slide

2312
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:06,100
won't be pumping me up for no reason.

2313
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,000
You won't like,

2314
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,331
let me,

2315
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:07,571
I mean,

2316
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:08,351
I'm not a lazy guy,

2317
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,951
but if I was,

2318
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:09,611
he wouldn't let me like,

2319
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:10,660
Miss Practice or,

2320
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:11,410
you know,

2321
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:11,621
I mean,

2322
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:13,510
he almost has to pull me
back more than anything,

2323
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:13,841
but,

2324
00:57:13,841 --> 00:57:14,560
uh,

2325
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,071
he gives me,

2326
00:57:15,071 --> 00:57:17,710
this is true assessment
of what needs to be done.

2327
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,173
Um,

2328
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,960
I obviously lost the pseudo,

2329
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,080
we got home and he has sent texts me.

2330
00:57:23,081 --> 00:57:23,260
He's like,

2331
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:23,351
Hey,

2332
00:57:23,351 --> 00:57:24,011
I'm coming out tomorrow.

2333
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:25,230
I'm going to work out with a wall,

2334
00:57:25,231 --> 00:57:26,320
but I'd love to get some working with you.

2335
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:26,740
We just,

2336
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:27,770
some things we should go over.

2337
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:28,060
I was like,

2338
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,893
all right.

2339
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:32,290
So like I was working out with
him three days after the fight.

2340
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:34,480
What did he say about that exchange?

2341
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,380
Um,

2342
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,140
he says like,

2343
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:36,431
he,

2344
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:39,080
maybe he needs a change and
things on the mits and maybe like,

2345
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,241
so for instance,

2346
00:57:40,241 --> 00:57:41,080
the whole exchange,

2347
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:41,740
uh,

2348
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,270
I think I closed the distance too hard.

2349
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,520
Henry pseudo switched up
who he was as a fighter.

2350
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,840
I think he came out differently,

2351
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:48,040
which was great by Hamm.

2352
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:49,000
He's done great things.

2353
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:49,721
He,

2354
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:50,470
um,

2355
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:53,200
I expected him to maybe run a little
bit more and you came out aggressive.

2356
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:53,921
Um,

2357
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:55,810
and so getting used to
the distance control,

2358
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,090
you know,

2359
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:58,330
not always having a set plan and,

2360
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,620
and going for those Combos,

2361
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:02,110
what I think's going to happen
to be able to adjust on the fly.

2362
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:03,191
And maybe me and him.

2363
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:07,850
Sometimes we are too set on
certain things whether than um,

2364
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,010
reaction type stuff,

2365
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,311
you know,

2366
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:10,870
and I need to react to distance change.

2367
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:12,100
I need to react to things like that.

2368
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,760
It's hard to really change anything on
that fight because I didn't get a chance

2369
00:58:15,761 --> 00:58:16,594
to see it either.

2370
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:17,150
You know,

2371
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:17,710
it was so,

2372
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:18,543
so quick.

2373
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,170
Now do you,

2374
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,390
have you talked to Dana or anyone since,

2375
00:58:22,391 --> 00:58:24,610
I know you said that you guys
would talk in the future,

2376
00:58:24,611 --> 00:58:25,900
but it's been about what,

2377
00:58:25,901 --> 00:58:26,350
how many days?

2378
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:27,460
It's been about a week or so.

2379
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:28,323
It's been two weeks,

2380
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,280
but a week and a half.

2381
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,480
It's been a week and a half now.

2382
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:31,800
Yeah.

2383
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:31,951
Um,

2384
00:58:31,951 --> 00:58:33,600
I haven't heard anything since the,

2385
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,080
the day after the fight.

2386
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,170
I was texting with him the day after the
fight and he said they had to sit down

2387
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:39,670
and figure out what the
plane is kind of thing,

2388
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,061
you know.

2389
00:58:40,061 --> 00:58:40,331
Um,

2390
00:58:40,331 --> 00:58:43,980
but obviously everyone knows
that we want to run it back and,

2391
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:46,030
and it sounds like they do as well too,

2392
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:46,540
so.

2393
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:46,841
Well,

2394
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:48,880
as far as something that
people want to watch,

2395
00:58:48,881 --> 00:58:52,660
whether it's at 35 or 25 I think people
absolutely would like to see that.

2396
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:56,530
I mean at 35 the big selling point would
be Henry gets a chance to become champ

2397
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:56,861
champ.

2398
00:58:56,861 --> 00:58:57,220
Of course,

2399
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,860
they all fight him at 25 and put
my 35 pound belt on the line.

2400
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,400
I really,

2401
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,030
it works that way.

2402
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:01,690
I know it doesn't,

2403
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:04,500
but I'm saying like if
you beat me like I was,

2404
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:05,560
I seriously like,

2405
00:59:05,561 --> 00:59:06,394
I wouldn't even tell him.

2406
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,600
I seriously don't even care.

2407
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,490
Like yeah,

2408
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:09,460
the belts are awesome,

2409
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:11,110
all that stuff in the revenue recognition,

2410
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:11,531
all that stuff.

2411
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:12,730
But to me I'd want that.

2412
00:59:12,731 --> 00:59:13,564
I want that one back.

2413
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:18,630
I want that opportunity back to even just
show how much work in how smart I was

2414
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:21,200
and how I didn't get,

2415
00:59:21,201 --> 00:59:22,034
I didn't get hit.

2416
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,050
I wasn't fragile from being at 25.

2417
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:24,350
Right.

2418
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:25,220
I really wasn't like,

2419
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:28,400
it wasn't like I didn't get beat
because I was at 25 pounder.

2420
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:29,001
I would felt,

2421
00:59:29,001 --> 00:59:29,900
I have no excuses.

2422
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:31,100
I got beat because I got beat.

2423
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:31,670
Right.

2424
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:33,990
I have no excuses that I was too fragile.

2425
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:37,040
And being at one 25 is I felt better
than I've ever felt my entire life.

2426
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:38,780
I just want the chance to prove that.

2427
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:39,590
You know what I mean?

2428
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,740
So that's why I say that I would give
them my belt at 35 big beats me up 20

2429
00:59:42,741 --> 00:59:43,281
fives again,

2430
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:44,240
but well,

2431
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:45,500
obviously take the fight wherever.

2432
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,161
I mean,

2433
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:47,810
I think Ali need Frazier,

2434
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,250
right?

2435
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:48,791
Your sugar.

2436
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:49,850
I needed Tommy Hearns.

2437
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:50,720
I mean this is just,

2438
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,780
this is the nature of the
sport and a guy like him.

2439
00:59:53,781 --> 00:59:53,961
I mean,

2440
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:54,561
I think you,

2441
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:55,850
you and Cody needed each other.

2442
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:56,300
Yeah.

2443
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:00,950
I think there's something about that
kind of intense rivalry that is so

2444
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:02,000
important for,

2445
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:02,940
for,

2446
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,580
for actualizing,

2447
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:05,840
who knows a motherfucker,

2448
01:00:05,841 --> 01:00:05,991
man,

2449
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:06,950
he's good and he's a,

2450
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:08,660
he's a world is a Olympic gold medalist.

2451
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:09,500
He's a competitor.

2452
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:10,641
He knows what he's doing.

2453
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:11,110
Right.

2454
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:11,451
Let me just,

2455
01:00:11,451 --> 01:00:14,420
arguably from his accomplishments is one
of the greatest combat sports athletes

2456
01:00:14,421 --> 01:00:15,254
of all time.

2457
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:19,730
The first guy ever to be an Olympic
gold medalist and a UFC world champion,

2458
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,211
which I,

2459
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:21,230
the gold medalist thing.

2460
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:25,490
I even hold even higher for him than
even the a like obviously UFC champions

2461
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:26,120
huge dry.

2462
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,410
But I wrestled my whole life.

2463
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:30,890
I grew up wrestling and to be an Olympic
gold medalists is a fucking huge thing.

2464
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:32,023
Um,

2465
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:34,130
I still think today wrestling is
the hardest sport I've ever done.

2466
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:35,960
And just to see that achievement,

2467
01:00:35,961 --> 01:00:37,610
especially how young he
did it at and that's,

2468
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:41,240
I almost hold that higher
than him being a UFC champion.

2469
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:44,450
Well also the fact that he was beat by Dj,

2470
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:47,180
he beat by beat by mighty
mouse in the first round.

2471
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:48,170
He gets destroyed.

2472
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:49,340
He gets need to the body,

2473
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,353
taken out,

2474
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,900
beaten up and stopped and humiliated,

2475
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:53,570
right.

2476
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:54,440
Comes back.

2477
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,690
And what was it like two years later?

2478
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,120
I think it was deep and beats him.

2479
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:04,400
I mean becomes the fucking champ and
beats the pound for pound consensus.

2480
01:01:04,401 --> 01:01:05,570
Best fighter on the planet.

2481
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:09,410
And the guy that had held that title
from the very first time it was ever

2482
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:10,490
brought to the UFC.

2483
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,060
He's been the only flyweight
champion until Henry came along.

2484
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:14,600
So,

2485
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,460
and that's another reason
why I want that fight,

2486
01:01:16,461 --> 01:01:16,821
man.

2487
01:01:16,821 --> 01:01:17,541
Like you know what I mean?

2488
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:18,890
Like I know that I'm better than him.

2489
01:01:18,891 --> 01:01:19,724
Obviously.

2490
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:20,980
You're going to give me some shit.

2491
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,180
People are going to give me shit for
saying that because obviously the fight

2492
01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:23,501
they fail.

2493
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:24,770
Think he went down the way it went down.

2494
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:25,431
But guess what?

2495
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,230
I'm better than that motherfucker
and I want to prove it.

2496
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,610
I want the toughest fights.

2497
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,091
I mean,

2498
01:01:29,091 --> 01:01:30,430
that's why I was calling out Max Holloway.

2499
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:30,830
I wanted to,

2500
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:31,860
I wanted to be Henry sued.

2501
01:01:31,861 --> 01:01:34,190
I don't want to call Max
Holloway with Sam Kalvia.

2502
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:37,700
I can be walking around 165
pounds with 6% body fat,

2503
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:38,610
you know,

2504
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:40,160
100% like this guy,

2505
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:40,371
man,

2506
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:41,620
he can stack the weight on me.

2507
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:42,500
You can take it off me.

2508
01:01:42,501 --> 01:01:43,334
I can go,

2509
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,280
I have a secret weapon with Sam Kalvia.

2510
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:45,831
I'm telling you.

2511
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:47,780
And I could have started a secret.

2512
01:01:47,781 --> 01:01:48,141
He just,

2513
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:48,490
yeah,

2514
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:49,323
he blurred.

2515
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,240
But people,

2516
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:51,350
he won't work with everyone.

2517
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,100
He won't do it.

2518
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:52,341
Yeah.

2519
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,490
If you come to them like
unless you fit who we,

2520
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:55,341
he likes.

2521
01:01:55,341 --> 01:01:56,330
If he fit his image,

2522
01:01:56,331 --> 01:01:57,560
like what does it look like?

2523
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:00,170
We worked out of his garage
that which is so crazy.

2524
01:02:00,171 --> 01:02:00,351
You know,

2525
01:02:00,351 --> 01:02:03,620
like he could have a giant facility
with all his hard work in science.

2526
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:03,831
He does,

2527
01:02:03,831 --> 01:02:05,000
but he likes the,

2528
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:06,790
the grit of having it in house.

2529
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,940
Like he gets home from work,

2530
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,560
he's all dressed up in his tie.

2531
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,570
Sometimes we're already there waiting
for him and he's doesn't even change.

2532
01:02:12,571 --> 01:02:15,230
He's out there throwing medicine balls
that are facing his tie and I'll just up

2533
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,220
from the soup from work,

2534
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:16,521
you know,

2535
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:18,050
like he likes that Shit,

2536
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:19,023
you know,

2537
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:20,130
not even be a calculus

2538
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,170
teacher anymore and just be
a string conditioning coach.

2539
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,850
But that's not what he wants.

2540
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:24,360
You know,

2541
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,730
he's not in it for the fame and the money.

2542
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:29,250
He's in it for the science
and the love of doing it.

2543
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,190
I want to see that garage get you pull it,

2544
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,970
pull up his garage because this doesn't,

2545
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:36,690
now I'm thinking about how big
my fucking gym out here is.

2546
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,940
You couldn't even park two cars in it is,

2547
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:40,530
it's a small garage.

2548
01:02:40,531 --> 01:02:41,660
We have one uh,

2549
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:42,900
one squat rack.

2550
01:02:42,901 --> 01:02:46,410
We have a spot to do like our
cleans and are dead lifts.

2551
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,060
What he really has his,

2552
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:50,250
he has three,

2553
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:51,631
four by,

2554
01:02:51,631 --> 01:02:51,841
I don't know,

2555
01:02:51,841 --> 01:02:52,350
three bite.

2556
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:53,170
There it is.

2557
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:53,461
Yeah.

2558
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:54,151
That's crazy.

2559
01:02:54,151 --> 01:02:58,110
So it's a very small two car garage
that has got filled with a bunch of

2560
01:02:58,111 --> 01:02:58,710
murderers.

2561
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:58,951
Yeah.

2562
01:02:58,951 --> 01:03:01,890
He's got like three bikes and
we ride bikes or walking by.

2563
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:02,723
If you were a girl,

2564
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,960
I'll do all the time.

2565
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:04,981
New People,

2566
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:05,940
old people walk by all the time.

2567
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:06,730
We're in the garage and I,

2568
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:09,500
I'm yelling when I'm in there working
out cause he's pushing us like science.

2569
01:03:09,501 --> 01:03:11,220
So our workouts are three hours long,

2570
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:11,820
you know,

2571
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,810
and we're going,

2572
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,900
there's a park across the street and we're
throwing medicine balls at each other

2573
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:16,920
and go to that.

2574
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:18,390
Back to that last one with Pico please.

2575
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:18,721
Yeah.

2576
01:03:18,721 --> 01:03:20,790
You get a chance to see
what's in the garage.

2577
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:21,090
So he,

2578
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:22,620
I guess he parks his car in the driveway.

2579
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:23,101
Oh yeah,

2580
01:03:23,101 --> 01:03:23,640
he doesn't,

2581
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,180
he doesn't park.

2582
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,410
That's the sanctuary man.

2583
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:26,231
It's crazy.

2584
01:03:26,231 --> 01:03:28,030
And he's got the stationary
bikes in there that we were,

2585
01:03:28,031 --> 01:03:28,864
he kills us on.

2586
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:29,461
That's like,

2587
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:29,850
um,

2588
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:31,470
how we push our lactate thresholds.

2589
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,380
So what does he,

2590
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:34,090
he's doing something
with bands right here.

2591
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:34,471
Yeah,

2592
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:34,881
that's true.

2593
01:03:34,881 --> 01:03:35,970
A lot of things with bands,

2594
01:03:35,971 --> 01:03:36,240
right?

2595
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:36,481
Yeah.

2596
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:39,060
Cause you get the east centric
and concentric contraction.

2597
01:03:39,061 --> 01:03:39,301
You know,

2598
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:41,220
you have a straight and he's
like what he's doing it.

2599
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:42,630
There's for your shoulder stability,

2600
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,130
your rotator cuffs.

2601
01:03:44,131 --> 01:03:46,160
I mean with the Jujitsu and the wrestling,

2602
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,220
your shoulders take a beating.

2603
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:47,960
Yeah.

2604
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,440
So that's kind of really
just strengthen it.

2605
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:50,401
Yeah.

2606
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:51,930
I do a lot of cough stuff because,

2607
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,630
well all the different
injuries that I've had,

2608
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:56,100
I do a lot of band stuff with my,

2609
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:56,841
you know,

2610
01:03:56,841 --> 01:03:57,780
like this way,

2611
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,040
the external rotation,

2612
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:00,180
internal rotation stuff.

2613
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:01,423
Bands are great.

2614
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:04,320
Now why bands though as a
PR as opposed to cables,

2615
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,030
cables with a stacks.

2616
01:04:06,031 --> 01:04:06,450
Wait,

2617
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:08,780
why does he use bands pad?

2618
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:09,870
Just what's what we have.

2619
01:04:09,871 --> 01:04:10,081
I mean,

2620
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:12,000
if he had a nice Kaiser machine in there,

2621
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:12,691
maybe we'd use it.

2622
01:04:12,691 --> 01:04:13,291
But I think,

2623
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:14,124
um,

2624
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:15,870
the resistance coming back really,

2625
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:18,060
really wants to pull the
further you extend a band,

2626
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:20,940
the harder it wants to pull you back to
where when you have a weight on there,

2627
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:24,300
it's the exact same weight going in and
out toward the further you extend that

2628
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:24,541
band,

2629
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:25,890
the harder you make it on yourself.

2630
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:26,281
There's,

2631
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:29,280
I think there's just more you can do
with it and it's just very easy and it

2632
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:30,240
takes up no space.

2633
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:31,350
Right.

2634
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:33,090
We do a lot of medicine ball work,

2635
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:33,720
um,

2636
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,880
for our core and for our
shoulders as well too,

2637
01:04:35,881 --> 01:04:39,240
like catching and weird angles
with keeping our balance.

2638
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,140
Um,

2639
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:43,860
we do like a lot of like
kind of like old school shit,

2640
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:45,300
but in a certain way.

2641
01:04:45,301 --> 01:04:46,134
In a certain time.

2642
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:46,830
Yeah.

2643
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:49,770
And so how does he get all
that shit into his garage?

2644
01:04:49,771 --> 01:04:51,690
Does he have to pull stuff
out into the driveway?

2645
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:53,100
There's stuff on the side of his house.

2646
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:56,520
He's got like a little Chessy
stack stuff into and um,

2647
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,050
man,

2648
01:04:58,050 --> 01:04:58,883
we,

2649
01:04:59,190 --> 01:04:59,881
a lot of it's,

2650
01:04:59,881 --> 01:05:00,930
it doesn't need much.

2651
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:01,770
He really doesn't.

2652
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:02,050
And there's a,

2653
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:03,210
there's a lot of work you can do,

2654
01:05:03,211 --> 01:05:04,730
which is body weight that,

2655
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,210
I mean we have a hundred
pound medicine balls,

2656
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:07,890
we've got these big logs
and he makes it like,

2657
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,260
it's almost like a
strong man competitions.

2658
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:11,123
There's a big,

2659
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:14,640
there's a big hill next to his house
that he makes his carry these 800 pound

2660
01:05:14,641 --> 01:05:17,740
logs and we have to farmer's carry
him up the hill and we're doing with a

2661
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:18,101
partner.

2662
01:05:18,101 --> 01:05:19,340
And when I get up so far I dropped him,

2663
01:05:19,341 --> 01:05:19,901
I run back,

2664
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:23,140
I get the hundred pound medicine ball
at the sprint up the hill with it.

2665
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,030
Things like that where
you're pushing your,

2666
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,590
your lactate threshold over time.

2667
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:27,610
Wow.

2668
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:28,410
Yeah.

2669
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:30,430
And how does he schedule the,

2670
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,470
the training sessions?

2671
01:05:31,471 --> 01:05:33,170
Like how does he know what to have you do

2672
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,133
when?

2673
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:39,150
Off of our timeframe of when we want a
peak off of my heart rate variability and

2674
01:05:39,151 --> 01:05:41,130
how my body's reacting to our training.

2675
01:05:41,131 --> 01:05:44,220
Cause maybe I sparred and I
admits too hard with Dwayne.

2676
01:05:44,221 --> 01:05:46,710
So I wake up the next
morning and he realizes,

2677
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:47,940
oh we've got to pull back today.

2678
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:49,650
Like if I push you hard today,

2679
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,340
you're going to go in such a deep hole
that's going to take you a week to come

2680
01:05:53,341 --> 01:05:56,610
out of it to where he only wants
me to get to that really high peak,

2681
01:05:56,910 --> 01:06:00,810
take a day off so that now I can start
coming back up again to where if I just

2682
01:06:00,811 --> 01:06:02,550
continue for four or five days,

2683
01:06:02,551 --> 01:06:03,390
just crushing it,

2684
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:04,980
run as hard as I possibly can.

2685
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:08,040
My body is going to crash so
hard that's going to take me,

2686
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:10,290
it's going to be more of a
detriment to come out of that hole.

2687
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:13,410
Then if I would have just taken a
break in between those days so he'll,

2688
01:06:13,411 --> 01:06:14,140
he'll sketch.

2689
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,540
There are schedules will change.

2690
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,120
We have a,

2691
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,310
we have a schedule from the beginning,

2692
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:17,791
so Sam,

2693
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:18,481
12 weeks out.

2694
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:18,900
Like,

2695
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:19,111
all right,

2696
01:06:19,111 --> 01:06:19,711
this is our planet.

2697
01:06:19,711 --> 01:06:20,544
So what we're going to do,

2698
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:25,320
but then maybe I get sick
or maybe I trained too hard
with Dwayne the day before

2699
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:26,640
and so he'll realize all right,

2700
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:28,380
this next day was a little bit easier.

2701
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:29,850
Even if it's my Jujitsu,

2702
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,410
he knows I'm going to do to practice.

2703
01:06:31,411 --> 01:06:32,010
He's like,

2704
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:32,843
maybe just drill,

2705
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:33,151
you know,

2706
01:06:33,151 --> 01:06:33,751
go with fleet page.

2707
01:06:33,751 --> 01:06:35,400
Just make sure it's like a low base drill.

2708
01:06:35,401 --> 01:06:37,800
Like don't get your heart
rate over such and such.

2709
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:39,390
Which I don't roll with
a heart rate monitor on,

2710
01:06:39,391 --> 01:06:41,460
but I can kind of just guess.

2711
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:42,690
You know how hard I need to go.

2712
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:44,310
Could you,

2713
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:45,580
I guess you could say,

2714
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:45,991
hey buddy,

2715
01:06:45,991 --> 01:06:49,440
do you know anybody that does now it
seems like it would get knocked off or

2716
01:06:49,441 --> 01:06:50,070
something like that.

2717
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:51,180
I mean maybe for drilling.

2718
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,140
Yeah.

2719
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:57,140
So when he's got you doing all this crazy
stuff like dead lifts and plateaus and

2720
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,710
medicine ball work,

2721
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,030
um,

2722
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:00,660
does,

2723
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:05,660
is there like a logic to what exercises
are done when and like how does he like,

2724
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:10,200
cause it seems like you're doing all
this old school stuff like bad ass stuff.

2725
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:12,840
But my question is always like,

2726
01:07:12,841 --> 01:07:14,010
when do you do that?

2727
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:15,343
When is that,

2728
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,590
when is that done?

2729
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,970
Like once a week.

2730
01:07:17,971 --> 01:07:20,700
Is that done early in the training camp?

2731
01:07:20,701 --> 01:07:21,540
Is it done late?

2732
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:23,400
Like when are you doing
strength work and your,

2733
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:26,550
cause you were saying you were
doing cleans like the week out.

2734
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:28,063
Only a,

2735
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,980
so when I'm doing those like a week out,

2736
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:31,730
I'm doing them only a
certain amount of reps.

2737
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:32,953
Um,

2738
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:33,261
you know,

2739
01:07:33,261 --> 01:07:33,770
I'm not,

2740
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:38,030
maybe not taxing my body for as long as
I would an earlier camp and even though

2741
01:07:38,031 --> 01:07:38,571
I'm going heavy,

2742
01:07:38,571 --> 01:07:39,860
maybe I'm only doing two sets,

2743
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:40,370
you know,

2744
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:45,370
just to keep my central nervous system
strong because other than just taxing

2745
01:07:45,501 --> 01:07:45,951
yourself,

2746
01:07:45,951 --> 01:07:46,281
you know,

2747
01:07:46,281 --> 01:07:48,710
are there certain times like
there's certain days he needs,

2748
01:07:48,711 --> 01:07:52,220
I need to get explosive power work
or some days I needed you cadence,

2749
01:07:52,221 --> 01:07:52,820
fast,

2750
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:53,630
fast feet,

2751
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:54,170
um,

2752
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:58,760
cardio work and he has that all
mapped out on what days or what,

2753
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:03,050
what weeks are what depending on where
I'm at my fight camp or if I'm going 20

2754
01:08:03,051 --> 01:08:05,560
fives and if I want to stay
as strong as it was at 35,

2755
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,433
things like that.

2756
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,000
Or if I end up going 45,

2757
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:08,690
um,

2758
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:09,560
to be able to keep my,

2759
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:10,130
my,

2760
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:10,940
my cardio up.

2761
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,410
Because the thing was if I were,

2762
01:08:12,411 --> 01:08:13,340
if I would go 45,

2763
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:15,770
I'm gonna have to put so much more muscle
on the worry that I'm going to lose

2764
01:08:15,771 --> 01:08:16,540
cardio.

2765
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:16,790
Right.

2766
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:18,920
And nobody wants to be able to
keep that lactate threshold.

2767
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:22,760
And me keep my cardio if I'm able
to walk around at 165 pounds.

2768
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:23,601
Now,

2769
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:25,610
what other stuff does he
have you doing for recovery?

2770
01:08:25,611 --> 01:08:27,020
You doing any sauna work?

2771
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:28,280
Are you doing ice baths?

2772
01:08:28,281 --> 01:08:29,180
Like what kind of stuff?

2773
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,740
I have an infrared sauna.

2774
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:31,341
I do,

2775
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:33,680
I'm a do red light therapy.

2776
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:34,701
I do.

2777
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:35,534
Um,

2778
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:37,823
uh,

2779
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:39,290
what do you mean by red light therapy?

2780
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,770
There's a machine that I have
in my house is called a a juve.

2781
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:43,810
It's um,

2782
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:44,690
a big red light.

2783
01:08:44,691 --> 01:08:49,430
It says 680 to 880 nanometer light that
I stand in front of it for a certain

2784
01:08:49,431 --> 01:08:50,570
amount of time to,

2785
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:51,290
um,

2786
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:52,790
not only increase my testosterone,

2787
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:54,110
but to help recovery and my,

2788
01:08:54,111 --> 01:08:54,660
uh,

2789
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:57,080
I Mitochondria and my cells
and flushing my body out.

2790
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,393
Um,

2791
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,270
uh,

2792
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,140
what was the thing look like?

2793
01:09:00,141 --> 01:09:00,441
Whoa.

2794
01:09:00,441 --> 01:09:01,251
Look at that dude.

2795
01:09:01,251 --> 01:09:02,084
You're in the future.

2796
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,100
Yeah.

2797
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:03,381
Is that,

2798
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:04,280
you know,

2799
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:06,760
it's jacked.

2800
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,310
Yeah.

2801
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:07,820
Um,

2802
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,121
but yeah,

2803
01:09:08,121 --> 01:09:09,380
I have one of those in my garage.

2804
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:11,660
I have a infrared sauna in my garage.

2805
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:12,230
Um,

2806
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:13,460
I do that thing.

2807
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,940
Well there's new ones now that are huge.

2808
01:09:16,941 --> 01:09:18,140
I gets as big as my body.

2809
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:18,711
Um,

2810
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:20,000
that one's that go on
the back of your door.

2811
01:09:20,001 --> 01:09:22,580
They have travel ones you can take
with you that it's really small.

2812
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:24,770
The reason why I got into it was for,

2813
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:25,823
uh,

2814
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:29,840
increasing my dishwasher on the moon
and the motility of my sperm Holla.

2815
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:30,320
Yeah.

2816
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:30,731
Cause I was,

2817
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:31,011
I was,

2818
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:31,641
I was having,

2819
01:09:31,641 --> 01:09:32,474
um,

2820
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:36,590
my question was low and I wanted
to increase it and I saw this,

2821
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:37,100
um,

2822
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:37,761
through Matt Brown,

2823
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:38,061
actually,

2824
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:40,260
Matt Brown is the one that Kinda
got me this when I was at Colorado.

2825
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:40,961
Shout out to the man,

2826
01:09:40,961 --> 01:09:42,440
he's got some awesome training equipment.

2827
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:43,101
He's,

2828
01:09:43,101 --> 01:09:44,600
and he's a very knowledgeable,

2829
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:46,810
very well read guy and a,

2830
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:50,160
you wouldn't like pure and guests
that when I had him on the podcast,

2831
01:09:50,161 --> 01:09:51,590
that's one of the things
a lot of people said.

2832
01:09:51,591 --> 01:09:51,790
They go,

2833
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:53,030
I thought that the guy was a caveman.

2834
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:54,740
I write kind of is,

2835
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:56,690
he's also kind of brilliant.

2836
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,510
He wants to be the caveman like manly man.

2837
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,620
But he's very smart about,

2838
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:02,973
um,

2839
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,430
so he's the one that turned me on to that.

2840
01:10:04,431 --> 01:10:06,650
And so I got into it and,

2841
01:10:06,651 --> 01:10:07,100
uh,

2842
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,470
I wanted to increase my
testosterone but also read about,

2843
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:10,040
um,

2844
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,330
increasing motility of my sperm.

2845
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:13,490
I was trying to have a kid and we're
having trouble and this and that.

2846
01:10:13,491 --> 01:10:14,301
And it could be,

2847
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:15,500
that could have been my diet.

2848
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:18,410
I switched so much up that I
can't tell you which one it was.

2849
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:18,920
You know,

2850
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,150
cause Sam helped me out.

2851
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:21,260
This helped me out.

2852
01:10:21,261 --> 01:10:21,441
I mean,

2853
01:10:21,441 --> 01:10:23,120
so I'm doing that.

2854
01:10:23,121 --> 01:10:24,560
I'll do hyperbaric chamber.

2855
01:10:24,561 --> 01:10:25,910
I'll do cryotherapy.

2856
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,560
How often do you do
the hyperbaric chamber?

2857
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:28,040
Um,

2858
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,680
only when I need it because
it can mess with your,

2859
01:10:30,681 --> 01:10:31,514
um,

2860
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,050
your hematocrit.

2861
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:33,341
You know,

2862
01:10:33,341 --> 01:10:35,600
if I'm going to do a lot of
altitude training as well too,

2863
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:38,660
I'm trying to increase my red
blood cell count and my hematocrit.

2864
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:39,320
Um,

2865
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,050
and then when you go and you
get in to a hyperbaric chamber,

2866
01:10:42,051 --> 01:10:43,610
you're breathing 100% oxygen.

2867
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:45,260
So if I'm in it too much

2868
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,140
lower my hematocrit right.

2869
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,430
But I do a lot of,

2870
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:49,830
he has,

2871
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:50,663
he has the altitude.

2872
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,690
Same as an altitude machine he
has me used is called Alto lab.

2873
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:54,381
Um,

2874
01:10:54,381 --> 01:10:56,450
I breathe it into it for a certain
amount of time and it's again,

2875
01:10:56,451 --> 01:10:57,830
another program he created.

2876
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,240
The company was around,

2877
01:10:59,241 --> 01:11:03,410
but he created the program that I'm
supposed to do to put my body in a hypoxic

2878
01:11:03,411 --> 01:11:07,010
state for only a certain amount of time
because you can overtrain yourself that

2879
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:08,420
way as well to um,

2880
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:10,340
to increase my capillaries,

2881
01:11:10,341 --> 01:11:10,810
um,

2882
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:11,180
uh,

2883
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:14,250
increased the date of
vasodilation and my veins

2884
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,290
as well as increase red blood increase,

2885
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,580
increased red blood cells.

2886
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:19,110
That's amazing because you know,

2887
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,490
one of the things that's a big,

2888
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:21,373
um,

2889
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:23,700
well I don't know if it's a misconception,

2890
01:11:23,701 --> 01:11:26,610
but it's one of the things that people
always talk about is that you should

2891
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,820
train at altitude and you did that,

2892
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:33,120
you went to Denver and a lot of people
do that and they find benefits in that.

2893
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:37,860
But the thought process now seems to
be that you get more worked on it.

2894
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:39,540
C level EXEC.

2895
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:41,130
So I thought the same thing.

2896
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:42,200
And then I met Sam and I,

2897
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,930
and I actually felt this it and understand
it that your body can't recover the

2898
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:49,110
same or he can't push as hard at altitude.

2899
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:53,360
And your body actually gets a more dance
at sea level when you're working out,

2900
01:11:53,361 --> 01:11:55,350
are you able to push harder
and your recovery is better?

2901
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:56,603
Um,

2902
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:59,700
and same reason why I think sleeping in
and out to two went and help either Q

2903
01:11:59,701 --> 01:12:01,440
because your body won't
recover a completely.

2904
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:02,640
Um,

2905
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,560
so I feel better training at sea level,

2906
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:09,170
but I use this alto lab for only a
certain amount of time on and off with

2907
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:10,590
breathing techniques.

2908
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:13,320
And I felt the best of the
best benefits with that.

2909
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,520
So what does this thing look like?

2910
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,633
You see pope,

2911
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,590
it's a so loud.

2912
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:21,590
I was just a mask and it's got a bunch
of cylinders on it and the more cylinders

2913
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:22,443
you stack on it,

2914
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,530
the more it's a emulating the,

2915
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:26,364
uh,

2916
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,353
the altitude.

2917
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,840
So it's like breathing at 40,000 feet
when you stack a lot of them on there.

2918
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:31,741
And,

2919
01:12:31,741 --> 01:12:32,574
um,

2920
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:33,990
so you're,

2921
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:37,860
you're hooked up to this thing
how breathing gas mask on it?

2922
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,101
Yeah.

2923
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:38,851
You could use that word.

2924
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:39,930
It's just like a snorkel,

2925
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:40,490
right?

2926
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,120
Or it could be a gas mask kind of thing.

2927
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:43,500
And you're doing it while you're training?

2928
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:44,170
No,

2929
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:45,000
no,

2930
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,960
not doing it while I'm training,

2931
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,780
I'm doing it while I'm
resting on certain days,

2932
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:49,740
like a certain schedule.

2933
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:50,940
I can't do it all the time.

2934
01:12:50,941 --> 01:12:52,560
This thing without training,

2935
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:54,030
this thing jacks up your,

2936
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:54,990
your cardio.

2937
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:56,200
Yes it will.

2938
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,450
It'll help with your,

2939
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,313
what do I buy one of these?

2940
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:00,930
I'll tell that you just,

2941
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:01,890
you just breathe.

2942
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:02,881
Yeah.

2943
01:13:02,881 --> 01:13:04,050
But I'd have to give you the,

2944
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:04,521
the,

2945
01:13:04,521 --> 01:13:05,200
um,

2946
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:09,000
technique because you can overdo it as
well and you can end up hurting yourself

2947
01:13:09,001 --> 01:13:09,600
as well too.

2948
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,680
And how long do you do it?

2949
01:13:10,681 --> 01:13:10,861
Four.

2950
01:13:10,861 --> 01:13:11,350
It says here,

2951
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:14,580
10 minutes or 60 minutes.

2952
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:17,490
And then there's a program,

2953
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:20,740
initial 15 day program and our breathing
session will produce performance

2954
01:13:20,741 --> 01:13:22,710
affects that lasts up to three weeks.

2955
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:23,544
Jesus.

2956
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:25,350
Wow.

2957
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:27,150
So for a 60 minute sessions,

2958
01:13:27,151 --> 01:13:29,280
six 10 minutes sessions,

2959
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:30,450
10 minutes.

2960
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:31,370
What's wrong with my voice?

2961
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:34,390
It's six 10 minute sessions or 10,

2962
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:35,761
six minutes on,

2963
01:13:35,761 --> 01:13:36,594
four minutes off.

2964
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:37,620
So six,

2965
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:39,090
six per hour.

2966
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,620
And so you're basically doing these
intervals where you're just breathing.

2967
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:45,071
Yeah.

2968
01:13:45,071 --> 01:13:46,680
And it's one of those things.

2969
01:13:46,681 --> 01:13:47,191
So you have a,

2970
01:13:47,191 --> 01:13:47,930
you have a auction,

2971
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:48,670
um,

2972
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:49,381
reader on your finger.

2973
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:51,930
It tells you your oxygen levels because
you want to put yourself in a hypoxic

2974
01:13:51,931 --> 01:13:53,750
state and there's certain levels up.

2975
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:54,970
Sam wants me to keep my body,

2976
01:13:54,971 --> 01:13:57,480
I just want me to go too low either
because your body will start producing a

2977
01:13:57,481 --> 01:13:59,190
hormone that tells you you're dying.

2978
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:00,000
Oh Geez.

2979
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,310
Yeah,

2980
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,143
and I've

2981
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:06,420
won Archeletta when I first met him I was
coaching the ultimate fighter came out

2982
01:14:06,421 --> 01:14:06,901
and told me,

2983
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:07,081
he's like,

2984
01:14:07,081 --> 01:14:07,351
hey man,

2985
01:14:07,351 --> 01:14:08,071
I've been breathing this thing.

2986
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:08,940
Sam tells me to do it.

2987
01:14:08,941 --> 01:14:09,240
I'm like,

2988
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:09,900
all right,

2989
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,321
what do I do?

2990
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:10,561
He's like,

2991
01:14:10,561 --> 01:14:12,130
just get your levels as low as you can.

2992
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,421
Cool.

2993
01:14:13,421 --> 01:14:15,760
I ended up passing out cause he had,

2994
01:14:15,761 --> 01:14:16,970
so I'm,

2995
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:17,770
I'm,

2996
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:18,161
you know me,

2997
01:14:18,161 --> 01:14:19,150
I'm very competitive,

2998
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:19,331
right?

2999
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:19,990
And I was like,

3000
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:21,970
I was looking at it and you're
supposed to do for six minutes.

3001
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:22,300
And I'm like,

3002
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:22,421
Oh,

3003
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:23,500
I've got like 30 seconds left.

3004
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:24,191
But it's getting hard.

3005
01:14:24,191 --> 01:14:26,560
Like I can make it the rest 30 seconds.

3006
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:27,521
Next thing I remember,

3007
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:29,170
I'm like seizuring on a couch.

3008
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:33,550
I fling this auction unmonitored off
my finger and then I wake up a couple

3009
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:33,880
minutes later I'm like,

3010
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:34,511
Oh shit.

3011
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:35,290
I passed out,

3012
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:35,621
you know,

3013
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:36,454
so wow.

3014
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:37,120
You could,

3015
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:37,451
yeah.

3016
01:14:37,451 --> 01:14:38,650
You don't want to do too much.

3017
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:38,880
Yeah.

3018
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,960
A 40,000 feet seems a little excessive.

3019
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:41,511
Yeah.

3020
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:41,890
Oh yeah.

3021
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:43,900
But it seems like it would
be amazing for hikers to,

3022
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:46,420
or someone who does want to climb
Everest or something like that.

3023
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:48,400
Get yourself to a person that started,

3024
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:51,940
I think they started it for some sort
of disease and obviously everyone runs

3025
01:14:51,941 --> 01:14:53,630
with it for um,

3026
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:55,150
getting better results through it.

3027
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:56,340
I'm buying once those motherfuckers,

3028
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:58,180
if I can get better
endurance just sitting here.

3029
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,651
But it's work though,

3030
01:14:59,651 --> 01:14:59,861
Dude.

3031
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:00,700
Like you'll end up oh yeah,

3032
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:01,890
you'll sweat it too.

3033
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:02,590
Yeah.

3034
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:05,260
So it's just because it's hard
to breathe with the thing.

3035
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:05,561
Yeah.

3036
01:15:05,561 --> 01:15:05,630
Oh,

3037
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:06,790
so you want to get a yeah,

3038
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:07,630
I mean you're not getting it.

3039
01:15:07,631 --> 01:15:10,650
Sometimes I'll have to like pull off
and get some fresh air and get back onto

3040
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:10,901
it.

3041
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:12,080
Like you want to keep your levels that,

3042
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,010
cause you want to go too low.

3043
01:15:13,011 --> 01:15:13,630
It can,

3044
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:14,381
you'll pass out.

3045
01:15:14,381 --> 01:15:15,820
And is it a breathing exercise?

3046
01:15:15,821 --> 01:15:16,960
Like are you doing anything?

3047
01:15:16,961 --> 01:15:18,400
Are you pushing or you learn?

3048
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:18,641
Yeah.

3049
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:21,220
You learn how to breath
of fire type stuff.

3050
01:15:21,221 --> 01:15:23,770
You've learned how to get the carbon
dioxide out of your body as well too.

3051
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:26,230
Like you really learn a
lot about breathing when
you're doing this sink cause

3052
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:30,070
you have the oxygen monitor on your
finger and when you want to increase your

3053
01:15:30,071 --> 01:15:30,641
oxygen levels,

3054
01:15:30,641 --> 01:15:31,780
I'll let more air out.

3055
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:32,440
Right?

3056
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,900
But if I want to decrease
my oxygen levels faster,

3057
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:38,170
I'll take shallow breaths and I could
learn that I can get my body in a hypoxic

3058
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:39,400
state faster by doing it.

3059
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:41,680
But then when I need to like
get more oxygen in my body,

3060
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,400
I'll make sure to excel more than carbon
dioxide and then breathe in more air.

3061
01:15:45,401 --> 01:15:45,940
So you kind of,

3062
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:47,770
it does teach you how to
breathe better as well too.

3063
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:49,690
And then you're creating more capillaries,

3064
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:50,710
more lung strength,

3065
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:51,401
a lot of stuff.

3066
01:15:51,401 --> 01:15:53,800
So it's going to be mad at me
for probably talking about that.

3067
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:56,590
Yeah,

3068
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:56,831
no.

3069
01:15:56,831 --> 01:15:58,090
Are you breathing in through your nose?

3070
01:15:58,091 --> 01:15:59,200
You're breathing through your mouth.

3071
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:01,150
I have my mouth by nose closed.

3072
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,080
Pinched off.

3073
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,160
Is your nose functional?

3074
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:05,091
Not so good.

3075
01:16:05,091 --> 01:16:05,440
All right,

3076
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,273
well let's as good.

3077
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:07,220
Yeah,

3078
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:07,990
my rights.

3079
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:08,823
Most fighters,

3080
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,433
right sides.

3081
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:11,590
I mean I'm a mouth breather.

3082
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,180
When have you ever thought
about getting an opened up?

3083
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,230
I have,

3084
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:16,020
but I was told that um,

3085
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:17,561
for me to get it done,

3086
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:18,580
she's going to happen again.

3087
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:19,121
Like it'll,

3088
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:19,540
it'll,

3089
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:22,660
it'll weaken the structural integrity
and my nose and cause they got to like

3090
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:26,290
carve out the cause my nose insights
just crooked so they'd have to carve it

3091
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:26,950
out.

3092
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:30,160
And so they say that it'll just happen
and I'll have to get it done again.

3093
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:31,420
So I had it done.

3094
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:33,100
It was one of the best
things I've ever done.

3095
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,210
I haven't seen that flag,

3096
01:16:34,211 --> 01:16:35,800
but it's one of the best
things I've ever done.

3097
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,233
Ready.

3098
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,670
That sounds so good.

3099
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:41,290
Like I'll be in yoga.

3100
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:44,020
I've been doing yoga the last like four
days because I've been trying to keep my

3101
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:46,570
weight down and they'll make you breathe
in through your nose and I'm just in

3102
01:16:46,571 --> 01:16:50,350
the back of the house and
you're trying to breathe in.

3103
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:51,311
It's the worst.

3104
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:52,990
When I used to do yoga
for how to fix that,

3105
01:16:52,991 --> 01:16:54,270
guy would tell me breathe three no's.

3106
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:54,611
I'm like,

3107
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:55,010
I don't,

3108
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,320
my basically don't have a nose.

3109
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:57,910
You can fart my face.

3110
01:16:57,911 --> 01:16:58,770
I barely smell it.

3111
01:16:58,771 --> 01:16:59,830
This thing's useless.

3112
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:00,791
Yes,

3113
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:01,421
exactly.

3114
01:17:01,421 --> 01:17:01,900
That.

3115
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:03,670
I hate being a mouth
breather at night too.

3116
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,190
I wake up in the morning
with like the driest worst.

3117
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:08,320
Well,

3118
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,100
I mean it's just part of the part

3119
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:10,581
of the struggle,

3120
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:11,030
right?

3121
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:11,863
Yeah.

3122
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:13,460
So a cryotherapy.

3123
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:14,390
How often are you doing that?

3124
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:15,860
Um,

3125
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:16,850
when I have the time,

3126
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,110
I mean Sam's,

3127
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,590
all the same stuff and the
training I do is a full time job,

3128
01:17:21,591 --> 01:17:22,730
more than a full time job.

3129
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:23,990
And so it takes a lot.

3130
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:24,231
Um,

3131
01:17:24,231 --> 01:17:25,820
depending on how much recovery I need.

3132
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:26,960
Um,

3133
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,740
we're looking to open up her own gym and
putting her own crowd therapy in it so

3134
01:17:30,741 --> 01:17:31,790
I can use it more often.

3135
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:36,150
Looking to team up with a company that
wants to join forces with us and come

3136
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:39,200
into our gym and where they have
hyperbaric chambers on hand,

3137
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:40,040
which I owned my own,

3138
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:42,470
but I haven't been using it
because I haven't had hooked up.

3139
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:43,450
Um,

3140
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:44,001
what do you,

3141
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:46,060
what company are you going
with right now because of you?

3142
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,200
You have you gone to Cryo healthcare?

3143
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:52,610
They have the best fucking
crowd is there's like a room
or is it like the little

3144
01:17:52,611 --> 01:17:56,600
one's room isn't the room one is the one
you want because the little room one is

3145
01:17:56,601 --> 01:17:57,500
cold air.

3146
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:57,920
Okay.

3147
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,690
You know the woman who died in Vegas,

3148
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:00,550
you know,

3149
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,280
store,

3150
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,210
she worked at a cryo place and
she did it herself unfortunately.

3151
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:10,211
And she had it adjusted wrong and so
it was like below her nose and she was

3152
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:14,600
breathing in this stuff and she
blacked out and froze to death.

3153
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,970
She was working there
by herself unsupervised.

3154
01:18:16,971 --> 01:18:18,200
You're never supposed to do that.

3155
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:20,460
He never supposed to climb it in
one of those things on supervisors,

3156
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,650
I would have never guessed the one.

3157
01:18:21,651 --> 01:18:22,860
They haven't cryo healthcare.

3158
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:24,920
It's not liquid nitrogen that you,

3159
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,270
that's on your body.

3160
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:27,560
It's cold air.

3161
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,500
So they're freezing the
air with liquid nitrogen.

3162
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:31,370
And this is it right here.

3163
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,490
I took a Davidson Claire who's a,

3164
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:35,450
um,

3165
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:40,450
he's a professor at Harvard and one
of the leading guys in the longevity

3166
01:18:40,581 --> 01:18:41,414
movement.

3167
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,160
And I took them there the other day.

3168
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,030
It's,

3169
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:44,600
uh,

3170
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,270
you walk in that chamber and you know,

3171
01:18:47,271 --> 01:18:47,491
you,

3172
01:18:47,491 --> 01:18:47,960
you take,

3173
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:52,310
you put a little mask on your face and
earmuffs on just to stop frost by 240

3174
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:53,144
degrees.

3175
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:54,760
I'll take you there right now if you want.

3176
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:55,520
Yeah,

3177
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,020
we'll do it right.

3178
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:56,280
We have,

3179
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,021
we get out of here man.

3180
01:18:57,021 --> 01:18:57,260
Yeah.

3181
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,850
It's the shit.

3182
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:00,063
It's the shit.

3183
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:02,210
You're in there for
three minutes and it's,

3184
01:19:02,211 --> 01:19:04,760
so I've done the below
the neck and it's hard.

3185
01:19:04,761 --> 01:19:05,060
Yeah.

3186
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:05,570
It's like God,

3187
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:08,840
it's cold but it's nothing like this
thing cause your fucking head is frozen.

3188
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:11,060
I don't feel like those are the ones that
have stayed in like three minutes when

3189
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:11,960
you're talking about a very hard,

3190
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:12,561
exactly.

3191
01:19:12,561 --> 01:19:13,010
Yeah.

3192
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:13,843
Yes.

3193
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:14,460
I'm glad.

3194
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:15,620
Nice down there.

3195
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:16,040
Yeah.

3196
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:16,451
There's that.

3197
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:18,440
There's a company called o two
that wants to team up with us.

3198
01:19:18,441 --> 01:19:18,831
Like I said,

3199
01:19:18,831 --> 01:19:20,090
they have red light therapy.

3200
01:19:20,091 --> 01:19:22,070
Even you do have crowded therapy.

3201
01:19:22,071 --> 01:19:23,210
Where do float tanks?

3202
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:24,250
I'm sorry,

3203
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:26,690
I was listening to your
podcast a while ago.

3204
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:27,310
Beautiful.

3205
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:28,610
And do that seriously.

3206
01:19:28,611 --> 01:19:29,091
For me.

3207
01:19:29,091 --> 01:19:31,790
It's like the only form of meditation
I can get because otherwise I have too

3208
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:32,300
much stuff going on.

3209
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,140
I have my phones,

3210
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:34,760
I got people asking me to do this.

3211
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:36,890
People ask me to do that like I have.

3212
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,680
It's awesome cause you go in there and
you have to like get rid of everything.

3213
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,150
I usually fall asleep.

3214
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:44,420
I usually go in there for the most part
I help maybe like 30 minutes I'll be

3215
01:19:44,421 --> 01:19:45,031
there and relax.

3216
01:19:45,031 --> 01:19:45,741
I'll be like meditating,

3217
01:19:45,741 --> 01:19:48,410
thinking about stuff and then
eventually I will wake up like,

3218
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:48,771
oh damn,

3219
01:19:48,771 --> 01:19:49,380
I fell asleep.

3220
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:50,990
If you're ever around this area.

3221
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:52,010
I got one right there.

3222
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,300
You can climb at anytime you want.

3223
01:19:53,301 --> 01:19:54,560
I would love to text me.

3224
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:55,070
Okay,

3225
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:55,850
I'll open it up.

3226
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:56,571
They have a chin here,

3227
01:19:56,571 --> 01:19:56,830
man.

3228
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:57,770
It's this one right here.

3229
01:19:57,771 --> 01:19:59,030
The float lab version.

3230
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:00,170
Have you seen this one?

3231
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:00,651
Have you seen the one?

3232
01:20:00,651 --> 01:20:00,950
I have.

3233
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:02,120
No fucking huge.

3234
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:03,373
It's giant.

3235
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:05,690
It's like you can't touch
the tall nine feet long.

3236
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:06,580
No slouch.

3237
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,390
It's enormous and the guy
who had credit who made it,

3238
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:11,370
this guy crash,

3239
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:15,030
he's the reason why they're
high level tanks today.

3240
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:18,570
He's a mad scientist and he's the
guy who was behind the float lab.

3241
01:20:18,571 --> 01:20:21,870
When you see how extensive the
purification system this guy has,

3242
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:26,280
he's got like water purification systems
that you would use for commercial

3243
01:20:26,281 --> 01:20:27,114
purposes,

3244
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:28,230
like for a fucking,

3245
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:28,790
like a,

3246
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,300
a block,

3247
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:32,670
like a city block and it's
just for this one tank.

3248
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:33,720
It's crazy.

3249
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,980
And it's probably a pretty expensive,

3250
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,730
it's very expensive and he's
a maniac and so he makes the,

3251
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:41,730
these insanely overdeveloped tanks.

3252
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,760
And when I first got into tanks was around
2000 you had these like kind of thin

3253
01:20:46,981 --> 01:20:47,850
plastic ones,

3254
01:20:47,851 --> 01:20:48,541
which were fine.

3255
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:49,021
They worked.

3256
01:20:49,021 --> 01:20:50,190
I had one in my basement,

3257
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:53,370
but then it busted and the
w the water spilled out.

3258
01:20:53,371 --> 01:20:55,620
I had a fucking get my basement drained.

3259
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:56,460
It was a nightmare.

3260
01:20:57,180 --> 01:21:00,630
And the guy who was fixing the
tank told me about the float lab,

3261
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:00,901
which is,

3262
01:21:00,901 --> 01:21:02,550
they have a place in Venice,

3263
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:03,660
in a place in Westwood.

3264
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,890
And uh,

3265
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:05,830
they were fucking,

3266
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:07,160
this whole spa,

3267
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,760
the whole industry was dying.

3268
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,530
It was going away and
I didn't understand it.

3269
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:10,861
I was like,

3270
01:21:10,861 --> 01:21:12,210
how is this so awesome?

3271
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:13,110
But no one,

3272
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:13,681
no one knows.

3273
01:21:13,681 --> 01:21:14,810
It was too much so,

3274
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:15,840
well it wasn't that.

3275
01:21:15,841 --> 01:21:17,370
It was just nobody tried it.

3276
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,150
Nobody knew about it.

3277
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:18,871
I didn't try and tell you,

3278
01:21:18,871 --> 01:21:20,190
I heard you on a podcast do,

3279
01:21:20,191 --> 01:21:21,720
I can't shut the fuck up about it.

3280
01:21:21,721 --> 01:21:21,930
I just,

3281
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:22,590
I love it.

3282
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:23,220
It's amazing.

3283
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:23,521
It's still,

3284
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:24,750
I mean my life is crazy.

3285
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:26,810
I'm sure everyone's life
is crazy minds insane.

3286
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,740
I have too much shit
going on all the time.

3287
01:21:28,741 --> 01:21:31,380
So it's like seriously one of the
only ways I can shut my brain off.

3288
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:34,920
It's the only time you were alone with
just your thoughts where your bodies

3289
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:35,490
aren't even there.

3290
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:39,870
So as that's the reason why I like to
take a shit cause I by myself like my

3291
01:21:39,871 --> 01:21:41,840
shit's had been like three times
longer cause I give it to him.

3292
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:43,110
I tell him like Ah yes,

3293
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:46,710
no one know what the key to taking a good
shit as though don't bring your phone.

3294
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,440
I know it's the hottest thing.

3295
01:21:48,441 --> 01:21:49,280
You bring your phone,

3296
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:53,010
you start scrolling through Instagram
looking at girls butts and fucking

3297
01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:56,610
explosions like oh where's my phone?

3298
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:57,444
I got to think of Shit.

3299
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,430
Exactly.

3300
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:02,790
My kids know I grab that phone and
I started walking to the bathroom,

3301
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:02,971
go,

3302
01:22:02,971 --> 01:22:03,220
oh,

3303
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,950
that's going to be there for a while.

3304
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:06,091
Then you too,

3305
01:22:06,091 --> 01:22:06,540
man.

3306
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,373
It's the worst.

3307
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,550
I bet a cell phones
have created the him uh,

3308
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:11,640
triple the hemorrhoids.

3309
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:11,851
Oh,

3310
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:12,684
I'm sure.

3311
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:13,171
Yeah,

3312
01:22:13,171 --> 01:22:13,890
right.

3313
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:14,191
For sure.

3314
01:22:14,191 --> 01:22:16,380
They long you sit on the toilet
now compared to what you used to.

3315
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:20,940
Eddie Bravo has very extensive theories
on creating hemorrhoids on the toilet.

3316
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:22,860
Like about what is happening to your ass.

3317
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:23,880
Ask Him.

3318
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:24,590
Oh,

3319
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:28,200
he goes into great detail
about the pressure of the bowl,

3320
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:29,910
that it's an unnatural pressure,

3321
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:33,010
like squeezing part of your ass and
this part is creative toilet seat.

3322
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:36,390
Then he created his own toilet
seat to get rid of hemorrhoids.

3323
01:22:36,391 --> 01:22:36,661
Really?

3324
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:38,220
The move is those squatty potty.

3325
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:38,700
Oh Dude.

3326
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:39,533
I have one of those.

3327
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:40,351
It's like,

3328
01:22:40,351 --> 01:22:40,621
whoa.

3329
01:22:40,621 --> 01:22:41,640
I didn't know how much in there.

3330
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:42,250
It's just,

3331
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:42,820
whew.

3332
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:43,770
He comes flying out.

3333
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,360
I seen you had a,

3334
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:46,380
is that a toto in here?

3335
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:46,981
Dude?

3336
01:22:46,981 --> 01:22:47,661
I think that makes the,

3337
01:22:47,661 --> 01:22:48,280
um,

3338
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,550
what does it Braun del Bron down?

3339
01:22:50,551 --> 01:22:51,900
I think those are the shit.

3340
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:53,940
I built the house out in Colorado
and I put one of those in my,

3341
01:22:53,941 --> 01:22:55,320
I don't want to shit anywhere else.

3342
01:22:55,321 --> 01:22:55,710
Yes,

3343
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:56,161
exactly.

3344
01:22:56,161 --> 01:22:56,401
It's like,

3345
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:58,920
do I just only want to go home and take
a shit cause that until it seats way

3346
01:22:58,921 --> 01:23:01,170
better and it's got the
day and it's awesome.

3347
01:23:01,171 --> 01:23:03,180
So do you rent your house out in Colorado?

3348
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:03,910
No.

3349
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:04,230
No.

3350
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:05,610
Just go out there and visit when you can.

3351
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:06,480
Um,

3352
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,020
kind of like a little vacation house now.

3353
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:08,201
I mean,

3354
01:23:08,201 --> 01:23:08,770
I live in,

3355
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:09,730
I live in Orange County,

3356
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:10,610
um,

3357
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:11,590
but a lot love Orange County.

3358
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:11,981
I do,

3359
01:23:11,981 --> 01:23:12,291
man.

3360
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:13,150
It's nice out there.

3361
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:15,670
I went to school down there and went
to school at cal state Fullerton.

3362
01:23:15,671 --> 01:23:19,420
So all my close friends I wrestle with
are in the same part of their life that

3363
01:23:19,421 --> 01:23:20,430
all of young kids,

3364
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:21,423
they're all,

3365
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,750
they're all in the same area.

3366
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:23,400
So it's,

3367
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,191
and not only that,

3368
01:23:24,191 --> 01:23:24,860
my family's close.

3369
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:25,810
I love Orange County.

3370
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:28,240
It's definitely been
a great change for me.

3371
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:28,481
But,

3372
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:28,670
uh,

3373
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,560
Colorado's beautiful.

3374
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:30,730
How far are you from the beach?

3375
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:31,421
Uh,

3376
01:23:31,421 --> 01:23:32,254
probably a half hour.

3377
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:33,190
That's not too bad.

3378
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:34,023
No,

3379
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:35,500
about a half hour from Huntington,

3380
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:36,843
Newport.

3381
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:37,331
So,

3382
01:23:37,331 --> 01:23:37,481
yeah,

3383
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:37,631
it's,

3384
01:23:37,631 --> 01:23:38,081
it's nice.

3385
01:23:38,081 --> 01:23:38,371
It's a,

3386
01:23:38,371 --> 01:23:38,771
it's a suit.

3387
01:23:38,771 --> 01:23:38,951
I mean,

3388
01:23:38,951 --> 01:23:40,820
Yorba Linda is like a family area too.

3389
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:42,850
It's like such a nice little cool area.

3390
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:43,631
It's very nice.

3391
01:23:43,631 --> 01:23:44,160
Yeah.

3392
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:44,291
Yeah.

3393
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:48,010
That whole area is nice in Kalvia is out
in that area to tell via lives in Yorba

3394
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:48,040
Linda.

3395
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,750
One lives in Yorba Linda.

3396
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:50,980
Cub lives in Yorba Linda,

3397
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:52,301
so we got a good little,

3398
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:53,620
like a little family started there.

3399
01:23:53,621 --> 01:23:55,900
All the guys that wrestled with
and college live in the area.

3400
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:56,451
Well,

3401
01:23:56,451 --> 01:24:00,900
it's nice to see guys from both
organizations with the UFC and bell toward

3402
01:24:00,901 --> 01:24:01,840
training together too.

3403
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:02,620
I mean,

3404
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:03,730
I've seen that with you guys.

3405
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:06,860
I mean Beltour really now is like,

3406
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:09,460
it's a major player then
they have like major,

3407
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,360
major talent.

3408
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:11,690
Absolutely.

3409
01:24:11,690 --> 01:24:12,460
Very interesting.

3410
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:12,760
Yeah.

3411
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,530
I mean they don't get as much credit.

3412
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,570
Obviously they're not those big promotion,

3413
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,640
but they have some of the best fighters,

3414
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:18,970
you know,

3415
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:19,210
they got,

3416
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:19,451
I mean,

3417
01:24:19,451 --> 01:24:20,050
look,

3418
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:21,510
they've got gay guard moved sauce,

3419
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:21,731
you know,

3420
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:23,860
like a Rory Macdonald Macdonald.

3421
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:24,311
Yeah.

3422
01:24:24,311 --> 01:24:25,420
You can go down the list.

3423
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:27,850
How about fucking Ryan Bader?

3424
01:24:27,851 --> 01:24:29,980
Keown Fitzroy that crazy.

3425
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,450
I thought Bader was going to win.

3426
01:24:31,451 --> 01:24:34,210
I thought it was going to use this
pressure and just wear on him and route

3427
01:24:34,230 --> 01:24:34,920
wrestle him.

3428
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:35,740
Um,

3429
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:36,250
but yeah,

3430
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:36,791
that's crazy.

3431
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:38,860
10 seconds while he clipped him with that.

3432
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:39,640
Crazy.

3433
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,820
It's like a level chance.

3434
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:41,291
Yeah.

3435
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:42,041
Level Change.

3436
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:42,611
Half Hook,

3437
01:24:42,611 --> 01:24:43,420
Half Jab.

3438
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:46,210
I think he was getting fade or to think
that he was in dropped for a shot and

3439
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:47,530
loop to hook over the time.

3440
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:47,890
Right.

3441
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:50,260
It seemed like he wanted
to get fade or to do that.

3442
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,400
Isn't that how I got the knockout?

3443
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:52,300
The fight before that too,

3444
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:53,020
right,

3445
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:53,450
exactly.

3446
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:54,310
Same Punch took.

3447
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:54,870
Yeah.

3448
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:56,270
It was a level change leftover.

3449
01:24:56,450 --> 01:24:56,590
You know,

3450
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:57,220
people are thinking like,

3451
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:57,521
oh shit,

3452
01:24:57,521 --> 01:24:58,420
he's coming for a takedown.

3453
01:24:58,540 --> 01:24:58,701
Well,

3454
01:24:58,701 --> 01:24:59,650
as a heavyweight man,

3455
01:24:59,651 --> 01:25:00,670
he's a motherfucker.

3456
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:01,960
He looks good,

3457
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:02,830
he looks fantastic.

3458
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:03,713
Body looks good.

3459
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:04,420
Yeah.

3460
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:05,710
I mean he looks like a heavyweight.

3461
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:06,250
Yeah.

3462
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:06,791
And you know,

3463
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:08,650
he's weighing two 35 ish,

3464
01:25:08,651 --> 01:25:09,640
somewhere around there,

3465
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:09,850
you know,

3466
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:11,650
which is a great weight for heavyweight.

3467
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:13,180
I think it's the best way
for that weight class.

3468
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,520
There's that point of diminishing returns.

3469
01:25:15,521 --> 01:25:15,790
Right?

3470
01:25:15,790 --> 01:25:17,950
You get to like two 60
unless you're in Ghana.

3471
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:18,320
Well,

3472
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:18,750
let's see,

3473
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:20,290
in Ghana who doesn't know how to wrestle,

3474
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:21,430
so that's part of the problem.

3475
01:25:21,431 --> 01:25:22,264
But,

3476
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,100
but if he did holy fuck,

3477
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:24,851
but as a,

3478
01:25:24,851 --> 01:25:25,900
as an agile,

3479
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:26,830
as you needed to beat wrestle,

3480
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:27,850
I don't know if he could move that fast.

3481
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:29,050
He can move fast.

3482
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:30,320
Muesli or cat.

3483
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:30,880
Damn.

3484
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,220
He scares the shit out of me because guy,

3485
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,120
if he knew like what everybody else knew,

3486
01:25:37,121 --> 01:25:39,250
I just think he's so physically gifted.

3487
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:39,910
Yeah.

3488
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:43,750
I mean when you see him punch people
it's like it's a different thing.

3489
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:44,770
It's different.

3490
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:45,603
Yeah.

3491
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,470
Just a lunchbox coming at your head.

3492
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,720
The power is just preposterous.

3493
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,040
It just doesn't even make any sense.

3494
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:51,640
Yeah.

3495
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:55,290
If that guy could get with a guy like
Dwayne and start moving and just,

3496
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:55,780
you know,

3497
01:25:55,780 --> 01:26:00,780
not just rely on throwing hammers but
set and stuff up and switching stances.

3498
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:03,920
I don't know if you can do
that with kind of weight,

3499
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:04,670
you know?

3500
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:07,310
How long can a guy like that move,

3501
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,001
you know,

3502
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:09,520
my brother Sam can get
him to move that along.

3503
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,910
I Jane Tease,

3504
01:26:10,911 --> 01:26:11,391
you'd say,

3505
01:26:11,391 --> 01:26:11,930
I'm like,

3506
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:12,441
I'm telling you,

3507
01:26:12,441 --> 01:26:14,450
like if I'm going like for my body mass,

3508
01:26:14,451 --> 01:26:16,760
if I'm able to walk around with
65 and the lactate threshold,

3509
01:26:16,761 --> 01:26:18,530
he's telling me I can
have a guarantee you,

3510
01:26:18,531 --> 01:26:19,760
you can do it with the big guy like that.

3511
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:20,571
Wow.

3512
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:21,500
That would be insane.

3513
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:22,221
Well,

3514
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:23,930
there's not a lot of big guys like that.

3515
01:26:23,931 --> 01:26:24,681
That's the thing too.

3516
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:26,210
It's like who does he have to train with?

3517
01:26:26,211 --> 01:26:27,140
It's going to push him.

3518
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:27,650
Yeah.

3519
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:27,990
You know,

3520
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:28,310
the I,

3521
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:30,310
that is a giant problem with heavyweights,

3522
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,930
whether it's in wrestling
or Jujitsu or anything,

3523
01:26:32,931 --> 01:26:34,820
it's finding someone that
they could train with.

3524
01:26:34,821 --> 01:26:35,654
It's that heavy.

3525
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:36,800
If it's that big,

3526
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:37,520
I mean he's,

3527
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,270
he's a legit natural 265 pound man.

3528
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:42,433
And I mean,

3529
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:42,621
well,

3530
01:26:42,621 --> 01:26:44,990
I feel like if you're getting
hit by another 265 pound man too,

3531
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:46,220
it's going to take more out of you.

3532
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:50,210
Even if you're to 65 and you're getting
hit by under the guise to 65 I still

3533
01:26:50,211 --> 01:26:52,040
feel like your head can only take so much.

3534
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,670
Oh yeah,

3535
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:53,180
yeah,

3536
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:53,511
yeah.

3537
01:26:53,511 --> 01:26:53,781
I mean,

3538
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:55,430
how much more can you take?

3539
01:26:55,431 --> 01:26:55,710
Right?

3540
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:56,420
Yeah.

3541
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:56,990
I mean this is,

3542
01:26:56,990 --> 01:26:59,180
that's the football thing that we were
talking about when we're talking about

3543
01:26:59,181 --> 01:27:00,200
Jason Harrison.

3544
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:03,800
He was alignment for
Uc Davis and you know,

3545
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:05,990
played a little bit in the
NFL was a bench warmer,

3546
01:27:05,991 --> 01:27:06,531
but you know,

3547
01:27:06,531 --> 01:27:07,760
it was training with those guys.

3548
01:27:07,761 --> 01:27:08,850
It's just that,

3549
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:13,310
that you're dealing with gigantic
huge dudes slamming anyway.

3550
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,180
Tried to like that.

3551
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:15,320
The force.

3552
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:16,903
Yeah,

3553
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:19,380
I guess you got to do more of like the
journal and what we're talking about are

3554
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:20,870
live like live drilling.

3555
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:23,960
You know where you're going with like
partners that you can trust that you're

3556
01:27:23,961 --> 01:27:25,490
going to do 50% sparring here,

3557
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,930
not to crush each other,

3558
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:29,210
but you're going to get that
reaction time kind of stuff.

3559
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,260
But then you can wrestle hard.

3560
01:27:30,261 --> 01:27:30,710
You could use your,

3561
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,760
get too hard and get that,

3562
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:33,080
that hard training that way,

3563
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:35,240
but then drill the right ways.

3564
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:36,110
Striking,

3565
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:36,620
you know?

3566
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:37,070
Yeah,

3567
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:37,610
yeah.

3568
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:38,120
Now,

3569
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:38,570
um,

3570
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:42,200
as far as your recovery stuff,

3571
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,820
did you detail everything here?

3572
01:27:43,821 --> 01:27:44,900
You've got the red light,

3573
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:48,830
you have your infrared sauna
using like one of those fits spas,

3574
01:27:48,831 --> 01:27:50,840
which would cause I think it is a fit spa.

3575
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:52,730
Is that the kind that has like a TV in it?

3576
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:53,241
No,

3577
01:27:53,241 --> 01:27:53,661
it's got,

3578
01:27:53,661 --> 01:27:57,980
it's got Bluetooth for listening to your
podcasts and he's got it's infrared.

3579
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:58,241
So it's,

3580
01:27:58,241 --> 01:27:58,461
it's,

3581
01:27:58,461 --> 01:28:00,830
it's got the red light on
and gets to 140 degrees.

3582
01:28:00,831 --> 01:28:01,310
Right.

3583
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:02,100
But uh,

3584
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:05,000
the infrared makes you sweat
from this cells inside out,

3585
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,370
which I feel is better for the recovery.

3586
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:08,001
Um,

3587
01:28:08,001 --> 01:28:09,440
I do like to super hot ones,

3588
01:28:09,441 --> 01:28:11,180
like they do something to you that like,

3589
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:12,590
um,

3590
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:14,120
it's hard to describe
when you get out of it.

3591
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:15,800
Like when it's really
hot and you feel great,

3592
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:19,220
but I feel like I get more recovery
out of the infrared throughout my body.

3593
01:28:19,221 --> 01:28:21,440
Same reason why I use the
Juve red light therapy.

3594
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:22,663
Um,

3595
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:23,983
ice baths.

3596
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:24,740
No,

3597
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:27,350
I don't do ice pass their torture.

3598
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,200
I've done the Cryo and again too,

3599
01:28:30,201 --> 01:28:31,790
I don't do that much of it.

3600
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:33,043
Um,

3601
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:34,680
I think mainly I needed to get,

3602
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:36,170
I get my recovery from,

3603
01:28:36,171 --> 01:28:37,004
uh,

3604
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:37,910
taking the days off.

3605
01:28:37,911 --> 01:28:39,710
I need to most of my recovery,

3606
01:28:39,711 --> 01:28:40,280
like a,

3607
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:40,880
I take,

3608
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,120
I take more days off now working with
Sam than I've ever taken in my past.

3609
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,433
Um,

3610
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,440
when I was working with Dwayne
out in Colorado or at Alpha Male,

3611
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:49,611
I would just go,

3612
01:28:49,611 --> 01:28:49,851
go,

3613
01:28:49,851 --> 01:28:50,091
go,

3614
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:50,331
go,

3615
01:28:50,331 --> 01:28:50,571
go,

3616
01:28:50,571 --> 01:28:50,781
go,

3617
01:28:50,781 --> 01:28:50,991
go.

3618
01:28:50,991 --> 01:28:52,730
I thought working more was interviewed me,

3619
01:28:52,731 --> 01:28:53,560
they're better.

3620
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,090
And that's probably why your testosterone
was dropping a hundred percent.

3621
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,240
I was red land in myself and so I
take more days off now with Sam,

3622
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:02,280
but the days that I'm not
taking off for a lot harder,

3623
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:03,060
um,

3624
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,740
just knowing when to cycle those days off,

3625
01:29:04,741 --> 01:29:06,870
like you have to rest and I hate my sleep.

3626
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:07,993
Um,

3627
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:09,150
I have a one year old,

3628
01:29:09,151 --> 01:29:12,600
so I created a guest room that I'll sleep
in during camp cause I got to get my

3629
01:29:12,601 --> 01:29:13,440
nine hours of sleep.

3630
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:14,843
Um,

3631
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:16,950
and know what days I gotta take off.

3632
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:17,660
Um,

3633
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:18,420
and uh,

3634
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,160
those days will be off
from training completely.

3635
01:29:20,161 --> 01:29:22,500
I'll try to like go take my son on a walk,

3636
01:29:22,501 --> 01:29:23,700
go hang out with my family.

3637
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:24,330
Um,

3638
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:25,560
obviously I got less of that,

3639
01:29:25,561 --> 01:29:27,290
this camp because I'm going 20 fives.

3640
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,260
It took a lot more work.

3641
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:29,130
Um,

3642
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,960
but it's making sure
to take those days off.

3643
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:32,070
What about massage?

3644
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:32,850
Yes.

3645
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:33,061
Yeah,

3646
01:29:33,061 --> 01:29:33,690
absolutely.

3647
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:34,650
How often do you do that?

3648
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,000
As much as I can.

3649
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:36,361
I mean,

3650
01:29:36,361 --> 01:29:36,990
I'll do it.

3651
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:37,171
I mean,

3652
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:39,210
I don't think you can do too much of
it as long as you've got someone that's

3653
01:29:39,211 --> 01:29:40,044
knowledgeable,

3654
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:40,913
um,

3655
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:42,150
massage big time.

3656
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:45,630
Some were you connect and I said another
way to really relax and shut the brain

3657
01:29:45,631 --> 01:29:46,130
off to.

3658
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:46,963
Yeah.

3659
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:47,790
Um,

3660
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:49,440
anything to get my really,

3661
01:29:49,441 --> 01:29:51,870
your recovery needs to be
dropping your cortisol levels.

3662
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:53,640
If you could drop your cortisol levels,

3663
01:29:53,641 --> 01:29:56,010
everything else is going
to go the way it should go.

3664
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:56,880
Um,

3665
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,490
which is another thing I test throughout
my campus and my cortisol levels.

3666
01:29:59,491 --> 01:29:59,671
You know,

3667
01:29:59,671 --> 01:30:03,270
maybe I'm doing too much
outside of training,

3668
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:07,770
like too much a sponsorship stuff
or my fit to fight program or old.

3669
01:30:07,771 --> 01:30:08,581
My other businesses,

3670
01:30:08,581 --> 01:30:11,130
my flavor republic by
the way is excellent.

3671
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:11,730
Uh,

3672
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:12,900
tell people about this stuff.

3673
01:30:12,901 --> 01:30:14,100
This stuff is really good.

3674
01:30:14,101 --> 01:30:15,900
You said a while back.

3675
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:16,170
Yeah.

3676
01:30:16,170 --> 01:30:17,430
Got some great rubs.

3677
01:30:17,431 --> 01:30:18,990
This is a honey garlic.

3678
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,700
It's all healthy stuff.

3679
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,620
It's called flavor of public.

3680
01:30:22,621 --> 01:30:23,221
This is not,

3681
01:30:23,221 --> 01:30:23,371
I mean,

3682
01:30:23,371 --> 01:30:24,360
this is a plug folks,

3683
01:30:24,361 --> 01:30:25,500
but I'm not getting paid for this.

3684
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:26,670
I just love,

3685
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:27,210
I love it.

3686
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:27,690
Yeah.

3687
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:28,081
Thank you.

3688
01:30:28,081 --> 01:30:28,621
Great stuff,

3689
01:30:28,621 --> 01:30:28,970
man.

3690
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:30,390
When I got into it,

3691
01:30:30,391 --> 01:30:31,270
because I met a,

3692
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:32,203
um,

3693
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:33,061
a Jujitsu guy,

3694
01:30:33,061 --> 01:30:33,481
he's really,

3695
01:30:33,481 --> 01:30:34,440
his name's Kenny tinny.

3696
01:30:34,441 --> 01:30:35,700
He's really big into Jujitsu.

3697
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:38,430
He was taking Propecia
and it messed up his,

3698
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:39,161
on one level.

3699
01:30:39,161 --> 01:30:41,340
We're talking about this before
the show did the same thing to me.

3700
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:41,641
Yeah.

3701
01:30:41,641 --> 01:30:42,930
It messed up his testosterone levels.

3702
01:30:42,931 --> 01:30:45,660
So he had to get into his diet to kind
of recurve what he had going on because

3703
01:30:45,661 --> 01:30:47,440
he was taking insane,

3704
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:51,000
insane amounts of therapeutic level
of testosterone to get his body back.

3705
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:51,631
Um,

3706
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:53,440
and so he wanted to get
his diet on point to,

3707
01:30:53,441 --> 01:30:55,110
so we wouldn't have to take as much test.

3708
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:55,711
Um,

3709
01:30:55,711 --> 01:30:57,870
and as well as I teamed up
with just an average Joe.

3710
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:02,190
He's just a guy that wants to get
into fitness and wants to be healthy,

3711
01:31:02,191 --> 01:31:03,150
but us three,

3712
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:07,920
we created this because I got into my
diet so much because I'm not eating any

3713
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:08,754
sugars.

3714
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:09,750
I don't go complex.

3715
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:14,220
I'm pretty much going like Paleo Keto and
saw and every time I wanted to do meal

3716
01:31:14,221 --> 01:31:15,960
prep or Sam wanted to do meal prep,

3717
01:31:15,961 --> 01:31:18,960
we couldn't use spices and seasonings
because if you look on the shelf,

3718
01:31:18,961 --> 01:31:22,050
they have like 14 grams of
sugar and a bunch of tables.

3719
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:23,610
We were talking about trigger.

3720
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:27,660
I love triggers grills and I love the
rubs and their barbecue sauces and

3721
01:31:27,661 --> 01:31:28,590
everything so good.

3722
01:31:28,591 --> 01:31:30,870
But there's some fucking
sugar in that shit.

3723
01:31:30,871 --> 01:31:32,610
A lot of so Delecia.

3724
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:33,450
Exactly.

3725
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:37,740
And so we created this so that we could
do our meal prep and still be healthy.

3726
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,190
You know an espresso rug that's
really good on your a wild game.

3727
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:41,900
Yeah.

3728
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:42,150
Yeah.

3729
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:42,451
It's really,

3730
01:31:42,451 --> 01:31:42,611
it's,

3731
01:31:42,611 --> 01:31:43,441
it's like a,

3732
01:31:43,441 --> 01:31:44,420
it's like a peppery kick.

3733
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:47,370
That one doesn't sell very well because
I think it's called Espresso Rub.

3734
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:48,381
People don't realize,

3735
01:31:48,381 --> 01:31:49,214
understand it.

3736
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,140
Espresso blend.

3737
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:52,950
So it doesn't need to change
like a Colombian something,

3738
01:31:52,951 --> 01:31:53,281
you know,

3739
01:31:53,281 --> 01:31:54,000
like,

3740
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,080
cause they're like coffee.

3741
01:31:55,081 --> 01:31:55,914
I don't think that's it.

3742
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,160
I don't know man.

3743
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,190
We were talking about with
Ben Greenfield yesterday,

3744
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:00,700
coffee rubs are fantastic.

3745
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:01,150
Awesome.

3746
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:06,150
He was saying that coffee actually reduces
the amount of carcinogens on cooked

3747
01:32:06,311 --> 01:32:06,670
meat.

3748
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:07,090
Oh really?

3749
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:07,370
Yeah,

3750
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:11,230
like having it on the outside that it
acts as an antioxidant and reduces the

3751
01:32:11,231 --> 01:32:12,080
amount of carcinogens.

3752
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:13,620
First Time I tried it was a,

3753
01:32:13,650 --> 01:32:14,020
um,

3754
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:14,890
a piece of meat.

3755
01:32:14,891 --> 01:32:17,390
I got whole foods and it
had an espresso rub on it.

3756
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:18,680
Amazing.

3757
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:21,640
So like we need to make that like I'm
telling you like all the wild game I have,

3758
01:32:21,641 --> 01:32:23,440
like it takes away any
of the Gamey flavor.

3759
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,460
Let's get that.

3760
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:26,350
It doesn't sell as well because
people don't understand,

3761
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,213
but it's really good.

3762
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:29,140
Are you getting any hunting in?

3763
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:30,003
Do you have any time?

3764
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:32,290
I did this year and nothing successful.

3765
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:32,800
Um,

3766
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,720
after my Cody fight in August,

3767
01:32:34,721 --> 01:32:38,380
I went out in the middle of nowhere
in Colorado by this park and hunted by

3768
01:32:38,381 --> 01:32:39,214
myself.

3769
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,790
I did like a nice getaway.

3770
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:41,250
Huh?

3771
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,071
Duty with my phone.

3772
01:32:42,071 --> 01:32:42,640
Didn't work.

3773
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,100
No one can text me holding me.

3774
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:47,740
I slept out in the middle of the
wilderness by myself under the stars.

3775
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:48,911
Kind of freaky.

3776
01:32:48,911 --> 01:32:49,870
I've never done that before,

3777
01:32:49,871 --> 01:32:50,650
you know.

3778
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:51,040
Um,

3779
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,750
but I endorse him was
telling me about that,

3780
01:32:52,751 --> 01:32:53,321
that it was like,

3781
01:32:53,321 --> 01:32:54,154
you gotta do it.

3782
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:54,611
It's like,

3783
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:56,080
it's one of the best
things I've ever done.

3784
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:58,870
I like hunting with people cause you
get to get like really to know them.

3785
01:32:58,900 --> 01:32:59,171
Right.

3786
01:32:59,171 --> 01:32:59,351
Like,

3787
01:32:59,351 --> 01:32:59,570
you know,

3788
01:32:59,570 --> 01:33:00,280
sit around the campfire,

3789
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,440
everyone and it splits up to go
hunt and you talk about your day,

3790
01:33:02,441 --> 01:33:03,730
you get back to the campfire and you,

3791
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:05,380
you really get to know each other.

3792
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:07,540
And I go with my brothers
and my dad all the time.

3793
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:08,980
We use one of my favorite
things about hunting.

3794
01:33:08,981 --> 01:33:10,420
It's the best it really is.

3795
01:33:10,421 --> 01:33:12,910
And you were like really get to tell
stories and get to know each other.

3796
01:33:12,911 --> 01:33:13,331
It's awesome.

3797
01:33:13,331 --> 01:33:16,540
But I went by myself for the first time
this year and that was an experience as

3798
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:16,901
well too.

3799
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:21,040
Like you got like just the hunting on
and doing it like the wilderness by

3800
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:21,581
yourself.

3801
01:33:21,581 --> 01:33:23,950
Like making sure you
don't get lost three days.

3802
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:25,210
So did you backpack in?

3803
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:25,501
Yeah.

3804
01:33:25,501 --> 01:33:25,901
Oh No,

3805
01:33:25,901 --> 01:33:26,740
I got to drive in.

3806
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:27,690
It wasn't,

3807
01:33:27,690 --> 01:33:28,730
so I went to a trailhead.

3808
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:29,170
Yep.

3809
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:30,730
And how much you carry on when your back?

3810
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:32,020
Uh,

3811
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:33,490
probably like 40,

3812
01:33:33,491 --> 01:33:34,324
50 pounds.

3813
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,600
So you got like a day pack and like,

3814
01:33:36,601 --> 01:33:36,770
yeah,

3815
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:37,603
I got that.

3816
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:38,530
Um,

3817
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:39,820
and then I'll just hike back in.

3818
01:33:39,821 --> 01:33:40,654
And you have a bow?

3819
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:41,310
My bow.

3820
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:41,770
Yeah.

3821
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:42,280
I,

3822
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,780
I really only liked to hunt with my bow.

3823
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:45,430
I will do some rifle.

3824
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:45,881
Oh,

3825
01:33:45,881 --> 01:33:47,080
just when the opportunity comes.

3826
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:49,120
But you have time to practice with my bow.

3827
01:33:49,121 --> 01:33:49,600
I do,

3828
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,150
yeah.

3829
01:33:50,150 --> 01:33:50,860
Yeah.

3830
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:52,690
It's kind of another
escape for me as well too.

3831
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:53,770
Like another way,

3832
01:33:53,771 --> 01:33:54,760
like maybe my off day,

3833
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:57,220
like my days it co coach
tells me to take a day off.

3834
01:33:57,490 --> 01:34:01,210
Maybe I'll go shoot my bow or from in
Colorado I would take my boat out or go

3835
01:34:01,211 --> 01:34:02,044
fishing,

3836
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:02,741
things like that.

3837
01:34:02,741 --> 01:34:04,180
So that's one of my hobbies.

3838
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:06,300
Like even if I'm not getting
ready for hunting season,

3839
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:07,660
I'll just shoot just to shoot.

3840
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:09,670
Next time you come here you've
got to play techno hunt.

3841
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:12,250
Is this the one out here in front
of you haven't seen that yet,

3842
01:34:12,251 --> 01:34:12,460
Huh?

3843
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:12,701
I've,

3844
01:34:12,701 --> 01:34:13,391
I've played it.

3845
01:34:13,391 --> 01:34:15,310
I've played it at an
archery shop in Colorado.

3846
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:16,300
It's like a three d hunting.

3847
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:18,100
It's a video game pretty much.

3848
01:34:18,101 --> 01:34:19,970
And you shoot like these
magnets at the screen.

3849
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:20,111
Well,

3850
01:34:20,111 --> 01:34:20,831
it's not a magnet.

3851
01:34:20,831 --> 01:34:22,950
It's just a flat broadhead.

3852
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,520
It's flat like a ahead of a nail.

3853
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:24,661
Yeah,

3854
01:34:24,661 --> 01:34:25,150
it's cool.

3855
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:26,380
And it's a Kevlar screen.

3856
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:27,790
It's very realistic too.

3857
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:31,600
It gives you a score if you get like a
vital shot or if you wound the animal.

3858
01:34:31,601 --> 01:34:32,081
Exactly.

3859
01:34:32,081 --> 01:34:32,830
That's cool.

3860
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:33,250
Yeah,

3861
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:33,611
for sure.

3862
01:34:33,611 --> 01:34:34,720
I'll have to bring my boat next time.

3863
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:35,740
It's super addictive.

3864
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:36,101
I mean,

3865
01:34:36,101 --> 01:34:37,540
you've got the fantasy factory here,

3866
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,231
you know what I mean?

3867
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:40,270
Like I don't even know if I'd
go home if I had this place.

3868
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:43,240
Now I've got a bunch of
stuff here for my kids.

3869
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:43,721
Oh really?

3870
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:44,231
So yeah.

3871
01:34:44,231 --> 01:34:44,570
It's like,

3872
01:34:44,570 --> 01:34:46,160
do you see that inflatable
thing out their mouth?

3873
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:48,730
That was just a judge.

3874
01:34:48,731 --> 01:34:49,780
How far you're shooting for now?

3875
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:51,280
No,

3876
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,050
that's bouncing things off.

3877
01:34:53,051 --> 01:34:53,950
Filled up with air.

3878
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:57,410
My a 10 year old comes in here and
does fucking backflips and show with a

3879
01:34:57,411 --> 01:34:58,280
concrete around it.

3880
01:34:58,281 --> 01:34:59,380
She's a fucking freak.

3881
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:00,290
Really doesn't care.

3882
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:01,400
I'd be scared of Shit.

3883
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:02,330
This is like,

3884
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:04,310
it's like not very why he got to let them,

3885
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:05,850
you gotta let them do wild shit.

3886
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:08,390
Well there's the mats out
there to the Jujitsu match.

3887
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:09,410
She does him on that too.

3888
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:09,860
Okay.

3889
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:10,790
It shows gymnastics.

3890
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:11,330
Yeah.

3891
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:12,260
That's hard on your body.

3892
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:12,830
It is.

3893
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:13,330
Yeah.

3894
01:35:13,330 --> 01:35:13,760
I have,

3895
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:14,461
when I wrestled the,

3896
01:35:14,461 --> 01:35:17,390
we had a gymnastics team and they
were always in the physical therapy.

3897
01:35:17,391 --> 01:35:18,680
They were always hurt their backs,

3898
01:35:18,681 --> 01:35:19,300
their any case.

3899
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:23,180
So I think 10 year olds it's like first
of all I just see the shit she does like

3900
01:35:23,181 --> 01:35:27,680
she could stand here and take our
hands and touch the back of her ankles.

3901
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:31,820
She has bends all the way back and it's
like well how the fuck your body even

3902
01:35:31,821 --> 01:35:32,690
work that way.

3903
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:37,970
I look at this 51 year old fucked up body
of mine from all the years of beating

3904
01:35:37,971 --> 01:35:38,840
on it and it's like,

3905
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:40,081
but all the,

3906
01:35:40,081 --> 01:35:42,140
all the weightlifting you do
is make you stiff for too,

3907
01:35:42,141 --> 01:35:42,741
I mean all the years,

3908
01:35:42,741 --> 01:35:44,750
the door not knowing what I was doing,

3909
01:35:44,751 --> 01:35:47,330
just lifted me head style
and then just get like,

3910
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:50,840
like right now I'm training with Sam
and we're going heavy just to keep my

3911
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:51,140
weight.

3912
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:51,680
We don't know.

3913
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,890
I don't know if we're going 35 I
don't know if I'm going on 25 45 or,

3914
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:55,400
yeah,

3915
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:58,700
I'm just keeping my weight where it
needs to be and getting a lot stronger.

3916
01:35:58,701 --> 01:35:59,361
So he's telling me like,

3917
01:35:59,361 --> 01:36:00,350
we're adding all this muscle,

3918
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,640
make sure you're doing your yoga.

3919
01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:02,320
And that's,

3920
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,440
that's why I've been doing that as well.

3921
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:05,750
The other thing I wanted to talk
to you about outside of Yoga,

3922
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:06,890
are you doing stretching?

3923
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:07,783
Yes.

3924
01:36:07,810 --> 01:36:07,980
Yeah.

3925
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:10,850
How often do you guys trunk
who I stretched before every,

3926
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:14,870
I do a dynamic stretch before every
practice before practice is interesting

3927
01:36:14,871 --> 01:36:15,770
because most people don't,

3928
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:16,663
don't,

3929
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:19,160
we'll statics that don't do stat.

3930
01:36:19,161 --> 01:36:21,160
I don't like doing static
stretching before I work out.

3931
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:22,011
That dynamic.

3932
01:36:22,011 --> 01:36:23,520
You're constantly moving
while you're stretching?

3933
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:23,950
Yes.

3934
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:25,170
It's something I've learned from Lauren.

3935
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:28,820
Then out in Colorado and something I've
added to my fit to fight program as I go

3936
01:36:28,821 --> 01:36:31,550
through like a whole dynamic warmup
that I do before every practice.

3937
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,050
It's like a walking series,

3938
01:36:33,051 --> 01:36:33,231
you know,

3939
01:36:33,231 --> 01:36:34,340
like a walking knee hug,

3940
01:36:34,341 --> 01:36:34,970
a walking home,

3941
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:37,950
quad pole inchworms like things like that.

3942
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,520
And like a quadro pet series.

3943
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:40,610
It'll keep my hips loose,

3944
01:36:40,611 --> 01:36:41,444
things like that.

3945
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,820
I'll do that before every practice.

3946
01:36:44,050 --> 01:36:44,510
Um,

3947
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:46,460
but then at the end of practice
you do a little bit of a,

3948
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:48,290
I don't do as much static stretching.

3949
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,320
I do more dynamic kind of
like in movement stretching,

3950
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:51,591
you know,

3951
01:36:51,591 --> 01:36:52,424
same thing as like,

3952
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:53,960
I mean I get more flexible.

3953
01:36:53,961 --> 01:36:57,830
I got so much more flexible when I started
kickboxing just from that throwing a

3954
01:36:57,831 --> 01:36:58,290
head kick,

3955
01:36:58,290 --> 01:37:00,350
throwing a head kick and just
opening your hips all the time.

3956
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:03,080
But before I throw a bunch of head kicks,

3957
01:37:03,081 --> 01:37:06,980
I needed to do my quadro series to
not mess my hip flexors up or my my,

3958
01:37:06,981 --> 01:37:08,540
so as we'll get tight as shit,

3959
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:08,841
you know,

3960
01:37:08,841 --> 01:37:09,441
some more of those.

3961
01:37:09,441 --> 01:37:10,280
So rights.

3962
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:10,911
Do you have one of the,

3963
01:37:10,911 --> 01:37:12,830
I heard Chandler talking
about that one for you.

3964
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:13,270
Yeah,

3965
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:16,800
I've got a gang of them really as a
sponsor so they can be a bunch of them is

3966
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:18,560
the shit and you lay on it,

3967
01:37:18,561 --> 01:37:18,771
right?

3968
01:37:18,771 --> 01:37:18,981
Yeah.

3969
01:37:18,981 --> 01:37:20,030
You can do all kinds of things.

3970
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:21,070
It hurts.

3971
01:37:21,070 --> 01:37:21,380
Yeah.

3972
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:21,971
Fuck yeah,

3973
01:37:21,971 --> 01:37:22,790
it hurts.

3974
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:23,441
But it works.

3975
01:37:23,441 --> 01:37:23,841
Cause I had a,

3976
01:37:23,841 --> 01:37:26,570
silver has messed up for one of my
fights before my Joe Soto fight,

3977
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:28,340
I couldn't throw a kick.

3978
01:37:28,341 --> 01:37:31,460
So two weeks before the
fight I couldn't throw kicks.

3979
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:31,791
I was like,

3980
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:32,421
fuck man.

3981
01:37:32,421 --> 01:37:32,871
Like my bad.

3982
01:37:32,871 --> 01:37:33,740
I thought it was my back.

3983
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,180
My lower back was toast.

3984
01:37:35,181 --> 01:37:35,630
I was like,

3985
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:38,090
I had a massage therapist working
on my backwards on my back.

3986
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:39,260
And then finally I got some,

3987
01:37:39,261 --> 01:37:39,501
I was like,

3988
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:39,831
no dude,

3989
01:37:39,831 --> 01:37:40,760
it's your so as,

3990
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:42,680
and they started digging in my soul as,

3991
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:44,170
and it was so freaking painful.

3992
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:45,021
Chandler brought it up.

3993
01:37:45,021 --> 01:37:46,190
I didn't even know it was a muscle.

3994
01:37:46,191 --> 01:37:47,540
I don't even know what the fuck that was.

3995
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:48,320
Dude.

3996
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,470
It's a motherfucker to get that work
done on David Goggins had it was an issue

3997
01:37:51,471 --> 01:37:52,071
with it as well.

3998
01:37:52,071 --> 01:37:53,180
It was keeping him from running.

3999
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:53,920
Okay.

4000
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,280
Yeah.

4001
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:54,660
Yeah.

4002
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:56,160
I mean it messes up your whole core.

4003
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:56,431
Yeah.

4004
01:37:56,431 --> 01:37:58,410
But this is simple plastic device.

4005
01:37:58,770 --> 01:37:59,041
You know,

4006
01:37:59,041 --> 01:37:59,640
you lay on it.

4007
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,200
They send me a box of a man.

4008
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:02,040
I see it,

4009
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,470
I see it on my Instagram and all
the time it's the sponsored ad.

4010
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:05,491
And I always like,

4011
01:38:05,491 --> 01:38:06,720
cause he's Chandler talking about it.

4012
01:38:06,721 --> 01:38:06,950
Yeah.

4013
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:07,501
So I was curious.

4014
01:38:07,501 --> 01:38:09,240
Chandler's really into
his body and work it out.

4015
01:38:09,241 --> 01:38:11,340
He's got his own workout
program and stuff too.

4016
01:38:11,341 --> 01:38:13,590
So his Instagram page is good to follow.

4017
01:38:13,591 --> 01:38:13,981
It is.

4018
01:38:13,981 --> 01:38:16,340
He's a fucking freak and he
looks like a bodybuilding.

4019
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:16,720
Yeah.

4020
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:16,920
Yeah.

4021
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,150
He's a freak athlete too.

4022
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:18,880
I mean he's doing,

4023
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,170
he's does these a medicine
ball backflips oh yeah.

4024
01:38:22,171 --> 01:38:22,801
Have you seen those?

4025
01:38:22,801 --> 01:38:23,101
Yes.

4026
01:38:23,101 --> 01:38:23,310
Yeah.

4027
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:25,860
He's an athlete and flips
slam the medicine ball.

4028
01:38:25,861 --> 01:38:27,510
Backflips slammed the medicine ball.

4029
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:27,820
Yes.

4030
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:28,860
Jesus Christ.

4031
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,120
He's a killer man.

4032
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:30,751
He's another one.

4033
01:38:30,751 --> 01:38:32,650
That Bella tour fucking Stud.

4034
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:33,060
Yep.

4035
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:33,241
I mean,

4036
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:35,730
he's one of the best 155
pounders on the planet.

4037
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:36,690
No doubt about it.

4038
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:37,440
100%.

4039
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,101
I agree with that.

4040
01:38:38,101 --> 01:38:39,210
Just to going to change the name.

4041
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,140
Yeah.

4042
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:40,711
Scott Coker.

4043
01:38:40,711 --> 01:38:41,130
I love you,

4044
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:42,720
but the name is wack.

4045
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:43,500
Yeah.

4046
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:44,101
Bella tour.

4047
01:38:44,101 --> 01:38:44,340
What?

4048
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:45,173
Isabella?

4049
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:46,013
I have no idea.

4050
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:46,921
I have no idea,

4051
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:47,320
but I'm,

4052
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:49,600
I feel like you can kind of feel the
difference in their promotion when you go

4053
01:38:49,601 --> 01:38:50,580
and they're getting bigger and bigger.

4054
01:38:50,581 --> 01:38:51,414
Right.

4055
01:38:51,610 --> 01:38:53,850
But you can feel a difference
when you're there of course.

4056
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,410
But you see the talent
that's in then you're like,

4057
01:38:55,411 --> 01:38:55,951
oh shit.

4058
01:38:55,951 --> 01:38:56,230
You know,

4059
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:57,450
they got goldy over there now.

4060
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:58,071
I miss gold,

4061
01:38:58,071 --> 01:38:58,301
gold.

4062
01:38:58,301 --> 01:38:59,220
These shout out to my man.

4063
01:38:59,221 --> 01:39:00,120
I saw him when I was there.

4064
01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:00,983
He's always,

4065
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:03,480
always puts a smile on his energy.

4066
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:04,853
I miss him.

4067
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:06,030
I love Jon Anik too though.

4068
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:07,590
And um,

4069
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:08,040
you know,

4070
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:11,460
I just think they just don't
have the funds that the UFC has.

4071
01:39:11,461 --> 01:39:11,790
Yeah.

4072
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:12,211
It's just,

4073
01:39:12,211 --> 01:39:17,160
they don't have the deep pockets or the
UFC and the UFC has been around for so

4074
01:39:17,161 --> 01:39:17,820
long.

4075
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:18,660
They just know how to do it.

4076
01:39:18,670 --> 01:39:19,590
They just made the right moves.

4077
01:39:19,591 --> 01:39:19,770
I mean,

4078
01:39:19,770 --> 01:39:19,921
look,

4079
01:39:19,921 --> 01:39:20,880
there were the ESPN man,

4080
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:21,671
that's so crazy.

4081
01:39:21,671 --> 01:39:22,411
It's amazing.

4082
01:39:22,411 --> 01:39:23,910
I'm so awesome.

4083
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:24,691
When that was signed,

4084
01:39:24,691 --> 01:39:25,990
I was so pumped just to see,

4085
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:29,120
think what is going to be in five
years when they're famers with ESPN,

4086
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:31,760
like how much we're going to be
on TV and the shows they're doing.

4087
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:32,750
They're doing this thing to that.

4088
01:39:32,751 --> 01:39:33,584
It's like a,

4089
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:36,120
not only are they going to fall to
winter around after their fight,

4090
01:39:36,121 --> 01:39:37,590
they're also gonna
follow the loser around.

4091
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:38,550
Well,

4092
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:39,570
to get into your life.

4093
01:39:40,490 --> 01:39:40,680
I mean,

4094
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:40,861
yeah,

4095
01:39:40,861 --> 01:39:41,770
it's going to fucking suck.

4096
01:39:41,771 --> 01:39:41,871
Hey,

4097
01:39:41,871 --> 01:39:42,331
can you think about it?

4098
01:39:42,331 --> 01:39:42,750
It's like,

4099
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:44,310
I don't want a camera follow me around.

4100
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:44,880
I froze,

4101
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,160
but they want to see how
it affects your life.

4102
01:39:47,161 --> 01:39:47,430
Like,

4103
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:47,761
like me,

4104
01:39:47,761 --> 01:39:48,480
I've been,

4105
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,310
I mean obviously I've been
pretty pissed off about it,

4106
01:39:50,311 --> 01:39:50,680
you know?

4107
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,320
Right.

4108
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:51,990
Like me,

4109
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:54,060
if I wasn't staying busy with
my businesses and my family,

4110
01:39:54,061 --> 01:39:55,240
like I would lose my mind.

4111
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:55,600
Like,

4112
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,790
I would like to see that,

4113
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:59,430
like say Brian or tig after
he fought Max Holloway,

4114
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:02,860
he goes into that fight looking
on beatable and gets just,

4115
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:04,440
just touched up,

4116
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:04,861
you know,

4117
01:40:04,861 --> 01:40:06,420
Max Holloway just touched him up.

4118
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:10,680
We really got to see who the fuck Max
Holloway is after that fight and his

4119
01:40:10,681 --> 01:40:13,980
distance control pace is output.

4120
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:14,611
Everything.

4121
01:40:14,611 --> 01:40:16,020
He's just a champion.

4122
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,120
He's just a fucking champion.

4123
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:19,013
His mindset,

4124
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:20,430
he's just a champion.

4125
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:21,563
Gangsters,

4126
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:22,141
gangsters.

4127
01:40:22,141 --> 01:40:22,591
They come in.

4128
01:40:22,591 --> 01:40:23,041
I love it.

4129
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:26,700
He's so gangs or tag is as tough as they
come to him and he just wasn't ready

4130
01:40:26,701 --> 01:40:27,534
for that yet.

4131
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:28,131
It was,

4132
01:40:28,131 --> 01:40:29,010
I think he will be man.

4133
01:40:29,011 --> 01:40:30,270
Like he's like,

4134
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:31,471
you seem like that.

4135
01:40:31,471 --> 01:40:33,000
Like I have a camera
phone around after loss.

4136
01:40:33,001 --> 01:40:34,740
Like I think he's looking
for new things now too.

4137
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:36,240
Like that's what I mean.

4138
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:39,240
If you're a free guy that takes a loss
and you don't branch out to do new

4139
01:40:39,241 --> 01:40:40,020
things,

4140
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:41,040
you're never going to get better.

4141
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:41,311
Well,

4142
01:40:41,311 --> 01:40:43,440
his Jujitsu is off the charts.

4143
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:45,720
When he grabbed a hold of co cubs neck.

4144
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:48,180
When he got the Doris at the
end of the first round was like,

4145
01:40:48,181 --> 01:40:48,781
Holy Shit,

4146
01:40:48,781 --> 01:40:49,614
it's over.

4147
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:50,280
But the,

4148
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,440
the bell rang and he got out of it.

4149
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:55,140
But then the around when he jumped
on him and grabbed that guillotine,

4150
01:40:55,210 --> 01:40:56,470
he went over the top of him.

4151
01:40:56,471 --> 01:40:59,650
Like whether it's standing up in a clinch
and got it and then came down on it

4152
01:40:59,651 --> 01:41:00,820
and then had it in the air.

4153
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:01,743
It's nasty.

4154
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:06,520
His technique is so fucking sharp
and he could do that with everything.

4155
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:09,910
I mean armbars trying to get
like a good squeeze cardio too.

4156
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:10,803
Oh yeah.

4157
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:11,741
Well you know what,

4158
01:41:11,741 --> 01:41:12,574
he's,

4159
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:15,150
he's real legacy Jujitsu.

4160
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:16,270
He comes from,

4161
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:20,560
you know that Henner and here
on camp and you know from,

4162
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,190
that's Horian school
and were hoist was from,

4163
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:25,540
that's the torrents crew.

4164
01:41:25,541 --> 01:41:26,374
I mean that's,

4165
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:28,720
that's right from the fucking motherland.

4166
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:29,440
But that is,

4167
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:29,950
and you know,

4168
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:34,870
there's a term that some people get
offended by that term is basic Jujitsu.

4169
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:36,990
I'm not offended by
that at all because the,

4170
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:39,820
some of the very best guys of all time,

4171
01:41:39,821 --> 01:41:43,060
whether it's hodge or Gracie or Hixon,

4172
01:41:43,330 --> 01:41:46,270
you don't see them doing like weird stuff.

4173
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:48,130
It's all very standard.

4174
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:48,940
It's not,

4175
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:49,121
I mean,

4176
01:41:49,121 --> 01:41:50,290
there's basic striking.

4177
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:50,870
Yeah.

4178
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:51,920
Max Holloway beat or take it.

4179
01:41:51,921 --> 01:41:53,470
He was basic striking to beat him.

4180
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:55,191
Yeah.

4181
01:41:55,191 --> 01:41:55,481
Yeah.

4182
01:41:55,481 --> 01:41:56,314
You know what I mean?

4183
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:58,330
Basics win national titles and wrestling,

4184
01:41:58,360 --> 01:41:59,680
100% a high crotch,

4185
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:00,610
100% you know,

4186
01:42:00,611 --> 01:42:01,990
a sprawling stand behind,

4187
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:03,730
but it's the level of the basics,

4188
01:42:03,731 --> 01:42:05,860
and this is what I was gonna
say about Max Hallways Jujitsu.

4189
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:08,140
It's like the level of his basics.

4190
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:08,980
He's just,

4191
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:11,650
it's so fucking polished.

4192
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:12,970
It's like as a,

4193
01:42:12,971 --> 01:42:14,770
as a person who loves martial arts,

4194
01:42:14,771 --> 01:42:15,071
for me,

4195
01:42:15,071 --> 01:42:17,020
when I see someone who's
technique is that sharp,

4196
01:42:17,021 --> 01:42:17,420
I'm like,

4197
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:18,190
whoa.

4198
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:19,690
That's what I want to tell people.

4199
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:21,760
This is why I get frustrated.

4200
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:24,580
When I see people that are on their
back and they're in the open garden,

4201
01:42:24,581 --> 01:42:25,210
there are,

4202
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:28,780
their legs are just kind of sitting
there flailing away and the guy's got his

4203
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:30,010
arms on the ground.

4204
01:42:30,011 --> 01:42:30,311
I'm like,

4205
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:31,390
Jesus Christ,

4206
01:42:31,391 --> 01:42:31,571
he's,

4207
01:42:31,571 --> 01:42:32,161
he's giving,

4208
01:42:32,161 --> 01:42:33,190
giving it to them bars.

4209
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:35,830
He's giving you all my plots
as he's giving you a sweep.

4210
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:39,640
He's setting himself up and
people don't know what to do.

4211
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:40,211
That's one thing.

4212
01:42:40,211 --> 01:42:41,750
I've added a lot to my game lately.

4213
01:42:41,751 --> 01:42:45,490
He's been at Gracie bow a flip it and
Monica is my Jujitsu and I haven't got a

4214
01:42:45,491 --> 01:42:46,150
chance to show you.

4215
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:48,040
I've been talking about it
and like the Cody fights,

4216
01:42:48,041 --> 01:42:50,020
but obviously those were
ended up on their feet.

4217
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,700
This one I didn't get a chance to show it.

4218
01:42:51,701 --> 01:42:53,920
I was hoping we were going to go to
the ground like I want out wrestle,

4219
01:42:53,921 --> 01:42:54,360
pseudo,

4220
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:55,193
you know,

4221
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:56,230
I felt strong.

4222
01:42:56,231 --> 01:42:56,691
I felt good.

4223
01:42:56,691 --> 01:42:56,791
My,

4224
01:42:56,791 --> 01:42:57,850
I was working with Darryl Christian,

4225
01:42:57,851 --> 01:42:58,601
I'm at wrestling.

4226
01:42:58,601 --> 01:42:59,010
My,

4227
01:42:59,010 --> 01:43:03,250
my Jujitsu has been on point with Fleet
Bay and I've been adding a lot of crazy

4228
01:43:03,251 --> 01:43:04,084
stuff to it.

4229
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:04,660
Um,

4230
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:06,850
because like Dwayne's only
been out three days a week.

4231
01:43:06,851 --> 01:43:07,510
Right.

4232
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:09,100
And we kill it while Dwayne's out here,

4233
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:09,911
but then when he's gone,

4234
01:43:09,911 --> 01:43:10,900
I work on all my other stuff.

4235
01:43:10,901 --> 01:43:14,350
So it's forced me to get into my
Jujitsu little bit more as well.

4236
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:15,041
And,

4237
01:43:15,041 --> 01:43:15,191
uh,

4238
01:43:15,191 --> 01:43:16,150
I've been doing so good,

4239
01:43:16,151 --> 01:43:16,361
man.

4240
01:43:16,361 --> 01:43:17,830
I be wanting to show it off,

4241
01:43:17,831 --> 01:43:19,150
but I haven't got that chance.

4242
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:19,391
Does he,

4243
01:43:19,391 --> 01:43:20,224
have you ranked,

4244
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:21,093
does he give you a bill?

4245
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:23,860
I don't do any g he calls it dude,

4246
01:43:23,861 --> 01:43:24,201
look gay.

4247
01:43:24,201 --> 01:43:27,310
My friend calls me a blue
black cause I Q u a blue belt.

4248
01:43:27,311 --> 01:43:28,300
But really you black,

4249
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:29,270
you know,

4250
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:30,510
so he calls me a blue black.

4251
01:43:30,511 --> 01:43:32,200
She want to wear the
[inaudible] just to get a belt.

4252
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:33,063
I do.

4253
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:33,371
Um,

4254
01:43:33,371 --> 01:43:35,850
I always just out of camp
I always figured out like,

4255
01:43:35,851 --> 01:43:35,960
hey,

4256
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,750
we're not at a time like to get in there.

4257
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,020
I only time I feel like I can go and do
guid training is when I'm not in camp,

4258
01:43:41,021 --> 01:43:42,970
which I want to do it until
I get a fight lined up.

4259
01:43:42,971 --> 01:43:45,770
And actually it was just thinking that
I'm going to go and keep my weight down

4260
01:43:45,771 --> 01:43:47,020
and good way I can do in Yoga,

4261
01:43:47,021 --> 01:43:48,200
but why not go and do some gigs?

4262
01:43:48,201 --> 01:43:49,034
You did too.

4263
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:49,300
Um,

4264
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:50,710
just to do it for fun.

4265
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:53,290
I'm in and show that I can do [inaudible].

4266
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:53,811
Um,

4267
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:54,351
it's fun.

4268
01:43:54,351 --> 01:43:54,501
It's,

4269
01:43:54,501 --> 01:43:54,720
it's,

4270
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:55,730
it's a whole nother game.

4271
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:56,150
Yeah.

4272
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:57,740
But when I'm in camp training,

4273
01:43:57,950 --> 01:43:58,990
I need those fast cramps,

4274
01:43:58,991 --> 01:44:00,410
especially being at a
lighter weight class.

4275
01:44:00,650 --> 01:44:02,360
I need them wrestling scrambles.

4276
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:05,780
And especially if the guy likes to Hutto
like we're not going to do Jujitsu,

4277
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:07,700
we're going to do grapple
and we're going to do MMA,

4278
01:44:07,701 --> 01:44:08,340
Jujitsu,

4279
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:08,651
you know,

4280
01:44:08,651 --> 01:44:09,171
of course.

4281
01:44:09,171 --> 01:44:09,300
Yeah.

4282
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:11,480
And so I needed that
kind of like fast motion.

4283
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:11,750
Um,

4284
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:12,800
especially with smaller guys,

4285
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:17,180
but especially sweating slippery and you
really need gable grips and over hooks

4286
01:44:17,181 --> 01:44:17,850
and yeah,

4287
01:44:17,850 --> 01:44:18,180
yeah,

4288
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:18,520
yeah.

4289
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:21,270
There's just the problem with D Jujitsu,

4290
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,460
there's great things to,

4291
01:44:22,461 --> 01:44:24,650
at one you have to be very
tactical with your defense.

4292
01:44:24,651 --> 01:44:25,910
You can't just muscle out of things.

4293
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:27,320
And that,

4294
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:29,360
that's a big shock for a lot of people.

4295
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:32,180
Like wrestlers in particular that
you used to just exploding out there,

4296
01:44:32,181 --> 01:44:33,820
not everything in reengaging.

4297
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:34,663
And when you get,

4298
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:36,860
you get your collar's grabbed.

4299
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:37,170
Yup.

4300
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:37,480
You're like,

4301
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:38,330
oh shit.

4302
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:39,193
So it's choking.

4303
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:42,950
Someone has your sleeve and they
have your collar and you're like,

4304
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:43,260
ah,

4305
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:44,030
fuck.

4306
01:44:44,030 --> 01:44:44,170
You know,

4307
01:44:44,170 --> 01:44:45,200
I'm locked up here.

4308
01:44:45,230 --> 01:44:45,771
But it's funny.

4309
01:44:45,771 --> 01:44:47,810
It's like more realistic
for as a street fight.

4310
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:48,321
Oh yeah.

4311
01:44:48,321 --> 01:44:48,681
You know,

4312
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:48,890
like,

4313
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:49,910
well that was going to say like,

4314
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:53,990
the last thing you ever want to do is
get like in a street fight with like

4315
01:44:53,991 --> 01:44:56,060
someone who's a judo practitioner,

4316
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:56,871
you know,

4317
01:44:56,871 --> 01:44:58,100
like you just get like,

4318
01:44:58,101 --> 01:44:58,820
um,

4319
01:44:58,820 --> 01:44:59,240
uh,

4320
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,010
John Hackleman had a,

4321
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:04,790
he had a thing on his Instagram
yesterday about that where it's like he's

4322
01:45:04,791 --> 01:45:05,600
pointed to the,

4323
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:05,861
to the,

4324
01:45:05,861 --> 01:45:07,010
the floor of the cage.

4325
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,510
It's like now imagine this is a fight.

4326
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:12,380
This is concrete and this is you and
someone getting hoists in the air.

4327
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:14,090
It's like take down defense,

4328
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:15,830
which is so fucking true.

4329
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:16,970
So,

4330
01:45:16,970 --> 01:45:17,751
so true.

4331
01:45:17,751 --> 01:45:18,980
I mean you,

4332
01:45:18,981 --> 01:45:23,480
if you got an a like Hector Lombard
or someone like that as a judo.

4333
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:23,691
Yeah.

4334
01:45:23,691 --> 01:45:24,141
There it is.

4335
01:45:24,141 --> 01:45:26,180
Imagine this is you and this is concrete.

4336
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:27,750
Fuck yeah,

4337
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:28,170
yeah,

4338
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:28,550
yeah.

4339
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:31,940
Especially if somebody's really fucking
throws their legs up in the air and

4340
01:45:31,941 --> 01:45:32,870
comes down with you.

4341
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,490
Fighting in the street is so dangerous,

4342
01:45:34,491 --> 01:45:34,820
man.

4343
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:35,591
Oh Jesus.

4344
01:45:35,591 --> 01:45:36,261
So dangerous.

4345
01:45:36,261 --> 01:45:37,490
Just hitting your head on the concrete.

4346
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:38,031
Oh Man.

4347
01:45:38,031 --> 01:45:40,050
One getting knocked out and
hitting their head on the concrete.

4348
01:45:40,051 --> 01:45:41,030
It's just so dangerous.

4349
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:41,420
Yeah.

4350
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:44,450
And it happens every God damn day with
people who don't know how to fight,

4351
01:45:44,451 --> 01:45:46,550
which cause they watch the shit and
they think they can go and do it.

4352
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:46,880
You know,

4353
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,200
like I can fucking do that.

4354
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:49,890
A couple of shots of Tequila and yeah,

4355
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:52,460
the best youtube videos
ever is watching that stuff.

4356
01:45:52,490 --> 01:45:53,180
But it's always like,

4357
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:53,541
Oh man,

4358
01:45:53,541 --> 01:45:54,380
that guy might be dead.

4359
01:45:54,830 --> 01:45:55,880
Well if he's not dead,

4360
01:45:55,881 --> 01:45:57,360
he's fucked up for a long time.

4361
01:45:57,361 --> 01:45:57,830
Yeah.

4362
01:45:57,830 --> 01:45:58,140
Yeah.

4363
01:45:58,140 --> 01:45:59,540
I don't think people understand.

4364
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,950
I think I'll do more jets once I'm done
fighting like Jiujitsu just to try to

4365
01:46:03,951 --> 01:46:04,520
get ranked.

4366
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:04,791
You know,

4367
01:46:04,791 --> 01:46:06,230
I'd like to be a black belt one day.

4368
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,340
She works for sure.

4369
01:46:07,410 --> 01:46:08,670
Just so we can make it just,

4370
01:46:08,671 --> 01:46:09,620
just to have that,

4371
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:10,100
uh,

4372
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:11,000
would you like to compete?

4373
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:12,853
I Dunno.

4374
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:13,910
I Dunno what I'm done fighting.

4375
01:46:13,911 --> 01:46:15,260
I don't know if I want
to compete ever again.

4376
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:16,143
Right.

4377
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:17,540
I've competed my whole life.

4378
01:46:17,541 --> 01:46:18,860
I haven't competed since
I was eight years old.

4379
01:46:18,861 --> 01:46:20,060
I've never had a job.

4380
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:21,590
Like I've had side jobs and stuff,

4381
01:46:21,591 --> 01:46:21,861
you know,

4382
01:46:21,861 --> 01:46:23,810
but I've never had like a real,

4383
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:24,550
yeah.

4384
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:25,040
Yeah.

4385
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:25,221
I mean,

4386
01:46:25,221 --> 01:46:28,230
I thought I was going to until I dropped
out of school and decided to become a

4387
01:46:28,690 --> 01:46:29,530
MMA fighter.

4388
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:30,800
I'm parents like you're crazy.

4389
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:32,053
I don't know.

4390
01:46:32,170 --> 01:46:33,200
You're obviously crazy,

4391
01:46:33,201 --> 01:46:36,210
but the most crazy things that you had
this thing in your mind that you wanted

4392
01:46:36,211 --> 01:46:36,801
to out Russell.

4393
01:46:36,801 --> 01:46:37,680
So Hutto yeah,

4394
01:46:37,681 --> 01:46:38,514
I can't have,

4395
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:39,831
it's different man.

4396
01:46:39,831 --> 01:46:41,090
Imma may resonate is different.

4397
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:41,931
It really is,

4398
01:46:41,931 --> 01:46:42,071
man.

4399
01:46:42,071 --> 01:46:42,904
I mean he's,

4400
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:43,371
trust me,

4401
01:46:43,371 --> 01:46:44,750
I would have been a
feat in it's own right.

4402
01:46:44,751 --> 01:46:45,680
He's a great wrestler,

4403
01:46:45,681 --> 01:46:46,760
but it's different man.

4404
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:47,570
Um,

4405
01:46:47,570 --> 01:46:49,040
but the fact that you wanted to do it.

4406
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:49,913
Yeah.

4407
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:50,100
I

4408
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:50,551
want the,

4409
01:46:50,551 --> 01:46:51,990
I want the toughest tough man.

4410
01:46:51,991 --> 01:46:52,824
Like I'm,

4411
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:54,480
I live by the sword,

4412
01:46:54,481 --> 01:46:54,841
die by,

4413
01:46:54,841 --> 01:46:55,351
I got there.

4414
01:46:55,351 --> 01:46:55,660
I,

4415
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:56,401
I sling leather.

4416
01:46:56,401 --> 01:46:56,851
I Bra,

4417
01:46:56,851 --> 01:46:57,571
I want to fight.

4418
01:46:57,571 --> 01:46:59,010
Like I don't have boring fights.

4419
01:46:59,040 --> 01:46:59,580
Um,

4420
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:00,540
I want to,

4421
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:01,470
that's why I wanted a challenge.

4422
01:47:01,471 --> 01:47:02,041
Max Holloway.

4423
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:03,120
That's why I want to beat Henry Su.

4424
01:47:03,121 --> 01:47:06,030
Hutto I want to be the
best and to do that,

4425
01:47:06,031 --> 01:47:07,620
I feel like you really
need to challenge her name.

4426
01:47:07,910 --> 01:47:08,130
Um,

4427
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,360
I'm not just talking the talk,

4428
01:47:09,361 --> 01:47:10,210
I'm not just doing it to,

4429
01:47:10,211 --> 01:47:11,044
to talk shit.

4430
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,450
I really want to do it now.

4431
01:47:12,451 --> 01:47:15,180
Where does the 135 pound
belt sit right now?

4432
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:19,020
Because you're the champion and if you
do decide to pursue the flyway title

4433
01:47:19,021 --> 01:47:21,720
again for everyone else and
that Bantam weight division,

4434
01:47:21,721 --> 01:47:23,130
this is kind of a cluster fuck.

4435
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:23,460
Right.

4436
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:24,293
I agree.

4437
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:26,390
We got a big fight on Saturday with a,

4438
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:28,580
since Alan Marlin Mariah's huge.

4439
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:29,581
And they,

4440
01:47:29,581 --> 01:47:30,750
they've already thought before too.

4441
01:47:30,751 --> 01:47:31,440
So,

4442
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,150
um,

4443
01:47:32,150 --> 01:47:33,390
we'll see what happens with that fight,

4444
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:33,870
you know,

4445
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:36,520
and Cody Garbrandt his
fight and Pedro Munoz,

4446
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:38,640
that's coming up soon as well,

4447
01:47:38,641 --> 01:47:38,881
right?

4448
01:47:38,881 --> 01:47:39,120
Yeah.

4449
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:39,271
Yeah.

4450
01:47:39,271 --> 01:47:40,470
That's coming up in March,

4451
01:47:40,471 --> 01:47:41,070
I believe.

4452
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:43,920
Is that what that does
that the Vegas to 35?

4453
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:44,580
Yeah.

4454
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:47,790
So there's a bunch of big
fights in that division,

4455
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:49,550
but I'd say the one that,

4456
01:47:49,551 --> 01:47:49,800
that,

4457
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:53,180
that really kind of plays a factor
would be a cin seven Marlon Mariah's.

4458
01:47:53,181 --> 01:47:53,360
Yeah.

4459
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:53,840
Right.

4460
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:54,130
Yeah.

4461
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:54,840
Um,

4462
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:58,800
which I have beaten to a since hell.

4463
01:47:58,880 --> 01:47:59,100
Right.

4464
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:00,630
And one of them rise had been
looking good as well too,

4465
01:48:00,631 --> 01:48:02,040
but since I was going a big wind streak,

4466
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:03,270
so I will see,

4467
01:48:03,271 --> 01:48:03,571
man.

4468
01:48:03,571 --> 01:48:03,781
I mean,

4469
01:48:03,781 --> 01:48:04,441
it depends if a fight,

4470
01:48:04,441 --> 01:48:05,880
so who do at 35 to like,

4471
01:48:05,881 --> 01:48:07,200
I don't know what's what.

4472
01:48:07,201 --> 01:48:07,381
I mean,

4473
01:48:07,381 --> 01:48:10,980
obviously I want it at 25 so he's talking
about saving the flyweight division.

4474
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:12,060
Let's pump this thing up.

4475
01:48:12,061 --> 01:48:12,691
Let's get it done.

4476
01:48:12,691 --> 01:48:13,261
Like I want to,

4477
01:48:13,261 --> 01:48:15,680
but you don't want to relinquish
your 35 pounds crowns.

4478
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:17,250
What if they come around and they say,

4479
01:48:17,251 --> 01:48:17,371
Hey,

4480
01:48:17,371 --> 01:48:18,330
you've got to defend.

4481
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:19,500
I want to be active too.

4482
01:48:19,501 --> 01:48:21,230
That's also something I want to
say when I was getting on here,

4483
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:23,430
cause I'm calling out 45
from calling out this,

4484
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:26,940
but also don't want to be the guy that's
just going to walk away from my belt

4485
01:48:26,941 --> 01:48:29,640
either like I want to be the
cowboy Cerrone and be more active.

4486
01:48:29,641 --> 01:48:31,050
I haven't been active enough lately.

4487
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:32,161
I've been too long.

4488
01:48:32,161 --> 01:48:33,000
It gaps a fighting big,

4489
01:48:33,001 --> 01:48:34,470
but because he's fights
have been built up,

4490
01:48:34,471 --> 01:48:35,280
hyped up,

4491
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:36,060
people get hurt.

4492
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:36,893
This and that.

4493
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:38,250
I want to be a little more active.

4494
01:48:38,251 --> 01:48:39,660
I'm always in shape.

4495
01:48:39,661 --> 01:48:40,560
I'm always in the gym.

4496
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:41,241
Um,

4497
01:48:41,241 --> 01:48:44,880
was be a little bit more of the
w one of my training partners.

4498
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,320
Why don't Shalita he fights.

4499
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:49,170
He fought for fights for
bold tour in 10 months.

4500
01:48:49,171 --> 01:48:49,471
You know,

4501
01:48:49,471 --> 01:48:51,300
like I want to be a little more active.

4502
01:48:51,301 --> 01:48:52,170
That's how I get paid.

4503
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:52,950
I'm sure.

4504
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:56,340
Turning 33 on February 7th so my
career's not going to last forever.

4505
01:48:56,341 --> 01:48:57,690
I want to start clicking and paychecks,

4506
01:48:57,691 --> 01:48:58,050
you know.

4507
01:48:58,050 --> 01:49:01,230
When do you think you're gonna do you
have a big game plan or when you're going

4508
01:49:01,231 --> 01:49:02,280
to ride off into the sunset?

4509
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:03,000
Uh,

4510
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,350
not necessarily.

4511
01:49:04,351 --> 01:49:06,540
I guess when the opportunities
that it doesn't seem,

4512
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:10,350
it doesn't seem like it makes
sense as well as maybe my health,

4513
01:49:10,351 --> 01:49:11,820
as long as everything's going well,

4514
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:12,540
um,

4515
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:13,410
I feel healthy.

4516
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:14,100
Um,

4517
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:17,790
which the way I've been treating my
body is the healthiest I've ever been.

4518
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:18,690
Um,

4519
01:49:18,690 --> 01:49:19,523
which is crazy.

4520
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:20,040
Um,

4521
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:21,930
so as long as I have the
right people around me,

4522
01:49:21,931 --> 01:49:23,820
like my wife and my
coaches have told me like,

4523
01:49:23,821 --> 01:49:24,211
look man,

4524
01:49:24,211 --> 01:49:24,960
you need to hang it up.

4525
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,520
And I feel like I have
those people around me.

4526
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:27,900
Like I don't want to be the,

4527
01:49:27,901 --> 01:49:28,051
I mean,

4528
01:49:28,051 --> 01:49:28,681
I don't want to talk shit.

4529
01:49:28,681 --> 01:49:30,870
I don't want to be like the chocolate
l fighting because I need it.

4530
01:49:30,871 --> 01:49:31,570
Right.

4531
01:49:31,570 --> 01:49:33,990
Another reason why I've
created other businesses too.

4532
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:35,220
I don't have to fight.

4533
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:35,691
I don't,

4534
01:49:35,691 --> 01:49:37,050
I don't want to fight cause I have to,

4535
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:37,861
you know,

4536
01:49:37,861 --> 01:49:38,521
so I've been,

4537
01:49:38,521 --> 01:49:39,690
I've been really smart with my money.

4538
01:49:39,691 --> 01:49:43,050
I've been really smart with my
investments to where I could walk away,

4539
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:43,560
you know?

4540
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:43,950
But,

4541
01:49:43,950 --> 01:49:44,760
um,

4542
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,080
I have too much to prove right now.

4543
01:49:46,470 --> 01:49:46,711
You know,

4544
01:49:46,711 --> 01:49:48,220
I have too much to get back at him.

4545
01:49:48,221 --> 01:49:50,350
First and foremost is
fighting in century pseudo.

4546
01:49:50,910 --> 01:49:51,340
Um,

4547
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:51,651
well I'm,

4548
01:49:51,651 --> 01:49:54,370
I'm glad to hear that you
are like thinking about that,

4549
01:49:54,371 --> 01:49:55,750
that you're planning for the future.

4550
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:57,310
There's a lot of guys that have done,

4551
01:49:57,311 --> 01:50:00,970
like Mike Bisping has planned very
well for the future and you know,

4552
01:50:00,971 --> 01:50:01,210
uh,

4553
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:02,043
there's,

4554
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:02,501
you know,

4555
01:50:02,501 --> 01:50:06,160
Brennan shops like the fucking gold
standard and he's really taken off since

4556
01:50:06,161 --> 01:50:07,210
he's decided to retire.

4557
01:50:07,630 --> 01:50:08,200
But it's,

4558
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:08,501
you know,

4559
01:50:08,501 --> 01:50:09,790
there's a lot of stuff that you can do.

4560
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,410
It's good to see that
you're doing this and,

4561
01:50:11,650 --> 01:50:11,900
uh,

4562
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:13,750
tell people how to get
ahold of this flavor.

4563
01:50:13,751 --> 01:50:14,970

4564
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:16,820
We're on a flavor republic.

4565
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:17,051
Dot.

4566
01:50:17,051 --> 01:50:17,590

you can find us anywhere.

4572
01:50:21,101 --> 01:50:24,640

a website to really check out who we are

4573
01:50:24,641 --> 01:50:25,840

4574
01:50:26,230 --> 01:50:26,591
Um,

4575
01:50:26,591 --> 01:50:30,520

4579
01:50:31,931 --> 01:50:33,610
what's it Sam's at but
I've created with him,

4580
01:50:33,611 --> 01:50:34,810
it's called train champ.

4581
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:35,820
Um,

4582
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:37,600
it's a training lab.com.

4583
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:38,500
Um,

4584
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:39,610
so there's like a difference.

4585
01:50:39,611 --> 01:50:41,650
So if you are into martial
arts and getting in shape,

4586
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:43,600
my fit to fight program is,

4587
01:50:43,601 --> 01:50:47,140
is going to not only make you better
technically and I feel like it's one of a

4588
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:49,540
kind of teaches MMA for everything.

4589
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:51,250
So like kickboxing from him,

4590
01:50:51,290 --> 01:50:52,810
a boxing from MMA,

4591
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:56,590
wrestling from May and Jujitsu
for an instructional thing,

4592
01:50:56,591 --> 01:51:00,310
but it's also a training program and
strength conditioning for him in May.

4593
01:51:00,311 --> 01:51:00,820
Right.

4594
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:02,620
Everything's based
around like a fight camp.

4595
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:06,230
That's why it's fit to fight
Sam Calvert has is like the um,

4596
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:07,610
if you're really into your body,

4597
01:51:07,611 --> 01:51:08,500
you want to be healthy,

4598
01:51:08,501 --> 01:51:11,770
want to get in crazy shape or if
you have goals to gain weight,

4599
01:51:11,771 --> 01:51:12,604
lose weight,

4600
01:51:12,730 --> 01:51:15,310
get your hair analysis done and
realize like what's in your body or

4601
01:51:15,311 --> 01:51:16,270
supplementation.

4602
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:20,620
They do go hand in hand but depends like
say if you want to just be more of like

4603
01:51:20,621 --> 01:51:22,570
I'm getting in shape and be healthy.

4604
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:27,260
That one's like you'll get
more information you can
ever imagine off for Sam's

4605
01:51:27,261 --> 01:51:27,421
App.

4606
01:51:27,421 --> 01:51:28,480
Like when I tell you about stuff,

4607
01:51:28,481 --> 01:51:29,980
it's hard for me to
even explain everything.

4608
01:51:30,370 --> 01:51:32,440
His App or his website will
tell you more about it.

4609
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:33,970
And your stuff is all web based.

4610
01:51:33,971 --> 01:51:34,960
You're fit to five programs.

4611
01:51:34,961 --> 01:51:35,794
Yes.

4612
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,270
So like Ipad,

4613
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:38,320
laptop,

4614
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:38,681
yes.

4615
01:51:38,681 --> 01:51:39,401
My fit to fight.

4616
01:51:39,401 --> 01:51:40,960
Like once you buy the fit to fight,

4617
01:51:40,961 --> 01:51:43,270
you get all 140 videos.

4618
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:44,260
It's like all the cart.

4619
01:51:44,261 --> 01:51:45,094
You get them all like,

4620
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:46,840
and I run you through like,

4621
01:51:46,841 --> 01:51:47,674
um,

4622
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:50,410
so say we're doing kickboxing
today for our workout.

4623
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:51,670
Like I've worn out a class,

4624
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:54,340
we're going to do kickboxing drills and
then I'll pair them up with a string

4625
01:51:54,341 --> 01:51:57,100
conditioning workout that will
make you better at kickboxing.

4626
01:51:57,430 --> 01:51:57,581
You know,

4627
01:51:57,581 --> 01:51:59,530
maybe I'm doing some
core stuff or some uh,

4628
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:02,920
footwork drills and then I'm
doing how to throw a head kick,

4629
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:04,053
things like that.

4630
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:04,960
It's um,

4631
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:06,340
it's a full,

4632
01:52:06,341 --> 01:52:07,090
full schedule,

4633
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:09,220
you know that little website
to Oh that looks nice.

4634
01:52:09,221 --> 01:52:09,820
Thank you man.

4635
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:10,361
It took,

4636
01:52:10,361 --> 01:52:11,920
it's taken me a long time to build it.

4637
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:12,783
Um,

4638
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:16,960
been over a year of recording videos and
building it and obviously it's like 15

4639
01:52:16,961 --> 01:52:21,140
years of my knowledge of me putting in
through wrestling and in all my main

4640
01:52:21,230 --> 01:52:22,061
career and stuff too.

4641
01:52:22,061 --> 01:52:23,770
So I've been doing that.

4642
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:25,241
I'm doing so much.

4643
01:52:25,241 --> 01:52:25,811
I have a,

4644
01:52:25,811 --> 01:52:27,190
a company I'm starting,

4645
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:30,340
well not starting and franchising out a
cold press juice company in Yorba Linda

4646
01:52:30,341 --> 01:52:31,240
called clean juice.

4647
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:32,351
It's really cool.

4648
01:52:32,351 --> 01:52:33,940
I'm opening that up here in
the next couple of months.

4649
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:34,871
I am,

4650
01:52:34,871 --> 01:52:36,100
I'm really thinking about my future.

4651
01:52:36,101 --> 01:52:37,630
I've got a one year old kid and I got,

4652
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:38,411
you know,

4653
01:52:38,411 --> 01:52:39,850
futures of having more kids.

4654
01:52:39,851 --> 01:52:43,420
And so I wanted to be able to be around
and have my career set up for that,

4655
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:43,690
you know?

4656
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:44,291
That's awesome,

4657
01:52:44,291 --> 01:52:44,920
dude.

4658
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:45,080
Well,

4659
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:45,411
listen,

4660
01:52:45,411 --> 01:52:45,980
best of luck

4661
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:46,311
to you.

4662
01:52:46,311 --> 01:52:50,120
Congratulations on everything you've done
so far and can't wait to see you back

4663
01:52:50,121 --> 01:52:51,110
in there and let us know,

4664
01:52:51,111 --> 01:52:52,280
like when you're fighting again,

4665
01:52:52,281 --> 01:52:53,440
and we'll let everybody else,

4666
01:52:53,450 --> 01:52:53,601

4667
01:52:53,601 --> 01:52:54,351
I'll let everyone know,

4668
01:52:54,351 --> 01:52:54,471
man.

4669
01:52:54,471 --> 01:52:55,270
I really appreciate it.

4670
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:55,971
Thank you very much,

4671
01:52:55,971 --> 01:52:56,391
TJ.

4672
01:52:56,391 --> 01:52:57,590
Dillashaw ladies and gentlemen.

4673
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:07,180
Hmm.
