1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,020
I remember I was telling you guys
at one time my freshman year,

2
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:08,580
I didn't take her shit
for a week and a half.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:09,721
I used to,

4
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:10,850
I was addicted to steak.

5
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:11,684
Comes from American.

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,050
Jeez and all right.

7
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:13,884
A French bro.

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,393
Listen to me.

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,733
I was in,

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,600
I played freshman ball and we
were playing Paddison east side.

11
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,760
That's just a jungle of a school.

12
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:27,410
Like you gotta be careful
when you go in there.

13
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,260
And uh,

14
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,940
we went there to play
the Christmas tournament.

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,020
Well,

16
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,510
what kind of ball are we talking about?

17
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,420
Basketball and I hadn't taken a
shift from like 10 days or something.

18
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:39,180
I took acid,

19
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,530
something.

20
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,363
Fuck my stomach.

21
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,480
I didn't tell nobody.

22
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,340
No Way.

23
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:43,551
Home.

24
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:44,420
We got on the bus

25
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,110
and while we were waiting there,

26
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,370
my stomach started hurting.

27
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:50,911
I said,

28
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:51,810
Jesus Christ,

29
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,330
I don't know if I'm going
to shoot myself a Fart,

30
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,980
but let me just take a chance.

31
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,170
And I blew this far.

32
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,013
Joe Rogan,

33
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,900
that was so bad,

34
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,100
right?

35
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,060
We want a bus.

36
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,020
And people started running,

37
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:04,231
you know,

38
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,130
the school buses,

39
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,870
people started running to the window
is right to swing down the bus windows.

40
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,510
But here's what you got
by the Ifr that again,

41
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,530
the teachers are going,

42
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,161
oh my God,

43
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:16,270
he's changing flavors.

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,110
What's the worst thing was
the cheerleaders are crying.

45
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,230
That's how bad they were
sitting in front of a bus.

46
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,870
One of the teachers yell,

47
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,190
does my God,

48
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:34,024
he's changing.

49
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,360
That's how bad these parts.

50
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,530
We don't mind.

51
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,060
He's changing your whole bus
dog fight was fucking God awful.

52
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,180
I wrote a blog about
one to Joyce farts ones.

53
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,660
Does that on a plane?

54
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,260
Yes.

55
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,093
They got rid of that.

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,060
Okay.
