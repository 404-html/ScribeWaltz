1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,363
Okay,

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,980
Ladies and gentlemen,
is the ces wrap up with young Jamie.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,360
Hey.
Hey.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,030
So uh,
you decided to go to the consumer

5
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:19,810
electronic show,
this big gigantic expo that they have in

6
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:24,280
Vegas every year.
It's like the show for new computer,

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,610
gadget tree,
everything and like anything you'd see

8
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:31,420
at like a fry's or best buy from all the
way down to anything that'd be in a car.

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,280
Anything in a kitchen or anything in the
bedroom?

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,710
Anything.
Consumer electronics basically.

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,250
So the show is essentially everything
that's coming out,

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,090
all the stuff that's on its way out of
things that have just been announced I

13
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:44,440
think.
And then I think most of the stuff

14
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,600
that's supposed to be coming out for
sale this year.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,520
Okay.
So some of it is,

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,010
we were just about to get into it,
but we were like,

17
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:52,450
God you got to say it for the podcast.

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,330
You were saying that some of it you
think they're kind of bullshitting.

19
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,300
I saw a lot of things that I just like,
they might not be ready or their

20
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:00,250
prototypes and just like at a car show
too.

21
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:01,780
There are some things are just showing
you,

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,570
this is what we can do right now.
This isn't even what's going to be

23
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:05,950
available.
This is what we can do.

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,200
Maybe if there's a lot of interests will
make it.

25
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,200
For instance,
there was this really cool laptop that

26
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:14,920
has three screens on it now,
so if the gaming laptop that you can get

27
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,310
some sort of crazy,
but they were just prototypes to and two

28
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,890
of them just got stolen last night or
two days ago.

29
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,970
So they're trying to get at them,
take them back.

30
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,370
So they stole prototypes.
I don't know how that could have even

31
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:28,710
happened.
Oh,

32
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,583
gross.

33
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,080
How gross to think that some nerds are
thieves,

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,750
right?
Wouldn't you like to think that like

35
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,420
whoever,
you know,

36
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,080
whoever you have to be to be an
innovator in technology and electronics,

37
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:43,240
you would have to be some super fucking
smart guy.

38
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,660
You would think you'd just leave every
room open with people like that.

39
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,660
Wouldn't you like to think that?
I would like.

40
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,610
Yeah,
for sure you'd like to.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,150
But that's accounting world.
I kind of threw them,

42
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,890
but I mean that's fucking crazy.
You know what,

43
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,380
dude,
I'm balls deep into house of cards right

44
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:59,960
now.
First season apparent.

45
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:01,490
I didn't know.
There's so many seasons.

46
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:03,090
It started in 2012.
Yeah,

47
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,390
yeah,
yeah.

48
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,700
There's three,
three seasons.

49
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,760
I think that's it.
I think so.

50
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,550
Yeah.
So did they take a long time to make a

51
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:11,630
season?
Yeah,

52
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,400
for sure.
I mean I think they completed it and

53
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,530
then they shot the whole thing then read
it again.

54
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,290
So there's a little bit.
That's good.

55
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,390
God Damn show dude.
A spoiler alert.

56
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:21,410
She anything,
don't you?

57
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:24,530
Dare you send.
How many episodes are there?

58
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:27,500
You think it's probably 11 or 12 and
each one.

59
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:31,700
So God damn.
It's a good show that Kevin Spacey's

60
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,400
motherfucker.
Woo.

61
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,990
Yeah.
Good ups and

62
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,450
telling me that thing is just the
dumbest shit ever is discussing a show.

63
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,440
Um,
you know,

64
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,020
like today in this day and age,
it's not like you could talk about loss

65
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:50,030
because it was just on the air,
you know,

66
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,990
when we were watching last,
that's how recent this dvr thing and

67
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:58,610
this streaming thing has gone.
When we were watching last.

68
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,010
That wasn't a long ago

69
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,260
man.
And everybody waited until it came on

70
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:05,860
the next week and you could dvr it,
but you didn't.

71
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,150
He didn't.
Bend Watch

72
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,080
wasn't there even that,
uh,

73
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,730
they even did things that we had where
they would show like three episodes and

74
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:15,030
then take a four week break and then to
show two more and then take another

75
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:16,890
break.
You remember how that would work.

76
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:19,320
And then I think the writer's strike
happened in the middle of it too.

77
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:24,150
So there was a longer gap too.
I think I came into last.

78
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,610
Well I think I got the DVD of like the
second,

79
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,090
the like when the second season was out
of the first season.

80
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,750
I think that's how I got into it.
I kind of trying to remember now.

81
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,760
I really enjoyed it up until the end,
but I'll never forget this one moment.

82
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,510
There was this one moment where they
were all standard around this pond and

83
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:49,050
it was like some pond that like brings
you back to life or some shit like that.

84
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,950
And they were like,
I don't remember what the scene was,

85
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,120
but it was something insane.
And they're sitting there with their

86
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:00,790
arms crossed,
waiting for their turn to talk.

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,300
Like the scene was so flat and fake.
I was like,

88
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:05,080
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

89
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,210
You guys are in front of a magical lake
right now.

90
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,090
You're not freaking out like this is.
This is how you respond.

91
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,800
And you just standing there with your
arms crossed,

92
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,810
just do another merger,
Glueck,

93
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,000
whatever the fuck it was.
I was like,

94
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,250
I can't do this anymore.
I can't do it anymore.

95
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,270
Plus they killed Charlie

96
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,860
once they killed Charlie.
I was that Bonita that day as such.

97
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,850
I was really.
That's probably the best episode of the

98
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,030
whole show.
The whole.

99
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,960
They tied everything together at that
really good,

100
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,190
great show.
That was up until the end.

101
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,350
The end.
Those are keys dot.

102
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,400
Okay.
We're good.

103
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,350
Did you just happens with the show?
It's right.

104
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,800
It's like relationship sometimes.
Just a guy.

105
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,651
Okay.
It was great.

106
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:45,380
They're getting
enough,

107
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,120
enough fucking zombies enough this
enough ogres

108
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,000
enough that that's Kinda how I am with
game of thrones.

109
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:59,001
No offense to those dare you well enough
for the dragons and shut your mouth.

110
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,040
That's the one I have in last,

111
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,840
any enthusiasm for,
but I got to tell you,

112
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:10,400
westworld was so good.
I got sucked in so quick and I in the

113
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:15,401
possibilities are so fascinating because
they're their timeline jumping and it's

114
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:16,280
just,

115
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,730
it's really interesting to me.
It was kind of.

116
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,740
They didn't,
they weren't up for many golden gloves

117
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:24,050
on that,
but hbo didn't win anything and I only

118
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:27,170
remember seeing one or two westworld
people even up for anything.

119
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,040
It's kind of shitty.

120
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,290
Maybe they missed the nomination date.
I don't know.

121
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,840
How could she not nominate?
That show's awesome.

122
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,490
Fuck.
That shows good.

123
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,670
That's crazy.
Well,

124
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,090
it just shows you if that is the case,
maybe it's just there's a lot of other

125
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,540
shows that are even more awesome.
The we're just not aware of yet.

126
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,300
This seems like the Golden Age for TV
shows.

127
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,160
It really does.

128
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,581
Yeah.
The show.

129
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:51,590
That one I hadn't heard.
It's called the night manager.

130
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:54,080
That one,
like a Hugh Laurie who used to be house.

131
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,050
He won an award for that and the other
Guy Tom Hiddleston when another word.

132
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,710
Somebody was just telling me about that.
Someone's short six,

133
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,990
seven episodes.
I think it's a Netflix thing,

134
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:03,824
right?
I don't.

135
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,800
It might be on Netflix now,
but I think it was on something else to

136
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,663
originally.

137
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,560
This is an amazing time for television.
Think about all the great shows.

138
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,010
I haven't seen the OAA yet,
but I keep hearing that.

139
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:16,460
It's amazing for.
That's good too.

140
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,270
It's supposed to be A.
I don't want to even want to say what

141
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:21,990
it's supposed to be.
You're like,

142
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,410
you're not even supposed to know too
much about it before you watch it.

143
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,700
That's the best way to do this.

144
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,010
For sure.
A good way to go.

145
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,650
Like stranger things.
I didn't know shit about stranger things

146
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,020
until I jumped in.
I didn't know a goddamn thing.

147
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,110
I still haven't got play on it yet.
Fuck yeah,

148
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,330
that's good.
That's good.

149
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,130
Don't let.
Don't let red band steer you wrong.

150
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,960
It's some things to see you just see a
tweet some time to just what's in your

151
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:46,610
head.
I don't know what it is about the day

152
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:49,460
you see it or the timing was like,
fuck that show.

153
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:51,950
So He's like,
I've never seen it.

154
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:54,560
I don't care how it would have been
awesome if you hit play,

155
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:59,180
but somebody says just it's the first
thing you heard about it and now you're

156
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,560
fucked.
Yeah.

157
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,460
And then you're like,
well,

158
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,140
sometimes you watch it and you're
surprised.

159
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,590
I don't even know how often that happens
when you're surprised on some.

160
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:07,424
You see,

161
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,810
it's so hard to tell because people's
tastes vary so much.

162
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,330
It's almost like they're watching
something different than you

163
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,810
who you are like as a person,
your life experiences and what that show

164
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,510
means to you when you're watching it.
It's so different for all of us.

165
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,670
Like for each one of us is different.
That's what's weird about televisions.

166
00:07:30,671 --> 00:07:34,750
What's weird about books and music and
comedy and pretty much everything.

167
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,920
It's,
there's not one universal awesome thing.

168
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:40,960
There's some shit that like everybody
goes,

169
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,690
God down.
It's good no matter what [inaudible]

170
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:44,900
like,
like Michael Jackson and his prime.

171
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,200
You know,
I remember there was this radio station

172
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,300
in Boston.
Uh,

173
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,750
it was,
um,

174
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,101
I think,
uh,

175
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:57,101
pretty sure it was wbcn.
It was either wbcn or Wcio Z.

176
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,820
Those are like the two rock stations.
Coc was a little harder.

177
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,300
If you're a nosy person,
you were like a little bit more into

178
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:08,360
like Metallica a little harder.

179
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,300
Yeah.
And bcn.

180
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,620
I'm pretty sure it's bcn.
They played a Michael Jackson song and

181
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,220
Dez back when Djs could just play music,
you know,

182
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,370
was a different world.
They could just play whatever they

183
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,740
wanted to.
They could just like as if you were a DJ

184
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:27,840
right now and you had a bunch of records
and you had an internet radio station.

185
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,660
If they let you do it,
I don't think you can,

186
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:32,510
but if they did let you do it,
you just play those records.

187
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,960
I'm play whatever the fuck you want.
That doesn't exist anymore.

188
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,630
It doesn't exist.
So this dude,

189
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:43,631
I wish I could remember who it was,
just started playing this Michael

190
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,051
Jackson Song.
He goes,

191
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:47,330
I don't care why you like this is great
music.

192
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,743
You don't remember the song?

193
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,310
Sure was Billie Jean.
Okay.

194
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,690
I'm sure it was billy Jean because that
wasn't that all off a thriller was

195
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:06,051
Billie Jean on thriller to.
It's hard,

196
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,930
I think for people today because there's
so many superstars,

197
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,470
there's so many different venues.
I mean there's people that are

198
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,710
superstars just from the Internet.
Yeah,

199
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:17,160
it was on thriller.
Yeah.

200
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,360
It's hard for people.
I think today I think there's a much,

201
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:25,800
much larger number of celebrities and
have super celebrities,

202
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,180
you know,
of beyond ses and Jay z and Kanye

203
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,370
West's.
There's so many of those now that it,

204
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,530
it kind of,
um,

205
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,140
we,
we don't,

206
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,940
I don't think we can appreciate today
what it was like when Michael Jackson

207
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:44,870
was in his heyday because there was
like,

208
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,320
he,
there was one,

209
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,340
it was one guy,
it was one guy that just boom,

210
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,410
there was no one like Michael Jackson,
one guy who had so much impact on the

211
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:58,710
culture.
People were wearing those stupid jackets

212
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,620
everywhere and dancing that way.
I mean,

213
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,620
Corey Feldman,
Corey Feldman and Corey Haim,

214
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:07,380
the two of them would go out and they
were buddies with Michael Jackson,

215
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:09,150
so they would dress like him.
Me,

216
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,310
it was a serious trend,
man.

217
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,730
People wanted a.
There was that trend and there was the

218
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:18,470
other one with the hat.
Smooth criminal,

219
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,350
there was a little bit of that,
that people were one glove.

220
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,310
Was that a fuck?
Yeah,

221
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:23,390
they did.
Yeah,

222
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,710
it's hard.
It's,

223
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,640
I think it's hard for us to appreciate
how crazy that was with no internet,

224
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,210
just television stations and radio
stations

225
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,070
and much less people on the planet
that's even weirder.

226
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,110
So what do we have like 100 million more
people than when I was a kid.

227
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,100
What was the,
what was the,

228
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:54,350
uh,
find out what the population was in 1980

229
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,310
in the United States because that would
have been when I was like 13

230
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,180
because I was in high school in
[inaudible] 81 to 226 point $5 million.

231
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,900
Two hundred million more people here
now.

232
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:16,430
$100.
Million more people here than when I was

233
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:19,640
a kid.
That's fucking bananas.

234
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,760
Wow.
That's an insane number

235
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,160
mean.
That's really hard to imagine.

236
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,190
It's really hard to imagine you stop and
think about what that means for another

237
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,130
30 or 40 years.
If it's going to go up another 100

238
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,810
million,
where are we going to put all these

239
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:49,370
fucking people?
I mean they say that it peaks off

240
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:51,200
though,
um,

241
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,230
when cities and start doing better
because then they start having less

242
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:58,450
children because they,
um,

243
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,660
there economic situation turns up and
then a lot of women get careers and

244
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:07,980
they're more reluctant to give up those
careers to have children and they have

245
00:12:07,981 --> 00:12:09,750
less children when they do have
children.

246
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,470
And so they think that if you look at
the trends towards urbanization,

247
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,280
there could potentially be a time in the
future where we worried about a decline

248
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,320
in population,
like a natural decline.

249
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,900
But it sounds like horse shit to me.

250
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,470
I've heard that too.
I feel like Porsche,

251
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,090
I feel like I've heard it,
that it's happening now that it's not

252
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,460
that we've almost not peaked,
but it's,

253
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,130
it's on a decline in some places for
sure.

254
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:35,964
I think I've read.

255
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,810
I think people are just moving out of
those spots and coming here.

256
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,340
It's crazy.
It's obvious there's more people now

257
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:44,900
than ever.
It's a trend.

258
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,980
It's 100 million trend in the last,
whatever it was.

259
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:49,970
Thirty plus years.

260
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,350
I wish I was trying to pull it up right
now.

261
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:56,351
I just saw an article yesterday maybe
about how many houses are needed in Los

262
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,780
Angeles to keep up with the housing
required in 100,000 houses a year.

263
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,600
Yeah.

264
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,120
They have to build a 100,000 houses a
year.

265
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,073
Yeah,
and that's like,

266
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,090
that's silly.
Oh my God,

267
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:08,320
that's insane.

268
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,973
Because there's no room.

269
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,830
I did this thing before my showtime
special in 2005 where I was comparing

270
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,540
like mountains and lakes and rivers to
what you see when you see a city,

271
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,930
how it looks like a growth and then it's
like a lot of other gross,

272
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:31,750
like even if you burn it,
like you got to burn it all off.

273
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:35,740
Otherwise it just comes back and it gets
bigger and stronger and if you could

274
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:38,530
look at it as something.
If you were outside of

275
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,730
our understandings and our knowledge of
what cities are and people and languages

276
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:50,390
and communities and cultures and if you
could look past all that,

277
00:13:50,391 --> 00:13:53,660
you'd look at these things that are
growing on this planet.

278
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,080
He'd look at this concrete weird fucking
growth and when you break it out,

279
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:03,530
if that's a real number.
If we need 100,000 houses a year,

280
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,230
I saw this picture,
this was on reddit yesterday or the

281
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:09,750
other day,
and this is a 60 square foot flat.

282
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,430
It says in Hong Kong,
I believe.

283
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,440
Oh my God.
Yeah.

284
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,390
It's.
It's basically people that I look.

285
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,340
I don't know how many.
This is two people living in here.

286
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:18,390
It looks like,
at least to.

287
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,160
This is like a closet

288
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,200
and every time the closet,
everything is in there.

289
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:26,290
The tiny little refrigerator.
Tiny little sink.

290
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,150
This is crazy.

291
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,540
Yeah.
Just sleeping on bunk beds.

292
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,900
Yeah.

293
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,310
It's just this is not good for people.
Yeah.

294
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,320
Why?
Why would people choose to do.

295
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:42,890
Like if you,
if you weren't a person and you were

296
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:44,470
looking at this,
you'd be like,

297
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:47,100
why don't they spread out?
Why don't they spread out?

298
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:49,500
What are they doing in themselves?
Do they like it like this?

299
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,690
Does they have to be there?
A

300
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,310
family keeps them there.
Then the city or like from keeping for

301
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,930
moving to Hong Kong,
so we can only speculate,

302
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:57,350
but I think

303
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,720
the population in Hong Kong,
it's fucking bananas.

304
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,593
It's true,
right?

305
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,860
There's just too many fucking people
I.

306
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,790
Yeah.
I don't know,

307
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,860
man.
It just weirds me out.

308
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,660
When you,
when you look at people like a

309
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:11,960
mathematical thing,
don't just look at him like,

310
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,580
hey,
that's my friend Jamie.

311
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:14,601
You know,
hey,

312
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,370
that's this guy.
And I know that guy.

313
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:17,270
Oh,
that guy is cool.

314
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,220
Instead of that,
it's just looking at like math.

315
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:24,221
Let's just look at the sheer volume.
Then watch it as it multiplies and

316
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:28,070
continues to multiply in.
That one multiplies and keeps going and

317
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:31,640
going and then the people move here and
multiply and it's all multiplication.

318
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,161
You're like,
we'll,

319
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:33,591
we'll,
we'll,

320
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:33,981
we'll,
we'll,

321
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:38,981
we're not planning this out or oh,
we're just stack it up.

322
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:43,490
Fucking houses weighted mean it's going
to get to a point where there's nothing

323
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:47,980
else but houses,
if we keep going,

324
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,800
I don't understand why people think that
that's totally sustainable by the way.

325
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:55,180
That's coming from someone with three
kids.

326
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:56,380
So I should probably shut the fuck up.

327
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,673
Did you,
uh,

328
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,270
have you,
have you gotten further into Black

329
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,850
Mirror yet?
No,

330
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:03,550
just two episodes.
I just did two.

331
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,170
I will go,
I will watch more,

332
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,310
but I really enjoyed the memory one.
That was the one that you kept telling

333
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:10,850
me,
you saying?

334
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,683
Yep,
Yep.

335
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,510
Well they had an awesome take on it too,
that the um,

336
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,460
I don't want to spoiler alert anybody,
but they,

337
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,313
um,

338
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,320
they were able to record their memories
and that's what we've been talking about

339
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,870
that for years that I think,
you know,

340
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,870
I think a lot of people have been
talking about that because it's pretty

341
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,100
obvious transition between being able to
record memories with your phone,

342
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,930
which is essentially that's what a felon
does.

343
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,170
You know,
when you're taking photos and videos and

344
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:43,140
stuff from your phone,
you recording memories and how long

345
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:45,960
before it's somewhere where you could
play it on your brain.

346
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,050
I could see it in your head and you
know,

347
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,933
we,
we've,

348
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,480
we think that
I would,

349
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,640
I would love to see
if there is a way that they can even

350
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:02,840
take photos that way because I know they
can transfer images.

351
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,980
They can transfer like an image into
someone's mind now.

352
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:11,120
Like in like very like simple,
like a triangle and you see a triangle.

353
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,630
Isn't that in that the latest

354
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,390
sorta.
I mean it's still a.

355
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,793
okay.

356
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,720
I know you're talking about.
Yeah,

357
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,200
and there was one where they were able
to transmit a word through the Internet.

358
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,350
Right?
That was more like a one and zero thing.

359
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:28,870
It was like on or off,
like are you feeling and not kind of

360
00:17:28,871 --> 00:17:29,800
thing.
That's what it was.

361
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,490
I thought it was an actual word or
gotten into what a word is spelled that

362
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:34,660
they might have spelled out the word.

363
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,530
I don't think it was a spelled out
thing.

364
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,920
I wish I could remember the explanation
they gave for it,

365
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,460
but I think it was like what that word
represents,

366
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,480
you know,
like.

367
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,390
So the intent of that word
and like so the person on the other

368
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:51,800
side,
like I knew the word,

369
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:55,370
like know or knew the word not or
whatever the word was

370
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,850
says they were able to send the words
Ola and chow from Indian France subjects

371
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,720
solve messages of flashes of light in
the peripheral vision.

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,540
The results described as remarkable step
in human communication.

373
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,570
Who that is fucking crazy.
They're sending messages through the

374
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:20,890
Internet.
They were able to send the words,

375
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,860
scroll up a little bit back where they
were.

376
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,730
They were able to send the words Olan
Chow from a location in India to

377
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:31,280
location and France transmitted signals
directly.

378
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,030
Wow.
Like this is nuts.

379
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,440
It's just hard to imagine
how far that could go.

380
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,470
You know they can do that.
Now.

381
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,400
What I've been thinking,
this sounds like total bananas,

382
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,000
but I've really been thinking a lot
about it lately is that you don't have

383
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:53,570
the internet kind of allows everybody to
communicate together.

384
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,100
You,
you can have your twitter account and

385
00:18:55,101 --> 00:19:00,020
your facebook and all that jazz.
I feel like what's gonna happen with

386
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:04,640
this kind of technology and this sort of
hive mind technology.

387
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,570
It's if they can transmit signals from
one person to another person through the

388
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:12,740
brain with with this technology.

389
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,280
This is real similar to like when they
first started putting things on message

390
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:22,210
boards and the Internet and bulletin
boards and like someone would put it up

391
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:25,330
and then you'd have to check it and that
was the only method of communication.

392
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,700
Like my friend Andrew's talked to me
about that a lot.

393
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:32,701
He was on in the really early days of
the Internet and those se bulletin

394
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:37,810
boards were really primitive and this is
one of the first things that people had

395
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:41,530
devised to communicate with online,
but now here we are 20 years later and

396
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:45,730
it's fucking,
you're streaming live on instagram and

397
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:49,270
you're doing facebook live and you know,
people are taking pictures

398
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:54,271
instantaneously uploading them and
they're gonna they're gonna be able to

399
00:19:54,311 --> 00:19:58,690
some way somewhere,
another allow us to interface with our

400
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,700
brain's the same way we interfaced using
these phones and using computers.

401
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,150
I was just a way,
if that happens,

402
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,043
would,
uh,

403
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,750
I mean,
I don't know how this work.

404
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,550
This obviously was a two way
communication.

405
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:16,630
They're both wanting it to happen.
In this scenario you're bringing up

406
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:17,590
like,
what if a,

407
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,470
you sent me a message I didn't want,
I will or I didn't want to have right

408
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:22,270
then I didn't want.
Right now I'm busy,

409
00:20:22,271 --> 00:20:25,960
I'm doing something else.
Or You just blasting me with this

410
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:26,480
message.
Like,

411
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,020
hey,
hey,

412
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,750
hey,
wake up,

413
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,020
wake up.
I'm going to come to sleep.

414
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:32,730
Or who knows what's going on,
or I'm getting 10 messages from all

415
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,690
over.
I'm getting spam messages from outside

416
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,880
too because they're going to be a way to
turn it off.

417
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,370
Well,
I mean we're probably going to be able

418
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:42,860
to opt out of it,
but how many people are going to opt out

419
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:43,460
of it?
Like,

420
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,010
and even if you do,
maybe you could turn it off airplane

421
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:46,844
mode,
you know,

422
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,100
and like you do what your phone

423
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,550
at night if you're watching a TV show or
something.

424
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,210
I think that if you're,
if you're really gonna keep going with

425
00:20:57,461 --> 00:21:02,461
this and it seems like they're gonna.
I mean if they're doing things like

426
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:04,480
this,
it's not going to stop right there.

427
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,670
It's not going well.
We did it.

428
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,610
That's awesome.
Let's just leave it there.

429
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,410
No,
there they have these new batteries.

430
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,100
Have you seen these new fucking
batteries that uh,

431
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,970
they're powering with nuclear waste?

432
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,223
No.

433
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,460
Yeah,
the last for like 5,000 years.

434
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,450
I did see that Tesla's factory got
turned on and they started making

435
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,620
batteries.
Oh really?

436
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,400
Yeah.
There was something about batteries

437
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:32,170
being made with nuclear waste.

438
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,280
Um,

439
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,630
diamond battery made from nuclear ladies
can last more than 5,000 years.

440
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,720
Oh yeah.
Put that in a cell phone and put it

441
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:51,580
right next to your Dick.
That shouldn't hurt him at all because

442
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:54,610
radioactive sources in case safely
within the diamond,

443
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:57,490
the hardest known substance it would be
safe to use.

444
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,680
Say the researchers.
Fuck those guys.

445
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,190
They're going to open up a port to hell.
Those guys from halflife.

446
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,240
Fuck you man.
Fuck you.

447
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,000
You're going to put what?
And you know the chicks are going to

448
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:14,350
want God damn nuclear diamond.
You know those really super fucking high

449
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:17,050
maintenance checks.
They're all gonna want nuclear diamonds,

450
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,600
like a regular diamonds.
Not going to be good enough.

451
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,670
That's going to be the next top level
shit is a diamond with nuclear waste

452
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:29,671
inside of it.
You see this a cremation diamonds.

453
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:32,550
People are being cremated and turned
into diamonds.

454
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,940
Yeah.
Wonderful.

455
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,270
So what that those two things possibly
related.

456
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,020
It's cremations.
Weird ways and you were probably fucked

457
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,740
can over nature by being cremated.
We really are.

458
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,310
We're probably fucking over nature also
with a formaldehyde.

459
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,170
You know,
I mean there's some,

460
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,920
that's probably one of the disconnects
that we have with nature,

461
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,030
like we don't absorb into it anymore.
We don't,

462
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,120
we don't,
we don't just bury our dead and then let

463
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:05,450
the body do its natural decomposing
process and then become a part of the

464
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,760
natural ecosystem.
Now we've completely removed ourselves

465
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:11,560
from it.
We take the body,

466
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:16,561
we drain all the shit out of it.
We fill it up with chemicals we spray.

467
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,110
Painted is weird man.
Have you seen a body like that's about

468
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:20,944
to be buried?

469
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,440
Not for awhile,
but yeah,

470
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,840
my grandpa freaked me out

471
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,751
cause I was like,
wow,

472
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:29,220
he's not there.
Like,

473
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:31,290
this is weird.
It didn't,

474
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,290
it wasn't.
There was nothing good about it.

475
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,960
It was nothing good about being there
like that.

476
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:41,520
It was,
I don't want to use the words grotesque,

477
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,120
but there is something severely damaged
about the idea behind it.

478
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:50,940
It was like,
oh my God.

479
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:55,670
I felt like I was watching some crazy
ritualistic shit.

480
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,480
You know,
that was like reenacted from the

481
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,210
primitive days of early man.
I mean,

482
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:06,730
looking down at this spray painted shell
of a human,

483
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,410
it's just,
it's bizarre man.

484
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,360
Uh,
you could tell that's not.

485
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,690
He's not really there.
What is this?

486
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,970
These are different funerals.
What does it say?

487
00:24:17,971 --> 00:24:20,610
Puerto Rican gangster.
Puerto Rico gangster.

488
00:24:20,611 --> 00:24:23,400
Propped up playing dominoes at his
funeral.

489
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,120
Oh God.
As Superhero.

490
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,620
Oh my God.
This guy's in a car.

491
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,790
Jesus Christ.
This is crazy.

492
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,310
I've seen.
I've had like different disguises.

493
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:39,060
Here's a boxer.
Oh my God.

494
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,360
He's a boxer.
So they put him in his

495
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,050
warm up suit and they put them in a
corner of a ring.

496
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,150
Jesus Christ.
This is crazy.

497
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,370
He's got sunglasses on.
I want you have sunglasses and you read

498
00:24:51,371 --> 00:24:55,260
about the fight and
want to see a crazy fucking picture.

499
00:24:55,261 --> 00:25:00,261
That Guy Joseph Smith Jr who just
knocked out Bernard Hopkins first day on

500
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:05,571
the job since he won the world title and
he's got a photo of themselves,

501
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,810
a Gi Joe Smith Jr.

502
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,760
He's got to.
He's got two instagrams where I saw it.

503
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,030
Maybe cHabad it up.
Yeah,

504
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:24,070
there it is.
Look at that.

505
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,610
Joe smith's first day on the job.
Since he one.

506
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,710
I mean,
this guy just knocked out bernard

507
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:32,680
hopkins and he has a construction worker
job.

508
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:35,350
it's crazy.
It's insane.

509
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,810
that's insane.

510
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,600
Hey dude,
quit that job.

511
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,490
As I say,
do you think at this point he needs to

512
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:44,560
do that?
I don't know how much you got paid,

513
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,720
you know,
he might just be a and have another

514
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:48,760
fight lined up or.
Yeah,

515
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,780
I mean,
I think everyone would just assume that

516
00:25:52,781 --> 00:25:54,970
if someone's world champion that they're
rIch,

517
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,720
but it's not really the case.
You have to be a famous world champion.

518
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,311
the real,
the money.

519
00:26:00,311 --> 00:26:02,680
I Mean the money's in promotion.
The money is in,

520
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,840
you know,
a guy like oscar de la hoya in his

521
00:26:04,841 --> 00:26:07,000
prime.
He was a,

522
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:12,030
like a teen idol and also an amazing
boxer or olympiC gold medalist that

523
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:15,640
kinda guy sold tickets.
Floyd mayweather sells tickets.

524
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:19,810
Mandy pack out sells tickets
now.

525
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,970
Joe smith jr.
His next fight will probably make a lot

526
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:22,990
of money.
You know,

527
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,950
this was an opportunity for him and he
capitalized on it and he knocked out one

528
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:29,740
of the greatest of all time,
but it was

529
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,930
just weird to see them working.
You know,

530
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,210
that fight was fucked though.
I know what rounded that happened in

531
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,560
like the fourth or the fifth,
I don't remember.

532
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,180
But uh,
he had,

533
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,340
he had been getting to bernard hopkins
and it looked like one of those classic

534
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:54,300
fights where the old veteran just as
lost a step,

535
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,400
You know,
he was getting to bernard hopkins,

536
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,060
he tagged when some big shots and then
when he got him in the corner and just

537
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:03,330
unloaded those shots on him and then
bernard fell back on his head.

538
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,441
I was Like,
god,

539
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:08,730
this is just so fucked up.
It's just such a fucked up way to end an

540
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:13,440
amazing career.
Dan is just what that sport does,

541
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,770
does what that sport does.
There's no getting around that.

542
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:22,070
If you're a 51 year old band and you're
trying to fight one of the best young

543
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,640
lions in the game.

544
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,420
Especially,
he's not on pds or anything.

545
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:28,930
He's not on any.
I don't.

546
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:30,000
I mean,
I don't think he is.

547
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,980
He might be.
I doubt it.

548
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:36,570
He seems like Just a super disciplined
guy and his body sort of reflectS that.

549
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,030
He doesn't quite have the same body that
he had when he was younger,

550
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:41,610
but he still looked very fit.
Like when he was younger,

551
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:45,000
he was a savage.
I mean when he beat like felix trinidad,

552
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,640
nobody gave him a chance.
Everybody thought he was done.

553
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,550
They thought he was old.
I feel extremely.

554
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,330
That was going to fuck him up.
And he went on to fight for like 13 more

555
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:55,164
years.

556
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,431
Yeah,
man,

557
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:00,810
he fucked up.
Kelly pavlock,

558
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:04,800
they thought he was old.
Then he went to fight kelly pavlick and

559
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:05,401
everybody's like,
oh,

560
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:07,500
this is going to be a bad fight for
bernard hopkins.

561
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:08,280
You know,
he's,

562
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,040
you know,
I think he was 39 or something like

563
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,180
that.
I forget how old he was.

564
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,103
I remember.
That.

565
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,670
Might've been a little younger than
that.

566
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,110
Anyway,
he fucked up.

567
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,490
Kelly pavlik.
No,

568
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:22,491
he was in his forties.
Find out how old bernard hopkins was

569
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:26,700
when he fought kelly pavlik after
pavlock had already become the champ.

570
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:27,660
Right?
Yeah.

571
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,420
I want to say he pavlock had beaten
jermaine taylor.

572
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:38,330
Right.
And I think man,

573
00:28:38,331 --> 00:28:40,400
hopkins might've been 40 years old at
the time,

574
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,880
cause it's just,
you stop and think about boxers.

575
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:50,050
In the paSt there was a few guys like
archie moore,

576
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,120
George Foreman,
he was 43 and 26.

577
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,590
That's crazy.
And almost 10 years later he's trying to

578
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:05,591
still do that with these murderous white
men because kelly pavlock was a

579
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:09,560
murderous white dude to murderous
puncher.

580
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,610
And then thIs,
uh,

581
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:14,660
Joe Smith juniors at ferocious puncher
or he's just a killer.

582
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,650
Bernard hopkins,
like you got a one thing you gotta give

583
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:21,200
the guy is amazing as his career has
been.

584
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,030
Even at the very last fight,
he takes the toughest fight he can find

585
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,710
or one of the toughest ones.

586
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,930
Just a real young dangerous kid.
But it just,

587
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,560
even though like we've seen it happen
with sugar ray leonard,

588
00:29:36,561 --> 00:29:37,340
we saw it.
I mean,

589
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,920
remember when sugar ray leonard got beat
up by hector camacho.

590
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,020
I just in long.
And hector camacho just beat the shit

591
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:44,831
out of him.
And it's like,

592
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:46,930
wow,
this is weird to watch.

593
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,110
And he had billy blanks in his corner.
Billy blanks,

594
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,570
teaching them tibo
dead.

595
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,930
He had billy blanks.
Billy blanks is a karate champion too.

596
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,160
He was a yoke dude,
and you know,

597
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,200
knows a lot aBout fitness,
but apparently triggered something

598
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:05,350
fucked up with his calf,
like you pulled a muscle in his calf.

599
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,410
Then he had to get a cortisone shot
before the fight.

600
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,600
He had like a little bit of a limp.
I remember would Hector camacho fucked

601
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:16,930
him up?
But the really scary one was Terry

602
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,240
Norris when Terry Norris beat up sugar
ray leonard.

603
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,420
Do you remember that?
Terry norris jr

604
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,980
does.
Terry norris.

605
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:31,060
He put a beating on a lot of dudes.
He was a scary kid

606
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,860
when he was at his best terry noises
like lightning.

607
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,700
Yeah.
This is when Terry Norris was,

608
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,590
you know,
world class and he was just a step

609
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,270
faster than sugar ray.
And you could see he's getting into him.

610
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,730
Terry norris,
he had been knocked out a few times

611
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:57,280
himself to man.
He got gotten the war is one of the

612
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,470
exciting things about norris was that he
would,

613
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,200
he would get hit,
he would get in front of guys and he

614
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:03,034
would,
you know,

615
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,620
really take some risks and one of the
reasons why he was so fun to watch,

616
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,450
but yeah,
this is just,

617
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,300
I don't even remember exactly how this
fight ends,

618
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:20,920
but I'm pretty sure terry stopped him.
Oh,

619
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,610
this is just round seven.
I thought it was a highlight or.

620
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,600
Oh no.
Oh yeah.

621
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,920
They got knocked down.
Yeah.

622
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,780
See when you see shit like that,
like,

623
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:33,570
whoa.
See him,

624
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,690
get up staggered.

625
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,110
We've seen this so many times.
It shouldn't.

626
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,480
It shouldn't be weird at all.
Oh,

627
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:44,810
what a good time for the internet to
freeze.

628
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:53,310
It shouldn't be a confusing to us,
but it's just some.

629
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,850
It's this story that repeats itself over
and over and over again.

630
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,910
It doesn't seem like anybody ever learns
their lesson.

631
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:04,600
There's a few guys that get out on top,
lIke if I really do hope,

632
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:07,000
floyd mayweather says fuck you to
everybody.

633
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,210
It just takes all that money.
I really do hope he does that.

634
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,860
I would love to see a guy get through
the whole thing without ever getting

635
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:18,070
fucked up once,
like I mean if you think about what he's

636
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:22,000
done,
made stupid amounts of money and got

637
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:26,080
through the whole thing,
might have gotten her three or four

638
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:29,170
times and it's whole career.
Might have gotten tagged,

639
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,720
never got beat up,
never got knocked out.

640
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,190
Just get tagged a few times over the
course of how many fights.

641
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,220
I mean,
that's beautiful.

642
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,070
Someone can do

643
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,700
that.
That's like retiring as a bmx rider with

644
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:47,330
no broken bones.
Is that possible to do?

645
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,313
I don't think that.

646
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,610
No.
Yeah.

647
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,920
See what,
what he's done.

648
00:32:52,921 --> 00:32:57,390
If floyd mayweather retires,
he's done the thing that nobody ever

649
00:32:57,391 --> 00:33:01,590
does.
He went out on top undefeated with all

650
00:33:01,591 --> 00:33:06,440
the money after having fought all
challengers mean he might've fought pack

651
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,250
y'all late,
but you can't deny that he fought all

652
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:09,084
challengers.

653
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,260
Hooky as fuck.
I mean the 50 things seems to be an

654
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:17,660
issue or not an issue.
Forty to 50.

655
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,210
You know,
whether or not he wants to break the

656
00:33:19,211 --> 00:33:22,000
record.
I mean how much of that as his ego.

657
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,500
That's gonna last for.
I mean,

658
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,580
he's still pretty young,
right?

659
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,030
Yeah.
I mean he's,

660
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,050
I think he's 36 if I had a gas,
but he's in really good shape.

661
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,600
I mean he takes care of himself really
well.

662
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,080
He's notoriously disciplined about
workouts and he'll even go out at night,

663
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,210
go to a nightclub,
drink water,

664
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,380
and then work out at 2:00 in the morning
because he has his own gym and his own

665
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:50,381
thing and he and he works hard.
You don't get that good on just talent.

666
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,090
You know,
you get that good on talent and

667
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:56,540
discipline and hard fucking work.
There's just no way around it.

668
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,880
And smart.
You've got to be smart too.

669
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,890
You got to be sneaky.
You got to be clever.

670
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:01,940
Do you see,
uh,

671
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,560
who is training right now for a fight?

672
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,130
Yeah.
He's a trained soldier.

673
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:10,131
Boy,
soldier boy is really going to fight

674
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:12,000
chris brown.
Is that real?

675
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,883
I don't.
I mean,

676
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,670
it doesn't seem like it,
but it's been talked about for a few

677
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,550
days now.
Apparently it's going to be on paper

678
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:20,120
view.
Um,

679
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,340
and fighting over a girl.
Don't.

680
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,070
I'm going to tell you right now,
chris brown is gonna fuck him up.

681
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:25,963
Probably.

682
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,160
Yeah.
That's an angry dude that.

683
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:29,460
See,
that dude is on the left with the red.

684
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,290
That's a real angry dude.
The other dude,

685
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,750
I just do not think he is angry,

686
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,933
but knows,
man,

687
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,620
I've never seen either of them
personally know

688
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,090
one of them.
Maybe soulja boy's been hide some sick

689
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:48,330
boxing skills and just pretending this
whole time,

690
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,600
I doubt it.
See,

691
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:52,210
I feel like chris brown is probably
punched a lot more people,

692
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,910
you know,
don't you think?

693
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,810
I don't know.
All,

694
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,510
you know,
wife beating girl beating jokes aside.

695
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,190
He's definitely seems like a dude who is
much more likely to punch people.

696
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,540
Um,
maybe,

697
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,930
maybe more likely to,
but I couldn't really see neither either

698
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:10,640
of them getting in like a street fight
or anything.

699
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:15,350
They've been pretty famous for most of
their life and pretending to hm.

700
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,660
Interesting.
Since they're in their teens,

701
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,320
um,
two guys,

702
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,580
shit happens.
So I mean they might have thrown some

703
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,130
darn down once or twice.
Oh

704
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,120
boy.
Here's another thing.

705
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:27,830
Here's another reason why I say chris
brown.

706
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,530
Chris brown is a real fucking dancer
here.

707
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,800
See that guy move?
Oh yeah,

708
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,160
yeah.
He could do some crazy shit.

709
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,890
He's really good In basketball.
Basketball.

710
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,670
Listen,
this is going to be a bloodbath.

711
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,410
I might be wrong.
What'd you buy it?

712
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,530
Yeah,
I'll fucking buy it.

713
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,070
You know.
And if a soldier boy fucks him up,

714
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:51,060
I'll,
I'll apologize.

715
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,930
Have a.
I was trying to think about this.

716
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:54,550
Hasn't there been other things?
I mean,

717
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:57,010
I know you were supposedly supposed to
fight wesley snipes,

718
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:59,620
but like wasn't there other things like
this ever happen?

719
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,260
The whole celebrity boxing show.
I remember That happened a couple times.

720
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,090
Yeah.
Danny bonaduce fought screech.

721
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,930
Um,
he fucked up a couple of people.

722
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,840
I remember when I was younger,
there were supposed to be a big event

723
00:36:11,841 --> 00:36:15,140
where shaquille o'neal was supposed to
go one on one on pay per view with this

724
00:36:15,141 --> 00:36:17,930
other big player named chemo chemo one
box.

725
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,520
Not box.
They were going to come play basketball

726
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:22,160
one on one for a million dollars,
but it never ended up happening.

727
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,860
I don't know wHy.
Oh,

728
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,470
it went away,
but I was just kinD of wondering in my

729
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:30,380
head like I feel like this is how I've
heard things like this coming up and

730
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:31,820
have like,
or at least been announced,

731
00:36:31,821 --> 00:36:33,050
but that just kind of fizzle out.

732
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,540
Who knows,
man,

733
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,540
I mean,
people have done crazy shit.

734
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,920
This just seems like a really,
really nutty one and they're fighting

735
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:45,020
over a girl.
I just.

736
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,590
Have you seen any evidence of soldier
boy's athleticism?

737
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,350
He,
somebody put up a video of him working

738
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:54,080
out.
There's a compilation of him working

739
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:54,930
out.
It's,

740
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,110
but it's hard to tell if he's just being
silly,

741
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,310
you know?
I was like,

742
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,390
he's a,
he's shadow boxing and he's riding an

743
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:05,780
elliptical machine.
He seems like a really young guy.

744
00:37:05,781 --> 00:37:06,614
How old is he?

745
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,690
Man?
In his twenties still too.

746
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:12,850
He's in his twenties.

747
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,743
Yeah.

748
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,970
Well there's,
there's a bunch of this complication

749
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,520
here is so
whoever they do,

750
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:26,810
that was it.
He was like,

751
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,520
oh man.
He goes,

752
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:33,830
you're working out with your socks on.
This is not the same compilation,

753
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,660
but it was pretty funny.
He's like,

754
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,350
only real savages.
Workout with their socks off.

755
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,330
I don't know,
man,

756
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,270
it's just,
you know,

757
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,590
why do they want to do this?
There's two,

758
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,380
I don't know,
they need a hug it out.

759
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,450
When you were talking about that black
mirror episode,

760
00:37:55,451 --> 00:37:56,710
I forgot.
That's the one that you saw.

761
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,430
Uh,
one of the things I actually got on and

762
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,540
was seeing shown at this seat.
Yes.

763
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:05,650
Event was that I showed it to the other
night that gopro gimbal I got.

764
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:10,730
It's called the a karma grip,
lets you hold onto it.

765
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:15,900
I'll see it if you want,
but this is some of the video I shot

766
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:16,490
with it.

767
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,780
And so the idea is that it balances
itself.

768
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,740
Put the camera,
the camera's on you.

769
00:38:20,741 --> 00:38:23,230
So like you just kind of hold it and it
keeps itself stem stable.

770
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:26,680
So like as you can jiggle it around a
little bit and it stays pretty simple.

771
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:30,490
And this was me walking around.
I have it at two to a double speed here.

772
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,130
But this was connected to my shoulder
basically.

773
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,653
And I was walking.

774
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,940
So you taped it to shoulder?
Uh,

775
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,540
I had a velcro strap
like this.

776
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:43,560
I had a brown my backpack.

777
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,900
And so I was just kind of like walking
around the event and here's one of the,

778
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:51,380
here's one of the cool things I did see
at the event too was a projector that's

779
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,660
projecting on,
um,

780
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,520
it's,
it's the stabilization actually

781
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,100
stay up,
but this,

782
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:06,520
uh,
this projector right here is projecting

783
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,790
onto a curtain,
which I kind of ran past it pretty fast.

784
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:11,650
I wasn't really shooting my video for
that purpose,

785
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:12,160
but

786
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,830
let's take a shower curtain with like a
pattern on it.

787
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,290
Yeah.
But it's showing a solid image on that.

788
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,020
Exactly.
It's showing a hockey game and you're

789
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:22,890
not seeing the ripples,
so you don't need a flat screen for this

790
00:39:22,891 --> 00:39:24,750
projector.
You can project it on anything.

791
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:28,440
And I got three exactly.
Or ideally you would want something a

792
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:29,580
little smoother than that.
But yeah,

793
00:39:29,581 --> 00:39:31,140
you could still have a flat image on
that.

794
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,030
So,
uh,

795
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,280
that was pretty neat.
But some of this video is pretty cool on

796
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:38,370
the stabilization.
And then I went over to the samsung

797
00:39:38,371 --> 00:39:41,820
booth and they have what they're kind of
showing here.

798
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:46,821
Is this stuff flat flat hanging tv.
Which different.

799
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,170
Only way it's different from the things
now as like when you hang a tv up on a

800
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:54,180
wall,
it's kind of hanging off about four to

801
00:39:54,181 --> 00:39:56,790
six inches.
This is literally flat.

802
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,880
Don't know if you can see right there.
Yeah,

803
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,560
it looks like I couldn't get very close
paper.

804
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,520
Yeah,
but you can't really.

805
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:04,010
I don't know if you could slide anything
in there.

806
00:40:04,011 --> 00:40:07,800
It says it's a no gap wall mount and
then there's really no cords hanging off

807
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:09,630
of there either.
It's one cord.

808
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,420
No htmi.
I don't even know if power was coming

809
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:15,390
off of it either.
It then one optical cord.

810
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:18,750
So it's like using light optical cables.
Use light waves.

811
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,120
So the one chord is powering it and
providing the data.

812
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,020
See it says invisible connection right
there on top.

813
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:27,490
It's showing some of the data.

814
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,870
Well,
it kind of makes sense.

815
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,720
What would they can do now with these
power?

816
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,170
I should say

817
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,190
set a power.
It hasn't,

818
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,830
but it does.
Do all the four k data does the htmi in

819
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,080
every place has all of that.

820
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,240
But with these new iphones,
with that,

821
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:43,860
uh,
what is that connection connecting

822
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,810
lightning connector,
that connector,

823
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,790
you use it for sound like.
Well,

824
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:48,630
your earplugs.
Yep.

825
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:51,180
Your era earbuds,
you use it for,

826
00:40:51,181 --> 00:40:52,560
um,
an external microphone.

827
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,980
You can use it for the charges if you
could split it off so it charges it at

828
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:01,830
the same time.
You're also listening to music so both

829
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:03,150
things can go through at the same time.

830
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,680
Um,
another interesting thing that was being

831
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:09,380
shown is some transparent,
uh,

832
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,120
lcd screens.
So I'm trying to say this one a little

833
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:15,760
bit.
This one right here in the middle,

834
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,210
discuss trying to show you.
This screen right here is actually a

835
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:24,100
full lcd screen pointing at the corner,
but there's an art display shown over

836
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:26,650
top of it,
like an eight ink art display.

837
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,440
So when you're not using it,
when you're not using the tv,

838
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,560
it looks like a piece of art hanging on
your wall with the rest of the art.

839
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,840
Wow.
Oh,

840
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,280
so it's a screensaver,

841
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,870
basically a screensaver.
That's insane.

842
00:41:39,871 --> 00:41:44,250
And there were a couple other companies
showing some seethrough lcd screens that

843
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,070
great idea white.
These are all,

844
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,230
still haven't come to market yet,
but this is some of the stuff that

845
00:41:49,231 --> 00:41:50,064
they're showing.

846
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,320
It's so beautiful too.
That's beautiful artwork and if you can

847
00:41:53,321 --> 00:41:55,060
do it with that kind of resolution.

848
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,940
I'm here.
I was just,

849
00:41:57,941 --> 00:41:59,860
I looked at some three d,
so the curved,

850
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,010
curved,
uh,

851
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,400
monitors.
This is like the most curved monitor

852
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:06,070
ever.
I'm still not super sold on these.

853
00:42:06,071 --> 00:42:11,071
I don't really understand why everyone
or why they're selling them so hard.

854
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:14,560
I don't really have an interest in
buying when I've tried a few times to

855
00:42:14,561 --> 00:42:15,350
look at it,
but

856
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:18,650
it's very gimmicky.
It seems to me like,

857
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:20,960
um,
remember when those three d tvs were

858
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:23,330
coming out and everyone was trying to
convince everybody you need to get it.

859
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,810
Three d tvs coming and I've watched it
for like a couple of minutes with the

860
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:27,740
glasses on.
I was like,

861
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:29,900
this is not going to work.
This is not here yet.

862
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,530
Know it's just two goofy that's gone.
Pretty much gone.

863
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,420
I think that's the same with these
things.

864
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,450
I think people are,
you're going to use them for awhile then

865
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:39,740
you're going to go with.
But this is,

866
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:41,300
why is it,
why am I doing this?

867
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,160
Why am I curving the fucking

868
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,530
screen?
It seems like it's only for one viewer

869
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:47,150
too.
Cause if your curve and it's for the

870
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:48,280
other people,
then they can't.

871
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,890
It's fucks it up for everybody else.
It makes it to one person.

872
00:42:50,891 --> 00:42:55,750
But I would say the majority of people's
use of computers is probably one person.

873
00:42:55,751 --> 00:42:56,584
Right,

874
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,201
right.
Yeah,

875
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:58,880
for sure.
At least one person at a time.

876
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,980
So in this video you can also see kind
of how crowded this whole event was to.

877
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,080
Is.
This is a.

878
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,500
I walked 25 miles,
I think my,

879
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,800
my fitbit tracked 25 miles in two days.
Wow.

880
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:14,760
And that was the only six to seven hours
per time that tired after that.

881
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,111
Yeah.
Dude,

882
00:43:16,111 --> 00:43:18,870
you had a workout for sure.
And I was carrying around a backpack,

883
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:23,340
a pounds of gear in it.
But here's an interesting new laptop

884
00:43:23,341 --> 00:43:26,250
coming out.
You can't really get a good view on it.

885
00:43:26,251 --> 00:43:28,980
I kind of picked it up.
It's literally,

886
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,670
I think it weighs less than a pound or
right around a pound.

887
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,870
And it felt like a,
like a kid's toy.

888
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:40,340
That's how the plasticky it did,
I don't want to say it felt cheap,

889
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,650
but it felt like a toy.
It felt like you could just throw it

890
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:46,400
like a frisbee.
But it was a full laptop made by

891
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:47,480
samsung.
Uh,

892
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,830
and had an lcd screen.
I had a full keyboard,

893
00:43:49,831 --> 00:43:52,900
I had a mouse pad and they had a little,
uh,

894
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,030
I think it was a scale next to each
thing that just proved to you how much

895
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,864
it weighed.

896
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:01,230
But are you that much of a pussy that
you can carry around a one pound laptop?

897
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:04,080
Get it?
Yes and no,

898
00:44:04,081 --> 00:44:04,720
but I mean the safe.

899
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,370
If you want to take one hunting and you
need to,

900
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,280
you all your ounces like oh yeah,
well

901
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,980
definitely shouldn't take a laptop or
anything.

902
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,680
But if you did,
yeah,

903
00:44:12,681 --> 00:44:14,530
you would definitely want to do that.
Yeah.

904
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:19,080
Guys cut their toothbrushes in half.
There's a lot of like drastic weight

905
00:44:19,081 --> 00:44:22,590
reduction when it comes to those things.
But I just feel like for laptops it's

906
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:25,020
not that hard to carry one around and
you know,

907
00:44:25,021 --> 00:44:30,021
you put it on your back and to me like
features and a hard drive and

908
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,190
speed and that's the most important
shit.

909
00:44:34,191 --> 00:44:38,430
Like yeah,
it's not that hard to carry a pound or

910
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:40,690
two pounds or whatever the fuck it is.
Three pounds.

911
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:45,120
It's not that hard.
They haven't gotten that back crazy.

912
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:47,230
I guess they are getting all lighter.
Yeah.

913
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,030
Means that doesn't weigh that much.
Those retina displays are very light and

914
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:53,000
it's beautiful.
You know?

915
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:56,040
And then they have the heirs and those
are featherlite.

916
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,140
You don't need anything lighter than a
goddamn mac book.

917
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:00,420
Air sure that.
Nothing.

918
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,220
Nothing.
There's got to be a reason.

919
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:04,800
There's got to be a small market.
It also probably is way cheaper than a

920
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,240
macbook air.
I would have to say.

921
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,460
Well you remember when people want it
smaller and smaller phones,

922
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:12,750
we bias fullness that big.
I saw a phone once that like it was so

923
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:17,130
small that like there was a dial for.
I'm trying to remember how the fucking

924
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,020
numbers were pressed.

925
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:24,050
There was some novel way of like they
barely could fit a number pad like to

926
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,700
dial phone numbers,
so they had some weird dial thing to it.

927
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,090
Trying to remember just reminded me,
I might be making this up.

928
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,510
Iphone prototype.
It showed an iphone prototype.

929
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:38,250
I don't know how it came out today or
not today,

930
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:43,251
but this week someone made a or showed
video of how one of the ways in Iceland

931
00:45:45,061 --> 00:45:48,540
was supposed to originally work and it
was using that scroll wheel that used to

932
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:50,880
be on an eye on the old ipods.
Do remember that?

933
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:54,570
Yeah,
so someone kind of hacked it together.

934
00:45:54,571 --> 00:45:57,870
I think on a current iphone to show you
how this worked,

935
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:01,980
this operating system worked,
but it seemed like the aap obviously

936
00:46:01,981 --> 00:46:06,981
worst way ever to be controlling a phone
because even I think you would had to

937
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:09,780
input numbers that way by scrolling two,
three,

938
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,720
four seems so bad.

939
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,480
It was that really considered.
I mean it's work.

940
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,510
It's a working prototype,
so I'd have to say someone at least

941
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:20,310
thought it might've been a good idea.
Well,

942
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:24,480
it has to be that they went through a
bunch of different ideas before they

943
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:25,950
came up with the.
Yeah,

944
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,590
I mean I heard they're going through 10
different phones right now just to try

945
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:31,830
to figure out what the next iphone
they're going to go with this or 10

946
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,590
different testing models.
So do you think that they've hit that

947
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:39,591
point of critical mass where it's like
unless something really huge comes along

948
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,830
like a hologram projectors or something
really bananas,

949
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,860
you've got everything now you've got
amazing cameras,

950
00:46:46,861 --> 00:46:51,861
you've got massive hard drive space,
you've got so much you've got.

951
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,170
You have all these apps that you can
use.

952
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:58,140
You've got all this usability,
like what are you gonna do that's gonna

953
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:02,460
make people want like a next generation
and next generation and next generation.

954
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,880
Like there has to be some sort of a leap
because it seems like for all the

955
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:09,630
technology we have today,
people are almost like over computered

956
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,210
and an over phoned.
Right?

957
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,760
Definitely for sure.
I mean,

958
00:47:13,761 --> 00:47:15,690
I was trying to walk when I was walking
around that event,

959
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:19,610
I was looking for like either the big
crowds to see what everyone was like

960
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,610
stuck around looking at because this
event was so huge to,

961
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:26,360
to stop and spend five minutes at a,
at a particular,

962
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:30,010
I don't know,
a pod or product

963
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,300
or even just let someone talk to you to
take your time for that five minutes is

964
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:36,400
insane because there's just so much to
look at.

965
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,580
Um,
but at the same time,

966
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,810
well I kind of lost what I was doing
there,

967
00:47:42,811 --> 00:47:45,460
but um,
I just kind of looked over at this thing

968
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:49,450
I wanted to show you,
which was distinct called vertifi,

969
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:52,160
which is this three d virtual reality
program who,

970
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,000
um,
they showed this guy over here doing a

971
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:56,440
demo for it.
I didn't want to wait in line.

972
00:47:56,441 --> 00:47:58,510
I really didn't want to wait in any
lines there because there was so many

973
00:47:58,511 --> 00:48:02,900
people and I didn't feel very good to
stand somewhere for 30 minutes.

974
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:03,823
Sweat

975
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:06,450
young.
Jamie got the same stomach flu that I

976
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:07,284
had.

977
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,490
But uh,
what this shows right here is this.

978
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:12,750
I think I'm pretty sure that this thing
on top of yours to camera that records

979
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,950
the event.
Hmm.

980
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:16,960
Then what they were showing,
this guy was getting a demo of it,

981
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:20,980
which I wasn't seeing on this screen,
but they did show and you can kind of

982
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,810
see.
I'm pinching his hand up there on top

983
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,680
on this video.
They show you watching,

984
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,240
uh,
with a vr headset,

985
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,610
let's say a concert.
And then you can decide to grab the lead

986
00:48:32,611 --> 00:48:34,440
singer and move them into your living
room.

987
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,970
So the performance this now he's not,
I don't know,

988
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,250
it was real weird how it showed it and I
don't have it on this actual video.

989
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,690
I went back and watched another

990
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:46,660
and so he's wearing some fairly small
goggles.

991
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,550
It was not,
not a lot to what he's wearing.

992
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:49,421
Yeah.
That's one of the,

993
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:50,410
uh,
one.

994
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,810
There's about four or five big things
going on there.

995
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:57,130
There's vr headsets,
different new multiple companies sharing

996
00:48:57,131 --> 00:48:57,870
vr headsets.

997
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:01,110
Was this augmented or was it virtual
reality?

998
00:49:01,111 --> 00:49:03,150
Because I believe it was the virtual
reality,

999
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,140
but he reached up and grabbed someone,
pinched it and brought it in yet.

1000
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,840
But it would have to be a little
augmented because you were seeing it in

1001
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:11,910
your living room.
You'd have to also see the living room.

1002
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,770
Yeah.
If you go back to the video,

1003
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,190
you being there,
like see,

1004
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,980
like when you see his actual goggles
itself,

1005
00:49:19,981 --> 00:49:22,860
like watch ice pass by a little bit on
the can see it.

1006
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,030
See that's the lead singer.
Moved onto the couch.

1007
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,970
Just bringing the artists to our home.
How bizarre.

1008
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,690
Which would I.
I kind of like pulled into the comedy

1009
00:49:32,691 --> 00:49:34,130
world.
You could bring the comedian into your

1010
00:49:34,131 --> 00:49:36,170
living room and just have performed
performing your front and your living

1011
00:49:36,171 --> 00:49:39,650
room instead of at the comedy.
That venue that they were at,

1012
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,270
which would be interesting.

1013
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,203
Yeah.

1014
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,820
How odd.
Uh,

1015
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:51,030
drones was a big a big thing.
There are tons of drones now,

1016
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,020
right?
Tiny ones.

1017
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:55,740
There's this selfie drone which didn't
seem like it worked very well.

1018
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,530
It kept flying up and flying down
different sides.

1019
00:49:58,531 --> 00:49:59,700
I'm not quite sure how you're supposed
to do

1020
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,470
controlled.
Go.

1021
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:04,070
Go through this for a couple more
seconds to see that guy's a goggles

1022
00:50:04,071 --> 00:50:05,990
because I think he gets see through
them.

1023
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,730
See,
look how he's looking.

1024
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:09,350
Yeah.
Okay.

1025
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:14,350
See how you see his eyes.
I mean that's what it seems like to me.

1026
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:16,710
I have that microsoft surface.

1027
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,370
Oh sure.
And there's a behind it too as a

1028
00:50:22,371 --> 00:50:24,230
wireless vr headset.
So they were,

1029
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:26,270
like I said too,
there were a lot of headsets and there

1030
00:50:26,271 --> 00:50:29,600
are lots of things and let's.
Let me just throw out a number and say I

1031
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:34,370
did five tech demos out of those five,
two or three didn't work or that didn't

1032
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:36,740
go well or that didn't work perfectly at
all.

1033
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:40,240
So thAt's where I've kind of like,
I don't know that a lot of this stuff

1034
00:50:40,241 --> 00:50:43,420
wasn't maybe not ready or maybe it was
supposed to be shown that way.

1035
00:50:43,421 --> 00:50:44,254
And you're.
This is like,

1036
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,370
this is our only demo product we have
for you guys to see where it's supposed

1037
00:50:48,371 --> 00:50:50,380
to work all the time.
It usually does,

1038
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:53,260
but we've done so many demos today.
It kind of froze up a little bit.

1039
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,030
That could have been happening to a
little bit,

1040
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,270
but there is a lot of things going on
here where they're just trying to show

1041
00:50:58,271 --> 00:51:00,970
you some.
Show you an idea and hope someone with a

1042
00:51:00,971 --> 00:51:02,620
lot of money walks by and I was like,
ah,

1043
00:51:02,621 --> 00:51:04,230
that looks like a good idea here.
Some one kid

1044
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:06,650
go make it.
That kind of thing.

1045
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:10,370
Like some 19 thirties carnival barker
and know it works out for that.

1046
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:13,880
does that happen?
Are there lIke guys who troll around

1047
00:51:13,881 --> 00:51:17,230
this place and look for a.
I saw products.

1048
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,290
I just walked by.

1049
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,870
Oh,
the intel booth and randomly saw a guy

1050
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:22,700
will walk up to one of their workers and
say like,

1051
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:25,250
I have some patents on baseball,
wifi technology,

1052
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:26,084
who do I talk?

1053
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,380
That kind of thing.
So that's all.

1054
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:30,530
there's tons of different meetings.
Things sorting are happening by the way,

1055
00:51:30,531 --> 00:51:32,630
in case anybody misinterprets what I'm
saying.

1056
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,810
Troll around.
I don't mean like a fuck with people on

1057
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:38,660
the internet troll.
I mean like fishing troll.

1058
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,870
when you drag a line behind you go look
for things to catch.

1059
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,790
Do you think that um,
this,

1060
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:49,850
this was like the big thing in this ces
though as far as emerging technologies

1061
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:52,100
with all this virtual reality stuff

1062
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,020
every year it is a.
Apparently it's focused on something

1063
00:51:57,021 --> 00:51:59,230
different.
Like this year there wasn't very much

1064
00:51:59,231 --> 00:52:02,440
cell phone,
anything really and used in the past

1065
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,150
years,
like there's been big announcements of

1066
00:52:04,151 --> 00:52:08,420
cell phones from different companies.
I think I only even solid maybe one and

1067
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,670
it was this company called highway,
I believe it's how you say it because

1068
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,580
they had a,
they paired with this a really well

1069
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,950
known camera company called leica and
have a 20 megapixel camera.

1070
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:23,230
They make binoculars and stuff too.
Um,

1071
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:28,420
but I tested that out to see how good it
was and I wasn't sure if I was holding

1072
00:52:28,421 --> 00:52:31,030
the actual correct model,
which was the one that had all the best

1073
00:52:31,031 --> 00:52:33,730
features in it because I had a couple of
different models out there.

1074
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:38,140
So much going on there.
It was really hard to get a grasp of

1075
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,250
what you were doing.

1076
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,050
That's really interesting.
You bring this up.

1077
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:46,060
It's making me think like when you get
to a certain level of this virtual

1078
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:48,580
reality stuff,
you're gonna want to look through like

1079
00:52:48,581 --> 00:52:51,140
the best lens available.
You know,

1080
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:55,360
you're gonna want one of those high end
binocular companies to come along and

1081
00:52:55,361 --> 00:52:56,320
craft something.

1082
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

1083
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:01,200
I'm trying to remember right now.
I want to say it's gopro.

1084
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:03,850
I'll have to google it for.
I kind of say something off,

1085
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:05,380
but do you know,
have you heard of the company called

1086
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:06,880
hasselblad?
Yes,

1087
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:07,730
I believe,
yeah.

1088
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,460
Go camera company that they were the
people that uh,

1089
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,250
had the cameras that they put on the
moon.

1090
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:13,900
Yeah,
I think it's dji,

1091
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:19,030
dji mobile.
Allegedly they were on the moon.

1092
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:24,080
Yeah.
So dji is a arguably the best drone

1093
00:53:24,241 --> 00:53:25,680
maker right now.
They're biggest company.

1094
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:28,710
It's a company come out of China.
They make a,

1095
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,870
the phantom,
which was,

1096
00:53:30,871 --> 00:53:34,690
uh,
the biggest consumer drone and right now

1097
00:53:34,691 --> 00:53:36,190
they just put out the thing called the
maverick,

1098
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:38,860
which is.
So they acquired hassle bad.

1099
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:41,650
Apparently they had a minor stake in the
company and they just took a major

1100
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:45,230
stake.
So they just took over the stockholding

1101
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,120
what's the correct pronunciation?
It's hassle bland.

1102
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,983
I believe so,
yeah.

1103
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,110
So dgi is this,
they made this thing called the

1104
00:53:53,111 --> 00:53:54,970
maverick,
which I got to hold up the event.

1105
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,060
I didn't get the buy one.
They're not there on backorder still

1106
00:53:58,061 --> 00:53:59,950
right now.
They've been there for a little while

1107
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,160
folded up because each of these legs
folds together.

1108
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:08,970
It's a a little bit smaller,
a little bit bigger than this than my

1109
00:54:08,971 --> 00:54:13,020
iphone seven s a little bit thicker.
You can see that sticker,

1110
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,780
but the actual size you can hold it and
it's about same size as the palm of your

1111
00:54:17,781 --> 00:54:19,070
hand.
HolY shit.

1112
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,010
And it shoots four k video.
It goes up to,

1113
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,170
I want to say for about four miles away
from you.

1114
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,230
Yeah,
so you'd obvIously you're going to lose

1115
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:29,840
sight of it and it goes to I think 20,
30,

1116
00:54:29,841 --> 00:54:34,400
40 miles an hour or something like that.
Something crazy and this is a bite sized

1117
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:39,650
god.
Does it avoid avoid things or obstacle

1118
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,540
avoidance?
That's what these cameras on the front

1119
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,490
floor.
There's some on the back or the bottom

1120
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:46,200
too,
so they have another versIon which is

1121
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:49,030
the phantom four.
A pro I believe,

1122
00:54:49,031 --> 00:54:51,750
which is a bigger version than this.
They have an inspired,

1123
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:54,820
which is the way bigger version and then
they have like the full film,

1124
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:59,100
like a film company would use,
which has got like eight big crazy props

1125
00:54:59,101 --> 00:54:59,790
on it and whatnot.

1126
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:01,920
Do you remember when they filmed that
movie?

1127
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:05,490
The twilight zone and they didn't have
drones back then.

1128
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:10,160
They had a helicopter and actual real
helicopter behind them doing a stunt.

1129
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:12,620
which

1130
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,510
do you remember that there was a
horrible accident?

1131
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,341
Um,
man,

1132
00:55:16,341 --> 00:55:20,510
it was a horrible accident where the
actor in this little girl were killed.

1133
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,370
Oh wait.
The helicopter came crashing down on

1134
00:55:24,371 --> 00:55:26,140
them that you said that there was two
people.

1135
00:55:26,141 --> 00:55:28,360
I think I did hear about it.
Don't even show me this dude.

1136
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:32,650
I don't even want to watch that shit.
We can try.

1137
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,840
I didn't see it.
Something.

1138
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,073
Something about

1139
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,880
seeing people die for a movie too.
It's like particularly gruesome.

1140
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:45,850
It's like why?
How did you think that you could just

1141
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,250
fly that helicopter right next to
people?

1142
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,380
Hm.
Well,

1143
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,140
with all this drone stuff,
I'm able to kind of asked you this

1144
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:57,740
question because I don't know if it's an
actual trend I see happening or if it's

1145
00:55:57,741 --> 00:56:01,040
just something they're forcing or what,
but there's just seems to be a lot of,

1146
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:04,080
uh,
camera equipment being made available

1147
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:08,730
for the individual to use to make really
high end stuff.

1148
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,600
And I don't know if it's the trend that
people were just going to start making

1149
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:15,610
all this content.
Are they gonna just start shooting

1150
00:56:15,611 --> 00:56:18,440
everything they're doing?
Are they just making it as technology

1151
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:22,200
and allowing that to happen for us?
Well,

1152
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,000
it seems like there's only so much you
can do with it.

1153
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:33,320
I feel like what would they have to do
though is have the best shit.

1154
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,180
So thing if someone has four k you have
to have four k,

1155
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,120
you know,
someone has um,

1156
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:40,790
you know,
virtual capability,

1157
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,370
you could upload it digitally.

1158
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:45,390
It's like fitness trackers were really
big there.

1159
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:47,263
I still,
I,

1160
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,290
I don't remember who it was that came in
here.

1161
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:51,300
I think it was the first time burke came
in with one.

1162
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,720
I sort of tried to ask him,
I was like [inaudible].

1163
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,070
I had one too for a couple of weeks,
but it took it back because it got

1164
00:56:56,071 --> 00:56:57,480
recalled,
but I was like,

1165
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:00,590
what are you doing with that?
The one I had at the time got recalled,

1166
00:57:00,591 --> 00:57:03,690
it was for what?
It was causing a rash on people because

1167
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:05,760
the battery connector wasn't.
Oh,

1168
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:06,730
right.
I don't know.

1169
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,960
They fixed it apparently now,
but I haven't bought another one since

1170
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:14,070
then because I found out that the fitbit
app on my iphone works just about the

1171
00:57:14,071 --> 00:57:18,390
same and there's also the built in apple
iphone apps now to that do the health

1172
00:57:18,391 --> 00:57:20,390
stuff,
but what w,

1173
00:57:20,391 --> 00:57:23,740
what is everyone doing with all that
data or are they doing anything with it?

1174
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,290
Mostly at all besides really,
really,

1175
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,930
really into fitness.
People like personal trainers.

1176
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,210
Well,
I think there's some technologies that

1177
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:32,650
even though they keep getting better and
better,

1178
00:57:32,651 --> 00:57:36,730
they're kind of ignored after awhile.
like here's one of the most bizarre

1179
00:57:36,731 --> 00:57:39,040
ones.
His voice sound quality.

1180
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:43,240
Nobody gives a fuck about when anybody's
voice sounds like on a phone.

1181
00:57:43,241 --> 00:57:45,100
It's like it almost never gets
discussed.

1182
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,870
Like,
isn't that one of the most important

1183
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:49,630
things about a phone?
You should be able to listen to someone

1184
00:57:49,631 --> 00:57:53,080
on a phone and it should sound like
they're talking to you and she'd be

1185
00:57:53,081 --> 00:57:53,891
like,
right here.

1186
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:54,670
Like,
what's up jamie?

1187
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:55,510
Oh hey,
what's up dude?

1188
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,990
It never sounds that good.
Yeah,

1189
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:59,380
ever.
but they have the ability to make it

1190
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:01,420
sound that good.
Well why haven't they made it sound that

1191
00:58:01,421 --> 00:58:04,150
good?
People barely fucking use their phone as

1192
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:07,450
a phone anymore.
The phone part is totally stagnant.

1193
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:09,920
Like the signal gets a little bit
better.

1194
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,640
You can catch a signal somewhere else,
but it still sounds just as shitty as it

1195
00:58:13,641 --> 00:58:16,520
ever did.
It doesn't sound perfect.

1196
00:58:16,521 --> 00:58:21,170
Clarity doesn't sound like you talking
to me in the same room you telling me

1197
00:58:21,171 --> 00:58:23,270
they can't do that.
Of course they can do that.

1198
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:28,010
If they could get you to listen better
now with a better sound now than then

1199
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,230
the rotary phones,
the 19 sixties,

1200
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:34,330
they could improve on the sound quality,
but there's no demand for it because

1201
00:58:34,331 --> 00:58:38,020
people hardly talk on the phone anymore.
So iT becomes one of those things where

1202
00:58:38,021 --> 00:58:40,090
it just hits a certain point,
nobody gives a fuck about it.

1203
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,270
And then the market goes where people
give a fuck that people give a fuck

1204
00:58:43,271 --> 00:58:45,340
about cameras.
You got to get a juicy camera.

1205
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:47,530
I want a 15,
18,

1206
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:49,840
whatever a megapixel is.
It sounds awesome.

1207
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,170
Get me one of those.
Oh,

1208
00:58:51,171 --> 00:58:53,770
it's gigapixel they have gigapixels I
need to get your pixel.

1209
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:58,540
You know,
how many people are just just buyIng the

1210
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:02,950
latest shit me included because it's the
latest shit cuz it sounds awesome,

1211
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:04,420
you know,
because you want that one.

1212
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,790
Oh,
the asce has the uh,

1213
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:11,040
image stabilization that I'll never use.
There's so much of that shit out there,

1214
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:15,220
but it seems so compelling.
you know,

1215
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:18,850
like if apple had an iphone eight,
you and me would be in line like a

1216
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:19,684
couple of years.

1217
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,070
Like I still keep talking to.
Sometimes I

1218
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:26,270
think about this for the seven s I have.
It's like it's either I have it,

1219
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,670
I like it,
that the camera's on is really good,

1220
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:30,890
but it's so big.
I kind of dislike it.

1221
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,960
How dare you?
I liked the,

1222
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,090
I liked the smaller phone,
I like to success.

1223
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:37,390
Well the six or the seven,
you know,

1224
00:59:37,391 --> 00:59:38,880
you can get a regular size one,
two,

1225
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:42,410
but the stats on the phone or are,
are down.

1226
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,780
It's not as,
it's not as good as a phone as the

1227
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,440
seven.
S is really seven s plus or we're a

1228
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:47,850
seven.
Yeah.

1229
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:52,290
Um,
as far as the hard drive in as far as

1230
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:53,124
battery life.
Right.

1231
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:56,740
It's got dual cameras.
The other ones don't have the battery

1232
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,360
on.
This is actually really good.

1233
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,510
I'm very good.
I'm super surprised at how good the

1234
01:00:01,511 --> 01:00:05,050
battery is on his phone.
Especially if you don'T keep wifi and

1235
01:00:05,051 --> 01:00:07,840
bluetooth on all the time.
You can last two days almost,

1236
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:10,750
which is way surprising because the
screen's way bigger,

1237
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:14,800
but I don't.
I could sit when the next one comes out

1238
01:00:14,801 --> 01:00:16,510
and a couple of them.
What a couple of months they're going to

1239
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:21,450
announce it probably in march or may and
there'll be out by the fall like,

1240
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:24,250
or do we need it again?
And then the answer is like why?

1241
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,260
Because we're shooting it has four k
video on it and say,

1242
01:00:26,261 --> 01:00:27,760
yeah,
I one has four k video,

1243
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:31,420
but I've barely done anything with the
four k video and the four k video I do

1244
01:00:31,421 --> 01:00:35,320
have where like or with this go pro,
I just got the new gopro five you have

1245
01:00:35,321 --> 01:00:40,210
to
convert all the footage so that you can

1246
01:00:40,211 --> 01:00:43,840
actually edit it,
which is like a big gigantic step that

1247
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,760
have tO convert it for you.

1248
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:46,603
Edit it.
Yeah,

1249
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:49,130
you can do a little bit of editing and
their program,

1250
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:54,080
but to take it into final cut or to do
what I did just to show you more than 30

1251
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:57,590
seconds at a time I had to spend
whatever,

1252
01:00:57,591 --> 01:01:00,260
12 minutes per eight minute video
converting all of it.

1253
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,780
That's only because tHat's my.
The capabilities of my computer.

1254
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:04,580
If I had a faster one,
maybe it'd been faster,

1255
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,610
but they're slower computers too and
it's just like,

1256
01:01:07,611 --> 01:01:11,120
what's the need of the four k video?
Then I couldn't even show the four k

1257
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:12,680
video out because I can't broadcast

1258
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,130
how big of these files we're talking
about.

1259
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:17,770
Huge.
For a nine minute video,

1260
01:01:17,771 --> 01:01:18,690
it was like 40 gig.

1261
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,780
Oh my god,
that's a fucking giant hard drive.

1262
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:26,870
Back in the day,
I think my first hard drive was four

1263
01:01:26,871 --> 01:01:30,530
gigs.
Forty gig for one file.

1264
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:31,550
That's crazy.

1265
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,920
For what I mean,
that's just so I could have two hours of

1266
01:01:33,921 --> 01:01:38,060
gopro footage of me walking around ces
to whittle that down and it's like,

1267
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:40,040
what is the normal person going to do
with all that?

1268
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:43,430
If they went to shoot their kids,
it's like they're going to have to have

1269
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:46,790
so many hard drives are going to become
digital orders for sure.

1270
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:48,080
YeaH.
Yeah.

1271
01:01:48,081 --> 01:01:50,360
You're talking about actual physical
space now.

1272
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:54,130
Now,
what is the benefit of that over like a

1273
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:58,100
more standard hd format other than the
fact that just looks a little bit

1274
01:01:58,101 --> 01:01:58,701
better.
I mean,

1275
01:01:58,701 --> 01:02:01,170
and really it is just a little bit like
you're.

1276
01:02:01,171 --> 01:02:05,450
You're really struggling between hd and
this four k.

1277
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:07,880
It's like I.
It's better.

1278
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,430
It's better.
It's a smidge smidge better.

1279
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,700
There was some eight k tvs at ces.
K?

1280
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:15,490
Yeah,
those motherfuckers.

1281
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,990
Several cameras that shoot ne k now.

1282
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,420
Right.
When you thought you were safe with four

1283
01:02:18,421 --> 01:02:21,450
k now,
what's going to be 80 gigs for the same

1284
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:24,660
video for at least fuck that.
That's crazy.

1285
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:25,810
Well,
and that's the.

1286
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,830
That's kind of where we're getting.
It's like there's no the distribution of

1287
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,620
this content.
Now b is b becomes the next step and the

1288
01:02:32,621 --> 01:02:36,130
next hurdle you have to get past.
I was looking around a lot at three 60

1289
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:39,790
cameras because I just got that three 60
camera and did the test footage with the

1290
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:44,530
way and that we did last week in the.
I didn't personally just like how the

1291
01:02:44,531 --> 01:02:45,311
footage looked.
There was.

1292
01:02:45,311 --> 01:02:47,950
I got a,
there was a smudge on the screen which

1293
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,920
transferred over and it doesn't look
very good and it wasn't at eye level and

1294
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:55,240
I was shoot,
I believe I was shooting that in four k.

1295
01:02:55,510 --> 01:03:00,040
It just looks a little grainy and messy
and so I was looking around that whole

1296
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:02,800
event to just try to find.
Because there were multiple,

1297
01:03:02,801 --> 01:03:05,980
three 60 cameras and multiple.
There was four k streaming,

1298
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:09,670
three 60 cameras and you need to.
They all have their own proprietary

1299
01:03:09,671 --> 01:03:13,870
software to run it off of a,
but I did find one really good one which

1300
01:03:13,871 --> 01:03:18,130
does three d,
360 video,

1301
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:21,130
which was really,
really cool.

1302
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:23,980
But I'm also wondering too if I saw
something,

1303
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:28,450
one really good edited video they made
to show it off or if I was actually

1304
01:03:28,451 --> 01:03:31,450
seeing this is basically exactly what
the camera does.

1305
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:35,560
Straight like pretty much straight off
of it because it was really cool.

1306
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:39,040
It's called the views camera and eye
contact

1307
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:40,920
you're getting.
That's when you're getting into really

1308
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:44,370
bizarre stuff right when you're talking
about like eight k video and they need

1309
01:03:44,371 --> 01:03:49,371
to talk to you about 360 degree three d
because it seems like if we're going to

1310
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:54,000
enter intO a real virtual realm anytime
in the near future,

1311
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:58,980
all this ramping up of the specs or you
know going from four k to eight k and

1312
01:03:58,981 --> 01:04:00,810
then you know 32 k's just around the
corner.

1313
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,880
They're just going to keep getting
better at this shit.

1314
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,990
And when you're talking about something
through like a high end glass,

1315
01:04:06,991 --> 01:04:11,190
like a really high end,
like a binocular type class and then

1316
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,280
having insanely high definition video
and then having this exponential jump in

1317
01:04:18,781 --> 01:04:23,400
this virtual technology where they
figured out a way to really lock you

1318
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:27,770
into something that is not,
it's not invasive to the point where

1319
01:04:27,771 --> 01:04:30,620
it's not liKe fucking with your
experience by you feeling it on your

1320
01:04:30,621 --> 01:04:32,150
head.
It's very light,

1321
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:34,220
you know,
because sometimes you putting those

1322
01:04:34,221 --> 01:04:36,400
bulky headsets and the goggles,
you know,

1323
01:04:36,401 --> 01:04:39,200
it's over your eyes like that's going to
shrink up to,

1324
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:40,820
that's going to shrink up to almost
nothing.

1325
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:46,430
And with um,
with all these big jumps that they're

1326
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:49,760
making,
how far away are we from some fully

1327
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,230
immersive avatar world

1328
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:55,583
gotta be getting close.

1329
01:04:56,230 --> 01:05:00,880
It's going to be bananas.
Do you know what's going to be like an

1330
01:05:00,881 --> 01:05:04,060
avatar world that you could go go for a
journey in?

1331
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:09,250
I mean imagine if movies,
if what they become.

1332
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:13,150
Because you know,
think about how these serial shows like

1333
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:16,090
sopranos and then ultimately,
you know,

1334
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:18,850
game oF and a lot of these other great
shows,

1335
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,810
they,
they catch you and they rope you in and

1336
01:05:22,811 --> 01:05:27,811
they bring you into a world and then you
follow that world episode after episode

1337
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,490
and you get sucked into it,
right?

1338
01:05:30,491 --> 01:05:32,890
It's very different than a regular
movie.

1339
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,280
What did they start doing?
These cereal?

1340
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,070
I mean,
I think of like game of thrones is a

1341
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,780
serial movie,
right?

1342
01:05:40,781 --> 01:05:45,340
There's a hundred parts to this movie,
but it's a big giant ass movie.

1343
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:45,910
I mean,
it's,

1344
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:47,680
it's,
it's so much better than a regular

1345
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:52,060
television show in terms of like it's
special effects and the grandness of it

1346
01:05:52,061 --> 01:05:52,894
all.

1347
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,740
If they can figure out how to film
something like that,

1348
01:05:56,741 --> 01:06:00,970
but let you participate in it.
I mean,

1349
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:05,650
uh,
let you strap on to some three d

1350
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:10,830
treadmill type thing and move around in
this fucking weird world and follow

1351
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:17,560
these people on their journeys.
Be right there when the orc slaughter

1352
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:21,510
the people,
like the blood splatter in front of you

1353
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:24,880
and you're watching theM get chopped up
and then you're going to go over the

1354
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:27,730
mountain to where the castle is.
You have to actually walk over the

1355
01:06:27,731 --> 01:06:30,220
mountain,
but as you walk over the mountain,

1356
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,830
horses ride beside you.
You get to see them.

1357
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:35,063
I mean,

1358
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:40,170
we're real close to something like that.
I feel like that's only a few years

1359
01:06:40,171 --> 01:06:41,004
away.

1360
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:45,120
Avatar world coming out soon.
Like in disney at disney disney world.

1361
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:47,000
What are they going to do?
How's that going to work?

1362
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,420
They've been showing some things like
this is,

1363
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:52,990
I think this is just a imagineering,
whoa idea,

1364
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:55,940
but just like you're gonna be able to
take a boat ride through the middle of

1365
01:06:55,941 --> 01:06:57,260
the navi forest.

1366
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:57,991
Oh,
okay.

1367
01:06:57,991 --> 01:06:59,870
Well that looks like it's a small world.
Yeah,

1368
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:03,040
it's going to be a little bit of a step,
but they're going to have some vr stuff.

1369
01:07:03,041 --> 01:07:05,880
You're gonna be able to float through
and go on the uh,

1370
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:08,250
whoa.
Here's how they look and disney world

1371
01:07:08,251 --> 01:07:09,840
right now.
Oh wow.

1372
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:11,760
So they're,
they're building it right now.

1373
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:13,440
You're obviously not going to have to
walk on that.

1374
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:17,850
When is this going to take place?
I think it opens this later this year.

1375
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,550
Disneyland does not next year,
but what you're saying,

1376
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,890
what else?
They just took the extension of that and

1377
01:07:22,891 --> 01:07:25,560
just instead of like making the avatar
movie,

1378
01:07:25,561 --> 01:07:26,311
they just went,
look,

1379
01:07:26,311 --> 01:07:30,220
avatar is avatar world and if you want
to come live it out,

1380
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:32,530
you've got to come to disney world and
pay 50 bucks.

1381
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,430
100 bucks or $150 bucks,
300 bucks.

1382
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:36,910
Something crazy to do it.

1383
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:39,590
Now you're talking.
That would be,

1384
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,820
this is what you do.
You construct that world and then once

1385
01:07:43,821 --> 01:07:46,400
you're in that world,
then you put on the vr goggles and it

1386
01:07:46,401 --> 01:07:51,401
turns everything into fluorescent neon
greens and blues and like the avatar

1387
01:07:52,431 --> 01:07:55,070
world.
You could see everything and then you

1388
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,170
actually watched the movie play out in
there.

1389
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:02,120
That would be a nerd gas.
I feel like they're way closer to

1390
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:06,100
something like that.
Then we are everyone being able to do

1391
01:08:06,101 --> 01:08:06,990
with this app.

1392
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,010
Well,
the thing about that though is it's

1393
01:08:09,011 --> 01:08:13,790
going to require so much resources and
land and money and it's Just,

1394
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,940
I feel like a three d treadmill and uh,
you know,

1395
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:20,580
where you can't,
you don't phySically go anywhere,

1396
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,980
you're not going to be able to go up
hills and you're not gonna,

1397
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:25,740
you're not gonna feel a sensation of
walking,

1398
01:08:25,741 --> 01:08:28,110
climbing things.
That's the only difference,

1399
01:08:28,590 --> 01:08:30,330
but you'll be able to be like right in
front of it,

1400
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,910
but it won't feel like grass.
You know what I mean?

1401
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:38,270
Like if they could figure out a way to
do a virtual world where somehow or

1402
01:08:39,631 --> 01:08:44,070
another you could change the textiles on
the ground or changed the way it feels,

1403
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:47,160
the tactile sensation of what you're
stepping on.

1404
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,360
If you can make it feel like water.
If you can make it feel like grass or

1405
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:54,840
dirt.
If they could start doing shit like

1406
01:08:54,841 --> 01:08:56,610
that,
that doesn't seem outside.

1407
01:08:56,611 --> 01:09:01,611
The realm of possibility Just seems like
something way too smart for a dummy like

1408
01:09:01,741 --> 01:09:02,530
me to figure out.

1409
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:06,130
So there's one technology at cds,
there's a couple things there I didn't

1410
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:07,810
get a chance to even see.

1411
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:13,080
WHat does it say wants to let you feel
fabric through your touch screen?

1412
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:14,570
Whoa.
Yeah.

1413
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:15,960
I hand invis

1414
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,840
I find it there.
There are a lot of places I think I was

1415
01:09:18,841 --> 01:09:19,840
trying to find that I couldn't hear

1416
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:21,660
and actually just find,
you know,

1417
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:25,600
dudes are going to use that for just
gonna rub girls' panties and porn films

1418
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:28,180
and it's going to be the only
application for it.

1419
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,120
Oh,
it's right there.

1420
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:32,530
Touch it.
The idea of it sounds pretty interesting

1421
01:09:32,531 --> 01:09:33,370
though.
Yeah,

1422
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:34,740
I mean you can,
you can have a like a,

1423
01:09:34,741 --> 01:09:38,500
a bump to it.
So is it working on an ipad or something

1424
01:09:38,501 --> 01:09:39,334
with a.

1425
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,310
It uses a little bit of like the haptic
feedback that is already built into some

1426
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:45,080
of these things,
but it uses it differently.

1427
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,590
So that was what it was kind of cool
about.

1428
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:51,040
Um,
the htc vibe is that haptic feedback

1429
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,470
because when you're doing the bow and
arrow thing,

1430
01:09:53,471 --> 01:09:55,870
it really does kind of feel like you're
drawing the arrow back,

1431
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,800
gives you a little bit of vibration as
if the arrow is pulling across the arrow

1432
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,590
restaurants rubbing on it.
It's really cool.

1433
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,720
So they just made some announcements to,
they didn't,

1434
01:10:05,721 --> 01:10:07,370
they're not going to make a new vibe
yet,

1435
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,610
but uh,
they showed a new head set attachment

1436
01:10:10,611 --> 01:10:14,340
that makes the vibe put on your head a
little bit more comfortably and this

1437
01:10:14,341 --> 01:10:17,270
showed what they're calling the tracker,
which is essentially the end of the

1438
01:10:17,271 --> 01:10:20,180
controller which can be attached to.
They said anything.

1439
01:10:20,181 --> 01:10:22,490
So it depends what a developer makes it
work with,

1440
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:26,840
but one of the things they showed as it
were on the end of a gun told us to like

1441
01:10:26,841 --> 01:10:31,520
play different gun games.
They put on the end of a baseball bat

1442
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,353
and a baseball bat.
Then you could,

1443
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,390
you could see the bat and the vive game
that you were playing or the baseball

1444
01:10:35,391 --> 01:10:38,440
simulation you were playing,
but they could pull in real major league

1445
01:10:38,441 --> 01:10:41,390
baseball pitches,
actual data because they have them all

1446
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,650
from the last,
I don't know,

1447
01:10:42,651 --> 01:10:45,920
five to 10 years.
Any pitch from any picture you want to

1448
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:47,750
see.
You can have now come at you and you can

1449
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:49,840
go ahead and try to hit it.
Oh my god.

1450
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,060
Probably then put you theoretically at
any park you want or wherever the hell

1451
01:10:53,061 --> 01:10:54,530
you want to be swinging baseball bats.

1452
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,070
How many dudes are going to be blown
their shoulders apart?

1453
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:59,500
Well,
swinging in the air with this thing,

1454
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:02,350
hopefully you're not bashing your house
up to,

1455
01:11:02,351 --> 01:11:06,610
but like that idea can be expounded on.
Now would you,

1456
01:11:06,611 --> 01:11:08,380
uh,
I would think that if you were going to

1457
01:11:08,381 --> 01:11:11,290
do something like that,
you would want to do it with a bat

1458
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:13,800
that's like the same weight as a real
bat.

1459
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,880
You'd probably want the x.
They had an actual wooden baseball bat.

1460
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:19,260
They just screwed the thing on the
bottom.

1461
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:20,460
Oh,
that's great.

1462
01:11:20,461 --> 01:11:22,470
Yeah.
So you could do it with that.

1463
01:11:22,471 --> 01:11:24,180
You could probably have a sword.
You could probably have a.

1464
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,110
Oh shit.
Yeah.

1465
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:28,390
If you had a sword,
do you know,

1466
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,490
kind of a fucking awesome workout you
would get.

1467
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:34,900
My arms were so tired at dunkin's place
just for playing his archery thing and

1468
01:11:34,901 --> 01:11:38,410
I'm not even pulling anything back.
I'm just holding my arm up.

1469
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:40,990
Like there's no,
there's no actual resistance pulling the

1470
01:11:40,991 --> 01:11:43,810
bow back,
but just holding your arms straight in

1471
01:11:43,811 --> 01:11:46,450
front of you and doing this over and
over again.

1472
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,010
my arms were killing me,
man.

1473
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,330
I was like,
this is amazing.

1474
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:52,480
Like this actually has some physical
benefit to it.

1475
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:56,590
And the boxing game,
the boxing game has real benefit to it.

1476
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:58,750
Like the boxing game,
I think you could,

1477
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:03,070
you could learn how a person moves and
how it feels like to spar with them.

1478
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,220
You see punches come at,
you can learn how to slip punches,

1479
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,080
you can learn how to counter with
things.

1480
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:11,700
You don't feel hitting anything.
That's the only thing that's missing and

1481
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:14,080
you don't feel them hitting you.
But at least when they hit you,

1482
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:14,980
you see like spark.

1483
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:15,910
So,
uh,

1484
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:18,550
one of the try to find that a little bit
really.

1485
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,200
It's not worth me pumped the video.
But uh,

1486
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:25,260
there was a haptic feedback,
a essentially a backpack slash chest

1487
01:12:25,811 --> 01:12:30,811
thing you put on for vr that would give
you some sort of shocks or you'd feel

1488
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:33,550
something.
I don't know how hard it would feel

1489
01:12:33,551 --> 01:12:35,710
should jolt the shit out of you.
There was another,

1490
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,050
there's a company that in the video I
watched showing the data trackers that

1491
01:12:41,051 --> 01:12:42,330
they were adding onto different,
uh,

1492
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,610
devices.
They put it on a fire hose and they also

1493
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,800
put a jacket on you that had heaters in
it.

1494
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,130
So your boy putting out a fire and
that's given you feedback of the hose.

1495
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,350
It's also getting warmer and you're
getting hot.

1496
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,320
So like there's different.
I don't,

1497
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:59,050
that's not really a game as more of it
as a simulation or it is a training

1498
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,780
training tool for an actual fire
company.

1499
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,530
Well,
it's also to let you know like what's

1500
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,620
the potential for like a doom game from
2000

1501
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,060
for 24.
Yeah.

1502
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,030
Maybe not even.
Maybe two years from now.

1503
01:13:10,031 --> 01:13:12,940
Hopefully we'll see what happens at e
three this year with what these

1504
01:13:12,941 --> 01:13:16,900
companies are going to announce with the
new xbox is supposedly supposedly going

1505
01:13:16,901 --> 01:13:17,740
to have a vr.

1506
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:22,950
If someone comes up with a haptic
feedback suit that's able to get hot and

1507
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:27,720
cold and vibrate and jolt and even give
you a little bit of pain.

1508
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:29,700
Yeah,
you need something,

1509
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:33,510
you need a little bit of pain,
a little fucker,

1510
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,490
you know,
where you're really feeling it.

1511
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,040
Remember that was that,
uh,

1512
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:40,310
I don't know which James Bond movie it
was where they were holding on to the.

1513
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:44,010
There's some sort of like stick they're
holding onto and like the loser,

1514
01:13:44,011 --> 01:13:45,900
it just gets more painful and like
trying.

1515
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:49,050
It's like a man man versus man contest,
but there's a bunch of,

1516
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:50,250
like at a cocktail party.

1517
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:52,190
I don't remember that one.
I'm,

1518
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,460
I avoided a lot of those James Bond
movies.

1519
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:58,690
Eddie bravo said something to me a long
time ago and it fucked me up.

1520
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,980
We were talking about,
um,

1521
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:04,330
it wasn't a conspiracy thing.
We were talking about,

1522
01:14:04,331 --> 01:14:06,610
uh,
like action movies and he's like,

1523
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:10,270
the problem with this action movies is
you always know who's going to live.

1524
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,790
The guys always going to live like he
never.

1525
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:15,190
Oh yeah.
He's going to hang by fucking thread.

1526
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,510
Yep.
He's gonna make it.

1527
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,670
He's gonna live,
you know he's going to live.

1528
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:20,610
I'm like,
you motherfucker.

1529
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:24,460
Like I knew that.
Of course I knew that you go to see the

1530
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:27,700
terminator or you go to see a predator.
You don't think that arnold

1531
01:14:27,701 --> 01:14:29,980
schwarzenegger is going to get killed by
the alien at the end.

1532
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:33,340
No.
You think that's actually really bad for

1533
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:34,174
us,
isn't it?

1534
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:39,820
It's really bad to have the the good guy
when and all of them.

1535
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:43,450
That's why I think like no country for
old men is probably important.

1536
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:47,860
So important to know that sometimes the
guy who you think's gonna live gets shot

1537
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:51,370
in the last couple of minutes of the
movie and the other guy just wanders off

1538
01:14:51,371 --> 01:14:53,590
spoiler,
and that's the end of the movie and

1539
01:14:53,591 --> 01:14:55,660
you're like,
what the fuck kind of movie is this?

1540
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:58,180
Well,
that's a movie that's more like a real

1541
01:14:58,181 --> 01:15:02,050
live story.
Arnold can't beat that alien.

1542
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,180
You know it.
I know it.

1543
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,510
That thing's gonna.
Fuck him up.

1544
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:09,160
Why are we pretending this is stupid?
It's not a world where I can imagine

1545
01:15:09,161 --> 01:15:13,570
that predator losing to arnold
schwartzenegger I can't see,

1546
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:15,820
aren't ongoing at the donald.
The other day,

1547
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,220
no I didn't,
but I can't believe that donald wanted

1548
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,490
arnold.
He's the god damn president sir.

1549
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:24,670
Down of course.
Well he see he compared it to his first

1550
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:25,990
season,
you know,

1551
01:15:25,991 --> 01:15:28,180
and then all the 15 seasons he did
afterwards,

1552
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:31,420
they fired him from that show for
talking about mexicans.

1553
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:34,750
Did you know that?
That's when they fired him.

1554
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,710
They fired him from that show and he's
still the executive producer.

1555
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,710
So he's talking shit about a show that
he's still the executive producer of.

1556
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,970
How is he allowed to be a producer?
He gets his fucking friends.

1557
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,230
I don't know all the rules about that,
but I thought there were rules about

1558
01:15:50,231 --> 01:15:53,320
that.
He's probably going to step down now

1559
01:15:53,321 --> 01:15:54,570
that he's president.
I don't know.

1560
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:56,830
He said he was going to do a step down
from a bunch of shit.

1561
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:57,760
Now that he's president,

1562
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,720
it'll dude,
it's going to be weird.

1563
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:04,710
Fucking for sure.
It's going to be weird and he's going to

1564
01:16:04,711 --> 01:16:08,380
be weird during the weirdest era ever.
It's next friday,

1565
01:16:08,381 --> 01:16:09,214
right?
Yup.

1566
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,670
Twentieth.
Soon as he gets into place.

1567
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:15,800
You think's going to happen that day.
So paint the white house black house,

1568
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:17,230
you know,
open up right in front.

1569
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:22,120
It's going to be like a river of lava.
Does that the actual end of the world

1570
01:16:22,121 --> 01:16:24,880
day?
Yeah.

1571
01:16:24,881 --> 01:16:27,070
The mayans were only off by four or five
years.

1572
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:30,100
They were off by a little.
What did they think?

1573
01:16:30,101 --> 01:16:31,520
December 20.
First 2012.

1574
01:16:31,521 --> 01:16:34,220
So they were off.
They were off a little four years.

1575
01:16:34,221 --> 01:16:34,971
In a month.
Yeah.

1576
01:16:34,971 --> 01:16:37,490
Not that bad.
Not that bad.

1577
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,850
They might sit a little bit.
They did it thousands years ago,

1578
01:16:40,851 --> 01:16:43,580
man.
Few fucking guessing thousands of years

1579
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:46,640
ago.
Me and I wonder if there really is like

1580
01:16:46,641 --> 01:16:51,140
a cycle where a civilizations just,
they,

1581
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:56,210
they get to a point where all the monkey
shit that led them to scratch and scrape

1582
01:16:57,531 --> 01:17:02,531
and dominate and procreate and get to a
point where they have a city and finally

1583
01:17:03,921 --> 01:17:05,120
get a little bit of safety.

1584
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:08,990
All of that just bites it in the ass
because all those,

1585
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:11,930
even though you've gotten past the
monkey existence,

1586
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:16,130
all those monkey dna,
human reward systems,

1587
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:20,090
they're all still in place and they
still make you want to chase the same

1588
01:17:20,091 --> 01:17:22,880
shit that people chased thousands of
years ago.

1589
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:27,910
Conquest and domination and control the
food supply and now that I'm president,

1590
01:17:29,931 --> 01:17:34,931
I'll have all the gold
that need for competition.

1591
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:40,250
That's going to be one of the things
that I think technology is probably

1592
01:17:40,251 --> 01:17:45,251
going to neutralize first.
I think that when You get,

1593
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:52,110
when you get a hive mind type scenario,
which is a hive mind or a virtual

1594
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:57,970
virtual worlds scenario where it's
literally preferable to this world,

1595
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:03,100
like why would you want to hang around
and just go to west hills and get lunch

1596
01:18:03,101 --> 01:18:06,280
at some shitty place and wait in this
thing and then go to the movie.

1597
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:09,580
Why would you even want to do that?
When you get all your food through an

1598
01:18:09,581 --> 01:18:13,570
ivy and you're going to live in the
avatar world for a couple of weeks,

1599
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:17,010
lot of people would do it.
Dude.

1600
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:20,440
Damn food would probably be the only
problem,

1601
01:18:20,441 --> 01:18:24,000
like food and taking a shit.
There's not a black mirror episode.

1602
01:18:24,001 --> 01:18:26,140
You just started saying it had another
time.

1603
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:28,740
It's happened from time to time.
Like you just start going down a concept

1604
01:18:28,741 --> 01:18:31,180
and it's like that's a black mirror
episode.

1605
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:32,740
Original fuck.
Yeah.

1606
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:35,970
what can I say?
It was just an idea that you can go live

1607
01:18:35,971 --> 01:18:38,100
in another,
in another place that's going to happen

1608
01:18:38,101 --> 01:18:40,110
that amount of time.
What's the name of that episode?

1609
01:18:40,111 --> 01:18:44,250
I want to watch it.
San junipero I think is that one gonna

1610
01:18:44,251 --> 01:18:47,820
happen man.
It's just a matter of time and when it

1611
01:18:47,821 --> 01:18:50,370
does happen,
it might be a complete mental

1612
01:18:50,371 --> 01:18:52,560
experience.
Like you might get out of this and you

1613
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,680
might be like those poor guys who come
back after a space walks,

1614
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:58,110
you know those guys at are up there.

1615
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:03,110
LIke I'm a hatfield commander hatfield.
I had him on the podcast and he was

1616
01:19:04,051 --> 01:19:08,070
describing after being.
I think he was up for six months.

1617
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:11,310
I think so yeah.
It was a long fucking time and when he

1618
01:19:11,311 --> 01:19:16,110
came back down like his body's brittle
takes like a year for your bone density

1619
01:19:16,111 --> 01:19:17,430
to come back.
Like you're,

1620
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,740
you're a mess.
You can't stand.

1621
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:22,770
He's throwing up all over the place,
your whole body.

1622
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:25,860
So baffled because you've been up in
space for six months.

1623
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:30,880
Like those guys make a tremendous
sacrifice so that we can understand like

1624
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,690
what happens to people's bodies and zero
gravity,

1625
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,180
like all these people that are signing
up to go to mars and want to go on all

1626
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,910
these journeys and space like settle the
fuck down.

1627
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,980
Okay.
We might be able to go to better spots

1628
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:47,310
and we just stay right here.
We need to put a,

1629
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:49,680
a,
a roof on this thing.

1630
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:53,640
We got rocks flying in.
Need to put a god damn roof on the

1631
01:19:53,641 --> 01:19:58,641
planet.
Build that first big ass thick roof with

1632
01:19:59,611 --> 01:20:02,490
lcd screens.
So at the bottom of it,

1633
01:20:02,491 --> 01:20:05,580
It just shows nothing but beautiful
skies.

1634
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:07,890
Everywhere you go,
it's going to be like

1635
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:13,040
the truman show
and there's gonna be a big scoop that

1636
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:15,270
catches all the rain.
The rain is going to fall on the

1637
01:20:15,271 --> 01:20:18,510
outside,
it's going to get funneled through,

1638
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:23,550
but we need like a four foot wall now.
It wouldn't even matter.

1639
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:26,430
The the,
the kind of asteroids that killed the

1640
01:20:26,431 --> 01:20:28,980
dinosaurs.
I think they said something crazy like

1641
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:31,650
it was five miles deep into the earth
within the first half.

1642
01:20:31,651 --> 01:20:34,200
A second.
Yeah.

1643
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:38,250
I might've made those numbers up,
but it's in that range where it's so

1644
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:40,800
preposterous.
I rememBer hearing this guy speak about

1645
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:45,801
it and talking about just the.
The impact that the earth rang for a

1646
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:48,343
million years.

1647
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:49,673
Bob

1648
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:56,930
rang from the impact for a million years
out.

1649
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:02,150
What the fuck is that like so we can't
really have a.

1650
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,900
We need something better than a roof.
That's what I'm trying to say.

1651
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:07,190
Work on that first and you got damn
virtual reality.

1652
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:12,030
Then think about going to mars.
I was listening to richard dawkins talk

1653
01:21:12,031 --> 01:21:14,390
to sam harris today on this podcast.
Very interesting,

1654
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,810
but one of the things that we're talking
about is people going to mars and if

1655
01:21:17,811 --> 01:21:21,470
they did colonize mars,
the genes on mars would not be in

1656
01:21:21,471 --> 01:21:25,700
contact with the jeans back here on
earth and would human beings go off in

1657
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,760
different directions and then on top of
that genetic manipulation once genetic

1658
01:21:31,161 --> 01:21:35,060
manipulation gets perfected and they
start really fucking with people's dna

1659
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:38,960
and really changing what people look
like and what,

1660
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:42,440
how they can perform and how their
Brains work was going to be like in

1661
01:21:42,441 --> 01:21:45,830
comparison,
like the guys that are doing tHat on

1662
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,720
earth versus the people that are doing
it on mars.

1663
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:51,420
Yeah,
that's weird.

1664
01:21:51,421 --> 01:21:53,680
I ended.
The atmosphere is obviously different in

1665
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:58,300
general because of the way it's really
grow and just be different.

1666
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:02,650
He can't breathe it.
You have to somehow or another they're

1667
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:04,150
going to have to terraform,

1668
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:09,210
create an atmosphere or um,
they're gonna have to put some kind of a

1669
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:14,140
like domes up and live inside the domes,
which is terrifying.

1670
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:18,290
What is that kai?
I feel like,

1671
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,600
was it an interstellar where they made.
We didn't like,

1672
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:23,520
we call it,
we didn't colonize planets,

1673
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:28,521
but we've made life floating terraform
cylinders and we lived on those.

1674
01:22:28,730 --> 01:22:29,580
Is that what that was?

1675
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:33,350
I didn't watch that whole movie.
I got to most mostly did that movie and

1676
01:22:33,351 --> 01:22:34,520
I fell asleep on a plane.

1677
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:39,640
So you didn't see the end and seeing
that movie at the chinese theater was

1678
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:44,390
where I saw it done in hollywood when he
goes and they go into the black hole and

1679
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:47,240
I remember even reading,
that's where Christopher Nolan was t

1680
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,820
test watching that movie.
It was so loud.

1681
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:53,270
So big.
It made that such an awesome experience.

1682
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:56,960
Chinese theaters I'd love.
I love to see it makes bad movies.

1683
01:22:56,961 --> 01:22:57,270
Good.

1684
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:58,590
Yeah.
I saw pulp fiction.

1685
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,410
There was like,
holy shit.

1686
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:05,770
That was when pulp fiction first came
out and this was like 90 or something.

1687
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:07,683
Yeah,
man,

1688
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,900
I didn't see that movie,
but that matt damon movie the martian

1689
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:14,500
was all about terraforming and trying to
survive on mars.

1690
01:23:14,501 --> 01:23:16,420
Did you watch the arrival yet?
I must have watched that.

1691
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,380
No,
no,

1692
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:19,090
I haven't seen.
It hurts really good though.

1693
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:21,910
it looks really good,
but that kind of came and went,

1694
01:23:21,911 --> 01:23:24,880
huh?
I mean kind of events that just how it

1695
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:26,800
goes now.
There's too fast.

1696
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,590
Things are too good.
Too much that people want to watch them

1697
01:23:29,591 --> 01:23:30,850
at home now.
Yeah.

1698
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,370
That too.
They're going to start allowing that to

1699
01:23:33,371 --> 01:23:36,130
happen I think are charged with more.
Yeah.

1700
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:37,690
Charging 50 bucks.
Yeah.

1701
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,670
Nobody's figured out how to get through
the uh,

1702
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:44,110
well maybe they have get through the
apple tv and downloaded.

1703
01:23:44,111 --> 01:23:46,810
Have they like to steal from that?
I don't think so.

1704
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:49,780
You don't like to steal from that?
So just ask.

1705
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:51,670
I'm assuming you mean steal from them?
Yeah.

1706
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,840
Yeah.
I don't think so.

1707
01:23:52,841 --> 01:23:54,550
I don't know.
I don't think anybody's been able to do

1708
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:55,384
that.
Maybe they have,

1709
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:58,750
but like when you're streaming,
like you're streaming,

1710
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:00,520
I guess if you were streaming to a
computer,

1711
01:24:00,521 --> 01:24:03,610
that might be a way to do it.
A screen capture and some sort of way.

1712
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:05,960
Maybe.
Maybe not.

1713
01:24:05,961 --> 01:24:07,970
I don't know because they have it built
into the.

1714
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:10,730
Well,
I guess it's streaming a lot of the htmi

1715
01:24:10,731 --> 01:24:12,440
cable is now,
uh,

1716
01:24:12,441 --> 01:24:14,630
if you're,
when you have your xbox or your,

1717
01:24:14,631 --> 01:24:17,690
another system hooked up to something
that you're trying to do game capturing

1718
01:24:17,691 --> 01:24:19,580
onto like Broadcast on twitch or
something.

1719
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:24,950
If you bring up a video or like your tv
turns on it goes black because it knows

1720
01:24:24,951 --> 01:24:29,090
that that signal is bad.
It's not supposed to be broadcast.

1721
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:33,130
It's not tHe game signal at the tv
signal and you'll probably people's

1722
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:36,290
trying to show tv online,
it knows that you're trying to or

1723
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,300
whatever.
They put the dispute that stop in there.

1724
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:40,000
Right.
Exactly.

1725
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:40,900
Be removed.
Right.

1726
01:24:40,901 --> 01:24:44,610
Or maybe maybe.
But I feel like there's gotta be a way

1727
01:24:44,611 --> 01:24:48,360
to take apple.
Like when you're using your computer,

1728
01:24:48,361 --> 01:24:51,120
you can use a regular computer and watch
things on itunes,

1729
01:24:51,121 --> 01:24:51,954
correct?

1730
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:53,940
Yes.

1731
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,790
Right.
So if you were using a regular computer

1732
01:24:56,791 --> 01:25:01,110
and you were streaming a movie,
like there's gotta be a way that you

1733
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:03,720
would be able to screen capture that
with your computer.

1734
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:04,800
Oh yeah,
for sure.

1735
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:06,900
But just open up a program.
You mean record?

1736
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,060
Just record it.
Yeah.

1737
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:09,870
Yeah.
And then would have just some big ass

1738
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:12,450
file that would be like the hobbit or
whatever the hell you were screened

1739
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:14,370
there.
There's probably a way they can put in

1740
01:25:14,371 --> 01:25:19,050
some sort of digital rights management
thing that it will put brian record to

1741
01:25:19,051 --> 01:25:23,790
that or it'll put of big watermark on if
you try to do that or maybe not.

1742
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:26,730
And then someone will hack away to
against it and that that's like a battle

1743
01:25:26,731 --> 01:25:29,580
probably going onto the battle that will
go on forever,

1744
01:25:29,581 --> 01:25:30,414
right?
Yeah.

1745
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:32,850
I'll just make a new file format and
then

1746
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,900
videos will be in that file format for
the next five years until it gets

1747
01:25:36,901 --> 01:25:37,734
hacked.

1748
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:42,880
Keep playing cat and mouse games.
I think it's really interesting when we

1749
01:25:42,881 --> 01:25:47,690
were looking at that video or the
article rather about the people that

1750
01:25:47,691 --> 01:25:52,691
we're transmitting ola and chow back and
forth through the internet.

1751
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,930
And then think about this kind of stuff
that you're talking about,

1752
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,650
like really high level digital
management.

1753
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:04,670
He putting out four k are you streaming

1754
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:07,940
movies and people are trying to steal it
and you know,

1755
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:11,810
think about all the bit torrents and all
the different files that are available

1756
01:26:11,811 --> 01:26:14,570
online when it comes to all these movies
and hollywood studios.

1757
01:26:14,571 --> 01:26:17,260
Pen spend millions of dollars to make
and then boom,

1758
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:22,261
a screeners online like moments before
it's released and like this constant

1759
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:25,600
battle of technologies.
It's just,

1760
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,590
it's really crazy because we could just
sit here and like just show up at this

1761
01:26:29,591 --> 01:26:31,210
ces.
We don't have to participate at all.

1762
01:26:31,390 --> 01:26:33,040
Show up every year.
What you got now?

1763
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,170
One year.
What do you got now?

1764
01:26:35,171 --> 01:26:36,820
Can you,
can you read my mind yet?

1765
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:37,870
Nope,
not yet.

1766
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:39,820
I'll see you in a year.
What about now?

1767
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,660
Will we can't read your mind but we can
send you images.

1768
01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:45,010
Okay.
We'll see you in a year.

1769
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,760
Can you read my mind yet?
he just keep going back.

1770
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,560
Like you don't have to do any work.

1771
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:54,190
Like no one gets mad at us.
It's not like the people in the village

1772
01:26:54,191 --> 01:26:57,100
that had to go get the water.
Like you drink water every day.

1773
01:26:57,101 --> 01:26:59,230
You fuck,
you never go and get water and they

1774
01:26:59,231 --> 01:27:02,230
never asked you to get water.
You just got to give them money and

1775
01:27:02,231 --> 01:27:04,150
they'll just keep doing it.
You just show up every week and they

1776
01:27:04,151 --> 01:27:05,440
never go,
what do I have here?

1777
01:27:05,441 --> 01:27:07,550
What do you have for me?
What do you have for me?

1778
01:27:07,551 --> 01:27:09,320
If you want to see my mind reading
machine,

1779
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:11,660
I got money.
Not good enough.

1780
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:14,330
NoBody ever says that it now like you
don't have to.

1781
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:19,430
You literally don't have to participate
in it to enjoy the benefits of it.

1782
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,750
It's a rare thing.

1783
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,530
Yeah.
I was trying to think of a,

1784
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:31,280
like at the end of the car companies
outside was showing some stuff,

1785
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:36,470
but it was super.
It was like a call to the statue,

1786
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,510
but it was supposed to be an actual
model of a car.

1787
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:44,900
They called the car statue because it
doesn't have a drive train in it.

1788
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:49,730
There were people sitting in it.
It was supposed to look like whatever a

1789
01:27:49,731 --> 01:27:51,560
future thing was.
But the girl that kept,

1790
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:54,110
uh,
she was telling you what was going on

1791
01:27:54,111 --> 01:27:56,400
and explaining things to you.
She kept calling.

1792
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:58,880
She kept referring to the car as a
statue.

1793
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:01,820
I thought that was weird because I think
I've tried to show it to you before.

1794
01:28:01,821 --> 01:28:02,480
We were lIke,
does that.

1795
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,150
Is that real?

1796
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:05,370
Is that legal ease?
Yeah,

1797
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:08,970
that doesn't work then that when you
call something a statue,

1798
01:28:08,971 --> 01:28:12,510
you could say that it's a prototype,
like this is what we hope it looks like

1799
01:28:12,511 --> 01:28:15,240
in the future,
but based on what like do you know what

1800
01:28:15,241 --> 01:28:16,310
the imaGes.
Do you have a.

1801
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:18,430
Can you pull it up?
I was trying to remember who it was.

1802
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:22,800
I want to say is it seems like if you
just call it a statue,

1803
01:28:22,801 --> 01:28:27,390
you could just totally bullshit people.
It doesn't have to have any basis in

1804
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:32,010
real engineering or anything.
You can just say it's a statue and he

1805
01:28:32,011 --> 01:28:33,930
could just have like a design concepts
to it.

1806
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:38,250
Was it a concept as far as like a crazy
technological

1807
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:40,850
vehicle with that?
I think that's what they were trying to

1808
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:42,260
show off the tech

1809
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:43,860
inside.
Yeah.

1810
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:48,510
Have you seen like what new cars are
doing now where all their dashboards are

1811
01:28:48,511 --> 01:28:49,600
all lcds.
That's

1812
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,550
what I was trying to get.
That's what they were trying to show.

1813
01:28:51,551 --> 01:28:54,540
I think a little bit was like this is
what the new dashboard and everything's

1814
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:56,410
going to look like.
Go ahead and sit in there.

1815
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,420
It's crazy.
Whenever one of the bmw,

1816
01:28:58,421 --> 01:29:00,790
I think it was an eight,
they had it inside the event.

1817
01:29:00,791 --> 01:29:03,570
There was long line for this,
so 100 percent wasn't waiting,

1818
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:06,360
but you put on the,
I think it was the microsoft surface

1819
01:29:06,361 --> 01:29:08,490
with it,
so I don't know why you would have this

1820
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:12,030
on while you're driving,
but maybe in the future we'll be doing

1821
01:29:12,031 --> 01:29:15,840
that and you're getting all sorts of
extra information.

1822
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:17,720
Um,
at least my,

1823
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:19,610
this is still just a prototype,
so I don't know.

1824
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:22,440
You weren't driving down the street so I
don't know what they're showing you.

1825
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:25,050
They're just blasting stuff in your face
on what it might look like.

1826
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:28,600
Wow.
I don't know what you would be wanting

1827
01:29:28,601 --> 01:29:29,800
to see though also.

1828
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:32,530
Well,
it just seems like whatever,

1829
01:29:32,531 --> 01:29:35,380
you know,
whatever possibilities they have now,

1830
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:36,850
it's you,
you,

1831
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:40,990
you just try to extrapolate.
You try to add up the steps between now

1832
01:29:40,991 --> 01:29:45,400
and fIve to 10 years from now.
It's going to be really weird.

1833
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:47,750
Did you see the darpa,
one of the darpa announcements that

1834
01:29:47,751 --> 01:29:48,820
we're talking about?
All the different.

1835
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,200
Well,
it wasn't an announcement.

1836
01:29:50,201 --> 01:29:53,170
There were,
it was an interview they did with one of

1837
01:29:53,171 --> 01:29:55,450
the guys.
I tweeted it so you could find it on my

1838
01:29:55,451 --> 01:30:00,050
twitter timeline,
but they're essentially saying the new,

1839
01:30:00,130 --> 01:30:02,780
uh,
inventions over the next,

1840
01:30:02,781 --> 01:30:04,420
uh,
12 months,

1841
01:30:04,421 --> 01:30:08,200
we're just going to blow people's minds.
So apparently they're working on some

1842
01:30:08,201 --> 01:30:11,860
really heavy duty stuff when it comes to
neural implants.

1843
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:14,560
Things along those lines,
I think he was mentioning

1844
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:21,850
is darpa's biotech chief says 2017 will
blow our minds.

1845
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:26,380
Air quotes
the pentagon,

1846
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:28,850
pentagon is research and development
division.

1847
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:33,050
The creative force behind the internet.
And gps retooled itself three years ago

1848
01:30:33,051 --> 01:30:38,051
to create a new office dedicated to
unraveling biology's engineering

1849
01:30:38,061 --> 01:30:42,410
secrets.
The new biological technologies office

1850
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:47,510
has a mission to harness the power of
biological systems and design new

1851
01:30:47,511 --> 01:30:51,750
defense technology.
They're gonna make terminators right

1852
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:56,090
over the past year with a budget of
about $296 million dollars.

1853
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:59,990
It has been exploring challenges
including memory improvement,

1854
01:30:59,991 --> 01:31:04,991
human machine symbiosis and speeding up
disease detection and response.

1855
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:07,370
Fuck dude.
Listen to what that says.

1856
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:12,390
Human machine symbiosis there making up
fucking terminator.

1857
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:15,970
They're gunna make a terminator 100
percent.

1858
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:20,290
If someone comes along and one of the
first pieces of artificial intelligence

1859
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:24,940
is a soldier of machine soldier that
makes no mistakes,

1860
01:31:24,941 --> 01:31:26,620
feels no emotion,
does everything.

1861
01:31:26,621 --> 01:31:31,621
It's told consent back data in four k in
real time and you watch a screen through

1862
01:31:33,101 --> 01:31:35,560
its eyes and tell what to do and it's
invincible.

1863
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:38,940
What?
Of course they're going to build that.

1864
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:42,690
Why would we just send those to mars?
We would probably,

1865
01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:45,330
but people want to go to mars because
they want to be the first.

1866
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:49,710
You know here we're doing yoga and
maurice were all amazing.

1867
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,930
Like I saw a couple of those,
a unit,

1868
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:56,620
they're not brand new but like a robot
assistance essentially where it's like a

1869
01:31:56,870 --> 01:32:01,180
a laptop or an ipad screen that's
attached to a droid or a little robot

1870
01:32:01,210 --> 01:32:04,450
and there's someone on there talking to
answer your questions or whatever and

1871
01:32:04,451 --> 01:32:05,980
they can control it.
Moving arounD the room.

1872
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,550
Have you ever seen those?
No,

1873
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:10,150
I've walked.
I kind of just walked by and I thought

1874
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:12,400
it was funny because there was three of
them people were talking to and there's

1875
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:15,260
just one guy no one was talking to and
he just looked bored.

1876
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:18,970
Like moving around like someone talking
about someone talk to me.

1877
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:23,100
What was the most impressive thing for
you at the event?

1878
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:24,490
Man?
Honestly,

1879
01:32:24,491 --> 01:32:26,070
that I'd have to.
It was weird.

1880
01:32:26,071 --> 01:32:27,810
I probably just because I was looking
for,

1881
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:30,190
but that camera,
that three d stereoscopic camera,

1882
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,470
three 60 camera,
but again,

1883
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:37,500
I'm not sure if what I was seeing was
the rendered video because that's

1884
01:32:37,601 --> 01:32:40,240
specifically what I kept asking to see
when I would walk up to one of these

1885
01:32:40,241 --> 01:32:41,074
guys.
I didn't want to.

1886
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:42,340
I don't,
I don't want to be pitched.

1887
01:32:42,341 --> 01:32:44,470
I just want to see what your rendered
video looks like.

1888
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:49,630
What does the output.
MosT of what I was seeing wasn't great

1889
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:52,660
or didn't look better than what's
currently on the market except for that.

1890
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:56,560
And then a couple of didn't even do
audio or you couldn't mix audio into it.

1891
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:58,870
And for our purpose,
which is I was looking for it to help

1892
01:32:58,871 --> 01:33:01,900
here in the future.
I was trying to knock that out.

1893
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:04,930
Um,
there were a couple of car things.

1894
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:10,020
Mostly just the bmw 7:50,
the coolest one.

1895
01:33:10,241 --> 01:33:13,220
They were showing those off there.
They're also doing test drives with like

1896
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:15,940
[inaudible] and I think some of the self
driving cars maybe

1897
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,360
I think the sevenfifty drives itself to.
I think that's the big one that does,

1898
01:33:19,361 --> 01:33:22,300
but I believe it makes you put your hand
on the wheel,

1899
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:26,820
but it'll drive,
which is even freakier like imagines

1900
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:29,710
driving for you.
But the idea is like if it fucks up,

1901
01:33:29,711 --> 01:33:31,780
but what am I doing then why does my
hands here?

1902
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:32,763
I didn't see it.

1903
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:35,240
right.
I didn't take it on a test drive myself,

1904
01:33:35,241 --> 01:33:38,360
but they had one sitting out that you
could like get in and just kinda like

1905
01:33:38,361 --> 01:33:41,270
sit in and whatnot with all the extra
screens everywhere.

1906
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:43,610
But the backseat,
which probably is,

1907
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,140
I don't,
I probably just didn't know this.

1908
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:48,760
It's basically like a first class luxury
seat like that.

1909
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:51,080
You could lift your feet up,
stick on the back of the seat.

1910
01:33:51,081 --> 01:33:53,070
There was a place for them to have
massage or.

1911
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:54,080
yeah,
it was insane.

1912
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:56,900
Yeah.
They give you a back rub or massage.

1913
01:33:57,080 --> 01:34:01,370
I don't know if it's a new hot
technology right now or if some

1914
01:34:01,371 --> 01:34:05,570
companies are very smart knowing people
are walking around this event tired and

1915
01:34:05,571 --> 01:34:09,890
need a massage,
but the lines for massage chairs at ces

1916
01:34:09,950 --> 01:34:10,783
were insane.

1917
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:11,980
Well,
think about this jamie.

1918
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:13,850
You run all the time.
Yeah,

1919
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,520
I mean how many miles a week do you run?

1920
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:17,700
Oh no,
I haven't been doing it very often,

1921
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:20,610
but at my height probably 30,
but maybe 10,

1922
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:23,350
10 a week now what's going on with you
now?

1923
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:25,400
I just kinda weight training instead of
running.

1924
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:25,920
Oh,
again,

1925
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,100
yoked,
young.

1926
01:34:27,101 --> 01:34:31,600
Jamie getting swole.
My point is you're a very fit guy and

1927
01:34:31,601 --> 01:34:35,170
you exercise on a regular basis,
so for you to walk 25 miles,

1928
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,710
if that's a strain for you,
imagine what it is for a bunch of these

1929
01:34:38,711 --> 01:34:40,090
fatties.
No fence,

1930
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:41,020
no need to fat.
Shame.

1931
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:43,390
You know what,
you are no big deal.

1932
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,060
You know,
I mean it's,

1933
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:50,080
it's got to be really fucking hard.
If you are really poorly fed,

1934
01:34:50,110 --> 01:34:53,140
you know you're eating a bunch of shitty
food and you're out of shape and you're

1935
01:34:53,141 --> 01:34:55,230
overweight and you're walking around
ces,

1936
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:57,250
geeked out of your mind on caffeine.
Yeah,

1937
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:58,880
it's probably a good start for the new
year.

1938
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,790
So you just keep that going.
Walk 10 miles a day.

1939
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:06,350
Every day you'll.
That way it'll peel off you find a hill

1940
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,890
unless you live in Iowa or you know,
some flat spot.

1941
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:11,600
Find a fucking hill.
Walk up hills.

1942
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:14,510
It's hardest thing.
Just got one right in front of my house.

1943
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:16,610
It's amazing.
Two hundred yards up hill to take a

1944
01:35:16,611 --> 01:35:18,530
backpack.
Throw some fucking sandbags in the

1945
01:35:18,531 --> 01:35:21,560
backpack.
Walk up the hill and then get off the

1946
01:35:21,561 --> 01:35:23,840
trail,
like get off the trail and just walk up

1947
01:35:23,841 --> 01:35:26,480
the hill hill like walk up the grass and
the dirt.

1948
01:35:26,481 --> 01:35:28,610
So it slides and you have to correct
yourself.

1949
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:30,260
It's one of the best workouts you can
do.

1950
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:33,620
I,
I was in pretty fucking good shape the

1951
01:35:33,621 --> 01:35:36,180
first time.
Everyone hiking with steve rinella when

1952
01:35:36,181 --> 01:35:40,380
we went hunting and just following him
walking up hills.

1953
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,630
Did we die?
It's the second time it's happened.

1954
01:35:43,230 --> 01:35:46,720
It's the video still recording,
but the stream is just Putting.

1955
01:35:47,370 --> 01:35:49,320
So if,
Do you think it'S um,

1956
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:54,120
the machine or is it the connection with
youtube we don't know.

1957
01:35:54,930 --> 01:35:56,640
Did you find,
speaking of which,

1958
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:01,670
did you find any new a streaming
solutions because right now for people

1959
01:36:01,690 --> 01:36:04,380
don't know.
We're using a tricaster setup and it's

1960
01:36:04,381 --> 01:36:07,470
okay.
It's really good for tHe most part,

1961
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:11,210
but it has fucked us in the ass at least
three or four times.

1962
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:11,940
Pretty hard

1963
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:14,340
there.
There wasn't a lot of stuff because it's

1964
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:16,920
again that was the consumer show so
there's not.

1965
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:21,090
Consumers aren't really out here
streaming for four or five different

1966
01:36:21,091 --> 01:36:24,030
devices at once and all that.
But I did find a couple of things that

1967
01:36:24,031 --> 01:36:29,010
were close that I don't know.
There were upgrades of stuff we used to

1968
01:36:29,011 --> 01:36:29,844
use

1969
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,590
couple of years ago.
Well If you think about how many

1970
01:36:32,591 --> 01:36:34,330
episodes we have,
what are we on?

1971
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:37,300
Like 880 episodes.
Ninety six.

1972
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,200
Okay.
There you go.

1973
01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:40,400
Outside.
Plus a little slight tension.

1974
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:42,970
Eight 96.
So think about that.

1975
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,320
Eight hundred 96 episodes and it's shit
out.

1976
01:36:47,321 --> 01:36:49,720
How many times a day

1977
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,670
knocked down to that?
$400.

1978
01:36:52,671 --> 01:36:55,480
So on here and just brush it out four or
five times.

1979
01:36:55,730 --> 01:36:57,680
That's not good.
One.

1980
01:36:57,730 --> 01:36:59,390
One percent.
That's not good.

1981
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:02,080
Yeah,
It was not very good.

1982
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:03,590
It shouldn't at all.
That's way.

1983
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,920
That's way too often.
I mean maybe we're fucked up.

1984
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:10,190
Maybe we did something wrong.
Maybe a.

1985
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:12,710
I don't know.
Maybe our machine just got a weird bug

1986
01:37:12,711 --> 01:37:13,544
to it.
YeaH,

1987
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:16,210
I dunno.
I mean I reset it multiple times and I

1988
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:19,660
have problems.
I do the protocol of update.

1989
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:21,650
Do you think it's just because it's long
term.

1990
01:37:21,651 --> 01:37:24,680
You were doing these for hours and hours
at a time and heats up.

1991
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:27,700
We do stressed the hell out of it.
Yeah.

1992
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:29,500
If you think about like what we do and
company.

1993
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,930
You know what my frIend justin I know
was doing the action report.

1994
01:37:32,931 --> 01:37:33,740
Same thing,
right?

1995
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:35,480
Yeah.
He was streaming for six hours at a

1996
01:37:35,481 --> 01:37:36,340
time.
I can,

1997
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:38,530
yeah.
I think every time I think that I find

1998
01:37:38,531 --> 01:37:39,910
another comparison.
It's like,

1999
01:37:39,911 --> 01:37:42,760
well,
they'll do just about as long justin.

2000
01:37:42,761 --> 01:37:44,950
I don't remember having any problems
with his system.

2001
01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:48,030
Maybe we got a wHack system dude.
It could have been when we went to

2002
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,840
lemans happened with cars from time to
time.

2003
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:53,680
That could have just been some component
in here that was bad that we've gotten

2004
01:37:53,681 --> 01:37:56,040
around working with that now.
It's just

2005
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,650
not gonna work anymore.
Cars are another interesting thing.

2006
01:37:58,651 --> 01:38:01,530
Along the same lines when we were
talking about earlier about technology

2007
01:38:01,531 --> 01:38:05,610
is that it's reaching this point where
like is way too much car for like what

2008
01:38:05,611 --> 01:38:08,310
you need.
Like they're putting out these cars.

2009
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,331
Right?
Right.

2010
01:38:09,331 --> 01:38:12,180
Out of gm,
like they have this new camaro.

2011
01:38:12,181 --> 01:38:14,010
Have you seen the camaro zl one?

2012
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:17,730
It is.
It's insane.

2013
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:21,300
I think it has fought.
I don't know how many horsepower it has.

2014
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:22,141
Final,
how many horsepower?

2015
01:38:22,141 --> 01:38:24,300
It has.
Fifty six,

2016
01:38:24,301 --> 01:38:25,680
58.
jesus christ

2017
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:32,720
and it's got a corvette z o six engine
in it with a supercharger.

2018
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:38,850
Wow.
It's an unbelievable car.

2019
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:41,820
Like this is a zero to 60 sub four
seconds.

2020
01:38:41,821 --> 01:38:44,760
Zero to 60 car,
massive,

2021
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:45,613
uh,
all that.

2022
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:49,020
See that stuff in the front.
That's all designed to keep the body

2023
01:38:49,021 --> 01:38:52,050
down.
All those aerodynamic little flares and

2024
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:56,910
stuff does design for downforce so that
this thing can go fucking screaming up

2025
01:38:56,911 --> 01:38:59,640
to like 200 miles an hour.
It's crazy.

2026
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:03,390
You can just buy that in a store where
you could go to the chevy dealership and

2027
01:39:03,391 --> 01:39:08,040
buy one of the most competent sports
cars ever created.

2028
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:11,820
Like that car.
You remember those ferrari's from a few

2029
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,670
years ago?
Like a three 60 mo,

2030
01:39:13,671 --> 01:39:14,760
dana,
or uh,

2031
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:15,810
you know the one after that?

2032
01:39:15,810 --> 01:39:19,470
Four or five slash eight.
Those beautiful ferrari dad fucking car.

2033
01:39:19,471 --> 01:39:21,690
We'll burry one of those things.
I mean,

2034
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:23,540
into the dirt.
Good.

2035
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:26,040
Suck my dick.
Kiss my ass.

2036
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:28,170
America.
Fuck yeah.

2037
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:31,930
Screaming the entire time I'm off.
Fuck yeah.

2038
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:34,680
And it's $65,000.
$70,000.

2039
01:39:35,190 --> 01:39:39,000
Yeah.
That car is american muscle at its

2040
01:39:39,001 --> 01:39:44,001
finest plus technology because you know,
real american muscles kind of loose and

2041
01:39:45,031 --> 01:39:47,230
crazy real man.
Like if you get like,

2042
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:50,490
if you bought a real 19,
69 mustang,

2043
01:39:50,491 --> 01:39:55,170
mach one,
I mean there are a gorgeous car.

2044
01:39:55,171 --> 01:40:00,171
I mean it is a stunning piece of art,
but if you had a drive it today,

2045
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:01,790
you would,
uh,

2046
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:04,440
you would be terrified.
You'd be thinking the entire time.

2047
01:40:04,441 --> 01:40:04,921
like,
oh my god,

2048
01:40:04,921 --> 01:40:09,921
I'm driving a death machine.
Like they're so bad in comparison to a

2049
01:40:10,321 --> 01:40:12,990
brand new mustang.
Like if you bought a brand new mustang

2050
01:40:12,991 --> 01:40:17,060
gt,
which I think you can get for $35,000 I

2051
01:40:17,061 --> 01:40:19,020
think.
I tHink a new mustang gts,

2052
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:24,030
like between 35 and $39,000.
And they are way fast or handle way

2053
01:40:24,781 --> 01:40:29,781
better than anything.
Top of the line from the 19 seventies.

2054
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:33,810
Yeah.
How much does this across to under 35.

2055
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,810
That's crazy.
It's stunning car.

2056
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:41,870
That car is foreign and 20 horsepower.
Four 30 4:35 crazy.

2057
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:46,920
That's a beast of a car for 35 grand.
Sixteen miles a gallon.

2058
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:48,090
Twenty five and a highway.

2059
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:54,090
You see what they've done by continuing
ramp up to specs,

2060
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:58,840
ramp up the litter regular car that you
buy from a dealership is equivalent to

2061
01:40:58,841 --> 01:41:03,220
like one of the best cars ever just 10
years ago or 20 years ago.

2062
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:07,570
So the,
the technology is so ahead of its time

2063
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:13,020
that you go back to 97 and you look at
the cars that were like the top of the

2064
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:16,060
food chain back in [inaudible] 97.
Like they didn't even compare.

2065
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:20,940
There's just nothing like these things
and they're going to keep doing it.

2066
01:41:21,090 --> 01:41:22,130
The only thing that,
like you,

2067
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:27,170
there was some cars from 97 that have
some attributes that people like,

2068
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,170
like um,
those old land cruisers.

2069
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:34,860
If you bought a land cruiser from toyota
in [inaudible] 97,

2070
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:38,670
you essentially got an off road vehicle.
They had two solid axle,

2071
01:41:38,671 --> 01:41:40,920
solid front axle,
solid rear axle.

2072
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:45,210
you could take those things and just
drive up the side of a fucking mountain

2073
01:41:45,211 --> 01:41:47,880
in it with the right tires.
They were crazy beefy,

2074
01:41:47,881 --> 01:41:50,700
like right out of the bat.
And so people to this day,

2075
01:41:50,701 --> 01:41:54,570
they take those cars and they jack them
up and put bigger tires and wheels on

2076
01:41:54,571 --> 01:41:58,470
them and they put corvette engines in
them just because the configuration is

2077
01:41:58,471 --> 01:42:02,220
so durable,
like they don't really make too many.

2078
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:06,150
I mean there's only a few companies that
will make like a real car that you could

2079
01:42:06,151 --> 01:42:09,270
actually take right now,
just go dry like a jeep.

2080
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:12,240
Jeeps are perfect example.
You can take a jeep kind of like right

2081
01:42:12,241 --> 01:42:17,241
off the factory floor and drive to most
places that most cars can't get to or at

2082
01:42:17,431 --> 01:42:19,920
least drive to places that most cars
can't get it too.

2083
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,980
But when you want to get further and
further into it,

2084
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:26,190
they started doing all these crazy
modifications to these things and make

2085
01:42:26,191 --> 01:42:29,250
them so that they could literally just
drive through the woods.

2086
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:32,130
What do you Look up their fellow?
Uh,

2087
01:42:32,970 --> 01:42:36,430
I just remembered this bad ass supercar
that I saw at ces.

2088
01:42:36,431 --> 01:42:39,160
It was three d printed.
Oh jesus.

2089
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:42,010
It's called the divergent,
I think the company that makes,

2090
01:42:42,011 --> 01:42:44,200
it's called divergent three d.
And this is called the blade.

2091
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,150
Oh,
do you sit in the middle,

2092
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:48,110
like a total bad ass?
Oh,

2093
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:50,410
that needs to happen.
I think the whole entire thing is three

2094
01:42:50,411 --> 01:42:52,060
d printing shop.
we're down to the tires.

2095
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:57,660
That is just such a.
That's like the alien from John

2096
01:42:57,660 --> 01:42:58,493
Carpenter movie.

2097
01:42:59,070 --> 01:43:02,130
Not John Carpenter,
ridley scott,

2098
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:06,870
ridley scott's alien.
It's like if he drove a car like it was

2099
01:43:06,871 --> 01:43:09,130
on his planet,
look at that thing one seat.

2100
01:43:10,370 --> 01:43:12,010
Someone would probably sit behind you
to.

2101
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:15,540
I was trying to find the spec to see.
I don't know how weird.

2102
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:19,860
I wasn't sure to either.
They'll fit like was it a car that can

2103
01:43:19,861 --> 01:43:24,030
drive if it's a or if they're just also
add concept of showing like look,

2104
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:29,031
we can put these pieces out in three d
printing because I saw a three d metal

2105
01:43:29,491 --> 01:43:31,590
company,
so a company I was printing stuff and

2106
01:43:31,591 --> 01:43:34,320
metal
it looks like at work.

2107
01:43:34,321 --> 01:43:35,154
So

2108
01:43:36,450 --> 01:43:37,740
these cars today,
man,

2109
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:38,350
it's,
it's,

2110
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:42,180
it's really interesting because they're
backed into this weird corner where how

2111
01:43:42,181 --> 01:43:46,800
much better can they keep getting and
how long before they're all automated

2112
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:49,410
because it seems like just a matter of
time.

2113
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:52,100
It seems like just a few years from now,
they're all gonna be automated.

2114
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:53,750
That's what everyone.
That's what a lot of the companies were

2115
01:43:53,751 --> 01:43:56,270
showing off their automation.
LIke mercedes,

2116
01:43:56,271 --> 01:43:59,460
I think nissan,
toyota and video.

2117
01:43:59,490 --> 01:44:02,910
The video game card company was showing
off a.

2118
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:07,460
I don't know exactly the,
their software I think.

2119
01:44:07,461 --> 01:44:10,250
Are there hardware that was being put
into cars to show you how things are

2120
01:44:10,251 --> 01:44:12,410
being read?
like this is a car,

2121
01:44:12,411 --> 01:44:13,940
this is a light,
this is a person.

2122
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:16,370
Just like how it's being recognized and
whatnot.

2123
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:21,890
I mean it's going to go.
Mercedes was showing it and I think bmw

2124
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:24,950
gotten to a car wreck,
but I don't think it was their

2125
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:28,270
autonomous car.
That car.

2126
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:33,080
And then Fair day we're looking at the
camaro.

2127
01:44:33,081 --> 01:44:35,300
Zl one folks who are just listening or.
Yes,

2128
01:44:35,710 --> 01:44:38,000
there's images of it online.
You can go look at it.

2129
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:41,900
Had the fair dave.
So what's a fair day?

2130
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:43,550
Because didn't,
um,

2131
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:46,490
fisker have a new car too.
They came back,

2132
01:44:46,491 --> 01:44:48,140
right?
The fisker karma.

2133
01:44:48,141 --> 01:44:50,150
But I don't know if they were showing
this at the event.

2134
01:44:50,510 --> 01:44:53,090
So this is an electronic car with
electronic car.

2135
01:44:53,091 --> 01:44:56,480
That was being shown off there.
They had a little issue with like their

2136
01:44:56,481 --> 01:44:58,610
reverse while they were doing their
demos,

2137
01:44:58,611 --> 01:45:00,710
so like again,
one of the problems that doesn't always

2138
01:45:00,711 --> 01:45:03,170
that nothing goes perfect.
I think they tried to announce this last

2139
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:08,170
year and they had some bigger issues so
they ever seen an ad where the president

2140
01:45:08,421 --> 01:45:10,730
of the company stands right in front of
the volvo and it hits,

2141
01:45:10,731 --> 01:45:11,540
it,
hits him,

2142
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:12,770
sends him flying.
It's like,

2143
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:16,130
wait,
this has technology to avoid contact

2144
01:45:16,131 --> 01:45:18,440
with humans and it just fucking runs him
over.

2145
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:22,670
He went flying.
That guy probably broke his hip on that.

2146
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:25,610
It's happened a few times where they've
tried to do things.

2147
01:45:25,611 --> 01:45:28,250
People will stand in front of it trying
to show her husband was working for this

2148
01:45:28,251 --> 01:45:29,084
company.

2149
01:45:32,610 --> 01:45:35,210
Here's the car though.
Woo.

2150
01:45:36,290 --> 01:45:40,110
So they're gonna.
I don't know if they're going to do.

2151
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:44,030
Oh it up on the screen in the background
like this is going to be like a big

2152
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,550
competitor to.
Or tesla car.

2153
01:45:46,551 --> 01:45:47,384
Like a tesla.
Yeah,

2154
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:52,820
I think they're going to be on the
market this year if not already.

2155
01:45:52,821 --> 01:45:55,520
I think you can preorder him now.
Not very good looking,

2156
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:59,510
kinda super sexy looking aT the problem.
Very sexy.

2157
01:45:59,511 --> 01:46:01,310
Look,
that's problem.

2158
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:02,870
Oh,
I like how they have the gangster doors

2159
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:04,640
though.
They have suicide doors in the back.

2160
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:06,730
Yeah.
A lot of them were doing suicide doors.

2161
01:46:06,731 --> 01:46:08,930
The volkswagen had a suicide door.
The doors went up.

2162
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:10,610
We got to.
The door shuts itself to.

2163
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:14,000
How about you save fucking battery power
and let me shut the door.

2164
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:18,230
What does that?
Everybody wants to be like a spaceman

2165
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:21,770
door shut.
She shutting.

2166
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:26,330
Shutting dave.
How's it could shut the door.

2167
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:31,430
That doesn't look good.
You guys had all this time to design

2168
01:46:31,431 --> 01:46:33,680
this thing.
He spent all this money and you made a

2169
01:46:33,681 --> 01:46:37,160
fucking alexis mom car.
Well that happened.

2170
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:39,620
I wanted to sort of ask you that.
I think that was one question.

2171
01:46:39,621 --> 01:46:41,540
So like,
you know when they do a car show the

2172
01:46:41,541 --> 01:46:43,550
show,
let's say that they're going to do one

2173
01:46:43,551 --> 01:46:45,620
this year,
they'll show a car for 20 slash 20 and

2174
01:46:45,621 --> 01:46:49,170
it's going to look super high concept.
by the time it comes out it won't look

2175
01:46:49,171 --> 01:46:50,004
that way

2176
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:53,130
sometimes.
Sometimes you're too well they,

2177
01:46:53,131 --> 01:46:55,200
they,
they smoothed out edges and make things

2178
01:46:55,201 --> 01:46:58,740
cheaper to build and there's a lot of
cars that start out in concept form and

2179
01:46:58,741 --> 01:47:02,400
then when they get ultimately delivered,
they're disappointing,

2180
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,040
you know,
come out with a bunch of different

2181
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:09,270
things that they add to them that just
turned out to be too expensive.

2182
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:12,000
Is that what it is?
They're just try as the same kind of

2183
01:47:12,001 --> 01:47:13,520
idea.
They're just trying something or

2184
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:16,170
Thailand.
The car company to like toyota,

2185
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:20,100
like say if someone comes up with a new.
Toyota has thE most expensive car they

2186
01:47:20,101 --> 01:47:23,790
sell the land cruiser,
that big four wheel drive suv,

2187
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,550
that's their most expensive car.
It's pretty expensive.

2188
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:28,110
It's like,
I think you get one,

2189
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:31,040
they're all loaded.
You only get them one way and they're

2190
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:36,050
like 90 something like $90,000.
So if you're building something that's

2191
01:47:36,421 --> 01:47:41,421
going to get more upscale than that,
then it becomes a bit of an issue.

2192
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:43,860
RighT.
Doesn't that make sense?

2193
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:48,570
I accidentally,
I was looking for toyota supercars as

2194
01:47:48,571 --> 01:47:51,150
this came up in the toyota.
Supra might be coming out again.

2195
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:52,253
Yeah,
no,

2196
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:55,260
that's the question.
Like will it look like this when it

2197
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:56,370
comes out?
You're right.

2198
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:58,530
That's a perfect example.
That's a concept car.

2199
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,170
I think it would probably look a lot
like that because that looks awesome.

2200
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:03,510
I mean if they wanted to make some
money,

2201
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:06,660
but like then all those angles and all
that stuff.

2202
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:09,300
Is it more expensive?
Is it less expensive?

2203
01:48:09,370 --> 01:48:11,040
What know?
What do we do about that wing?

2204
01:48:11,041 --> 01:48:14,220
Has it deploys it mechanical?
How much does that cost?

2205
01:48:14,970 --> 01:48:16,930
You know,
what kind of brakes are we using?

2206
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:21,510
Which kind of it it really.
It gets into this weird area when it

2207
01:48:21,511 --> 01:48:24,330
comes to these cars,
but they also have to be stunning in

2208
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:28,290
terms of their ability because cars
today are off the charts.

2209
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:33,800
WhaT you could buy from a subaru wrx.
Just one of those little subarus that

2210
01:48:34,291 --> 01:48:36,600
has an insane little car,
you know,

2211
01:48:36,601 --> 01:48:38,400
and I don't think those are very
expensive either.

2212
01:48:38,401 --> 01:48:41,250
I think that's in like mustang gt range,
right?

2213
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:44,640
Where it's like in the thirties,
32 to 35.

2214
01:48:44,641 --> 01:48:47,250
I did.
I'm pretty sure take that to 1970 and

2215
01:48:47,251 --> 01:48:51,360
you will destroy any car on the road.
There's nothing comes close to it.

2216
01:48:51,410 --> 01:48:53,460
You would think you were from another
fucking planet.

2217
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,310
If he took that on a race car race car
track,

2218
01:48:56,311 --> 01:48:57,840
you'd be blowing people away.
They'd be like,

2219
01:48:57,841 --> 01:49:02,610
what in the fuck is it?
Just particular car companies are a lot

2220
01:49:02,611 --> 01:49:05,580
of the newer cars getting harder to fix
to where they have to be fixed at a

2221
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:08,280
death by the dealer.
They all have to be fixed by the dealer.

2222
01:49:08,281 --> 01:49:11,280
Everything is computer program now.
They hAve minds,

2223
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:15,450
you know the computer programmer or the
program rather than running the car runs

2224
01:49:15,451 --> 01:49:16,770
a traction control system.

2225
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:22,140
The lane change system of accident
avoidance system.

2226
01:49:22,141 --> 01:49:26,100
Some of them hit the brakes for you.
Some of them alarms go off when you get

2227
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:27,450
close,
so they've got sensors,

2228
01:49:27,451 --> 01:49:31,790
they got cameras,
so getting your car fixed at a local by

2229
01:49:31,791 --> 01:49:34,260
a local guy somewhere and it's not
happening anymore.

2230
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:35,700
Yeah,
that's going to be phased out.

2231
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:38,100
It's going to be all dealerships.
It's going to be like getting your

2232
01:49:38,101 --> 01:49:39,810
computer fixed.
I mean,

2233
01:49:39,811 --> 01:49:44,340
it's really going to be like a super
high tech computer with rubber and metal

2234
01:49:44,430 --> 01:49:46,620
and all this jazz that connects it to
the ground.

2235
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:48,130
That mk

2236
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:49,360
market marquez,
brownlee.

2237
01:49:49,361 --> 01:49:50,680
Mark,
I don't know how you say his name

2238
01:49:50,681 --> 01:49:52,660
actually,
but mkbhd on youtube.

2239
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:54,280
He got up at.
I don't want to do it.

2240
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:55,380
Been here.
Yeah.

2241
01:49:55,410 --> 01:49:57,790
Mark has got a full lemon,
but his.

2242
01:49:57,791 --> 01:50:01,720
He had a tesla issues.
We just got a new tesla and his drive

2243
01:50:01,721 --> 01:50:06,430
train was locking up fixed and then he
got it back and it got locked up again.

2244
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:11,520
Wrong dude to fuck a shitty car.
He should have tested that one first.

2245
01:50:11,970 --> 01:50:13,420
That will cost you some money,
right?

2246
01:50:13,710 --> 01:50:15,730
Yeah.
That kind of gives really good reviews

2247
01:50:15,731 --> 01:50:17,140
to his,
um,

2248
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,960
his online reviews of technology or one
of my favorites him,

2249
01:50:19,961 --> 01:50:22,720
but him and louis from unbox therapy or
my.

2250
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:25,390
There are two of mY favorites.
Yeah man.

2251
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,130
The,
those things are not perfect,

2252
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:29,340
but nothing electronic is,
is,

2253
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:31,450
you know,
what are you going to do?

2254
01:50:31,590 --> 01:50:34,570
Somebody fucks up.
Somebody put it together wrong or some

2255
01:50:34,571 --> 01:50:36,300
issues in the wiring.
Who knows?

2256
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:39,650
Part of why I'm not always super
convinced when someone goes full like

2257
01:50:39,651 --> 01:50:41,570
this is going to be,
this is how it's going to be in the

2258
01:50:41,571 --> 01:50:42,710
future.
It's because we still,

2259
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:45,770
even today with all of this,
the coolest shit we have,

2260
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:50,210
there are still major,
major problems that haven't been fixed

2261
01:50:50,211 --> 01:50:53,390
and I don't,
I don't see full fixes for them.

2262
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:58,110
Like which ones do you think tesla?
It's like if they're going to be fix

2263
01:50:58,111 --> 01:50:59,840
that,
they'll fix it 100 percent.

2264
01:51:00,010 --> 01:51:03,970
Just stop and thinK about how clunky
computers were just a few years ago.

2265
01:51:04,630 --> 01:51:08,050
You know,
just when 1995 windows,

2266
01:51:08,051 --> 01:51:10,570
95 came along.
Think about how clunky the oPerating

2267
01:51:10,571 --> 01:51:12,520
system was.
The blue screen of death,

2268
01:51:12,830 --> 01:51:14,560
you know,
I mean computers were crap,

2269
01:51:14,561 --> 01:51:16,000
but it still happens all the time.
Right?

2270
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:20,050
But not nearly as much as it did.
Then think about how many computers

2271
01:51:20,051 --> 01:51:22,360
operate,
how many things all throughout your life

2272
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:26,260
and how rarely they crash.
If they crashed one percent of the time,

2273
01:51:26,261 --> 01:51:27,640
like the,
you know,

2274
01:51:27,641 --> 01:51:30,100
the tricaster,
we get pissed,

2275
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:34,750
which we're spoiled little babies.
Back then when you had windows 95,

2276
01:51:34,751 --> 01:51:38,500
you had a backup things every 20 minutes
he can fucking kid crashed at any

2277
01:51:38,501 --> 01:51:40,960
moment.
You're sticking in floppy drives and

2278
01:51:40,961 --> 01:51:42,920
backing up files and stuff.
True.

2279
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:45,010
It's better.
It's better now.

2280
01:51:45,011 --> 01:51:48,790
It's going to be better soon and with
whatever the issues that they have with

2281
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:51,460
a tesla cars or maybe it's just one
tesla.

2282
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:56,470
Just somebody fucked up.
Maybe somebody just put a wire in that

2283
01:51:56,471 --> 01:51:58,520
had a scratch and who knows what the
fuck?

2284
01:51:58,790 --> 01:51:59,061
No,
it was.

2285
01:51:59,061 --> 01:52:00,020
I don't know anything.
I don't know.

2286
01:52:00,021 --> 01:52:01,190
I still feel like,
I dunno.

2287
01:52:01,370 --> 01:52:03,800
Maybe it's a senate senate scenic view
of it.

2288
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:05,280
I've had.
Let me tell you this though.

2289
01:52:05,281 --> 01:52:08,040
I've had two of those.
Lexis,

2290
01:52:08,370 --> 01:52:11,880
those big toyota land cruiser trucks,
the lexus f,

2291
01:52:11,890 --> 01:52:14,970
f five,
7:55,

2292
01:52:14,971 --> 01:52:16,680
7:50.
No,

2293
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:18,210
five slash 76.
Five 70.

2294
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:20,430
That's what it is.
The big ass truck.

2295
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:25,440
They fucking never break like nothing
goes wrong with them ever.

2296
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:28,350
I mean ever.
Nothing goes wrong.

2297
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:31,560
They just every morning start it,
drive it.

2298
01:52:31,650 --> 01:52:32,670
Oh,
it needs an oil.

2299
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:34,890
Bring it to the place.
They put the oil and they check

2300
01:52:34,891 --> 01:52:35,940
everything.
EveryThing's great.

2301
01:52:35,941 --> 01:52:36,840
See ya.
Bye.

2302
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:40,290
no problems.
I'll try by range rovers as a brand new

2303
01:52:40,291 --> 01:52:42,840
range rover.
It's got one headlight on fucking smoke

2304
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:44,820
coming out of the hood.
Like what happened?

2305
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:47,960
Like what?
What is the difference between a car

2306
01:52:47,961 --> 01:52:52,961
that's like a super reliable car company
like toyota and a car company.

2307
01:52:53,570 --> 01:52:54,403
You know,
like,

2308
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,560
like if you get a maserati,
you get a maserati because it's

2309
01:52:57,561 --> 01:52:59,610
beautiful.
You don't get a maserati because you

2310
01:52:59,611 --> 01:53:02,810
plan on driving to the fucking moon and
he needed to stay together.

2311
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:06,240
It's not going to.
It's just not.

2312
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:09,730
It sounds awesome.
He started up blah blah blah blah blah

2313
01:53:09,731 --> 01:53:12,050
blah.
But if you get that car,

2314
01:53:12,051 --> 01:53:14,600
you get in it because it's sexy.
You're not getting it because it.

2315
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:16,250
It's well designed.

2316
01:53:17,730 --> 01:53:19,020
OKay.
Yeah.

2317
01:53:19,021 --> 01:53:22,590
I guess I didn't know how I want
everything to be awesome.

2318
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:23,840
No,
I think I just.

2319
01:53:23,950 --> 01:53:25,260
It should have already happened
sometimes.

2320
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:28,230
Like those kids in that lego movie,
everything is awesome.

2321
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:34,820
I didn't see it too.
It's a cute movie.

2322
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:37,460
I saw it with my kids.
My kids love the lego movies,

2323
01:53:37,490 --> 01:53:39,830
but I enjoyed it.
Like I genuinely enjoyed it.

2324
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:40,880
The lego movie was good.

2325
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:42,690
I just saw a commercial for the newer
one.

2326
01:53:42,691 --> 01:53:46,340
I think it's got a batman not on all the
warning look for.

2327
01:53:46,350 --> 01:53:47,183
Okay,

2328
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:49,100
okay.
They're really well written.

2329
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:50,480
They're fun.
I mean,

2330
01:53:50,481 --> 01:53:53,360
you gotta you can't be waiting for
things to be deep,

2331
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:56,143
deep.
Jamie.

2332
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:57,920
Really,
really tired of it.

2333
01:53:57,950 --> 01:54:02,950
I'm a less deep every year for real.
Like I something that ron white said

2334
01:54:03,771 --> 01:54:06,680
when he was on the podcast,
key blind and stay drunk.

2335
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:09,500
Like I'm paraphrasing,
stay drug.

2336
01:54:09,501 --> 01:54:14,501
You keep lying.
I mean in some ways the best way to

2337
01:54:17,331 --> 01:54:21,350
handle things just not go deep.
The deeper you go.

2338
01:54:21,351 --> 01:54:25,550
Like I feel like we're clinging to
simplicity with the last of our

2339
01:54:25,551 --> 01:54:27,710
fingernails.
That's what I think and I think just

2340
01:54:27,711 --> 01:54:30,490
sitting on your fucking back porch,
smoking a cigar,

2341
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:33,680
drinking a glass of lemonade.
I think that's a thing of the past and

2342
01:54:33,681 --> 01:54:38,681
just a few decades I think we're going
to enter into some super bizarre world

2343
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:42,830
that's like darpa is talking about
symbiosis.

2344
01:54:42,831 --> 01:54:46,280
Human computer symbiosis,
mean people complain.

2345
01:54:46,281 --> 01:54:50,120
Now the kids don't go outside their sit,
sitting at home everyday playing x box.

2346
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:55,460
Just imagine what it's going to be like
when we get to these really intense

2347
01:54:55,490 --> 01:54:57,710
augmented and virtual reality spaces.

2348
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:01,610
Are you scared?
No,

2349
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:03,820
I just stopped caring.
I think of that stuff about kids all the

2350
01:55:03,821 --> 01:55:04,870
time.
I don't have one side.

2351
01:55:04,871 --> 01:55:05,860
I can't,
uh,

2352
01:55:05,861 --> 01:55:08,580
I don't,
I don't see the day to day their

2353
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:10,720
interactions and how they're different
to mine,

2354
01:55:10,721 --> 01:55:13,360
but I just compare because my generation
or where I'm,

2355
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:15,070
I just turned 34,
But I just,

2356
01:55:15,071 --> 01:55:17,320
I feel like I've just missed out on so
many things.

2357
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:21,100
The year after I left high school,
they all get a guy like tablet pcs for

2358
01:55:21,101 --> 01:55:22,810
everyone.
It's like literally the year after I

2359
01:55:22,811 --> 01:55:25,210
left.
And like you were tHe last.

2360
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:27,580
Yeah,
it's good talking about you.

2361
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:28,220
Maybe

2362
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:29,270
one day if you have kids.
Yeah.

2363
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,520
My dad grew up,
they didn't even have the tablet pcs in

2364
01:55:31,521 --> 01:55:35,030
the class the year after he got out.
That's when they came in.

2365
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:35,993
Whoa.

2366
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:38,930
But it wouldn't,
I don't know how things would've been

2367
01:55:38,931 --> 01:55:42,230
different had we had them because
whatever we know,

2368
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:43,920
we always had a of people would look
back,

2369
01:55:43,921 --> 01:55:44,100
like

2370
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,500
if I could go back to high school now
with everything I know,

2371
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:48,550
dominate and kill everything.

2372
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:51,220
No,
You do it and you wouldn't be nervous.

2373
01:55:51,700 --> 01:55:53,150
That's why you would dominate.
True.

2374
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:55,170
Yeah.
But if some kid decided to kick your ass

2375
01:55:55,171 --> 01:55:57,100
and still kick your ass,
that would be disturbing.

2376
01:55:57,230 --> 01:55:59,360
But I didn't even mean it.
Like on the whole,

2377
01:55:59,390 --> 01:56:01,910
on the whole thing like that.
I'm just going on specifically,

2378
01:56:01,911 --> 01:56:03,230
uh,
like a technology,

2379
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:05,330
a run.
Like if you had,

2380
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:10,070
if I just took all my computer knowledge
I have now and had an ipad when I was in

2381
01:56:10,071 --> 01:56:13,970
high school and we could communicate
with everyone throughout the whole high

2382
01:56:13,971 --> 01:56:18,971
school all day anytime we wanted to.
Whereas like we had to write and we were

2383
01:56:19,401 --> 01:56:20,840
writing notes.
I still have,

2384
01:56:20,841 --> 01:56:24,890
I found a note from a girl in high
school like not too long ago in a box.

2385
01:56:25,090 --> 01:56:26,270
It's like,
it's a literal note.

2386
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:27,500
Dear jamie.
Yeah.

2387
01:56:27,590 --> 01:56:28,281
Dumb shit.
Oh,

2388
01:56:28,281 --> 01:56:33,281
I missed your touch.
Stupid questions of like what's so check

2389
01:56:34,090 --> 01:56:38,210
here
like that they might write notes still

2390
01:56:38,211 --> 01:56:39,500
today.
That might still be a thing.

2391
01:56:39,501 --> 01:56:41,040
it probably is.
I don't want to be that,

2392
01:56:41,540 --> 01:56:45,440
but like the purpose of it isn't there
anymore.

2393
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:48,350
Yeah,
it's way more text messages to notes.

2394
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:49,250
Yeah.
So this is.

2395
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:52,460
And then a facetiming people.
We couldn't.

2396
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:56,120
That wasn't even a possibility.
We had to literally falling into call.

2397
01:56:56,121 --> 01:56:56,954
Like if I,
if,

2398
01:56:57,250 --> 01:56:59,690
if I was in school with your kids,
it'd be calling your house,

2399
01:56:59,691 --> 01:57:01,200
be like,
hey is so and so home.

2400
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:04,640
Can I talk to them?
They'd go get them and then we get to

2401
01:57:04,641 --> 01:57:06,840
talk for 20 or 30 minutes maybe.
Yeah.

2402
01:57:06,860 --> 01:57:11,690
When was the fIrst year we're skype came
out and people started skyping probably

2403
01:57:11,691 --> 01:57:15,230
within the last 10 years.
There was an ease.

2404
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:17,150
There was light video communication back
then,

2405
01:57:17,151 --> 01:57:18,350
but it was terrible.

2406
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:21,180
Well if that's one of the things that
apple has nailed,

2407
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:26,130
having facetime and its operating system
so you just automatic it automatically

2408
01:57:26,131 --> 01:57:27,380
works,
you know,

2409
01:57:27,410 --> 01:57:29,460
you don't have to download anything,
you have to go get skype.

2410
01:57:29,461 --> 01:57:32,100
like if you have an android phone,
do you have to download skype or does it

2411
01:57:32,101 --> 01:57:32,940
come with your phone?

2412
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:35,310
I
don't know,

2413
01:57:35,311 --> 01:57:37,260
but I think that they have a thing to.

2414
01:57:37,790 --> 01:57:39,850
They have an androId thing to that just
like it.

2415
01:57:39,930 --> 01:57:42,480
But what's fucked up is it doesn't
communicate with the apple thing.

2416
01:57:42,481 --> 01:57:44,610
right?
Like you have to get in like everybody's

2417
01:57:44,611 --> 01:57:45,610
got to come to.

2418
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:48,090
Well there's new apps too.
I mean you can do it through,

2419
01:57:48,210 --> 01:57:51,060
you could do it through facebook now if
there's a new one that's blowing up

2420
01:57:51,061 --> 01:57:53,760
right now called house party,
which you can have like eight people on

2421
01:57:54,230 --> 01:57:56,730
and everyone can be having a video chat.
Yeah.

2422
01:57:56,950 --> 01:57:58,510
So,
buT that's an app that you have to

2423
01:57:58,511 --> 01:58:01,150
download.
Like should be just like a phone call

2424
01:58:01,151 --> 01:58:03,730
should be like phone to phone.
It should be phone to phone,

2425
01:58:03,731 --> 01:58:07,210
coMmunication with android to apple.
It seems silly to me that they go

2426
01:58:07,211 --> 01:58:10,060
proprietary on that.
Apple's got a bunch of really sneaky

2427
01:58:10,061 --> 01:58:11,190
ways to keep you around.
Man.

2428
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:14,650
That I message is one of them.
Facetime is another.

2429
01:58:14,870 --> 01:58:16,330
Um,
uh,

2430
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:18,190
what is it when they,
uh,

2431
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:20,680
airdrops airdrops another one for
images?

2432
01:58:20,710 --> 01:58:23,350
No compression sends it through
bluetooth,

2433
01:58:23,710 --> 01:58:26,890
so amazing for videos and pictures and
stuff.

2434
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:29,920
I don't want to say it's a problem isn't
the right word,

2435
01:58:29,921 --> 01:58:34,921
but that they are like the only record
label basically write or record

2436
01:58:35,021 --> 01:58:39,460
distribution play state control of it.
That's kinda crazy to.

2437
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:42,010
It is well interesting too that

2438
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,020
a lot of musicians complain about that.
They're like,

2439
01:58:44,021 --> 01:58:47,140
apple is the biggest music company in
the world now.

2440
01:58:47,430 --> 01:58:50,260
So strain of every transaction.
Do they really are?

2441
01:58:50,261 --> 01:58:53,580
I'm pretty sure.
Well they when

2442
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:58,990
they definitely want everyone to answer,
there's an answer and it's like,

2443
01:58:58,991 --> 01:59:01,000
well now you're not necessarily happy
with the answer,

2444
01:59:01,001 --> 01:59:02,350
but yeah,
you got one.

2445
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:07,560
It's A very weird company in that regard
because it's also like the loyalest

2446
01:59:08,410 --> 01:59:12,640
apple loyalists are so extreme,
like people who worship at the cult of

2447
01:59:12,641 --> 01:59:15,580
mac and apple,
like I had a conversation with.

2448
01:59:15,581 --> 01:59:18,550
The dude was sincerely bummed out that I
started using a windows computer.

2449
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:20,920
It's like so sad.
He was really sad.

2450
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:22,273
It's like,
come on dude,

2451
01:59:22,410 --> 01:59:24,550
it's fucking computer.
Just a computer.

2452
01:59:25,150 --> 01:59:26,220
Just relax.
You know?

2453
01:59:26,221 --> 01:59:27,400
I do.
I type words.

2454
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:32,770
I'd say boards and I look at porn
and I read dig.

2455
01:59:33,270 --> 01:59:34,330
I read a few things.

2456
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:37,030
It's not a lot of processing power going
on here.

2457
01:59:37,031 --> 01:59:40,060
I'm not making videos,
it's not in it and I,

2458
01:59:40,061 --> 01:59:45,061
I just don't understand why everybody
would get so attached to a company,

2459
01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:49,180
you know,
so brand loyal,

2460
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:52,070
fingered real prep blend,
brand loyalties.

2461
01:59:52,090 --> 01:59:54,310
Real weird.
This chevy country.

2462
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:58,050
Have you listened quietly?
You'll hear for rust and

2463
02:00:04,070 --> 02:00:07,310
so many dorks like that.
Like they have calvin and hobbes like

2464
02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:10,480
he's standing on the chevy logo,
pissing on the ford logo.

2465
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:15,460
Magic put nine on your car.
Mind you being that fucking stupid.

2466
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:18,760
If you're listening to this and you have
that on your car,

2467
02:00:18,761 --> 02:00:21,100
don't change.
Stay yourself man.

2468
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:22,870
It's all right.
Change if you want to,

2469
02:00:23,050 --> 02:00:26,440
but don't worry about me.
What else did you see there?

2470
02:00:26,650 --> 02:00:29,530
Anything else worth discussing?
How many,

2471
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:30,610
how long were you there for?
One day.

2472
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:33,400
I got there friday,
friday and saturday.

2473
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:36,430
And when did you feel the stomach flu
coming on wednesday night.

2474
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:39,190
Oh dude.
FucK man.

2475
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:41,380
Power through.
I was also kinda like wonder.

2476
02:00:41,381 --> 02:00:43,180
I could have just been one of those 24
hour thing are.

2477
02:00:43,190 --> 02:00:44,620
I was like,
I feel like shit now.

2478
02:00:44,810 --> 02:00:46,870
I feel great tomorrow,
so I just went ahead and went.

2479
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:48,350
What was your stomach rumbling?
The whole.

2480
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:50,840
Not the whole thing.
I just flew in a coffin.

2481
02:00:50,841 --> 02:00:53,650
Just felt weak and worn down kind of
thing.

2482
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:55,173
Yeah,
man,

2483
02:00:55,660 --> 02:00:57,550
that makes you aPpreciate feeling
healthy,

2484
02:00:57,551 --> 02:00:58,850
doesn't it?
Like when you.

2485
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:00,130
Are you feeling a little shitty right
now,

2486
02:01:00,131 --> 02:01:00,611
right?
Yeah,

2487
02:01:00,611 --> 02:01:01,720
for sure.
It's not 100 percent,

2488
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:04,120
but you know that feeling where you're
like,

2489
02:01:04,121 --> 02:01:05,040
man,
when I get healthy,

2490
02:01:05,041 --> 02:01:07,420
I'm drinking fucking vegetable juice
every day.

2491
02:01:07,421 --> 02:01:10,930
I'm not fucking around anymore.
I'm limitiNg myself to one glass of

2492
02:01:10,931 --> 02:01:13,780
wine.
No sugar,

2493
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:15,250
no this,
no that.

2494
02:01:15,251 --> 02:01:17,140
I'm going to take my probiotics.
I'm doing yoga.

2495
02:01:17,141 --> 02:01:20,530
Twice a week he started thinking of all
the different ways you can keep yourself

2496
02:01:20,531 --> 02:01:23,700
healthy and being in vegas isn't the
best place to think about that too.

2497
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:26,380
Like the worst.
it's the worst for your soul to your

2498
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:31,120
soul's tugged at the gambling.
I wonder what they'll do there is

2499
02:01:31,121 --> 02:01:33,820
because smoking is smoking weed path,
right?

2500
02:01:34,090 --> 02:01:36,730
So how do you think they might handle
that they're in the Future?

2501
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:37,960
Well,
they're going to have to handle the

2502
02:01:37,961 --> 02:01:40,190
extreme paranoia.
A bunch of stoners going

2503
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:40,821
in there like,
dude,

2504
02:01:40,821 --> 02:01:44,810
I don't want to lose all my money.
They're going to go into those casinos

2505
02:01:44,811 --> 02:01:46,100
and they're gonna.
Well,

2506
02:01:46,101 --> 02:01:48,770
I think if I was running a casino,
I would try to figure out a way to

2507
02:01:48,771 --> 02:01:52,850
capitalize on the stoners.
The Big money that they make apparently

2508
02:01:52,851 --> 02:01:57,620
is those fucking huge disco places like
haka song where they get those dj's to

2509
02:01:57,621 --> 02:01:58,454
come in.
YeaH.

2510
02:01:59,180 --> 02:02:01,460
Somebody was telling us who the fuck was
telling us about this,

2511
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:04,980
how much they get paid.
Is it russell?

2512
02:02:05,170 --> 02:02:07,040
Because russell,
it might've been russell the other night

2513
02:02:07,041 --> 02:02:07,310
because,
you know,

2514
02:02:07,310 --> 02:02:11,600
russell hates those electronic dj's
because he's into like old school hip

2515
02:02:11,601 --> 02:02:15,430
hop dj and he is a dj.
Um,

2516
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:19,250
but when you,
when you hear how much money people pay

2517
02:02:19,251 --> 02:02:22,420
to get into those things,
like some dudes are paying like 500

2518
02:02:22,430 --> 02:02:24,560
bucks each to get into those things.

2519
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:27,250
More than that.
How much more than that?

2520
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:29,170
I feel like a table.
Oh,

2521
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:31,220
if you want to table it,
that's something that needs to get it by

2522
02:02:31,221 --> 02:02:35,000
the bottle for a couple of days and then
paper had to get in and girls get in for

2523
02:02:35,001 --> 02:02:36,410
free,
but guys definitely don't.

2524
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:37,970
Well they were saying at a certain point
in time,

2525
02:02:37,971 --> 02:02:41,630
even girls were had to pay 150 bucKs if
you go late probably.

2526
02:02:41,631 --> 02:02:42,464
Yeah.

2527
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:45,620
That's crazy money.
I mean that is just swarming money and

2528
02:02:45,621 --> 02:02:47,540
then there's all the alcohol money on
toP of that.

2529
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:51,620
Those are probably the biggest
generators of income other than crazy

2530
02:02:51,621 --> 02:02:54,530
gambling guys that just come in and blow
their whole.

2531
02:02:55,220 --> 02:02:56,090
Their whole wad

2532
02:02:57,650 --> 02:03:02,040
a $100 to buy a ticket right now for
this weekend if you it.

2533
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:05,900
That's pretty ahead though.
But yeah that's ahead of time.

2534
02:03:05,970 --> 02:03:07,340
Yeah,
a hundred bucks.

2535
02:03:08,310 --> 02:03:09,190
Alright.
Alright.

2536
02:03:09,670 --> 02:03:10,850
Alright.
Alright.

2537
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:12,133
Alright.
Alright.

2538
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:13,193
Alright.
Alright.

2539
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:16,950
But they have open container laws.
You're allowed to walk around all over

2540
02:03:16,951 --> 02:03:19,770
vegas drinking.
You can buy it anywhere you want.

2541
02:03:19,771 --> 02:03:21,720
You can walk around and drink right in
front of a cop.

2542
02:03:21,990 --> 02:03:23,210
Well here's an interesting thing too.

2543
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:28,490
It's sort of an unspoken thing,
but those hock hassan places,

2544
02:03:28,491 --> 02:03:31,670
all those places,
there's booze flowing for sure,

2545
02:03:31,671 --> 02:03:36,020
but there's also pills,
a lot of those people in the mtma.

2546
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:38,230
How many of those people,
what percentage?

2547
02:03:38,240 --> 02:03:41,570
Like if you could light people up at the
little thought light bulb popped up on

2548
02:03:41,571 --> 02:03:43,190
their head.
When you look down on the dance floor

2549
02:03:43,191 --> 02:03:44,920
and all the different people that are on
mtma,

2550
02:03:45,410 --> 02:03:46,610
what is it?
Like 30 percent?

2551
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:47,950
If you had to guess,

2552
02:03:47,950 --> 02:03:51,170
man,
30 percent is being very reasonable to

2553
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:54,280
go with at least 50,
but I feel like that's even low.

2554
02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:58,040
Yeah.
And it literally might be like 60

2555
02:03:58,041 --> 02:04:01,820
percent of the people on ecstasy.
It's like,

2556
02:04:01,821 --> 02:04:02,750
do you.
Do you roll?

2557
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:04,100
Are you rolling?
No,

2558
02:04:04,101 --> 02:04:05,240
I don't roll.
Wow.

2559
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:07,610
Crazy.
Why are you here?

2560
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:11,490
And
so

2561
02:04:13,070 --> 02:04:14,870
if you a casino,
okay.

2562
02:04:14,930 --> 02:04:18,500
And you know that all these people were
on ecstasy and you start counting all

2563
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:23,680
the pills start counting and we're
missing out on $150,000 a night.

2564
02:04:25,611 --> 02:04:26,570
And ecstasy sales.

2565
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:27,913
Okay.

2566
02:04:29,130 --> 02:04:32,280
Who's selling the ecstasy?
Who's the guy?

2567
02:04:32,700 --> 02:04:34,890
Where's all that coming from?
How's it getting in?

2568
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,410
Who's aware of this?
I didn't have know.

2569
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:40,110
Do they have to know or does it all come
from outside?

2570
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,900
Maybe it's all completely detached.
Maybe they don't want to know.

2571
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:45,780
Maybe they know that they need the
ecstasy in order to keep the business

2572
02:04:45,781 --> 02:04:49,620
running because like,
I don't know.

2573
02:04:49,830 --> 02:04:51,210
See,
here's the thing.

2574
02:04:51,990 --> 02:04:56,970
These rooms where people just get
together and dance with a guy on a

2575
02:04:56,971 --> 02:05:00,000
turntable that's just sort of pressing
play and also electronic music and

2576
02:05:00,001 --> 02:05:03,120
lights.
This is a Recent human phenomena.

2577
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:06,600
it's didn't exist 30,
40 years ago.

2578
02:05:06,601 --> 02:05:08,580
People would.
It was saturday night fever.

2579
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:11,250
Staying,
staying alive.

2580
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:13,950
I mean,
yeah,

2581
02:05:13,951 --> 02:05:16,080
disco balls.
That was like the best light show you

2582
02:05:16,081 --> 02:05:17,130
got.
Oh my god.

2583
02:05:17,131 --> 02:05:18,930
The light goes off the ball.
It's crazy.

2584
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:21,390
Now they're.
They have laser shows.

2585
02:05:21,630 --> 02:05:24,450
The music is insane.
You know it was.

2586
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:26,450
Confetti is getting shot through the
air.

2587
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:29,670
These people have stayed.
Shows the strobes like,

2588
02:05:29,671 --> 02:05:31,980
look at this.
Where's this look?

2589
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:34,580
I don't know.
Random vegas partY.

2590
02:05:34,650 --> 02:05:35,700
Dude,
this is insane.

2591
02:05:35,730 --> 02:05:37,800
I mean,
they're just a visual splendor of it.

2592
02:05:37,801 --> 02:05:40,500
All the,
the led or lcd,

2593
02:05:40,970 --> 02:05:44,340
well actually led rIght?
Light emitting diode displays.

2594
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:49,590
It's crazy,
I mean it's beautiful to look at and all

2595
02:05:49,591 --> 02:05:53,150
these people have glow sticks like that.
When you see glow sticks,

2596
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:56,100
those people were on ecstasy.
Those people are fucked up.

2597
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:59,250
A lot of them,
like a good percentage,

2598
02:06:00,030 --> 02:06:04,140
like look at the size of that place.
A concert that do in the summer called

2599
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:07,050
electronic daisy carnival.
Jesus christ.

2600
02:06:07,120 --> 02:06:10,870
This is also in the middle of the summer
when it's 150 degrees out there.

2601
02:06:10,990 --> 02:06:12,710
Um,
how many people are just dropping dead

2602
02:06:12,730 --> 02:06:15,020
sweat and their dicks off.
They just caught him off and throw them

2603
02:06:15,021 --> 02:06:15,854
in a hole in the desert.

2604
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:20,360
This whole wall is in big led show.
Wow.

2605
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:22,980
So like,
I don't know if you're not what you're

2606
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:25,220
enJoying on there if you're not on mtma
or.

2607
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:26,820
Yeah,
you would still enjoy it.

2608
02:06:27,170 --> 02:06:28,200
We would,
if we were high,

2609
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:31,740
we would enjoy The shit out of that.
you go and smoke a bunch of weed and go

2610
02:06:31,741 --> 02:06:32,530
and stand there.

2611
02:06:32,530 --> 02:06:36,310
Same people would pay the same price as
they pay,

2612
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:39,150
pay for alcohol.
They'd pay foR those for weed if they

2613
02:06:39,151 --> 02:06:41,010
could smoke them and kind of

2614
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:44,830
the problem with smoking in there as
assholes would light people on fire,

2615
02:06:45,130 --> 02:06:46,730
you know?
I don't know if they would do to

2616
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:49,390
displace.
RArely would you find me.

2617
02:06:49,391 --> 02:06:52,780
You can even In a group full of peace
minded hippies,

2618
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:55,870
you're going to find one or two dick
wads and once a white someone's hair on

2619
02:06:55,871 --> 02:06:57,090
fire,
you know,

2620
02:06:57,170 --> 02:06:59,320
dropping ashes on their hair or
something like that.

2621
02:06:59,350 --> 02:07:01,090
So you can't really do it.
And that kind of environment.

2622
02:07:01,130 --> 02:07:01,570
Well,
wHen you're,

2623
02:07:01,570 --> 02:07:05,200
when people are closed in together,
like smoking's fucking dangerous.

2624
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:08,110
Not that dangerous.
You know,

2625
02:07:08,111 --> 02:07:10,360
you like,
you thinking about burns to your face or

2626
02:07:10,361 --> 02:07:12,130
at me,
haven't you been burned by people?

2627
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:12,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

2628
02:07:12,970 --> 02:07:15,580
We all have like accidentally there
cherry drops on you and you're like,

2629
02:07:15,581 --> 02:07:17,410
what the fuck?
And like your hands on fire.

2630
02:07:17,411 --> 02:07:19,870
You don't know why.
It's because some drunk is hovering over

2631
02:07:19,871 --> 02:07:22,120
you with their cigarette while they're
talking and it just drops on you.

2632
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:26,260
That happens.
I mean that's a minor thing.

2633
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:29,080
I mean,
anytime you get a giant group of people

2634
02:07:29,081 --> 02:07:31,000
together like that though,
you run risks,

2635
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:33,520
if they could give away pot,
see

2636
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:37,590
the problem with selling it,
even if you're selling it as you're

2637
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:40,060
going to be responsible for all these
people having heart attacks,

2638
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:43,720
if you give them edibles,
like give them that goddamn spray that

2639
02:07:43,721 --> 02:07:45,970
joey diaz just pumps it his mouth.
like it's nothing.

2640
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:49,660
This stuff is so powerful.
It's so powerful.

2641
02:07:50,050 --> 02:07:51,650
Like it's psychedelic.
It's very,

2642
02:07:51,651 --> 02:07:53,950
it's very much like acid in a lot of
ways.

2643
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:56,050
When you get a high dose of the,
uh,

2644
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:56,740
the,
uh,

2645
02:07:56,740 --> 02:08:00,880
the sprays.
And so if you were doing this experience

2646
02:08:00,881 --> 02:08:02,980
on that mean if you could keep it
together,

2647
02:08:02,981 --> 02:08:05,530
it'd be wonderful.
But a lot of people are going to get

2648
02:08:05,531 --> 02:08:08,530
super paranoid and freak out and have
panic attacks.

2649
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:10,900
And so you don't,
you're gonna want to sell them edibles.

2650
02:08:10,901 --> 02:08:13,270
It's like it's too strong for most
folks,

2651
02:08:14,890 --> 02:08:16,690
especially people that don't regularly
dabble in it.

2652
02:08:16,691 --> 02:08:19,330
They won't know how much to take.
It's not like booze.

2653
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:21,850
Like if someone gives you a shot,
you take a shy,

2654
02:08:21,851 --> 02:08:24,520
like holy shit.
Like you feel it pretty quick,

2655
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:26,650
right?
Someone gives you a couple shots.

2656
02:08:26,651 --> 02:08:27,191
You're like,
oh geez,

2657
02:08:27,191 --> 02:08:28,420
I gotta stop.
I've got to settle down.

2658
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:32,830
Or you go crazy,
but you know what a shot does like a

2659
02:08:32,831 --> 02:08:34,750
couple of sprays.
This who the fuck knows what's going to

2660
02:08:34,751 --> 02:08:36,280
happen?
You don't know.

2661
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:37,810
You're taking a chance.
Hey,

2662
02:08:37,811 --> 02:08:39,070
eat this cookie.
Okay.

2663
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:43,480
You don't know you're taking a chance.
A cookie might be like a shot or it

2664
02:08:43,481 --> 02:08:46,630
might be like a whole bottle of vodka,
you know?

2665
02:08:46,631 --> 02:08:50,260
It might be so much of a hit a,
you're paralyzed and you just want to

2666
02:08:50,261 --> 02:08:52,720
lay in a fetal position on the ground.

2667
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:55,740
So anytime you get a giant group of
people like this,

2668
02:08:55,750 --> 02:08:58,300
alcohol is like the safest bet.
If you're going to sell it to them.

2669
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:02,590
Everybody has how to deal with alcohol,
where they deal with it poorly or not.

2670
02:09:03,130 --> 02:09:05,020
You kind of know the numbers,
you know,

2671
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:06,340
oh,
I had five beers.

2672
02:09:06,341 --> 02:09:08,350
Do don't drive.
You're fucked up.

2673
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:09,220
You know?
Oh,

2674
02:09:09,221 --> 02:09:11,380
I had one shot while you're a 350
pounds,

2675
02:09:11,381 --> 02:09:12,700
you probably barely feel it.
You know what I mean?

2676
02:09:13,090 --> 02:09:15,670
Like we all know what the tolerances
are.

2677
02:09:15,671 --> 02:09:18,250
It's pretty.
It's pretty universally acknowledged.

2678
02:09:19,230 --> 02:09:21,070
I'd love that.
A place like this exists though,

2679
02:09:21,071 --> 02:09:23,110
man,
that these kids can get together and

2680
02:09:23,111 --> 02:09:26,650
just go fucking bananas because you can
make some life decisions in these kinds

2681
02:09:26,651 --> 02:09:29,140
of rooms.
You could decide where you're gonna,

2682
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:31,330
how you're gonna live your life for
real,

2683
02:09:31,630 --> 02:09:35,290
because if you work everyday like Joe
Smith on that fucking construction site

2684
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:40,620
and you show up even with your gold wbc
belt and everyday is hammering nails and

2685
02:09:40,661 --> 02:09:43,480
picking up wood and thinking of the time
you have off.

2686
02:09:44,530 --> 02:09:49,530
Sometimes you can go to a place like
this and you just experienced joy and

2687
02:09:49,721 --> 02:09:54,721
laughter and fun and partying,
and you start to think about your job

2688
02:09:55,931 --> 02:09:57,460
job,
your real job,

2689
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:00,640
and you start to dread it.
You start to really dread It.

2690
02:10:00,670 --> 02:10:03,640
You start to really get sick and you
start to think about all these people

2691
02:10:03,641 --> 02:10:05,380
that are putting on these electronic
carnivals.

2692
02:10:05,381 --> 02:10:07,900
Why can't I do that?
Or you think about something else you

2693
02:10:07,901 --> 02:10:10,090
do.
I got to make a living making furniture.

2694
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:13,510
I love making furniture.
I fucking loved designing it.

2695
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:16,390
I've got to figure out a way to open up
a shop and then maybe something like

2696
02:10:16,391 --> 02:10:17,500
this.
She's these,

2697
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:21,670
these moments when you're away from the
grind and you're just in this fantasy

2698
02:10:21,671 --> 02:10:26,671
land and you hear it
and everyone's on ecstasy and people are

2699
02:10:28,061 --> 02:10:32,290
walking by touching everybody's chest
and everybody's laughing and you just

2700
02:10:32,291 --> 02:10:34,730
realize like,
this is A.

2701
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:35,690
This is all temporary.

2702
02:10:35,690 --> 02:10:39,710
This whole experience is temporary and
I'm wasting so much of my temporary time

2703
02:10:39,711 --> 02:10:44,270
doing bullshit that I don't want to do.
Everybody tells you what law I want you

2704
02:10:44,271 --> 02:10:46,070
to take over the faMily plumbing
business.

2705
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:49,100
I don't want to plumb.
I don't want to clean out anybody's

2706
02:10:49,101 --> 02:10:54,070
broken shitter.
I want to make those led lights that,

2707
02:10:54,110 --> 02:10:57,050
that turned into floatinG mushrooms.
I want to make those.

2708
02:10:57,051 --> 02:10:59,030
Somebody has to make that.
That's a job.

2709
02:10:59,270 --> 02:11:00,650
I have to figure out how to get that
job.

2710
02:11:00,651 --> 02:11:04,130
That would be the shit.
I mean,

2711
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:06,930
all these people that we have to rely on
and we keep the,

2712
02:11:06,931 --> 02:11:08,750
you know,
go to ces every year.

2713
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:10,400
All those people that you have to rely
on,

2714
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:13,700
like all those people pretty much had to
take a chance.

2715
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:16,850
All oF them,
pretty much everybody that's doing any

2716
02:11:16,851 --> 02:11:19,910
of those things where they're putting
out these new technologies and showing

2717
02:11:19,911 --> 02:11:22,450
all this new inventions,
all of them had to be like

2718
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:26,360
disenfranchise or disenchanted with
something and just got to take a chance.

2719
02:11:26,570 --> 02:11:28,760
This is what I want to do and then this
is what I'm going to pursue.

2720
02:11:32,010 --> 02:11:34,260
What else did you find that?
Anything else?

2721
02:11:36,590 --> 02:11:38,880
Because we've got to wrap this up soon.
I think that was honestly,

2722
02:11:38,881 --> 02:11:41,790
I didn't see tons of stuff that was
blowing my mind this year.

2723
02:11:41,850 --> 02:11:44,040
I saw a couple of cool things.
What was the phone?

2724
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:45,891
Oh,
that phone.

2725
02:11:45,891 --> 02:11:48,380
Yeah.
So the interesting thing about it,

2726
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:50,420
I'll try it.
I even had a little bit of my tomato

2727
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:52,610
weiwei.
Weiwei?

2728
02:11:52,850 --> 02:11:53,740
Yeah.
What's,

2729
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:56,090
why way?
What's,

2730
02:11:56,091 --> 02:11:57,440
uh,
is it an android phone?

2731
02:11:57,460 --> 02:11:59,660
Oh yeah.
It does run android thing.

2732
02:11:59,710 --> 02:12:00,760
This is it right there.
yep.

2733
02:12:01,670 --> 02:12:03,500
Why way?
Who makes a weiwei?

2734
02:12:03,570 --> 02:12:06,810
that's the company.
The phone was called like a mate mate

2735
02:12:06,811 --> 02:12:09,240
nine.
I think it's the model of their phone.

2736
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:14,610
I was asking this guy question about it
because it.

2737
02:12:15,030 --> 02:12:20,030
What it does is it has a really good
lens on it or two lenses actually,

2738
02:12:20,790 --> 02:12:24,170
and so it's doing this thing called
aperture and I forget what it was

2739
02:12:24,171 --> 02:12:25,830
actually calling out,
so I'm hitting this button here and

2740
02:12:25,831 --> 02:12:28,230
trying to see what it was going on.
So I was trying to figure out if it's

2741
02:12:28,231 --> 02:12:30,720
actually doing lens blur,
which is what a lot of people were

2742
02:12:30,721 --> 02:12:33,900
always after when they're taking
pictures they want really good blur,

2743
02:12:34,710 --> 02:12:36,660
photo look good.
Which is what that portrait mode and the

2744
02:12:36,661 --> 02:12:37,890
new iphone,
it's kind of all about.

2745
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:42,270
So it keeps the foreground in focus in
the background becomes blurry,

2746
02:12:42,271 --> 02:12:44,940
like a real camera.
So I was just asking if it was actually

2747
02:12:44,941 --> 02:12:48,750
doing it or if it was simulating it
using software and what he say.

2748
02:12:49,530 --> 02:12:52,140
I'm pretty sure he was telling me that
it was stimulating using software.

2749
02:12:52,141 --> 02:12:54,780
That's why he was hitting that button.
That's what I kept putting my hand in

2750
02:12:54,781 --> 02:12:56,550
front of it to kind of see what was
going on.

2751
02:12:56,670 --> 02:12:59,490
So the cool thing about the iphone is it
uses hardware doing that,

2752
02:12:59,491 --> 02:13:00,324
right?

2753
02:13:00,550 --> 02:13:01,120
Yeah,
it's,

2754
02:13:01,120 --> 02:13:04,150
it's using the toolkit as far as I know.
And then again it could be doing some

2755
02:13:04,151 --> 02:13:06,670
other stuff.
It's not the same as me grabbing my dslr

2756
02:13:06,671 --> 02:13:09,990
camera and having a really good lens and
frame the focus point and all that.

2757
02:13:10,330 --> 02:13:11,650
It's not the exact same as that.

2758
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:13,850
So when you,
if you did That with a camera,

2759
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:16,070
you'd be able to tell the difference in
the quality of the image.

2760
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:17,360
That's sorta what I was going.
I was like,

2761
02:13:17,361 --> 02:13:20,780
I kind of should be able to tell.
I feel like just by looking at it,

2762
02:13:20,781 --> 02:13:22,910
if it's real or not,
it didn't look real to me.

2763
02:13:22,970 --> 02:13:24,800
It could've just been a trick and I
might not have been.

2764
02:13:25,590 --> 02:13:27,240
I might've just been looking at
something I didn't,

2765
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:29,430
I think I was seeing.
But uh,

2766
02:13:29,670 --> 02:13:31,820
what are these kids playing here?
What's three d games?

2767
02:13:32,110 --> 02:13:34,170
East sports.
So this is the intel booth.

2768
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:39,200
They're doing a little bit of a there.
This is what an ea sports game situation

2769
02:13:40,021 --> 02:13:42,240
might look like in the future because
this is going,

2770
02:13:42,450 --> 02:13:45,530
there's a tbs is broadcasting a lot of
east sports or some other company's

2771
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:46,410
investing a lot in it.

2772
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:50,100
How come they don't play those games on
ergonomic chairs like these,

2773
02:13:50,490 --> 02:13:52,560
these are ergo depot chairs.
He desert,

2774
02:13:52,710 --> 02:13:56,180
those are ergonomic sort of like race
car chairs,

2775
02:13:56,890 --> 02:13:59,770
but racecar chairs you sit back.
See when you play a game,

2776
02:13:59,771 --> 02:14:02,080
you lean forward just like you use a
computer.

2777
02:14:02,090 --> 02:14:03,230
Some,
some people do,

2778
02:14:03,231 --> 02:14:06,270
most people obviously are leaning for,
but they also have extra pads and um,

2779
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:09,560
so like have your back in certain spots.
But what,

2780
02:14:09,590 --> 02:14:12,200
what's going on here as a,
on the screen above them,

2781
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:15,890
this is a,
their gameplay is being rendered above

2782
02:14:15,891 --> 02:14:18,440
their head so that you can be viewing
this in three d space.

2783
02:14:18,441 --> 02:14:23,180
So if you had a vr headset onto,
you'll be viewing these situations all

2784
02:14:23,181 --> 02:14:25,640
differently in the future.
It's kind of just flows like a concept.

2785
02:14:25,641 --> 02:14:26,590
I'm pretty sure they were showing.

2786
02:14:26,870 --> 02:14:28,840
Do these chairs we use are so good.
I look at other.

2787
02:14:28,890 --> 02:14:30,350
Everybody's sitting in other chairs.
I'm like,

2788
02:14:30,351 --> 02:14:35,351
you poor bitch.
These ergonomic capisce co chairs.

2789
02:14:36,910 --> 02:14:40,280
Um,
do those have haptic feedback or sound

2790
02:14:40,281 --> 02:14:43,250
to come out of them that know those
chairs don't really or anything.

2791
02:14:43,310 --> 02:14:44,780
I'm still doing that window thing.
Huh?

2792
02:14:44,870 --> 02:14:46,400
Where they have the window in the side
of the computer.

2793
02:14:46,401 --> 02:14:48,470
We look in that one I was trying to show
here.

2794
02:14:48,471 --> 02:14:51,130
It has some e ink display going on,
which you can't.

2795
02:14:51,140 --> 02:14:53,450
You could see it moving a little bit.
Oh whoa.

2796
02:14:53,480 --> 02:14:54,313
Oh,
that's dope.

2797
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:56,450
So it just looks cool.
Yeah,

2798
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:58,010
it just looks cool.
Yeah.

2799
02:14:58,011 --> 02:15:01,580
Well they've by having all these
different companies making pcs,

2800
02:15:01,581 --> 02:15:03,840
they opened themselves up to so much
weird innovations.

2801
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,460
One real cool thing,
and again this is one of those things,

2802
02:15:06,461 --> 02:15:11,080
I'm not sure if this is real or not.
This is called a tiny most camera.

2803
02:15:11,650 --> 02:15:14,830
What they're saying this camera does.
It's made specifically for shooting

2804
02:15:14,831 --> 02:15:17,650
outdoor astronomy photos.
It's got google,

2805
02:15:17,710 --> 02:15:22,210
the google star maps built into it.
And the reason I don't,

2806
02:15:22,270 --> 02:15:26,020
I'm not sure on this because I've tried
personally to take photos of stars and

2807
02:15:26,021 --> 02:15:28,600
the moon in different things in the sky
at night.

2808
02:15:28,780 --> 02:15:32,140
It's a really hard to do and like for
for one,

2809
02:15:32,141 --> 02:15:35,290
if you're trying to take a picture of
what they have done here,

2810
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:38,440
which would be like the galaxy where you
can see the different gasses and

2811
02:15:38,441 --> 02:15:40,750
whatnot.
You have to leave your aperture open for

2812
02:15:40,751 --> 02:15:43,090
a long time,
a couple of seconds and let the light

2813
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:45,600
get in there.
The opposite of that,

2814
02:15:45,601 --> 02:15:48,030
if you're trying to take a picture of
the moon and get detailed picture of the

2815
02:15:48,031 --> 02:15:49,760
moon,
you got to go really quick because

2816
02:15:49,761 --> 02:15:51,260
there's so much light coming off of it.

2817
02:15:51,860 --> 02:15:53,720
You have to get this assistance.
Snap second.

2818
02:15:53,990 --> 02:15:55,400
You have to have really good lens and
whatnot.

2819
02:15:55,850 --> 02:15:59,390
This camera is good for both and it's
about the same size as a point and shoot

2820
02:15:59,391 --> 02:16:03,700
camera and it says that they're allowing
you to take all the and I don't know

2821
02:16:03,701 --> 02:16:06,850
exactly how because I couldn't take this
outside myself and play with it.

2822
02:16:06,970 --> 02:16:09,310
WhAt do they say when you asked them to
describe how it works?

2823
02:16:09,311 --> 02:16:10,570
I.
I didn't ask.

2824
02:16:10,571 --> 02:16:13,030
I heard this guy giving a description to
somebody else.

2825
02:16:13,870 --> 02:16:17,260
They didn't really give a great.
This is all the data and this is how

2826
02:16:17,261 --> 02:16:19,600
everything is a,
this is how it actually works.

2827
02:16:19,660 --> 02:16:21,940
They have some,
they have a software which said it was

2828
02:16:21,941 --> 02:16:25,810
like a patent pending on some noise
reduction filters,

2829
02:16:25,811 --> 02:16:30,811
which would be reducing noise on your
photo and sort post after the fact,

2830
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:34,240
which I don't know if that's,
if it's tricking it or if it's just

2831
02:16:34,241 --> 02:16:36,940
removing some of the data from your
picture to make it look like a better

2832
02:16:36,941 --> 02:16:40,510
picture,
but it was being advertised on lots of

2833
02:16:40,511 --> 02:16:44,620
different outlets as this is maybe they
actually got hands on and I didn't and

2834
02:16:44,621 --> 02:16:46,450
they got to see that it was proven so

2835
02:16:46,570 --> 02:16:47,920
well.
It'd be really interesting if it was

2836
02:16:47,921 --> 02:16:49,720
true.
If you could just point a camera up and

2837
02:16:49,721 --> 02:16:51,940
take a picture of the galaxy,
that would be the shit,

2838
02:16:53,950 --> 02:16:55,480
but you would have to have no light
pollution.

2839
02:16:55,481 --> 02:16:56,350
Correct?
I mean it's not.

2840
02:16:56,410 --> 02:16:57,500
No way.
I would see through the law.

2841
02:16:57,530 --> 02:16:58,680
You'd have to go somewhere,
right?

2842
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:00,130
Oh my god.
What is this thing?

2843
02:17:00,490 --> 02:17:04,630
So this is another like vr.
The skies flying around in space.

2844
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:07,460
This is insane.
You were looking at this guy leaning

2845
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:10,820
forward,
he's got his forearms and his hands

2846
02:17:10,821 --> 02:17:13,880
connected to this.
These two handles on the front and the

2847
02:17:13,881 --> 02:17:16,810
back.
His feet are strapped into this thing,

2848
02:17:16,811 --> 02:17:19,780
so he's kind of planking the whole time.
It doesn't look good if there's anything

2849
02:17:19,781 --> 02:17:21,620
on his stomach,
is that correct or is there something on

2850
02:17:21,621 --> 02:17:22,260
his stomach?

2851
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:25,200
I don't think so.
So I think that's hard to do,

2852
02:17:25,201 --> 02:17:26,520
man.
It doesn't look.

2853
02:17:26,550 --> 02:17:28,620
It didn't look like the most comfortable
thing.

2854
02:17:29,230 --> 02:17:31,720
Yeah.
See he's leaning on his forearms and

2855
02:17:31,721 --> 02:17:32,410
he's,
he,

2856
02:17:32,410 --> 02:17:35,080
he's steering himself with his own body
weight.

2857
02:17:35,770 --> 02:17:38,140
Well that would be a fucking vicious
workout man.

2858
02:17:38,700 --> 02:17:40,680
When you're flying.
I don't think he'd be laying on

2859
02:17:40,681 --> 02:17:43,670
something really eat unless you were
flying on like a carpet or.

2860
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,360
You know what I mean?

2861
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:47,330
Well you still like.
It's like his body is not subject to

2862
02:17:47,331 --> 02:17:48,440
gravity,
but his stomach,

2863
02:17:48,441 --> 02:17:53,441
his body's being pulled down.
So you'd have to liKe really develop

2864
02:17:53,481 --> 02:17:54,980
your.
I've bet a lot of people gonna hurt

2865
02:17:54,981 --> 02:17:58,640
their back on that because like you're
going to do it and you're going to strap

2866
02:17:58,641 --> 02:18:01,400
yourself into that thing and you're
going to get to a point where you're too

2867
02:18:01,401 --> 02:18:02,870
exhausted to keep planking

2868
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:06,100
or what it says up here in the corner
underneath their little banner that says

2869
02:18:06,101 --> 02:18:09,370
it's good for exercise your core and
your upper body and all that.

2870
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:10,990
Oh dude,
people are going to be bulletproof.

2871
02:18:11,030 --> 02:18:14,020
They keep doing that.
Like if that's going to be one of those

2872
02:18:14,021 --> 02:18:16,180
dance,
dance revolution type things where

2873
02:18:16,181 --> 02:18:19,660
people start doing it and they get in
shaped because of it because like this

2874
02:18:19,661 --> 02:18:23,350
looks really hard to do.
You remember that thing that we had on

2875
02:18:23,351 --> 02:18:28,351
the podcast that we reviewed that frog.
You remember the frog,

2876
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:31,150
brent?
I believe shop was telling us about it,

2877
02:18:31,660 --> 02:18:36,580
but it's a a weight thing that you do.
Will you move your body forward and

2878
02:18:36,581 --> 02:18:37,970
backward?
Yes.

2879
02:18:38,350 --> 02:18:40,600
It's like a.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2880
02:18:40,601 --> 02:18:44,140
And you actually move forward and
backward with it.

2881
02:18:45,270 --> 02:18:50,260
I think it's called the frog,
but it looks remarkably similar to that

2882
02:18:50,261 --> 02:18:55,261
thing.
So imagine if you have a game where you

2883
02:18:55,421 --> 02:19:00,220
put virtual reality headsets on and you
do that frog workout thing.

2884
02:19:01,540 --> 02:19:02,373
You can't find it.

2885
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:05,110
Give it a try.
I typed in frog and it's just given me

2886
02:19:05,111 --> 02:19:06,790
pictures of frogs lifting weights and
stuff.

2887
02:19:08,110 --> 02:19:10,600
What about frog?
Weightlifting equipment?

2888
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:13,160
The frog.
The bull frog?

2889
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:15,190
No.
Is that it?

2890
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,640
What it is,
folks is you know that the way a frog

2891
02:19:18,641 --> 02:19:23,641
looks when it's moving across water,
when it has those kicks with its back

2892
02:19:23,981 --> 02:19:26,560
legs and it's four legs and they come
together and then they go apart.

2893
02:19:26,561 --> 02:19:27,920
Frog fitness.
There it is.

2894
02:19:29,290 --> 02:19:33,550
And this thing is this weird.
It's got wheels in the front and wheels

2895
02:19:33,551 --> 02:19:37,990
on the back and you connect your feet to
the base of it and your upper body to

2896
02:19:37,991 --> 02:19:40,080
the front of it.
SkuchA heads.

2897
02:19:40,100 --> 02:19:41,710
We could see these guys doing this.
You look,

2898
02:19:41,711 --> 02:19:45,370
I got a football,
but it's a serious piece of workout.

2899
02:19:45,371 --> 02:19:49,450
See here you see this guy moving with
this thing back and forth and back and

2900
02:19:49,451 --> 02:19:51,770
forth,
and uh,

2901
02:19:53,420 --> 02:19:55,880
I think you can change the resistance in
those cables.

2902
02:19:55,881 --> 02:20:00,881
You can make it more difficult to do and
apparently it gets you in sick shape.

2903
02:20:03,640 --> 02:20:07,000
I've heard a lot of people talking about
this thing saying it's a tremendous

2904
02:20:07,210 --> 02:20:09,880
piece of a strength and conditioning
equipment by open.

2905
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:11,013
Yeah,
it's 1:30.

2906
02:20:11,150 --> 02:20:12,490
All right.
We'll bring in hunter mott's.

2907
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:16,690
That'll be a podcast too.
But imagine doing this with like handles

2908
02:20:17,410 --> 02:20:21,670
virtual reality and you're doing a game.
I mean these guys are crawling along

2909
02:20:21,671 --> 02:20:22,504
with this thing.

2910
02:20:23,710 --> 02:20:27,310
Imagine if you're doing this,
but you think you're flying a spaceship

2911
02:20:27,770 --> 02:20:31,490
and you're shooting shit.
We need to Just need to get virtual

2912
02:20:31,491 --> 02:20:34,640
reality in a bigger Spaces so we can be
moving around and be playing with each

2913
02:20:34,641 --> 02:20:35,840
other.
I think that's a big,

2914
02:20:36,170 --> 02:20:37,350
big gap.
We need still to,

2915
02:20:37,360 --> 02:20:38,240
to be fixed.
Yeah.

2916
02:20:38,270 --> 02:20:39,340
Football fields.
Yeah.

2917
02:20:39,470 --> 02:20:41,640
Virtual reality on football fields.
