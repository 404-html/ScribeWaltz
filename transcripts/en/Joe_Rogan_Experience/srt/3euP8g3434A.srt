1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
Okay.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,913
Yeah.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,940
Ah,

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,740
birds already got the top off the vodka.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,090
I want to cleanse your,

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,520
yeah,

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:20,791
dude,

8
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,361
I'm telling you.

9
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:21,930
Ready for this?

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,430
Yes.

11
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,370
Todd could cleanse.

12
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,040
Well,

13
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,900
it's is clear.

14
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:25,711
Oh,

15
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:26,544
it's good for you.

16
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:26,760
No,

17
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,360
it's clear.

18
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,193
Anything clear?

19
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,950
That's my,

20
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,551
I don't know Joe.

21
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:30,420
I'm fucking not clear.

22
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:31,254
Like Tequila.

23
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,460
Tequila is on the cleanse.

24
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,260
It was meth by the way.

25
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,041
It's pretty clear,

26
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:35,874
right?

27
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,110
Clear good math.

28
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:38,370
And that's hard to come by these days.

29
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,050
Um,

30
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:39,883
ever clear.

31
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,920
That's not good for you,

32
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:41,311
right?

33
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:41,910
That's clear.

34
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,650
Acid moonshine.

35
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,030
That's clear it.

36
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,540
This is the doing strings.

37
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:46,781
It's,

38
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,110
it's a different approach to a Clintons.

39
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:50,731
No,

40
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,660
I talked to you the other day.

41
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:53,670
I was 55.6.

42
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:55,050
This is the most hilarious conversation.

43
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:55,884
Burke calls.

44
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,671
It goes,

45
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:57,780
I'm cleaning up my life.

46
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,560
That's it.

47
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:58,951
He goes,

48
00:00:58,951 --> 00:00:59,784
I'm too heavy.

49
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,151
I go,

50
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:00,690
what are you going to do?

51
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,140
He goes,

52
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,220
no more appetizers.

53
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,740
And he was serious.

54
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,180
I wasn't joking.

55
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:08,900
Get all serious like appetizers
where it's doing yet.

56
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:09,710
Dude,

57
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,490
I make it rain appetizers.

58
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:12,241
When I sit down,

59
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:12,870
I'm like,

60
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,141
I go,

61
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:13,650
first of all,

62
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,251
every time.

63
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:15,540
What are your two best appetizers?

64
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:15,960
And they're like,

65
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,200
Yup,

66
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,441
I go,

67
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:17,410
we want those good.

68
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,210
Why not?

69
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:18,540
Right.

70
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:18,990
Okay,

71
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,860
well a little taster,

72
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:20,620
right?

73
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,160
Here's where I really got and here's
where the weight gain really came on.

74
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,650
Anyone that really that's been
working with me knows this.

75
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,790
I owed her two meals.

76
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,950
I order two meals cause I
like to eat like a king.

77
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:29,850
I'm not paying for it,

78
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,550
but so like you're not paying for
it and that work's paying for it.

79
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,400
It's Oh,

80
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:33,871
creator.

81
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:35,670
So you're assuming like all your meat,

82
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,690
that's how much you work,

83
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:36,991
man.

84
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:37,890
You work so much.

85
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:40,080
Most of your meals are paid for.

86
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:40,710
I haven't had,

87
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,800
I haven't paid for a meal in 11 months.

88
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,790
That's so crazy.

89
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,550
I've been on the road straight
for 11 fucking months.

90
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,180
Dude.

91
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,570
Nobody I know travels as much
as you other than Bordain maybe.

92
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,404
He's pretty close.

93
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,800
He's travels a fucking Dick load and
he goes to like all over the mirror.

94
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,951
Well,

95
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:58,380
he goes a horrible places
that are like really scary.

96
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,930
I think that's the reason he left the
travel channel is that they wouldn't let

97
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:01,770
them go to those places.

98
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,963
I don't know.

99
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,361
No,

100
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:03,510
no,

101
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,820
no.

102
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,653
I was pretty certain.

103
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,070
Really?

104
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,220
Yeah.

105
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,880
Cause uh,

106
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,570
cause CNN has a different set of
insurance and travel channel's insurance

107
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:12,960
doesn't cover like they're like
dangerous skateboard shipping type shit.

108
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,360
It doesn't cover it pretty
much your own insurance.

109
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:16,530
Almost his last episode,

110
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:17,311
he was in the Congo.

111
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,061
I haven't watched it yet,

112
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:20,850
but I saw the Congo and I
was way too hard to watch it.

113
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,541
I was like,

114
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,171
no,

115
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:22,711
don't,

116
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:23,700
can't do it.

117
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,593
No.

118
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,800
I did a Montana episode with
him a couple of weeks ago.

119
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,101
Yeah,

120
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:30,210
we camped out too.

121
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,130
We did the full Montana experience,

122
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:35,520
went pheasant hunting
and then we camped out.

123
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,020
Hung out by the fire,

124
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,093
got lit up.

125
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,393
It was fun.

126
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,790
So wait,

127
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,010
does he drink camping?

128
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,590
Oh yeah.

129
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,240
We went hard.

130
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,040
We weren't hard boozing.

131
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,210
We'd everything.

132
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,920
We went hard.

133
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,740
Anthony Bordain to not fuck around.

134
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,690
You know what's really incredible?

135
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,010
That guy's addicted to Jujitsu.

136
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,550
Yeah.

137
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,440
90% of what he was talking about,

138
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,130
he just wanted to talk

139
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,000
about Jujitsu.

140
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,380
He started when he was
like 58 or 57 years old.

141
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,620
Now he's 59 and he just everyday trains.

142
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,760
He trains when he's on the road,

143
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,560
he goes to these places like Bozeman,

144
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,394
Montana,

145
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,630
and he finds like a local group of guys
and he goes and rolls at these guys.

146
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,913
He's a madman.

147
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,151
A wife.

148
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:19,930
Get him into it.

149
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,381
Yeah.

150
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:22,450
His wife is super into it.

151
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,740
Super into it.

152
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,603
She's uh,

153
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,200
she's constantly training.

154
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,090
Like I think she trains like twice a day,

155
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:28,924
every day.

156
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,823
Wow.

157
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,450
Now that's good for him.

158
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:31,871
And he looks,

159
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:32,704
he looks good.

160
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,543
It doesn't look like a,

161
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,290
he doesn't look like
the way he should look.

162
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,310
He's one of the clearings.

163
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,240
And you're in the mine.

164
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,541
Yeah.

165
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,970
He looks a lot better than he
looked just a few years ago.

166
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,750
Smoking cigarettes.

167
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,080
No,

168
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,231
no.

169
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,670
He stopped when his daughter was born.

170
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,450
Wow.

171
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,920
Except for the occasional one.

172
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,490
He'll cheat.

173
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:45,821
You know,

174
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:46,600
I think,

175
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:46,991
but uh,

176
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,190
I don't even think he does that anymore.

177
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:49,690
And now that he's doing Jujitsu,

178
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,611
I'm sure he does it.

179
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:50,771
You know,

180
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:54,640
what happens with the Jujitsu world with
the lifestyle is you get those become

181
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:55,630
your new friends.

182
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,130
Like those become like it and it becomes
like a Jujitsu family and like they

183
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,130
understand you more than other people
understand you because they've choked you,

184
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:03,881
you know,

185
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:04,180
and you've,

186
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,110
you've gone to,

187
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,530
to battle together an intimacy
when someone chokes you out.

188
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,610
Like a bizarre,

189
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:11,380
like I held you in my hand.

190
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,980
Yeah.

191
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,581
I could've let go.

192
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:13,780
You and I decided to keep you.

193
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,590
Yeah,

194
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,423
definitely.

195
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,480
There's definitely something there.

196
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,470
And then it also like makes
regular life seemed kind of boring,

197
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,161
you know,

198
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,880
so they'd just get engulfed into that
world and some people they wind up doing

199
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,830
that to the point of
that becomes their job.

200
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,820
They ended up teaching it.

201
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,020
I know a lot of people have left lucrative
careers because they decided they

202
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,550
wanted to start teaching Jujitsu.

203
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:34,550
Yeah.

204
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,890
And they just got into it a lot.

205
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:36,371
They were doing it,

206
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:40,540
they started teaching private lessons
and then they just downsized and started

207
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,111
doing Jujitsu.

208
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:41,351
They're like,

209
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:45,070
this is just so much more fun than being
some guy trying to climb the corporate

210
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:45,904
ladder.

211
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,751
Is there,

212
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:47,584
um,

213
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,230
I know that they,

214
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,380
like most martial arts,

215
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:51,490
there's like a spiritual message.

216
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,430
Is there any like kind of spiritual
guidelines through Jujitsu?

217
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,850
Well,

218
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,530
there are in different schools,

219
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:56,741
you know,

220
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:59,500
depending on who's
teaching you and how they,

221
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,490
how they approach it.

222
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,600
But there's as overall
in the art of Jujitsu,

223
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,490
and I call it an art
because it really is an art.

224
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,380
It's like there's it's
techniques and it's,

225
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:09,280
it's a martial art.

226
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,413
It's the most,

227
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,890
most Marshall or the most art
of martial arts in my opinion,

228
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,610
and my opinion because it's
the most open to creativity.

229
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,150
Like guys like Eddie Bravo is the best
example of that because he's such a

230
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:22,901
creative guy.

231
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,820
He's invented so many moves,

232
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,480
so many transitions and pathways and
named them and they're really unique.

233
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:29,770
So if like your role with him,

234
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,990
he literally don't know what he's doing.

235
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,840
If you roll with the standard Jujitsu Guy,

236
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,790
even if you're really good,

237
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,060
like if there's like there's certain
guys like a Hicks and Gracie for example,

238
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,430
who does the basics,

239
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,140
all of the basics of Jujitsu,

240
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:49,141
but does them to a level of mastery that
you cannot comprehend until he trained

241
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,280
with him and you,

242
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,180
when you train with him,

243
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:52,721
you would just go,

244
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,430
all that other stuff is nonsense.

245
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,530
You just need straight Jujitsu,

246
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,990
you know,

247
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,190
from the mothership,

248
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,410
from Eylea Gracie and Carlos Gracie,

249
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,071
that's all you need.

250
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,210
Just razor sharp.

251
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,044
That shit.

252
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Hodra Gracie is like that hens,

253
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:05,901
those like that.

254
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:06,340
They,

255
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,340
they mostly just do the basics but to a
level of mastery that's incomprehensible

256
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,310
to the average person.

257
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,100
But then there's a bunch of
guys that are super creative.

258
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:17,210
Like Jeff Glover,

259
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,680
the guy that we were
talking about the other day,

260
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:19,341
he's one of them.

261
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:19,911
Bravo.

262
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:20,840
Eddie Bravo is one of them,

263
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:21,674
of course.

264
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,420
And there's a bunch of
other guys out there too.

265
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:23,810
Um,

266
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,680
Eddie Cummins,

267
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:27,380
who's a student of this guy.

268
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,040
Um,

269
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,840
John Danaher who's probably
the most creative of all the,

270
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,090
the teachers or one of the
most creative next to Eddie.

271
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,780
Um,

272
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,950
and he's like got this crazy leg lock
game that they're all learning so they're

273
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,710
all learning this like super complicated
leg lock came from this guy who was

274
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:44,780
like a philosophy phd major.

275
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,741
That's what he was doing.

276
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:50,360
He was like studying philosophy
and working as a bouncer
and he got into Jujitsu

277
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,970
because he wanted to learn how to defend
themselves cause all these fights would

278
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:53,990
happen when people are drunk.

279
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,750
And then he just became obsessed with
Jujitsu and now he's like one of the most

280
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,030
sought after Jiu Jitsu
coaches in the world.

281
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:00,170
Like George Saint Pierre,

282
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,650
you still use him and he teaches at
Henzel Gracie academy in New York.

283
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,290
So it's like there's like this
real underground like it's,

284
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,950
it's not what everybody thinks it is.

285
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,930
People think of it as being like meatheads
and like these like really muscled up

286
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:17,090
do's with tattoos on their necks.

287
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,020
It's not,

288
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,370
there's a lot of those guys in there too,

289
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,960
but what it really is,

290
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,990
is this crazy problem solving game that's
going on that everybody's playing with

291
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:27,074
their body.

292
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,850
It's going to sound like
a really silly question,

293
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:31,520
but if we give you,

294
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:32,000
if you,

295
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,950
if say Eddie Bravo,

296
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,950
say you picked a fight with Eddie Bravo
and he was forced to kick your ass.

297
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,680
Would there be at some point when you
woke up the next day that you'd remember

298
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:41,480
something he did to you
artistically and be like,

299
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,121
damn,

300
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:42,954
I was beautiful.

301
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:43,570
Well yeah,

302
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:43,921
we'll,

303
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,754
we spar.

304
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,600
If we would spar,

305
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,950
Eddie would do shit to me and I would go,

306
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:47,101
what?

307
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:47,550
What'd you do?

308
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,270
How'd you set that up?

309
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,103
What did I do wrong?

310
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,120
And like he's always teaching like he
doesn't hide anything from students.

311
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,550
Yeah.

312
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,500
He's always trying to get
them so that they tap him.

313
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:56,800
Like he gets tapped by students,

314
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,990
but he considers it a good thing.

315
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:01,150
It's like I taught this guy so
well that he can get me there.

316
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,480
That you need that if you don't have that,

317
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,230
it's like,

318
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,670
don't you agree that as standup
comedians we need to be around killers?

319
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:10,170
Like you need to be around Diaz.

320
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,060
He need to be around guys like Burt,

321
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,680
like when you're around all these killers,

322
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:14,880
it makes you up your game.

323
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,760
I told you that the day after
we were all at the comedy store,

324
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,870
uh,

325
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,610
and you had the joke about,

326
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,503
uh,

327
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,463
Bruce Jenner,

328
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,560
the gargoyle and I'm fucking
howling in the back and I,

329
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,370
and I'm,

330
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,630
I don't know if I told you this part,

331
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:28,620
but I will tell you right now,

332
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,630
and then I went up in between you,

333
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:31,464
amber.

334
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,860
Amber went up after me and to seamlessly
destroyed and then you went up into the

335
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,050
seamlessly destroyed after him and I got,

336
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:37,741
I woke up the next morning.

337
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:38,311
I totally Anna,

338
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,240
so I'm fucking bombed.

339
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,074
I'm not,

340
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,340
I'm not like,

341
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:42,780
I'm not writing the way
these guys were writing.

342
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:43,051
Like I'm,

343
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:43,884
I feel like I'm,

344
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,970
I'm slow.

345
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:45,570
I'm not,

346
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,130
I feel clumsy on stage.

347
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:47,964
I feel like,

348
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,630
I feel like I should.

349
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,900
I,

350
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,740
and then Leann was like,

351
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:50,100
hold on,

352
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,430
hold on.

353
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,780
You're talking about Joe and bill,

354
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,450
two of the best comedians in the world,

355
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,190
so don't hold to that standard,

356
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,090
but use that.

357
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,900
Use that inspiration by watching
the bests to say to yourself,

358
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:01,291
well fuck,

359
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,124
I can be better.

360
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,660
That's if that's what you're saying.

361
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,990
I always feel like that he always
got to feel like you could be better.

362
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:07,291
Right?

363
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,880
I mean I always do I those low level
cons who come out of a club and they're

364
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,020
like,

365
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,791
well just look that room.

366
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,451
I'll fucking fire.

367
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:12,781
And you're like,

368
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:15,450
I don't know what fight you saw but I saw
you get kind of fucking up against the

369
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:19,110
ropes like New York is
was when I was there.

370
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:20,040
It was filled with that.

371
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,370
Guys that walk out fucking destroyed
that shit in the beginning.

372
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:26,490
I think that's like a defense
mechanism that guys put on.

373
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,050
If you talk to most comics,

374
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:30,090
most comics are not happy with their act.

375
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,580
Do you think seriously
good people that are good?

376
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:34,840
Yeah.

377
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,330
It was always like these
moments where you're like,

378
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:36,641
God,

379
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:37,530
I gotta fix this.

380
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:38,490
I've got to tighten that up.

381
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:38,970
I got gotta.

382
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,000
It's the guys that are like
super confident about my act.

383
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,853
Perfect right now.

384
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,460
Your ex dog shit,

385
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,323
you know that's like,

386
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,623
it's just a,

387
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,420
there's a like a high level of scrutiny
that you have to give yourself and give

388
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:53,010
what you're doing and you know,

389
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,490
it does,

390
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,670
it's like this is a lot of
bits that just don't ever work.

391
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,030
They just know you got to
eventually get a thought,

392
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,270
throw them in the garbage,

393
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,380
they just don't like,

394
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:01,891
you're like,

395
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:02,371
God damn it.

396
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:05,550
There's something in here and you just
hammer at it and trying to turn into a

397
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:06,384
sword.

398
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,180
But nope,

399
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,310
it's just a ladle.

400
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,181
It's a ladle.

401
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:10,200
It's gonna stay a ladle.

402
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:11,250
It just never works.

403
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,270
It just stupid thing that you very rarely
use and it's just like might've worked

404
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:17,400
a couple of times on
stage in certain places,

405
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:20,070
but it's just can't
figure out the transition.

406
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,660
And then there's other bits that you like.

407
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:25,260
You Pilfer you take chunks of them and
you create other bits with them and it

408
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:28,590
turns out that there are better
mine than they are like an entity.

409
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,110
They're better for like mining ideas.

410
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,760
That's how that happens all the time.

411
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,070
We have a bit and you're into the bit,

412
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,160
but it turns out the,

413
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,670
the best part about it
is like a side thing,

414
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,900
you know,

415
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,960
like a little side path that you
take while you're creating it.

416
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,250
Yeah.

417
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,690
I like it more than I've ever liked.

418
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:47,400
It fed up more than ever.

419
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,720
It's so much fun man.

420
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,111
You know,

421
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:51,390
especially like right now because uh,

422
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,540
is a year after my last special and I
have like a full set now and now I'm just

423
00:10:57,001 --> 00:11:01,890
trying to make it good and trying
to add to it and cut away from it.

424
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,350
But it's like I am working with,

425
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:04,651
you know,

426
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:05,550
a full hour,

427
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:07,920
20 minutes of new stuff so it's all,

428
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,810
I pretty much have what I need
to turn into like a weapon now.

429
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,970
Now I have to like hone it and sharpen it.

430
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,620
It's super exciting man.

431
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,410
Cause it's nerve racking and you know,

432
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:23,130
and you're doing a lot of sets and you're
fucking around in different places and

433
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,950
it's just never been
more excited about it.

434
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,813
So much fun.

435
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,390
I'm the,

436
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,223
I'm the,

437
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,130
not the opposite of you,

438
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:29,964
but like I get,

439
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,290
I have a hard time.

440
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,070
I,

441
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,710
I like the fucking of creativity.

442
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,030
I like to fucking of impulse.

443
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:36,864
I don't like to,

444
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,850
I don't like to be in a
relationship with creativity.

445
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,391
She's like,

446
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,690
I don't,

447
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,523
I'm not,

448
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,191
I don't want to meet,

449
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:41,490
create,

450
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,380
I like the moment where you get an idea,

451
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:46,740
you meet it at the bar and you fucking
take it home and you fuck it up against a

452
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,600
wall and then you walk
out and you're like,

453
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:49,890
I'll never call that idea again.

454
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:50,821
I love that.

455
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:50,971
Like,

456
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:52,140
so you mean like in the moment,

457
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,640
like on a show on improvisation?

458
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:55,240
Is that what you mean?

459
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,451
Yeah.

460
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:57,130
I love when you come
up with an idea and I,

461
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:57,791
and I walk away.

462
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,240
I love that guy.

463
00:11:59,241 --> 00:11:59,741
Almost like,

464
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:00,290
I used to call,

465
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,910
used to call it the angel
share of like it wasn't a bit,

466
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,470
it was just happened or you or,

467
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,550
or what happens to me.

468
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:10,330
A lot of times I'll come up with a bit
and I'll kind of Ha I'll fuck it one

469
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:10,690
night.

470
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,360
I won't make a relationship out of it and
then I'll just use it and I'd be like,

471
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:13,691
okay,

472
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,130
I'm not going to,

473
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:14,951
I don't wanna fuck with that.

474
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm bored like I want to do,

475
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,790
I want the new next thing I'm a,

476
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,560
I'm a commitment phobe with material.

477
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:23,290
Like I run a tear through material
of so quickly that I just go like,

478
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,530
and maybe it's because it's not that good
or maybe it's because I'm not focusing

479
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:26,771
on it,

480
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:30,820
but I don't really have a lot of the
passion of focus on it and literally toil

481
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:31,654
with a bit.

482
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,760
Like I get really kind of
disconnected sometimes on stage,

483
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:35,861
like,

484
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:37,870
well I told him she's throwing
out and I'm a second car.

485
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,231
Second,

486
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:39,400
I say when I was 22 years old,

487
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:41,830
I fucking feel a weight on my shoulders.

488
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:42,011
Like,

489
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,341
fuck,

490
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:43,300
this is 12 minutes.

491
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,440
We were talking about this the other day.

492
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:46,210
Like you should just get that on a video,

493
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,380
get that and put it on Netflix thing or
something and then just release it so

494
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:51,400
you don't have to do it anymore.

495
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,770
Yeah,

496
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,470
I've were were negotiated in that.

497
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,180
I would put would you,

498
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:55,781
what are you talking about?

499
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:57,910
I brought up and if you do that man,

500
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,830
like then like maybe a year from now,

501
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:00,501
so going to last week,

502
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:02,380
tell him and I'll be inspired.

503
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,450
It'll still be fun.

504
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,111
But yeah,

505
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:05,891
you could tell a story.

506
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:07,510
Even a great story like that story,

507
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,110
you can tell it too many times and
just just call it goes away from you.

508
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,580
It doesn't mean anything and noises.

509
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,420
It's like,

510
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,721
you know,

511
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:16,480
like they would sell if you ever
say fuck around your grandma,

512
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,350
it's like Whoa,

513
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,270
it sounds so harsh.

514
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:19,670
You know,

515
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,800
like Oh my God,

516
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:21,310
you know?

517
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,960
But if you say fuck to us,

518
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,220
we say fuck around each other.

519
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,800
So often it's just like the or end or,

520
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:30,520
but it's just normal cause no
unusual registration of it,

521
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,383
you know?

522
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,280
I think that's the same thing with story.

523
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:35,550
If you tell a story so much that doesn't,

524
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:36,610
it doesn't register anymore.

525
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,230
Even though if you heard
it for the first time,

526
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:38,561
you'd be like,

527
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:38,890
why?

528
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,060
Like the first time
you told me that story,

529
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:40,340
I was like,

530
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,173
what?

531
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,610
What the fuck he doing?

532
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,630
No,

533
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,040
it's just,

534
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,741
it's filled with,

535
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,574
no,

536
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,350
it's a chaos filled story.

537
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:48,280
It's an awesome story.

538
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,114
So,

539
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,133
but if you,

540
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:50,471
you know,

541
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:51,700
you fucking too many times.

542
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:52,960
Yeah,

543
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,920
that's where I'm at right now.

544
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:54,780
Get bored.

545
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:54,910
Right?

546
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,080
It's a Chechen whore and a fucking 10
fucking miners are just running trains on

547
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:00,220
it to cigarette breath.

548
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:00,551
Come on,

549
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:04,060
you went to fuck when the month time
come on the machine and you're show me,

550
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,130
they'll show me you
have to change the oil.

551
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,960
There is a great moment though when you
tell that story and I have no passionate

552
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:11,380
about telling it but I
tell it and then this,

553
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,740
this like a couple that it just
doesn't seem like they'd ever liked me.

554
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:16,630
Just come out there like
that was fucking amazing.

555
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:17,380
And you're like,

556
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:17,980
you forget.

557
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,813
Exactly.

558
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,750
Daniel Thomas told me this.

559
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:20,260
He goes,

560
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,420
you have no idea how many
people don't know who you are.

561
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,620
Like concept of like you think
everyone's heard the story.

562
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,580
Everyone's heard the story.

563
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,760
I would say at least,

564
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,470
at least 80% of every room I
sell out or I sell or I sell,

565
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:35,891
you know,

566
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:37,480
in the club hasn't heard of me,

567
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,011
hasn't heard that story.

568
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,610
At least live you will.

569
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:44,050
You've got to think about how many people
there are to listen to nowadays too.

570
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,131
You know,

571
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:46,090
like for them to know,

572
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,740
even if they catch one of your podcasts,

573
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:49,210
like you've been on this pockets walk six,

574
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:49,831
seven times,

575
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:50,410
something like that.

576
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,450
If they catch one of them,

577
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,080
it might not

578
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,490
have them [inaudible] machine store in it.

579
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:53,731
Oh.

580
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:56,160
So they might think you're the best
and they don't even know that story.

581
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,080
I uh,

582
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,900
I've met a guy on a plane going to
Japan who's a fucking massive failure.

583
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:01,910
He had the shirt on and I,

584
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,850
this is how fucking
disconnected I am with life.

585
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,860
Sometimes I just like see the Jerry shirt.

586
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,733
I'm like,

587
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,890
I'll walk by him slow
and he'll be like June.

588
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,750
Like in my head I really
thought that that's ego,

589
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:12,141
whatever.

590
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:12,974
I'll be honest.

591
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,540
I make eye contact with the guy and
the guy who was high and I was like,

592
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,403
hey,

593
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,590
you look like a bear when the big gay bear

594
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,220
13 hour flight.

595
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,163
I'm like,

596
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:30,531
Hey.

597
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:31,364
He's like,

598
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,200
Hey,

599
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,033
and then I'll be like,

600
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,610
and then I did it like twice,

601
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:35,190
like I water.

602
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,840
I was like,

603
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,051
wait,

604
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:36,410
maybe I,

605
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,730
maybe I just got to do my laugh.

606
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:38,250
I don't know.

607
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,083
Like

608
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,890
in my head I'm like,

609
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,310
I'm like,

610
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,940
this is super drunk.

611
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,200
I'll fucking drunk Joe.

612
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,100
And so it makes you do my labs.

613
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,770
So then it finally I got a third walk by,

614
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:55,251
I'm like,

615
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:55,940
uh,

616
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,773
I'm like,

617
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,623
Amen.

618
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,431
Rogan experience.

619
00:15:58,431 --> 00:15:58,791
And he's like,

620
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,630
fuck yeah man.

621
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,081
And I was like,

622
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:00,800
Yo.

623
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,520
He was like,

624
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,353
you listen to it.

625
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,570
Yeah,

626
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,403
I have.

627
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,450
And in my head I was like,

628
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,171
I gotta be honest.

629
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:08,360
I have like fucking five
back loaded for this flight.

630
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:08,901
And I was like,

631
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:08,991
yeah,

632
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:09,801
which ones do you have loaded?

633
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,600
And I forget what we talked
about that she just said,

634
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:12,740
you should get Bert Kreischer.

635
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,850
He's amazing.

636
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,420
Do you know who Burt Christ's words?

637
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,910
You don't leave the machine.

638
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:17,541
It's the best story ever.

639
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,320
Did you gotta to turn it on it?

640
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,710
So,

641
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,010
uh,

642
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,030
and then I finally said to him,

643
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:20,361
I was like,

644
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:20,541
I've,

645
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:20,870
I've,

646
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,000
I've been on the podcast.

647
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:22,281
And he was like,

648
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:22,491
really?

649
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:22,791
Who are you?

650
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,031
I said,

651
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:23,341
Bert cry.

652
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:23,661
She was like,

653
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:23,811
oh,

654
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:24,350
cool.

655
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:24,561
He's like,

656
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:25,340
I don't get to everyone.

657
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,440
I'm really into the mixed martial artists.

658
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:27,891
I was like,

659
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:28,041
oh,

660
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:28,810
cool.

661
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,350
And so,

662
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,931
and then I was like,

663
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:30,081
well,

664
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:31,040
I'll tell you who you should listen to.

665
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:31,581
And then I was like,

666
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:34,720
have you listened to
Dunkin or Joey or Ari?

667
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,031
And he was like,

668
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:35,661
I've heard already.

669
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,560
I know Joey.

670
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,610
I don't know dunk.

671
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,421
Like he just was like,

672
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:42,740
he was a mixed martial artist fan and
he was ripped to what is dictates.

673
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:42,961
Likes.

674
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:43,490
Yeah.

675
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,323
Salty.

676
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
It was a flight to Japan.

677
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:47,090
I put with Sabi on it.

678
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,473
Ooh,

679
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,390
wow.

680
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,223
Someone's done that.

681
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:51,570
Oh,

682
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,070
I guarantee you,

683
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm sure it's coated in Wasabi.

684
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,570
It's definitely happened after listening.

685
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,620
Then humiliation.

686
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:58,620
Oh yeah.

687
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,453
Not Bizarre.

688
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,400
I fucking couldn't turn it off.

689
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:02,930
That was the shortest
podcasts where we did,

690
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,220
it was like an hour.

691
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,031
She's very nice.

692
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:05,864
It wasn't her fault.

693
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,580
Choosy humiliate tricks.

694
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:07,910
Yeah.

695
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,230
I know very well known.

696
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:12,590
One of those where she likes steps
on the guys balls with high heels.

697
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,761
Doesn't do that.

698
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,110
She doesn't do anything in person.

699
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,250
Oh she does it all over the Internet
and all over the phone and all over like

700
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:23,180
she sends them things and they like they
pay for a poop and her fingernails and

701
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:24,950
shit like dirty stinky,

702
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,720
stinky socks and stuff.

703
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,280
They pay for underwear.

704
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,770
[inaudible] underwear one.

705
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,600
Well there's all sorts of weird shit too.

706
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:37,601
Like they'll film themselves doing awful
things like getting fucked by guys and

707
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,560
they send it to her and then she holds
it and she threatens to blackmail them

708
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,470
and then they get suicidal
but they want this,

709
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,570
they request this like she
would never release it.

710
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,860
It's really interesting.

711
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:49,860
She's very smart

712
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,210
and she was a very nice person.

713
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,940
She like didn't seem like the
type of person that would do that.

714
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:55,020
She's very intelligent,

715
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:56,790
like you have a great
conversation with her.

716
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,511
Joe's a,

717
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,111
it was an interesting,

718
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:58,860
it was interesting.

719
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,030
The thing that she said
that was interesting to me
was an eye for hurt bird.

720
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,320
I was with a dominatrix for a day,

721
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,870
so I was like full blown
all with a dominatrix.

722
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,710
And what was really fascinating is they
said something about that first sexual

723
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:11,544
experience you have,

724
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,430
it sets an imprint for who
you're going to be sexually.

725
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah.

726
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,720
And I remember the first thing
I ever fucking saw was uh,

727
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,210
on Fletcher Avenue Ne,

728
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,000
this pizza shop is old news stand in.

729
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:25,860
My sister picked up a magazine that
was bondage and showed it to me and was

730
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:26,340
like,

731
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,290
like fucking full blown bondage.

732
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:28,801
And I was like,

733
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:29,280
what?

734
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,210
I was like maybe first grade.

735
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:30,541
I was like,

736
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,380
what the fuck?

737
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,320
When I went to this dominatrix in like 19,

738
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,350
no 2001 is when I went and did an episode.

739
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,850
She said,

740
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:39,983
uh,

741
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,010
she check out some of my stuff.

742
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:42,510
We're just bullshitting mistress Isabella.

743
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:43,890
Ari had her own as podcast too.

744
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:44,641
He's like,

745
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:47,250
you just turn it on someone and stuff and
gave me a bunch of videos and I put in

746
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,390
one and dude,

747
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,531
one thing,

748
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:54,390
just like fucking like the rubber gloves
up to the shoulders with the boost Da.

749
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,250
And I was literally,

750
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:58,440
it brought me back to that
point and I had this fucking,

751
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,600
it's like rediscovering like shit.

752
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,463
Like I was like,

753
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,090
holy fuck.

754
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,810
Really?

755
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,140
Oh,

756
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,840
so it imprinted in you
during that formative age.

757
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:09,700
So you've had an actual
experience with angel.

758
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,051
You again,

759
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:10,680
just please,

760
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:10,950
I'm gonna,

761
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,641
I'm gonna say six.

762
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:14,280
I'm going to have probably first grade
before first grade around first grade.

763
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:15,420
When was it that you saw it again?

764
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,040
28 years old.

765
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,821
Wow.

766
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:19,650
So 22 years later or something like

767
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,431
22 years later.

768
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:20,571
And I'm,

769
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:20,851
by the way,

770
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:22,110
I'd never been tied up.

771
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:23,820
I never tied up a girl I'd never been in,

772
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:24,840
but I'd never,

773
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,770
I'd never done any of that.

774
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:27,600
She had never been leather or like,

775
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
or like never been leather,

776
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,230
like been leathered up or their depth.

777
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,411
Yeah,

778
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:31,531
no,

779
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:31,861
you know,

780
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:32,990
like I never been any,

781
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,380
I'm like a meat and potatoes fucker.

782
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,090
Like I go in,

783
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,080
I have sex,

784
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,040
maybe a couple of positions,

785
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:38,874
but that's it.

786
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,163
And uh,

787
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,000
and then I saw this and I was like,

788
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,350
it fucking hit a switch.

789
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:43,801
And I was like,

790
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:44,940
what the fuck?

791
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,043
But you liked it.

792
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,681
I liked it.

793
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:47,514
I thought it was hot.

794
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,830
Like you've ever looked
at like little Mrs. Yeah,

795
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,010
she knows I had Mr Mistresses,

796
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:53,844
Isabel at my house.

797
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,510
I wish my wife would get into that.

798
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,830
Not Interested in the whole lesson.

799
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,581
Taste with kids,

800
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:03,690
do not want to get tied up.

801
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,920
That's just a fact.

802
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,960
Fucking and not at all.

803
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,223
What happened?

804
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,510
They used to love that
shit because now they're,

805
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,271
they're a mom.

806
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:14,530
There's something that happens.

807
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:15,400
It switches.

808
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,650
It's very hard to describe.

809
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,670
Um,

810
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:23,140
I think you know a little bit of it
because you're a dad and when you become a

811
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:23,710
dad,

812
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,000
you switch from just being
a guide with dad and it's,

813
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,180
it's a very real switch,

814
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,540
but I don't think it's nearly as gigantic
as the switch that goes off inside of

815
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:37,930
a woman when she actually grows the baby
in her body and then gives birth to it

816
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:40,570
and then is insanely
responsible for that baby.

817
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:43,400
And they loved them to
a level that like you,

818
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,450
you compare the way you love your
kids to the way someone says,

819
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:46,811
Oh my God,

820
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:47,590
I love cat.

821
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,861
You like,

822
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,990
you don't even know what the fuck love is.

823
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,610
You think a cat is like,

824
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,780
I can love a cat openly and pure porch.

825
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,290
Shut the fuck up.

826
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,303
Shut up.

827
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,143
Shut up.

828
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,040
If you had a kid it would be different.

829
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:00,280
Yeah,

830
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,510
there's,

831
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,870
there's an intense,

832
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,830
and I don't even necessarily say that
this is like a moral choice that you make

833
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,664
that it's different.

834
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,820
I think there's some insane biological
switches that go off that are undeniable.

835
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,461
You know,

836
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:17,461
there's this connection between oxytocin
and kids and that you look at the kids

837
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:18,641
and you,

838
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,440
your brain produces oxytocin,

839
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,180
which is just love feeling.

840
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,340
There's like all sorts of
weird shit that goes on.

841
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,760
I think that for a
woman and not all women,

842
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:30,520
because there's women
that have that do porn,

843
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,750
that have babies,

844
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,490
they have families and they have,

845
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:33,820
they,

846
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,121
you know,

847
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:39,121
they've given birth and then they go and
just get gang bang by giant dicks and

848
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:40,120
they love it.

849
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,840
They love it.

850
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,650
You think they love it?

851
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,310
I don't know.

852
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,300
They say they love it.

853
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,360
I have no reason to believe they're
lying and I don't want to ruin it.

854
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,863
I don't know.

855
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,070
They say they love it.

856
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,380
I think there's a lot of
different people in the world,

857
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:53,561
man.

858
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:54,970
Think about a guy like you and some,

859
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,740
some guy who's like
really into accounting.

860
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,730
You know there's gotta be someone out
there that enjoy is doing people's books.

861
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,360
There's gotta be some noise and try it.

862
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,150
There's gotta be someone
out there that does that.

863
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:08,230
That's a real person.

864
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,430
So if this is a real person,

865
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:14,431
I think of course he's a real person wants
to pay for Sierra Lynch's shit or you

866
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:14,861
know,

867
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:19,450
some real person who can do stand up
comedy like so people are fucking weird.

868
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:20,770
We vary so much.

869
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,900
We vary so much.

870
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,700
I mean that's why there's
so many different types of
music and so many different

871
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:32,080
types of movies and just human
beings are fucking very strange.

872
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:37,530
But one big thing that does happen with
a lot of them is that they have kids and

873
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:38,350
they change.

874
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,250
Fucking really changed.

875
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,940
Like I would fucking night and day,

876
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,330
I don't even know the guy was before
trying to get lap dances and like undo my

877
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,600
zipper with your butt cheeks.

878
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:48,310
That kinda guy.

879
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,620
Right.

880
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't even fucking
know that guy anymore.

881
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,103
I know that guy.

882
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,310
We've been drunk with that guy.

883
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,400
Produce.

884
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,620
He'd do them next time we get drunk.

885
00:22:58,621 --> 00:22:59,454
We good.

886
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,260
Hey Bert,

887
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,330
this is your other Bert.

888
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,510
This is the original Bert.

889
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,393
He's still here.

890
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,420
He's just a dormant like some alien virus.

891
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,010
I always think if someone videotaped
me jerking off it will go.

892
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:13,381
But like,

893
00:23:13,381 --> 00:23:13,561
you know,

894
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:14,610
like those,

895
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:14,910
uh,

896
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,740
the I things and the Max,

897
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:17,731
I was like,

898
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:20,770
someone's gotta be able to get in there
already have made sure that you have,

899
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,840
and if they've done that,

900
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,670
I'm just putting out the
numbers of the honeypot.

901
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,710
I gotta be met folded in there somewhere.

902
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,020
You just have to go all in.

903
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,400
I've found and let get her dad
and notice my light was on.

904
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:32,820
And then I was like frantically looking
through all my programs to see which one

905
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:33,870
was using my webcam.

906
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,070
None of them were.

907
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,671
And now I'm like,

908
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:35,941
all right.

909
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:36,361
You know what,

910
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:37,620
how long has this been going on?

911
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,480
I've just straight been masturbating for,

912
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:40,200
Geez,

913
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,280
even for like a long time.

914
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:44,810
You just have to accept it that
they've seen you come many times.

915
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,070
It's probably fun

916
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,610
for them.

917
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,840
Imagine be able to hack into your laptop
and watch the machine shirk off criss

918
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:52,320
cross apple sauce on a bed

919
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,230
thinking with the toes.

920
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,750
No pausing in between jerkiness
off your toes every fucking time.

921
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:00,940
Like I'm not sure if I want to know this.

922
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,853
I'll tell Ya.

923
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,820
Criss Cross applesauce on a mattress.

924
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:05,541
That's how you do it.

925
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:05,870
Yeah.

926
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,130
You always sit criss criss cross apple.

927
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,970
Yo,

928
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,070
you ever hear her bosses joke
about sitting Indian style?

929
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,963
No.

930
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,350
When I was in first grade,

931
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:16,820
the teacher told me and sit Indian style.

932
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:21,821
So I got drunk and laid the curb fucking
loverage balls for the uninitiated.

933
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:26,210
What exactly is criss cross
applesauce sitting with your legs?

934
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:27,540
Cause sitting Indian style.

935
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:28,680
It was what we call it as kids.

936
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,440
And so then uh,

937
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,150
and then uh,

938
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,040
why don't you remember that?

939
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,140
What do you mean by do I remember that?

940
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,891
Because he has kids.

941
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:37,550
Apple sauce.

942
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,390
Oh cause I have kids.

943
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:39,224
You can't say,

944
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,610
can't say like Indian style.

945
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:40,881
Well yeah,

946
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:42,110
he can say said it didn't trouble.

947
00:24:42,111 --> 00:24:42,550
Now,

948
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,520
you can't say gypped.

949
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,700
You can't say like chipped is Gypsies.

950
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:46,840
Yeah.

951
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,110
And they're fucking rain in La.

952
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:48,860
They are.

953
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,491
Oh God,

954
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:50,150
yeah man.

955
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:50,870
Caravans.

956
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,990
Fucking know they're,

957
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,960
they're like these Russian gypsies like
lower these Ukrainian gypsies live in

958
00:24:56,961 --> 00:25:00,800
there and you cannot get them to
fucking obey traffic laws at all.

959
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:01,670
Yeah.

960
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:01,970
Yeah.

961
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,100
Do I do like a safety
valve for our school?

962
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,720
They'll come rolling in just in just
food and just don't give a fuck about

963
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:09,380
anyone and you,

964
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,430
you can't tell them anything.

965
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,080
They just start fucking yell at you
and literally don't give up the side.

966
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:14,923
Your daughter's school.

967
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,760
Both of my daughters school,

968
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:18,950
I ran into a black security guard.

969
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:22,790
I wanted to go to be black because he
fucking was and so and so because he

970
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:24,530
wouldn't say I ran into
a white security guard.

971
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:24,771
Yeah,

972
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:25,190
I wouldn't,

973
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,750
I just say I ran into a security guard.

974
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,583
He was Mexican.

975
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,310
I rarely say Mexican cause cause
I'm about to do his accent.

976
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:32,144
So I would,

977
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,770
I'd definitely be like,

978
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,120
so he just goes,

979
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,051
man,

980
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:37,760
these motherfuckers don't listen to shit.

981
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,590
I ain't racist or nothing but fuck,

982
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,090
fuck these watching all the blockers.

983
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,150
And I was like,

984
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:42,420
really?

985
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,110
I was like I but I get it man.

986
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,730
We come from much harsher,

987
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,690
harsher place.

988
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,050
A place where you had to fight for fucking
toilet paper and then you come here

989
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:52,820
and you're like soft.

990
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,380
Oh everyone's soft.

991
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,620
Soft little holes in our top of our heads.

992
00:25:56,621 --> 00:26:00,830
Still babies and the rest is just
fucking just fuck these red lights.

993
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,323
Red Lights.

994
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:03,920
Yeah.

995
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,550
The word Gyp is a weird one because I
never even knew what that mean Matt until

996
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:09,380
I realized like Oh like a decade ago.

997
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,220
Oh yeah.

998
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,300
Gypsy.

999
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,130
Oh you know the end got lit up for
saying one cotton picking minute.

1000
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,350
Wait one wait one cotton picking minute.

1001
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,040
What?

1002
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,540
Right.

1003
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:19,900
Yup.

1004
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,210
Cause I just pick cotton.

1005
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,040
No hold on.

1006
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,670
Who,

1007
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,390
who did this?

1008
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,200
Just a mom.

1009
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,033
Mom.

1010
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,110
Overly politically correct mam.

1011
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,910
Just excuse me.

1012
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,110
I'd appreciate if you didn't
use that kind of language lambs.

1013
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,110
Like wait hold on.

1014
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,290
We were talking about cause like there's
things where we said when kids like you

1015
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:39,410
call people ninnies well I think that
what's [inaudible] and then he is a,

1016
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:41,360
I think it's a derivative of picking any,

1017
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,220
which is a derivative of a young black kid

1018
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,053
from islands.

1019
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:45,571
So,

1020
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:48,000
but we got called ninnies all
growing up and I still send any,

1021
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,230
I didn't know that one.

1022
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,410
And so Leanne was like calm pig a minute
and they're like cotton picking minute.

1023
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,770
It has to do something with
black people and Lance like,

1024
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,711
and by the way,

1025
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:57,810
lance was saying that
her whole life and never,

1026
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,100
and she and my wife's a redneck,

1027
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,440
but it never heard that phrase.

1028
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,720
And like her new,

1029
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:05,760
the definition just
knew that was a phrase.

1030
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,780
So we looked it up.

1031
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,240
It turns out a cotton picking
minute has nothing to do with race.

1032
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,890
It has to do with the fact that cotton
is the most tedious crop to pick in the

1033
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:14,191
world.

1034
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:15,840
So if you picked cotton for one minute,

1035
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,100
it would feel like a year.

1036
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,210
So yes.

1037
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:18,541
When you say,

1038
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:18,751
wait,

1039
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:19,650
what cotton picking minute.

1040
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,480
It says wait a little
longer than a minute.

1041
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,201
Wait one,

1042
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:23,640
wait a long fucking minute.

1043
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:24,781
And so,

1044
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:25,890
but the menu I,

1045
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,890
everyone's so quick to be
up and fucking outraged.

1046
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,240
Well they just looking for an
opportunity to be outreach.

1047
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,010
I can't imagine that she was actually
upset at someone saying one cotton picking

1048
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:35,360
minute.

1049
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,850
Yeah.

1050
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,120
Oh,

1051
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,953
I can't imagine that.

1052
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,183
That's dumb.

1053
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,840
It's not just dumb.

1054
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,290
It's,

1055
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:44,340
it's a sign of the times we live in this
time where there's a bunch of people

1056
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:45,980
out there that think they're doing good,

1057
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:49,920
that they're good people because the
call people out and they shame people.

1058
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,160
You know,

1059
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,630
it's,

1060
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,890
it's so arbitrary.

1061
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:55,170
What you decide is negative
and what other people,

1062
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,340
it's all about intent.

1063
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,120
Right.

1064
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,840
And when you say one cotton
picking minute or hold off,

1065
00:27:59,841 --> 00:28:01,980
fuck his thinking about racism.

1066
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,630
Who's thinking a racist thought?

1067
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:04,464
When you say that,

1068
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,070
it's just a nice way saying one
motherfucking minute is what it is.

1069
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:08,590
Yeah.

1070
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:08,770
Yeah.

1071
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,780
That check was the racist for even putting
the two together with that kind of,

1072
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,050
she's just a dummy.

1073
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,910
There's a lot of them out there.

1074
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,010
There's a lot of
politically correct dummies.

1075
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,090
Like here's,

1076
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,850
here's one that's super common
that everybody wants to use.

1077
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:25,070
You know the term faggot is a
terrible term to use for gay folk ea.

1078
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,413
It's okay though.

1079
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,921
This terrible term,

1080
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:29,370
right?

1081
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,870
I'm going to have to say that that has,

1082
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,180
that has backfired because
that word is now age,

1083
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:34,050
like a fine wine.

1084
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:34,621
So beautiful.

1085
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:37,470
We were throwing around way too much
as kids and now you only hear it all

1086
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:41,670
special occasions and so
you're just saying that caught
me so fucking old guard.

1087
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:42,210
I was like,

1088
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:42,571
fuck man.

1089
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:43,090
I'm in hindsight,

1090
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,660
the machine story and
I'm making a comeback,

1091
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,850
but two to call someone that for
being gay is a terrible thing to do,

1092
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:51,180
right?

1093
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,230
It is a slur.

1094
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,160
It's a terrible thing to do.

1095
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:58,490
But to call someone that for being just
a pussy is what we always did as kids.

1096
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,251
Well,

1097
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:01,860
we can't do that anymore
because it's so problematic.

1098
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:03,780
It's too connected with that other word.

1099
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,870
But one of the things that
drives me crazy is when they,

1100
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:07,440
you know,

1101
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,210
what does the ed to Ma Entomology,

1102
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:09,631
what's the word?

1103
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:10,320
Etymology.

1104
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:10,831
Etymology.

1105
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:11,340
Right.

1106
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:11,651
When the,

1107
00:29:11,651 --> 00:29:11,850
the,

1108
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,070
the history of the origins of the word,

1109
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,430
they always like to say that it's about
a bundle of wood because these to light

1110
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,000
gay people on fire,

1111
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,770
that was on Louis show,

1112
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,810
he repeated this false myth.

1113
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,430
That's not what it meant.

1114
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,150
A bundle of wood meant you were,

1115
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:31,380
when they called you,

1116
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:31,861
it was all,

1117
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:32,940
it was like a burden.

1118
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:33,870
Some woman,

1119
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,460
that's the way they described it,

1120
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,130
like a bundle of woods,

1121
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,250
like something you got to carry.

1122
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:41,130
That was a really awkward
and a pain the ass.

1123
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,130
So that

1124
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,480
was a faggot of wood.

1125
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,610
So when you were acting like of
like a pain in the ass woman,

1126
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,650
like you would be a Faggot,

1127
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,390
you'd be a bundle of wood.

1128
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,370
That's such a pain to carry around.

1129
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:56,650
You'd be awkward and annoying.

1130
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,630
That's the origins of the word.

1131
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,400
So how did it get connected to gay people?

1132
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,640
It sounds great that it was because
these to light people on fire.

1133
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,181
Oh my God,

1134
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:05,014
you're a victim.

1135
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,003
Yes,

1136
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,461
I am.

1137
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:07,930
So don't use that word again.

1138
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,880
So full people tied and sure people
have definitely died from being gay,

1139
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,040
but that's not the origins of that word.

1140
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,660
That's not like the used to be angry.

1141
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,840
It's not like the whole world
was lightened gay people
on fire one point like it

1142
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:22,600
was a sport so much that it became a name.

1143
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,620
You connected them,

1144
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:24,610
which is called gay people.

1145
00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:25,480
Kerosene.

1146
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,201
No,

1147
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,040
that's not true.

1148
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:27,970
That's not what it was.

1149
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,950
It was a bundle of wood
was also like a burden.

1150
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:32,770
Some woman,

1151
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,420
that's the way they used to describe it.

1152
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:34,931
You can like,

1153
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:36,640
you can look up the origins of the word.

1154
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,680
That makes me feel so much more
sense for using it as kids.

1155
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:39,860
When you called your friend a bundle,

1156
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,290
a burdensome burdens and woman.

1157
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:41,621
Yeah.

1158
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:42,910
He called him taking forever.

1159
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:43,570
You faggot.

1160
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,410
Exactly.

1161
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:44,841
Yeah.

1162
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:45,970
Or You could stop crying,

1163
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:46,520
faggot.

1164
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,260
Like that's,

1165
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,170
that's has nothing to
do with homosexuality.

1166
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,130
The,

1167
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:56,130
the homosexuality aspect of it was calling
someone that if they're gay as a slur

1168
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,160
because if you think of
like the stereotypical gay
man like that gets mocked,

1169
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:03,640
it's like,

1170
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,660
oh my God,

1171
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,910
you know that like really
femme and feminine,

1172
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,370
which would be like a burdensome woman,

1173
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,850
so that's why they would call
those gay guys that slur.

1174
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,470
Holy Shit Man.

1175
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,231
West Hollywood.

1176
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:16,630
It's like a faggot of gaze,

1177
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,973
right?

1178
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,660
A bundle of gays.

1179
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,793
Yes.

1180
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,340
If you want to use it for the original
word that we can start dropping that in

1181
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,240
any grouping out,

1182
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:26,790
things will take a of carrots.

1183
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,720
It became a cigarette.

1184
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:29,590
I'm not butchering that.

1185
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:29,860
Right.

1186
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,521
Go look that up.

1187
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,570
Make sure I'm not butchering that.

1188
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,240
The 99% sure I'm not,

1189
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:38,440
but there's also some of they're a fag
became a cigarette and that was a big one

1190
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:39,250
in England.

1191
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:39,851
Like in England,

1192
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:43,120
they still say that can I call up a fag
and they do that to each other and it

1193
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:43,954
has no,

1194
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,510
no context is nothing gay about it at all.

1195
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,760
It's like their word for that.

1196
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:49,481
It's just,

1197
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:49,990
you know,

1198
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,531
it's different.

1199
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:52,750
Like fanny for them is a vagina.

1200
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,220
So if you have a fanny pack,

1201
00:31:54,221 --> 00:31:55,240
I wear a fanny pack.

1202
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:56,500
They mock me hardcore.

1203
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:56,740
You,

1204
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,030
you have a vagina pack.

1205
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,620
I know what you're saying.

1206
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,300
You have a vagina pack.

1207
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,531
That's amazing that they say,

1208
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:03,550
do you know what you're saying?

1209
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,180
Yeah.

1210
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,811
They clearly,

1211
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:05,320
any pack.

1212
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,010
Yeah,

1213
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,191
no,

1214
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:06,401
no,

1215
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:06,611
no.

1216
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:07,990
It's bumbag has,

1217
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,490
so they call him over there.

1218
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,810
They call them bum bags.

1219
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,950
But what is the real problem with all
this stuff is these forbidden words,

1220
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,771
taboo words.

1221
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,480
His words not aren't what's important.

1222
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,343
It's intent.

1223
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,130
And if you go around policing the world
and stopping words from being used,

1224
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,080
you don't change the People's intent.

1225
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,030
You don't do anything but be annoying.

1226
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,043
That's all you're doing.

1227
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,610
You're being an annoying person.

1228
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:33,070
Who is the voice of moral outrage?

1229
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,053
Excuse me.

1230
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,900
I would appreciate it if you didn't say
cotton picking mirror because you know

1231
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:38,800
that black people

1232
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,630
you white privilege to us.

1233
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,910
How you see the black people pay car.

1234
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,060
Do you know?

1235
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,920
You're saying,

1236
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,240
do you know what you're saying?

1237
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,310
Who fucking racist?

1238
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,600
Oh my God,

1239
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:51,321
you're a racist.

1240
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:52,011
I'm going to shame you.

1241
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:55,640
I'm going to blog and they run home to
their Tumblr account and blog about your

1242
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,770
wife and lie about it.

1243
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,460
Oh yeah.

1244
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,130
Exaggerate.

1245
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,070
Everybody's a fucking victim today.

1246
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,550
It's just exaggerate to
such an extreme extent.

1247
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:05,510
It's like,

1248
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,800
it's so tiresome.

1249
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,300
It's like stop.

1250
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,820
And the reason why they do it
is because he gets attention.

1251
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,083
It gets attention.

1252
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,920
That will a woman now your
wife had to talk to that woman.

1253
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:16,880
What?

1254
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,170
And your wife had to defend herself.

1255
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:18,351
What?

1256
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:20,570
Me Ha racist.

1257
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,211
And then women's.

1258
00:33:21,211 --> 00:33:22,044
I can,

1259
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,133
oh,

1260
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,360
my wife's one of those people,

1261
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:26,790
like I think of the rate
of Formula One in Britain.

1262
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,720
Which one?

1263
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,180
There's a guy who were informing the one
in Britain that got caught in this like

1264
00:33:30,181 --> 00:33:31,380
sex scheme.

1265
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,340
The sex thing.

1266
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,150
Your wife's a pimp?

1267
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,370
No,

1268
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:33,510
no,

1269
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:33,611
no,

1270
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:33,751
no,

1271
00:33:33,751 --> 00:33:34,080
no.

1272
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,441
It's a,

1273
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:35,430
I read a book on shame,

1274
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:36,270
on public shaming,

1275
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,990
and there's all these examples and there's
just one guy whose dad was a famous

1276
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,490
Nazi,

1277
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,880
like a Nazi sympathizer.

1278
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,240
And then he got caught in these s and
m things where it looked like he was a

1279
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:47,340
Nazi and it was like the people,

1280
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:48,210
we're going to fucking slam him.

1281
00:33:48,211 --> 00:33:49,230
And it said in the book,

1282
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,110
the only way to get through public
shaming is to not give a fuck about the

1283
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:52,800
shaming.

1284
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,220
Like if you're,

1285
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,670
if you don't,

1286
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,240
if you're like,

1287
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,601
you can't,

1288
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:54,961
shame me,

1289
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:56,040
cause I don't give a fuck

1290
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,750
funny with this Charlie Sheen story,

1291
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,290
because that's how Charlie Sheen
got through everything up until now,

1292
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,680
not giving a fuck up until suck in a deck.

1293
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,431
And then it's like,

1294
00:34:06,431 --> 00:34:07,420
hey,

1295
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,070
hey,

1296
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,581
hey,

1297
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:09,851
whoa,

1298
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:10,960
whoa,

1299
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,453
whoa.

1300
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,983
I'll give you money.

1301
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,700
So we did some dude's
Dick allegedly video.

1302
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,410
You're getting everything.

1303
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:20,801
Third,

1304
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:21,611
fourth hand.

1305
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:23,170
Who the fuck knows what really happened?

1306
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,180
Allegedly?

1307
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:26,140
There's a video.

1308
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,003
I don't know.

1309
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:27,671
I don't know.

1310
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:28,504
I haven't seen it.

1311
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,380
But the point being,

1312
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:33,580
he said he always owned up to
everything he did up until this,

1313
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,710
everything he did up until this was like,

1314
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:37,030
who gives a fuck all?

1315
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:38,290
Well that's me.

1316
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,120
Tiger blood winning,

1317
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,163
you know,

1318
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,243
quote unquote.

1319
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,233
Now,

1320
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,470
now you know,

1321
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,670
I mean he went on Matt Lauer's that
what it was and said that he had HIV,

1322
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,811
but you know what?

1323
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:51,520
HIV is a weird one dude,

1324
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,000
because medication that they
have today is so effective.

1325
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:59,620
You take HIV medication and it
doesn't even show up in your blood.

1326
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,150
I'd rather have that than Hep c.

1327
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:01,751
Oh my God,

1328
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:02,620
there's so many dish.

1329
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,630
It's got this stigma attached to it.

1330
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:05,230
Right.

1331
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,180
But there's so many diseases that kill
people that are quicker than that.

1332
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:11,350
Like women die from HPV,

1333
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,300
which is like super common,

1334
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,070
but we want to pop Loma virus.

1335
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:15,581
Yeah.

1336
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:17,050
Women get cancer from that.

1337
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:19,480
They can get cancer from that
and they can die from that.

1338
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:24,690
That's way more common than a guy with
HIV in the western world who finds out

1339
00:35:25,901 --> 00:35:26,171
about it,

1340
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:30,550
gets diagnosed and started
taking medication way more
common for a woman to die

1341
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:35,551
from that than it is for the guy to die
from the HIV in 2015 2015 is an amazing

1342
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:37,590
time to have HIV.

1343
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:38,911
You want to go get it?

1344
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:39,630
Go get it.

1345
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:39,990
Go get it.

1346
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,411
You want it.

1347
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:41,420
It's like they've,

1348
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,720
they don't have it licked.

1349
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:43,920
And the point where they work,

1350
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,430
where they have an injection that
they can give you the cures it,

1351
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,310
but they do have medication
that make it undetectable.

1352
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,350
The him not telling the girls though.

1353
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:53,550
Do you think that's a,

1354
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:53,761
I mean,

1355
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:54,660
that's pretty fucked up,

1356
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:55,080
right?

1357
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,680
That's,

1358
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,000
that's prison time.

1359
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:57,810
Um,

1360
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,550
it's definitely not nice.

1361
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,813
Definitely.

1362
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,720
I just feel like,

1363
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,020
I mean,

1364
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,100
I had to do the triangle,

1365
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:05,360
like,

1366
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:05,731
oh shit.

1367
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:08,730
Did I sleep with somebody that slept
with somebody that might have slept with

1368
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:09,031
him?

1369
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:09,271
You know,

1370
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:09,810
I it,

1371
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,550
I don't think you can get it that way.

1372
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,560
There's very little evidence that a man
can get it through normal heterosexual

1373
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:17,250
intercourse,

1374
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,570
herpes outbreak and or period.

1375
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:19,711
By the way,

1376
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,460
I've been saying this for fucking years.

1377
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,190
It's not politically correct to say,

1378
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,810
but there's very little evidence.

1379
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,763
Here's the deal.

1380
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,551
If you could,

1381
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:27,720
if it was easy to get.

1382
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,230
I'm not saying it's impossible to get
because I'm obviously not a doctor and an

1383
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,064
idiot,

1384
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,990
but I think if it was,

1385
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,930
if it was possible or
easy to get Jesus Christ,

1386
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:37,890
everybody would have it.

1387
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:38,850
Jeremy would it?

1388
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:39,001
Well,

1389
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:41,850
that's what everybody was
worried about in the 1990s when,

1390
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:45,020
when AIDS started the it's
rampant rage through the,

1391
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:46,080
the public eye.

1392
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,030
Everybody was scared that
everybody was going to have it.

1393
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,660
I had my first AIDS test
and 92 it was an HIV test,

1394
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:52,260
I guess.

1395
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:52,500
Uh,

1396
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,130
I was getting a insurance and
I had to get it an aids test.

1397
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,571
I was like,

1398
00:36:56,571 --> 00:36:57,420
oh my God.

1399
00:36:57,421 --> 00:36:59,220
It was fucking terrified.

1400
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,300
Terrified,

1401
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,500
terrified.

1402
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,060
And when it came back clean,

1403
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:03,421
I was like,

1404
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,254
yes,

1405
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,160
because you don't know.

1406
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,770
I think all the time she got
drunk and didn't use a condom.

1407
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,420
And who knows what that
girl had and who knows what.

1408
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,310
It's just like there's no,

1409
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,821
if,

1410
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:12,090
if,

1411
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:16,440
if it really was something that normal
heterosexual men got through normal

1412
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:17,274
intercourse.

1413
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,250
The way it's been described to
me by medical professionals,

1414
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,250
obviously not by knuckleheads
on the Internet was it,

1415
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:28,251
it's just really difficult to get that
because a man is injecting his dick

1416
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:30,570
inside of a girl and coming and a girl,

1417
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:35,790
a woman's vagina on the other hand is
an excellent candidate for reception

1418
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,900
because it's moist in there.

1419
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,050
It's essentially open tissue.

1420
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,621
You know,

1421
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:40,941
you,

1422
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:41,774
you can,

1423
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,780
it's like,

1424
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,810
that's why like some
girls take drugs that way.

1425
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,820
That's why people take
drugs ain't only too,

1426
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,680
while you take like an anal suppository,

1427
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:53,070
like dudes to take ecstasy Annaly that
take an ecstasy pill and stuff it up

1428
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,690
their ass and it'll melt down,

1429
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,280
break down and get into their bloodstream.

1430
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,563
Yeah.

1431
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,910
People to a herpes,

1432
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,410
a little drunk tea and tea drinking chill.

1433
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:04,710
You can kill you cause it goes
through right into your blood.

1434
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:05,401
Yeah.

1435
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:06,870
That's real dangerous man.

1436
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:08,160
Because it's not going
through your stomach.

1437
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,430
You can get fucked up
from putting like alcohol,

1438
00:38:11,431 --> 00:38:12,001
like vodka,

1439
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:14,410
vodka up your asshole tampons.

1440
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:14,660
Right.

1441
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,191
And Vodka,

1442
00:38:15,191 --> 00:38:16,024
tampons,

1443
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:16,351
girls,

1444
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:16,650
soap,

1445
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,590
tampons in vodka and stuff from
their pussy or they go to the club,

1446
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,320
but they have fresh,

1447
00:38:22,321 --> 00:38:23,154
minty breath.

1448
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,220
There's breath is perfect.

1449
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,100
Go back to this,

1450
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,100
go back to this age thing.

1451
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,040
I had some people one
night and I was drunk.

1452
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:31,890
I was in Atlanta by some
people from the CDC at my show.

1453
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,440
And they were saying exactly
what you're saying to me.

1454
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:34,770
Yeah.

1455
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,430
Because said something about,

1456
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,441
I don't know,

1457
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:38,141
I forget the Gee,

1458
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:38,351
I may,

1459
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:39,220
I'm sure I made a joke.

1460
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:40,600
And they came out and
they like set me straight.

1461
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:40,871
They're like,

1462
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:41,440
listen,

1463
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,250
it's very,

1464
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,083
oh my first,

1465
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,600
the,

1466
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,231
this is nominal.

1467
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:45,041
It's not worth telling.

1468
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:45,874
But one of the,

1469
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,380
I got an aids test at 95.

1470
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,453
And uh,

1471
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,120
one of the first jokes I ever
wrote ever before I was a comedian.

1472
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,310
And I remember waiting
the results and saying,

1473
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,173
think positive.

1474
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,311
No,

1475
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:55,440
no,

1476
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,273
think negative,

1477
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:56,711
negative,

1478
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:58,770
nothing positive or negative like I was.

1479
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,410
And I was like,

1480
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,580
am I was waiting in the waiting room.

1481
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:01,250
And I thought,

1482
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,083
that's funny.

1483
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,850
Like you want a positive result,

1484
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:04,601
but you would have negative,

1485
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:05,620
positive result.

1486
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:06,790
And I was joking with my head,

1487
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,481
I said that.

1488
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:08,350
Then they came out and they said,

1489
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:08,621
no,

1490
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:10,180
you exactly what you just said.

1491
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,240
Yeah.

1492
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,770
It's very hard to get apparently,

1493
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,633
and this is just,

1494
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,140
this seems to be a consensus.

1495
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,290
I wouldn't say something like this
to try to encourage people to not use

1496
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:19,124
condoms,

1497
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,520
but it just seems like through
now gay sacks and the other hand,

1498
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,810
if you were having gay,

1499
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:24,531
anal sex,

1500
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:27,740
the same thing you're dealing
with like open tissue.

1501
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,660
It's not skin.

1502
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,860
It's not the same.

1503
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:31,371
You know,

1504
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:32,690
it's not the same as the skin on the out.

1505
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,860
If you come on someone's back,

1506
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:35,120
I'm pretty sure they're
not going to get aids,

1507
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,010
but if you come in there butthole

1508
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,710
and you've got the hip,

1509
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,600
weird things can happen.

1510
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,111
It's getting,

1511
00:39:42,111 --> 00:39:42,830
it's getting bad.

1512
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,110
I think there's a lot of
scary diseases out there,

1513
00:39:45,111 --> 00:39:45,710
man.

1514
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,191
I think,

1515
00:39:46,191 --> 00:39:46,550
uh,

1516
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,120
we were super lucky that we live in
live in this amazing time as far as like

1517
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,220
modern medicine and what
they could figure out.

1518
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,063
Not figure out,

1519
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,160
but it's always going to be weirdest when
diseases come through sex because like

1520
00:39:58,161 --> 00:40:02,990
Ebola is scary as fuck and malaria
is the scariest of all time.

1521
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:04,700
Malaria has killed ready for this.

1522
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:09,200
There's a fact malaria has killed half
of the people that have ever died,

1523
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:10,034
ever.

1524
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,120
What?

1525
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,780
Yup.

1526
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,550
Half the people that have ever died on
the planet earth ever were killed by

1527
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:17,384
malaria

1528
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,620
at of all the reasons why people died.

1529
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,060
Car Accidents,

1530
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,680
plane crashes,

1531
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,913
AIDS,

1532
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,020
cancer,

1533
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,340
malaria,

1534
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,780
killed half of the people
that have ever died ever.

1535
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,840
Uh,

1536
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,470
how's that possible?

1537
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:35,740
Well,

1538
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,200
because malaria is a mother fucker.

1539
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,620
Malaria kills millions of people
that we just don't hear about it.

1540
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:43,810
Cause we don't get malaria in California.

1541
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,640
We don't get malaria in America.

1542
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,990
But if you're in Africa,

1543
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:49,000
you are fucking terrified of malaria.

1544
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,263
Hold on.

1545
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:50,871
Okay.

1546
00:40:50,871 --> 00:40:51,681
This is not a fact.

1547
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:52,580
That I'm sure is right.

1548
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:57,581
But black people with sickle cell anemia
develop the sickle cell gene to defend

1549
00:40:58,401 --> 00:40:59,180
against malaria.

1550
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,013
Correct.

1551
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,470
Whoa,

1552
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,370
I've never heard that before.

1553
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:02,890
Uh,

1554
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,291
Jamie,

1555
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,960
because someone helped me find
some type in sickle cell malaria.

1556
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:06,710
Wow.

1557
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,970
That's interesting of true.

1558
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:13,090
It's something to do with the sickle
cell gene is what is what protects black

1559
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:14,810
people in Africa for malaria.

1560
00:41:14,811 --> 00:41:16,400
Because the body tried to define it.

1561
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,500
I only know this because when
we were traveling to Africa,

1562
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:20,300
we had to take malaria
pills and they fucked me up.

1563
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,163
They really fucked.

1564
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,060
I heard they Cribble you.

1565
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,880
Oh my dreams were like insane.

1566
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,480
I've heard people saying that they would
rather get malaria then deal with the

1567
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:32,350
malaria medication cause they get malaria.

1568
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,100
Then they'd just get
antibiotics and get it taken

1569
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,580
care of.

1570
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,270
Mystery solved how sickle cell
hemoglobin protects against malaria.

1571
00:41:38,271 --> 00:41:38,970
Wow.

1572
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:39,221
Yeah.

1573
00:41:39,221 --> 00:41:40,740
Well I learned that in
Africa from a black dude.

1574
00:41:40,741 --> 00:41:40,921
He goes,

1575
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:41,251
when I go,

1576
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:42,720
how come you're not
taking him learn medicine?

1577
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:43,261
They said,

1578
00:41:43,261 --> 00:41:43,810
I'm black.

1579
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:47,530
A new article is likely to help solve
one of the longstanding mysteries of

1580
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:51,370
biomedicine in a study that
challenges currently held views.

1581
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:56,371
Researchers unraveled the molecular
mechanism whereby sickle cell hemoglobin

1582
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,390
confers.

1583
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,021
That's what says,

1584
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:02,740
confers a survival
advantage against malaria.

1585
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,540
Wow.

1586
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,463
That's racist.

1587
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,050
I have a buddy that died from sickle cell,

1588
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,280
uh,

1589
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,890
guys to train with back Boston.

1590
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,820
My friend Walter.

1591
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,360
Really?

1592
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:13,571
Yeah.

1593
00:42:13,571 --> 00:42:14,800
He was like really talented,

1594
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:17,200
a taekwondo fighter and he would uh,

1595
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:20,770
come in and train like really hard for
a short period of time and then he would

1596
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,450
get sick and uh,

1597
00:42:22,451 --> 00:42:24,310
he was always one of those
guys that everybody was like,

1598
00:42:24,311 --> 00:42:25,001
where's Walter?

1599
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:25,181
Like,

1600
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:25,370
where's,

1601
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,100
he was like super talented,

1602
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,993
really good,

1603
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,920
but he would get sick and he just couldn't
compete and then he would get better

1604
00:42:32,921 --> 00:42:34,450
and he would just look
like a world beater.

1605
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,160
He was like really fucking good,

1606
00:42:36,161 --> 00:42:37,030
really talented,

1607
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:37,864
really smart.

1608
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,410
Just knew,

1609
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,740
knew how to fight and then
just kept getting sickle cell.

1610
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,780
Just kept getting worse
and getting better.

1611
00:42:43,781 --> 00:42:44,614
And this is like

1612
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,230
early eighties,

1613
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:47,760
84

1614
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,500
or that's when it was taken out.

1615
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:50,400
Brothers left and right.

1616
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,630
Maybe even earlier than that.

1617
00:42:51,631 --> 00:42:52,590
It might have been 82.

1618
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,750
Who Do we sell them and Leroy's
Selman played for the bucks,

1619
00:42:54,751 --> 00:42:55,251
do we sell them?

1620
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:57,660
Was a defensive back and Dewey
Seldman had sickle cell anemia.

1621
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:58,710
That was first time I ever heard of it.

1622
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,410
But I remember telling my dad,

1623
00:43:01,411 --> 00:43:03,770
I think I have sickle cell anemia
because I'd heard this too.

1624
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,390
My Dad was like he black.

1625
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,740
I don't think so.

1626
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,350
That's amazing that it came from malaria.

1627
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,220
Yeah,

1628
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,540
well it makes it makes sense.

1629
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,770
I mean you,

1630
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:18,780
your body or the human body is going to
try to figure out some way to get over

1631
00:43:18,781 --> 00:43:19,614
this hump.

1632
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,870
This is the most deadly
disease I think ever.

1633
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,520
If I had a gas,

1634
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,120
I would say malaria is probably
the most deadly disease ever.

1635
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,440
But everybody's scared of it.

1636
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:28,650
Right.

1637
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:29,161
I'll tell you what,

1638
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:31,470
rabies is pretty fucking bad cause I got,

1639
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,150
I got bit by a bat and
Costa Rica very bad.

1640
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:34,651
And I thought,

1641
00:43:34,651 --> 00:43:35,370
I thought,

1642
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,060
I thought I had,

1643
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,600
I,

1644
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,640
I was like I got bit by a bat
and you get the rabies shot.

1645
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,361
And they were all,

1646
00:43:39,361 --> 00:43:42,450
you know Costa Cause I
pulled Avida man a pure life.

1647
00:43:42,451 --> 00:43:43,970
Don't worry now you fine.

1648
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,940
We don't have rabies down here.

1649
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,833
Thought he'd be fine.

1650
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,490
And then I go back and I come back to,

1651
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:47,970
you know,

1652
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,090
get my shots to go again.

1653
00:43:49,091 --> 00:43:50,070
And they said you want a rabies shot?

1654
00:43:50,071 --> 00:43:50,700
I said,

1655
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,000
I've been bit by about once and the
lady freaked and like laid it on me.

1656
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:54,834
She was like,

1657
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,171
she goes,

1658
00:43:55,171 --> 00:43:55,381
you know,

1659
00:43:55,381 --> 00:43:57,990
there's no recovery from rabies.

1660
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,880
Like if you do in fact have rabies,

1661
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,230
you'll die from rabies.

1662
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:01,511
No.

1663
00:44:01,511 --> 00:44:02,190
And that's not true.

1664
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,120
100% no,

1665
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:03,954
no,

1666
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,100
nope.

1667
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,170
Not One person has ever knocked,

1668
00:44:07,171 --> 00:44:09,090
gotten bit by rabies,

1669
00:44:09,091 --> 00:44:10,440
gotten the shots in two days.

1670
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:15,060
You got to him and within two days
and ever lived ever fucking lip.

1671
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:15,460
Now,

1672
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,140
so everybody who gets rabies,

1673
00:44:17,141 --> 00:44:18,850
even if you get the
shots inside of two days,

1674
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:19,590
you still die.

1675
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,261
If you get the shit,

1676
00:44:20,261 --> 00:44:23,200
you have to get the shots within two
days and then you live and then you live.

1677
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:23,740
Yes.

1678
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,060
But if you don't get those shots,

1679
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:25,811
oh,

1680
00:44:25,811 --> 00:44:26,501
I see what you're saying.

1681
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:28,000
So if you don't get the shots,

1682
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:29,710
you're dead a hundred percent

1683
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,800
five months later you're sitting in a bed,

1684
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:32,634
you start feeling sick.

1685
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,530
When he's a scary man,

1686
00:44:35,531 --> 00:44:37,050
it starts with a sore back.

1687
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,030
How many fucking times I
lay in a hotel bed going,

1688
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:39,860
God damn it.

1689
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,550
Or rabies kicking in
these fucking scared me.

1690
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,820
You hypochondriacs Camacho.

1691
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,650
I'm worse than you have.

1692
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:49,810
No,

1693
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,840
you never heard about when I
thought I got genital warts,

1694
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,040
what happened?

1695
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,873
Oh,

1696
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,470
did you like get a macro thing?

1697
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,330
Magnifying glass and no,

1698
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,980
look at the little individual cells.

1699
00:44:59,070 --> 00:44:59,610
No.

1700
00:44:59,610 --> 00:44:59,791
Oh,

1701
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:00,624
it looks weird.

1702
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:01,681
No,

1703
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:05,220
but I did sit with my balls and Dick's
and a bowl of vinegar watching quantum

1704
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:07,890
leap drink a 40 vinegar because vinegar,

1705
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:08,580
I don't know man.

1706
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,080
I got fucked.

1707
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,770
Get obsessive,

1708
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,310
right?

1709
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,800
No vinegar will tell you
if you have genital warts,

1710
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:14,180
so that's hilarious.

1711
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,430
Let's tell you it.

1712
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:18,310
The march we just slept,

1713
00:45:18,311 --> 00:45:18,800
you know,

1714
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,220
it'll whisper to you.

1715
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:21,651
You look down,

1716
00:45:21,651 --> 00:45:22,760
it's an exclamation point.

1717
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,300
Never had one of those times where you
looked at your dick a bunch like you like

1718
00:45:26,301 --> 00:45:29,000
have sex one night and then the next
day you like kind of giving you a dick a

1719
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:29,781
once over and you're like,

1720
00:45:29,781 --> 00:45:29,931
wait,

1721
00:45:29,931 --> 00:45:30,764
what the fuck is that?

1722
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:34,700
It's kind of amazing how rarely
guys do give their dick a once over.

1723
00:45:34,701 --> 00:45:37,280
Like how often do you like
what we're dealing with here?

1724
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:38,943
Every time

1725
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,800
I go through the left,

1726
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,380
look to the right side down.

1727
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:44,570
So He's there and I'm like,

1728
00:45:44,571 --> 00:45:45,710
I got him pinned in Jujitsu.

1729
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,140
Stare at your sac
underneath in the mirror.

1730
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,570
Paul Becker.

1731
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:50,560
Was it just from fucking,

1732
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:52,420
was it just like a sore
from fucking too hard?

1733
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,140
Well,

1734
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,700
it started out as nothing.

1735
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,460
You got to start off with a one night
stand and I was working at Barnes and

1736
00:45:57,461 --> 00:46:00,580
noble and I went into the bathroom and I
was looking at my dick nonstop and then

1737
00:46:00,581 --> 00:46:02,020
I start looking at those web journals,

1738
00:46:02,021 --> 00:46:06,070
those Ma not web during med med
journals and then s and then I,

1739
00:46:06,071 --> 00:46:06,611
and then I was like,

1740
00:46:06,611 --> 00:46:06,760
Oh,

1741
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,190
you know what?

1742
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:07,741
Like like,

1743
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:08,210
and this is,

1744
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:11,320
I don't know if anyone has
obsessive compulsive a hypochondria.

1745
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,340
This is how it works.

1746
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:12,671
You're like,

1747
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:13,031
you know what?

1748
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:13,541
I'm going to be fine.

1749
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:15,100
I'm going to go get some stuff at cvs,

1750
00:46:15,101 --> 00:46:15,701
put it on my balls,

1751
00:46:15,701 --> 00:46:16,870
I will notice anything in the morning.

1752
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:17,704
And next thing you know,

1753
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,820
you're rubbing lotions and ton acton and
fucking putting shit all of your balls

1754
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:25,390
and Dick's thinking you're going to fix
something and then it looks worse the

1755
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:25,751
next day.

1756
00:46:25,751 --> 00:46:26,201
And then you're like,

1757
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:26,501
all right,

1758
00:46:26,501 --> 00:46:28,300
listen to if all I gotta do is I got to,

1759
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:28,931
I'm going to,

1760
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:29,750
I'm going to do the tonight,

1761
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:33,160
I'm stay with an act and then I'm going
to get my bowls and Dick and a bowl of

1762
00:46:33,161 --> 00:46:34,420
vinegar tonight and that'll tell me.

1763
00:46:34,421 --> 00:46:37,240
And the next thing you know your Dick
and balls would just give me getting a

1764
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:40,970
fucking beating for like two days
and then I'll look normal anymore.

1765
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,580
And now you can't stop fucking with them.

1766
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:45,520
You are literally like fucking magic dad.

1767
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,473
Nonstop.

1768
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,450
Nonstop.

1769
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:48,740
I'm not the only one
that's been through this.

1770
00:46:48,741 --> 00:46:49,730
I know there are people
who have done this.

1771
00:46:49,731 --> 00:46:52,820
A lot of guys out there pickle in their
balls and deck pickle in there and you

1772
00:46:52,821 --> 00:46:53,400
just,

1773
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,233
and then,

1774
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:56,500
and then you're an affiliate and
you can't stop looking at your desk.

1775
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,040
You just like nonstop.

1776
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,090
And why does it have to be filling?

1777
00:46:59,100 --> 00:46:59,930
Cause that's where I went.

1778
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:00,920
I went to Philly here,

1779
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,390
would affiliate with my cousin.

1780
00:47:02,391 --> 00:47:02,551
Hey,

1781
00:47:02,551 --> 00:47:05,020
but I stayed in this place and
I was fucking listen to my name,

1782
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,460
come take a look at my cock and vinegar.

1783
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:08,780
And I literally go pickle.

1784
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,390
Every conversation you
start starts with like,

1785
00:47:11,391 --> 00:47:11,710
you know,

1786
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:12,230
uh,

1787
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,400
genital warts is very cold.

1788
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:15,081
And then,

1789
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:15,340
uh,

1790
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,100
and then it went,

1791
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:16,760
it took,

1792
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,001
I mean,

1793
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,010
I'll be very honest.

1794
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,833
Uh,

1795
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,853
uh,

1796
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,380
I went to a dermatologist in Tampa.

1797
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:24,910
I like spiraled out my mom like said,

1798
00:47:24,911 --> 00:47:25,690
come home,

1799
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:26,440
you're fucking,

1800
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,340
something's going wrong with you.

1801
00:47:27,341 --> 00:47:29,350
I flew home and I like,

1802
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:34,000
you had to fly home to deal with this
and it wasn't even general warts was it?

1803
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,950
Even by the way,

1804
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,880
in your Dick and vinegar,

1805
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:38,190
you got to get on a plane.

1806
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,530
All Jesus Christ use hydrogen peroxide.

1807
00:47:41,531 --> 00:47:42,031
It's way better than,

1808
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:42,864
than vinegar.

1809
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:43,860
Yeah.

1810
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,080
You know,

1811
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:44,950
why are you using vinegar?

1812
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:45,611
You're just kind of starting,

1813
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:46,011
by the way.

1814
00:47:46,011 --> 00:47:47,710
Did we didn't have the Internet back then.

1815
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,470
We have the Internet back
then marinate your Dick.

1816
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:51,723
Just don't,

1817
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:53,351
just don't,

1818
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:55,150
don't try any home remedies.

1819
00:47:55,151 --> 00:47:56,560
Did you even bother googling it?

1820
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:56,921
Oh,

1821
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:57,760
Google wasn't around.

1822
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:58,391
Oh,

1823
00:47:58,391 --> 00:47:58,870
that's right.

1824
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,530
This was like,

1825
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,570
this is right when I
moved to New York by 1997.

1826
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:02,111
So yeah,

1827
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:05,170
you'd have to get an encyclopedia and
you know how hard those were standup to

1828
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:06,590
thumb through the fucking do.

1829
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,410
Does anyone remember the
Dewey decimal system?

1830
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:11,740
Like that fucking was
so complicated to me.

1831
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,480
Like I never learned
it and I never had to.

1832
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,140
Do you like do they even
cover that kind of stuff?

1833
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,170
Like if you got an encyclopedia
or a medical encyclopedia,

1834
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:24,220
would they talk about Dick Wards and
home remedies like pickling your Dick and

1835
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:25,054
vinegar,

1836
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,440
where would you get that data?

1837
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,520
Figlin Dick and vinegar.

1838
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:29,110
I probably did get from the Internet.

1839
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,160
The Internet was around.

1840
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:31,780
It just wasn't like what it is today.

1841
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:35,110
There was those books as homeroom Mindy
books like medical books though my mom

1842
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:35,651
used to have like,

1843
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:38,810
like a kind of a book that like if you
have a fever and you don't have Tylenol

1844
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,400
tried to this,

1845
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,480
you know words to that though.

1846
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:43,540
It was like sure they had something
they had to in rewards back then.

1847
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,100
I wonder if they talked about it though,

1848
00:48:45,101 --> 00:48:49,510
because there's a certain innocence to
that time where they just lay like to

1849
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:52,990
sweep stuff under the rug and not
talk about it for the longest time.

1850
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:54,183
I wonder,

1851
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:54,630
you know,

1852
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:56,710
I wonder how much of that was discussed.

1853
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,040
It probably called something
different back then too.

1854
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,640
Like Indian mounds or something.

1855
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,193
What?

1856
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:02,660
Uh,

1857
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,940
I don't know if that's right,

1858
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,540
but I'll tell you what,

1859
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:11,710
there wasn't a lot of information back
then and it was just what you'd get was

1860
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:15,610
like literally what you'd get on the
Internet now if your battery was dying.

1861
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,340
Like that's the kind of
internet information you get.

1862
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,870
That's why aids was so scary
because nobody made you.

1863
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:23,201
Yeah,

1864
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:23,681
I mean you,

1865
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:26,680
you would have to like wait
til a news report came out.

1866
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,430
Yeah.

1867
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,040
To find out like how you could get it,

1868
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:29,841
how you couldn't get it.

1869
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:30,970
And when's the vaccine coming?

1870
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,160
2020 was how people found out about aids.

1871
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:33,581
Yeah,

1872
00:49:33,581 --> 00:49:34,090
man,

1873
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:35,320
stop and think about that.

1874
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,210
Unless you read some Newsweek article,

1875
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,770
like you had to read some,

1876
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:42,160
some article and then it was up
to the person writing the article.

1877
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,460
Like they had a tremendous
responsibility to get the facts right,

1878
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,020
which they don't always do.

1879
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:47,861
You know,

1880
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,120
and then the facts change,

1881
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,040
especially when it comes
to science and medicine,

1882
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:51,731
like the facts,

1883
00:49:51,731 --> 00:49:52,564
they change,

1884
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,081
you know,

1885
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:54,430
they find out new discoveries.

1886
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,690
They have to back date things,

1887
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:57,160
they have to change
things you have to fit.

1888
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,810
Oh well now there's a great,

1889
00:49:59,160 --> 00:49:59,350
uh,

1890
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:02,290
believe it was radio lab.

1891
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:03,640
There was a great,

1892
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:08,850
yes it was radio lab on patient zero
and it was all on the origins of aids,

1893
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:09,491
how it happened.

1894
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:13,060
And they think it happened
from a hunter in Africa.

1895
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:18,240
They think that it was a combination of
two different diseases that different

1896
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:18,881
monkeys,

1897
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:19,510
God,

1898
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:22,060
and they probably got it
from eating each other.

1899
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,960
And that a hunter who killed a monkey
and was cutting the meat up must have cut

1900
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,730
his hand and gotten that
monkey blood in his,

1901
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,660
in his body.

1902
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,130
So the virus got into him and
that was the origins of HIV.

1903
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,301
He was gay.

1904
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,620
Fucking fascinating.

1905
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:40,940
I had nothing to do with get well,

1906
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,060
I mean if he was okay,

1907
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:46,550
well but that might have had
sex with a woman or it might.

1908
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,480
It's just by virtue of
the way men have sex,

1909
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,710
gay men have sex.

1910
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:53,540
It made it easier for them to spread it.

1911
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,713
That's available.

1912
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:55,010
Yeah,

1913
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:55,843
more susceptible.

1914
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:56,870
And then on top of it,

1915
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,620
there's the gay community loves to party,

1916
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:01,521
you know,

1917
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:05,060
and that's like a big thing that that
Peter Duesberg guy that we had on that was

1918
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,800
super controversial men.

1919
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:08,540
I never had more people get mad at me.

1920
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,220
Then you and Brian.

1921
00:51:10,221 --> 00:51:10,760
Carolyn,

1922
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,240
yes.

1923
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:11,710
And that guy,

1924
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:15,110
I heard that who was a professor of
biology at the University of California

1925
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:20,111
Berkeley and he has this insanely
controversial viewpoint on aids and 90 but

1926
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:21,041
one,

1927
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:26,041
I'm just say this before I repeat what
he believes that 99% of the people that

1928
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:28,910
are in his field disagree with him.

1929
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:29,871
This is a very,

1930
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:31,520
very small people,

1931
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,890
small percentage of people
that might just be him.

1932
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:34,911
So this is,

1933
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:35,744
but this is his,

1934
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,070
his friends belief.

1935
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,490
He believes that HIV
is actually weak virus.

1936
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:45,730
And he said that what it is a symptom of
is a compromised immune system and that

1937
00:51:46,131 --> 00:51:48,710
your immune system is
compromised from drugs.

1938
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,120
And one of the things that he connected
is the amount of people that die from

1939
00:51:53,121 --> 00:51:53,451
aids,

1940
00:51:53,451 --> 00:51:56,240
complications that were heavy
drug users in the gay community.

1941
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:59,180
And it's overwhelming crazy numbers,

1942
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:02,600
crazy numbers because they're
do ll night trade and poppers,

1943
00:52:02,601 --> 00:52:05,930
which are poppers and math and they just
love to party because they don't have

1944
00:52:05,931 --> 00:52:10,070
kids and they but fucking woo seventh
grade old time having a good time man.

1945
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:11,363
Um,

1946
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:16,720
so it was his contention that HIV was
just a symptom that their immune system

1947
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:20,330
was already fucked up and that if,

1948
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:24,710
if we looked at it correctly instead
of from a social point of view,

1949
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,930
everybody's looking at it
as like a social stigma.

1950
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:30,140
It's something that can't be questioned
because it's such a blight on the gay

1951
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:32,920
community and we should all
rally and help them and you,

1952
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,280
you can't question what,

1953
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:35,600
what's actually going on.

1954
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:38,630
They obviously have a disease that's
killing them off and we need research and

1955
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:39,464
funding and all this.

1956
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,580
And he was saying when you get outside
of that cloud of emotion that's attached

1957
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:44,290
to this and,

1958
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,860
and politically correct thinking.

1959
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,900
And one common denominator you see with
these people with a lot of them is heavy

1960
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:51,734
drug use.

1961
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,970
So what he believed is that your immune
system gets shattered from doing all the

1962
00:52:55,971 --> 00:52:59,180
drugs and then when they
test you HIV shows up,

1963
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,940
but they raised the HIV is there,

1964
00:53:01,941 --> 00:53:03,140
it's like if you are healthy,

1965
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:04,700
your body would battle the HIV.

1966
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,060
Now HIV researchers think
he's out of his fucking mind,

1967
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:12,230
but they are saying that there is ways
to make it so the you HIV doesn't show up

1968
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:12,840
the people's body.

1969
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,640
Exactly,

1970
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,150
yes.

1971
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:14,660
That's,

1972
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,310
that's more recently,

1973
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,480
that's within the last,

1974
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:19,460
I believe the last decade or so.

1975
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,310
I think those things are
called protease inhibitors.

1976
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,350
And I think that's one
of the ways that they,

1977
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,740
uh,

1978
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,890
have figured out how to,

1979
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,660
I think they have even better stuff now.

1980
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:28,590
Um,

1981
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,200
I don't know what the
latest in HIV medication is,

1982
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,860
but if they have something that could uh,

1983
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:37,920
make it get to that point,

1984
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:41,400
you would kind of assume
that that would like,

1985
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:41,821
I know,

1986
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:43,380
I know a few people actually that have it,

1987
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,530
that have HIV and they take
the drugs and they are,

1988
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,393
um,

1989
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,060
one of our friends works at the
comedy store and they are uh,

1990
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,770
unperceptive and in December you don't,

1991
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,480
what's the word?

1992
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,730
Presumable perceivable.

1993
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,400
Thank you.

1994
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:56,851
You can't,

1995
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:58,080
you can't test it when,

1996
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:01,710
when you test them they show up negative
but he knows that he has it somehow or

1997
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:01,930
another,

1998
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:05,970
it's like dormant in the system and if
his immune system drops down and it gets

1999
00:54:05,971 --> 00:54:08,580
all fucked up but could be parties
too hard or something like that and he

2000
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:09,600
doesn't take his medication,

2001
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,930
maybe it would come back and see that
doesn't necessarily mean that Duesberg is

2002
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:13,530
right.

2003
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:13,860
It's,

2004
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,131
it's,

2005
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:14,431
it's,

2006
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:15,750
it seems very complicated.

2007
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:19,650
It seems like the doing
the drugs doesn't help.

2008
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:23,310
That's what it seems like to me to say
that the doing the drugs is the reason

2009
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:24,900
that these people should get aids.

2010
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:27,320
And it's not the HIV and the drugs,

2011
00:54:27,321 --> 00:54:29,280
it was compromising their immune system.

2012
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,100
That's not necessarily true because
there's not a lot of people that are just

2013
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:35,820
getting HIV and then getting
better on their own with no drugs,

2014
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,110
with no medication.

2015
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:42,320
So it could be that one thing we all know
is it doing a lot of drugs is bad for

2016
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:42,871
your body.

2017
00:54:42,871 --> 00:54:46,590
So when they're doing crystal meth and
Emile nitrate and they getting crazy and

2018
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:47,424
not getting any sleep,

2019
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:51,590
that's terrible for your body and any
disease that you have when your body's

2020
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,360
already wrecked is going to
have a better grip on you.

2021
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:55,530
This just the fact,

2022
00:54:55,531 --> 00:54:55,790
yeah,

2023
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:57,120
when we all know that that's the,

2024
00:54:57,121 --> 00:54:59,010
that's what the common cold with the flu,

2025
00:54:59,011 --> 00:54:59,844
with anything,

2026
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:02,910
you have the flu and you get fucking
hammered and start doing meth.

2027
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,350
You're gonna feel like shit,

2028
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:05,011
you know,

2029
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:06,330
because your body's already wrecked.

2030
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:07,830
Your immune system's already torched.

2031
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:13,370
So I don't necessarily think that his
conclusions make a lot of sense to me.

2032
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,410
A nonscientific nonmedical person,

2033
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:17,723
I think.

2034
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,780
I think he probably one of the reasons
why all these people are angry at him

2035
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:26,730
cause he's jumped to some unscientific
conclusions or some conclusions at least

2036
00:55:26,731 --> 00:55:29,040
that they don't think are scientific or,

2037
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,810
or just politically incorrect,

2038
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:34,320
but definitely politically incorrect
and that's what a lot of us are

2039
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:35,101
researchers,

2040
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:35,341
man,

2041
00:55:35,341 --> 00:55:36,570
they've spent decades.

2042
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,051
You know,

2043
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:41,640
the cynical point of view is that like
people that are conspiracy theorists

2044
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:42,390
would say,

2045
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:42,661
you know,

2046
00:55:42,661 --> 00:55:43,170
hey,

2047
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:46,440
the money is in the
treatment and the cure man.

2048
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:47,101
You know,

2049
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:49,110
what they want to do is I'm
going to continue making money.

2050
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,730
You'd have to be extremely cynical
to think that that's the case.

2051
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,470
Like they say that about cancer,

2052
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:59,070
but they kind of know how to
stop cancer in a lot of ways.

2053
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:03,360
They could prevent a significant amount
of cancer if people just cleaned up

2054
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,194
their diet,

2055
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,280
cleaned up their diet,

2056
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:06,930
started eating healthy and exercising,

2057
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,380
that would,

2058
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,820
that would stop a lot of it.

2059
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:09,690
A lot of it.

2060
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:10,411
What percentage,

2061
00:56:10,411 --> 00:56:11,070
I don't know.

2062
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,220
But if you cut sugar out of your diet
and you started eating healthy and you

2063
00:56:14,221 --> 00:56:16,140
started exercising on a daily basis,

2064
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,200
how many people would be way
healthier than they are now?

2065
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,130
Probably a lot.

2066
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:23,100
And now there's definitely people
that get cancer because of genetics.

2067
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:23,620
There's that.

2068
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,840
It's not all of it is due
to poor diet and stress,

2069
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,860
but that can help when your immune
system's going bonkers and you,

2070
00:56:30,861 --> 00:56:33,100
you're fucking tired and
stressed out all the time.

2071
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,180
That shit ain't good.

2072
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:34,900
But it does,

2073
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,171
you know.

2074
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:38,920
So that's all it's everyone's
looking for a one or the other.

2075
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:41,890
They are looking to point the finger
at like one source and I think it's a

2076
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:44,110
combination of a bunch of different
things that makes your rack

2077
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:44,711
see.

2078
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:46,420
I always thought the CIA created aids.

2079
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:51,490
Did you hear that presidential
thing that came out this week?

2080
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:55,630
Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev?

2081
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:55,891
No.

2082
00:56:55,891 --> 00:56:56,050
No.

2083
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:59,170
Like them talking about HIV and
aids are in the know or late.

2084
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,010
They pretty much,

2085
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:02,080
they were just making fun of
it and like people were like,

2086
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,940
where's the prison going
to mouth a mouth kiss?

2087
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:04,470
And,

2088
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,430
and they weren't taking it serious at all.

2089
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:07,170
And like the,

2090
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:08,200
the press was like,

2091
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,680
are you guys not taking
aid serious or HIV series?

2092
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:13,810
And they just continued to joke about it,

2093
00:57:13,811 --> 00:57:15,700
like Reagan's administration
and stuff like that.

2094
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,170
Audio about it.

2095
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,530
Do you remember that woman who was a
publicist who made that joke on Twitter

2096
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,833
line?

2097
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,430
That's a book I read is uh,

2098
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,630
so you've been publicly shamed?

2099
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,110
Yeah.

2100
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:26,351
Oh,

2101
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:26,750
okay.

2102
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:26,840
Yeah.

2103
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,190
John Ronson Justine's Soco was,

2104
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:32,140
I mean it fucking destroyed her life.

2105
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,550
Now I'm not even,

2106
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,330
I'll tell you what,

2107
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:35,350
I'm this far out of it.

2108
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:36,461
The stuff,

2109
00:57:36,461 --> 00:57:40,060
I read the book like where she works now
and I've heard stories about her now I

2110
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:41,980
won't even share cause I
don't like public shaming.

2111
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,060
I don't think it works.

2112
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:43,990
And I don't think it's,

2113
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,610
I don't think it's benefit to anyone.

2114
00:57:45,611 --> 00:57:48,310
I think it makes just makes
the people that shame good.

2115
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,960
Wait a cotton picking minute.

2116
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:52,960
I don't like what you're saying.

2117
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,053
I like it.

2118
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:55,691
Oh,

2119
00:57:55,691 --> 00:57:55,980
I don't,

2120
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:56,813
I don't like it either.

2121
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:57,670
I think,

2122
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:58,180
again,

2123
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,410
it's what we were saying earlier,

2124
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,330
it's this,

2125
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,460
it's these people that are
just looking to be outrage.

2126
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,490
That's a big part of it.

2127
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:06,070
And there's some things that you
probably should shame people for.

2128
00:58:06,071 --> 00:58:07,060
Like Bill Cosby,

2129
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,210
like if you want to go around and
drugging and weight raping women,

2130
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:10,661
yeah,

2131
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:11,830
you should be shamed for that.

2132
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:12,341
But you really,

2133
00:58:12,341 --> 00:58:15,460
you should be prosecuted if you're
not prosecuted than definitely shamed.

2134
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,280
But like,

2135
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:16,840
but like,

2136
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,950
but like get prosecuted me.

2137
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:20,440
Let them go to fucking jail and
I don't really care to shame him.

2138
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:21,310
Just send him away.

2139
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,170
He's definitely experiencing hell,

2140
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:24,010
right.

2141
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:26,170
Whether whether they lock
him in a cage or not,

2142
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:27,070
I don't give a fuck of that.

2143
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:28,690
Guys living in the lap of luxury,

2144
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,300
he's experiencing hell because
he's gone from being a guy,

2145
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,230
been loved his entire career.

2146
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:34,460
He's like revered.

2147
00:58:34,461 --> 00:58:34,760
He's like,

2148
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:34,881
well,

2149
00:58:34,881 --> 00:58:35,714
you look at him,

2150
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,770
he's one of the great,

2151
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,990
if you had a mount
Rushmore of standup comedy,

2152
00:58:38,991 --> 00:58:40,670
you'd have to put bill
Cosby's head on there.

2153
00:58:40,671 --> 00:58:41,390
You'd have to,

2154
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:41,571
yeah.

2155
00:58:41,571 --> 00:58:43,160
But he's impervious to,

2156
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,420
he's impervious to shame.

2157
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:44,780
I bet.

2158
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,160
I bet it's like a great white shark.

2159
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,940
He was so fucking condescending
to everyone he spoke to.

2160
00:58:49,941 --> 00:58:53,030
I heard the theory ever
fucking met someone with like,

2161
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:53,721
Hey man,

2162
00:58:53,721 --> 00:58:54,081
I'm bill.

2163
00:58:54,081 --> 00:58:58,000
Nice to meet ya soul like
just staring down like DC Ben.

2164
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:58,641
He's got a story of that.

2165
00:58:58,641 --> 00:59:00,590
Just the way he treated
him in DC was like,

2166
00:59:00,591 --> 00:59:01,520
what a fucking Dick.

2167
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:02,360
What happened?

2168
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,021
I don't know.

2169
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:03,771
I'm fucking,

2170
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:05,780
it was probably 12 years
ago that I heard the story.

2171
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,930
So for me to repeat it,

2172
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,480
start making up stuff.

2173
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:13,540
DC walks into his trailer and bill
Cosby's raping this woman in DC.

2174
00:59:13,911 --> 00:59:14,661
He's like a,

2175
00:59:14,661 --> 00:59:17,030
I do a great impression of you
and started doing it and go,

2176
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,290
cause he was right when the woman,

2177
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,550
the girl starts waking up,

2178
00:59:19,551 --> 00:59:20,750
she hears bill Cosby.

2179
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,040
Bill like not cool man.

2180
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,240
I don't use my voice with them.

2181
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:24,140
That's,

2182
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,351
I mean,

2183
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:25,250
that's what DC told me.

2184
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,770
Did he have like a luchador mask on it?

2185
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:29,331
That's what I heard.

2186
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:29,750
Yeah.

2187
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,730
I think when I'm Mexican wrestling masks,

2188
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,773
that's what I heard.

2189
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,360
I think so old school bill Cosby.

2190
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,463
Yeah.

2191
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:39,260
But what were you gonna
say about Justine Sacco?

2192
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:39,890
Oh,

2193
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,020
well that's a perfect story.

2194
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:45,170
When we talk about someone like
cracking a joke about aids,

2195
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,020
you know she mateze
picked fairly recently.

2196
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:49,310
She was talking about going to Africa.

2197
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:49,971
She goes,

2198
00:59:49,971 --> 00:59:51,320
I think the exact quote was,

2199
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,440
I'm going to Africa hope
that I get don't get aids.

2200
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:55,221
Lol.

2201
00:59:55,221 --> 00:59:55,731
Just kidding.

2202
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:56,564
I'm white.

2203
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:57,453
Yeah.

2204
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:00,970
She says she's just,

2205
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:03,080
and she tried to say,

2206
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:05,570
I think that it was like that.

2207
01:00:05,571 --> 01:00:08,870
She was pointing out the disparity
of how white people did it.

2208
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:11,780
She just did a poor job at
please bitch cracking a joke.

2209
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,350
Cause she,

2210
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,720
she was in that first
generation of funny girl.

2211
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,021
No,

2212
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:15,241
I'm to,

2213
01:00:15,241 --> 01:00:17,600
I'm going to say girls only because
they ran the internet at this time.

2214
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:18,260
They were Twitter.

2215
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,310
Was she black too?

2216
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:19,610
No,

2217
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:19,821
no.

2218
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:24,821
But there was a bunch of girls that
women that overtook and showed people how

2219
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:28,430
funny women were on the Internet
through Jenny Johnson high five.

2220
01:00:28,431 --> 01:00:29,360
Jenny Molan,

2221
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:29,961
Jay Johnson,

2222
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:30,411
high fives.

2223
01:00:30,411 --> 01:00:31,130
Very funny.

2224
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:31,970
Fucking really.

2225
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:33,200
She says some really funny shit.

2226
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:33,921
Slash.

2227
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:34,281
Lien.

2228
01:00:34,281 --> 01:00:35,770
Our friends slash thing from Toronto,

2229
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,633
Oxford.

2230
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,060
They're all funny and it's women.

2231
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:41,660
And she was in that first generation of
those women who would post outrageous

2232
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:42,060
shit.

2233
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:45,440
Jenny Kenny Kelly
Oxford's posted what time?

2234
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:46,480
And I fucking lost it.

2235
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,850
I lost it laughing and she deleted
it cause she was afraid of it,

2236
01:00:49,851 --> 01:00:54,851
I think was that a women who like meant
women who wear pads love to smell their

2237
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:56,420
menstruation.

2238
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:56,960
Whoa.

2239
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,800
And I loved that.

2240
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,000
I just thought it was my wife's like,

2241
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,100
my wife would never wear
a pad like in her life.

2242
01:01:01,101 --> 01:01:02,810
I remember someone offered a packs.

2243
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:03,321
He had a period.

2244
01:01:03,321 --> 01:01:03,531
It's like,

2245
01:01:03,531 --> 01:01:04,310
what pad?

2246
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:05,930
I'd rather put a sock in my fucking pants.

2247
01:01:05,931 --> 01:01:06,890
What are you fucking kidding me?

2248
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,990
Hadn't people hate Tampon people?

2249
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:09,630
Yeah.

2250
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:11,110
Looks like a war going on.

2251
01:01:11,111 --> 01:01:12,140
You see in Mac,

2252
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:16,490
the first PC and Mac first generation.

2253
01:01:16,491 --> 01:01:17,324
But that fight.

2254
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:18,220
But uh,

2255
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,750
but I think Justine sacco
was in that group of women.

2256
01:01:20,751 --> 01:01:21,260
She was,

2257
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,093
I didn't know that.

2258
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,620
I didn't know she was always Ligo.

2259
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:23,870
Not,

2260
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:24,770
not like friends with them,

2261
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:25,640
but it was funny,

2262
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:26,503
that generation of,

2263
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,580
she had had a bunch of outrageous tweets.

2264
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,750
I in the book,

2265
01:01:29,751 --> 01:01:34,040
I read that from John Ronson that she
was just outrageous and funny and would

2266
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:35,210
say the inappropriate things.

2267
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:36,770
And then all of a sudden got,

2268
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,430
there's another,

2269
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:41,810
there's a young lady who
worked with mentally disabled
adults who took a picture

2270
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,970
at Arlington cemetery where it said,

2271
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,170
uh,

2272
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:46,970
please be quiet and be respectful.

2273
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,850
And she did this like fake
yelling and flipping off thing.

2274
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,310
The girl's life got destroyed,

2275
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,420
destroyed.

2276
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:58,420
And apparently her thing was posting funny
pictures of her doing the opposite of

2277
01:01:58,851 --> 01:01:59,690
whatever the sign said.

2278
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,480
Science had no smoking in her
with a cigarette and a lighter.

2279
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:02,770
Yeah.

2280
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:02,980
Yeah.

2281
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:03,350
And like,

2282
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,400
and like an over the top.

2283
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:04,940
Yeah.

2284
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:05,750
Girl picture.

2285
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:08,600
She got destroyed to the
point where she didn't,

2286
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:09,500
she's like,

2287
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,470
I don't want to get my name
cleanse because I'm afraid
I'll come back up in the

2288
01:02:12,471 --> 01:02:15,290
thing because they can
now clean your name.

2289
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,550
Here's the real one.

2290
01:02:16,551 --> 01:02:17,390
There's one that fucked up.

2291
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:18,350
Clean your name.

2292
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:18,920
There's,

2293
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,190
what does that mean companies

2294
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,660
that they go through the cleaner and it
sounds like the professionals at French

2295
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:25,150
guy.

2296
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:25,983
What's that guy?

2297
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:26,933
Uh,

2298
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,320
no,

2299
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:27,630
the,

2300
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:31,070
the professional side though.

2301
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:31,501
The,

2302
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:32,130
yeah,

2303
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,000
they go through,

2304
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:33,900
they do it a lot.

2305
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,840
I think they think they
do it for sex offenders.

2306
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:37,620
Whoa.

2307
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,760
And uh,

2308
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,610
by my reading comprehension
skills aren't tops,

2309
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:45,210
but like for people that don't want their
name on the Internet for whatever the

2310
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:46,044
fuck they did,

2311
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:48,840
guys that have been convicted of rape.

2312
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:49,500
Right.

2313
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,880
And so what they do is they basically
you pay them and then they flood the

2314
01:02:53,881 --> 01:02:58,200
Internet with websites that your name
comes up on and fake pop up that you go to

2315
01:02:58,201 --> 01:03:00,630
the website and it says temporarily
unavailable or whatever.

2316
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,340
And they just flood
the Internet with that.

2317
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:05,760
So that when you do find Justine soccer,

2318
01:03:05,761 --> 01:03:10,761
what's number seven on the list and
number one is a semifinal final semi final

2319
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,080
medalist for the,

2320
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:14,460
this uh,

2321
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:15,850
ran a five k.

2322
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:18,840
So they just add shit to the
internet to flood the water.

2323
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:21,840
So it makes it more difficult
to find information about you.

2324
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,350
That would be the smart thing to deal
with if somebody was fucking with you,

2325
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:30,740
hire someone to write complete
fiction about you all the time,

2326
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,520
like all day long.

2327
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:32,790
Like,

2328
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:33,930
just make up shit,

2329
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:37,830
get to the point where it's
like finally thinly veiled,

2330
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:39,750
like it's very difficult
to tell like what's true,

2331
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:44,250
what's not like almost like an onion
story and just hire someone to do that all

2332
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:44,460
day.

2333
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,100
So like if Justine sacco
had like a pile of cash,

2334
01:03:47,101 --> 01:03:50,880
if she was a scrooge McDuck and she just
sat back with all our cash and said,

2335
01:03:50,881 --> 01:03:51,181
you know what,

2336
01:03:51,181 --> 01:03:55,800
I'm just going to hire a team of creative
writers and it just going to tell my

2337
01:03:55,801 --> 01:03:56,634
story.

2338
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,500
What's that like to just tell her story,

2339
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:03,501
make up stories all day long about things
that she did like constantly and make

2340
01:04:03,751 --> 01:04:04,230
them,

2341
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:08,640
some of them seem reasonable and some
of them seem completely ridiculous.

2342
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:09,690
I hate to say this.

2343
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:10,920
You're that guy.

2344
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:12,210
What do you mean no cause you,

2345
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,680
I remember you,

2346
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:14,401
I'm sure you remember.

2347
01:04:14,401 --> 01:04:15,060
I hate to say this.

2348
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:15,241
No,

2349
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:15,601
but like,

2350
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:15,751
no,

2351
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:19,710
but like what you're saying is with
in this fan base that you have,

2352
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,940
there are people that,

2353
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,570
you know,

2354
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:22,770
hear stories and half truths.

2355
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:25,560
Do you remember the time when everyone
thought you really killed a mountain in

2356
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:26,130
with a belt?

2357
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:29,550
Nobody thought that it'd be so retarded
to think that then I guess I didn't

2358
01:04:29,551 --> 01:04:30,384
think it either.

2359
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,290
Did you think it,

2360
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:31,980
oh dude,

2361
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,000
there were a lot of people that are like,

2362
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:33,690
hey man,

2363
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:35,310
like tweeted me did Rogan really?

2364
01:04:35,311 --> 01:04:36,480
And there are people going,

2365
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:36,661
no,

2366
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:38,430
he didn't get tricked to tell you that.

2367
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:39,990
Who told who said it?

2368
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:40,770
Who said it?

2369
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:41,221
And do some,

2370
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:42,420
it was a parody website.

2371
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:43,860
It was like an onion type website.

2372
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:44,221
Oh it was.

2373
01:04:44,221 --> 01:04:45,210
But it got out there and like,

2374
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:45,571
I don't,

2375
01:04:45,571 --> 01:04:46,860
I didn't read the website but hold on,

2376
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:47,610
hold on,

2377
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:47,941
hold on.

2378
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:48,840
I didn't read the website,

2379
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,540
but you gotta be hammered
when you heard that story.

2380
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:52,350
Oh,

2381
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:52,970
there you go.

2382
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:55,800
Well it just sounds fake knowing Joe.

2383
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:58,190
It's like a mountain with a value.

2384
01:04:59,190 --> 01:04:59,550
How they,

2385
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:03,930
how the fuck would you get a belt around
a mountain lions neck fucking almost

2386
01:05:03,931 --> 01:05:04,764
texted you.

2387
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,680
My own sister asks me if it's true.

2388
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:10,920
No signs that you know,

2389
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:13,260
this kid that I know that gets bullied.

2390
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:16,440
And I told him the same thing
about like you should go online,

2391
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:20,320
take the boy's and like really just
throw all this fake stuff on there,

2392
01:05:20,321 --> 01:05:22,710
make fake websites about
them and ruin the Guy Online.

2393
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,110
That's like nowadays the best way to
get back at a bully like anonymous,

2394
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:27,341
we can,

2395
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:28,780
but I mean at the end of the day,

2396
01:05:28,781 --> 01:05:30,160
the bullies still the same guy.

2397
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,150
You're not really hurting them.

2398
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:31,601
You know,

2399
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:34,750
you're not changing anything by making
up a bunch of shit until the whole

2400
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:38,530
heights or the middle school sees these
websites and he's getting bullied for

2401
01:05:38,531 --> 01:05:38,951
being,

2402
01:05:38,951 --> 01:05:39,280
you know,

2403
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,740
I have pictures of him and
Leonardo Dicaprio Kissing.

2404
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:44,020
He should be laughing at
that unless he's an idiot.

2405
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,480
Do you think it looks real son?

2406
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:47,970
Thank you.

2407
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:48,760
Um,

2408
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,181
what does that,

2409
01:05:49,181 --> 01:05:50,014
uh,

2410
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,210
what does that a soda water?

2411
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:52,451
Yeah,

2412
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:52,821
it's clean.

2413
01:05:52,821 --> 01:05:53,654
Do you want something else?

2414
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,530
Sprite or something or soda?

2415
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:56,583
What's the best?

2416
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,431
I don't usually drink.

2417
01:05:57,431 --> 01:06:00,220
Vodka has flavor something.

2418
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:00,520
Okay.

2419
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:01,340
We'll give you some flavor.

2420
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,540
Brian and prediabetic.

2421
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:03,543
Yes.

2422
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:03,820
No,

2423
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:05,370
not Brian's prediabetic.

2424
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:06,680
Ooh.

2425
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,513
Ooh.

2426
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:08,230
Do you watch it?

2427
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:08,831
He said No.

2428
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:09,664
Brian said no.

2429
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,730
Do you watch a parascope when he
went on a website and he definitely,

2430
01:06:12,731 --> 01:06:13,564
he's not.

2431
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,130
He's telling me his eyes weren't
working correctly and I'm like,

2432
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:19,540
do you know that's a symptom of diabetes?

2433
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:20,350
I definitely don't have it.

2434
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:20,650
Like,

2435
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:21,310
okay,

2436
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,420
who you drank all the time.

2437
01:06:22,421 --> 01:06:23,254
You don't want your food.

2438
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:23,860
I was that good.

2439
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:24,693
Coconut water.

2440
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:25,360
Oh really?

2441
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,740
Did you get tested for diabetes?

2442
01:06:26,741 --> 01:06:27,011
Brian?

2443
01:06:27,011 --> 01:06:28,930
Are you just hoping to get tested?

2444
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:29,830
I got fully tested.

2445
01:06:29,831 --> 01:06:33,910
The only thing I had was a little
bit of a lack of vitamin D,

2446
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:36,600
which is I guess normal or being assigned.

2447
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:37,600
It's called being outside.

2448
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,430
That's the only thing you had.

2449
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:40,230
Yeah.

2450
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:40,990
You want one.

2451
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:44,870
Vitamin D is a a pretty normal
ailment or pretty normal?

2452
01:06:44,871 --> 01:06:47,160
I think there's jaundice.

2453
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,033
Is that what it is?

2454
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:48,490
Yeah.

2455
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:51,520
Well George and I both with jaundice and
you'd have to sit and hold them by the,

2456
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,413
by the sun,

2457
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,600
like by the window and let the sun hit
him and then you'd watch him turn from

2458
01:06:55,601 --> 01:06:56,291
yellow to white.

2459
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:57,130
I don't know if that's true.

2460
01:06:57,490 --> 01:06:59,950
I just remember hearing that
they turned from yellow to white.

2461
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:03,370
How bizarre is it that your body
produces a vitamin from the sun,

2462
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:08,170
like the sun hits you and it actually
produces vitamin D and I had a convertible

2463
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:10,720
and I live in Los Angeles
and I still was that.

2464
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,940
And it's like really need
to be actually out there,

2465
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,260
you know,

2466
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,520
we're very rarely like out in the sun.

2467
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:16,030
Right.

2468
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:19,900
What was the last time you were
sunburned without going to a tanning bed?

2469
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,440
That shit's not good either.

2470
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:24,160
Tanning beds.

2471
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,960
I have a friend who just got a,

2472
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,190
my friend Cameron Hanes,

2473
01:07:27,191 --> 01:07:29,110
he just got a big chunk
of his face cut off.

2474
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:29,740
Wow.

2475
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:30,670
Skin cancer.

2476
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:31,973
It's hard.

2477
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,780
I don't it start,

2478
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:36,010
was it like a weird mole on his face?

2479
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,370
I'm a Molly guy and it's
scary because like a half,

2480
01:07:39,371 --> 01:07:41,430
a lot of my moles look like they are,

2481
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:42,430
they should be cancer.

2482
01:07:42,431 --> 01:07:45,610
But then you get them checked and like
know if it turns red and starts to like

2483
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,230
hurt spread and stuff.

2484
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:49,901
Wait,

2485
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:50,141
wait til,

2486
01:07:50,141 --> 01:07:50,570
I'm sorry.

2487
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:51,231
Tell me about camera.

2488
01:07:51,231 --> 01:07:52,070
I'm more interested in cameras.

2489
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,470
Weird the on his face.

2490
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:53,831
And,

2491
01:07:53,831 --> 01:07:54,040
uh,

2492
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,170
I went to the doctor and they,

2493
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,290
they check it and I'm like,

2494
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:56,810
Yep,

2495
01:07:56,810 --> 01:07:57,730
you gotta cut it out.

2496
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:58,680
They make an appointment late.

2497
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,030
They sliced them like a box cutter.

2498
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:03,370
Like he was in a war with the gang banger,

2499
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,650
cut his face open and stitched it back up.

2500
01:08:05,651 --> 01:08:07,270
They took a big chunk out of his face,

2501
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,640
but his camera and use
sunscreen when he goes hunting.

2502
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,020
Um,

2503
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:11,770
no,

2504
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:12,603
I don't think so.

2505
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:13,280
It probably doesn't.

2506
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,290
Money runs either.

2507
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:15,291
He runs a lot.

2508
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:15,861
He's a police,

2509
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:16,190
right?

2510
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:16,371
Yeah,

2511
01:08:16,371 --> 01:08:16,880
he's,

2512
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:17,421
he's doing,

2513
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:18,820
he's getting ready now for,

2514
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,360
uh,

2515
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,080
a double ultra marathon.

2516
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,240
It's something called the big foot race.

2517
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:25,100
It's 200 plus miles,

2518
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:26,900
I think it's 204 miles.

2519
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:27,590
No.

2520
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:27,950
Yup.

2521
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:28,660
It's two days.

2522
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:29,480
Two days.

2523
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:29,970
These guys were,

2524
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:30,651
why the sound guy?

2525
01:08:30,651 --> 01:08:32,930
That was James Deamer who does,

2526
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:33,500
uh,

2527
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,610
who does those ultra marathons?

2528
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:35,930
Cam's done a bunch,

2529
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:36,411
well,

2530
01:08:36,411 --> 01:08:37,130
not a bunch.

2531
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,240
He's done a bunch of marathons,

2532
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:42,860
but I think he's done three
100 mile runs and one of them,

2533
01:08:42,861 --> 01:08:47,600
he actually did a 24 hour
race and he won 106 miles.

2534
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,520
I think it was something like that.

2535
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:50,354
Something crazy like that.

2536
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,750
106 and a now he's going
to essentially double that

2537
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,003
or close to it.

2538
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:56,450
That's fucking insane.

2539
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,200
Yeah,

2540
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:57,951
but you don't know what it was.

2541
01:08:57,951 --> 01:09:01,820
I'll say this guy's like Cameron and uh,

2542
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,890
who's the guy who had the
children travel general for,

2543
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:04,790
can't remember his name right now,

2544
01:09:04,791 --> 01:09:07,700
but it's a good friend of yours
is also Steven Nelson Mandela.

2545
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,350
They've made hunting.

2546
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:10,070
Uh,

2547
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:10,431
cool.

2548
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:10,910
Again.

2549
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:11,360
Yeah.

2550
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,100
Like I like the,

2551
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,840
I listen to those stories
and it's hunting's you know,

2552
01:09:14,841 --> 01:09:15,710
when I was a kid,

2553
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:19,430
hunting was about like waking up
early and going out with your dad and,

2554
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:24,470
and fucking being tired and cold in the
car and then going out and then possibly

2555
01:09:24,471 --> 01:09:27,290
someone would hit you with buck
shot like at some point in the day.

2556
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,540
But like now it's like,

2557
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:29,800
it's,

2558
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,100
it seems like these adventures,

2559
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:31,331
which,

2560
01:09:31,331 --> 01:09:32,780
which almost as a man,

2561
01:09:32,781 --> 01:09:34,280
like my wife got chickens and,

2562
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:38,780
and I understand she's never been more
happy about a project in her life and she

2563
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:39,080
met.

2564
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,010
Got It from your wife.

2565
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:41,143
When we went to your house,

2566
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:43,670
she saw that she thought
it was so fucking cool.

2567
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:44,840
She had been talking about forever.

2568
01:09:44,841 --> 01:09:47,390
Finally gets the chickens every
morning she let the chickens out,

2569
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:48,403
she talks to them,

2570
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:49,101
she's trained them.

2571
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,930
So they'll come up and get on her and,

2572
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,920
and I watched that.

2573
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:55,580
And it's a primal instinct that's
inherent in humans is to almost,

2574
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,540
I want to,

2575
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,020
I want to,

2576
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,370
I want to plow my own field.

2577
01:09:58,371 --> 01:09:58,820
I want to,

2578
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,990
I want to do my own work.

2579
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:04,840
I don't have to feel like I did
something and those guys want to,

2580
01:10:04,841 --> 01:10:05,641
and when I listen to you,

2581
01:10:05,641 --> 01:10:06,800
I'll do podcasts about it.

2582
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,590
I get it makes me want to go hunting.

2583
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,030
And I told you I'd never kill an animal.

2584
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:11,960
I'm never,

2585
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:13,100
I don't know if I'd be cool with it.

2586
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:15,470
I don't know that I'd have
killed a couple animals.

2587
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:15,981
I take that back.

2588
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:18,620
But I had a pig roast and house and kill,

2589
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:21,680
killed animals are definitely killed
animals but never like no with a shotgun

2590
01:10:21,681 --> 01:10:22,460
now with the gun.

2591
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,300
Never the bone arrow.

2592
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,820
But it makes it seem like,

2593
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:26,890
hey man,

2594
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:28,190
I might need this in my life.

2595
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,540
That sounds so fucking stupid,

2596
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:33,540
but I might need this in my life to get
out into nature with me and a gun and,

2597
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,780
and be afraid because
you're in the jungle,

2598
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:38,240
you're in the woods and a
bear might roll up on you.

2599
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:42,020
What you are out there to hunt
might roll up on you and get,

2600
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:43,940
it's like this fight club,

2601
01:10:43,941 --> 01:10:46,010
cut your fingernails cause
you're fighting type thing.

2602
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:46,610
And,

2603
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:50,630
and I like I just started going back
out to that place we shot shotguns and

2604
01:10:50,631 --> 01:10:52,940
shooting sporting clays cause I was like,

2605
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:54,021
I was like,

2606
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:54,290
man,

2607
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:55,040
maybe this,

2608
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:55,873
maybe this will,

2609
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:59,450
maybe this will be like a new form of
therapy or maybe this'll be like a new

2610
01:10:59,451 --> 01:11:02,990
thing that blossoms into me growing.

2611
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,610
Does that make any sense?

2612
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:06,081
It does make sense.

2613
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:08,320
Like the shotgun that what you were,

2614
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,620
the way you were explaining it.

2615
01:11:09,621 --> 01:11:11,450
I've never done that sporting clay stuff,

2616
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:12,980
but it sounds really fun.

2617
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:13,230
Yeah.

2618
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:14,190
That what it is

2619
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:14,371
is,

2620
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:14,670
uh,

2621
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,540
well you can explain it,

2622
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:18,690
but you go out there and there's a course
and all these things pop up and you

2623
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,500
shoot him,

2624
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,070
but you,

2625
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:22,470
you're going through this course and
as you're going through this course,

2626
01:11:22,471 --> 01:11:24,090
some of them are rolling on the ground.

2627
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,650
Some of them they shoot up,

2628
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,200
they launch them in the air
and they're these clays,

2629
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:29,820
just like those same sorts of things,

2630
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:30,061
right?

2631
01:11:30,061 --> 01:11:30,481
Like those,

2632
01:11:30,481 --> 01:11:31,500
those 50th,

2633
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:31,840
yeah,

2634
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,140
it's 15 different stations that you go to.

2635
01:11:34,141 --> 01:11:36,930
You can go to 15 dissertations and
they're all set up differently to be

2636
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:38,010
different types of birds,

2637
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:39,030
different types of animals.

2638
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:42,570
So like some will be like a rabbit where
the clay roles on the ground out in

2639
01:11:42,571 --> 01:11:42,811
front of,

2640
01:11:42,811 --> 01:11:44,340
but you don't the real,

2641
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:45,780
the real sport in it.

2642
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:46,710
And I gotta be honest with you,

2643
01:11:46,711 --> 01:11:47,544
it's,

2644
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:48,001
it's like,

2645
01:11:48,001 --> 01:11:48,720
uh,

2646
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,000
it's like fine tuning your
machine where you get up there,

2647
01:11:51,001 --> 01:11:51,834
you have your gun,

2648
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:53,940
your shotgun and a,

2649
01:11:53,941 --> 01:11:55,500
we did the two shot,

2650
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,590
top and bottom right.

2651
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:02,340
And you out there and you go pull and
your buddy hits the button behind you.

2652
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:05,940
And all of a sudden two things come out
of the woods and you don't know where

2653
01:12:05,941 --> 01:12:09,390
the common from and you don't know where
and you just feel like fuck just and

2654
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:12,780
you try to get it and then there is this
thing that hits on your head and hits

2655
01:12:12,781 --> 01:12:14,030
in your fucking cerebellum.

2656
01:12:14,031 --> 01:12:14,121
We,

2657
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:14,954
you're like,

2658
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,410
I couldn't feed my family today.

2659
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:17,611
Like you get done.

2660
01:12:17,611 --> 01:12:17,910
You're like,

2661
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:19,290
I couldn't find my family that day.

2662
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,000
I'm trying to defend myself or my family.

2663
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,410
I'd be back in the woods tomorrow.

2664
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:23,070
And,

2665
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:23,903
and it was,

2666
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:24,700
it's cool man.

2667
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:25,533
I,

2668
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:28,860
I wish I could remember the name of
the place to say it so people would go

2669
01:12:28,861 --> 01:12:29,694
there,

2670
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,680
but it was fucking packed.

2671
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:32,371
But the day we went,

2672
01:12:32,371 --> 01:12:33,204
someone setting,

2673
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,500
I posted a video on my youtube page cause
we were walking doing the walk and a

2674
01:12:37,501 --> 01:12:41,450
deer just walked across us and we've
fucking shotguns and it tears just walked

2675
01:12:41,451 --> 01:12:41,640
across.

2676
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,120
I go,

2677
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,050
we can fucking kill it.

2678
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:44,850
Like we have loaded shotguns,

2679
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:46,920
but we're tuning sporting
clays and we're like,

2680
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:47,961
what the fuck?

2681
01:12:47,961 --> 01:12:49,470
You might not really even kill it.

2682
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:49,920
You wouldn't even,

2683
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,000
you just fuck up a tide.

2684
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:52,090
You have heard of the evening.

2685
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,670
We heard it pretty bad because you're,

2686
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:54,181
you're,

2687
01:12:54,181 --> 01:12:57,660
you're shooting spray
those little tiny pellets.

2688
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:58,920
He would need a slug.

2689
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:00,810
Like they use slugs to hunt deer.

2690
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,261
Well that's the,

2691
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:02,070
with a shotgun.

2692
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:05,880
That's the one thing about that video is
I posted and I was like hunters and uh,

2693
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,730
anti gun people will both hate
this video cause hunters were like,

2694
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,720
you couldn't fucking kill it.

2695
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:10,250
Right.

2696
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:10,840
And Go,

2697
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:11,131
people are like,

2698
01:13:11,131 --> 01:13:11,410
how are you,

2699
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:12,270
why do you have guns?

2700
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:14,220
So I'm like right in
that window of stupid.

2701
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,193
Well,

2702
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,530
what's going on is when you're out there
and those things are running by like

2703
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:22,080
your focused folks
forced to focus on them.

2704
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,380
And when you forced to focus on the
clay rolling on the ground or the one

2705
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:26,370
launching through the air,

2706
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,770
it takes you away from your pro,

2707
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:29,040
your problems and your troubles.

2708
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:32,820
It takes you away from thinking about
all the other things that are going on in

2709
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:34,140
the back of your brain constantly,

2710
01:13:34,141 --> 01:13:37,890
whether it's bills or stress or a
schedule or did you try it on the road?

2711
01:13:37,891 --> 01:13:38,430
Yeah.

2712
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:38,641
I mean,

2713
01:13:38,641 --> 01:13:40,210
you're constantly doing things and you,

2714
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:44,370
you have all these obligations and all
these people tugging at you all the time,

2715
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:44,910
dude.

2716
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:46,710
And it just happens the
second you get kids,

2717
01:13:46,711 --> 01:13:47,910
you commit to all that shit.

2718
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:48,720
It's like,

2719
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,620
it's like growing up,

2720
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:49,890
I,

2721
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:52,080
I talked to my therapist
about it and he was like,

2722
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,460
it's like when did your stress start?

2723
01:13:53,461 --> 01:13:55,680
Like when did you start really caring,

2724
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:56,940
giving a fuck?

2725
01:13:57,210 --> 01:13:58,590
I finally give a fuck when I had kids.

2726
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,030
And then you go out
hunting and you're like,

2727
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:00,571
I don't know.

2728
01:14:00,571 --> 01:14:01,020
I don't know.

2729
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,010
It takes you back to,

2730
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:03,600
it takes me by society.

2731
01:14:03,601 --> 01:14:06,870
Fucks up what being a man is about so
much and make you overthink it and not let

2732
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:07,321
you be it.

2733
01:14:07,321 --> 01:14:08,700
And sometimes when you're a man,

2734
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:09,660
it's fucking,

2735
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,500
someone called me a
bro Comic and I'm like,

2736
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:11,691
Dad,

2737
01:14:11,691 --> 01:14:13,150
I'm just a fucking person.

2738
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:15,520
I happen to have a perspective
cause I have a dick.

2739
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:16,630
And if that's my perspective,

2740
01:14:16,631 --> 01:14:17,381
call me Bro Comic.

2741
01:14:17,381 --> 01:14:18,214
That's fine.

2742
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,053
But like,

2743
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,013
but like,

2744
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:20,740
uh,

2745
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,010
I don't even know what
the fuck I was sets.

2746
01:14:22,011 --> 01:14:23,380
It's a weird pejorative.

2747
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:24,580
That robe pejorative.

2748
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:25,211
It's so funny.

2749
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:26,530
People love using it.

2750
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:28,570
He said dismiss anything
that anybody says.

2751
01:14:28,571 --> 01:14:29,080
Yeah.

2752
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,150
If you're into manly type activities,

2753
01:14:31,151 --> 01:14:32,590
you have to be a bro.

2754
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:34,930
Like he should be ashamed of your gender.

2755
01:14:34,931 --> 01:14:35,261
Bert.

2756
01:14:35,261 --> 01:14:37,750
Kreischer I fucking love MMA.

2757
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:40,630
I get kicked out of bars
when Conor McGregor wins.

2758
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,673
Like

2759
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,780
I got kicked out of a fucking be fucking
buffalo wild wings got kicked out of

2760
01:14:46,781 --> 01:14:48,400
Buffalo Wings twice this year.

2761
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:50,260
Why Buffalo Wild Wings,

2762
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:55,240
Conor Mcgregor's when I got kicked out
and I got kicked out in Utah because I

2763
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,890
was standing up and drinking a beer.

2764
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,751
Wow.

2765
01:14:58,751 --> 01:14:59,201
Hold on.

2766
01:14:59,201 --> 01:15:02,380
Let's go to the economy McGregor one
first and then we'll visit the Utah one

2767
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,060
because I need to know about this.

2768
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:05,800
So you're watching the UFC,

2769
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,270
they're playing it in the bar.

2770
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:07,840
Yeah.

2771
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,380
So when you're playing the UFC
is like anytime you're there,

2772
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:12,220
you've been the one line,

2773
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,440
I'm going to jump ahead
of you for two seconds.

2774
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:18,940
There is next to our next
to us is a man and his wife,

2775
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:19,150

two year old child
watching this fight in uh,

2779
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,333
Ohio.

2780
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,470
So whatever time it
happened where you were at,

2781
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:30,251
its mind you,

2782
01:15:30,251 --> 01:15:31,084
it's Ohio.

2783
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,110
So it's like probably like 10 yeah,

2784
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:34,960
10 at night.

2785
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,280
I'm going to say I'm gonna Probably
say 11 by the time Macgregor got on on.

2786
01:15:38,281 --> 01:15:38,661
Okay.

2787
01:15:38,661 --> 01:15:39,520
You watched the main event,

2788
01:15:39,521 --> 01:15:39,701
right?

2789
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:40,050
Yeah,

2790
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:41,290
I'm watching all the fights,

2791
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:42,300
but Conor McGregor,

2792
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:43,163
two hour,

2793
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,153
three hour difference.

2794
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:45,350
Oh,

2795
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:46,630
that's even later than that then.

2796
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:47,410
Yeah.

2797
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:47,950
Okay.

2798
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:49,750
So there's a child on it with an IPAD,

2799
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:50,733
right?

2800
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:53,740
So it's probably like 12 it's probably
like midnight and there's a child there.

2801
01:15:53,741 --> 01:15:54,431
So we're watching,

2802
01:15:54,431 --> 01:15:55,510
I bring my whole crew out,

2803
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:57,160
we're on the road and I'm like,

2804
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,800
this is the one thing that makes
you sane on the road is like,

2805
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:01,340
one thing that makes you really Kinda,

2806
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:01,991
I made,

2807
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:04,210
makes me touch into life
is like you're on the road,

2808
01:16:04,211 --> 01:16:04,581
you're working.

2809
01:16:04,581 --> 01:16:05,740
And then my cameraman,

2810
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:06,790
John Man's would always be like,

2811
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:07,390
hey,

2812
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:08,223
UFC is on tonight.

2813
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:08,531
Come on.

2814
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:09,364
We gotta go watch Rogan.

2815
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:09,970
And like,

2816
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:10,601
so my whole crew,

2817
01:16:10,601 --> 01:16:11,081
we'll go out,

2818
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:12,010
we'll go to buffalo wild wings.

2819
01:16:12,011 --> 01:16:14,080
They always show it
and we'll all watch it.

2820
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:17,170
And when you comment like one of the fun
things like you know people that don't

2821
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:17,321
know,

2822
01:16:17,321 --> 01:16:17,740
they're like,

2823
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:18,580
you know that guy?

2824
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:18,971
And I'm like,

2825
01:16:18,971 --> 01:16:19,660
yeah,

2826
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:20,060
it's,

2827
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:20,690
it's,

2828
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:22,420
but it's a connection to
life where you're like,

2829
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:23,320
I'm lost on the road.

2830
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:24,850
And then you hear a friend
on TV and you're like,

2831
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,240
I'm back in and this is the shit I like
and more men and we're watching UFC.

2832
01:16:28,241 --> 01:16:30,670
Conor McGregor is fucking
losing that fight.

2833
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:32,330
It looks like he's losing that fight.

2834
01:16:32,331 --> 01:16:35,620
And the last minute he comes in and I've
been cheering from the whole fucking

2835
01:16:35,621 --> 01:16:39,220
time and everyone Ohio hates his mother
fucker and I am cheering from the whole

2836
01:16:39,221 --> 01:16:40,870
time cause he's a precious Irish saint.

2837
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:43,240
And the second he knocks him out or
fucking takes him down or whatever,

2838
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,080
we ended it.

2839
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,850
Shirt comes off and I'm like,

2840
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:46,893
that's what's up.

2841
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:48,543
That's what's up.

2842
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:53,570
And that's against the licensed
they have for serving food,

2843
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,050
having no shirt on,

2844
01:16:55,820 --> 01:17:00,620
take your clothes off in a fine
dining establishment was guilty.

2845
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:06,460
Describe Conor Mcgregor and an
angel or something precious Irish,

2846
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:07,150
saint.

2847
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:07,631
Precious.

2848
01:17:07,631 --> 01:17:09,070
We don't get many of those yet.

2849
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:09,973
Ricky Patton,

2850
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,740
you get Conor McGregor hat
and whatever his name was.

2851
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:14,090
Joseph Dick Van Patten.

2852
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,230
Dig back back.

2853
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,293
Parents Steam.

2854
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,890
We fucking love those guys,

2855
01:17:21,891 --> 01:17:22,230
man.

2856
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:25,310
They're there are fucking
the guys we have to go see.

2857
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:26,360
Told you were not that bad.

2858
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,560
That's funny.

2859
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:28,640
That's hilarious.

2860
01:17:28,641 --> 01:17:31,970
But the shirt coming off get you kicked
out so they grab you and the guy grabs

2861
01:17:31,971 --> 01:17:32,451
me and he goes,

2862
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:33,170
hey,

2863
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:35,930
you can't take your shirt
off in a buffalo wild wings.

2864
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:36,411
And I go,

2865
01:17:36,411 --> 01:17:37,111
I'll put it back on.

2866
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:37,640
And he goes,

2867
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,121
and then he goes,

2868
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:39,170
there's a child here.

2869
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:39,471
I go,

2870
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:39,831
hold on.

2871
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:40,670
Don't use that defense.

2872
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:43,880
We're watching a fucking
blood sport on TV.

2873
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:46,250
The child's been watching
tonight to shirtless guys.

2874
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:49,940
Don't fucking light me up for
being the fucking start with them.

2875
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:50,930
Kicked out with the kid out.

2876
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:51,231
Dang.

2877
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,064
Kick me out.

2878
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:53,420
So I got kicked out of that one.

2879
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,160
What if the kid's gangster
and likes fighting?

2880
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:56,960
He wouldn't even watch these
on an iPad the whole time.

2881
01:17:56,961 --> 01:17:58,520
Maybe one day we'll do like,

2882
01:17:58,521 --> 01:17:59,660
we'll take it in peripherally.

2883
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:00,523
Yeah,

2884
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:01,640
like roar of the crowd.

2885
01:18:01,641 --> 01:18:02,930
I want to inspire them,

2886
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:04,430
father.

2887
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,800
So should me to fight
the most ridiculous ones.

2888
01:18:06,801 --> 01:18:07,850
Buffalo wild wings.

2889
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:10,700
I'm standing up having a
beer guy comes up to me.

2890
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:10,940
He's like,

2891
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:11,660
man,

2892
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,441
I can't have you doing that.

2893
01:18:12,441 --> 01:18:13,310
I need you to sit down.

2894
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:14,450
I didn't realize,

2895
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:18,590
I didn't realize you can't stand and have
a beer in Utah that's illegal to stand

2896
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,640
and drink a beer.

2897
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,740
So when you go to a bar and
you taught everyone seated,

2898
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:23,110
you have to be seated and you have a,

2899
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,080
you can't be walking around.

2900
01:18:24,081 --> 01:18:25,970
You can be like standing
and standing at a bar.

2901
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:26,841
So you can't like,

2902
01:18:26,841 --> 01:18:27,021
you know,

2903
01:18:27,021 --> 01:18:29,420
people go to a bar and they mingle
and they walk around with their beer.

2904
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,230
You sit down,

2905
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:30,611
if you,

2906
01:18:30,611 --> 01:18:31,400
if you want to stand up,

2907
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,233
if you want to stand up,

2908
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:32,881
you got to have no,

2909
01:18:32,881 --> 01:18:33,570
no beer in hand.

2910
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:34,400
Crazy.

2911
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,720
They used to be a rule that we thought
for the longest time at the Tempe Improv

2912
01:18:38,721 --> 01:18:40,340
that you weren't allowed
to drink on stage,

2913
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:42,290
but it turned out was bullshit.

2914
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:44,030
Denmark,

2915
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:45,140
may he rest in peace.

2916
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:46,080
Uh,

2917
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:46,731
Dan Mar,

2918
01:18:46,731 --> 01:18:47,564
he's dead,

2919
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:48,620
uh,

2920
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:53,300
was decided for whatever reason that
he was going to put up a fake sign that

2921
01:18:53,301 --> 01:18:56,360
there's a fake state law that
says you can't drink on stage.

2922
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,470
And so we would,

2923
01:18:57,470 --> 01:18:59,060
we would just bring flasks.

2924
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,440
When Brian and I were there,

2925
01:19:00,441 --> 01:19:01,370
we went to a,

2926
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,440
like a drive Thru BU's place,

2927
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:04,640
which is hilarious.

2928
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:09,540
Bought a flask full of flask and a
bottle of Jack and then we're drinking on

2929
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:10,160
stage.

2930
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,300
I was just adding,

2931
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,560
I was explaining,

2932
01:19:12,561 --> 01:19:16,910
I was adding warm diet coke to my
cold diet coke because I like to,

2933
01:19:16,911 --> 01:19:19,250
I like a medium temperature.

2934
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,600
So I have a flask of warm diet
coke to always keep with him.

2935
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:23,720
By the way,

2936
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,700
I'm already on top of
that lie to whoever asks,

2937
01:19:25,701 --> 01:19:27,830
because I'm such a drinker
in public like you are like,

2938
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:28,281
cause I like,

2939
01:19:28,281 --> 01:19:29,150
and I was already going,

2940
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,310
what's my line real quick
cause my teeth get too cold.

2941
01:19:31,311 --> 01:19:32,180
I don't want my teeth to get cold.

2942
01:19:32,181 --> 01:19:33,200
I just had oral surgery.

2943
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,460
That's a good way to look at it.

2944
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:36,800
So in Utah,

2945
01:19:36,801 --> 01:19:37,610
is that True Brian?

2946
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:37,911
You can't,

2947
01:19:37,911 --> 01:19:39,170
doesn't say anything about that.

2948
01:19:39,171 --> 01:19:42,170
But it does say a lot of
weird things about Utah.

2949
01:19:42,171 --> 01:19:46,010
Any beer over 4% eight
BV is considered liquor.

2950
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:47,000
Alcohol by volume.

2951
01:19:47,001 --> 01:19:47,620
Yeah.

2952
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:50,870
And when they have Zions
curtain there Zions curtain is,

2953
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:52,003
is the,

2954
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:52,481
they have it.

2955
01:19:52,481 --> 01:19:53,720
They won't pour your
drink in front of you.

2956
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,790
And so yeah,

2957
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,910
they weren't see the bartender there
were just mixing or pouring drinks.

2958
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:00,020
They used to have it.

2959
01:20:00,021 --> 01:20:04,220
So you would buy like your drink in one
spot and your mixer and another spot.

2960
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,530
Like if you wanted a
jack and coke they would,

2961
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:06,930
they would,

2962
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:08,070
you have the poor,

2963
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,710
the Jack Daniels and the glass in one
spot and then you have to go over and get

2964
01:20:10,711 --> 01:20:11,850
the coke and another spot.

2965
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:12,270
Wow.

2966
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,890
Oh I got another part of the bar.

2967
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,150
This also says that you could only have
1.5 ounces of alcohol and your drink no

2968
01:20:18,151 --> 01:20:18,691
exception.

2969
01:20:18,691 --> 01:20:21,600
So like a long island ice tea
would be like the worst drink ever.

2970
01:20:21,601 --> 01:20:23,820
And the ones that actually
you can actually all sugar.

2971
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:24,181
Hold on,

2972
01:20:24,181 --> 01:20:25,910
you can actually get along us honesty.

2973
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:31,350
That's the exception in Utah because I
had ordered a double Tito's and soda and

2974
01:20:31,351 --> 01:20:31,531
they said,

2975
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:32,364
we can't do doubles.

2976
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:35,370
We can bring you to drinks or we'll
know that we can bring you a drink and a

2977
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:36,204
shot,

2978
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:37,590
but we can't do two drinks.

2979
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:39,210
They can't order doubles.

2980
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:40,703
Doubles.

2981
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:41,390
Dude,

2982
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:41,590
you,

2983
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:46,530
you should've seen the look on my face
as we're watching UFC in a buffalo wild

2984
01:20:46,531 --> 01:20:47,160
wings.

2985
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,630
And the bartender says to me,

2986
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:49,051
uh,

2987
01:20:49,051 --> 01:20:50,430
the manager comes up,

2988
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:54,240
I wish I knew where we were in
Utah because it's a smaller,

2989
01:20:54,241 --> 01:20:54,570
it's an,

2990
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:55,100
it's not one,

2991
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,810
it's not Provo or it's
one of the smaller towns.

2992
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:59,820
So it's not like the big city,

2993
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:02,850
which I'm sure you're allowed to stand
up and with your beer in your hand at

2994
01:21:02,851 --> 01:21:03,684
times.

2995
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,500
But like,

2996
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,790
but like he came up to me,

2997
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:07,560
I had gone to the bathroom
with my beer in my hand.

2998
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:10,860
Who leaves a beer on the fucking
bar and walks to the bathroom.

2999
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,270
You'd have to be crazy.

3000
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:12,540
Yeah,

3001
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:13,110
I bring,

3002
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:13,700
I walked,

3003
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,090
I didn't even think anything of it.

3004
01:21:15,091 --> 01:21:17,670
It sounds ridiculous now just walk
to the bar with my beer in my hand.

3005
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,690
Take a piss and come back.

3006
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:19,051
And he was,

3007
01:21:19,051 --> 01:21:19,650
hey man,

3008
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,430
hey man,

3009
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:21,240
uh,

3010
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,500
I can't have you walking around with that.

3011
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,011
And I was like,

3012
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:23,520
um,

3013
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,031
excuse me.

3014
01:21:24,031 --> 01:21:24,261
He was like,

3015
01:21:24,261 --> 01:21:24,450
yeah,

3016
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:25,620
I don't want you to walk
around with that beer.

3017
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:26,040
That's,

3018
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,150
do you need to sit down?

3019
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:28,020
And I was like,

3020
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:28,321
sure,

3021
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:28,471
sure,

3022
01:21:28,471 --> 01:21:29,250
sure.

3023
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:29,910
And then I was like,

3024
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:32,300
this is a white guy voice
or a black guy was like,

3025
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:33,360
I should have said he was white.

3026
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,193
All my stories,

3027
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,850
there was this white guy comes up,

3028
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:38,641
he was going to be what?

3029
01:21:38,641 --> 01:21:39,450
Because he fucking was.

3030
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:40,520
And so I,

3031
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,150
I'm sitting there drinking my beer,

3032
01:21:42,151 --> 01:21:44,400
but I'm watching watching UFC.

3033
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:45,293
So I'm standing up,

3034
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:45,631
right,

3035
01:21:45,631 --> 01:21:46,650
like going through the moves.

3036
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,570
It's kidding.

3037
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:48,931
I'm kidding.

3038
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:49,291
I did what?

3039
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:50,124
I was standing up.

3040
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,570
I'm standing up and I,

3041
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:55,410
I'm drinking my beer and the guy comes
up to me again in lights me up and I go

3042
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:56,640
and now I'm confused.

3043
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:57,600
But I'm also drunk.

3044
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,340
So like I take a berry,

3045
01:21:59,341 --> 01:22:02,130
like guilty drunk perspective ever.

3046
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:04,950
Anyone on a plane ever says anything
to me about anything drinking.

3047
01:22:04,951 --> 01:22:05,220
I go,

3048
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:05,311
Oh,

3049
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:06,000
I'm sorry I'm done.

3050
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:06,570
I'm done.

3051
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:07,081
Like I'm never,

3052
01:22:07,081 --> 01:22:07,914
I'm not that company.

3053
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,090
How many times does that happen?

3054
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:12,510
How could Joseph like fucking 3
million miles and he hates flying.

3055
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,353
Say gets drunk.

3056
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,590
People complain a lot about
you drinking on planes.

3057
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:16,861
Yeah.

3058
01:22:16,861 --> 01:22:18,830
If you drink on planes at four beers,

3059
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:19,980
someone will say something to you.

3060
01:22:19,981 --> 01:22:20,131
Yeah.

3061
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:21,030
What did he say to you?

3062
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:21,720
Eh,

3063
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:21,940
Eh,

3064
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:22,740
had a lot.

3065
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:23,573
Who says this?

3066
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:24,610
The weight flight attendant.

3067
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:28,220
So I've given you four.

3068
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:32,530
This isn't a 30 minute flight
and I'm giving you for it.

3069
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,160
You know,

3070
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:33,751
I w I,

3071
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:34,230
you know,

3072
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:35,063
I think we've had a lot.

3073
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:35,611
Then you just go,

3074
01:22:35,611 --> 01:22:36,000
oh,

3075
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,751
I automatically,

3076
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:36,901
I'm like,

3077
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:37,710
I'm so sorry.

3078
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:38,311
I totally fine.

3079
01:22:38,311 --> 01:22:38,791
Don't worry about it.

3080
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:41,610
And then I fucking white knuckle the rest
of the flight because I can't because

3081
01:22:41,611 --> 01:22:42,120
I get nervous.

3082
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:42,953
Fine.

3083
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,140
I had a guy on the plane to South Africa
telling me I've had a lot and I was

3084
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:46,320
like,

3085
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:46,921
I pulled him aside.

3086
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:47,310
I was like,

3087
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:49,230
I'm totally sober right now,

3088
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:52,470
but we need to figure out a way where
I can drink the rest of this flight

3089
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:56,280
because I will have panic because
I had 13 hours left and I was like,

3090
01:22:56,281 --> 01:22:58,020
so you come up with a system,

3091
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:58,883
I'll agree with it.

3092
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:00,390
And the guy looked at
me very plainly is like,

3093
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:02,730
I'll give you a beer every
hour for the next 13 hours.

3094
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:03,031
I was like,

3095
01:23:03,031 --> 01:23:03,391
perfect.

3096
01:23:03,391 --> 01:23:04,670
She's just crying.

3097
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:05,793
And I was like,

3098
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:07,350
13 beers on flight.

3099
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:07,991
Uh,

3100
01:23:07,991 --> 01:23:08,490
we'll,

3101
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:09,071
we're going to be honest.

3102
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:09,904
Are we going to lie?

3103
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:10,893
Let's be honest,

3104
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:12,520
we nibble a little
Xanax and went to sleep.

3105
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:16,510
So I nibble a little Xanax and then
had the next beer and then fucking,

3106
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:18,100
I don't think you're
supposed to mix those.

3107
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:18,821
I know Joe.

3108
01:23:18,821 --> 01:23:19,750
That's why I was going to lie to Ya.

3109
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,030
Fucking reason.

3110
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,670
I lie sometimes there was
a lady on a plane once,

3111
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:25,451
I'll never forget her.

3112
01:23:25,451 --> 01:23:29,740
She was talking about how the grants
have a Xanax and a glass of wine,

3113
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:31,940
just a Xanax and glass of wine.

3114
01:23:31,941 --> 01:23:34,380
And she's looking at me like
right at Xanax and I got,

3115
01:23:34,381 --> 01:23:35,470
I'm like dangerous.

3116
01:23:35,730 --> 01:23:36,490
No,

3117
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:38,920
it's dangerous for how Geraldo,

3118
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:40,210
what else is the Xanax?

3119
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,030
Really?

3120
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:41,863
Ah,

3121
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,150
why would you ever listen to me?

3122
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:43,984
But yeah.

3123
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:45,220
Are you sure?

3124
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,280
Oh Ho I'm a hundred percent sure.

3125
01:23:48,281 --> 01:23:52,240
In the same way Doug Stanhope is
who I go to when I have problems.

3126
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:52,630
Like,

3127
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:54,850
like look when when he led your died,

3128
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,320
both Stan hope and I both were on
the like on the Internet going like,

3129
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,250
hold on.

3130
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:00,971
What was the,

3131
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:02,140
how much ambient did he happened?

3132
01:24:02,141 --> 01:24:03,340
How much Xanax did he have?

3133
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:03,850
Cause these,

3134
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:06,880
these are real for people who take Xanax.

3135
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:07,481
You need to know.

3136
01:24:07,481 --> 01:24:08,560
But from what I understand,

3137
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:09,743
um,

3138
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:10,833
Greg,

3139
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:11,920
I hate,

3140
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:14,500
I don't even know how to talk like this
because I liked Greg a lot and I don't

3141
01:24:14,501 --> 01:24:18,060
want to tell Google what
Greg draw the died off.

3142
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:20,560
It was toxicology reports going
to be a little bit of everything.

3143
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:23,620
I'm certain because I think
he was partying at the time
when he definitely liked

3144
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,573
pills.

3145
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:25,570
He had an issue.

3146
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:26,560
Uh,

3147
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,071
I think I,

3148
01:24:27,071 --> 01:24:27,360
yeah.

3149
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:27,720
Yeah.

3150
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,360
I feel we were talking about Greg.

3151
01:24:29,361 --> 01:24:31,270
So I really genuine liked him
and he was very sweet to me.

3152
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:31,990
He's a great guy.

3153
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,771
He was like fantastic.

3154
01:24:32,771 --> 01:24:35,290
Doesn't it take away from the fact
that he had an issue with pills?

3155
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,080
He definitely need.

3156
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,030
He wasn't a great guy.

3157
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:37,361
I know,

3158
01:24:37,361 --> 01:24:38,470
but I still have great people.

3159
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:39,640
If issues of pills,

3160
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:43,180
I say this then as a warning and
using Greg's legacy is a warning.

3161
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,550
It's not a bad thing to say it killed him.

3162
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:46,401
I mean it's,

3163
01:24:46,401 --> 01:24:46,990
it's a good,

3164
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:47,141
it's,

3165
01:24:47,141 --> 01:24:48,340
I think it's a good thing to bring up.

3166
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:48,830
He,

3167
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:49,270
yeah,

3168
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:49,570
yeah.

3169
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:49,870
Yeah.

3170
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:50,561
But I'll tell you what,

3171
01:24:50,561 --> 01:24:53,140
the whole reason I don't
fuck with Xanax at all.

3172
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:53,993
It's because of Greg,

3173
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,990
because from what I understand,

3174
01:24:56,110 --> 01:24:56,860
he was coming,

3175
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:57,581
from what I understand,

3176
01:24:57,581 --> 01:24:58,560
he was coming off partying.

3177
01:24:58,750 --> 01:24:59,680
He was in a hotel room,

3178
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:00,850
he wanted to sleep.

3179
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:02,550
He took Xanax and he,

3180
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:04,900
and with Xanax sometimes,

3181
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:05,441
uh,

3182
01:25:05,441 --> 01:25:06,274
when you use it,

3183
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:06,790
and I,

3184
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:08,470
I've used it a bunch in the past,

3185
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:09,673
um,

3186
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:13,240
you build up a tolerance and
then you stop using it and you,

3187
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:15,550
and it feels like shit
when you stop using it.

3188
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:16,660
Benzos are the worst.

3189
01:25:16,661 --> 01:25:18,580
They won't even admit you to
Rehab if you're on Benzos.

3190
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:19,120
Really?

3191
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:19,580
Yeah.

3192
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:19,840
Yeah.

3193
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:20,331
I have a buddy.

3194
01:25:20,331 --> 01:25:24,070
You couldn't go to rehab because
there's on Benzos and you stop using it.

3195
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,540
And then the second you stop using it,

3196
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:26,131
you get,

3197
01:25:26,131 --> 01:25:28,120
you get sick and you could die.

3198
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:28,954
You could have a stroke.

3199
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:31,630
But then when you go
back to using it again,

3200
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:32,190
you,

3201
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:33,160
your tolerance goes back.

3202
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:36,370
So you can take back to half a
milligram and you feel it again.

3203
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:37,510
But from what I understand,

3204
01:25:37,511 --> 01:25:40,900
Greg used more used to what
he used to use and it just,

3205
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:41,860
it has its way with them.

3206
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,330
I could be totally wrong.

3207
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:44,730
Uh,

3208
01:25:44,730 --> 01:25:45,011
and I,

3209
01:25:45,011 --> 01:25:45,880
and I hope I am.

3210
01:25:45,881 --> 01:25:46,714
I hope whatever.

3211
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:47,591
I Love Greg.

3212
01:25:47,591 --> 01:25:48,161
I really,

3213
01:25:48,161 --> 01:25:48,994
genuinely,

3214
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,040
I don't think there's anything
wrong with what you're saying.

3215
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:51,520
Yeah,

3216
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,353
you can just,

3217
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:53,620
you're saying something
and everybody knew,

3218
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:54,200
you know,

3219
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,880
it's like Patrice dying of diabetes.

3220
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:01,600
It's not a bad thing if you say the
Patrice didn't take care of his health

3221
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:02,463
because he didn't,

3222
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:02,930
you know,

3223
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:06,020
just the fact it doesn't make
them any less of an awesome guy,

3224
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:06,891
you know,

3225
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:10,280
or an amazing comedian or just
a fucking joy to be around.

3226
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,360
He was all those things,

3227
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:13,160
but he also had diabetes.

3228
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,300
It didn't take care of it.

3229
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:15,800
I think of him a lot,

3230
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:16,701
and by the way,

3231
01:26:16,701 --> 01:26:17,261
these are all,

3232
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:17,441
I,

3233
01:26:17,441 --> 01:26:17,541
I,

3234
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:21,830
whatever I say fucking shelve it until
what Burt's memory of his narrative is.

3235
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:23,930
But Patrice called his,

3236
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:25,490
uh,

3237
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:28,820
girlfriend Vaughn when he was
having a stroke and he's like,

3238
01:26:28,821 --> 01:26:29,870
I feel weird.

3239
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:31,370
Like something's going on.

3240
01:26:31,371 --> 01:26:32,570
I need to go to the hospital.

3241
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,261
And you know,

3242
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:34,370
it's so funny as a,

3243
01:26:34,371 --> 01:26:37,280
I think anyone with anxiety attacks
and anxiety attack feels like that.

3244
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:41,120
And so like sometimes I've been like
sitting in a hotel room and I just feel

3245
01:26:41,121 --> 01:26:41,481
weird.

3246
01:26:41,481 --> 01:26:42,140
Like the,

3247
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:43,070
like everything's shifting,

3248
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:44,090
you're having anxiety at Pepin,

3249
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:44,943
panic attack,

3250
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:48,080
and then you start thinking of a stroke
and I think of what Patrice said that

3251
01:26:48,081 --> 01:26:48,740
night.

3252
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:52,190
I do over take yoga or do you ever
meditate or anything like that?

3253
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:53,751
No.

3254
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:54,800
I'd like to get into meditation.

3255
01:26:54,801 --> 01:26:55,634
I really liked to.

3256
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:57,620
Do you ever exercise
when you're on the road?

3257
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:58,310
No,

3258
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:58,551
not,

3259
01:26:58,551 --> 01:27:00,200
not in the last 11 months.

3260
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:01,670
No exercise at all.

3261
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,070
Last 11 months probably.

3262
01:27:04,071 --> 01:27:04,340
No,

3263
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:05,173
not at all.

3264
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:06,620
I mean a little bit like scattered,

3265
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:06,951
like I'll,

3266
01:27:06,951 --> 01:27:07,640
I'll,

3267
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,690
I'll feel like up for other,

3268
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:10,220
goddammit.

3269
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:10,941
I feel like piece of shit.

3270
01:27:10,941 --> 01:27:12,860
Let me get down there and I'll run,

3271
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:13,701
I'll run,

3272
01:27:13,701 --> 01:27:16,310
walk two miles and I'll lift some weights,

3273
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:17,060
but not like,

3274
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:17,600
oh,

3275
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,260
like right now I'm on a pretty sincere
regiment where I'm working out.

3276
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:24,980
I think I'm about 10 I
get a walk on my fitbit.

3277
01:27:24,981 --> 01:27:27,200
I walk like 10 to 12 miles a day,

3278
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:28,700
which is pretty good burden.

3279
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:33,590
About 4,000 calories taken in under
2000 day writing down everything I had

3280
01:27:33,591 --> 01:27:33,921
taken.

3281
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:34,754
Other than this,

3282
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:35,870
do you doing?

3283
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:36,141
Yeah,

3284
01:27:36,141 --> 01:27:36,890
it's on my blog.

3285
01:27:36,890 --> 01:27:38,120
I just started doing it.

3286
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:40,970
I started November 29th.

3287
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:42,380
And who's giving you this number?

3288
01:27:42,381 --> 01:27:43,730
Like 2000 calorie me,

3289
01:27:43,731 --> 01:27:44,840
I'm registering the calories.

3290
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:45,660
But why,

3291
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,300
why did you decide on 2000?

3292
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:48,660
Because weight watchers,

3293
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:48,870
no,

3294
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:49,970
just me.

3295
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:50,740
His,

3296
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,040
the decided that would be enough.

3297
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:55,520
Now do you look at like
what you're actually eating?

3298
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:58,140
Have you ever tried like
what kind of Diet you're on?

3299
01:27:58,220 --> 01:27:58,551
What I'm saying?

3300
01:27:58,551 --> 01:27:59,990
I can literally run
through what I've eaten.

3301
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:00,410
Okay.

3302
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:02,690
Well just tell me like what
kind of foods are you avoiding?

3303
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:03,520
How about that?

3304
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,700
Avoiding a lot of breads.

3305
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:05,690
A lot of sugars.

3306
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,360
A lot of brands are all bald breads,

3307
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:08,060
all breads,

3308
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:08,691
no sugar,

3309
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:09,171
no sugar.

3310
01:28:09,171 --> 01:28:09,450
That's,

3311
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:10,580
those are two great steps.

3312
01:28:10,581 --> 01:28:10,870
Yeah.

3313
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:11,180
Uh,

3314
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:11,631
all breads,

3315
01:28:11,631 --> 01:28:12,464
all sugars.

3316
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,311
I'm cool with fruits.

3317
01:28:13,311 --> 01:28:14,720
I'm cool with a lot of vegetables.

3318
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,730
Every vegetable can make
its way in my mouth.

3319
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,200
Vegetables or running a trainable,

3320
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:20,180
nice lean protein.

3321
01:28:20,181 --> 01:28:21,014
Salmon,

3322
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:21,680
chicken.

3323
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,870
I do do the shredded
beef every now and then,

3324
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:25,160
which is just so good.

3325
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:27,830
But it like if I do like
we do Taco bowl night,

3326
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:30,230
I do tortillas and Romaine lettuce.

3327
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,513
Um,

3328
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:32,720
and then,

3329
01:28:32,721 --> 01:28:33,380
and that's,

3330
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:33,770
and like,

3331
01:28:33,770 --> 01:28:36,110
and then I'll do all almond
butter and rice cakes as a snack.

3332
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:37,610
The Avocado.

3333
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:40,160
And you've been doing this for right now?

3334
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:42,230
I'm six days,

3335
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:43,100
six days,

3336
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,930
and I've lost 13 pounds.

3337
01:28:44,931 --> 01:28:45,764
That's amazing.

3338
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:46,400
Yeah.

3339
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:46,731
Yeah.

3340
01:28:46,731 --> 01:28:49,490
If you can keep that up
for like a few months.

3341
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,150
Oh my God.

3342
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:50,601
12 pounds,

3343
01:28:50,601 --> 01:28:51,110
12 pounds,

3344
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:52,280
12 pounds for Trump.

3345
01:28:52,281 --> 01:28:52,411
Boy,

3346
01:28:52,411 --> 01:28:52,971
four pounds.

3347
01:28:52,971 --> 01:28:53,804
That's amazing.

3348
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:54,830
That's great.

3349
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:55,100
Yeah.

3350
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:55,461
And then I,

3351
01:28:55,461 --> 01:28:55,651
and I,

3352
01:28:55,651 --> 01:28:56,690
and I'm just really active.

3353
01:28:56,691 --> 01:28:58,520
I get up in the morning and uh,

3354
01:28:58,521 --> 01:28:59,600
and I just go at it.

3355
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:00,261
It's like,

3356
01:29:00,261 --> 01:29:00,550
it's,

3357
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:01,040
but it's,

3358
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,370
it's very easy to do when you're at home.

3359
01:29:02,371 --> 01:29:03,330
It's really hard to do on the road.

3360
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,020
Yeah.

3361
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:04,650
It's not hard to do,

3362
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:04,831
do it.

3363
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:05,700
Let me take that back.

3364
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:07,800
It's not hard to do
when you do a stand up.

3365
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:08,993
We do a stand up.

3366
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:09,780
You have plenty of time,

3367
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:10,071
man.

3368
01:29:10,071 --> 01:29:10,380
You got,

3369
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:11,520
I always say to myself,

3370
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:13,440
I work out at five o'clock
everyday doing stand up.

3371
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,190
Yeah,

3372
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:14,721
you are.

3373
01:29:14,721 --> 01:29:15,060
Um,

3374
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:18,300
you're in a weird position because you're
doing a TV show and there's TV shows

3375
01:29:18,301 --> 01:29:21,300
and the trousers to be shown to
actually three to two or three.

3376
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:22,200
Which ones are you doing?

3377
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:23,250
I'm doing everything on the network.

3378
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:24,380
The ones,

3379
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:24,900
uh,

3380
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:25,770
I can't talk about two of them,

3381
01:29:25,771 --> 01:29:26,410
but okay.

3382
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:29,070
Parts conqueror I can talk about because
I've accidentally spilled the beans.

3383
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:30,213
Um,

3384
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:30,720
and then Trey,

3385
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,430
you bring in Burke the conqueror back.

3386
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:32,881
It's back.

3387
01:29:32,881 --> 01:29:34,020
We already shot a whole full season.

3388
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:34,890
Jesus.

3389
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:35,430
Yeah,

3390
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:35,701
did,

3391
01:29:35,701 --> 01:29:35,970
uh,

3392
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,230
six half hours.

3393
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:38,460
Seven hours.

3394
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:39,380
Wow.

3395
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:39,840
It's good.

3396
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,950
When you're out there doing this,

3397
01:29:40,951 --> 01:29:42,250
how often do you do in stand up?

3398
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:43,613
Uh,

3399
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,520
say I shoot birth,

3400
01:29:45,521 --> 01:29:47,010
conquer 13 weekends.

3401
01:29:47,011 --> 01:29:49,440
I probably did stand up during that time,

3402
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:52,020
probably four weekends out of that.

3403
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:52,920
But it,

3404
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:53,071
no,

3405
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:53,191
no,

3406
01:29:53,191 --> 01:29:53,371
no.

3407
01:29:53,371 --> 01:29:56,370
I take that back probably more
than that before while shooting.

3408
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:57,204
Like I'll shoot,

3409
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:58,650
I did Toledo while we're shooting.

3410
01:29:58,890 --> 01:29:59,723
I did,

3411
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,653
uh,

3412
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:02,010
Atlanta while we're shooting.

3413
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:03,070
I did pitch.

3414
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:03,630
I do like,

3415
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:06,420
I'll do the weekend when I'm
there or an abbreviated weekend,

3416
01:30:06,421 --> 01:30:07,230
like Friday,

3417
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:07,290
Saturday.

3418
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:09,770
What do you think you'd be happier
doing and you think you'd be happier?

3419
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:11,310
Just doing stand up all the time,

3420
01:30:11,311 --> 01:30:12,600
just killing it on the road.

3421
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:16,410
Or would you be happier if
you continue to do these,

3422
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:17,310
you know,

3423
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:22,310
giant workload schedule shows
like [inaudible] 11 episodes here,

3424
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,061
12 episodes,

3425
01:30:24,061 --> 01:30:25,530
there are six of this,

3426
01:30:25,531 --> 01:30:27,660
seven of that on the road for 11 months.

3427
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,240
Would you be more happy
if you were doing standup?

3428
01:30:30,241 --> 01:30:31,074
You think?

3429
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,033
Um,

3430
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:33,413
I,

3431
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:34,443
it's,

3432
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:35,071
it's really,

3433
01:30:35,071 --> 01:30:38,410
it's not hard to say because
my heart is in stand up.

3434
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:39,720
It's always been in standup.

3435
01:30:39,721 --> 01:30:44,370
The only thing I'm proud of in my life
is the fact that I am a standup comedian.

3436
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:44,941
Uh,

3437
01:30:44,941 --> 01:30:45,774
the fact that I can,

3438
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:48,000
and it doesn't happen all that often,

3439
01:30:48,001 --> 01:30:51,780
but the fact that I can roll into
the comedy cellar and I'll know Jim,

3440
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:52,643
I know Bobby,

3441
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:54,090
I'll know all the guys there.

3442
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:57,540
The fact that it's like a fraternity
that you've earned that you can't get,

3443
01:30:57,570 --> 01:30:59,040
you can't like just parent.

3444
01:30:59,050 --> 01:31:00,750
Your parents pay money and you join it.

3445
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:02,303
Um,

3446
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:07,350
I will say very candidly that money is
having money is really nice when you have

3447
01:31:07,351 --> 01:31:08,184
a family.

3448
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:08,641
Uh,

3449
01:31:08,641 --> 01:31:09,930
traveling stinks.

3450
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:10,973
But like,

3451
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:11,371
man,

3452
01:31:11,371 --> 01:31:15,990
I've gotten opportunities in my life
this last six years that no one will ever

3453
01:31:15,991 --> 01:31:16,680
get in their life.

3454
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,500
I mean like,

3455
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:17,750
uh,

3456
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:20,100
like from doing the show,

3457
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:21,420
this doing the show is like,

3458
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:22,650
it's amazing.

3459
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:22,881
I mean,

3460
01:31:22,881 --> 01:31:24,840
it's working on travel channel's amazing.

3461
01:31:24,841 --> 01:31:27,720
Anthony Bordain would tell you
that like at the same thing,

3462
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,150
you just have these experiences done,

3463
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,150
nine of the ones on TV,

3464
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,460
but these great life experiences that,

3465
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:33,121
I mean,

3466
01:31:33,121 --> 01:31:33,201
I,

3467
01:31:33,201 --> 01:31:33,521
I'm a,

3468
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:36,450
I'm a horrible person to be sitting
next to with my wife at a party because

3469
01:31:36,451 --> 01:31:36,961
someone will go,

3470
01:31:36,961 --> 01:31:37,111
oh,

3471
01:31:37,111 --> 01:31:38,790
I just did this and I haven't,

3472
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:42,750
I have five experiences
that are so much different,

3473
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:44,063
cooler,

3474
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:45,210
insane,

3475
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,250
unbelievable than anyone's.

3476
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:47,490
I'm,

3477
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:49,080
I go to this all the time.

3478
01:31:49,081 --> 01:31:50,760
You called me one morning and you said,

3479
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:51,661
what are you doing?

3480
01:31:51,661 --> 01:31:51,991
And I said,

3481
01:31:51,991 --> 01:31:53,460
I'm riding Vietnam,

3482
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:56,700
I'm riding a moped in
Vietnam through rice patties.

3483
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:57,361
And you were like,

3484
01:31:57,361 --> 01:31:58,950
are you fucking writing about this?

3485
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:01,430
And I was just sitting in
a rice patty going like,

3486
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:02,400
I was like,

3487
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:02,650
ah.

3488
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:04,180
I was like one of the coolest calls ever.

3489
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:05,043
Yeah.

3490
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,090
So like I don't want to lose that.

3491
01:32:07,091 --> 01:32:07,511
I and I,

3492
01:32:07,511 --> 01:32:09,680
I love that network and I love the
people that work in that network.

3493
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:10,301
I always want to do that.

3494
01:32:10,301 --> 01:32:13,310
But I think you know this and I know
you know this and I know that bill,

3495
01:32:13,311 --> 01:32:16,780
no bill burr said the same thing to me
in an Al Madrigal said the same thing to

3496
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:21,130
me is that I've definitely unfocused
on stand up for the last year.

3497
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:22,390
Last year I've been,

3498
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:24,880
I've been touching go.

3499
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:25,781
I don't know,

3500
01:32:25,781 --> 01:32:26,614
I always,

3501
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,700
I'm like that I got the same shit that
those star athlete quarterbacks like

3502
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:35,050
Michael Vick's brother had that he had
just a bunch of talent and a bunch of

3503
01:32:35,051 --> 01:32:37,450
opportunity and then
just was like fuck it,

3504
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:39,250
I'll go pro and then didn't go pro.

3505
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:43,390
You know I feel like that's sometimes
where you're like I got a lot of talent

3506
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:43,890
and I,

3507
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:48,400
I got a lot of ability and I can go
around and fuck around on stage and have a

3508
01:32:48,401 --> 01:32:48,820
good time.

3509
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:52,840
But when it comes to like
making a solid hour and like,

3510
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,310
and like doom a buns.

3511
01:32:54,311 --> 01:32:57,170
Did I look at bonds cause he's
my contemporary Tommy Tommy,

3512
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:57,890
Tommy Scorer.

3513
01:32:57,890 --> 01:32:58,723
Yeah.

3514
01:32:58,850 --> 01:32:59,470
I look at him.

3515
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:00,071
I look at Ari,

3516
01:33:00,071 --> 01:33:00,940
he's my contemporary,

3517
01:33:00,941 --> 01:33:02,130
these are my contemporaries.

3518
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:03,573
And I go,

3519
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:04,493
man,

3520
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:05,453
they're murdering that.

3521
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:06,040
They're,

3522
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:06,720
they're killing it.

3523
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:07,290
And now,

3524
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:07,970
now granted,

3525
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:09,730
and Ariana talk about this or it's like,

3526
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,110
I'd love to have your job.

3527
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:12,430
That's such a cool job.

3528
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:13,660
But like,

3529
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:14,050
where's,

3530
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:15,100
where's the trade off?

3531
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:15,820
You know,

3532
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:17,770
like a little bit.

3533
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:20,800
There's gotta be a trade off 100%.

3534
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:21,820
There's no way around it,

3535
01:33:21,821 --> 01:33:22,001
man.

3536
01:33:22,001 --> 01:33:23,360
I got to retweet something for our,

3537
01:33:23,361 --> 01:33:24,370
I'm just remembering those,

3538
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:25,610
um,

3539
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:27,190
there's going to be a trade off 100%.

3540
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:28,060
There's no way around it.

3541
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:29,651
If you're going to do,

3542
01:33:29,651 --> 01:33:29,980
I mean,

3543
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:32,440
that's how I always felt when I was doing,

3544
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:33,303
um,

3545
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:34,263
fear factor,

3546
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:36,160
but always felt like a big trade off.

3547
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:38,710
But go back to yourself in a time machine.

3548
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,530
Yeah.

3549
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:39,681
Well,

3550
01:33:39,681 --> 01:33:40,251
I would've done it.

3551
01:33:40,251 --> 01:33:43,280
I would do it again because I made
enough money that I didn't have to give a

3552
01:33:43,281 --> 01:33:44,210
fuck about anything.

3553
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,261
And in that,

3554
01:33:45,261 --> 01:33:46,340
not in the,

3555
01:33:46,341 --> 01:33:47,570
not giving a fuck,

3556
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,460
having not giving a fuck money like true,

3557
01:33:49,461 --> 01:33:53,030
not giving a fuck money is
when you can be yourself.

3558
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:54,020
You don't have to say,

3559
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:56,820
oh I shouldn't say this because then
people are going to be upset at me.

3560
01:33:56,850 --> 01:33:59,960
Maybe that'll stop me from getting an
audition or stop me from getting a,

3561
01:34:00,490 --> 01:34:01,323
but if you,

3562
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:03,790
if you have enough money that you
don't have to worry about that anymore,

3563
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:04,740
then you can be yourself.

3564
01:34:04,741 --> 01:34:06,230
So on stage you can be yourself.

3565
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:06,980
Uh,

3566
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:07,400
I'm still,

3567
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,081
I'm always like,

3568
01:34:08,081 --> 01:34:08,590
I'm not,

3569
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:10,030
not going to be myself on stage,

3570
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:11,050
but,

3571
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:12,160
but here's the question,

3572
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:13,023
is there,

3573
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,560
is there,

3574
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:15,920
there's the Joe Rogan and stop,

3575
01:34:16,730 --> 01:34:18,410
there's a time we should
stop hauling it out

3576
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:19,960
and then,

3577
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,310
and go and do what you love the best.

3578
01:34:22,370 --> 01:34:22,851
That's,

3579
01:34:22,851 --> 01:34:23,540
you know,

3580
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:24,260
or do less.

3581
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:25,910
I'm like not maybe not three shows.

3582
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:27,171
Yeah,

3583
01:34:27,171 --> 01:34:28,004
definitely.

3584
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:28,430
Yeah,

3585
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:29,480
definitely three is too many.

3586
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:30,453
The,

3587
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:30,891
okay,

3588
01:34:30,891 --> 01:34:31,760
here's the question.

3589
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:33,163
Um,

3590
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:37,430
would without,

3591
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:39,440
where do you consider whoring it out?

3592
01:34:39,770 --> 01:34:40,603
Cause I don't consider it.

3593
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:42,260
I didn't think I'd done really for me out.

3594
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:45,520
I hoard it out for like six
years doing fear factor.

3595
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:49,970
I don't think that my standup got better
when I stopped doing fear factor pretty

3596
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:51,073
positively.

3597
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,033
Absolutely.

3598
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:53,990
So go to like shiny happy Jihad.

3599
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:57,680
It was like one of my best things ever
and I did it like right when I or right

3600
01:34:57,681 --> 01:34:58,514
when it ended

3601
01:34:58,670 --> 01:34:59,530
and then uh,

3602
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:03,260
from shiny happy Jihad talking monkey's
in space is probably my best one after

3603
01:35:03,261 --> 01:35:03,890
that.

3604
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:04,820
And that was no,

3605
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:05,960
no fear factor at all.

3606
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:06,830
No TV at all.

3607
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:08,510
Just doing the EOC and stand up.

3608
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:13,900
And then I honestly think like now might
be doing too many things with a podcast

3609
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:18,500
and then doing the UFC and
doing standup might be too many.

3610
01:35:18,501 --> 01:35:21,350
I think podcasts and standup
is like the way to go.

3611
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,560
I think those are just
having less stuff and more,

3612
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:26,660
the more the less you have to focus on,

3613
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:29,090
the more you can focus on those things,

3614
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:30,411
you know?

3615
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:31,490
And then free time,

3616
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:32,483
free free times.

3617
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:34,070
It's giant.

3618
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:34,340
Not,

3619
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:36,800
not having to go buy
anybody else's schedule.

3620
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:37,251
Like,

3621
01:35:37,251 --> 01:35:41,240
if you want to go out to the salt and
sea and go visit that fucking weird guys

3622
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:44,900
hill that he's painted and all these
religious symbols and signs and crosses,

3623
01:35:44,901 --> 01:35:45,990
you should be able to just do that.

3624
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:46,790
But then Whoa,

3625
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:49,280
stop on that thought because
that's what I do for a living.

3626
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:49,611
Right?

3627
01:35:49,611 --> 01:35:52,370
But you have to do it with a camera and
you have to be with these people and

3628
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:52,640
everything.

3629
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,390
You're still in the kitchen makeup bird.

3630
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,410
I'm gonna to put a microphone on you
and you're doing it for 12 hours a day,

3631
01:35:57,411 --> 01:36:00,530
and then you're going out to eat and
some strange hotel in Boise with your

3632
01:36:00,531 --> 01:36:01,400
fucking crew.

3633
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,010
You know,

3634
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:02,600
it's,

3635
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,070
there's great things to that,

3636
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:04,933
no doubt about it.

3637
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:08,920
But I think that if you ultimately
want to do your best stand up,

3638
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:10,610
you probably should do less of it.

3639
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:11,500
Right.

3640
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:11,681
Well,

3641
01:36:11,681 --> 01:36:14,110
life was a big believer in putting
what you want in the universe.

3642
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:14,621
And so like,

3643
01:36:14,621 --> 01:36:15,431
right when she told me that,

3644
01:36:15,431 --> 01:36:15,760
I think it's,

3645
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,110
that might be a Scientology thing,

3646
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:18,630
but scientologist,

3647
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:19,391
no,

3648
01:36:19,391 --> 01:36:20,201
but I gotta be honest with you,

3649
01:36:20,201 --> 01:36:21,460
I like a lot of their ideas.

3650
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:22,750
I'm not a big,

3651
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:23,210
I'm not,

3652
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:23,460
I,

3653
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:24,293
I,

3654
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:25,570
I like all there actually.

3655
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:26,950
I like all their crazy ideas.

3656
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:28,930
They're the ones that
they really grounded in.

3657
01:36:28,931 --> 01:36:30,820
I don't get like one c runs.

3658
01:36:30,821 --> 01:36:31,690
I do believe in alien.

3659
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:33,640
I do believe in aliens.

3660
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:34,890
What do you believe what I'm saying?

3661
01:36:34,891 --> 01:36:37,990
I believe in aliens believe there's
fucking life forms out there.

3662
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:39,191
I don't know.

3663
01:36:39,191 --> 01:36:39,911
Things started us,

3664
01:36:39,911 --> 01:36:40,391
I don't know,

3665
01:36:40,391 --> 01:36:42,550
but I don't know if they
started as just as much as,

3666
01:36:42,551 --> 01:36:45,400
I don't know if Jesus really got out
and moved to fucking rock and was like,

3667
01:36:45,401 --> 01:36:46,330
I'm bad bitches.

3668
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:47,260
So like,

3669
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:48,220
like there's a lot like,

3670
01:36:48,221 --> 01:36:50,980
I like that I hear about Scientology.

3671
01:36:50,981 --> 01:36:51,610
That makes sense.

3672
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:51,821
They've,

3673
01:36:51,821 --> 01:36:53,560
there's acting courses they teach in la.

3674
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:56,560
Every young actor you ever hang out with
took it at Scientology acting course.

3675
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:58,540
And it's about accountability.

3676
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:00,640
A fucking being a better person,

3677
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:01,090
uh,

3678
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:02,230
being your authentic self.

3679
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:03,610
It's all Depok jokes

3680
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:06,130
for shit while I'm in the middle
of the reading going clear.

3681
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:07,270
And when I say in the middle of it,

3682
01:37:07,271 --> 01:37:09,580
I put it down and I won't
pick it up for a week or two.

3683
01:37:09,581 --> 01:37:11,950
And then I pick it up for a few
days and I'll throw it down again.

3684
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:12,790
I just can't,

3685
01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:16,600
it's so bizarre that I'm worried that
I'm going to get infected by this dude's

3686
01:37:16,601 --> 01:37:17,830
ridiculous ideas.

3687
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:19,650
[inaudible] was not,

3688
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:23,980
my dad represented a Scientology
through the infancy stages,

3689
01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:25,360
representing them as a lawyer,

3690
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:26,470
one of their head lawyers.

3691
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:27,480
Oh my God,

3692
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:28,790
my dad.

3693
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:29,623
Oh,

3694
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:32,500
we're out of Tampa and continues to peel.

3695
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:33,900
My Dad can grow.

3696
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:34,130
Uh,

3697
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:35,590
my dad is not like that at all.

3698
01:37:35,591 --> 01:37:36,340
My Dad don't even,

3699
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:36,911
he's religious,

3700
01:37:36,911 --> 01:37:37,690
but Catholic,

3701
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:39,100
only Catholic in his sixties,

3702
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:41,080
like fearing the fucking,

3703
01:37:41,990 --> 01:37:42,490
you know,

3704
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:43,323
whatever's going to happen.

3705
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:44,520
Hell yeah.

3706
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:45,340
Yeah.

3707
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:45,790
And uh,

3708
01:37:45,790 --> 01:37:46,331
but my dad,

3709
01:37:46,331 --> 01:37:47,230
when we were kids,

3710
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:48,730
l Ron Hubbard would show up.

3711
01:37:48,731 --> 01:37:49,450
My Dad's,

3712
01:37:49,450 --> 01:37:50,660
my dad would have to go out to his yard.

3713
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:55,680
He lived in Clearwater and flew out to
la a bunch because we are one the spot

3714
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,720
over the rest of the Seahawks are.

3715
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:58,410
Yeah.

3716
01:37:58,410 --> 01:37:59,140
And so,

3717
01:37:59,140 --> 01:37:59,973
uh,

3718
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:02,170
and so my dad doesn't
believe in any of that shit.

3719
01:38:02,171 --> 01:38:03,010
My Dad's like a phony,

3720
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:03,860
but like,

3721
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:05,970
like phooey on that shit fool.

3722
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:06,430
Yeah.

3723
01:38:06,430 --> 01:38:07,330
And my mom,

3724
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:08,730
I remember they went to a party,

3725
01:38:09,010 --> 01:38:10,660
the one story is that
my dad had told my mom,

3726
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:14,020
don't fucking talk to anybody because
you will get convinced that Shit's real.

3727
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:16,453
But uh,

3728
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:16,881
but yeah,

3729
01:38:16,881 --> 01:38:17,714
the uh,

3730
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:22,830
the and has been through the Scientology
acting classes and a lot of their shit

3731
01:38:22,911 --> 01:38:23,510
makes sense.

3732
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:27,230
It's dated a girl who went to
cytology acting class and really?

3733
01:38:27,290 --> 01:38:27,950
Yeah.

3734
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:31,400
And I went to the acting
class with her at the time.

3735
01:38:31,610 --> 01:38:32,061
And so,

3736
01:38:32,061 --> 01:38:32,390
uh,

3737
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:32,961
I she,

3738
01:38:32,961 --> 01:38:34,970
cause she wanted me to
go to her acting class.

3739
01:38:34,971 --> 01:38:37,610
She was burrowed it all
are you on be at this time?

3740
01:38:37,611 --> 01:38:38,510
He did so much tension.

3741
01:38:38,511 --> 01:38:38,770
Yes,

3742
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:39,603
I was.

3743
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:40,250
Um,

3744
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:42,430
she needed so much attention
that was so ridiculous.

3745
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:43,340
She wanted to watch,

3746
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:45,710
she wanted you to watch her rehearse,

3747
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:48,650
like for her thing in an acting class.

3748
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:52,820
And she made me come to her acting class
once when they did this thing called

3749
01:38:52,821 --> 01:38:54,020
private moments.

3750
01:38:54,410 --> 01:38:55,820
And this is what private moments are,

3751
01:38:56,270 --> 01:38:57,680
what a private moment is.

3752
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:02,390
You would go onstage and you would just
do stuff like they had like a little

3753
01:39:02,391 --> 01:39:02,990
set,

3754
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:05,990
so they had like a bed and they had some
books and they had like a little fake

3755
01:39:05,991 --> 01:39:10,880
kitchen area and you would just go on
stage and pretend that you were just

3756
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:12,560
hanging out by herself.

3757
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:14,180
Like maybe reading a book.

3758
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:15,063
And,

3759
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:19,470
and I remember sitting
there sucking this all for,

3760
01:39:19,490 --> 01:39:19,971
first of all,

3761
01:39:19,971 --> 01:39:21,020
the relationship was a joke.

3762
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,270
It was a disaster from jump,

3763
01:39:23,271 --> 01:39:23,991
but she was hot.

3764
01:39:23,991 --> 01:39:24,824
It was fun.

3765
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:28,430
But watching this whole thing go down,

3766
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,121
I was like,

3767
01:39:29,121 --> 01:39:29,480
okay,

3768
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:30,650
do you understand what's happening here?

3769
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:31,530
They think this is,

3770
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:32,600
this is not an acting,

3771
01:39:32,630 --> 01:39:34,600
you're not acting like this is an active,

3772
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:37,130
what this is is that they're
giving you a little fix.

3773
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:38,120
Okay.

3774
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:39,860
You have this desire for attention,

3775
01:39:39,861 --> 01:39:41,630
this overwhelming desire for attention.

3776
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:42,321
And they say,

3777
01:39:42,321 --> 01:39:42,621
Hey,

3778
01:39:42,621 --> 01:39:43,151
you know what I mean?

3779
01:39:43,151 --> 01:39:44,300
How do you think for you to prepare?

3780
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:46,730
But you can be the person on
stage for the next 10 minutes.

3781
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:47,990
Everyone's going to look at you.

3782
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:48,520
Yeah.

3783
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,340
That's killing me 15 minutes with people,

3784
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:52,300
all my God thumb.

3785
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:53,390
And that was okay.

3786
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:54,050
Um,

3787
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:55,280
what were you doing with the book there?

3788
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:56,690
Is that how you normally
would read a book?

3789
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:57,760
Well,

3790
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,640
what I read,

3791
01:39:58,970 --> 01:40:01,810
I like to eat things that
are implied and so like that,

3792
01:40:01,811 --> 01:40:06,110
like it was like they would go over
the public moment or the private moment

3793
01:40:06,111 --> 01:40:07,040
rather with,

3794
01:40:07,041 --> 01:40:07,360
uh,

3795
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:07,660
the,

3796
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:08,630
the various actors.

3797
01:40:08,631 --> 01:40:12,380
And I would love to sit there and listen
to the things that they would say.

3798
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:13,450
And they're PR I only made,

3799
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:14,360
it's like two of them,

3800
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,190
two classes where I was like,

3801
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:17,270
I can't do this.

3802
01:40:17,271 --> 01:40:18,040
And all eyes.

3803
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:21,160
That could be a TV show on comedy
central if you just did that with comics,

3804
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:22,420
five comics,

3805
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:23,920
Jim Norton's tribe private moments.

3806
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:28,030
And it's just five minutes of gym in a
room just watching him fucking do gym.

3807
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:29,890
You're see that show Nathan for you?

3808
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:31,000
It's one of the,

3809
01:40:31,001 --> 01:40:32,230
I think one of my favorite shows.

3810
01:40:32,231 --> 01:40:32,920
That song.

3811
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:33,400
It's a,

3812
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:34,900
it's this comedian Nathan,

3813
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,610
and he gets hired to like,

3814
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:42,760
like go to these small businesses and
help their business by using weird ways

3815
01:40:42,761 --> 01:40:42,941
like,

3816
01:40:42,941 --> 01:40:44,350
like as an example,

3817
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:44,651
uh,

3818
01:40:44,651 --> 01:40:46,270
this bar ever since,

3819
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:46,810
uh,

3820
01:40:46,810 --> 01:40:47,770
smoking became,

3821
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:49,300
I got interrupted for right now.

3822
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:52,630
It's totally sounds like comedy
central's buying ad space through Brian.

3823
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:54,100
He's

3824
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:54,560
like,

3825
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,360
does anyone see where you all companies?

3826
01:40:56,730 --> 01:40:57,900
So like as an example,

3827
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:58,280
uh,

3828
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:01,530
bars can't have smoking in them and
they're saying that they've lost a lot of

3829
01:41:01,531 --> 01:41:03,150
money since that's happened.

3830
01:41:03,151 --> 01:41:03,990
A lot of smokers,

3831
01:41:03,991 --> 01:41:04,291
you know,

3832
01:41:04,291 --> 01:41:05,600
want to smoke in the bar,

3833
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:05,791
blah,

3834
01:41:05,791 --> 01:41:05,911
blah,

3835
01:41:05,911 --> 01:41:06,420
blah.

3836
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:10,260
So he found a loophole where
you can make it a theater,

3837
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:11,760
like a bar being a theater.

3838
01:41:11,761 --> 01:41:13,110
So he put up two seats,

3839
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:16,710
sold like tickets so that you would sit
down on these cds and just sit there and

3840
01:41:16,711 --> 01:41:18,180
watch a bar for an hour.

3841
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:19,440
That giving the bar,

3842
01:41:19,441 --> 01:41:22,320
being able to smoke cigarettes
as if there were a play.

3843
01:41:22,590 --> 01:41:23,580
And it's just interesting.

3844
01:41:23,581 --> 01:41:23,801
Like I,

3845
01:41:23,801 --> 01:41:26,130
we hacks normal everyday things.

3846
01:41:26,131 --> 01:41:27,150
It's really funny.

3847
01:41:27,510 --> 01:41:27,781
Uh,

3848
01:41:27,781 --> 01:41:28,170
but,

3849
01:41:28,170 --> 01:41:28,460
uh,

3850
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:29,490
what's the one he did?

3851
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:29,780
I mean,

3852
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:31,380
he's a very funny Starbucks.

3853
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:32,290
Starbucks,

3854
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:32,970
Starbucks ones,

3855
01:41:32,970 --> 01:41:36,030
everyone knows where using parody laws,

3856
01:41:36,031 --> 01:41:37,970
he made a whole thing
called dumb Starbucks.

3857
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:38,120
Right.

3858
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:39,360
It looked just like a Starbucks.

3859
01:41:39,361 --> 01:41:42,620
He could sell coffee because he was
using a parody law and he does this like

3860
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:44,440
every episode when it's so amazing.

3861
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:46,720
Dumb Starbucks one dumb Starbucks.

3862
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:47,950
It's actually a pretty good show.

3863
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:48,330
Yeah.

3864
01:41:48,330 --> 01:41:49,163
Uh,

3865
01:41:49,370 --> 01:41:49,690
I,

3866
01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:49,970
I'll,

3867
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:51,490
I'll be honest with the
better show than Matt.

3868
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:52,391
Who's the guy,

3869
01:41:52,391 --> 01:41:52,751
you guys,

3870
01:41:52,751 --> 01:41:53,501
I know his name.

3871
01:41:53,501 --> 01:41:54,334
It'll come to me.

3872
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:55,500
The guy you had the,

3873
01:41:55,501 --> 01:41:56,740
he always wore the blue hat.

3874
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:58,150
They'd had a comedy central show.

3875
01:41:58,151 --> 01:41:58,984
He came in.

3876
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:02,230
I kind of felt like it might've
been like a shoot of Freelander.

3877
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:02,501
No,

3878
01:42:02,501 --> 01:42:02,621
no,

3879
01:42:02,621 --> 01:42:02,771
no,

3880
01:42:02,771 --> 01:42:03,010
no.

3881
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:03,840
I know Judah.

3882
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:04,570
Um,

3883
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:07,100
he did the show with coach Cook,

3884
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:07,880
Ben,

3885
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:08,713
Ben,

3886
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:10,150
that guys,

3887
01:42:10,150 --> 01:42:15,150
that guy show was super funny and he
didn't get like enough of a of a chance.

3888
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:16,781
What was the name?

3889
01:42:16,781 --> 01:42:18,400
Ben Franklin Franklin.

3890
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:23,280
It was my first father
Johnson been holding off.

3891
01:42:23,290 --> 01:42:23,740
Bang.

3892
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:24,320
You got him in here,

3893
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:24,690
right?

3894
01:42:24,690 --> 01:42:25,150
Yeah,

3895
01:42:25,150 --> 01:42:26,320
I liked his show a lot.

3896
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:27,760
Do you ever hear his coach one?

3897
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:28,390
No.

3898
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:28,811
Oh,

3899
01:42:28,811 --> 01:42:29,680
it's so funny.

3900
01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:31,120
Can you play it Jamie?

3901
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:32,320
But dog though.

3902
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,030
Never mind central pause.

3903
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:34,953
Oh really?

3904
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:36,130
Uh,

3905
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:37,300
cause they have their own sort.

3906
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:38,590
They have the comedy central live.

3907
01:42:38,591 --> 01:42:42,370
They have their own website where they
encourage people to go watch their show

3908
01:42:42,371 --> 01:42:43,360
and talk to Ari about that.

3909
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:44,590
No,

3910
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:45,423
he doesn't like it.

3911
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:46,721
I don't know.

3912
01:42:46,721 --> 01:42:47,554
I haven't talked to me.

3913
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,001
What does that mean?

3914
01:42:49,001 --> 01:42:49,391
Fucking no,

3915
01:42:49,391 --> 01:42:50,260
he doesn't like kids upstairs.

3916
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:51,300
We're fine grownups.

3917
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:52,570
And we know how this Internet works.

3918
01:42:52,571 --> 01:42:52,781
It's like,

3919
01:42:52,781 --> 01:42:53,021
look,

3920
01:42:53,021 --> 01:42:54,580
my kid's never going to
get one over on me on me,

3921
01:42:54,581 --> 01:42:57,550
on Instagram because I've been in this
shit and you're never going to bring a

3922
01:42:57,551 --> 01:42:58,330
person.

3923
01:42:58,330 --> 01:42:59,470
I promise you this.

3924
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:00,160
And I,

3925
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:00,993
I,

3926
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:06,250
I bite my tongue sometimes
a PSAP [inaudible] central.

3927
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:07,180
I have a deal with them.

3928
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:10,023
Okay.

3929
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:12,940
He doesn't like it that they
pull stuff off of youtube.

3930
01:43:12,941 --> 01:43:13,600
Is that what it is?

3931
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:13,870
Yeah.

3932
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:14,703
I love you already.

3933
01:43:14,710 --> 01:43:16,420
This would already said
I love you already.

3934
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:17,440
Whatever you said,

3935
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:21,010
Kj fucking we both agree with this.

3936
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:22,173
Uh,

3937
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:23,090
you never will.

3938
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:25,810
Look fucking people find content
is where you find content.

3939
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,840
If content drives you
to traditional media,

3940
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:30,490
then so be it.

3941
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:32,440
That's how this fucking business works.

3942
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:35,170
We push it on youtube because that's
where people are finding content.

3943
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:36,070
And then you put it,

3944
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:39,610
I put five minutes of a show on
youtube and you like it and you go,

3945
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:40,960
I kind of want to watch my show.

3946
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:42,153
And then you go there.

3947
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:43,810
Like when I look at at trailers,

3948
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:48,070
I watched trailers for movies that I
will see inside movie theaters on Youtube

3949
01:43:48,071 --> 01:43:48,940
and an on apple movies.

3950
01:43:48,941 --> 01:43:49,600
That's why I go,

3951
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,290
okay.

3952
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:52,630
And so comedy central and,

3953
01:43:52,631 --> 01:43:52,841
and,

3954
01:43:52,841 --> 01:43:54,710
and travels guilty of this as well.

3955
01:43:54,711 --> 01:43:55,270
Sometimes

3956
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:56,530
they're trying to get the ad,

3957
01:43:56,770 --> 01:43:58,420
they try to get all the
traffic to their web.

3958
01:43:58,710 --> 01:44:03,270
It's the older people in the company
that don't technically get how people are

3959
01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:06,930
using their content and
finding their content and,

3960
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:07,351
and,

3961
01:44:07,351 --> 01:44:07,830
and,

3962
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:09,090
and enjoying their content.

3963
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:10,320
I know how I enjoy mine.

3964
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:14,580
I sit online and a fucking watch it on
youtube and I go through youtube and I go

3965
01:44:14,581 --> 01:44:16,350
into a spiral and next thing you know,

3966
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:19,110
I'm watching butterflies getting
extracted out of a guy's back.

3967
01:44:19,230 --> 01:44:20,520
Now I'm looking at ear cleaning,

3968
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:21,960
now I'm watching opion gym.

3969
01:44:22,140 --> 01:44:23,340
Like that's how it goes.

3970
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:26,110
But no one that's like [inaudible],

3971
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:28,860
my wife is 45 shouldn't
use fucking youtube.

3972
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,720
She's never used youtube in her life.

3973
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:33,180
She tried to find a video the other day.

3974
01:44:33,181 --> 01:44:33,481
She's like,

3975
01:44:33,481 --> 01:44:34,231
it's on Facebook.

3976
01:44:34,231 --> 01:44:34,411
I go,

3977
01:44:34,411 --> 01:44:34,561
well,

3978
01:44:34,561 --> 01:44:36,690
Google the things you remember from it,

3979
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:39,660
Google that and those are the
codes keywords and you'll find it.

3980
01:44:39,661 --> 01:44:39,901
She's like,

3981
01:44:39,901 --> 01:44:40,051
no,

3982
01:44:40,051 --> 01:44:40,950
it's not on Google.

3983
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,000
It's on Facebook,

3984
01:44:42,270 --> 01:44:43,550
but that's who's that?

3985
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,670
She's running comedy central,

3986
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:45,653
so when they go,

3987
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:50,100
we don't want any of our content on
youtube because it's a bunch of ad sales

3988
01:44:50,101 --> 01:44:51,420
dollars that we're missing out on.

3989
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:54,180
Maybe they're accurate in some extent,

3990
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:54,810
but I,

3991
01:44:54,810 --> 01:44:55,890
I would argue that

3992
01:44:57,450 --> 01:45:01,590
300,000 people watching me talk
about fighting a bear on Ari's.

3993
01:45:01,950 --> 01:45:02,400
What's,

3994
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,800
this is not happening now on youtube.

3995
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:09,570
I would venture to say not one person
woke up that morning after they saw that

3996
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:12,420
and went to comedy
central.com and then said,

3997
01:45:12,421 --> 01:45:12,601
hey,

3998
01:45:12,601 --> 01:45:13,291
check this out.

3999
01:45:13,291 --> 01:45:13,561
Swipe,

4000
01:45:13,561 --> 01:45:13,801
swipe,

4001
01:45:13,801 --> 01:45:14,550
swipe.

4002
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:15,383
This is Bert.

4003
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:16,373
They're not going to go there.

4004
01:45:17,290 --> 01:45:20,080
Did they understand that you
can get money from Youtube ads?

4005
01:45:20,110 --> 01:45:23,110
They just need to control
their own youtube channels
and then they could have it

4006
01:45:23,111 --> 01:45:26,410
on youtube and it would be on the comedy
central channel on Youtube and put all

4007
01:45:26,411 --> 01:45:29,140
their stuff up there and they would make
plenty of money and I don't think it

4008
01:45:29,141 --> 01:45:31,120
would cost them shit because
no one's paying for anything,

4009
01:45:31,121 --> 01:45:31,780
man.

4010
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:35,000
No one's paying for anything and not going
to pay for shows unless it's on apple

4011
01:45:35,001 --> 01:45:38,200
TV and you can just buy the whole season
like game of Thrones or something like

4012
01:45:38,201 --> 01:45:39,011
that and watch it.

4013
01:45:39,011 --> 01:45:40,840
Or like a show like walking dead.

4014
01:45:40,841 --> 01:45:44,140
I pay for the walking dead so I don't
have to watch those fucking commercials

4015
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:47,860
because I've made the mistake of
recording it on live TV and then trying to

4016
01:45:47,861 --> 01:45:50,290
watch it when I had been used
to watching it on an apple TV.

4017
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,400
It's unwatchable.

4018
01:45:51,730 --> 01:45:53,530
The fucking commercials are brutal.

4019
01:45:53,770 --> 01:45:58,720
Anytime something happens to fade to
black and a fucking dancing tied box comes

4020
01:45:58,721 --> 01:46:00,970
on the screen and it's horrible.

4021
01:46:00,971 --> 01:46:01,670
It's awful.

4022
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:04,300
Who's no commercial option
is awesome by the way.

4023
01:46:04,301 --> 01:46:05,350
It's like an extra five.

4024
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:05,831
Another thing,

4025
01:46:05,831 --> 01:46:09,730
Brian's being paid for comedy
central sponsored by Hulu.

4026
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:13,480
Some,

4027
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:14,080
it's,

4028
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:18,100
it's a new era and I think you're right
that a lot of people need to understand

4029
01:46:18,101 --> 01:46:19,840
that having things on youtube,

4030
01:46:19,870 --> 01:46:21,460
it doesn't take money away from you.

4031
01:46:21,461 --> 01:46:22,480
It makes your show bigger.

4032
01:46:22,990 --> 01:46:23,470
You know,

4033
01:46:23,470 --> 01:46:25,570
the more Ari has his content on Youtube,

4034
01:46:25,571 --> 01:46:27,550
the more it's going to make that
show bigger than more comedy.

4035
01:46:27,551 --> 01:46:28,780
Central's going to get more viewers,

4036
01:46:28,781 --> 01:46:31,630
the more ad dollars are going to make
is not taking any money away from them.

4037
01:46:31,631 --> 01:46:32,530
It's making it bigger.

4038
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:33,850
It's just gonna make a show bigger

4039
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:34,820
period.

4040
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:35,081
I mean,

4041
01:46:35,081 --> 01:46:35,914
think about,

4042
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:37,690
think about we,

4043
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:39,970
we've talked about this and
touch on this at certain times,

4044
01:46:39,971 --> 01:46:41,860
but the fact that we have
free content out there,

4045
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:44,470
the fact that I fucking three,

4046
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:48,490
four years ago told a story
on your podcast that changed
the scope of my career

4047
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,370
and I never make any money off that.

4048
01:46:50,371 --> 01:46:52,620
I don't make any money off of
the guys that have posted it.

4049
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:53,430
I don't,

4050
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:54,780
I don't give a fuck.

4051
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:55,530
I don't,

4052
01:46:55,530 --> 01:46:57,390
you'd think I look at become my minions.

4053
01:46:57,391 --> 01:46:58,021
Is the guy's name.

4054
01:46:58,021 --> 01:46:59,010
Do you think I looked at him and go,

4055
01:46:59,310 --> 01:47:00,570
go man,

4056
01:47:00,571 --> 01:47:01,860
he's making an ad dollars on this.

4057
01:47:01,861 --> 01:47:03,460
That guy was created
enough to create a car,

4058
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:03,960
a car,

4059
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:04,500
uh,

4060
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:08,670
a comic and add it to the story and
it got me people to come to my shows.

4061
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:09,680
That's all I give a fuck about.

4062
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:10,230
Yeah,

4063
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:11,160
it's free content,

4064
01:47:11,161 --> 01:47:11,250
man.

4065
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,230
That's why I'm doing the vlogs.

4066
01:47:12,231 --> 01:47:14,310
Just think about like comedy central,

4067
01:47:14,311 --> 01:47:17,490
how much money they spend on
advertising on billboards.

4068
01:47:17,491 --> 01:47:19,350
They had that giant
billboard above sunset,

4069
01:47:19,620 --> 01:47:21,060
that billboard above sunset,

4070
01:47:21,061 --> 01:47:21,930
above pink dot.

4071
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:27,090
Didn't get nearly as many people to
listen or watched our show as a youtube

4072
01:47:27,091 --> 01:47:28,800
video would don't even close.

4073
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:33,180
Here's what he's doing right now with
the storytelling is so fucking smart.

4074
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,141
It's so smart.

4075
01:47:34,141 --> 01:47:34,381
I've tried,

4076
01:47:34,381 --> 01:47:36,030
I've sold this to two people,

4077
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:36,340
mom,

4078
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:37,141
puppet by more than that.

4079
01:47:37,141 --> 01:47:38,670
But definitely to Orient Tommy.

4080
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:41,130
I'm jealous in the most
happy way for them.

4081
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:44,220
Like I'm so happy that they
did what they wanted to do.

4082
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:47,070
But that's what's interesting to me is
cause you're very successful right now.

4083
01:47:47,071 --> 01:47:50,820
But it seems like you look at what they're
doing and it looks like more fun to

4084
01:47:50,821 --> 01:47:51,750
you than what you're doing,

4085
01:47:51,751 --> 01:47:55,230
or it looks like something more
attractive to you than what you're doing.

4086
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,053
Uh,

4087
01:47:57,390 --> 01:47:58,950
that's why you're saying you're jealous.

4088
01:47:59,010 --> 01:47:59,551
I am jealous.

4089
01:47:59,551 --> 01:48:00,301
I'm definitely jealous.

4090
01:48:00,301 --> 01:48:00,501
Not,

4091
01:48:00,501 --> 01:48:00,720
not,

4092
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:01,110
but not,

4093
01:48:01,110 --> 01:48:03,260
I don't want people to associate
that with not a bad thing.

4094
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:03,511
No,

4095
01:48:03,511 --> 01:48:03,931
you're not.

4096
01:48:03,931 --> 01:48:04,980
You're not a petty guy.

4097
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,420
It's like you said one time you saw
Dave Chappelle ad at the comedy store

4098
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:09,360
working out and you got,

4099
01:48:09,390 --> 01:48:09,781
you got,

4100
01:48:09,781 --> 01:48:10,650
I don't know if you said jealous,

4101
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:12,780
but you said you got envious of his,

4102
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:15,000
of like how great he was
and you went home and wrote,

4103
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:15,541
well,

4104
01:48:15,541 --> 01:48:18,630
I would say it's inspired would
be the term that I would use.

4105
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:19,240
You know,

4106
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:20,580
I don't think it was a envious thing,

4107
01:48:20,581 --> 01:48:21,600
but it's certainly like,

4108
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:22,140
wow,

4109
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:22,471
God,

4110
01:48:22,471 --> 01:48:22,741
Tammy,

4111
01:48:22,741 --> 01:48:24,240
so good and you want to run home.

4112
01:48:24,241 --> 01:48:26,580
I don't like anybody can get envious.

4113
01:48:26,581 --> 01:48:28,680
We all can fall prey to that.

4114
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:31,140
Maybe I'm broad stroke and
then I don't let it in.

4115
01:48:31,141 --> 01:48:31,680
Man,

4116
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:32,430
I know what it is.

4117
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:33,031
I feel it.

4118
01:48:33,031 --> 01:48:33,864
I don't let it in.

4119
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:35,400
I recognized turn it the other way.

4120
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:35,941
I don't get it.

4121
01:48:35,941 --> 01:48:36,950
Like I don't like sit and go,

4122
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:37,231
God,

4123
01:48:37,231 --> 01:48:37,831
I fucking want that.

4124
01:48:37,831 --> 01:48:38,371
That's jealousy.

4125
01:48:38,371 --> 01:48:39,130
That's envy.

4126
01:48:39,130 --> 01:48:40,500
But I recognize that feeling.

4127
01:48:40,530 --> 01:48:41,820
I recognize that feeling of like,

4128
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:44,640
but we've all seen people
that do get that jealous,

4129
01:48:44,730 --> 01:48:45,211
envy,

4130
01:48:45,211 --> 01:48:45,931
angry thing.

4131
01:48:45,931 --> 01:48:46,200
It's,

4132
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:46,441
oh,

4133
01:48:46,441 --> 01:48:47,070
it's awful.

4134
01:48:47,070 --> 01:48:47,940
But I don't get that.

4135
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:50,760
What I get for with Ari and like big jail.

4136
01:48:50,770 --> 01:48:52,320
Kristen Big Jefferson did.

4137
01:48:52,321 --> 01:48:53,150
Uh,

4138
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:53,760
uh,

4139
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,480
uh,

4140
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:55,560
I went out to New York,

4141
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,420
uh,

4142
01:48:57,420 --> 01:48:57,901
to do,

4143
01:48:57,901 --> 01:49:00,880
it's a crowd work show
saw Crowdwork so he had,

4144
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:01,860
and it was a bunch of comics.

4145
01:49:01,861 --> 01:49:02,970
It was at the village underground.

4146
01:49:02,971 --> 01:49:03,721
It was fucking him or no,

4147
01:49:03,721 --> 01:49:04,110
it wasn't,

4148
01:49:04,110 --> 01:49:04,711
whatever it was.

4149
01:49:04,711 --> 01:49:05,544
I don't remember what it was,

4150
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:06,390
but it was great.

4151
01:49:06,390 --> 01:49:09,390
Bunch of rich Vos and I were on the
same show and I look at Jay and I,

4152
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:11,940
and I watched him do
crowd work and g big Jay,

4153
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:14,820
his crowd work is impeccable.

4154
01:49:15,630 --> 01:49:16,770
I do good crowd work.

4155
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,690
I'm a really good cow work Crowdwork guy.

4156
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:20,310
Not like big J.

4157
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:24,180
Big j can do it for a living for the rest
of his life and never write material.

4158
01:49:24,181 --> 01:49:25,290
He's that fucking good.

4159
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:28,200
He does it all the time to use Joe.

4160
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:28,921
I'm telling you,

4161
01:49:28,921 --> 01:49:30,270
watch big J do crowd work

4162
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:32,670
and like,

4163
01:49:32,670 --> 01:49:33,330
I don't know if you,

4164
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:34,440
I don't know how you do it the way I do,

4165
01:49:34,441 --> 01:49:35,500
but like I go to Kroger corn,

4166
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,353
I want to do it.

4167
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:37,710
I don't just do it all the time.

4168
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:38,520
Right.

4169
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:38,731
Man,

4170
01:49:38,731 --> 01:49:40,590
he fucking destroyed.

4171
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:41,510
And I,

4172
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:43,020
and I literally looked
at him and I was like,

4173
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,360
I was so enviously proud of him.

4174
01:49:45,361 --> 01:49:46,200
Like going big.

4175
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:46,840
You made you,

4176
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:48,100
you told your own show.

4177
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:49,570
You're doing just what I already did,

4178
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:51,820
but we crowd work what your thing is.

4179
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:53,440
And I look at those guys and you're right.

4180
01:49:53,441 --> 01:49:54,940
I think I do look at them and think,

4181
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:55,720
well,

4182
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,460
I know Ari's of different beast.

4183
01:49:57,580 --> 01:49:58,690
He answers to nobody.

4184
01:49:59,110 --> 01:50:01,450
He wants to do his own fucking thing
to take a year off from standup.

4185
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:01,931
He'll do it.

4186
01:50:01,931 --> 01:50:02,764
He didn't give a fuck.

4187
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:05,470
I'm envious of that and that in that like

4188
01:50:09,410 --> 01:50:09,790
it's good.

4189
01:50:09,790 --> 01:50:10,830
It's kind of beef.

4190
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:12,520
It's got to feel really
good to be untethered.

4191
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:13,090
Yeah.

4192
01:50:13,090 --> 01:50:13,510
Like to,

4193
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:14,343
to be like,

4194
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:15,460
you know what man,

4195
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:16,480
I got no fears.

4196
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:17,810
Not to say I,

4197
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:18,210
I'm,

4198
01:50:18,210 --> 01:50:19,330
I'm fucking filled with fears.

4199
01:50:19,331 --> 01:50:20,164
Everyone knows that.

4200
01:50:20,170 --> 01:50:22,030
But like I've got no fears,

4201
01:50:22,490 --> 01:50:22,610
uh,

4202
01:50:22,610 --> 01:50:23,443
do my thing.

4203
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:23,670
Uh,

4204
01:50:23,670 --> 01:50:24,250
I'll uh,

4205
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:24,820
and,

4206
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:25,653
and like I remember right,

4207
01:50:25,690 --> 01:50:28,300
like we were having a
conversation about notes,

4208
01:50:28,301 --> 01:50:32,100
comedy central's given and
Ari's take was well the wrong,

4209
01:50:32,730 --> 01:50:36,070
but just so impervious
to critique the wrong,

4210
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:37,023
I know what I'm doing,

4211
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:40,210
but just almost like Winston
Churchill like walking down the street

4212
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:42,670
problem when you have a vision for a show,

4213
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:45,760
then a bunch of people come along and
they have their own vision and they tried

4214
01:50:45,761 --> 01:50:49,210
to get the greasy little fingers on
your vision and change it and add their

4215
01:50:49,211 --> 01:50:50,830
little TJ's to the fucking soup.

4216
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:51,920
Yeah.

4217
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:52,130
It's,

4218
01:50:52,130 --> 01:50:52,591
and I told him,

4219
01:50:52,591 --> 01:50:53,160
I told him,

4220
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:56,550
I told him my notes did I just gotten
from the network from comedy central.

4221
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:57,150
Yeah.

4222
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:57,660
It was like,

4223
01:50:57,660 --> 01:50:58,493
don't do it.

4224
01:50:58,690 --> 01:50:59,730
But it was like I felt like going,

4225
01:50:59,850 --> 01:51:00,000
it's

4226
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,090
no good to do something that's your,

4227
01:51:02,130 --> 01:51:06,090
you collaborate creatively when you do
one of those things with people that

4228
01:51:06,091 --> 01:51:06,960
aren't creative.

4229
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:11,340
Like they might be creative but
they're not stand up comics.

4230
01:51:11,550 --> 01:51:13,890
So if they're telling a standup comic,

4231
01:51:13,891 --> 01:51:16,590
like you have a vision of what you want
it to be and they're telling you that

4232
01:51:16,591 --> 01:51:17,071
you're wrong,

4233
01:51:17,071 --> 01:51:18,090
you should do it a different way,

4234
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:19,710
that's going to be a disaster.

4235
01:51:19,860 --> 01:51:22,810
Every time I experienced
that on the man show we,

4236
01:51:22,890 --> 01:51:27,890
we got in the most fucking
insane arguments over
nonsense where Doug would come

4237
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:31,290
into the room pulling his
hair and you'd be like,

4238
01:51:31,291 --> 01:51:34,020
I can't fucking believe this is
something we're arguing over.

4239
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:34,741
Like,

4240
01:51:34,741 --> 01:51:35,461
and I would go,

4241
01:51:35,461 --> 01:51:36,211
what are they saying?

4242
01:51:36,211 --> 01:51:37,230
And he would tell me
what they were saying.

4243
01:51:37,710 --> 01:51:38,610
Well that can't be real.

4244
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:39,480
That's really what it is.

4245
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:39,991
One of them,

4246
01:51:39,991 --> 01:51:40,950
I think I've told this before,

4247
01:51:40,951 --> 01:51:43,470
but we had a game show
called make me hard.

4248
01:51:44,050 --> 01:51:45,600
We'd have a bunch of
different things happen.

4249
01:51:45,601 --> 01:51:48,390
The guy had a box over his dick with a
light would go on when he got a boner.

4250
01:51:48,391 --> 01:51:49,420
So we'd have like midgets eaten.

4251
01:51:49,421 --> 01:51:50,071
Banana is Ding,

4252
01:51:50,071 --> 01:51:50,221
Ding,

4253
01:51:50,221 --> 01:51:50,431
Ding.

4254
01:51:50,431 --> 01:51:50,611
You know,

4255
01:51:50,611 --> 01:51:51,391
it's really stupid.

4256
01:51:51,391 --> 01:51:52,590
But um,

4257
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:53,370
they didn't,

4258
01:51:53,370 --> 01:51:54,570
they wouldn't let us use hard.

4259
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:55,830
We had to call it stiff,

4260
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:57,570
uh,

4261
01:51:57,570 --> 01:51:58,710
crying argument,

4262
01:51:58,740 --> 01:51:59,573
like crying.

4263
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:00,240
Like it's,

4264
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:00,450
it's,

4265
01:52:00,450 --> 01:52:01,560
it's gone too far.

4266
01:52:01,561 --> 01:52:02,394
Like what,

4267
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:03,840
what is this?

4268
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:04,681
When Joey Diaz,

4269
01:52:04,681 --> 01:52:08,700
we had Joey Diaz introduce us and Joey
Diaz came out naked with timberlands on

4270
01:52:08,790 --> 01:52:10,140
let's get this party started.

4271
01:52:10,141 --> 01:52:11,610
That was the beginning of every episode.

4272
01:52:11,611 --> 01:52:12,444
That's what we wanted to do.

4273
01:52:12,570 --> 01:52:15,030
They were literally crying executives,

4274
01:52:15,031 --> 01:52:16,620
female executives crying.

4275
01:52:16,621 --> 01:52:18,150
How was that and pan show?

4276
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:18,630
How was it?

4277
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:19,560
How was that funny?

4278
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:22,230
It's not funny tears and I'm like,

4279
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:25,140
I can't even believe I'm
having this conversation.

4280
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:25,531
I go,

4281
01:52:25,531 --> 01:52:26,311
how about we do that?

4282
01:52:26,311 --> 01:52:27,270
So we did two ways.

4283
01:52:27,271 --> 01:52:27,511
I go,

4284
01:52:27,511 --> 01:52:28,710
we'll do the normal way first.

4285
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:30,420
We'll have them introduce us.

4286
01:52:30,450 --> 01:52:31,110
Normal.

4287
01:52:31,110 --> 01:52:32,400
I go and then we'll do it our way.

4288
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:32,821
We'll,

4289
01:52:32,821 --> 01:52:33,990
we'll Joe will come out naked.

4290
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:35,220
So we do the normal way.

4291
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:35,461
All right,

4292
01:52:35,461 --> 01:52:36,091
we're going to do a second.

4293
01:52:36,091 --> 01:52:36,950
Take the,

4294
01:52:36,951 --> 01:52:37,260
the,

4295
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:40,020
he fucking kicked the door up
and let's get this party started.

4296
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:41,610
They go ape shit.

4297
01:52:41,611 --> 01:52:43,170
People are falling out of their chairs.

4298
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:44,790
It's hilarious.

4299
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:45,411
You know,

4300
01:52:45,411 --> 01:52:46,370
and he introduces

4301
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:46,850
us,

4302
01:52:46,850 --> 01:52:48,800
Doug Stein home and Joe,

4303
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:49,733
Oh God.

4304
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:50,990
And the place goes ape shit.

4305
01:52:50,991 --> 01:52:52,370
The fucking room changes.

4306
01:52:52,371 --> 01:52:53,420
And I looked at the lady,

4307
01:52:53,421 --> 01:52:54,254
I went,

4308
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,580
see that's funny.

4309
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,050
Like don't tell me what's funny.

4310
01:52:57,051 --> 01:52:57,680
He might,

4311
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:58,640
you don't think it's funny.

4312
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:00,800
You want everything to be all clever.

4313
01:53:00,801 --> 01:53:04,250
Like it would work really great at
the UCB and everybody would golf clap.

4314
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:05,480
That's bullshit.

4315
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:11,080
You want props for putting together
a really smart and diverse show.

4316
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:13,220
Like that's not what we're here to do.

4317
01:53:13,221 --> 01:53:16,910
We're here to just make the shit that
we think is going to be the funniest.

4318
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:18,440
And we can't do that with you.

4319
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:19,910
You're an albatross,

4320
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,140
you're a bundle of wood,

4321
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:22,040
you're a burden.

4322
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:22,873
Some woman,

4323
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:25,291
that's a burden.

4324
01:53:25,291 --> 01:53:26,124
Some woman,

4325
01:53:26,270 --> 01:53:28,700
100% and it didn't,

4326
01:53:28,701 --> 01:53:29,990
it just so happened that she was a woman.

4327
01:53:29,991 --> 01:53:30,920
It was a guy that was crying.

4328
01:53:30,921 --> 01:53:31,754
I would smack him.

4329
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:34,100
Jesus Christ.

4330
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:35,513
Yeah,

4331
01:53:35,530 --> 01:53:36,231
the I think,

4332
01:53:36,231 --> 01:53:36,560
I dunno.

4333
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:37,100
Yeah,

4334
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:38,060
that's not good.

4335
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:42,980
That's why the youtube option is the best
option or an online option is the best

4336
01:53:42,981 --> 01:53:43,700
option.

4337
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:47,000
That's why podcasts are so superior,

4338
01:53:47,001 --> 01:53:50,300
a form of expression than anything
you're ever going to find on network

4339
01:53:50,301 --> 01:53:53,450
television because whether
it's good or whether it's bad,

4340
01:53:53,451 --> 01:53:55,310
it's ultimately all coming from you.

4341
01:53:55,311 --> 01:53:56,180
100%.

4342
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:56,630
Dude,

4343
01:53:56,630 --> 01:53:57,040
you,

4344
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:57,680
uh,

4345
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:57,981
uh,

4346
01:53:57,981 --> 01:53:59,330
we had this conversation another day,

4347
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:00,193
but the,

4348
01:54:00,650 --> 01:54:01,483
um,

4349
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:03,050
creating your own content,

4350
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:07,130
putting your own content out there and
making her own content despite what you

4351
01:54:07,131 --> 01:54:08,330
may believe your content is.

4352
01:54:08,331 --> 01:54:09,230
I woke up this morning,

4353
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,720
I got a text tweet from
some guy and he was like,

4354
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:12,231
hey man,

4355
01:54:12,231 --> 01:54:13,370
I haven't had a bird cast it a week,

4356
01:54:13,371 --> 01:54:13,521
like,

4357
01:54:13,521 --> 01:54:14,354
what's going on?

4358
01:54:14,570 --> 01:54:15,070
And I was like,

4359
01:54:15,070 --> 01:54:15,290
ah,

4360
01:54:15,290 --> 01:54:15,741
fuck it.

4361
01:54:15,741 --> 01:54:16,820
And I hit like,

4362
01:54:16,821 --> 01:54:17,100
you know,

4363
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:17,390
uh,

4364
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:18,051
I'll get on it.

4365
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:18,980
I'm doing Rogan today.

4366
01:54:18,981 --> 01:54:19,814
Enjoy that.

4367
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:20,810
And then all of a sudden I was like,

4368
01:54:20,811 --> 01:54:21,411
fuck it man.

4369
01:54:21,411 --> 01:54:23,450
I can get up and go to the man
cave and banging on a podcast,

4370
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:24,500
get up,

4371
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,880
fucking start talking,

4372
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:27,410
incorporate my vlog.

4373
01:54:27,411 --> 01:54:27,770
Go Out,

4374
01:54:27,770 --> 01:54:29,300
get the girls donuts podcast,

4375
01:54:29,390 --> 01:54:30,080
the whole thing.

4376
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:35,000
Talk to the people at [inaudible] and
it's like you're creating your own content

4377
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:35,740
is,

4378
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:39,890
is being the owner of your own
shit is where the future is.

4379
01:54:40,130 --> 01:54:40,581
It is,

4380
01:54:40,581 --> 01:54:45,320
but there are places that will let you
do your thing and that's where Netflix is

4381
01:54:45,321 --> 01:54:45,880
right now.

4382
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:46,140
Yeah.

4383
01:54:46,140 --> 01:54:47,000
He'll bird just,

4384
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:50,510
he has a show coming out December
18th it's calledF is for family.

4385
01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:53,360
His experience with them has been amazing.

4386
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:56,420
And him talking about his experience
with them and creating that show,

4387
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:57,141
he's like,

4388
01:54:57,141 --> 01:54:58,220
they left me alone.

4389
01:54:58,280 --> 01:54:58,641
You know,

4390
01:54:58,641 --> 01:54:58,801
they,

4391
01:54:58,801 --> 01:55:01,220
they just let me do the
best show that I could do.

4392
01:55:01,221 --> 01:55:02,960
He brought on a bunch of great people,

4393
01:55:02,961 --> 01:55:04,080
great voice actors,

4394
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:04,933
great writers,

4395
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:06,760
and he put together this fucking bang,

4396
01:55:06,761 --> 01:55:08,840
an animated show that's
going to be killer.

4397
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:11,330
It just let him be himself.

4398
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:12,560
They let him do his thing.

4399
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:16,760
They feel they're fucking getting it
and they're [inaudible] how soon until

4400
01:55:16,761 --> 01:55:17,270
they,

4401
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:22,270
how soon until they get so recognized
that that fucking 2020 does a piece on

4402
01:55:23,721 --> 01:55:28,520
Netflix taking over public television or
regular television and then exact start

4403
01:55:28,521 --> 01:55:29,750
flooding into next flicks.

4404
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:32,540
And now it just becomes
that from comedy central,

4405
01:55:32,541 --> 01:55:33,890
from NBC,

4406
01:55:33,891 --> 01:55:34,800
from those e.

4407
01:55:34,801 --> 01:55:37,760
The real problem is those people
that were in the original networks,

4408
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:39,050
those dinosaurs,

4409
01:55:39,051 --> 01:55:42,590
those motherfuckers on
CBS and NBC and ABC,

4410
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:44,070
they're with soap

4411
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:47,850
operas there dealing with nonsense
to dealing with the fucking,

4412
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:50,460
the multi camera shoot sitcoms.

4413
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:51,650
Ha.

4414
01:55:51,790 --> 01:55:52,380
You know.

4415
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:56,310
Well who could possibly do that
door cakes in whoop prat fall.

4416
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:58,860
Oh it's Kramer.

4417
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:01,920
You know what somebody did the other day,

4418
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:02,970
somebody put out,

4419
01:56:02,990 --> 01:56:03,450
um,

4420
01:56:03,450 --> 01:56:08,030
a bunch of outtakes from Seinfeld and
you got to see like we're [inaudible]

4421
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:08,580
Kramer.

4422
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:12,360
Oh he fucking sizzled.

4423
01:56:12,361 --> 01:56:14,130
If anyone was like laughing,

4424
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:15,083
he would be like,

4425
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:16,313
oh my God.

4426
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,240
He was a hated working on news radio,

4427
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:19,261
news radio.

4428
01:56:19,261 --> 01:56:20,041
We fucking like,

4429
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:24,660
I did a scene with Andy Dick where I
think we probably broke like 10 times.

4430
01:56:24,661 --> 01:56:28,050
It was there like 10 times to get
through it because Andy was so funny.

4431
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:29,430
Like we do the things I would,

4432
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:30,870
I would bite myself,

4433
01:56:30,930 --> 01:56:33,390
I'd bite the inside of
my mouth to get to hurt.

4434
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:34,530
So I wouldn't laugh.

4435
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:37,320
I would do all sorts of different
things so that I wouldn't crack up.

4436
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:38,290
But you,

4437
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:38,670
you're going to,

4438
01:56:38,670 --> 01:56:39,630
if it's a funny show,

4439
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:40,170
you're gonna,

4440
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:41,003
you're gonna Laugh.

4441
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,290
I could've never done news radio.

4442
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:43,180
I was watching the videos.

4443
01:56:43,181 --> 01:56:45,090
It's looked like he didn't
give a fuck about the scene.

4444
01:56:45,091 --> 01:56:49,800
He was waiting for his moment and he's
waiting for his time to come in and shine

4445
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:51,270
and he didn't care that,

4446
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:52,120
you know,

4447
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:55,290
with Julia Louise Dreyfus and
Jerry Seinfeld for laughing,

4448
01:56:55,291 --> 01:56:57,120
they're all laughing and yucking it up.

4449
01:56:57,210 --> 01:56:58,410
He didn't want to be a part of that.

4450
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,060
He just wanted to do his thing.

4451
01:57:00,190 --> 01:57:01,023
Yup.

4452
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:02,220
If you watch it,

4453
01:57:02,221 --> 01:57:03,910
you watch him just go and like,

4454
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:05,190
not even joking like,

4455
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:06,000
oh,

4456
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:06,810
stop it.

4457
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:07,643
Stop it.

4458
01:57:07,770 --> 01:57:09,060
You're ruining this.

4459
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:12,630
Like he fucking seems like they
all had some weird things going on.

4460
01:57:12,631 --> 01:57:16,230
Like George George's wife who died
in this show died because they,

4461
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:16,800
she,

4462
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:17,670
he didn't like her,

4463
01:57:17,730 --> 01:57:18,720
like acting with her.

4464
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:19,261
He's like,

4465
01:57:19,261 --> 01:57:20,094
she sucks.

4466
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:21,150
So they killed her off.

4467
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:21,720
Really?

4468
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:22,320
Yeah.

4469
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:24,060
I should have that is possible though,

4470
01:57:24,061 --> 01:57:24,391
man.

4471
01:57:24,391 --> 01:57:27,310
You could have a husband or a wife
on a show and the there are a Goddamn

4472
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:29,190
nightmare and you're
stuck with those people.

4473
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:30,840
That's a five years,

4474
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:31,201
dude.

4475
01:57:31,201 --> 01:57:32,370
That's a real problem.

4476
01:57:32,371 --> 01:57:36,720
I had a friend who did a sitcom and he
had like a girlfriend on a sitcom that

4477
01:57:36,721 --> 01:57:37,270
was supposed to be,

4478
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:37,711
and he was like,

4479
01:57:37,711 --> 01:57:38,910
I fucking hate her.

4480
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:41,220
Like she's so she's such a cunt,

4481
01:57:41,490 --> 01:57:41,761
like,

4482
01:57:41,761 --> 01:57:42,870
and he didn't know what to do.

4483
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,070
Fortunately it didn't last.

4484
01:57:44,071 --> 01:57:45,120
But they,

4485
01:57:45,150 --> 01:57:47,160
they have issues like that and you can,

4486
01:57:47,161 --> 01:57:48,340
you could run into issues like,

4487
01:57:48,390 --> 01:57:50,340
and also people change with success.

4488
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:53,670
Like the show starts getting really
good and then they want a lot of money.

4489
01:57:53,850 --> 01:57:54,480
I've heard,

4490
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:59,070
I've heard those crazy stories of people
coming in to renegotiate and plopping

4491
01:57:59,071 --> 01:58:02,790
their feet up on the executives desks
and just letting them know they're the

4492
01:58:02,791 --> 01:58:03,930
center of the show.

4493
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:05,010
I'll never be that guy.

4494
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:06,240
I know those guys,

4495
01:58:06,241 --> 01:58:06,571
man.

4496
01:58:06,571 --> 01:58:11,250
I know a guy who got his
whole show canceled because
he said some nasty shit to

4497
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:12,780
an executive that was a woman.

4498
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:14,660
He literally said the,

4499
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:14,821
the,

4500
01:58:14,821 --> 01:58:14,941
the,

4501
01:58:14,941 --> 01:58:16,710
the to paraphrase,

4502
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:17,933
um,

4503
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:22,650
I am the creative genius behind
the show and you are a dumb cunt.

4504
01:58:23,390 --> 01:58:24,480
That was his words.

4505
01:58:24,570 --> 01:58:25,080
Wow.

4506
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:25,591
And they went,

4507
01:58:25,591 --> 01:58:26,430
that's a wrap.

4508
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:29,940
They cancel the show the next day and he
was only like a few episodes away from

4509
01:58:29,941 --> 01:58:30,774
syndication.

4510
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:32,550
You'll never see that show in syndication.

4511
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:33,451
I can't,

4512
01:58:33,451 --> 01:58:35,670
I'll tell you after the
show's over afterwards over,

4513
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:36,533
I'll tell you,

4514
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:37,590
I don't want to shit on the guy,

4515
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:40,260
but it's a publicly known that he's,

4516
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:40,770
you know,

4517
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:41,603
he's insane.

4518
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:41,990
But the,

4519
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:45,760
I think it's also like why did you
become an actor in the first place?

4520
01:58:45,761 --> 01:58:48,280
Why did you become a standup
for a lot of people's,

4521
01:58:48,281 --> 01:58:53,281
they want validation because they were
rejected and they have this hole in their

4522
01:58:53,321 --> 01:58:54,154
soul.

4523
01:58:54,310 --> 01:58:56,730
They need to fill up with
love and intention and they,

4524
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:58,930
they didn't get enough of it
when they were developing.

4525
01:58:58,931 --> 01:59:01,540
So they have this overwhelming mall.

4526
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:02,591
There's a need,

4527
01:59:02,591 --> 01:59:07,591
there's a gaping volcano
that just swallows couches
and more and they just need

4528
01:59:08,651 --> 01:59:09,210
attention.

4529
01:59:09,210 --> 01:59:10,630
He can't fill that fucker up.

4530
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:14,860
And then once they get what they always
wanted and they're still not happy,

4531
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:18,010
they don't know what the fuck to do
and a lot of them become tyrants.

4532
01:59:18,730 --> 01:59:19,570
But here's the problem.

4533
01:59:20,290 --> 01:59:21,123
I don't think I,

4534
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:26,190
what percentage of that group do you
think does that that cause I got a little

4535
01:59:26,411 --> 01:59:28,750
bit of that fucking sink hole.

4536
01:59:29,410 --> 01:59:30,250
Like I'm a stand up.

4537
01:59:30,290 --> 01:59:32,450
I bloody does goal.

4538
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:33,940
That's what gets you into the game.

4539
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:34,960
I have no interest in,

4540
01:59:34,961 --> 01:59:36,590
and we were talking about
this before you walked in.

4541
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:38,500
I have no interest in um,

4542
01:59:38,710 --> 01:59:39,990
propaganda or,

4543
01:59:39,991 --> 01:59:41,380
or being famous,

4544
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:43,780
being famous for the sake of being famous.

4545
01:59:43,781 --> 01:59:46,180
Although I'll fuck around
with the concept of it.

4546
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:47,193
I have no like,

4547
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:48,760
I don't want to be Kim Kardashian.

4548
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:49,001
I'd,

4549
01:59:49,001 --> 01:59:50,810
I'd rather be a respected stand up.

4550
01:59:50,890 --> 01:59:54,670
So what's the difference then
between that fucking that,

4551
01:59:54,730 --> 01:59:55,401
that sinkhole,

4552
01:59:55,401 --> 01:59:56,770
that sucking in all,

4553
01:59:57,190 --> 02:00:01,780
all of you versus like us guys
who I really love the art form.

4554
02:00:01,781 --> 02:00:02,614
I really love

4555
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:07,310
differences between like
Larry David and Kramer,

4556
02:00:07,730 --> 02:00:08,840
like Larry David.

4557
02:00:08,870 --> 02:00:09,890
Is it creative,

4558
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:11,270
brilliant man.

4559
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:12,260
And he's genius.

4560
02:00:12,261 --> 02:00:14,990
That show curb your
enthusiasm is fucking genius.

4561
02:00:15,290 --> 02:00:19,700
And it's all him poking fun at himself
and finding the best possible comedic

4562
02:00:19,701 --> 02:00:20,660
angle of everything.

4563
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:21,890
It's hilarious.

4564
02:00:22,070 --> 02:00:24,020
He's always the loser in every episode.

4565
02:00:24,021 --> 02:00:24,381
I mean it's,

4566
02:00:24,381 --> 02:00:24,621
it's,

4567
02:00:24,621 --> 02:00:25,431
it's God damn.

4568
02:00:25,431 --> 02:00:26,270
It's a brilliant,

4569
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:31,300
brilliant show and he by all accounts is
a very level guy like very intelligent

4570
02:00:33,321 --> 02:00:34,011
is not need.

4571
02:00:34,011 --> 02:00:37,730
He just wants to do the best
work he can do and brilliant.

4572
02:00:38,150 --> 02:00:38,930
Brilliant.

4573
02:00:38,930 --> 02:00:39,920
Absolutely brilliant.

4574
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:43,220
That's the difference between a guy
like him and a guy like Kramer and my

4575
02:00:43,221 --> 02:00:46,780
thoughts on Kramer only from watching
him do stand up because I was there.

4576
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:47,540
It was terrible.

4577
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:50,030
I wasn't a guy that was into
Seinfeld for whatever reason.

4578
02:00:50,031 --> 02:00:50,960
I never watched that show.

4579
02:00:50,961 --> 02:00:54,110
I only watched a couple episodes
of it ever and it was a good show.

4580
02:00:54,350 --> 02:00:56,780
It's just there was only so
many things you can watch,

4581
02:00:56,810 --> 02:01:00,260
you know and you get when you have
south park or married with children or

4582
02:01:00,261 --> 02:01:02,630
whatever the fuck it is on your
plate that you watch a lot of,

4583
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:04,010
you can only watch so many shows.

4584
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:04,971
For whatever reason.

4585
02:01:04,971 --> 02:01:06,860
Seinfeld wasn't the show
that I watched all the time,

4586
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:09,860
although the ones that I did watch
were always really hilarious,

4587
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:14,990
but I got to see him do standup at
the store and he was fucking awful.

4588
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:20,330
It was like a guy who had nothing prepared
and just went up there with like a

4589
02:01:20,331 --> 02:01:23,870
reputation and some pratfalls
and it didn't make any sense.

4590
02:01:24,140 --> 02:01:26,120
Like it wasn't like he was
trying to work out some bits.

4591
02:01:26,330 --> 02:01:29,690
Like you'll see a guy come in and try to
work out some shit and like even like a

4592
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:32,450
famous person will come in like a Paul
riser or something like that will come

4593
02:01:32,451 --> 02:01:35,180
into a club and they'll
try to work out some shit.

4594
02:01:36,150 --> 02:01:36,420
Son.

4595
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:37,820
When he was doing and we use,

4596
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:38,371
we was doing,

4597
02:01:38,371 --> 02:01:38,870
it was just,

4598
02:01:38,870 --> 02:01:40,070
didn't make any sense.

4599
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:42,800
I saw him at the Improv
like the weekend before,

4600
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:46,700
the weekend before the disaster
disaster and it was an uncomfortable,

4601
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:47,870
it was bad.

4602
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:48,860
Like you literally,

4603
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:52,310
he felony lander on his
glass and broke his class.

4604
02:01:52,311 --> 02:01:54,740
Like he did like a prat fall
and broke his glasses and all,

4605
02:01:54,741 --> 02:01:55,401
I remember thinking this,

4606
02:01:55,401 --> 02:01:56,390
did he just cut his hip?

4607
02:01:56,420 --> 02:02:00,530
Like is he going to be bleeding
now or it was like legit falls.

4608
02:02:01,490 --> 02:02:02,030
Uh,

4609
02:02:02,030 --> 02:02:02,500
I dunno.

4610
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:02,611
Yeah.

4611
02:02:02,611 --> 02:02:04,490
I called Joe up that night and Mike,

4612
02:02:04,491 --> 02:02:06,980
you got to see Kramer's
on stage right now.

4613
02:02:06,981 --> 02:02:10,430
He's acting all fucked up like
he seems like he's on something.

4614
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:15,380
He's with some girl that she's
wasted two and then he got offstage,

4615
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:16,310
went to laugh factory.

4616
02:02:16,311 --> 02:02:17,144
It all happened.

4617
02:02:17,150 --> 02:02:19,640
Jamie ran across the street
with TMZ with the video.

4618
02:02:21,170 --> 02:02:22,430
Bret Ernst was there,

4619
02:02:23,410 --> 02:02:25,270
came over to the store after,

4620
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:28,550
cause I got there at the comedy store
right after he had gone wacky at the

4621
02:02:28,551 --> 02:02:31,600
comedy store and there was a buzz around
and Brian called me up and bunch of

4622
02:02:31,601 --> 02:02:33,770
other people were talking about
how fucking coked up he was.

4623
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:37,880
And so then he went down the laugh factory
and had his meltdown and Brent earns

4624
02:02:37,881 --> 02:02:38,740
was there and saw it.

4625
02:02:38,770 --> 02:02:39,760
He came back to the story.

4626
02:02:39,770 --> 02:02:40,041
He's like,

4627
02:02:40,041 --> 02:02:40,341
Yo,

4628
02:02:40,341 --> 02:02:40,960
you ain't going to boot.

4629
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:42,380
You know Brett hurt Fred talks.

4630
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:43,071
He was like,

4631
02:02:43,071 --> 02:02:43,281
Yo,

4632
02:02:43,281 --> 02:02:45,990
you ain't gonna believe how
fucking crazy Kramer God,

4633
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:51,000
the laced Adidas with the fucking full
tracksuit on dropping bombs like a

4634
02:02:52,311 --> 02:02:53,001
motherfucker.

4635
02:02:53,001 --> 02:02:53,301
I go,

4636
02:02:53,301 --> 02:02:53,990
no.

4637
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:54,411
He goes,

4638
02:02:54,411 --> 02:02:54,720
all,

4639
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:55,553
yeah,

4640
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:58,760
these black kids were heckling him
and he starts dropping n bombs.

4641
02:02:58,761 --> 02:02:59,091
And I'm like,

4642
02:02:59,091 --> 02:02:59,924
no.

4643
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:00,231
I like,

4644
02:03:00,231 --> 02:03:00,381
yeah,

4645
02:03:00,381 --> 02:03:00,640
I go,

4646
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:01,161
was it funny?

4647
02:03:01,161 --> 02:03:01,490
He goes,

4648
02:03:01,490 --> 02:03:02,590
no,

4649
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:03,321
no.

4650
02:03:03,321 --> 02:03:04,310
It wasn't funny.

4651
02:03:04,530 --> 02:03:05,030
He was like,

4652
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:06,170
it's funny now

4653
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:12,940
and then Monday it hit and it was the
first instance of a video of someone kept

4654
02:03:14,331 --> 02:03:18,800
being captured doing something like crazy
like that and then putting it on the

4655
02:03:18,801 --> 02:03:21,590
Internet and it just ruining
that person destroying them.

4656
02:03:21,710 --> 02:03:21,831
Yeah.

4657
02:03:21,831 --> 02:03:23,540
Here's the night when I called you.

4658
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:26,060
That's what I think the baby phase,

4659
02:03:26,061 --> 02:03:27,240
Bryan Kramer,

4660
02:03:27,241 --> 02:03:28,074
Caesar.

4661
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:29,030
That's hilarious.

4662
02:03:29,031 --> 02:03:29,600
Babyface,

4663
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:30,770
Brian and Kramer.

4664
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:32,343
Uh,

4665
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:33,190
that was the first.

4666
02:03:33,190 --> 02:03:33,490
So,

4667
02:03:33,490 --> 02:03:34,220
so true.

4668
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:35,053
See if you can,

4669
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:39,770
what are the top five instances of cameras
coming out of this at a comedy club

4670
02:03:40,040 --> 02:03:44,060
that a comic that had
to do a Monday morning,

4671
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:45,103
Mia Copa.

4672
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:47,320
Cause you got Kramer,

4673
02:03:47,730 --> 02:03:48,620
who is the other ones?

4674
02:03:48,650 --> 02:03:51,890
We got tosh but Taj didn't
really do a mia culpa.

4675
02:03:51,891 --> 02:03:52,410
He even,

4676
02:03:52,410 --> 02:03:53,240
he even him,

4677
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,110
his apology,

4678
02:03:54,111 --> 02:03:54,471
first of all,

4679
02:03:54,471 --> 02:03:55,970
that woman did not record it.

4680
02:03:55,971 --> 02:03:56,990
No one recorded it.

4681
02:03:57,140 --> 02:04:00,560
That's part of the problem was her
version of the facts were completely

4682
02:04:00,561 --> 02:04:01,160
distorted.

4683
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:01,670
So then you,

4684
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:02,570
you disregard,

4685
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:06,530
she wrote a whole blog about her
heckling and his response to her heckled.

4686
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:07,730
That's essentially what happened.

4687
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:08,360
But,

4688
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:10,170
but he acknowledged that he did.

4689
02:04:10,190 --> 02:04:11,001
He definitely acknowledge it,

4690
02:04:11,001 --> 02:04:13,460
but it was right there.

4691
02:04:14,330 --> 02:04:14,810
Like,

4692
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:15,910
here's the here and I'll,

4693
02:04:15,911 --> 02:04:17,570
I'll try to whittle it down to this.

4694
02:04:17,870 --> 02:04:22,870
What is the difference then between like
Daniel Tosh and Tracy Morgan and Patton

4695
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:23,910
Oswald,

4696
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:28,910
acknowledging there they're
getting fucking blogged
about versus Michael Kramer.

4697
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:31,940
Is it the fear,

4698
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:32,930
the culture of fear?

4699
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:35,360
What did Patton Oswald do?

4700
02:04:35,450 --> 02:04:36,410
Cotton Oswald,

4701
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:37,883
uh,

4702
02:04:37,910 --> 02:04:38,340
someone

4703
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:42,630
was videotaping and when he yelled
at her at the whatchamacallit and,

4704
02:04:42,631 --> 02:04:43,464
uh,

4705
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:45,390
and he said,

4706
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:46,201
shut up.

4707
02:04:46,201 --> 02:04:48,990
And then he kicked her out and he was
a dick to her and then she had to leave

4708
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:51,930
and then he had to just
someone Google Patton Oswald.

4709
02:04:51,950 --> 02:04:52,250
Man,

4710
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:52,881
we don't need to.

4711
02:04:52,881 --> 02:04:53,330
We don't do,

4712
02:04:53,330 --> 02:04:53,791
it's okay.

4713
02:04:53,791 --> 02:04:54,230
Yeah.

4714
02:04:54,230 --> 02:04:54,531
Yeah.

4715
02:04:54,531 --> 02:04:57,170
I think patent Jamie and cut my camera.

4716
02:04:57,440 --> 02:04:58,610
Cut The camera.

4717
02:04:58,970 --> 02:05:03,290
Bert Kreischer smoking
marijuana caught screen camera.

4718
02:05:04,430 --> 02:05:04,851
This is,

4719
02:05:04,851 --> 02:05:05,480
um,

4720
02:05:05,480 --> 02:05:06,340
as Joey Diaz was,

4721
02:05:06,341 --> 02:05:06,500
hey,

4722
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:07,340
this is not pedophile.

4723
02:05:07,341 --> 02:05:08,480
Small town with the church.

4724
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:09,741
So yeah,

4725
02:05:09,741 --> 02:05:09,940
but,

4726
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:10,610
but like,

4727
02:05:10,610 --> 02:05:13,500
so I count Tracy Morgan and Patton
Oswald and Daniel Tosh and the,

4728
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:15,020
and the Michael Kramer Shit,

4729
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:16,113
right.

4730
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:17,820
Dave Chappelle has a,

4731
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:20,130
maybe have it as a solution to all this.

4732
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:20,610
Well,

4733
02:05:20,610 --> 02:05:22,230
Hannibal came up with a solution first.

4734
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:24,480
He started using it after
the bill Cosby thing.

4735
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:25,973
That bag,

4736
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:29,370
you can give a bag to people and they
put their cell phones in it so they can't

4737
02:05:29,371 --> 02:05:32,130
record while they're in there and
they saw but how many fucking,

4738
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:33,060
what if they have a cell phone?

4739
02:05:33,061 --> 02:05:33,894
Their sock,

4740
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,700
you're gonna check their
whole body or cell phones.

4741
02:05:35,701 --> 02:05:38,730
I think like they're talking about big
theaters that Chappelle would be and

4742
02:05:38,731 --> 02:05:39,720
where they would have the,

4743
02:05:39,721 --> 02:05:39,991
you know,

4744
02:05:39,991 --> 02:05:43,980
the security that the metal detectors
you have to has metal detectors at

4745
02:05:43,990 --> 02:05:44,570
theaters.

4746
02:05:44,570 --> 02:05:44,851
You know,

4747
02:05:44,851 --> 02:05:45,631
UFC has,

4748
02:05:45,631 --> 02:05:45,870
I'm like,

4749
02:05:45,870 --> 02:05:47,740
I'll have them in big theaters nowadays.

4750
02:05:47,910 --> 02:05:48,930
Arena though,

4751
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:50,910
most of the theaters that we perform it,

4752
02:05:50,911 --> 02:05:54,120
like if I perform at a place that's
got 3000 seats or something like that,

4753
02:05:54,121 --> 02:05:56,040
they don't have metal detectors do that.

4754
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:57,320
Have you ever walked through the door,

4755
02:05:57,350 --> 02:05:58,110
walk to the door?

4756
02:05:58,110 --> 02:05:59,620
He denied a second ego.

4757
02:06:00,550 --> 02:06:01,470
Ego's a death metal,

4758
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:01,651
you know,

4759
02:06:01,651 --> 02:06:03,720
that that kind of arena
place probably has,

4760
02:06:03,721 --> 02:06:03,961
you know,

4761
02:06:03,961 --> 02:06:05,340
security and stuff like that.

4762
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:06,181
I'm much time do we have left?

4763
02:06:06,181 --> 02:06:07,270
Do I have another time for another drink?

4764
02:06:07,290 --> 02:06:07,710
Yeah.

4765
02:06:07,710 --> 02:06:08,210
Fuck yeah.

4766
02:06:08,210 --> 02:06:08,821
I want him to drink.

4767
02:06:08,821 --> 02:06:10,140
It's only four o'clock oh,

4768
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:11,730
perfect bird.

4769
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:16,290
Malvo fucking bird was saying that he
got to a point where he was drinking

4770
02:06:16,620 --> 02:06:17,720
about fucking Brian.

4771
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:20,270
I told you when I said
that these are secrets.

4772
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:20,511
No,

4773
02:06:20,511 --> 02:06:21,320
I didn't say that.

4774
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:22,190
I didn't say the rest of it.

4775
02:06:22,210 --> 02:06:22,380
Yeah,

4776
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:23,680
you started stupid.

4777
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:28,750
Jamie fucking jump in secret secrets
are no fun and I said that was a secret.

4778
02:06:29,570 --> 02:06:29,841
I said,

4779
02:06:29,841 --> 02:06:33,440
I don't like to share everything because
sometimes I wasn't going to say that.

4780
02:06:35,060 --> 02:06:38,390
And bonds are too honest and they
don't go like they don't like,

4781
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:41,390
like all you guys are very honest.

4782
02:06:41,391 --> 02:06:41,690
You don't,

4783
02:06:41,690 --> 02:06:42,150
you don't have that.

4784
02:06:42,150 --> 02:06:43,470
You have my wife's thing if you want to,

4785
02:06:43,471 --> 02:06:44,650
if you want to feel better about yourself,

4786
02:06:44,690 --> 02:06:46,100
talk to Jamie and fucking Brian.

4787
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,380
If you want to hear the
truth and the brutal truth,

4788
02:06:48,381 --> 02:06:49,190
talk to you.

4789
02:06:49,190 --> 02:06:50,720
Joey are your fucking buns.

4790
02:06:51,110 --> 02:06:51,950
And so yes,

4791
02:06:51,951 --> 02:06:56,510
I was getting to a point
where I was drinking a thing
of not a handle of Tito's,

4792
02:06:56,511 --> 02:06:58,430
but a bottle of Tito's
at night on the road.

4793
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:00,260
That wasn't when I was
was going to say that.

4794
02:07:00,261 --> 02:07:01,094
You say

4795
02:07:03,590 --> 02:07:06,620
that is what at least full shit.

4796
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:08,330
Yeah.

4797
02:07:08,330 --> 02:07:12,440
So and also at the fucking Doug Stan
hope lump in my stomach or a lump

4798
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:14,230
like a hernia.

4799
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:14,591
Yeah,

4800
02:07:14,591 --> 02:07:15,400
I think so.

4801
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:16,510
Does it like when you,

4802
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:17,560
you flex,

4803
02:07:17,590 --> 02:07:18,070
does your,

4804
02:07:18,070 --> 02:07:19,600
your intestines pop out?

4805
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:20,693
Yeah,

4806
02:07:20,770 --> 02:07:21,603
I got fixed.

4807
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:22,421
I know I can,

4808
02:07:22,421 --> 02:07:23,320
it's not that big a deal.

4809
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:24,790
I don't know if it's facts.

4810
02:07:24,791 --> 02:07:25,810
I'm so fat right now.

4811
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:26,950
I don't know if it's,

4812
02:07:27,730 --> 02:07:28,563
how does it poke out?

4813
02:07:28,870 --> 02:07:29,500
I uh,

4814
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:34,300
I tried sitting up in bed to the day
and I just noticed that my stomach,

4815
02:07:34,990 --> 02:07:35,781
I had like what?

4816
02:07:35,781 --> 02:07:36,030
It looked

4817
02:07:36,030 --> 02:07:37,990
like a sale in my center,

4818
02:07:37,991 --> 02:07:38,481
my stomach.

4819
02:07:38,481 --> 02:07:39,314
So I was like,

4820
02:07:39,850 --> 02:07:42,250
and I know dog showed it to me.

4821
02:07:42,290 --> 02:07:45,130
Sale tags got like three of them.

4822
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:46,660
Doug's got a little different than mine,

4823
02:07:46,661 --> 02:07:47,550
but I told her yes,

4824
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:49,930
I texted Doug right away and was like,

4825
02:07:50,350 --> 02:07:50,801
hey man,

4826
02:07:50,801 --> 02:07:52,330
I think I got that thing you got.

4827
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:53,313
And Doug was like,

4828
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:53,710
ah.

4829
02:07:53,710 --> 02:07:54,640
I hung out with the doctor.

4830
02:07:54,641 --> 02:07:55,474
It's fine.

4831
02:07:55,720 --> 02:07:57,310
I hung out with a doctor.

4832
02:07:57,580 --> 02:07:58,900
It was a gynecologist.

4833
02:07:59,590 --> 02:08:02,230
Doug's crazy last week.

4834
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:03,451
That's right.

4835
02:08:03,451 --> 02:08:04,300
We're talking about that.

4836
02:08:04,330 --> 02:08:04,721
I love,

4837
02:08:04,721 --> 02:08:05,260
I got in here.

4838
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:07,270
I say this and I know there's
a lot of crossover fans.

4839
02:08:07,630 --> 02:08:10,990
If you are a broken fan and you're
not listening to Doug's podcast,

4840
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:14,470
you're missing out a huge portion of,

4841
02:08:14,471 --> 02:08:16,900
of just of what a podcast should be.

4842
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:18,730
His podcast is so fucking good.

4843
02:08:18,770 --> 02:08:20,140
He's great at everything.

4844
02:08:20,170 --> 02:08:21,370
He's great at fucking everything,

4845
02:08:21,371 --> 02:08:21,701
but man,

4846
02:08:21,701 --> 02:08:24,370
his podcast is so bummed out that
he lives in the middle of nowhere.

4847
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:26,880
I'm thinking about taking
a road trip to visit.

4848
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:29,140
Memorable to do a Superbowl party.

4849
02:08:29,170 --> 02:08:29,351
Yeah,

4850
02:08:29,351 --> 02:08:31,270
just to roll it out
because it's not that big.

4851
02:08:31,271 --> 02:08:32,140
It's not that big anymore.

4852
02:08:32,141 --> 02:08:32,801
What are you talking about?

4853
02:08:32,801 --> 02:08:33,221
It's going to be,

4854
02:08:33,221 --> 02:08:36,910
now we're talking about it right now on
a podcast maybe there he released the

4855
02:08:36,911 --> 02:08:38,050
address online.

4856
02:08:38,940 --> 02:08:39,221
What if?

4857
02:08:39,221 --> 02:08:39,761
What if I go,

4858
02:08:39,761 --> 02:08:40,570
I'm going to,

4859
02:08:40,570 --> 02:08:41,650
then it's going to compound.

4860
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:43,300
They're going to get
another hundred people.

4861
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:44,440
It'd be chaos.

4862
02:08:44,570 --> 02:08:46,420
His treats would be overrun with retards.

4863
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:48,303
Ears.

4864
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:49,840
Let me see if I can get as a dress.

4865
02:08:49,841 --> 02:08:50,680
He doesn't give a fuck.

4866
02:08:50,830 --> 02:08:51,700
Here's Stan hopes,

4867
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:52,241
ear stand,

4868
02:08:52,241 --> 02:08:53,290
hopes reply.

4869
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:54,160
Nah.

4870
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:57,880
I've successfully ignored it for
quite a while and it's actually,

4871
02:08:57,881 --> 02:09:01,300
and I actually had a doctor say
that he's ignored his for 30 years.

4872
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:04,260
Then I wrote back to exactly
what I wanted to see.

4873
02:09:05,110 --> 02:09:05,920
It's fine,

4874
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:07,840
unless you plan on lifting anything.

4875
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:09,580
If you want to carry a sand bag up a hill,

4876
02:09:09,581 --> 02:09:12,730
you might have a problem with that thing
cause it'll tear further and is it your

4877
02:09:12,731 --> 02:09:13,541
stomach wall?

4878
02:09:13,541 --> 02:09:13,901
Terrorists.

4879
02:09:13,901 --> 02:09:14,231
Further,

4880
02:09:14,231 --> 02:09:18,880
your intestines will poke out more and
the whole couldn't get bigger depending

4881
02:09:18,881 --> 02:09:20,170
on how much you strained yourself.

4882
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:21,750
Sure.

4883
02:09:21,750 --> 02:09:22,810
You can get just to get it fixed.

4884
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:23,190
Yeah.

4885
02:09:23,190 --> 02:09:23,720
Oh yeah.

4886
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:23,880
I,

4887
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:25,420
I'm going to get to a base level.

4888
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:27,730
Let me give to like two
30 and see where I'm at.

4889
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:29,290
Okay.

4890
02:09:29,290 --> 02:09:30,550
How about just get it checked out?

4891
02:09:30,970 --> 02:09:34,150
I could just get to two 30 just
go get a doctor to look at it.

4892
02:09:34,151 --> 02:09:36,190
They'll probably be able to tell
you right away and then you can go,

4893
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:36,611
oh,

4894
02:09:36,611 --> 02:09:36,851
okay.

4895
02:09:36,851 --> 02:09:39,100
It's nothing when I'm two 30 I'll do that.

4896
02:09:39,250 --> 02:09:40,090
It's got this thing,

4897
02:09:40,091 --> 02:09:40,450
Huh?

4898
02:09:40,450 --> 02:09:43,140
That's the number two 30
I get to two 30 though.

4899
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:47,680
Health checks until two 30 I'm talking
no health techs who rolls into a health

4900
02:09:47,681 --> 02:09:50,530
check fucking like Alan healthy.

4901
02:09:51,070 --> 02:09:53,770
Have you ever been on a horse because
you're not allowed to ride a horse over

4902
02:09:53,771 --> 02:09:55,030
225 pounds.

4903
02:09:55,031 --> 02:09:55,990
So I've been on a lot of horses.

4904
02:09:55,991 --> 02:09:57,190
I've sprinted on horses.

4905
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:57,720
Wow.

4906
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:59,890
That's a red bottle
out to ride on a horse.

4907
02:10:00,250 --> 02:10:03,050
Horses can't go over 225 pounds.

4908
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:04,960
Just like giant horse.

4909
02:10:04,990 --> 02:10:05,770
I didn't know that.

4910
02:10:05,770 --> 02:10:07,210
I ran up through Texas.

4911
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:08,710
What about those Budweiser horses?

4912
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:09,573
Their biggest fuck.

4913
02:10:10,150 --> 02:10:12,790
You can totally ride that
bitch like Conan the barbarian,

4914
02:10:12,791 --> 02:10:14,210
the new game of Thrones horses.

4915
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:15,073
That's cool course.

4916
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:18,280
I would seem to me that
that horse kid like take me,

4917
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:18,820
well,

4918
02:10:18,820 --> 02:10:22,870
I'm only 200 but if I was to 20 I
would think a horse could take me.

4919
02:10:22,871 --> 02:10:23,704
No problem.

4920
02:10:23,770 --> 02:10:25,120
Those big giant horses,

4921
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:26,650
they can take like three or four.

4922
02:10:26,651 --> 02:10:29,320
I bet those giant
clydesdale looking things.

4923
02:10:29,790 --> 02:10:30,760
She'll tear Burt's.

4924
02:10:31,510 --> 02:10:34,040
You're been in front of one
of those things in real life.

4925
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:34,910
Oh yeah.

4926
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:35,900
Oh my God.

4927
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:40,310
There's so big like their muscles and
like you think about the fact that this

4928
02:10:40,311 --> 02:10:42,830
thing just lets you climb
on its back and it runs.

4929
02:10:43,480 --> 02:10:44,650
Don't get me started.

4930
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:46,270
Horses are incredible,

4931
02:10:46,271 --> 02:10:46,720
man.

4932
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:49,210
I laid in bed with my dogs
last night and I thought,

4933
02:10:49,270 --> 02:10:49,620
oh,

4934
02:10:49,620 --> 02:10:51,100
I thought how fucking cool.

4935
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:52,390
I think that's in the Bible.

4936
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:53,590
Oh nevermind.

4937
02:10:53,730 --> 02:10:54,563
I go with the story.

4938
02:10:55,220 --> 02:10:56,053
I call her.

4939
02:10:56,950 --> 02:10:57,783
How cool,

4940
02:10:57,850 --> 02:11:02,200
how cool is it to like like get in bed
with two warriors who are ready to go to

4941
02:11:02,201 --> 02:11:04,750
fucking battle for you if
someone rolls in the bedroom.

4942
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:05,470
I was like,

4943
02:11:05,470 --> 02:11:06,850
I really felt like Jon snow.

4944
02:11:06,851 --> 02:11:08,040
Like it was like,

4945
02:11:08,050 --> 02:11:08,590
it's fine.

4946
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:08,981
I was like,

4947
02:11:08,981 --> 02:11:09,191
man,

4948
02:11:09,191 --> 02:11:10,330
I'm sitting here with Priscilla.

4949
02:11:10,350 --> 02:11:11,620
Mona is a little shit dog,

4950
02:11:11,621 --> 02:11:15,760
but Priscilla who's like 130 pounds
just sitting there just at my leg,

4951
02:11:15,761 --> 02:11:16,900
just staring at the door,

4952
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:18,130
sleeping face to the door.

4953
02:11:18,310 --> 02:11:19,240
Any noise made.

4954
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:21,640
She's up and willing to die for me.

4955
02:11:21,641 --> 02:11:22,240
I thought,

4956
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:23,073
how cool is it?

4957
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:24,370
Like my wife would never do that.

4958
02:11:26,020 --> 02:11:27,850
Female dogs are super protective.

4959
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:29,350
They're really good at that.

4960
02:11:29,351 --> 02:11:29,621
How many,

4961
02:11:29,621 --> 02:11:31,630
how many pimples did you
lay in bed with at one time?

4962
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:33,370
I had three in bed at one time.

4963
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:35,073
Who fucks?

4964
02:11:35,170 --> 02:11:35,531
Okay.

4965
02:11:35,531 --> 02:11:36,400
Think about how,

4966
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:37,870
how defensible that is.

4967
02:11:40,650 --> 02:11:41,160
No,

4968
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:43,270
but the three ones,

4969
02:11:43,730 --> 02:11:45,250
what's your favorite to come on?

4970
02:11:48,670 --> 02:11:49,503
Who,

4971
02:11:49,930 --> 02:11:52,120
which ones got balls and out here know

4972
02:11:55,030 --> 02:11:56,560
who could fuck with that bedroom?

4973
02:11:56,710 --> 02:11:58,510
You got three pimples and you and a bed.

4974
02:11:58,540 --> 02:12:00,130
Like with guns,

4975
02:12:00,950 --> 02:12:01,990
I might say great

4976
02:12:02,120 --> 02:12:03,010
equalizers,

4977
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:03,853
guns,

4978
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:05,750
the great equalizer.

4979
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:06,890
I need to get a gun.

4980
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:07,880
And it's about time.

4981
02:12:07,910 --> 02:12:09,200
It's a good goal for everybody.

4982
02:12:09,201 --> 02:12:11,030
Is scared of people thinking.

4983
02:12:11,031 --> 02:12:14,600
Now when you have like the San Bernardino
thing that happened is that people are

4984
02:12:14,601 --> 02:12:16,920
just going to be ready and armed and,

4985
02:12:17,030 --> 02:12:18,770
and we're going to turn
into some sort of a,

4986
02:12:18,771 --> 02:12:20,060
a military state.

4987
02:12:20,570 --> 02:12:20,781
I mean,

4988
02:12:20,781 --> 02:12:21,680
how many of these things can that,

4989
02:12:21,681 --> 02:12:21,940
you know,

4990
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:23,180
two of them happen yesterday.

4991
02:12:23,181 --> 02:12:24,260
Here's another weird thing.

4992
02:12:24,680 --> 02:12:29,510
Most people don't know that there was a
second arm mass shooting and killing and

4993
02:12:29,511 --> 02:12:30,344
Georgia.

4994
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:30,950
What?

4995
02:12:30,950 --> 02:12:31,130
Uh,

4996
02:12:31,130 --> 02:12:31,371
yeah,

4997
02:12:31,371 --> 02:12:33,920
it was near Atlanta on the same day,

4998
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:35,383
same day.

4999
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:38,450
There was a four people
were killed in Georgia,

5000
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:38,800
I think.

5001
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:39,770
Was it in Atlanta?

5002
02:12:39,970 --> 02:12:40,350
Yeah,

5003
02:12:40,350 --> 02:12:40,750
right.

5004
02:12:40,750 --> 02:12:41,583
It was in Atlanta.

5005
02:12:44,710 --> 02:12:45,240
You know,

5006
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:45,360
I,

5007
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:50,260
it's one of those things that I do not
know if there was a fucking solution for.

5008
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:50,930
It's,

5009
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:55,660
it's one of those weird things where you
look at the amount of guns that exist.

5010
02:12:55,930 --> 02:13:00,850
You look at the amount of people that
there are e mount of disenfranchised

5011
02:13:00,851 --> 02:13:02,650
people with mental illnesses.

5012
02:13:02,651 --> 02:13:04,750
The amount of people that
are religious fanatics,

5013
02:13:04,751 --> 02:13:09,700
the amount of people that are
just fucking bat shit crazy.

5014
02:13:10,210 --> 02:13:14,620
And when you deal with 350 million people,

5015
02:13:14,650 --> 02:13:16,630
which is I think what
the United States is now,

5016
02:13:16,631 --> 02:13:21,100
somewhere between 300
and 350 you're going to,

5017
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:24,070
you're going to have a certain
amount of nutty fucking people.

5018
02:13:24,071 --> 02:13:24,760
Man.

5019
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:27,160
It's this almost no avoiding it.

5020
02:13:27,550 --> 02:13:32,160
There's so much pressure and stress
and life is difficult for you're,

5021
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:35,580
you're a successful guy with three TV
shows and you're talking about how much

5022
02:13:35,581 --> 02:13:36,990
you have to drink to be on a plane.

5023
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:40,800
It talking about anxiety that you getting
a hotel room and you're a successful

5024
02:13:40,801 --> 02:13:45,540
standup comedian and a television
host of three fucking shows you,

5025
02:13:45,541 --> 02:13:47,100
your life has balling.

5026
02:13:47,370 --> 02:13:48,720
You've got a beautiful wife,

5027
02:13:48,721 --> 02:13:50,040
you have a great family,

5028
02:13:50,041 --> 02:13:51,150
you're hilarious.

5029
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:52,650
You're a good guy.

5030
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:56,130
It's like everything is in
place and you still freak out.

5031
02:13:56,370 --> 02:14:00,750
Imagine some guy who's married to
some monster who works for a tyrant,

5032
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:02,520
who lives in a Shithole,

5033
02:14:02,610 --> 02:14:07,610
whose every day just look at this crime
and flat tires and stealing and breaking

5034
02:14:08,431 --> 02:14:09,330
and entering,

5035
02:14:09,331 --> 02:14:10,950
and that's his life every day,

5036
02:14:10,951 --> 02:14:12,690
all day constantly.

5037
02:14:13,890 --> 02:14:15,510
And there's a lot of
people like that out there,

5038
02:14:15,511 --> 02:14:15,791
man.

5039
02:14:15,791 --> 02:14:17,490
There's a lot of people
that don't get any love.

5040
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:18,181
There's,

5041
02:14:18,181 --> 02:14:21,090
they have no place in their life
where it feels like they're making a

5042
02:14:21,091 --> 02:14:21,924
connection.

5043
02:14:21,990 --> 02:14:22,860
They've missed,

5044
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:25,260
they've been slammed in
the walls at every term.

5045
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:27,000
They have a dumb job.

5046
02:14:27,090 --> 02:14:29,370
They don't give a fuck
about that a robot can do.

5047
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:34,680
They're idiots and they just realize
it and they're fucking horrified and

5048
02:14:34,681 --> 02:14:36,000
they're angry and they're,

5049
02:14:36,030 --> 02:14:41,030
they're programming from birth to today
has been nothing but dog shit by Shitty

5050
02:14:41,461 --> 02:14:44,790
parents and shitty circumstances
and shitty genetics,

5051
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:46,230
shitty neighborhood,

5052
02:14:46,231 --> 02:14:47,790
shitty life experiences,

5053
02:14:47,791 --> 02:14:48,750
bullying,

5054
02:14:48,751 --> 02:14:49,351
rape,

5055
02:14:49,351 --> 02:14:50,580
molestation,

5056
02:14:50,581 --> 02:14:51,630
alcoholism,

5057
02:14:51,631 --> 02:14:52,464
racism,

5058
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:56,160
constantly over and over and
over and over and over and over.

5059
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:57,660
And they somehow survive.

5060
02:14:57,661 --> 02:14:59,280
To get to the point where
they get their hands on a gun.

5061
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:01,560
That's what we're dealing with.

5062
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:02,670
That's what we're dealing with.

5063
02:15:02,671 --> 02:15:07,671
We're dealing with is humans freaking
out and finding a way to kill the humans

5064
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:11,250
to focus on the mechanism in
which they're doing that with.

5065
02:15:11,970 --> 02:15:14,160
We're missing a giant piece of the puzzle.

5066
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:17,940
There's too many fucking guns for sure.

5067
02:15:18,030 --> 02:15:20,490
It's too easy to get a gun for sure.

5068
02:15:20,700 --> 02:15:21,331
You should have,

5069
02:15:21,331 --> 02:15:21,511
look,

5070
02:15:21,511 --> 02:15:22,344
I have guns.

5071
02:15:22,350 --> 02:15:23,940
You should have to take tests.

5072
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:25,050
Okay?

5073
02:15:25,050 --> 02:15:29,520
You should have to be some very stringent
requirements on your capabilities.

5074
02:15:29,521 --> 02:15:29,661
We,

5075
02:15:29,661 --> 02:15:29,841
we,

5076
02:15:29,841 --> 02:15:33,360
we should know exactly how you
do know what the safety is.

5077
02:15:33,530 --> 02:15:35,760
Do you know what's a safe
way to point the gun?

5078
02:15:35,910 --> 02:15:37,590
Do you know how to load it correctly?

5079
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:38,580
Do you know how to clean it?

5080
02:15:38,581 --> 02:15:39,414
You clean it,

5081
02:15:39,440 --> 02:15:43,800
but you just have this ultimate weapon
of destruction and you don't have to have

5082
02:15:43,830 --> 02:15:45,450
any knowledge of how to use it at all.

5083
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:46,590
But to have a car,

5084
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:48,360
you have to show that you could turn,

5085
02:15:48,450 --> 02:15:50,160
you could hit the brakes,

5086
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:51,720
you can hit the blinkers.

5087
02:15:51,721 --> 02:15:53,250
You have to show all of this competency.

5088
02:15:53,251 --> 02:15:53,661
You have to host,

5089
02:15:53,661 --> 02:15:56,700
show all this knowledge of all
the laws and all the rules.

5090
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:59,160
You don't need to show none
of that thing to get a gun.

5091
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:01,110
All you have to do is
just not be a criminal.

5092
02:16:02,730 --> 02:16:03,563
That's all I have to do.

5093
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:04,370
Don't be a criminal.

5094
02:16:04,370 --> 02:16:04,921
Are you a criminal?

5095
02:16:04,921 --> 02:16:05,880
We're going to do a little check on you,

5096
02:16:05,881 --> 02:16:06,714
Mr. Crusher.

5097
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:06,901
Oh,

5098
02:16:06,901 --> 02:16:07,680
you're not a criminal,

5099
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,513
but here's your gun.

5100
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:09,210
Okay,

5101
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:10,021
question number two.

5102
02:16:10,021 --> 02:16:10,854
Are you an idiot?

5103
02:16:11,660 --> 02:16:12,140
Are you,

5104
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:14,400
and who's to decide who's to decide?

5105
02:16:14,490 --> 02:16:15,323
Who the fuck are you?

5106
02:16:15,390 --> 02:16:16,201
Cause I'm an idiot too.

5107
02:16:16,201 --> 02:16:17,034
A lot of people,

5108
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:19,800
I would say a lot of people are
idiots and they would be it.

5109
02:16:19,810 --> 02:16:21,300
It's to me and to them,

5110
02:16:21,301 --> 02:16:24,330
there'd be some people that they know
that would be stupid as fuck with his

5111
02:16:24,331 --> 02:16:25,410
levels of people.

5112
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:25,981
You know?

5113
02:16:25,981 --> 02:16:27,330
And you and I are not at the top.

5114
02:16:27,660 --> 02:16:28,493
We're just not.

5115
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:30,310
There's people out
there that invented Wifi

5116
02:16:30,850 --> 02:16:35,590
and they're using lasers to
give us fucking satellite
communication and all the

5117
02:16:35,591 --> 02:16:38,770
crazy shit that you and I know of
that we could never invent on our own.

5118
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:41,260
There's some people out of their
way fucking smarter than us,

5119
02:16:41,261 --> 02:16:41,740
dude,

5120
02:16:41,740 --> 02:16:42,700
and they're making that shit.

5121
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:44,950
That's the reality of life.

5122
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:50,540
Oh yeah.

5123
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:53,420
They're a little too high
for this conversation.

5124
02:16:54,380 --> 02:16:55,213
Too High,

5125
02:16:55,820 --> 02:16:56,451
too high,

5126
02:16:56,451 --> 02:16:57,830
too high to break it down.

5127
02:16:57,860 --> 02:16:58,430
I was like,

5128
02:16:58,430 --> 02:16:59,263
I was like,

5129
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:02,440
you know what scares me the most
about the San Bernardino killing?

5130
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:05,800
Why is it didn't surprise me that
that's what scares me the most.

5131
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:06,970
What scares me the most is like,

5132
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:07,300
oh,

5133
02:17:07,300 --> 02:17:08,133
another one.

5134
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:09,460
It seems like almost every day now.

5135
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:12,190
Like I like every day it's
been something almost,

5136
02:17:12,470 --> 02:17:12,651
well,

5137
02:17:12,651 --> 02:17:16,820
they have that calendar out that the
calendar shows that it's like literally 13

5138
02:17:16,821 --> 02:17:18,710
days a month that there's mass shootings,

5139
02:17:19,150 --> 02:17:20,540
isis advent calendar.

5140
02:17:20,870 --> 02:17:21,890
Is that what it is for real?

5141
02:17:21,980 --> 02:17:22,371
Oh,

5142
02:17:22,371 --> 02:17:23,870
I maybe I don't do enough research,

5143
02:17:24,470 --> 02:17:26,630
but like it just seems so crazy.

5144
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:27,470
Well,

5145
02:17:27,470 --> 02:17:30,050
here's the problem is exactly
what you've said is I love,

5146
02:17:30,890 --> 02:17:31,723
I agree.

5147
02:17:32,270 --> 02:17:33,560
Something's wrong with our system,

5148
02:17:33,561 --> 02:17:34,390
with the guns there,

5149
02:17:34,390 --> 02:17:35,330
that something needs to be done.

5150
02:17:35,331 --> 02:17:39,200
Something needs to be changed because
we have a lot of fucking mass killings.

5151
02:17:39,230 --> 02:17:39,521
And,

5152
02:17:39,521 --> 02:17:42,080
and from what I hear
from Jim Jefferies Act,

5153
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:43,100
there's done in Australia,

5154
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:45,710
well they took the guns away.

5155
02:17:45,711 --> 02:17:46,760
They had a mass killing,

5156
02:17:46,761 --> 02:17:48,620
I think quite a while.

5157
02:17:48,750 --> 02:17:51,800
Jim Jefferies want to say was in the
eighties Jim Jefferies has a very,

5158
02:17:51,810 --> 02:17:51,920
uh,

5159
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:54,540
viral bit that every time
there's a mass shooting,

5160
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:56,520
he gets another 12 million views.

5161
02:17:56,540 --> 02:17:56,741
And I,

5162
02:17:56,741 --> 02:17:56,961
and I,

5163
02:17:56,961 --> 02:17:57,751
and I love Jim,

5164
02:17:57,751 --> 02:17:58,321
I'm not shitting on it,

5165
02:17:58,321 --> 02:17:59,100
but like,

5166
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:01,170
but like it is about that fact.

5167
02:18:01,171 --> 02:18:03,810
There was one mass shooting and they all
took their guns back and they've never

5168
02:18:03,811 --> 02:18:05,910
had another killing
mass shooting Australia.

5169
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:07,150
Well,

5170
02:18:07,150 --> 02:18:12,150
you're dealing with a place
that has way less people.

5171
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:13,720
Here's Australia,

5172
02:18:14,050 --> 02:18:17,230
20 million people and
mostly in two cities.

5173
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:19,090
There's very few people.

5174
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:21,080
So was that his leg,

5175
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:23,350
country of Australia is
pretty massive as well.

5176
02:18:23,351 --> 02:18:23,531
Right?

5177
02:18:23,531 --> 02:18:24,220
It's gigantic.

5178
02:18:24,220 --> 02:18:27,340
It's the same size as the contiguous.

5179
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:28,233
That's how they say it.

5180
02:18:28,470 --> 02:18:32,650
Continuous or continuous thought the
entirety of the United States of America.

5181
02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:34,120
Same size,

5182
02:18:35,980 --> 02:18:37,840
same size essentially.

5183
02:18:37,930 --> 02:18:39,720
And they've got the
politicians about laying there.

5184
02:18:40,150 --> 02:18:40,480
Yeah.

5185
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:41,313
Less.

5186
02:18:41,770 --> 02:18:44,350
Less than La.

5187
02:18:44,350 --> 02:18:44,470
Holy Shit.

5188
02:18:44,470 --> 02:18:46,480
He's got 20 million people plus Mexicans.

5189
02:18:46,510 --> 02:18:46,751
Okay.

5190
02:18:46,751 --> 02:18:47,584
Let's be honest.

5191
02:18:47,950 --> 02:18:48,940
What are the real numbers?

5192
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:49,221
Oh,

5193
02:18:49,221 --> 02:18:50,051
I was going to be through the phone.

5194
02:18:50,051 --> 02:18:51,040
I love Mexicans.

5195
02:18:51,070 --> 02:18:53,320
I'm not hating on illegal immigrants.

5196
02:18:53,321 --> 02:18:54,940
I love people that are willing,

5197
02:18:54,941 --> 02:18:55,990
documented workers,

5198
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:56,920
whatever you want to call them.

5199
02:18:57,280 --> 02:18:58,360
I call them Mexicans.

5200
02:18:58,540 --> 02:19:03,540
I love people that have the courage to
do something illegal to better their

5201
02:19:03,761 --> 02:19:04,260
life.

5202
02:19:04,260 --> 02:19:04,500
Yeah.

5203
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:05,800
And I think a lot of them are great.

5204
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:07,050
I think a lot of them aren't.

5205
02:19:07,060 --> 02:19:09,370
They embody what America's supposed to be.

5206
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:12,250
American is supposed to be this place
where you can go and you could make it,

5207
02:19:12,670 --> 02:19:13,220
you know this,

5208
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:14,800
this spot where it's freedom.

5209
02:19:14,801 --> 02:19:15,070
You don't,

5210
02:19:15,070 --> 02:19:20,070
you don't get suppressed by just fucking
generation after generation of people

5211
02:19:20,381 --> 02:19:21,101
doing it wrong.

5212
02:19:21,101 --> 02:19:22,900
You can get the fuck
out of Mexico and Woo.

5213
02:19:23,230 --> 02:19:24,063
Ah,

5214
02:19:24,070 --> 02:19:25,720
and you get to America and just hustle.

5215
02:19:25,780 --> 02:19:26,650
Just go to work.

5216
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:27,410
Just,

5217
02:19:27,410 --> 02:19:28,850
just go after it.

5218
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:30,170
It's jobs out there.

5219
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:30,840
Get them.

5220
02:19:30,840 --> 02:19:32,420
But then what about the Syrian refugees?

5221
02:19:32,870 --> 02:19:33,141
Yeah,

5222
02:19:33,141 --> 02:19:33,401
man,

5223
02:19:33,401 --> 02:19:34,030
it's good to bullshit.

5224
02:19:34,030 --> 02:19:34,761
Fucking doesn't want them.

5225
02:19:34,761 --> 02:19:35,121
Well listen,

5226
02:19:35,121 --> 02:19:36,410
it's against our question.

5227
02:19:36,450 --> 02:19:37,161
That's against what,

5228
02:19:37,161 --> 02:19:38,900
what makes us up could not welcome.

5229
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:39,350
Exactly.

5230
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:40,183
First of all,

5231
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,730
those are the people that
are leaving the bad people.

5232
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:44,781
Like where are we?

5233
02:19:44,781 --> 02:19:46,460
Assuming that everybody over there is bad.

5234
02:19:46,490 --> 02:19:49,760
You can't do that because then
that's a self fulfilling prophecy.

5235
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:51,920
If you won't let them in
and you don't treat that,

5236
02:19:51,950 --> 02:19:54,620
I give them open arms like
just because they're Muslims.

5237
02:19:54,621 --> 02:19:55,670
That's ridiculous.

5238
02:19:55,690 --> 02:19:55,851
Oh,

5239
02:19:55,851 --> 02:19:56,590
hold on.

5240
02:19:56,590 --> 02:19:57,200
Some of this,

5241
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:59,810
how the attackers in Paris
were Syrian refugees,

5242
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:02,620
so I'm not upset.

5243
02:20:02,770 --> 02:20:03,230
Yeah,

5244
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:04,830
well a hundred percent
for whatever I fucking,

5245
02:20:04,831 --> 02:20:04,990
yeah,

5246
02:20:04,990 --> 02:20:05,570
I mean I don't,

5247
02:20:05,570 --> 02:20:06,111
I don't know.

5248
02:20:06,111 --> 02:20:10,310
I think what they got to look out
for his young radicalized single men,

5249
02:20:12,420 --> 02:20:17,420
that's what the entirety of this movement
seems to be as he's radicalized young,

5250
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:18,561
younger men.

5251
02:20:18,561 --> 02:20:23,561
Like that Jihadi John Guy was like a
former rapper from England and he joined

5252
02:20:23,901 --> 02:20:24,441
Isis.

5253
02:20:24,441 --> 02:20:26,930
Like there's a lot of people
that are joining this.

5254
02:20:27,710 --> 02:20:28,940
It's very strange,

5255
02:20:28,941 --> 02:20:29,750
dude.

5256
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:30,770
It's very strange.

5257
02:20:30,771 --> 02:20:33,470
Like girls are joining and
they're getting killed.

5258
02:20:33,890 --> 02:20:34,370
You know,

5259
02:20:34,370 --> 02:20:34,670
one,

5260
02:20:34,670 --> 02:20:38,480
one of the girls recently got beaten
to death and another one got murdered.

5261
02:20:38,481 --> 02:20:39,314
It's like,

5262
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:41,090
what is going on?

5263
02:20:41,720 --> 02:20:43,790
I thought it was closeted homosexuals.

5264
02:20:43,791 --> 02:20:46,680
At first I thought tariffs were,

5265
02:20:47,400 --> 02:20:50,160
I thought they were all just
closeted homosexual come after him.

5266
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:53,390
Kreischer don't say my worried about comp.

5267
02:20:53,420 --> 02:20:54,680
You've worried about comedy central,

5268
02:20:54,681 --> 02:20:56,000
but you know worried about saying that.

5269
02:20:58,100 --> 02:20:58,940
That's hilarious.

5270
02:20:59,010 --> 02:21:00,140
You've been drawing Muhammad.

5271
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:01,413
Okay.

5272
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:07,240
That's hilarious.

5273
02:21:07,650 --> 02:21:08,483
A lot of like,

5274
02:21:08,530 --> 02:21:12,790
like like homosexuality so kept down there
like maybe they're just guys that are

5275
02:21:12,791 --> 02:21:13,624
fucking,

5276
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:14,201
no,

5277
02:21:14,201 --> 02:21:15,190
I don't think that's what it is.

5278
02:21:15,191 --> 02:21:16,090
Sitting in a cave like,

5279
02:21:16,091 --> 02:21:16,461
hey man,

5280
02:21:16,461 --> 02:21:17,740
I call blow you and the guys are like,

5281
02:21:17,741 --> 02:21:18,041
what?

5282
02:21:18,041 --> 02:21:18,311
And he's like,

5283
02:21:18,311 --> 02:21:18,941
I saw it blow up.

5284
02:21:18,941 --> 02:21:19,810
Let's go blow each other up.

5285
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:22,590
Oh no dairy you.

5286
02:21:22,810 --> 02:21:24,280
It's just radical ideologies,

5287
02:21:24,281 --> 02:21:24,790
man.

5288
02:21:24,790 --> 02:21:25,623
That's all it is.

5289
02:21:26,020 --> 02:21:26,570
The idea,

5290
02:21:26,570 --> 02:21:28,630
this is the fact that there
could be anything out there,

5291
02:21:28,690 --> 02:21:29,380
anything,

5292
02:21:29,380 --> 02:21:30,130
anything,

5293
02:21:30,130 --> 02:21:31,360
call it whatever you want.

5294
02:21:31,390 --> 02:21:32,051
Don't call it,

5295
02:21:32,051 --> 02:21:33,400
don't even call it a name.

5296
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:35,290
Just think about whatever it is,

5297
02:21:35,291 --> 02:21:39,940
the energy and the influence that leads
someone to go shooting a bunch of random

5298
02:21:39,941 --> 02:21:40,774
people.

5299
02:21:40,780 --> 02:21:44,290
I think one of the problems with
labeling things when we start saying,

5300
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:44,621
oh,

5301
02:21:44,621 --> 02:21:46,270
this was a mass shooting,

5302
02:21:46,271 --> 02:21:48,340
this was a religious killing.

5303
02:21:48,341 --> 02:21:50,470
This was a jihadi cell.

5304
02:21:50,470 --> 02:21:51,080
This was,

5305
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:53,320
we'd give it all these titles and names,

5306
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:56,650
but just separate yourself from culture,

5307
02:21:56,651 --> 02:22:00,520
like pretend you're an alien or
something and you're looking at this,

5308
02:22:00,580 --> 02:22:03,640
you're looking at this from
afar and you're just looking
at this as some sort of

5309
02:22:03,641 --> 02:22:04,960
an equation or something like that.

5310
02:22:04,961 --> 02:22:06,280
You're watching what's going down,

5311
02:22:06,670 --> 02:22:07,390
like what is it,

5312
02:22:07,390 --> 02:22:07,961
what's going down?

5313
02:22:07,961 --> 02:22:10,180
Like what is it that can,

5314
02:22:10,330 --> 02:22:15,330
these things down here
can convince themselves by
manipulation of communication.

5315
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:18,220
So they've got a way
to talk to each other.

5316
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:22,660
They've got a way to relay
ideas and they've got a way
to reinforce opinions and

5317
02:22:22,661 --> 02:22:23,494
ideas later,

5318
02:22:23,740 --> 02:22:25,000
thousands of years old,

5319
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:26,190
and they got a way that

5320
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:31,490
it's so strong that it can make some
of them explode and just go around,

5321
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:36,360
kill random people and think somehow or
another they're doing it for the greater

5322
02:22:36,361 --> 02:22:37,140
good.

5323
02:22:37,140 --> 02:22:37,973
So they'll,

5324
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:41,160
through this I this ancient ideology,

5325
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:42,720
this is whatever it is,

5326
02:22:42,721 --> 02:22:43,590
call it whatever you want,

5327
02:22:43,591 --> 02:22:48,180
but through through this influenced by
some people's minds that's projected

5328
02:22:48,181 --> 02:22:50,190
somehow or another into
another person's mind.

5329
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:52,770
And it convinces that person
to kill random people.

5330
02:22:52,771 --> 02:22:54,090
Forget about what you call it.

5331
02:22:54,360 --> 02:22:59,360
Forget about whether it's Islam or
Christianity or Mormon is or Scientology.

5332
02:23:01,051 --> 02:23:02,280
Forget the names,

5333
02:23:02,281 --> 02:23:03,114
forget it.

5334
02:23:03,330 --> 02:23:06,660
Just forget even the language
that has been spoken in,

5335
02:23:06,900 --> 02:23:10,830
look at it in terms of what are the
noises that are made by the humans that

5336
02:23:10,831 --> 02:23:14,320
create the reaction and one of
those norms is with those noise.

5337
02:23:14,321 --> 02:23:15,121
What are those words?

5338
02:23:15,121 --> 02:23:16,710
One of those written things represent,

5339
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:18,260
they represent like,

5340
02:23:18,700 --> 02:23:18,910
oh,

5341
02:23:18,910 --> 02:23:20,970
like almost like a living idea,

5342
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:26,400
a living idea that wants to express
itself like through the filter of the

5343
02:23:26,401 --> 02:23:27,720
language and the culture.

5344
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:28,770
Like what is it?

5345
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:33,800
What is it that causes something
to want to get people to go after?

5346
02:23:35,701 --> 02:23:40,020
People that are opposed to this idea
or that have differing ideas and killed

5347
02:23:40,021 --> 02:23:40,320
them.

5348
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,510
Just killed them by parenting.

5349
02:23:42,540 --> 02:23:43,710
It's all bad parenting.

5350
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:45,900
Isis is the worst parenting in the road.

5351
02:23:46,410 --> 02:23:47,250
If you think about it,

5352
02:23:47,251 --> 02:23:48,084
that's what it is.

5353
02:23:48,530 --> 02:23:50,580
The right and we might,

5354
02:23:50,630 --> 02:23:52,560
it just might be a point to that.

5355
02:23:52,880 --> 02:23:53,520
Yeah,

5356
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:54,480
there might be a point to it.

5357
02:23:54,481 --> 02:23:57,360
It will to all the ancient cultures,

5358
02:23:57,361 --> 02:23:58,194
right?

5359
02:23:58,200 --> 02:24:01,230
Like if you think about
people that made a break,

5360
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:03,540
like those are the ones that
seem to be the healthiest.

5361
02:24:03,541 --> 02:24:04,980
Like the Australians.

5362
02:24:05,220 --> 02:24:06,330
They made a break from England.

5363
02:24:06,660 --> 02:24:07,530
They got in a boat,

5364
02:24:07,710 --> 02:24:08,660
they got kicked out there,

5365
02:24:08,661 --> 02:24:09,494
a prison colony.

5366
02:24:09,510 --> 02:24:09,811
Right.

5367
02:24:09,811 --> 02:24:11,010
So they made him get in a boat,

5368
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:13,650
go over to Australia and live there.

5369
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:14,220
Right.

5370
02:24:14,220 --> 02:24:15,810
That's essentially how Australia started.

5371
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:16,650
Yeah,

5372
02:24:16,650 --> 02:24:17,610
but look at them.

5373
02:24:17,910 --> 02:24:19,230
The fucking amazing.

5374
02:24:19,380 --> 02:24:20,850
Their cities are incredible.

5375
02:24:20,940 --> 02:24:22,740
The people are cool as fuck.

5376
02:24:22,890 --> 02:24:26,130
They're generally like really
easy to talk to and friendly.

5377
02:24:26,310 --> 02:24:27,270
They're smart.

5378
02:24:27,380 --> 02:24:27,660
Like,

5379
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:27,931
dude,

5380
02:24:27,931 --> 02:24:29,580
Melbourne was amazing.

5381
02:24:29,790 --> 02:24:32,610
It's like a like almost didn't
want to tell people about it.

5382
02:24:33,030 --> 02:24:33,811
I'm almost over here.

5383
02:24:33,811 --> 02:24:34,111
I'm like,

5384
02:24:34,111 --> 02:24:34,890
Whoa,

5385
02:24:34,890 --> 02:24:35,610
this is,

5386
02:24:35,610 --> 02:24:37,560
where else is there
like this in the world?

5387
02:24:37,650 --> 02:24:38,300
Oh Dude.

5388
02:24:38,300 --> 02:24:40,340
Astra Australia is like your growth,

5389
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:41,370
your girlfriends,

5390
02:24:41,610 --> 02:24:42,061
younger,

5391
02:24:42,061 --> 02:24:42,900
hotter sister.

5392
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:45,300
You sit down at Thanksgiving
and you're like,

5393
02:24:45,301 --> 02:24:46,350
mother Fucker,

5394
02:24:46,351 --> 02:24:47,430
I didn't know she was coming,

5395
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:48,730
but look what it is.

5396
02:24:48,731 --> 02:24:48,971
It's a,

5397
02:24:48,971 --> 02:24:49,301
it's a,

5398
02:24:49,301 --> 02:24:53,860
it's a civilization that
emerged or culture that
emerged out of a break from an

5399
02:24:53,861 --> 02:24:54,491
old culture.

5400
02:24:54,491 --> 02:24:54,901
They started,

5401
02:24:54,901 --> 02:24:57,070
they kind of had a reset
and they started fresh.

5402
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:00,250
The people that are stuck in the
spots that are super ancient.

5403
02:25:00,670 --> 02:25:04,150
You're dealing with this pattern
repeating itself over and over again.

5404
02:25:04,320 --> 02:25:05,260
It's hard to break.

5405
02:25:05,550 --> 02:25:09,090
So what you're saying is like all my
friends that when I go down to Tampa,

5406
02:25:09,270 --> 02:25:13,140
then they're left Tampa and they're
kind of still using racial slurs.

5407
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:16,110
What that is is on a global scale,

5408
02:25:16,111 --> 02:25:20,280
people that have never left that area for
thousands of years exactly is he just,

5409
02:25:20,281 --> 02:25:21,570
it's just ignorance.

5410
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:24,310
So your experience begets

5411
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:27,370
a kind of openmindedness.

5412
02:25:27,550 --> 02:25:27,761
Well,

5413
02:25:27,761 --> 02:25:28,900
I think that it's just,

5414
02:25:28,990 --> 02:25:33,990
it's very difficult to break out of the
hive if you're in a hive mind of people

5415
02:25:34,841 --> 02:25:37,930
that are essentially thinking the same
way they did when Alexander the Great was

5416
02:25:37,931 --> 02:25:38,764
around.

5417
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:39,910
It's very,

5418
02:25:39,910 --> 02:25:40,743
it's hard.

5419
02:25:40,810 --> 02:25:43,120
Like Afghanistan is a perfect example.

5420
02:25:43,240 --> 02:25:44,710
There's really only one city.

5421
02:25:45,070 --> 02:25:45,251
I mean,

5422
02:25:45,251 --> 02:25:48,400
I don't know much about Afghanistan
honestly because I really haven't been

5423
02:25:48,401 --> 02:25:48,970
there,

5424
02:25:48,970 --> 02:25:51,430
but I've talked to many
people that have been there,

5425
02:25:51,670 --> 02:25:53,020
soldiers that have fought there,

5426
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:58,210
and I've absorbed as much as I could
what they were trying to say and tried to

5427
02:25:58,211 --> 02:25:58,991
figure it out.

5428
02:25:58,991 --> 02:26:03,991
But essentially what it seems like is
you have one city and then you have these

5429
02:26:04,810 --> 02:26:07,930
strange areas that are
controlled by warlords.

5430
02:26:08,260 --> 02:26:09,310
Like a lot of them,

5431
02:26:10,090 --> 02:26:13,300
they have like these areas
where it's not just like,

5432
02:26:13,301 --> 02:26:13,590
uh,

5433
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:13,880
like,

5434
02:26:13,880 --> 02:26:15,550
like what I'd imagine Iraq to be.

5435
02:26:15,610 --> 02:26:17,260
It's insanely mountainous,

5436
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:18,160
insane.

5437
02:26:18,410 --> 02:26:20,140
Like just like a small town in,

5438
02:26:20,210 --> 02:26:21,043
in,

5439
02:26:21,140 --> 02:26:21,520
uh,

5440
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:22,151
say Butler,

5441
02:26:22,151 --> 02:26:24,520
Ohio would be a control by a warlord.

5442
02:26:25,150 --> 02:26:25,830
Yeah,

5443
02:26:25,830 --> 02:26:26,590
yeah,

5444
02:26:26,590 --> 02:26:27,160
yeah,

5445
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:27,970
yeah.

5446
02:26:27,970 --> 02:26:29,060
No targets do.

5447
02:26:29,070 --> 02:26:29,201
Well,

5448
02:26:29,201 --> 02:26:29,740
you know,

5449
02:26:29,740 --> 02:26:30,790
John Mccain,

5450
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:33,280
I remember this was
trying to impart that on,

5451
02:26:33,850 --> 02:26:34,330
on uh,

5452
02:26:34,330 --> 02:26:38,120
Barack Obama when they were debating when
they were running for President Mccain

5453
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:43,160
and Sarah Palin and he said the exact
same words that I would just said.

5454
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:47,260
Like that's where I got it from him
and initially installed until I started

5455
02:26:47,261 --> 02:26:49,420
looking into it and talking to
these guys that went over there.

5456
02:26:49,900 --> 02:26:52,840
They said it's like the same as
when Alexander the Great was around.

5457
02:26:53,130 --> 02:26:54,220
And that's what Mccain said.

5458
02:26:54,221 --> 02:26:55,330
He said to Obama like,

5459
02:26:55,540 --> 02:26:56,380
this is your,

5460
02:26:56,381 --> 02:26:58,030
you don't understand Afghanistan.

5461
02:26:58,031 --> 02:26:59,680
You're saying we're just
going to send troops in there.

5462
02:26:59,860 --> 02:27:01,700
You can't just do that like that.

5463
02:27:01,990 --> 02:27:04,090
This is like the rocky mountains.

5464
02:27:04,180 --> 02:27:05,530
I mean it's fucking crazy.

5465
02:27:05,530 --> 02:27:09,220
It's all mountains and these guys were
living out there and caves and made these

5466
02:27:09,221 --> 02:27:10,960
Taliban guys living in Cains.

5467
02:27:10,961 --> 02:27:14,350
You've got these dudes are war lords and
they got like 20 wives and then giving

5468
02:27:14,351 --> 02:27:16,030
them Viagara to get them to talk.

5469
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:20,050
They give these guys Viagara
to rat on the Taliban at.

5470
02:27:20,180 --> 02:27:20,470
Really?

5471
02:27:20,470 --> 02:27:21,101
Yes.

5472
02:27:21,101 --> 02:27:21,934
That's how they would give.

5473
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:23,320
That's how I would get them to talk.

5474
02:27:23,530 --> 02:27:24,760
They would give them Viagara.

5475
02:27:24,850 --> 02:27:26,200
That sounds like
something on the Internet.

5476
02:27:26,201 --> 02:27:27,220
That's what we know.

5477
02:27:27,221 --> 02:27:32,221
This is one of the government's main
uses of bribery or main a main main items

5478
02:27:34,330 --> 02:27:35,560
that they would bribe people with.

5479
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:36,040
Yeah,

5480
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:38,500
because he's guys who get
like 60 and they got 20 wives,

5481
02:27:38,501 --> 02:27:39,610
they can't fuck him anymore.

5482
02:27:40,540 --> 02:27:41,111
And then someone,

5483
02:27:41,111 --> 02:27:42,940
American GI comes along and he's like,

5484
02:27:42,941 --> 02:27:43,690
yeah man,

5485
02:27:43,690 --> 02:27:44,523
what do you need dude?

5486
02:27:44,530 --> 02:27:45,301
Well you know with,

5487
02:27:45,301 --> 02:27:45,971
so let's talk.

5488
02:27:45,971 --> 02:27:46,810
We got guns.

5489
02:27:46,810 --> 02:27:47,081
You know,

5490
02:27:47,081 --> 02:27:47,711
do you need guns?

5491
02:27:47,711 --> 02:27:48,041
It's like,

5492
02:27:48,041 --> 02:27:49,240
I've got plenty of guns,

5493
02:27:49,241 --> 02:27:50,074
my friend.

5494
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:50,891
And they're like,

5495
02:27:50,891 --> 02:27:51,440
do you need girls?

5496
02:27:51,440 --> 02:27:52,510
I got date twin wives,

5497
02:27:52,511 --> 02:27:54,310
my friend I know need you.

5498
02:27:55,900 --> 02:27:57,760
I got a blue pill that
makes your dick hard.

5499
02:27:58,840 --> 02:27:59,673
The stock.

5500
02:28:00,190 --> 02:28:03,040
Let's take a lift up at the light.

5501
02:28:03,190 --> 02:28:04,090
I'll tell you what I know.

5502
02:28:04,091 --> 02:28:05,920
I never liked those motherfuckers.

5503
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:08,530
Little blue pills among the way CIA wins,

5504
02:28:08,531 --> 02:28:09,670
friends and Afghanistan.

5505
02:28:09,700 --> 02:28:12,040
I thought I was having a
stroke that came on so fast.

5506
02:28:12,100 --> 02:28:12,670
Look at that.

5507
02:28:12,670 --> 02:28:15,040
Afghan chief didn't looked
older than a 60 year,

5508
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:18,790
60 odd years and his bearded face bore
the creases of a man burden with the

5509
02:28:18,791 --> 02:28:22,010
duties as tribal patriarch
and husband to for

5510
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:22,791
younger women.

5511
02:28:22,791 --> 02:28:23,061
See,

5512
02:28:23,061 --> 02:28:23,894
there you go.

5513
02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:28,280
They gave him by Hagrid Dude,

5514
02:28:28,670 --> 02:28:29,960
they gave him Viagra.

5515
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:35,080
I recently tried real viagara and real
Cialis and it's pussy shit compared to

5516
02:28:35,391 --> 02:28:37,760
the stuff you get at the gas
station and I fucked that shit.

5517
02:28:38,300 --> 02:28:38,541
Yo,

5518
02:28:38,541 --> 02:28:41,210
you were talking about on one
of the podcasts we did recently,

5519
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:41,541
he,

5520
02:28:41,541 --> 02:28:45,690
Brian would take these a boner pills
that you'd get at a gas station for the

5521
02:28:45,810 --> 02:28:46,461
closing bit,

5522
02:28:46,461 --> 02:28:46,970
right?

5523
02:28:46,970 --> 02:28:47,121
Well,

5524
02:28:47,121 --> 02:28:47,421
no,

5525
02:28:47,421 --> 02:28:47,781
he had,

5526
02:28:47,781 --> 02:28:51,440
you know how you have those things like
where there's like a little lighter

5527
02:28:51,470 --> 02:28:52,670
container and there's a breath,

5528
02:28:52,671 --> 02:28:55,490
mint container and the right when
you go to pay at the gas station,

5529
02:28:55,530 --> 02:28:58,670
there's like a porn almost where it's
like a naked girl getting fucked by.

5530
02:28:59,160 --> 02:28:59,730
It's like,

5531
02:28:59,730 --> 02:29:00,020
you know,

5532
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:01,180
blue dynamite,

5533
02:29:03,370 --> 02:29:03,980
you know,

5534
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:08,980
well these things are like a
cocktail of steroids and steroids,

5535
02:29:09,831 --> 02:29:11,060
Viagara acorns,

5536
02:29:11,061 --> 02:29:11,720
things like that.

5537
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:12,730
And then it's,

5538
02:29:12,780 --> 02:29:13,400
it's,

5539
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:15,080
what's crazy though is that I,

5540
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:17,360
this guy in a wheelchair
recently came to show,

5541
02:29:17,361 --> 02:29:18,590
he's a comedian from Chicago.

5542
02:29:18,591 --> 02:29:19,670
I can't remember his name right now.

5543
02:29:19,850 --> 02:29:20,211
And he goes,

5544
02:29:20,211 --> 02:29:21,430
I always hear about the boner post.

5545
02:29:21,431 --> 02:29:21,591
Well,

5546
02:29:21,591 --> 02:29:24,710
I get them because I'm in a
wheelchair and the retard strength,

5547
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:26,780
I want you to like have these.

5548
02:29:26,781 --> 02:29:30,020
So he gave me a whole box
of them and I took one,

5549
02:29:30,021 --> 02:29:30,290
it was like,

5550
02:29:30,290 --> 02:29:30,561
oh,

5551
02:29:30,561 --> 02:29:33,230
this isn't the retard strength.

5552
02:29:33,700 --> 02:29:34,370
Really,

5553
02:29:34,370 --> 02:29:35,270
really strong.

5554
02:29:35,330 --> 02:29:36,050
Like they're like,

5555
02:29:36,050 --> 02:29:36,350
like,

5556
02:29:36,350 --> 02:29:37,850
you know that nothing normal level.

5557
02:29:37,890 --> 02:29:38,450
Right.

5558
02:29:38,450 --> 02:29:39,283
Okay.

5559
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:40,800
That's what that says.

5560
02:29:40,910 --> 02:29:41,743
I think he's,

5561
02:29:41,870 --> 02:29:45,440
I think he said that really having a hard
time understanding what you're saying.

5562
02:29:45,510 --> 02:29:46,343
I'm sorry,

5563
02:29:46,730 --> 02:29:47,563
I'm stone.

5564
02:29:50,780 --> 02:29:51,800
So he gave me the high,

5565
02:29:52,010 --> 02:29:56,360
high end versions of them and I took
them and being used to the only the kinds

5566
02:29:56,361 --> 02:29:57,440
that you get at the store,

5567
02:29:57,590 --> 02:29:59,990
they're like really like bitch versions,

5568
02:29:59,991 --> 02:30:03,020
like of what you can
get at seven 11 for $6.

5569
02:30:03,050 --> 02:30:06,890
I just think that what you're getting
at seven 11 is a lot of illegal steroids

5570
02:30:06,891 --> 02:30:07,220
too.

5571
02:30:07,220 --> 02:30:08,031
That's what it is.

5572
02:30:08,031 --> 02:30:11,200
Like you're taking something and you're
just getting jacked up on testosterone.

5573
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:12,093
Sure.

5574
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:12,560
Maybe.

5575
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:13,720
But I'm saying if you want to,

5576
02:30:13,730 --> 02:30:14,051
if you're,

5577
02:30:14,051 --> 02:30:14,810
if you're,

5578
02:30:14,810 --> 02:30:15,770
if you're,

5579
02:30:15,771 --> 02:30:17,790
if you're going to fuck like
a 21 year old and you're like,

5580
02:30:18,290 --> 02:30:20,450
I better do something right here.

5581
02:30:20,840 --> 02:30:21,920
I'm just saying go with that one.

5582
02:30:21,921 --> 02:30:23,230
That's what I'm saying is like,

5583
02:30:23,460 --> 02:30:25,430
I appreciate the,

5584
02:30:25,431 --> 02:30:26,240
uh,

5585
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:27,050
the results.

5586
02:30:27,050 --> 02:30:28,520
Like I think it sounds like you're right,

5587
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:29,383
it's swollen.

5588
02:30:29,390 --> 02:30:32,450
It would be a good idea
to get that stuff tested.

5589
02:30:32,510 --> 02:30:36,230
Find out exactly what's in it because
I guarantee you they're not consistent.

5590
02:30:36,260 --> 02:30:36,500
I know,

5591
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:36,801
I know.

5592
02:30:36,801 --> 02:30:38,960
And if you're just getting
like just random shit from,

5593
02:30:38,961 --> 02:30:42,500
who knows where the lesion fake Viagra.

5594
02:30:42,530 --> 02:30:45,710
But after looking at 4,000
different reports from the FDA,

5595
02:30:45,740 --> 02:30:48,980
they're all just like the worst
steroids and it's just a teeny,

5596
02:30:48,981 --> 02:30:50,360
but it steroids in your Dick,

5597
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:50,841
you know,

5598
02:30:50,841 --> 02:30:55,020
it's not like it's you're pumping it in
like a needle in your arm and I'm not a

5599
02:30:55,021 --> 02:30:55,910
UFC fighter.

5600
02:30:56,150 --> 02:30:57,220
The stronger steroids,

5601
02:30:57,221 --> 02:30:57,920
there's some pretty,

5602
02:30:57,920 --> 02:30:59,720
well I don't see some of the stronger,

5603
02:30:59,870 --> 02:31:01,550
there's some really strong ones that you,

5604
02:31:01,551 --> 02:31:01,970
uh,

5605
02:31:01,970 --> 02:31:03,800
you eat their orals.

5606
02:31:04,100 --> 02:31:04,940
I think one of them,

5607
02:31:05,690 --> 02:31:06,770
if I'm not correct,

5608
02:31:06,771 --> 02:31:07,281
there's just one.

5609
02:31:07,281 --> 02:31:10,840
I knew this bodybuilder guy was insane
and he would take some shit called Anna

5610
02:31:10,850 --> 02:31:11,820
drawl 50,

5611
02:31:12,520 --> 02:31:14,960
which is supposed to be like one
of the more liver toxic ones,

5612
02:31:15,410 --> 02:31:16,820
but I can't remember whether it was,

5613
02:31:16,821 --> 02:31:17,600
um,

5614
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:20,010
whether it was a one you ate or when you

5615
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:20,873
injected,

5616
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:22,590
but the guys that were beyond that,

5617
02:31:22,591 --> 02:31:22,781
this,

5618
02:31:22,781 --> 02:31:23,431
this buddy of mine,

5619
02:31:23,431 --> 02:31:23,940
he took it,

5620
02:31:23,940 --> 02:31:25,000
he was a serious body,

5621
02:31:25,001 --> 02:31:25,740
but there was also,

5622
02:31:25,740 --> 02:31:26,100
uh,

5623
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:28,650
he became a Jiu Jitsu black
belt and if saw him now,

5624
02:31:28,770 --> 02:31:31,980
you would never believe that he was a
serious bodybuilder because he's like

5625
02:31:31,981 --> 02:31:32,820
really lean,

5626
02:31:32,821 --> 02:31:33,840
almost like a runner.

5627
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:34,921
It's like a tall guy,

5628
02:31:34,921 --> 02:31:37,410
like maybe six to really strong,

5629
02:31:37,411 --> 02:31:38,041
like super,

5630
02:31:38,041 --> 02:31:41,430
super tight grip and great Jujitsu.

5631
02:31:41,730 --> 02:31:42,270
But uh,

5632
02:31:42,270 --> 02:31:43,140
he was on this stuff,

5633
02:31:43,141 --> 02:31:44,370
this antique draw 50 shit.

5634
02:31:44,610 --> 02:31:45,061
And he said,

5635
02:31:45,061 --> 02:31:46,350
some guy said something to him at a,

5636
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:47,370
at a red light.

5637
02:31:47,610 --> 02:31:51,630
And he said he didn't even realize what
was happening until he was reaching

5638
02:31:51,631 --> 02:31:53,220
through the guy's window,

5639
02:31:53,250 --> 02:31:54,330
beating the shit out of him.

5640
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:59,190
Like he sort of like woke up in the middle
of beating the shit out of this guy,

5641
02:31:59,191 --> 02:32:00,090
parked his car.

5642
02:32:00,091 --> 02:32:00,930
Like some guy yelled at,

5643
02:32:00,931 --> 02:32:01,141
I'm like,

5644
02:32:01,141 --> 02:32:02,040
fuck you old man,

5645
02:32:02,041 --> 02:32:02,874
or something like that.

5646
02:32:02,970 --> 02:32:06,260
And he snapped and said
he didn't even read it.

5647
02:32:06,261 --> 02:32:07,170
And that's when he realized like,

5648
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:07,441
okay,

5649
02:32:07,441 --> 02:32:07,860
I can't,

5650
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:08,940
I can't be doing this anymore.

5651
02:32:09,250 --> 02:32:10,200
Holy Shit.

5652
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:12,600
And he got away with
it somehow or another,

5653
02:32:12,601 --> 02:32:15,900
he didn't get arrested or I don't
know what he did to the guy.

5654
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:17,970
I don't think this was Jujitsu training.

5655
02:32:19,050 --> 02:32:20,280
I don't want to say the guy's name,

5656
02:32:20,281 --> 02:32:22,010
but I don't think this is
when he was training Jujitsu.

5657
02:32:22,060 --> 02:32:23,040
So I think it was before,

5658
02:32:23,041 --> 02:32:24,330
I think it was just bodybuilding.

5659
02:32:25,210 --> 02:32:26,310
Holy Shit.

5660
02:32:26,311 --> 02:32:26,490
I,

5661
02:32:26,490 --> 02:32:26,850
I think,

5662
02:32:26,850 --> 02:32:27,990
and I think that's when you eat.

5663
02:32:28,530 --> 02:32:29,520
I think that's an oral one.

5664
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:34,760
So if they took that stuff and put it
in his fucking little dick pills that

5665
02:32:35,341 --> 02:32:36,000
might have a,

5666
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:37,890
it might have quite significant pop.

5667
02:32:37,960 --> 02:32:38,980
You don't Earl scaffold,

5668
02:32:39,250 --> 02:32:40,270
you know Earl [inaudible],

5669
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:43,840
he's one of my favorite people ever and
I was just on his podcast and he's like

5670
02:32:43,841 --> 02:32:44,740
the boner pill.

5671
02:32:44,741 --> 02:32:45,501
Qantas Sword.

5672
02:32:45,501 --> 02:32:46,334
Like

5673
02:32:47,250 --> 02:32:50,320
Michael is the guy just
take you to a Kennedy.

5674
02:32:50,350 --> 02:32:50,740
Yes.

5675
02:32:50,740 --> 02:32:50,861
No,

5676
02:32:50,861 --> 02:32:51,850
he just had,

5677
02:32:53,420 --> 02:32:53,880
ah,

5678
02:32:53,880 --> 02:32:54,321
oh Geez.

5679
02:32:54,321 --> 02:32:56,280
Had Tommy Tommy Mars on it,

5680
02:32:56,281 --> 02:32:57,330
which is an amazing,

5681
02:32:57,900 --> 02:32:58,651
amazing interview.

5682
02:32:58,651 --> 02:33:00,360
So I was amazing.

5683
02:33:00,361 --> 02:33:01,180
The overstate.

5684
02:33:01,180 --> 02:33:02,940
I know it is eye opening,

5685
02:33:02,941 --> 02:33:03,780
a really great interview.

5686
02:33:03,781 --> 02:33:04,620
It's interesting.

5687
02:33:04,621 --> 02:33:05,454
If you're in a comedy,

5688
02:33:05,660 --> 02:33:06,580
I wouldn't say it's amazing,

5689
02:33:06,770 --> 02:33:08,550
amazing opening eye opening,

5690
02:33:08,551 --> 02:33:10,770
how crazy it is.

5691
02:33:10,830 --> 02:33:10,941
Well,

5692
02:33:10,941 --> 02:33:12,870
that's who we were dealing
with for a long time.

5693
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:13,090
Yeah,

5694
02:33:13,090 --> 02:33:16,170
that's the number one reason why
I came back to the comedy store.

5695
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:18,480
So I was just starting to group that.

5696
02:33:19,110 --> 02:33:20,970
I was just on his podcast yesterday.

5697
02:33:21,030 --> 02:33:22,770
I was the next person after Tommy,

5698
02:33:22,830 --> 02:33:26,850
and that interview made me so mad that
I kind of blew up a little bit on on his

5699
02:33:26,851 --> 02:33:27,331
podcast,

5700
02:33:27,331 --> 02:33:28,740
but what did you really talk about?

5701
02:33:28,890 --> 02:33:33,170
Boner pills and you can
actually buy the ingredient,

5702
02:33:33,190 --> 02:33:35,820
like a lot of ingredients on
the Amazon and stuff like that,

5703
02:33:35,821 --> 02:33:38,520
that will give you the same results as
like a boner pill that are healthy and

5704
02:33:38,521 --> 02:33:40,100
stuff like that as like sink.

5705
02:33:40,110 --> 02:33:41,950
Can I stop you right here because I don't,

5706
02:33:42,010 --> 02:33:43,500
I've never needed it by Agra,

5707
02:33:43,650 --> 02:33:45,720
but I have friends that I
like you that I can't imagine.

5708
02:33:45,721 --> 02:33:47,520
Need Avaya grow or a boat or pill.

5709
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:48,331
What does it do?

5710
02:33:48,331 --> 02:33:48,750
Does it?

5711
02:33:48,750 --> 02:33:49,110
Oh No.

5712
02:33:49,110 --> 02:33:51,570
All I needed something that
doesn't make me come as fast.

5713
02:33:52,110 --> 02:33:52,470
No.

5714
02:33:52,470 --> 02:33:52,621
What?

5715
02:33:52,621 --> 02:33:53,454
That's different.

5716
02:33:54,440 --> 02:33:55,273
Alcohol.

5717
02:33:55,680 --> 02:33:55,861
No,

5718
02:33:55,861 --> 02:33:56,490
I meant well,

5719
02:33:56,490 --> 02:33:57,151
I'm with my wife.

5720
02:33:57,151 --> 02:34:01,320
Like I would love something that
made me not climax so quickly.

5721
02:34:01,340 --> 02:34:02,173
The hall,

5722
02:34:02,380 --> 02:34:07,230
well that doesn't work obviously the
last time I find that lasts for three

5723
02:34:07,231 --> 02:34:07,620
hours.

5724
02:34:07,620 --> 02:34:08,520
Everybody's different.

5725
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:11,650
But what does a biker dude,

5726
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:12,493
is it like,

5727
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:14,110
do you have a problem
getting a hard to no,

5728
02:34:14,111 --> 02:34:14,230
no,

5729
02:34:14,230 --> 02:34:15,040
I don't

5730
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:16,210
Vaso dilator.

5731
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:17,470
It's what's is.

5732
02:34:17,471 --> 02:34:21,160
It's banned in the Olympics
as a performance enhancing
drug because it has a

5733
02:34:21,161 --> 02:34:23,440
beneficial effect on athletic performance,

5734
02:34:23,441 --> 02:34:25,900
a measurable effect on
athletic performance,

5735
02:34:26,260 --> 02:34:27,520
and then it has something to do.

5736
02:34:27,610 --> 02:34:28,810
I might butcher this,

5737
02:34:29,140 --> 02:34:33,610
but with your body's
production of nitric oxide,

5738
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:34,510
I think that's what it is.

5739
02:34:34,511 --> 02:34:39,511
That stuff that's in like an o two Max
and all these comp things and that stuff

5740
02:34:40,120 --> 02:34:45,120
apparently has a beneficial effect on
a muscle and athletic performance that

5741
02:34:45,431 --> 02:34:46,810
nitric oxide stuff.

5742
02:34:46,840 --> 02:34:48,050
So you don't need it to,

5743
02:34:48,340 --> 02:34:48,760
you can,

5744
02:34:48,760 --> 02:34:50,080
you can get it to happen.

5745
02:34:50,110 --> 02:34:50,500
Yeah,

5746
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:52,570
but it's not that it doesn't,

5747
02:34:52,690 --> 02:34:53,800
what is the way it works?

5748
02:34:53,801 --> 02:34:56,660
It's not that like Brian would just
automatically get a harder out of nowhere.

5749
02:34:56,661 --> 02:34:57,640
It's just like will it,

5750
02:34:58,810 --> 02:35:01,120
you'd still have to be in the presence
for the girl that you thought was

5751
02:35:01,121 --> 02:35:03,340
attractive and you do it.

5752
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:05,440
It's just like you would normally,

5753
02:35:05,470 --> 02:35:05,891
you know,

5754
02:35:05,891 --> 02:35:06,521
be attractive,

5755
02:35:06,521 --> 02:35:07,690
started making out with someone,

5756
02:35:07,900 --> 02:35:11,020
but your Dick would get
hard as a fucking crow bar.

5757
02:35:11,110 --> 02:35:14,620
It's like everything is dialed up
to 10 it's like more like a swollen,

5758
02:35:14,621 --> 02:35:15,950
like a snake bite or big.

5759
02:35:15,951 --> 02:35:16,784
Here's the thing.

5760
02:35:17,110 --> 02:35:18,520
Here's the thing is that it's a yes,

5761
02:35:19,630 --> 02:35:20,800
your dick is maximized.

5762
02:35:21,070 --> 02:35:22,350
But here's the thing is that it,

5763
02:35:22,510 --> 02:35:23,710
it's your whole body.

5764
02:35:24,130 --> 02:35:26,020
Your whole body is experiencing this.

5765
02:35:26,021 --> 02:35:27,790
Like your muscles are experiencing this.

5766
02:35:27,940 --> 02:35:29,560
All of your muscles are experiencing this.

5767
02:35:29,561 --> 02:35:30,730
It's not just your deck.

5768
02:35:30,790 --> 02:35:32,140
That's why it's not my goal.

5769
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:33,520
It doesn't really do anything for you.

5770
02:35:34,120 --> 02:35:34,271
Well,

5771
02:35:34,271 --> 02:35:34,451
no,

5772
02:35:34,451 --> 02:35:35,284
it's not that,

5773
02:35:35,650 --> 02:35:36,780
that does not what I'm saying.

5774
02:35:36,820 --> 02:35:38,890
If you use it and run,

5775
02:35:39,220 --> 02:35:41,700
like if you did exercise
and you did something,

5776
02:35:41,730 --> 02:35:43,390
you would have like more endurance,

5777
02:35:43,420 --> 02:35:45,130
you'd have more work output.

5778
02:35:45,490 --> 02:35:49,090
It could benefit you to a
point in at least some way,

5779
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:51,460
in a measurable way that the
Olympic Committee is like nap.

5780
02:35:51,550 --> 02:35:52,360
I don't think so.

5781
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:52,771
And you,

5782
02:35:52,771 --> 02:35:54,040
you can't have it in your system.

5783
02:35:54,070 --> 02:35:55,630
I know cyclists have used it,

5784
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:56,510
you know?

5785
02:35:56,510 --> 02:35:57,040
Um,

5786
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:57,671
if I took one,

5787
02:35:57,671 --> 02:36:02,671
I would just feel like a rock star in
that my dick was bigger and I could fully

5788
02:36:03,940 --> 02:36:06,370
engorged like to the fullest.

5789
02:36:06,460 --> 02:36:06,641
See,

5790
02:36:06,641 --> 02:36:07,200
I like it.

5791
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:11,170
I like at massage parlor is because
you usually are too nervous.

5792
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:12,580
Like where'd that girl is?

5793
02:36:12,581 --> 02:36:12,821
Like,

5794
02:36:12,821 --> 02:36:16,000
like working and you can't get
hard or without touching herself,

5795
02:36:16,001 --> 02:36:17,740
you're just laying near your Dick's Grush.

5796
02:36:18,070 --> 02:36:19,060
But when you flip over,

5797
02:36:19,061 --> 02:36:21,850
you want to have at nice healthy
Dick's so she can take care of you.

5798
02:36:22,050 --> 02:36:22,290
Right.

5799
02:36:22,290 --> 02:36:23,950
And so boner pills really help out.

5800
02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:28,330
Like in situations like that where you
wouldn't have boner about encouraging

5801
02:36:28,331 --> 02:36:29,530
people to take those things,

5802
02:36:30,580 --> 02:36:32,740
you don't know who's
gonna make the next batch.

5803
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:36,460
This is the reality of having
supplements that aren't really,

5804
02:36:36,790 --> 02:36:38,770
they're not really examined the,

5805
02:36:38,771 --> 02:36:39,640
you just sell them.

5806
02:36:39,830 --> 02:36:42,880
You know what the worst thing that happens
is someone catches the fact that you

5807
02:36:42,881 --> 02:36:44,080
have a prescription drug in there,

5808
02:36:44,081 --> 02:36:45,430
like a Cialis or something like that.

5809
02:36:45,940 --> 02:36:47,050
And this is according to Aubrey.

5810
02:36:47,051 --> 02:36:49,730
I asked him about it and
he understands like the,

5811
02:36:50,270 --> 02:36:54,370
the rules on things like this and he said
that what they do is they essentially

5812
02:36:54,371 --> 02:36:58,450
just find you and these people reopen
under a different name and they just go

5813
02:36:58,451 --> 02:36:59,231
right back at it.

5814
02:36:59,231 --> 02:36:59,560
Yeah.

5815
02:36:59,560 --> 02:37:02,590
Because they develop a reputation
where people like Brian,

5816
02:37:02,591 --> 02:37:03,280
no,

5817
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:04,390
they go in,

5818
02:37:04,391 --> 02:37:07,360
there's a little thing with the fucking
lighters and the breath mints and the

5819
02:37:07,361 --> 02:37:08,051
boner pills.

5820
02:37:08,051 --> 02:37:09,040
They're right there at that.

5821
02:37:09,041 --> 02:37:09,970
Those things work.

5822
02:37:10,390 --> 02:37:11,320
That's why they're selling them.

5823
02:37:11,630 --> 02:37:13,240
Then they're not placebos.

5824
02:37:13,241 --> 02:37:17,420
They fucking work and it's easy to get
that stuff from China or wherever the

5825
02:37:17,421 --> 02:37:18,950
fuck they get it from Russia.

5826
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:21,380
I don't know whether they got
to watch out some of the China,

5827
02:37:21,470 --> 02:37:22,303
uh,

5828
02:37:22,310 --> 02:37:25,970
fake Viagra and stuff can actually
contain like poison recently.

5829
02:37:26,340 --> 02:37:27,111
That's what I'm saying,

5830
02:37:27,111 --> 02:37:27,560
dude.

5831
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:28,400
That's what I'm saying.

5832
02:37:28,430 --> 02:37:29,630
Don't be fucking around with that.

5833
02:37:29,690 --> 02:37:34,190
I mean I had some stuff that I can
still buy today that makes me trip.

5834
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:35,600
Like I started seeing visuals,

5835
02:37:35,780 --> 02:37:37,880
so I stopped with that one.

5836
02:37:37,881 --> 02:37:39,300
But I want to know what that,

5837
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:40,131
that one is.

5838
02:37:40,131 --> 02:37:42,920
So I've been waiting
for the FDA to that one.

5839
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:47,660
That's what Anderson Silva got pop
for when he got popped for steroids.

5840
02:37:47,690 --> 02:37:48,980
He wasn't taking steroids.

5841
02:37:48,981 --> 02:37:52,130
He was taking a Viagra
that was like from China.

5842
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:56,150
And when they had made this
stuff in the laboratory,

5843
02:37:56,300 --> 02:38:00,530
it was somehow or another
contaminated by steroids.

5844
02:38:00,950 --> 02:38:02,030
And he had to admit this,

5845
02:38:02,090 --> 02:38:02,870
but this is,

5846
02:38:02,870 --> 02:38:04,730
I know this from people in this camp,

5847
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:06,350
like they were talking about things.

5848
02:38:06,570 --> 02:38:07,730
This isn't a made up story.

5849
02:38:07,731 --> 02:38:09,680
It's embarrassing and it's crazy.

5850
02:38:09,681 --> 02:38:14,300
But it's totally true when you buy stuff
like from these random companies and

5851
02:38:14,301 --> 02:38:15,134
China,

5852
02:38:15,650 --> 02:38:19,190
there are some that do an awesome
job of making sure that all of the

5853
02:38:19,191 --> 02:38:19,731
ingredients,

5854
02:38:19,731 --> 02:38:21,290
whatever you're buying from them are pure.

5855
02:38:21,470 --> 02:38:22,670
But there's some that just,

5856
02:38:22,730 --> 02:38:24,620
they don't bother to
clean out the machinery.

5857
02:38:24,980 --> 02:38:29,980
So like if you have a vitamin B 12 and
right before you had the vitamin B 12

5858
02:38:30,051 --> 02:38:30,620
order,

5859
02:38:30,620 --> 02:38:31,850
they had some other stuff in there,

5860
02:38:31,851 --> 02:38:33,110
some vitamin C or whatever.

5861
02:38:33,230 --> 02:38:37,160
It could easily get mixed up in to a
measurable amount and the amount that will

5862
02:38:37,161 --> 02:38:38,390
show up in a drug test.

5863
02:38:38,660 --> 02:38:39,440
It's possible.

5864
02:38:39,440 --> 02:38:40,400
It's totally possible.

5865
02:38:40,401 --> 02:38:40,970
100%.

5866
02:38:40,970 --> 02:38:42,590
And when you looked at Anderson's results,

5867
02:38:42,591 --> 02:38:45,020
like he tested positive before the fight,

5868
02:38:45,021 --> 02:38:50,021
like outside of training and then he
tested negative like I think at the weigh

5869
02:38:51,051 --> 02:38:55,310
ins and then positive or
something along those lines.

5870
02:38:55,311 --> 02:38:56,660
Then positive after the fight.

5871
02:38:56,840 --> 02:38:57,650
It was like a,

5872
02:38:57,650 --> 02:38:57,921
it was,

5873
02:38:57,921 --> 02:38:59,150
it didn't make any sense.

5874
02:38:59,480 --> 02:39:00,630
And they were trying to figure out how,

5875
02:39:01,150 --> 02:39:02,030
how was this happening?

5876
02:39:02,031 --> 02:39:02,841
Like this doesn't make any sense.

5877
02:39:02,841 --> 02:39:06,440
Like the steroids should stay in your
system for a longer period of time.

5878
02:39:06,440 --> 02:39:08,630
It doesn't make any sense that
they would be there at one time,

5879
02:39:08,631 --> 02:39:09,590
not be there another time.

5880
02:39:09,591 --> 02:39:10,730
Like what was the variable?

5881
02:39:11,540 --> 02:39:15,350
And then Anderson had to like come out
and have like a press conference and said

5882
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:19,720
that I took this weird Viagara
shit and that's why the,

5883
02:39:19,721 --> 02:39:20,930
the tests were so odd.

5884
02:39:21,230 --> 02:39:22,460
What a weird world it is.

5885
02:39:22,461 --> 02:39:25,820
The world of like trying to figure out
what you can get away with and what you

5886
02:39:25,821 --> 02:39:27,890
can't get away with a
beat someone's ass better

5887
02:39:29,740 --> 02:39:32,270
wouldn't we were rolled the where you
going to fucking figure out that it was

5888
02:39:32,271 --> 02:39:33,200
Viagra pills?

5889
02:39:33,500 --> 02:39:34,880
Well that's all I went to was like,

5890
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:35,780
I guess he tested it.

5891
02:39:35,810 --> 02:39:36,830
What am I allergic to?

5892
02:39:37,220 --> 02:39:38,210
Type thing where you're like,

5893
02:39:38,600 --> 02:39:39,470
what did I have?

5894
02:39:39,620 --> 02:39:40,453
Oh fuck,

5895
02:39:40,520 --> 02:39:42,200
I had this indigestion one day.

5896
02:39:42,380 --> 02:39:44,310
What was that until was like as a peanuts.

5897
02:39:44,311 --> 02:39:44,601
So you're like,

5898
02:39:44,601 --> 02:39:45,434
fuck,

5899
02:39:45,540 --> 02:39:46,770
it was what a crazy world is.

5900
02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:47,601
As you're telling the story,

5901
02:39:47,601 --> 02:39:49,520
I couldn't read your shirt and I went,

5902
02:39:50,270 --> 02:39:51,470
I don't know if you posted it,

5903
02:39:51,530 --> 02:39:54,230
but Roy Jones Jr is easily,

5904
02:39:54,231 --> 02:39:55,130
in my opinion,

5905
02:39:55,131 --> 02:39:58,190
watching him fight the most
beautiful fighter that ever lived.

5906
02:39:58,310 --> 02:39:58,491
Yeah,

5907
02:39:58,491 --> 02:39:58,820
he's,

5908
02:39:58,820 --> 02:39:58,971
I,

5909
02:39:58,971 --> 02:40:01,340
if I had to choose my
all time favorite boxer,

5910
02:40:01,610 --> 02:40:04,460
either be Roy Jones Jr on Mike Tyson.

5911
02:40:04,490 --> 02:40:06,710
Those are my two all time favorite boxers.

5912
02:40:06,770 --> 02:40:10,190
Tyson's knockout sizzle
is fucking phenomenal.

5913
02:40:10,191 --> 02:40:12,620
But Roy Jones jr fighting.

5914
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:13,561
Well,

5915
02:40:13,561 --> 02:40:14,070
both of them

5916
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:17,850
were just fucking incredible
and in a different way.

5917
02:40:17,880 --> 02:40:18,061
I mean,

5918
02:40:18,061 --> 02:40:22,750
Tyson was incredible and like a violent
storm and Roy Jones Jr was just a

5919
02:40:22,760 --> 02:40:23,311
virtue.

5920
02:40:23,311 --> 02:40:23,581
Whoa.

5921
02:40:23,581 --> 02:40:28,581
So who could do shit that nobody else
could do and reinvented how to engage Roy

5922
02:40:28,770 --> 02:40:29,041
Jones Jr,

5923
02:40:29,041 --> 02:40:29,251
you know,

5924
02:40:29,251 --> 02:40:30,540
barely threw jabs,

5925
02:40:30,750 --> 02:40:30,961
right?

5926
02:40:30,961 --> 02:40:35,520
John's would throw a lead left hook that
was as fast as anybody else's jab and

5927
02:40:35,521 --> 02:40:38,280
he would crack Tudes with
that shit off the back leg.

5928
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:43,260
And he would hit dudes and you would
see their reaction to the speed of Roy's

5929
02:40:43,261 --> 02:40:44,160
punches and they'd be like,

5930
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:46,290
oh my God.

5931
02:40:46,590 --> 02:40:50,190
When they realize what a
different level he was on.

5932
02:40:50,520 --> 02:40:54,540
Like one of my favorite Roy Jones Jr
fights was Roy Jones jr versus Vinnie.

5933
02:40:54,541 --> 02:40:57,720
Patsy Enza because Vinny
Pazienza because yeah,

5934
02:40:57,721 --> 02:40:59,400
he was going way up in his weight class.

5935
02:41:00,080 --> 02:41:02,120
I mean Vinnie was a much
smaller guy and he said,

5936
02:41:02,121 --> 02:41:02,371
you know,

5937
02:41:02,371 --> 02:41:04,440
he got real big and juiced up and he's,

5938
02:41:04,770 --> 02:41:05,041
you know,

5939
02:41:05,041 --> 02:41:05,880
he's tough as shit,

5940
02:41:05,881 --> 02:41:07,140
but he was just too short.

5941
02:41:07,140 --> 02:41:08,520
It wasn't built for the weight class.

5942
02:41:08,540 --> 02:41:13,290
Vinnie pass came any fast fought Roy
Jones and it was the only round ever where

5943
02:41:13,590 --> 02:41:17,790
the copy box numbers showed the
opponent landing zero punches,

5944
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:19,493
zero.

5945
02:41:20,130 --> 02:41:24,600
Roy just lit him up like a Christmas
tree and did whatever he wanted to the

5946
02:41:24,601 --> 02:41:25,434
point where

5947
02:41:26,730 --> 02:41:28,410
Vinny couldn't manage a single punch.

5948
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:29,910
It had never been recorded before.

5949
02:41:30,210 --> 02:41:31,380
I don't know if it has sense,

5950
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:36,360
but that's how good Roy Jones was at the
time and Roy Jones was beating his ass.

5951
02:41:36,361 --> 02:41:38,730
He knocked him down and he
turned to the referee saying,

5952
02:41:38,731 --> 02:41:39,750
please stop this.

5953
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:40,831
And the referee said,

5954
02:41:40,831 --> 02:41:41,250
nope,

5955
02:41:41,250 --> 02:41:41,881
keep fighting.

5956
02:41:41,881 --> 02:41:42,210
He said,

5957
02:41:42,210 --> 02:41:43,043
all right.

5958
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:47,600
So he dove in with an uppercut cracked
and like lifting him up in the air and,

5959
02:41:47,601 --> 02:41:47,851
and,

5960
02:41:47,851 --> 02:41:49,140
and planted them on the ground.

5961
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:50,070
Holy Shit.

5962
02:41:50,070 --> 02:41:52,050
He was a fucking,

5963
02:41:52,380 --> 02:41:54,390
when he was at his prime dude,

5964
02:41:54,391 --> 02:41:56,040
he was a marvel,

5965
02:41:56,250 --> 02:41:58,020
a marvel of movement.

5966
02:41:58,290 --> 02:42:00,990
Like he had a level of movement to him.

5967
02:42:01,230 --> 02:42:06,180
Like you can say that Bernard Hopkins
might've been more fundamentally sound or

5968
02:42:06,181 --> 02:42:06,541
Julio,

5969
02:42:06,541 --> 02:42:09,530
Cesar Chavez might've had like a,

5970
02:42:09,531 --> 02:42:10,860
a more uh,

5971
02:42:10,861 --> 02:42:15,190
a more gritty in your face game cause
Roy would kind of hang on the outside to

5972
02:42:15,191 --> 02:42:18,000
pick his shots and decide what he
wanted to do when he wanted to do it.

5973
02:42:18,900 --> 02:42:22,200
But when it comes to like
movement does the best,

5974
02:42:22,210 --> 02:42:22,770
however,

5975
02:42:22,770 --> 02:42:23,491
nobody moved.

5976
02:42:23,491 --> 02:42:24,210
Like that guy,

5977
02:42:24,210 --> 02:42:25,080
nobody moved.

5978
02:42:25,081 --> 02:42:25,914
Like that guy,

5979
02:42:25,980 --> 02:42:26,211
right?

5980
02:42:26,211 --> 02:42:28,500
Jones jr there's a video of him,

5981
02:42:28,830 --> 02:42:33,830
this guy throws a punch and he counters
with a a right left like a straight

5982
02:42:34,171 --> 02:42:34,981
right and oh no,

5983
02:42:34,981 --> 02:42:35,261
it was a,

5984
02:42:35,261 --> 02:42:37,220
a left hook and a right hand like that.

5985
02:42:37,510 --> 02:42:38,370
And he counters with,

5986
02:42:38,371 --> 02:42:39,360
it's so fast,

5987
02:42:39,361 --> 02:42:42,270
like you can't even believe it's real
and it's just like one of those little

5988
02:42:42,271 --> 02:42:45,690
quick vine clips and you just
watch them go by that and you just,

5989
02:42:45,750 --> 02:42:49,170
and the guy's like central
nervous system just shut off.

5990
02:42:49,860 --> 02:42:51,420
There was a time for a few years.

5991
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:54,360
Well he was just unstoppable force.

5992
02:42:54,420 --> 02:42:55,253
I missed it.

5993
02:42:55,770 --> 02:42:57,000
I missed it there man.

5994
02:42:57,570 --> 02:42:58,170
I was there.

5995
02:42:58,170 --> 02:42:59,280
I was watching the whole time.

5996
02:42:59,550 --> 02:43:00,383
I couldn't believe it.

5997
02:43:00,810 --> 02:43:03,330
He was so much better than
everybody else at the time.

5998
02:43:03,780 --> 02:43:04,830
So much faster.

5999
02:43:04,970 --> 02:43:07,560
It was ridiculous when
he fought James Toney,

6000
02:43:07,770 --> 02:43:08,460
dude,

6001
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:09,570
he fought James.

6002
02:43:09,571 --> 02:43:10,680
Tony does the,

6003
02:43:11,890 --> 02:43:13,750
he fought the killer from Detroit.

6004
02:43:14,140 --> 02:43:18,530
He fought James Tony who was just a
slick boxer with nasty knockout powers.

6005
02:43:18,550 --> 02:43:19,450
Tough Shit.

6006
02:43:20,320 --> 02:43:23,830
And Roy Jones Jr just showed
him another level of movement.

6007
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:25,000
Just another level,

6008
02:43:25,540 --> 02:43:26,373
you know?

6009
02:43:26,670 --> 02:43:27,190
Yeah.

6010
02:43:27,190 --> 02:43:28,120
Dropped his hands.

6011
02:43:28,121 --> 02:43:32,170
And then Tony dropped his hands like in
response and then Roy leaps in with a

6012
02:43:32,171 --> 02:43:34,420
left cook cracks right in
the Chin and drop some.

6013
02:43:34,780 --> 02:43:36,290
And it was like this,

6014
02:43:36,310 --> 02:43:36,610
like,

6015
02:43:36,610 --> 02:43:37,000
like,

6016
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,290
don't fucking do what I'm doing,

6017
02:43:38,291 --> 02:43:39,040
bitch.

6018
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:41,500
Like he was just on
such a different level.

6019
02:43:42,250 --> 02:43:42,730
How's row?

6020
02:43:42,730 --> 02:43:44,500
How Royal House Roy Jones Jr.

6021
02:43:44,560 --> 02:43:44,651
I,

6022
02:43:44,651 --> 02:43:45,520
it's funny that I say that.

6023
02:43:46,150 --> 02:43:46,983
I knew

6024
02:43:49,220 --> 02:43:50,053
I was good at

6025
02:43:51,740 --> 02:43:52,300
it.

6026
02:43:52,300 --> 02:43:54,220
This is him and Vinny Pazienza band.

6027
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:56,830
This was worth around
where he gets to that zero.

6028
02:43:56,980 --> 02:43:57,251
Yeah,

6029
02:43:57,251 --> 02:43:57,810
this is

6030
02:43:57,810 --> 02:43:58,643
fourth round.

6031
02:43:59,320 --> 02:44:02,640
There's glass jar and the
Vinny Pazienza was a tough guy.

6032
02:44:02,641 --> 02:44:04,530
He knocked out my friend Dana Rosenblatt,

6033
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:08,430
who is a guy that I used to train with
back in the day in Boston under Joe Lake

6034
02:44:08,970 --> 02:44:09,361
was they,

6035
02:44:09,361 --> 02:44:09,710
uh,

6036
02:44:09,710 --> 02:44:11,700
a boxing coach that I knew from back then.

6037
02:44:11,701 --> 02:44:13,820
So I was a big fan of any patsy ends.

6038
02:44:13,910 --> 02:44:14,940
He's tough as shit,

6039
02:44:15,210 --> 02:44:18,090
but he was really like way
out of his weight class.

6040
02:44:18,360 --> 02:44:20,130
Roy was so much bigger than him,

6041
02:44:20,400 --> 02:44:21,121
so that Vinny,

6042
02:44:21,121 --> 02:44:23,970
even though he was a big guy because
he had all that muscle on him,

6043
02:44:23,971 --> 02:44:27,690
his actual frame was nowhere
near the frame of Royce,

6044
02:44:27,720 --> 02:44:27,961
you know,

6045
02:44:27,961 --> 02:44:29,100
he was more like a guy.

6046
02:44:29,490 --> 02:44:32,610
He fought a lot of like really tough
guys that lower weight class too.

6047
02:44:32,611 --> 02:44:33,271
But you look at them there,

6048
02:44:33,271 --> 02:44:34,620
he looks almost like a bodybuilder.

6049
02:44:34,970 --> 02:44:35,650
He does.

6050
02:44:35,650 --> 02:44:36,500
Finney pass.

6051
02:44:36,610 --> 02:44:36,920
Uh,

6052
02:44:36,920 --> 02:44:41,920
and his training partner came
out to a show that I did in,

6053
02:44:43,030 --> 02:44:43,520
uh,

6054
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:45,290
New Jersey with Mr Sandman.

6055
02:44:47,390 --> 02:44:48,230
I think I want to say.

6056
02:44:48,231 --> 02:44:49,064
That's right.

6057
02:44:49,070 --> 02:44:50,200
Dude is crazy watching

6058
02:44:50,200 --> 02:44:51,033
this.

6059
02:44:51,310 --> 02:44:52,810
You forget how fast Roy was.

6060
02:44:53,890 --> 02:44:55,420
There's just no one liked him at the time,

6061
02:44:55,421 --> 02:44:55,840
man.

6062
02:44:55,840 --> 02:44:56,201
And you know,

6063
02:44:56,201 --> 02:45:00,190
one of the things that really messed
with Roy was that when Roy Nelson was in

6064
02:45:00,191 --> 02:45:01,090
his prime,

6065
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:04,390
there was a guy named Gerald
Mcclellan and Gerald Mcclellan was,

6066
02:45:04,700 --> 02:45:07,060
I want to say he was a
light heavyweight champion.

6067
02:45:07,570 --> 02:45:08,410
Gerald McClellan.

6068
02:45:08,411 --> 02:45:09,190
How do I know that name?

6069
02:45:09,190 --> 02:45:12,550
Gerald McClellan was a famous
boxer who was a world champion.

6070
02:45:12,551 --> 02:45:13,540
I want to say light heavyweight,

6071
02:45:13,541 --> 02:45:13,901
but I might,

6072
02:45:13,901 --> 02:45:15,160
I might be incorrect.

6073
02:45:15,820 --> 02:45:17,440
And Gerald was,

6074
02:45:17,441 --> 02:45:18,100
uh,

6075
02:45:18,100 --> 02:45:20,830
one of the guys from the Croc
Jim under manual Stewart.

6076
02:45:21,170 --> 02:45:21,490
Okay.

6077
02:45:21,490 --> 02:45:23,260
He was just Merkin people,

6078
02:45:23,261 --> 02:45:23,591
man.

6079
02:45:23,591 --> 02:45:24,550
He was a nasty,

6080
02:45:24,551 --> 02:45:25,540
he was so good.

6081
02:45:26,050 --> 02:45:28,150
And he fought this dude named Nigel Benn.

6082
02:45:28,190 --> 02:45:29,470
They fought in Italy or in,

6083
02:45:29,471 --> 02:45:30,000
uh,

6084
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:30,370
uh,

6085
02:45:30,370 --> 02:45:31,203
England rather.

6086
02:45:31,900 --> 02:45:34,690
And it was his why I
believe it was England wild,

6087
02:45:34,691 --> 02:45:36,070
crazy ass fight.

6088
02:45:36,670 --> 02:45:40,240
And a Nigel Benn went through the
ropes in the first round and cheer on

6089
02:45:40,241 --> 02:45:41,830
Mcclellan was just putting it on him.

6090
02:45:42,310 --> 02:45:44,080
And then later in the fight,

6091
02:45:44,081 --> 02:45:45,100
something happened.

6092
02:45:45,380 --> 02:45:45,820
Um,

6093
02:45:45,820 --> 02:45:48,700
there was like a clash of
heads and Nigel Benn went,

6094
02:45:48,701 --> 02:45:49,211
or a,

6095
02:45:49,211 --> 02:45:52,540
and then Jeremy Mclellan went down to
one knee and then he quit the fight and

6096
02:45:52,541 --> 02:45:52,841
they were like,

6097
02:45:52,841 --> 02:45:53,591
we can't believe this.

6098
02:45:53,591 --> 02:45:54,424
The fights over.

6099
02:45:54,730 --> 02:45:59,200
And then he collapsed in his corner and
he had some serious brain bleeding man

6100
02:45:59,740 --> 02:46:00,131
and,

6101
02:46:00,131 --> 02:46:00,431
uh,

6102
02:46:00,431 --> 02:46:03,220
went to the hospital and they
did their best to alleviate it.

6103
02:46:03,221 --> 02:46:05,140
But to this day he's blind.

6104
02:46:05,170 --> 02:46:06,310
He can't walk.

6105
02:46:06,430 --> 02:46:07,720
He's in a wheelchair,

6106
02:46:07,930 --> 02:46:08,800
he's all fucked up.

6107
02:46:08,801 --> 02:46:09,531
He has a very,

6108
02:46:09,531 --> 02:46:10,280
very short

6109
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:11,690
memory of life,

6110
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:11,991
you know,

6111
02:46:11,991 --> 02:46:12,310
of a,

6112
02:46:12,310 --> 02:46:16,490
of who he was and his capacities
been like radically diminished.

6113
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:17,540
Uh,

6114
02:46:17,540 --> 02:46:18,320
uh,

6115
02:46:18,320 --> 02:46:18,770
but he was,

6116
02:46:18,770 --> 02:46:21,020
he was the guy that people
were saying one day,

6117
02:46:21,021 --> 02:46:21,621
Roy Jones,

6118
02:46:21,621 --> 02:46:23,480
Jr and Gerald Mcclellan
are going to fight.

6119
02:46:23,690 --> 02:46:24,710
It's gonna be crazy.

6120
02:46:24,711 --> 02:46:26,120
Cause Jerrel was a monster.

6121
02:46:26,570 --> 02:46:31,040
Gerald was a monster and now you
know that Gerald got fucked up.

6122
02:46:32,060 --> 02:46:34,220
I think it affected Roy Jones.

6123
02:46:34,370 --> 02:46:37,460
I think it affected him like
psychologically where he realized like,

6124
02:46:37,461 --> 02:46:37,671
Hey,

6125
02:46:37,671 --> 02:46:38,990
that could happen to that guy.

6126
02:46:39,290 --> 02:46:40,400
That can happen to me too,

6127
02:46:40,810 --> 02:46:41,121
you know?

6128
02:46:41,121 --> 02:46:43,760
And so he fought a lot more smart,

6129
02:46:43,850 --> 02:46:45,080
took less risks,

6130
02:46:45,170 --> 02:46:45,710
you know?

6131
02:46:45,710 --> 02:46:46,730
But how many concussions,

6132
02:46:46,731 --> 02:46:47,271
like I said,

6133
02:46:47,271 --> 02:46:47,591
I don't know about,

6134
02:46:47,591 --> 02:46:48,770
I started this before.

6135
02:46:49,010 --> 02:46:50,630
How many concussions do
you think is too many?

6136
02:46:51,350 --> 02:46:53,450
It's a good question because I've had,

6137
02:46:53,451 --> 02:46:54,590
I definitely had seven,

6138
02:46:55,510 --> 02:46:55,870
I think.

6139
02:46:55,870 --> 02:46:56,900
And he's a grown man.

6140
02:46:56,901 --> 02:46:58,280
Has to at least have five

6141
02:47:01,220 --> 02:47:02,540
by the time you're 18.

6142
02:47:03,080 --> 02:47:03,860
Um,

6143
02:47:03,860 --> 02:47:05,680
I definitely had at least by,

6144
02:47:05,681 --> 02:47:06,830
but by the time I was 18,

6145
02:47:06,831 --> 02:47:08,900
I think I gave one to
myself the other day.

6146
02:47:08,990 --> 02:47:10,160
I bent down,

6147
02:47:10,340 --> 02:47:11,270
I told you about this.

6148
02:47:11,330 --> 02:47:12,350
I haven't been down in my happy,

6149
02:47:12,380 --> 02:47:13,370
like a sleigh bed thing,

6150
02:47:13,371 --> 02:47:14,204
like a wooden thing.

6151
02:47:14,250 --> 02:47:18,050
It just cracked my head really hard on
the corner and like picking up a shoe,

6152
02:47:18,290 --> 02:47:18,470
like,

6153
02:47:18,470 --> 02:47:19,790
and I saw the flash of light.

6154
02:47:19,820 --> 02:47:20,750
I just laid down.

6155
02:47:20,751 --> 02:47:21,010
I'm like,

6156
02:47:21,010 --> 02:47:21,231
all right,

6157
02:47:21,231 --> 02:47:22,670
I'm not passing or not passing out.

6158
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:23,271
Yeah.

6159
02:47:23,271 --> 02:47:24,590
You probably give yourself a concussion.

6160
02:47:24,591 --> 02:47:25,424
Yeah.

6161
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:26,510
Um,

6162
02:47:26,510 --> 02:47:26,920
I don't know.

6163
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:29,750
You'd have to talk to a test.

6164
02:47:30,260 --> 02:47:32,750
I don't know if you had to ballpark it.

6165
02:47:33,050 --> 02:47:33,171
Oh,

6166
02:47:33,171 --> 02:47:33,500
bar.

6167
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:34,400
I'll ballpark mine that.

6168
02:47:34,460 --> 02:47:35,720
I've had a couple for sure.

6169
02:47:35,810 --> 02:47:37,190
I've definitely had a couple,

6170
02:47:37,730 --> 02:47:39,250
but like I think everyone's had a car.

6171
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:39,790
I mean like I've,

6172
02:47:39,790 --> 02:47:41,240
I've had a couple of go to the hospital,

6173
02:47:41,241 --> 02:47:42,000
a couple,

6174
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:42,590
you know,

6175
02:47:42,590 --> 02:47:45,710
I've had two definitive ones ride
to go to a hospital for them.

6176
02:47:45,990 --> 02:47:50,150
See the problem with sparring all the
time is you get them and you don't know if

6177
02:47:50,151 --> 02:47:52,580
you got them or not because
you're not going to a doctor.

6178
02:47:52,910 --> 02:47:55,760
So there was nights where I would
just lay in bed and my head would be

6179
02:47:55,761 --> 02:47:56,594
throbbing,

6180
02:47:56,810 --> 02:47:57,100
you know,

6181
02:47:57,100 --> 02:47:58,160
and I just,

6182
02:47:58,430 --> 02:48:02,240
me and some other meat had beaten the
fuck out of each other in the gym.

6183
02:48:02,600 --> 02:48:04,580
Just doing boxing,

6184
02:48:04,581 --> 02:48:06,260
sparring or kickboxing sparring.

6185
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:07,040
Yeah,

6186
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:08,040
that's there.

6187
02:48:08,090 --> 02:48:11,470
There had to be a bunch that had
to be like three or four in there.

6188
02:48:11,670 --> 02:48:12,830
When your heart problem memory,

6189
02:48:13,390 --> 02:48:14,390
my memory is excellent.

6190
02:48:14,570 --> 02:48:15,403
Yeah.

6191
02:48:15,410 --> 02:48:15,651
It's,

6192
02:48:15,651 --> 02:48:19,190
and it's only excellent about
things I care about though.

6193
02:48:19,310 --> 02:48:19,850
I have a,

6194
02:48:19,850 --> 02:48:21,170
but that's just my mind.

6195
02:48:21,230 --> 02:48:21,800
I just don't,

6196
02:48:21,800 --> 02:48:23,180
when I don't give a fuck about something,

6197
02:48:23,181 --> 02:48:24,230
like it's gone.

6198
02:48:24,350 --> 02:48:24,950
I just don't,

6199
02:48:24,950 --> 02:48:26,900
I have developed this over the years.

6200
02:48:26,901 --> 02:48:27,734
It's just my,

6201
02:48:28,130 --> 02:48:28,461
my,

6202
02:48:28,461 --> 02:48:28,790
uh,

6203
02:48:28,790 --> 02:48:30,320
style of focusing on things.

6204
02:48:30,320 --> 02:48:31,580
If I don't give a fuck about something,

6205
02:48:31,581 --> 02:48:32,990
I don't pay any attention to it.

6206
02:48:33,020 --> 02:48:35,210
I just can't because I know how,

6207
02:48:35,630 --> 02:48:36,021
you know,

6208
02:48:36,021 --> 02:48:37,130
I know how my brain works.

6209
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:38,600
So what I know about,

6210
02:48:38,601 --> 02:48:41,150
I know about and what I
don't give a fuck about.

6211
02:48:41,330 --> 02:48:42,080
What was it?

6212
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:42,913
I don't remember.

6213
02:48:43,100 --> 02:48:44,420
I don't just don't remember things.

6214
02:48:44,990 --> 02:48:46,850
I remember things that
are super important,

6215
02:48:47,270 --> 02:48:49,130
but it's never like I look at
the fucking where my car is.

6216
02:48:49,220 --> 02:48:49,730
Oh wait,

6217
02:48:49,730 --> 02:48:50,570
where the fuck my car?

6218
02:48:51,230 --> 02:48:51,980
No.

6219
02:48:51,980 --> 02:48:52,281
Yeah.

6220
02:48:52,281 --> 02:48:52,550
Like,

6221
02:48:52,550 --> 02:48:53,050
I dunno,

6222
02:48:53,050 --> 02:48:54,200
I feel like I've had,

6223
02:48:54,230 --> 02:48:57,170
I've definitely feel like I might
be on the upside of concussions,

6224
02:48:57,710 --> 02:48:59,880
but do you mean by the other gang?

6225
02:48:59,900 --> 02:49:01,730
I'm on the higher end
of the higher end from,

6226
02:49:02,330 --> 02:49:03,163
uh,

6227
02:49:03,380 --> 02:49:04,213
um,

6228
02:49:04,370 --> 02:49:06,170
if you're not experiencing any problems,

6229
02:49:06,171 --> 02:49:07,040
I wouldn't worry about it.

6230
02:49:07,140 --> 02:49:08,040
I think experiencing

6231
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:09,570
problems would be pretty obvious.

6232
02:49:09,860 --> 02:49:10,410
Yeah.

6233
02:49:10,410 --> 02:49:15,410
Once you start having like real problems
like memory problems or if you heard of

6234
02:49:15,421 --> 02:49:15,930
um,

6235
02:49:15,930 --> 02:49:19,680
the guy who was the quarterback
for the Chicago bears.

6236
02:49:19,710 --> 02:49:20,430
Jim McMann.

6237
02:49:20,430 --> 02:49:21,160
Yeah.

6238
02:49:21,160 --> 02:49:21,710
For Tinder.

6239
02:49:21,710 --> 02:49:23,010
Perry was that the test?

6240
02:49:23,011 --> 02:49:23,880
If I could remember his name,

6241
02:49:23,910 --> 02:49:25,620
I was trying to remember
his name as I was saying it,

6242
02:49:26,010 --> 02:49:26,970
but he was the,

6243
02:49:26,971 --> 02:49:27,271
uh,

6244
02:49:27,271 --> 02:49:27,481
you know,

6245
02:49:27,481 --> 02:49:28,350
the star of the Superbowl.

6246
02:49:28,351 --> 02:49:30,780
That guy was an animal and
now he's all fucked up.

6247
02:49:30,781 --> 02:49:33,390
There was a sports illustrated article
I read about them when they're talking

6248
02:49:33,391 --> 02:49:33,691
about,

6249
02:49:33,691 --> 02:49:34,050
uh,

6250
02:49:34,050 --> 02:49:36,120
he would just like
forget what he was doing.

6251
02:49:36,150 --> 02:49:39,410
He'd be in the middle of his house and
just not know why he's there or where,

6252
02:49:39,420 --> 02:49:40,241
where he's going.

6253
02:49:40,241 --> 02:49:41,490
He might have his keys in his hand,

6254
02:49:41,491 --> 02:49:41,921
not know where,

6255
02:49:41,921 --> 02:49:45,930
where was headed to and he knows he's got
something going on and Brett Farve got

6256
02:49:45,931 --> 02:49:46,870
that shit coming down the line.

6257
02:49:46,950 --> 02:49:47,641
100%,

6258
02:49:47,641 --> 02:49:48,000
man,

6259
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:48,833
they all have it.

6260
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:50,850
You're in there in the arena,

6261
02:49:50,870 --> 02:49:53,820
you're clashing heads and
they came up old school,

6262
02:49:53,821 --> 02:49:56,460
those guys came up before
they really understood CTE.

6263
02:49:56,750 --> 02:49:58,080
They came up right now,

6264
02:49:58,130 --> 02:49:59,990
if you're not a hard
Norse knows quarterback,

6265
02:50:00,220 --> 02:50:01,070
then you're not shit.

6266
02:50:01,150 --> 02:50:02,810
What are you going to
be fucking Joe Montana?

6267
02:50:03,020 --> 02:50:05,240
You're going to be earn your money
because you live in Milwaukee.

6268
02:50:06,070 --> 02:50:07,310
It's fucking hard sport,

6269
02:50:07,311 --> 02:50:07,551
dude.

6270
02:50:07,551 --> 02:50:09,320
There's no way around
that sport being hard.

6271
02:50:09,330 --> 02:50:12,860
You get the biggest super athletes in
the world and their sprint in your way

6272
02:50:12,970 --> 02:50:13,550
sprint,

6273
02:50:13,550 --> 02:50:14,383
and

6274
02:50:17,030 --> 02:50:21,290
some of those guys are bigger and stronger
and faster than humans have ever been

6275
02:50:21,410 --> 02:50:22,160
ever,

6276
02:50:22,160 --> 02:50:24,440
and they're trying to get you
cause you've got that ball.

6277
02:50:25,760 --> 02:50:26,050
Dude.

6278
02:50:26,050 --> 02:50:28,960
I couldn't even jump onto my
side right now and not get hurt.

6279
02:50:29,540 --> 02:50:31,960
Like if they said just jump on your side.

6280
02:50:32,290 --> 02:50:33,760
He'll hold a football
and jump on your side.

6281
02:50:33,910 --> 02:50:37,600
I've broken a rib diving for
something and landed on my arm wrong.

6282
02:50:38,110 --> 02:50:38,891
In a lot of ways,

6283
02:50:38,891 --> 02:50:39,410
you've got to think

6284
02:50:39,410 --> 02:50:44,410
like playing football is one of the most
courageous sports because at least in a

6285
02:50:44,691 --> 02:50:48,080
fight you only have one dude and
if you're better than that guy,

6286
02:50:48,081 --> 02:50:49,520
you can control the action.

6287
02:50:49,521 --> 02:50:50,590
If you understand what's going on,

6288
02:50:50,610 --> 02:50:52,250
you can control it to a certain extent.

6289
02:50:52,310 --> 02:50:52,940
Yeah.

6290
02:50:52,940 --> 02:50:56,540
Like Bernard Hopkins is still
fighting into his fifties right?

6291
02:50:56,541 --> 02:50:57,380
He's 50 now.

6292
02:50:57,410 --> 02:51:00,500
He's still fighting and he's
still like at a world class level.

6293
02:51:00,680 --> 02:51:03,770
You know he beat some guy
when he was 49 for a title.

6294
02:51:04,110 --> 02:51:04,310
I mean,

6295
02:51:04,310 --> 02:51:05,061
this is insane,

6296
02:51:05,061 --> 02:51:05,330
right?

6297
02:51:05,330 --> 02:51:05,510
Yeah.

6298
02:51:05,510 --> 02:51:06,343
Why does he do that?

6299
02:51:06,350 --> 02:51:08,570
He does it because he
can control the action.

6300
02:51:08,571 --> 02:51:12,740
He controls it like he makes sure that
he's in the right position at all times.

6301
02:51:12,890 --> 02:51:15,320
He's constantly controlling
exactly what's going on.

6302
02:51:16,090 --> 02:51:16,721
Dot Hopkins.

6303
02:51:16,721 --> 02:51:17,410
Is it only black?

6304
02:51:17,410 --> 02:51:18,730
Our wives ever wanted the fuck.

6305
02:51:18,790 --> 02:51:20,770
Oh Jesus Christ.

6306
02:51:21,290 --> 02:51:21,911
Let's wrap it up.

6307
02:51:21,911 --> 02:51:22,331
Everybody.

6308
02:51:22,331 --> 02:51:23,164
I'm at the Irma.

6309
02:51:24,320 --> 02:51:24,750
This,

6310
02:51:24,750 --> 02:51:26,020
you write it down now.

6311
02:51:26,021 --> 02:51:26,291
We were.

6312
02:51:26,291 --> 02:51:26,800
We were.

6313
02:51:26,800 --> 02:51:27,820
We were sitting on the couch.

6314
02:51:28,450 --> 02:51:29,283
Whoa.

6315
02:51:29,320 --> 02:51:30,190
I know hard though.

6316
02:51:30,200 --> 02:51:31,310
It's just an interesting guy.

6317
02:51:31,311 --> 02:51:33,090
Out of all the guys that she got a named,

6318
02:51:33,100 --> 02:51:34,240
it was Bernard Hopkins.

6319
02:51:34,630 --> 02:51:35,770
Did you get hard when
you thought about it?

6320
02:51:35,860 --> 02:51:36,693
No.

6321
02:51:38,450 --> 02:51:39,320
No,

6322
02:51:39,640 --> 02:51:40,480
not at all.

6323
02:51:42,270 --> 02:51:43,150
Give me a Drake.

6324
02:51:45,490 --> 02:51:46,770
What does she went?

6325
02:51:46,790 --> 02:51:47,561
Lenny Kravitz would,

6326
02:51:47,561 --> 02:51:48,370
that'd be intimidating.

6327
02:51:48,370 --> 02:51:49,121
I saw his dick.

6328
02:51:49,121 --> 02:51:49,681
I can beat it.

6329
02:51:49,681 --> 02:51:50,514
So,

6330
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:52,300
oh my God.

6331
02:51:54,340 --> 02:51:55,330
Especially with some zinc.

6332
02:51:55,560 --> 02:51:56,230
Yeah,

6333
02:51:56,230 --> 02:51:56,711
with Lenny.

6334
02:51:56,711 --> 02:51:57,491
With those pants,

6335
02:51:57,491 --> 02:51:58,500
like that was ridiculous.

6336
02:51:59,220 --> 02:51:59,770
What was,

6337
02:51:59,770 --> 02:52:01,270
what's hilarious about it was like,

6338
02:52:01,271 --> 02:52:03,520
it almost seemed like a Cgi Dick.

6339
02:52:03,760 --> 02:52:05,320
Like he came out so perfectly,

6340
02:52:05,560 --> 02:52:06,030
I didn't kind

6341
02:52:06,030 --> 02:52:07,120
of like half talk.

6342
02:52:07,330 --> 02:52:07,601
No,

6343
02:52:07,601 --> 02:52:07,901
it went,

6344
02:52:07,901 --> 02:52:08,740
hello.

6345
02:52:09,220 --> 02:52:10,520
50 tend to have a

6346
02:52:12,520 --> 02:52:12,930
jack.

6347
02:52:12,930 --> 02:52:13,763
Exactly.

6348
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:15,820
It just jumped out of nowhere.

6349
02:52:16,330 --> 02:52:16,661
I mean,

6350
02:52:16,661 --> 02:52:18,230
his pants ripped and his dick went,

6351
02:52:18,250 --> 02:52:18,851
how I,

6352
02:52:18,851 --> 02:52:19,684
yeah.

6353
02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:22,510
[inaudible] be better unprepared.

6354
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:24,430
Like I need to prepare mine to present it,

6355
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:27,130
but fucking I saw his dick.

6356
02:52:27,131 --> 02:52:27,461
I was like,

6357
02:52:27,461 --> 02:52:28,294
I can beat that.

6358
02:52:28,450 --> 02:52:28,751
Yeah.

6359
02:52:28,751 --> 02:52:31,510
It seemed like it was like
a dick radar in some ways.

6360
02:52:31,570 --> 02:52:32,381
Like on Facebook,

6361
02:52:32,381 --> 02:52:33,130
like all the guys going,

6362
02:52:33,130 --> 02:52:33,370
Ooh,

6363
02:52:33,370 --> 02:52:33,941
whatever man.

6364
02:52:33,941 --> 02:52:35,200
He's got a huge Dick.

6365
02:52:35,201 --> 02:52:35,621
And you're like,

6366
02:52:35,621 --> 02:52:35,861
oh,

6367
02:52:35,861 --> 02:52:38,110
what now we know what your Dick Sizes.

6368
02:52:38,111 --> 02:52:39,220
That's what the job was.

6369
02:52:39,221 --> 02:52:40,054
Warrior.

6370
02:52:40,570 --> 02:52:40,920
They're like,

6371
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:41,110
oh,

6372
02:52:41,110 --> 02:52:42,400
they're just saying
that because he's black

6373
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:44,120
too.

6374
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:44,921
If he was a white car,

6375
02:52:44,921 --> 02:52:45,600
they would just say,

6376
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:46,950
mark his dick did mock it.

6377
02:52:46,980 --> 02:52:47,813
I mean,

6378
02:52:47,950 --> 02:52:49,420
you heard about Justin Bieber's Dick?

6379
02:52:49,900 --> 02:52:50,121
No,

6380
02:52:50,121 --> 02:52:50,581
I haven't heard of.

6381
02:52:50,581 --> 02:52:51,050
I was day.

6382
02:52:51,050 --> 02:52:51,883
Well,

6383
02:52:52,480 --> 02:52:52,680
yeah,

6384
02:52:52,680 --> 02:52:53,180
he's,

6385
02:52:53,180 --> 02:52:55,570
he has a massive hog apparently.

6386
02:52:55,960 --> 02:52:57,040
Now you saw it.

6387
02:52:57,060 --> 02:52:57,320
Yeah.

6388
02:52:57,320 --> 02:52:57,521
Oh,

6389
02:52:57,521 --> 02:52:58,270
I googled it.

6390
02:52:58,270 --> 02:53:00,010
I looked for Justin Bieber's
Dick and then googled.

6391
02:53:00,011 --> 02:53:01,240
How old is Justin Bieber?

6392
02:53:01,540 --> 02:53:02,600
Sort Dick,

6393
02:53:03,430 --> 02:53:03,761
but like,

6394
02:53:03,761 --> 02:53:04,040
yeah,

6395
02:53:04,040 --> 02:53:07,870
apparently there's pictures of him on a
beach naked and he's fucking hung like a

6396
02:53:07,871 --> 02:53:08,704
horse.

6397
02:53:08,890 --> 02:53:10,300
No one says a fucking word,

6398
02:53:10,301 --> 02:53:11,950
but everyone says Lenny Kravitz,

6399
02:53:11,951 --> 02:53:12,910
little tiny Dick.

6400
02:53:13,060 --> 02:53:14,950
There's massive fucking bullshit,

6401
02:53:14,951 --> 02:53:15,290
man.

6402
02:53:15,290 --> 02:53:15,490
Very.

6403
02:53:15,490 --> 02:53:17,100
You seem angry cause he seem angry.

6404
02:53:17,670 --> 02:53:18,940
How much time we have left in the podcast?

6405
02:53:18,950 --> 02:53:20,770
I was like seven minutes left.

6406
02:53:20,771 --> 02:53:21,281
Come on.

6407
02:53:21,281 --> 02:53:22,240
Why so upset.

6408
02:53:22,300 --> 02:53:22,630
I'm no,

6409
02:53:22,630 --> 02:53:23,171
I'm not upset.

6410
02:53:23,171 --> 02:53:23,440
I'm just,

6411
02:53:23,440 --> 02:53:23,920
I'm not.

6412
02:53:23,920 --> 02:53:24,970
There's no fucking,

6413
02:53:24,971 --> 02:53:26,500
I have no connection to either were Dick.

6414
02:53:26,501 --> 02:53:30,070
I'm just saying it seems like a
weird thing to have on your mind.

6415
02:53:30,450 --> 02:53:31,060
It's the point.

6416
02:53:31,060 --> 02:53:31,640
I mean you're,

6417
02:53:31,640 --> 02:53:32,170
you know,

6418
02:53:32,170 --> 02:53:32,531
beepers,

6419
02:53:32,531 --> 02:53:33,251
deck father,

6420
02:53:33,251 --> 02:53:34,090
you have children,

6421
02:53:34,091 --> 02:53:35,290
you've been traveling the world.

6422
02:53:35,560 --> 02:53:39,490
You were on a moped in Vietnam and a
rice patty and we were talking on a cell

6423
02:53:39,491 --> 02:53:39,791
phone,

6424
02:53:39,791 --> 02:53:40,660
the other side of the world.

6425
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:42,190
These are like amazing,

6426
02:53:42,191 --> 02:53:43,210
amazing experiences.

6427
02:53:43,420 --> 02:53:43,631
Hey,

6428
02:53:43,631 --> 02:53:45,670
you are his dick is chuck.

6429
02:53:46,510 --> 02:53:47,490
I'm a grassroots guy.

6430
02:53:48,230 --> 02:53:49,840
Do you hate the color of your deck?

6431
02:53:50,230 --> 02:53:51,063
I wish I could.

6432
02:53:51,100 --> 02:53:51,700
I wish I could.

6433
02:53:51,700 --> 02:53:55,700
I always say made Dick Cream to jerk
off with so that it was like Shane,

6434
02:53:55,720 --> 02:53:59,380
your Dick to a perfect
side body feel like this.

6435
02:53:59,381 --> 02:54:01,820
Like Oh yeah,

6436
02:54:02,530 --> 02:54:07,000
I've actually thought about as
an a Avention Dick for real.

6437
02:54:07,250 --> 02:54:08,140
I'm dead serious.

6438
02:54:08,350 --> 02:54:08,980
Wow.

6439
02:54:08,980 --> 02:54:10,750
Like you go into a
dermatologist and you're like,

6440
02:54:10,780 --> 02:54:10,961
hey,

6441
02:54:10,961 --> 02:54:11,290
let's,

6442
02:54:11,290 --> 02:54:12,280
what if we had like a,

6443
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:17,320
like a stripping material just to like
fucking make it perfect and you give it

6444
02:54:17,321 --> 02:54:17,770
to a guy,

6445
02:54:17,770 --> 02:54:17,951
hey,

6446
02:54:17,951 --> 02:54:21,540
once a month jack off of this new Dick
will be like fucking captain Griffin.

6447
02:54:21,580 --> 02:54:22,180
Brand new.

6448
02:54:22,180 --> 02:54:22,400
Yeah,

6449
02:54:22,400 --> 02:54:24,760
but I think you would miss your veins,

6450
02:54:25,610 --> 02:54:26,443
right?

6451
02:54:26,470 --> 02:54:26,860
Yeah.

6452
02:54:26,860 --> 02:54:28,300
If you had just like a smooth,

6453
02:54:28,301 --> 02:54:30,520
weird fake cylinder looking deck,

6454
02:54:30,550 --> 02:54:32,860
even if it felt good
like an Andy Warhol Dick,

6455
02:54:33,370 --> 02:54:34,090
what do you prefer?

6456
02:54:34,090 --> 02:54:35,020
Here's perfect example.

6457
02:54:35,170 --> 02:54:40,170
Do you prefer big stretched
out fake tits or big real tits?

6458
02:54:41,980 --> 02:54:42,071
Oh,

6459
02:54:42,071 --> 02:54:42,390
big,

6460
02:54:42,390 --> 02:54:43,900
real big.

6461
02:54:44,470 --> 02:54:45,160
Why?

6462
02:54:45,160 --> 02:54:47,510
Because a real cause when you've
tried to go to the nipple,

6463
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:48,500
it slips away from you.

6464
02:54:48,530 --> 02:54:50,050
Like someone tried to get
to a different arcade,

6465
02:54:50,051 --> 02:54:52,540
grabs your dick and it
feels like a FedEx tube

6466
02:54:55,790 --> 02:55:00,790
this perfectly round and smooth and you
just want to fucking stick a fishing rod

6467
02:55:01,241 --> 02:55:02,074
in there.

6468
02:55:02,740 --> 02:55:04,890
I said a tube for mailing things.

6469
02:55:05,300 --> 02:55:06,081
That's not a dick.

6470
02:55:06,081 --> 02:55:06,351
Dick's,

6471
02:55:06,351 --> 02:55:07,430
you're supposed to be uneven.

6472
02:55:07,431 --> 02:55:08,360
Just like nipples.

6473
02:55:08,630 --> 02:55:09,050
Like if,

6474
02:55:09,050 --> 02:55:11,660
if you got like if you
look at a girl's nipple,

6475
02:55:11,670 --> 02:55:12,503
it's the,

6476
02:55:12,670 --> 02:55:14,090
if you get really close to it,

6477
02:55:14,091 --> 02:55:15,290
like a magnifying glass,

6478
02:55:15,380 --> 02:55:16,550
it's chaos.

6479
02:55:16,700 --> 02:55:17,990
It's all sorts of stuff going on there.

6480
02:55:17,991 --> 02:55:19,370
The skin is all crazy.

6481
02:55:19,371 --> 02:55:19,760
Like,

6482
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:24,760
like the butt of an artichoke artichoke
heart mark and says loose Morgan Freeman

6483
02:55:25,431 --> 02:55:26,420
moles or whatever.

6484
02:55:26,420 --> 02:55:26,791
That's fine.

6485
02:55:26,791 --> 02:55:29,060
Smalls are these little
dots all around it,

6486
02:55:29,360 --> 02:55:29,630
you know?

6487
02:55:29,630 --> 02:55:31,700
But it's beautiful in its imperfection.

6488
02:55:31,701 --> 02:55:33,680
That's like half of the thrill of it.

6489
02:55:33,890 --> 02:55:36,650
If it was just completely doll,

6490
02:55:36,651 --> 02:55:40,780
like and smooth on the nipple
and then smooth and the area,

6491
02:55:40,781 --> 02:55:44,240
oh La and then the breasts
where there's no veins,

6492
02:55:44,420 --> 02:55:45,253
there was it,

6493
02:55:45,440 --> 02:55:46,910
it was just smooth,

6494
02:55:46,940 --> 02:55:47,480
like a,

6495
02:55:47,480 --> 02:55:48,980
like a bowl of Jello,

6496
02:55:49,010 --> 02:55:50,030
like a Broadway show.

6497
02:55:50,080 --> 02:55:50,390
He said,

6498
02:55:50,390 --> 02:55:50,750
wow,

6499
02:55:50,750 --> 02:55:52,190
like a fucking robot man.

6500
02:55:52,220 --> 02:55:53,180
You know we didn't want that.

6501
02:55:53,210 --> 02:55:54,030
You wouldn't want that.

6502
02:55:54,030 --> 02:55:54,863
Might look at it though.

6503
02:55:55,790 --> 02:55:56,240
No,

6504
02:55:56,240 --> 02:55:58,180
am I not that girls would call clean.

6505
02:55:58,260 --> 02:56:02,390
Roughly half of the thing
about sex is animalistic man.

6506
02:56:02,540 --> 02:56:03,261
The dirtiness,

6507
02:56:03,261 --> 02:56:04,130
the humiliation.

6508
02:56:04,440 --> 02:56:05,273
Now

6509
02:56:12,050 --> 02:56:13,850
what are we going to wrap this up?

6510
02:56:14,050 --> 02:56:14,883
I'm just,

6511
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:15,833
he sweating

6512
02:56:17,150 --> 02:56:17,990
so fucked up.

6513
02:56:18,440 --> 02:56:19,610
You shouldn't be talking on the air.

6514
02:56:21,020 --> 02:56:21,471
That's it.

6515
02:56:21,471 --> 02:56:23,050
Nothing bad has been said.

6516
02:56:23,590 --> 02:56:24,423
Beautiful.

6517
02:56:24,450 --> 02:56:27,680
Talking about aerial
is I love dark points.

6518
02:56:27,990 --> 02:56:28,260
No,

6519
02:56:28,260 --> 02:56:28,411
no,

6520
02:56:28,411 --> 02:56:28,581
no.

6521
02:56:28,581 --> 02:56:29,550
I like uh,

6522
02:56:29,590 --> 02:56:31,640
I like my wife is like a high pink.

6523
02:56:32,150 --> 02:56:32,983
I like that.

6524
02:56:33,610 --> 02:56:34,443
It just seems,

6525
02:56:34,610 --> 02:56:35,570
it seems real.

6526
02:56:36,170 --> 02:56:36,801
I wasn't real.

6527
02:56:36,801 --> 02:56:39,650
I don't want to go into the Strip club
and have them be able to get naked like

6528
02:56:39,740 --> 02:56:40,280
that.

6529
02:56:40,280 --> 02:56:42,380
I want them to like
take nervous about off.

6530
02:56:42,790 --> 02:56:43,840
Oh what the real miss.

6531
02:56:43,850 --> 02:56:46,070
I want to see like the
sock marks in their leg.

6532
02:56:46,071 --> 02:56:46,760
Realness.

6533
02:56:46,760 --> 02:56:47,020
Oh,

6534
02:56:47,020 --> 02:56:47,570
sophomores.

6535
02:56:47,570 --> 02:56:48,590
Like I want real,

6536
02:56:48,650 --> 02:56:51,740
let's wrap this bitch up cause
this is going to go south.

6537
02:56:52,310 --> 02:56:53,260
Sock mark.

6538
02:56:53,310 --> 02:56:54,980
So I just got back from Columbus,

6539
02:56:54,981 --> 02:56:57,290
Ohio and you're not
allowed to be naked there.

6540
02:56:57,320 --> 02:56:59,030
And so all the girls had pastries,

6541
02:56:59,120 --> 02:57:01,880
but they would have like
darker nipple looking pasty.

6542
02:57:01,881 --> 02:57:04,290
So it looked like they all
just had really big area,

6543
02:57:04,291 --> 02:57:06,380
all that dark Ariel and
now it's ridiculous.

6544
02:57:06,381 --> 02:57:11,030
You have to have a thin rubber sheet over
the outside of your nipple and if you

6545
02:57:11,031 --> 02:57:13,850
go outside you could just take her
shirt off cause it's legal in Columbus,

6546
02:57:13,851 --> 02:57:15,770
Ohio to just take your shirt off outside.

6547
02:57:15,770 --> 02:57:17,480
But when you're inside at the Strip club,

6548
02:57:17,481 --> 02:57:18,200
you have to put page.

6549
02:57:18,200 --> 02:57:19,190
These are in Columbus.

6550
02:57:19,191 --> 02:57:20,880
It's legal to be topless
if you're a woman,

6551
02:57:20,930 --> 02:57:22,590
been there for forever.

6552
02:57:22,600 --> 02:57:22,940
It's,

6553
02:57:22,940 --> 02:57:24,170
you can just walk around with nuts.

6554
02:57:24,220 --> 02:57:25,130
It's hilarious.

6555
02:57:25,131 --> 02:57:26,150
What a dumb business.

6556
02:57:26,151 --> 02:57:26,720
Hey,

6557
02:57:26,720 --> 02:57:27,920
are you upset at all?

6558
02:57:27,921 --> 02:57:31,610
The freedom that you have with girl's
nipples out there on the street will come

6559
02:57:31,611 --> 02:57:32,450
on inside.

6560
02:57:33,590 --> 02:57:34,190
Come on and shout.

6561
02:57:34,190 --> 02:57:37,640
We'll show you a watered down version
of what's available right outside our

6562
02:57:37,641 --> 02:57:38,474
door.

6563
02:57:39,260 --> 02:57:41,090
Christy tickets a nipple warrior.

6564
02:57:41,530 --> 02:57:42,200
Who's that?

6565
02:57:42,200 --> 02:57:42,561
I don't know.

6566
02:57:42,561 --> 02:57:43,400
I just read it the other way.

6567
02:57:43,401 --> 02:57:44,260
She's a nipple warrior.

6568
02:57:44,590 --> 02:57:45,480
What does that mean?

6569
02:57:45,640 --> 02:57:46,473
I don't even know.

6570
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:50,320
Fuck Debbie Morris kids.

6571
02:57:50,321 --> 02:57:51,154
That nipple warrior,

6572
02:57:51,560 --> 02:57:52,430
the Nipple Warriors.

6573
02:57:52,520 --> 02:57:53,620
Does that mean they liked?

6574
02:57:53,621 --> 02:57:55,370
They want everyone to be
able to see their nipples.

6575
02:57:55,400 --> 02:57:55,761
Oh,

6576
02:57:55,761 --> 02:57:56,330
okay.

6577
02:57:56,330 --> 02:57:56,661
Okay.

6578
02:57:56,661 --> 02:57:59,000
Like I'll really sheer shirt
or something like that.

6579
02:57:59,020 --> 02:57:59,121
No,

6580
02:57:59,121 --> 02:57:59,270
no,

6581
02:57:59,270 --> 02:57:59,441
no,

6582
02:57:59,441 --> 02:57:59,570
no,

6583
02:57:59,570 --> 02:57:59,751
no,

6584
02:57:59,751 --> 02:58:00,200
no.

6585
02:58:00,200 --> 02:58:01,780
They want to go if you,

6586
02:58:01,781 --> 02:58:02,020
if we

6587
02:58:02,020 --> 02:58:04,290
just start typing Demi Moore's kid.

6588
02:58:04,890 --> 02:58:06,500
She just walks around shirtless.

6589
02:58:07,930 --> 02:58:08,910
A Barb,

6590
02:58:08,911 --> 02:58:10,200
you gotta be like 20 or something.

6591
02:58:10,260 --> 02:58:11,490
You're talking about Jay Leno.

6592
02:58:11,590 --> 02:58:12,060

02:58:14,790 --> 02:58:15,361
One of the names,

6596
02:58:15,361 --> 02:58:16,110
right or something.

6597
02:58:16,110 --> 02:58:17,250
Wait rain or something.

6598
02:58:17,370 --> 02:58:18,203
Wrinkles.

6599
02:58:18,390 --> 02:58:18,940
Wrinkles.

6600
02:58:18,940 --> 02:58:21,000

You're going more and more demi

02:58:28,400 --> 02:58:30,300
Like five minutes now her name is rumor.

6606
02:58:30,390 --> 02:58:30,691

6607

Don't Jay Leno.

6611
02:58:34,590 --> 02:58:35,370
He's a little kid alone.

6612
02:58:35,370 --> 02:58:35,551
No,

6613
