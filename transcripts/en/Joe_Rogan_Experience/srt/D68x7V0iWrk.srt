1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
We do,
um,

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,370
a couple of commercials and then we get 
cracking because the commercials were on

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:07,350
right now.
So when the commercials start,

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,600
if you feel like talking,
you just go ahead.

5
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:10,710
It doesn't mean it.
No,

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:13,030
I'll do it.
I'll be respectful to you.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,960
Doesn't matter.
Commercials.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,360
Jim Jeffries.
I'm telling you.

9
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:17,630
You do whatever you want to do.
Everyone's allowed to chime in.

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,370
Fart on me.
Who is Tim Jeffries?

11
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:21,870
Just waved a fart on me.
I did.

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,330
I don't even know what I do these days.
I did that so solidly.

13
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,440
That sounds like something I would have 
done.

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,010
So I'm going to.
I'm going to just apologize and you 

15
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,010
don't even.
You just went on autopilot.

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,590
Auto Fart on you.
Pilot the podcast brought to you by the 

17
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,050
flashlight.
That's our main number one sponsor.

18
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:44,070
Our first sponsor ever of all time.
Way Back in the day when we were just on

19
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:46,440
a laptop with Ustream snowflakes in the 
background.

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,160
When they were black and white,
there was a flashlight.

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,980
That's when the date before the Avatar 
or that not alien movie one.

22
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,130
They were just black and white.
We started when there was black and 

23
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:58,950
white television stuff,
but fleshlight stopped blind prion.

24
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,070
It's true.
There was no black and white 

25
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,070
televisions.
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,320
Like,
like back in the day there was black and

27
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:09,321
white TV and when we started with just 
like we started winning was only black 

28
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,020
and white,
you know,

29
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:12,360
black and white flashlights.
That's a terrible joke.

30
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,210
It wasn't.
It doesn't even make sense.

31
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,160
It doesn't even make me go back even 
further and go.

32
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:21,480
We started the podcast with talkies.
It doesn't even make sense.

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,880
That's what it was silent.
That's when we were doing.

34
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:26,460
You're lying to these people.
They know you only been doing it for two

35
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,080
years.
Everybody knows.

36
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,400
No,
no,

37
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,450
no.
The flashlight like black and white.

38
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,540
It's just a flashlight joke.
It was not supposed to be really thought

39
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,100
about too.
Was it true?

40
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,320
There was more.
There was a bunch of different colors,

41
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,070
right?
No,

42
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,130
when we started,
I think it was just black and white 

43
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:43,320
unless they had the alien one before 
that,

44
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:46,070
but I don't think they did.
Didn't they have like zombies and shit?

45
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,780
No.
That happened on late recently.

46
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,490
Really?
Yeah,

47
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,150
so you have as a black and white,
so that's what your joke was.

48
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,810
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

49
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,260
It was pretty good man.
Did you like it?

50
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,560
No,
I have.

51
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,560
I haven't even got it yet.

52
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,160
Somebody else is here.
I'm glad because you know if there's a 

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,650
message boards out there,
there's 100 people right now.

54
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:09,570
The agreement.
Brian,

55
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,620
Brian's totally.
It totally made sense.

56
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,990
It was an excellent joke.
Fucking duking it out right now and some

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,690
internet forums over this.
Anyway,

58
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,180
it's a good product.
The fleshlight solid,

59
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,940
you know it's embarrassing shore,
but you know you're going to masturbate,

60
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:25,290
so just go get one.
Fuck it.

61
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,190
Try it.
It's good.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,210
Use codenamed Rogan and you save 15 
percent.

63
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,330
There you go.
To save you some money and joy,

64
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,420
it will also brought to you by 
[inaudible] Dot Com,

65
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,880
o n n I t,
makers of Alpha brain,

66
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:42,030
the cognitive enhancing supplements,
new mood,

67
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,820
the serotonin boosting supplement,
and we have shroom,

68
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,860
tech,
sport and shroom,

69
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:46,380
tech,
immune,

70
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:48,400
all of them essentially.
Um,

71
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,540
except for I guess the shroom tech 
wouldn't be necessarily thought of as a 

72
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,521
nootropic,
but what they are with especially a 

73
00:02:58,521 --> 00:02:58,521
Alpha brain is,
is,

74
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:00,280
uh,
it's vitamins

75
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,180
for enhancing your cognitive function.
What does that mean?

76
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,390
The way it's explained to me is it 
enhances your body's ability to produce 

77
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,260
neurotransmitters and you feel,
feel better.

78
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:13,300
You feel clear.
I take it all the time.

79
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,000
I feel great and I noticed a difference 
to you when I'm taking it.

80
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,230
And when I'm not taking it,
I,

81
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,790
I can tell 'em,
go to [inaudible] dot com for details.

82
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,830
Oh,
and it.

83
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,220
And uh,
use a code name,

84
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:27,880
Rogan and save 10 percent first 30 
pills.

85
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,380
The first order you may get,
if anything,

86
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,550
it's a 100 percent money back guarantee.
So even if you eat it all,

87
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:35,800
you could take all the vitamins,
eat all 30 of them and go,

88
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:37,120
you know,
and I think this is shit.

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,480
Then you get your money back.
No one's trying to rip anybody off.

90
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:45,481
This is all stuff that I've used long 
before I was ever associated with this 

91
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:46,540
company and I'm a big believer in 
vitamins.

92
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,180
So

93
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,380
go and check it out.
I'm playing footsies with his bitch 

94
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,210
playing footsies with.
We needed more space.

95
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,160
Is What this is.
Is tables too small?

96
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,380
Accidental footsies will not be 
tolerated.

97
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,860
Especially I'm barefoot.
I'm like one of the Abbott brothers 

98
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,730
brothers in a music video.
I'm going to take off my shoe and sock 

99
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,300
will be really gross.
Don't take off your shoes and socks.

100
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,800
Sometimes you fried steak dude.
You know every now and then you rock the

101
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:16,150
wrong shoes too many days in a row.
I slept with my shoes.

102
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't last night.
So you might be right.

103
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,240
I heard you slept in your car,
is that correct?

104
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,430
Yeah,
I passed out in my car for a little 

105
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:26,430
while.
You driving then passed out.

106
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,080
We just remember.
I just walked.

107
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,670
By the way.
That's so illegal.

108
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,260
You should never do that.
You should just get a hotel somewhere 

109
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,460
because if you're asleep in your car and
you,

110
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:40,461
even if you have no intention of driving
drunk and have a cop knocks on your 

111
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:40,461
door,
you're going to jail.

112
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:41,610
But what if you're in the backseat 
garnered gel?

113
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,490
Really kind of sleeping a canton?
No,

114
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,130
no,
no.

115
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,240
What about all these comics that always 
tell you that?

116
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:48,200
Like I was sleeping in my car the first 
year,

117
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,210
they got lucky.
They were all doing something illegal.

118
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,660
Well,
no,

119
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,070
they're not

120
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,220
necessarily doing something illegal.
I mean,

121
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:58,221
you know,
I bet there's places you could park 

122
00:04:58,221 --> 00:04:58,221
where no one's going to care.
We can go to rest.

123
00:04:58,221 --> 00:05:02,210
Stop.
Thiswhat restaurant scene is if you're 

124
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:02,210
drunk,
if you're drunk and you're in your car,

125
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,051
if you're sleeping in your car,
they don't care that you had no 

126
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:06,420
intention to drive drunk.
They still,

127
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:07,200
they're,
they're gonna.

128
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,030
They're gonna fucking arrest.
Yo.

129
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,470
If you're hammered or you're in your 
car.

130
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,080
I,
I don't drink drive because I'm not a 

131
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,080
citizen the day I am.
Yeah,

132
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,500
we haven't even started yet.
Go to [inaudible] dot com.

133
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:20,850
Learn everything,
details,

134
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:21,600
blah,
blah blah.

135
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,750
And in the code named Rogan,
save yourself 10 percent off or all 

136
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,900
orders done.
Thank you very much.

137
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,130
Ladies and gentlemen,

138
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,840
the Great Jim,
Jefferies,

139
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,190
the ladies and gentlemen.
Um,

140
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,960
and this podcast unfortunately started 
about 15 minutes ago and we just decided

141
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:52,600
to let you in on it now for the past 15 
minutes.

142
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,320
Jim Jefferies and Brian have been 
laughing up a storm.

143
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,100
You,

144
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,110
you silly bitches.
I feel like we've used all the best 

145
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,110
stuff to be.
Yeah.

146
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,600
I feel like we,
we,

147
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,000
you know,
we got to a good.

148
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,960
It's like if you go to the gym and you 
lift,

149
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,130
first thing you do is too heavy.
You can fuck up the rest of your 

150
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:12,130
workout.
Right?

151
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:12,260
Brian?
Yeah.

152
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,840
Brian knows what's up.
Jim Jefferies,

153
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,910
I personal train.
Very occasionally I get personally 

154
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,740
trained by a guy who gets very 
disappointed in me.

155
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,820
Kenny Kane.
Oh yeah.

156
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,130
It was a comedian as well.
Oh,

157
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:27,190
he's a comedian slash personal fitness 
guys.

158
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,250
Oh,
that's cool.

159
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,000
How do you become a personal fitness 
guide?

160
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,480
You have to have as a degree in 
kinesiology.

161
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,480
Dying.
No,

162
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,650
he trains lots of famous people,
so he must have something going on.

163
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:40,640
You just,
I guess I for me to be convinced,

164
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:44,060
but personal training is just,
it's just,

165
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:44,300
it.

166
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,030
It's only useful to lazy people.
You know what I mean,

167
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,400
because I give up really quickly.
It's just the guy.

168
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,700
I just need a person.
It could be a fat person staying there 

169
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:54,700
going,
keep going,

170
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,280
come on,
come on.

171
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,450
You've got another one.
And you're like,

172
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,440
all right then.
Because if I'm by myself,

173
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,670
a very low threshold for any type of 
activity really.

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,720
But you make yourself go to the gym,
like I don't want to be.

175
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:07,820
I don't want to be morbidly obese.
No.

176
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:10,730
My mother's a huge fat woman.
I have fat jeans.

177
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:14,870
I fight against that.
I don't want to be a fatty.

178
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,590
Yeah.
Will You keep it together?

179
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,670
You know,
I'm always on the brink,

180
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,720
but uh,
yeah,

181
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,570
it's tough to be disciplined,
you know?

182
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,960
It's tough to force yourself to do shit 
that's not pleasant,

183
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,700
but you're very good at,
but you enjoy it.

184
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,960
Right?
I feel like

185
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,500
I need it.
I don't,

186
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,750
I don't like the way I function when I 
don't work out.

187
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,300
I don't like the way I think.
I don't like the,

188
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:36,770
you know,
my,

189
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,190
my threshold threshold for getting 
annoyed at things gets too high.

190
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,350
You know,
I'm two tents,

191
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,860
I think physically the way you 
physically feel it affects the way you 

192
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,200
interacted with people and I think you 
almost have a duty,

193
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,530
you know,
to try to keep your shit in line at 

194
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,050
least enough so that it's not fucking up
on you,

195
00:07:58,051 --> 00:08:00,990
so you're annoyed all the time when 
you're around people because that's what

196
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,590
a lot of like really cranky,
bitchy people.

197
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
You know what that is?
That's,

198
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,510
that's a person with a really unhappy 
body that's an unhappy

199
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,880
I'm of the opinion that if you let 
yourself go too much,

200
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:17,881
you do become a burden on others.
It's all right if you get my kids get 

201
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:21,110
cancer or something like that.
I think in the more fat it's more 

202
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,941
comfortable,
but there's some dudes where you see a 

203
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:24,160
model in and

204
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,880
come on man,
you know someone's got to pull you aside

205
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:29,860
like you got this has got to stop.

206
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,970
How do you and not have anybody that 
couldn't have talked some sense into you

207
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:34,920
it.
Well,

208
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,090
I guess the pool is just too strong,
man.

209
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,740
Now my mother is a huge woman.
How big a at a peak would have been over

210
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:46,710
300 pounds,
but also also bring in hoarding.

211
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,200
Oh No.
Is a condition.

212
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,480
That TV show I changed my fucking life,
man.

213
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:55,030
That's my childhood.
I was watching it like,

214
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,760
yeah,
borderline.

215
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,410
Oh my God.
But every single one of our bedrooms,

216
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:00,390
after we moved out,
me and my two brothers,

217
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,300
those bedrooms that would just fill up 
with shit just.

218
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,590
But Jesus Christ.
Now,

219
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,670
when,
when you,

220
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,990
when you look back,
did you,

221
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,850
what did you think was going on when you
were a kid?

222
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,470
Um,
I just,

223
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,500
my mother called herself a collector.
You know how these people call 

224
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,140
themselves collectors if they toward one
particular thing,

225
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,030
but it was,
it was porcelain dolls.

226
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,750
Creepy Victorian fucking dolls are all 
around your hundreds and hundreds of 

227
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:30,380
them just staring at you while you ever 
do mushrooms and look at them.

228
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,180
Terrifying.
Oh my.

229
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,620
That would not be split.
There was one that used to scare me that

230
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:39,260
I'd had to put a towel over his head 
every time I was watching TV.

231
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:40,530
Otherwise I couldn't.
Wow.

232
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,510
Be Comfortable with my grandmother.
Was it,

233
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:48,511
was that in those little paper weights 
that were light look like Globes or 

234
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:48,511
something?
Oh yeah,

235
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,920
everywhere.
When you look them in and some of those,

236
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,260
but also those big marble ones that it 
looks like you've just had a huge 

237
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,961
marble.
I've never understood the pipe white 

238
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:04,151
market I've probably had in my life my 
ab 10 pipe away.

239
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,890
I don't think I've had,
I've never had a bit where I like,

240
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,070
my paper has been so out of control.
I just shut windows.

241
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,140
You know what I mean?
Like I'm a window shutter.

242
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:20,141
I,
I see that as an easier fix than just 

243
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,360
paper blowing everywhere or.
And plus there's so many outside,

244
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:26,361
like in your yard,
if you really needed something to wait 

245
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:29,100
one polk one,
and if anything's one,

246
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,500
these people who,
who made just think that it's an actual 

247
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,851
invention that will like,
we'll build an actual blast object with 

248
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:38,780
a spindly thing in the middle.
Yeah.

249
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,030
And then everybody else was like,
Oh shit,

250
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:43,290
we got to get involved with that market.
Right?

251
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,140
God Damn.
I got to jump on that.

252
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,840
Global wonder.
I wonder if it's patented or patent.

253
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,910
Usually patented,
that's what we painted.

254
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,980
Is that how you would say it?

255
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,920
That's how I would say it,
but I still think that's the wrong way 

256
00:10:59,920 --> 00:10:59,920
to say it.
In my exit,

257
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,520
it was me speaking like a todd.
I don't think it was.

258
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,020
I don't think it was anything to do with
being Australian.

259
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,220
It's so bizarre

260
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,250
how similar Australians are two 
Americans,

261
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,110
even though like,
you know,

262
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:14,060
you guys have a different accent,
you know,

263
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:17,030
the accents a little,
a little odd for us.

264
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,450
I think we're seeing more similar to the
British person you are as well.

265
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,880
But I mean it's,
it's amazing how you go there,

266
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,800
what I'm going by the way,
uh,

267
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,880
the way.
I mean and it's like you just could fit 

268
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,141
right in the,
the accent notes after a day and that's 

269
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:33,200
just what people sound like.
And it seems like you're in America.

270
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,610
Well,
I don't notice the American accent now 

271
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,561
on anybody at all.
It's the only one I have to do an 

272
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:43,141
audition and they make me do the 
American accent that I'd get a bit 

273
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:43,141
shitty with the whole thing.
Oh,

274
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:47,821
do they do that?
That you would make you change your 

275
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:47,821
voice for that.
And like,

276
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:51,090
I fucked that one audition.
I got a couple of callbacks and then I 

277
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,090
said the word,
uh,

278
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,600
I said,
I said I went to the zoo and I saw her 

279
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:55,600
zebra.
I still said,

280
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Whoa,
Whoa,

281
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,620
whoa.
He just said that.

282
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,650
I still said it in an American accent,
but with British phrasing and they 

283
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,921
freaked the fuck out.
I need to hear more of this American 

284
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:04,921
voice.
That was a creepy voice.

285
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:04,921
Dude.
Why?

286
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:08,821
Why is that so creepy?
What are we going to do that is creepy 

287
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:11,560
as fuck you talking with an American 
voice.

288
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,890
That is crazy.
Like I say,

289
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,300
I'm sort of anonymous advice.
I can't a lot on stage.

290
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,180
People always want me to say like when I
photos and it talking American right now

291
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,740
in my accent,
if I say it's,

292
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,860
it sounds great,
but even when I say count as an 

293
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:28,860
American,
I've go,

294
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,120
oh,
well that's a bit harsh dude.

295
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:36,121
You sound like a totally different human
when you look at that fucking kid over 

296
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:36,580
there.
Come on.

297
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,790
Never think that's Jim Jefferies.
There's no way.

298
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,910
I would think that's,
you know,

299
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,750
that's the thing is called me up.
That would freak me the fuck out.

300
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:45,190
I'm tell you right now.
Don't do that.

301
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,500
Just sound guy.
You know,

302
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,550
it doesn't sound.
I just want to speak to you very 

303
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:53,550
quickly.
We have a few problems here right now.

304
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,980
It sounds vaguely fucked up.
Like you.

305
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,080
It doesn't sound right.

306
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,260
It sounds really good though.
It's so close to like a real person.

307
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,190
Like there's something affected about 
Saint Joe.

308
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,820
I want to hear you.
And then that kind of like a fight.

309
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,780
It wasn't bad.
That was,

310
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,990
shall we say we don't,
we don't,

311
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,120
we don't.
I do more English like mine.

312
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,130
Mine's 50 slash 50 because I lived in 
England for 10 years,

313
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:30,100
but we don't say the word.
We don't say the word shrimp.

314
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,850
Like Americans go pro and stripped.
We call them prawns,

315
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,910
right?
Paul Hogan does that fucking commercial 

316
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:38,910
where he goes,
oh,

317
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,520
I'll throw another shrimp on the Barbie 
for you like that.

318
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:44,521
Right.
And now that's synonymous with a 

319
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:44,521
strange.
When that's not even a word,

320
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:46,270
we say I'm probably yelled at out at 
American gigs,

321
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,940
but when I'm on stage going through the 
shrimp thing,

322
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:50,240
I'm like,
what the fuck off man?

323
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Isn't it weird how many like crazy 
personalities have come out of 

324
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Australia?

325
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,600
Like the crocodile hunter about Hogan 
Crocodile Dundee.

326
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,190
Diana?
Yeah,

327
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,260
and he lives around here somewhere.
Does it?

328
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Kangaroo Jack.
They only did a couple of those 

329
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,080
crocodile dundee.
So then they were done.

330
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,160
I would have thought that could have 
been like some Indiana Jones type.

331
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:15,610
None.
None.

332
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:18,940
I did the third.
The third one is appalling.

333
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,440
Third One's always straight to DVD.
Yeah,

334
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,010
and it's.
And it's like.

335
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:29,140
Because the whole idea was a crocodile.
Dundee went from Australia in the 

336
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,520
outback of Australia to New York and 
it's like,

337
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:35,521
what the fuck's he going to do?
This is such a different place so you 

338
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:35,521
can survive out there,
but he can't survive here.

339
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:37,480
It's not for the first two films.
Then for the third film,

340
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:41,140
you think let's send him to another 
country like Britain or somewhere else.

341
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,830
That's different.
It's Crocodile Dundee in La.

342
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,090
Now.
The thing is,

343
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,270
he's been living since the last 
crocodile dundee film.

344
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:54,271
He's been living in New York for over a 
decade and then he gets to la and he 

345
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:57,350
doesn't know what's going on when it 
gets too alarming for him.

346
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,840
Like where all these people wearing 
sunglasses full.

347
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:01,460
This is weed.
She's.

348
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:06,461
These women's breasts are too big,
like it's not a great film and in the 

349
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:11,231
end he becomes an animal trainer for the
movies and he foils a robbery and 

350
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,030
actually now I look back.
It's a great field.

351
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,860
I didn't give it uninhibited chairs.
She was just the sheer ridiculousness.

352
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,110
Still with Lynda Kozlowski who he 
married from the.

353
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,770
From the movie.
The thing is a Paul Hogan was married to

354
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:35,180
a real fat woman called Napoleon Hogan 
who was just this big fat woman.

355
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:40,390
Right.
And he had five kids with her and then 

356
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:40,390
he does the CROC,
which he had before.

357
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,571
He was famous.
Then he did Crocodile Dundee and he 

358
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:44,630
started dating Lynda Kozlowski and the 
Australian public.

359
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:45,290
We're like,
oh,

360
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:50,291
what's he done to his wife?
But now he's been with that bird for 25 

361
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,021
years.
So you can't really get into him as 

362
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:53,021
much.
I start dating and a bird.

363
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:55,720
No.
You know British justice,

364
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,930
you know Brian,
you know,

365
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,720
silly goose,
a Beatles song.

366
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,530
Blackbird is about Rosa parks.
Wow.

367
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,690
Because Paul Mccartney was going good 
with that black bird,

368
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:06,930
did they?
It was pretty cool.

369
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,840
Wow.
Wow.

370
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,120
So for birds,
like a person or a girl?

371
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,970
I go just to go and a girl?
Yeah.

372
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:17,630
Like normally if you say this is my bird
or those birds look nice.

373
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:19,820
You wouldn't normally about an 
attractive woman.

374
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,230
Big called a bird?
Yeah.

375
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,040
Would you ever fuck a real bird?
It's like an eagle.

376
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,110
I feel bad about it.
I'll answer the question.

377
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,800
I was going to fuck a Birdie.
Have you had to flick burden?

378
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,680
It would be.
It would be something with long legs.

379
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,580
I didn't have to squat or anything like 
that.

380
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,750
The peacock or then you could just hold 
the burden.

381
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Fuck it.
But I'm thinking like an amiable or an 

382
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,221
ostrich or Flamingo Flamingo pink.
And then I'd be pretty comfortable with 

383
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:48,900
that.
Flamingo

384
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,310
mango smell like shit.
When you walk past the Flamingo thing,

385
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,080
you would totally lose your bone or they
can balance on one leg,

386
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,500
neck to choke,
but they live in the,

387
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:01,910
uh,
at the La Zoo.

388
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,970
It's like a shit pool.
Just a pool of bird shit on generally 

389
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:12,670
have a zoo in San Diego and La didn't 
really the difference between a bird 

390
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:14,750
burden.
A mammals.

391
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,900
I would feel bad if I fucked a mammal,
like if I fucked a dog and be like,

392
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,010
oh,
sorry dude,

393
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,990
I'd feel bad because I like animals.
But a dog's got a memo,

394
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,880
isn't sure.
Of course.

395
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,180
I thought we were mammals.
Mammals,

396
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,000
a warm blooded furry creature.
I get mixed up.

397
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,450
All right.
So while I was on fish right there 

398
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:37,450
actually,
but I still like,

399
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:37,460
I don't give a shit.
It's a fish.

400
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,170
Whales are actually mammals.
Haley blow.

401
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,780
Whoa,
Whoa,

402
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:42,960
Whoa,
Whoa,

403
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:43,270
whoa.

404
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,270
They'd be there too.
But you also have a bottle.

405
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,750
Funny that nothing that breeze water is 
smart and that kind of cool water.

406
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,660
Stupid.
Except for like octopus geniuses.

407
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,810
They reckon.
Yeah.

408
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,280
Yeah.
They think they're kind of smart,

409
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,610
which is why when you eat like a baby 
octopus salad or something,

410
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,890
that's why people don't want eight 
dolphins because they're geniuses,

411
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:09,891
but now eating new fetus size,
that's pretty dangerous place to go 

412
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,740
with.
Well,

413
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,110
it's pretty dangerous to lock up 
dolphins and killer whales.

414
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:21,111
That's even more dangerous because 
that's something that we know that 

415
00:18:21,111 --> 00:18:21,180
talking to each other,
we know they have a complex language.

416
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:26,181
We don't give a fuck or whatever.
It's such a confined space for the 

417
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:28,920
terrible.
Not only that,

418
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,840
there's a thrill and killing things.
There's look,

419
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,210
people get a charge out of being a 
hunter gatherer,

420
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,510
like people that go hunting.

421
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,510
When you go fishing and catch a fish,
there's like a primal like release that 

422
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,560
you get from that and that's like it's.
It's natural.

423
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:45,960
It's like a part of like the reward 
system.

424
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:48,150
The nature's put in place to make sure 
you carry on,

425
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,720
so they have all these raging,
raging hormones inside of them and all 

426
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,530
these killer instincts to take things 
out.

427
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,450
They're supposed to be killing shit left
and right.

428
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:02,540
This is fucking killer.
Whales that these gigantic monster is 

429
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,460
animals and they don't know shit.
Dolphins on into killing.

430
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,560
Just little fish dolphins killed 
themselves.

431
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,120
They.
They killed little dolphins.

432
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:12,360
They kill baby dolphins.
The dolphins murder each other.

433
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,620
It's fun to grab onto the thin though.
I like the touch,

434
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,980
romanticize it,
but the,

435
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:20,910
the world underwater.
It's cool as fuck.

436
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:26,210
You know,
killer whales eat dolphins and dolphins 

437
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,820
regularly.
Babies to kill baby dolphins thing,

438
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,650
but know that they would help baby 
humans,

439
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:32,280
which is funny.

440
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,950
They.
So what a killer whale.

441
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,830
He just murdered babies all the time and
the only,

442
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,490
the only wells that have been 
documented,

443
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:43,530
there's been rumors about people now.
The only way as Wales that have been 

444
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,870
documented as killing people,
the ones that are in captivity,

445
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,160
they actually help people never killing 
the wild.

446
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:51,510
Yeah,
but that's the same thing.

447
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:52,140
Sting,
right?

448
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,010
How many sting rays at paypal before 
fucking Steve Owen came involved.

449
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,540
Some.
I'm sure it's like four or five direct 

450
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,530
write something real low number.
You just can't fuck with something like 

451
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:04,530
that.
But the thing is,

452
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:04,970
that's why they go,
oh,

453
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,980
we'll never released the footage out of 
respect because they know he wasn't 

454
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,830
patting it going,
isn't this a lovely thing?

455
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,030
Look at this.
You know,

456
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,330
he was grabbing the title guy,
we're gonna kill Ya.

457
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:18,660
And he pointing it up to God.
Could you imagine if you did,

458
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:23,690
if that's really what was going on,
do you think that they would own the 

459
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:23,690
American public or the public?

460
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,950
The worldwide public rather,
they would owe them that just for.

461
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,540
Just to.
To know that,

462
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,540
to say don't ever do this,
don't do this.

463
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,320
These little.
It was,

464
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:36,430
it wasn't even his show.
It was for his daughters show for like 

465
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,531
the Disney channel or whatever.
And his daughter was on the boat and 

466
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,400
then just go.
I reckon he would have lived it.

467
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:42,630
I didn't pull it out.
It would have flunked everything in it.

468
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:44,100
They left it in.
They would have lived in town,

469
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,930
but he pulled it out.
Oh Jesus.

470
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:48,700
Fucking Christ.
I went swimming with,

471
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,640
with sting rays about a month later,
like hundreds and hundreds of them.

472
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,720
Dan In antigo let fucking idiots like me
in the water,

473
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,130
so they're obviously pretty plastic 
dental.

474
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,430
I don't know if they're all the same 
species.

475
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,070
I think there's a bunch of different 
kinds of sting rays to.

476
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,080
I don't think know what he was fucking 
with.

477
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Yeah,
well the thing is some of them are only 

478
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,140
like very few of them are poisonous 
stingers,

479
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,200
but he didn't.
It wasn't that.

480
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,610
It was pointed as it went through his 
hot,

481
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,110
you know,
everybody it was.

482
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,140
He's a weird,
weird guy because like everybody really 

483
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,140
loved that guy.
Apparently.

484
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,580
It was a super nice guy.
Everybody loved him.

485
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,610
He put all these money back into 
conservation and stuff.

486
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Like he was very charitable man so.
But there were people that looked at 

487
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,781
some of the shit he did and we're 
laureus like when he was holding his 

488
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:36,400
child while feeding a crocodile,
that was good.

489
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,520
That was the most ridiculous shit I 
think I've ever seen a person and they 

490
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,190
had a little baby running away.
I kind liked that though.

491
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,410
I didn't like that at all.
That's ridiculously cocky.

492
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,870
Just because that thing is never jacked 
you before,

493
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,460
doesn't mean it can't right now.

494
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,830
If it's just decides it needs more than 
that chicken.

495
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Are you really confident in what it's 
fucking die been for the last couple of 

496
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,560
weeks?
The baby is the size of a big chicken.

497
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,130
They would be happy to eat you.
There was a bunch of kayakers that we're

498
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,190
going through some fucking river and uh,
one of them got taken out by a 

499
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,931
crocodile.
So real recent things and like was it a 

500
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:12,931
New York Times article or something like
that.

501
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,590
But from the perspective of the other 
two guys that were kayaking in a fucking

502
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:22,591
crocodile came and checked them.
You imagine you're in the position that 

503
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:24,600
you would,
what,

504
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,720
what it would feel like to be on a kayak
and just get taken out by a giant 

505
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,661
dinosaur.
Just something that was alive $100 

506
00:22:33,661 --> 00:22:36,971
million years ago.
It looked exactly the same because I 

507
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:37,180
reckon the big difference between 
crocodiles and alligators,

508
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:42,670
crocodiles search for food and 
alligators sit and white really know 

509
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:42,670
now.

510
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,410
I gotta do is sit in a swamp in Miami 
and just until,

511
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,910
until something stupidly looked like a 
rock until something extreme is by where

512
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:50,440
a crocodile just wakes up in the 
morning,

513
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:55,441
Guy,
I'm going to fucking catch something so 

514
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:55,441
you can't fuck with them as much.
White label line,

515
00:22:55,441 --> 00:23:00,360
they're very aggressive.
There was a park in Florida where they 

516
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,040
raise crocodiles and alligators together
and when they're designing,

517
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:07,810
the crocodiles left when you can,
when the crop,

518
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,260
when they were feeding them,
the crocodiles running over the heads of

519
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:13,400
the alligators to get the food.
It was,

520
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,500
it was ridiculous.
You just looked at it,

521
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,350
you went,
whatever that thing is,

522
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,020
fuck that thing.
The alligator is uh,

523
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:23,640
the fags of the crocodile.
Clearly.

524
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,770
Yeah.
I lived in Florida.

525
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:29,200
I was around alligators all the time 
when I was a kid.

526
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,580
I lived there for a couple of years,
is as long as it,

527
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:34,060
it bothered me,
Lake Alice,

528
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,070
but they would snatch dogs every now and
then.

529
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:41,071
Some of them would fuck up and walk 
their dog too close to the shore and 

530
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,010
they would snatch it.
And it's scary shit.

531
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,040
When you hear about some little old lady
and her fucking dog gets

532
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,610
yanked away from her man,
imagined what that is for her,

533
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:51,670
her little buddy,
you know she's walking in the hills.

534
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:53,990
You probably get it around here as well 
with people are telling us not to have a

535
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:58,991
dog because fucking mountain lions will 
come and eat your dog just in the 

536
00:23:58,991 --> 00:23:59,390
Hollywood hills.
It can happen.

537
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:01,100
It's rare.
It can happen.

538
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,640
You know,
I'm more likely if you have a small 

539
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:06,640
dogs,
coyotes.

540
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,210
Coyotes are dangerous.
They'll snatch dogs for people too.

541
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,100
They've done that many times.
They're there.

542
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,410
They're tricky Fox and they also will 
gang up on people or on a.

543
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,430
well,
they haven't people.

544
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,190
A girl died last year in Toronto or 
outside of Toronto.

545
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,850
Some artist.
She was A.

546
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,690
I think it's trying to some somewhere in
Canada,

547
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,090
so I thought it was Toronto might not 
have been,

548
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:29,000
but it was somewhere in the woods.
She's going for a nature walk.

549
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,650
She was 19 years old,
is singer.

550
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,900
Apparently.
She's like a really good singer and a 

551
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:35,900
music contract.
She got jacked by a bunch of.

552
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,650
Was she good looking guy?
Killed by dogs,

553
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:41,060
basically big,
wild,

554
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:46,061
crazy dogs.
My girlfriend is gave me a look when I 

555
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:46,061
might check.
She didn't like that Jay.

556
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:50,560
Wow.
Because the implication was the ugly 

557
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:50,780
people should be allowed to die.
That's not pleasant.

558
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,860
No,
that's not.

559
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,060
I'm not saying they should die.
I'm just saying that if you're going to 

560
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,160
save one out of the to save the pretty 
one.

561
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,330
Yeah,
of course.

562
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,390
Of course.
You have to do that before you get on 

563
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:05,390
planes.
Before I got on a plane,

564
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,290
I sit there and I try to work out who I 
want to live and who I want to die.

565
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:08,670
When it crashes.
Right.

566
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:09,620
Like I said,
they're going,

567
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:14,630
whose company?
When one was comfortable with in this 

568
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,630
group.
As always,

569
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,771
the pretty ones they leave.
Sometimes it's just the person with a 

570
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:18,771
warm sort of look to them.
You know?

571
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:23,790
I always think of myself,
I wanted to just decide like some grand 

572
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:23,790
just like Hitler.
I just sit there.

573
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,010
They're going live,
live,

574
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:26,730
dead,
dead,

575
00:25:26,731 --> 00:25:27,240
dead,
dead,

576
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:28,080
dead,
alive.

577
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,320
I go wipe out whole families because I 
wasn't even mourning or crying.

578
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,420
Right?
So if one of your family goes,

579
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:38,510
your fucking go,
that means every time you want one of 

580
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,181
the hot daughters,
you have to get the whole family then 

581
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:41,181
right now then.
Yeah,

582
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:41,520
I suppose,
yeah,

583
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,850
keep on going on because she'll need 
comforting.

584
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,390
I'm always pitching me.
It's always going to be like on a snow 

585
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,161
crest inhale or something.
But I only really fly domestically 

586
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:52,161
across America.
It's not going to be that bad.

587
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:53,860
Did you see that Liam Neeson movie where
they're the.

588
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,590
I've heard it's great.
I haven't seen it,

589
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:57,210
but I had to chase him down the gray.

590
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,110
Yeah,
snow bad man.

591
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,220
It's unrealistic because the wolves 
don't really behave like that.

592
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,840
But uh,
it's uh,

593
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,860
it's pretty interesting when you,
you hear about people that actually have

594
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:13,861
been killed by wolves.
It's a lot more than I thought it was 

595
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:16,880
ready.
Made some chicken killed last year in 

596
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:16,880
Alaska by wolves and I thought,
wow,

597
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,911
that's probably really rare.
I bet that's only happened like once in 

598
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:20,911
100 years.
No,

599
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:21,610
no,
it happened a lot.

600
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,910
It used to happen a lot.
People used to get killed by wolves.

601
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It was like a total normal part of life.
There's all these documented cases of 

602
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,691
people killed by wolves.
That's why Peter and the wolf was such 

603
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:33,691
an entertaining program back then.
Yeah.

604
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:34,660
The,
the big bad wolf.

605
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,680
What is the big bad?
Well,

606
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:40,681
why is that?
The know goes to grandma's house and 

607
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:43,030
there's a big bad wolf waiting because 
wolves were fucking real band.

608
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,280
Like if people lived,

609
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,370
especially in parts of Europe,
especially in Russia,

610
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,060
like they got wolf problems.
Man Moves are scary.

611
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,360
They scared the shit out of any animal.
Really.

612
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,660
Any animal for sure,
but wolves,

613
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,870
I get scared of bugs,
man sometimes are just disgusting.

614
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,090
We talked about this yesterday.
Had scabies once.

615
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:04,380
That's gross.
That'll.

616
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,810
That'll do your heading scabies.
Oh my God.

617
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,500
I read about a dude from 1920 or 
wherever the fuck it was.

618
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:15,501
He was up in Canada trapping and he 
killed for wolves by shooting them and 

619
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:21,441
then like eight more by clubbing them to
death with his rifle before rifle,

620
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:24,810
but broke and then they killed him.
Wow.

621
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,990
Scary.

622
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:34,930
I'd be terrified.
I've still never seen a bear in the 

623
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:34,930
wild.
I have.

624
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,250
I'd like to see you.
It's embarrassing.

625
00:27:36,251 --> 00:27:37,970
So it's interesting.
Weird.

626
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,400
It's a weird for anybody to sell that as
a ring tone for color.

627
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,660
You just made $50,000,000.
Not that much.

628
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,980
I Bet I make 20 bucks dot.
Yeah.

629
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,130
We'll scare the shit out of me.
That's real.

630
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,420
What was it?
How is that possible that I.

631
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,440
I create a whatever time I was ever.
Rules are scary.

632
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,150
It's the DUBSTEP remix,
whatever.

633
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,270
Apple.
Just scary.

634
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,160
That's.
That's awesome.

635
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:13,620
Powerful.
Jim.

636
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:15,030
Jefferies.
Powerful.

637
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:17,190
That's where he text me this new thing.
Powerful.

638
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Powerful.
It's been around for years or is this 

639
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,620
the one American site?
I've been saying it for years and a bird

640
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,650
crusher says it and Duncan trussell 
says,

641
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:31,651
it already says that there's a poster 
over there that says we know what it 

642
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:37,131
all.
My friend laughed pretty strong against 

643
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:38,670
it from my friend Larry.
Larry used to Sadie.

644
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,700
It was his,
he would say powerful and he would do a 

645
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:43,700
head slap.
Powerful.

646
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:43,740
Yeah.

647
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,920
Was.
Was that Larry from the three?

648
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,110
No,
no,

649
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:50,320
no.
Like all this.

650
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,170
Too much information is coming in.
I auditioned the three stages.

651
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:57,230
Maybe you real fuck.
Why the stupidest the guy went in before

652
00:28:57,231 --> 00:29:02,231
me was the guy who got it like a but to 
play mo and everyone else was in the 

653
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:07,910
waiting room in outfits,
like really putting effort in and I 

654
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,711
hadn't put a lot of effort in and I.
It was like you had to do what I 

655
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:11,711
slapping,
right?

656
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,810
Probably saying yeah,
yeah,

657
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,260
yeah.
All by yourself.

658
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,660
Oh No,
there's no one there to slap.

659
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,810
And it was one of those things where 
we're like,

660
00:29:20,811 --> 00:29:21,630
you know,
like they,

661
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,900
they never tell you that you've done 
badly,

662
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:26,090
but they also.
Did I tell you,

663
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:27,110
your agent,
they go,

664
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:27,980
oh,
he was okay,

665
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:32,981
but we're going a different way because 
they don't want to have that 

666
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:32,981
conversation with the needy agent either
and so.

667
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,780
But they told my agent I was woeful,
that I was really,

668
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:37,700
really bad.
You will blow fly.

669
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:39,830
No,
I won't ever use the word willful.

670
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,740
No,
but I might have been phrasing there,

671
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:44,170
but I was.
I was pretty bad.

672
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,110
If you don't have anyone to slap though 
it does it look like you're just shooing

673
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:49,540
butterflies or something a little bit of
like.

674
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,270
Well you act like you're slapping it.
Yeah.

675
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:56,271
Hey.
And then like during the poking things 

676
00:29:56,271 --> 00:30:00,000
without doing the pool.
No one with me and just watched like two

677
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,150
students films that afternoon just to 
get me in the mood.

678
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:09,390
I was only meant to watch one but I kind
of enjoyed it so I watched another one 

679
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,230
you don't use.
They don't to come on in the audition 

680
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,391
wearing a complete green suit when it's 
green screen suits and the little balls 

681
00:30:15,391 --> 00:30:15,391
all over.

682
00:30:15,391 --> 00:30:19,530
You expect you to do that kind of 
improvisation or no person there with 

683
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:26,461
the guy who got it was the same guy who 
played Robin Williams in a bio TV show 

684
00:30:26,461 --> 00:30:29,650
about him,
like a NBC midday movie.

685
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,610
Good impression.
He must be a good impression,

686
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,280
but he had.
He had the wig and everything and he was

687
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:38,740
wrong in the waiting room.
He was already for it.

688
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,790
Where does it bring it?
Back to three stooges,

689
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:47,791
man.
That's officially out of ideas and they 

690
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:49,501
bring my Abbott and Costello who 
snookie's in the previous Abbott Abbott 

691
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:52,930
and Costello Man.
Really?

692
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,690
How could you do that?
Those were two actual people.

693
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,940
I'm going to start with the three 
stooges,

694
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,370
except they kept on replacing Mo with 
the other one,

695
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:05,371
sham or sharp or whatever,
but I always felt like they were 

696
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:06,580
characters and shuffle with us.
I always felt like,

697
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,820
like name,
you might as well bring wasn't shamp.

698
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,540
That guy's name really wasn't curly.
Yeah.

699
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,360
You're never going to bring back Lewis 
and Martin.

700
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,290
Yeah,
exactly.

701
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,820
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Yeah.

702
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,090
It seems like,
uh,

703
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:25,290
the characters you could bring back the 
character curly and have another guy 

704
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,560
play it,
maybe get away with it.

705
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,160
There was,
there was another students pick wasn't 

706
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,010
there where they had the guy from the 
shield playing.

707
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,530
Oh God.
Oh.

708
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,480
Michael Chiklis hired it.
And it was,

709
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:38,170
uh,
it was,

710
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:38,590
uh,
it was,

711
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:43,591
uh,
it was a mini series of three day mini 

712
00:31:43,591 --> 00:31:45,190
series and it was produced by Mel Gibson
because he's a big stooges guy.

713
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,050
That was a great show.
The Shield.

714
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,540
Whew.
That was one of my favorite cop shows,

715
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,430
man.
Oh yeah.

716
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:55,470
That was.
It was probably the most realistic cop 

717
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:55,470
show ever.
I saw this.

718
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:00,301
How realistic was I saw the.
Remember the guy that had like the real 

719
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:00,301
sort of weird bye guys.

720
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:03,040
It was when he killed his wife and the 
kid at the end,

721
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,430
I'll use the main characters especially 
to kept fucking up and fuck it up,

722
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,550
but he's a bit of a psychopath.
Would just kill people.

723
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:14,551
Yeah.
I saw him at whole foods like four days 

724
00:32:14,551 --> 00:32:14,770
ago and I got a little bit little chill 
like I'm at home.

725
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:18,220
I've actually had that.
Oh,

726
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:20,040
I wonder what he's going to kill 
someone.

727
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,250
I don't suck.
Well,

728
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:23,350
he was a perfect guy for that role.
To me.

729
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:26,140
He looked like that guy,
like dangerous,

730
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,320
thick looking crazy fuck cops shoot you 
and make up a story about it and pass a 

731
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:34,070
lie detector test.
I was.

732
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,400
It was good.
That was a good fucking show.

733
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,040
It really is weird that seeing people 
that you see on TV is in real

734
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:45,040
life though.
Like I saw that the guy from last the 

735
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,040
other day,
day at the dinged,

736
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,930
gone show.
The guy that was also in Lord of the 

737
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:48,930
Rings,
the Irish Guy,

738
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:49,760
Irish guy.
I'm just sitting there going,

739
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:55,180
he died at comedy.
Silly Bitch.

740
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,870
Yeah,
because they all died and you watched 

741
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:01,870
the last episode.
I wrote the hose.

742
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,760
I'm his.
I loved his story arc though.

743
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:06,210
That was a cool story.
Like you know,

744
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,680
him being in that band can hooked on.
Smack was.

745
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,980
It was fear.
That was a good storyline.

746
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,510
Which he started banging that bird.
Who was the lead out of it.

747
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,840
That was pretty good for him.
So he was a real life because he was a 

748
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,960
hobbit before that and that's a big 
leap.

749
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,430
Leap.
Lily.

750
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,550
That girl is fucking pretty.
I was a cake guy.

751
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,620
I liked the cake girl.
Oh,

752
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,930
it's fucking pretty too.

753
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,600
And she got her teeth fixed.
I don't know.

754
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,880
She had a little gap gap.
Gap Gap.

755
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,250
Yeah.
Worry about that guy.

756
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:47,290
Trying to think of hot.
Getting hot gap women throughout hot 

757
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:47,290
man.
I like it.

758
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,210
A little gap.
Lego.

759
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,460
Yeah.
Who some hot gap,

760
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,310
but donor in a day.
Was it a hot women?

761
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,380
I find Bella,
Donna hot chicks with flaws of the best 

762
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,770
hot but with like one little nagging 
webbed feet,

763
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,680
webbed feet,
nagging thing.

764
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,810
You don't want to just be like missing a
tick.

765
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:13,870
You want it to be feared webbed feet.
Would you separate that shit or would 

766
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,250
you just go aquaman type pity?
I would show it to people.

767
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,290
It was just like one web show,
like a big toe to the next one.

768
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,900
Just on one foot.
I would rock it out.

769
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,360
Well,
what is the webbed feet about?

770
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:28,390
I don't know,
but what's the president actually 

771
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,740
developed that Rick,
Jesus Christ fader webbed in the womb 

772
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:34,070
and the last thing that happens,
the buddy in the toe separate in 

773
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,070
separate.

774
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,930
And I think it's just the last little 
bit didn't,

775
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,280
didn't happen.
That's interesting.

776
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,710
What's the percentage of the small toe 
being retarded?

777
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:40,840
Because I haven't,
you know,

778
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,730
my brother,
my pinkies are pretty much retarded.

779
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:46,430
Like there's something wrong with it or 
my little toe,

780
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,220
you know,
everyone's a little crooked and it looks

781
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:54,221
like a pig tail.
And then like the toe nail doesn't 

782
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:54,221
really grow.
Tell you,

783
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:54,480
let me see.
But you know,

784
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:57,530
you told me that you slept in those.
So I'm gonna say no,

785
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,160
I'll have a look at it.
Can you can target me.

786
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:06,161
Oh,
I always find it weird when you see the 

787
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:06,520
girls who get it because I keep my 
toenails clipped.

788
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,820
I imagine I do a fair job,
but nothing remarkable and goal.

789
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,230
It's clipped denial so much that she 
just does that like little toenail.

790
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,700
It's not like it's just slid up the and 
made us what?

791
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,540
And then the ghost steel ball is to 
paint it that little bit.

792
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:26,300
Just over the top.
It's like when you see that girl put red

793
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:28,520
lipstick on and she smears it a little 
or something.

794
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,300
That is kind of weird.
That little phantom last toenail.

795
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,400
So you don't have the nail,
you just have to slither.

796
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,290
I have this sliver sometimes it doesn't 
even grow.

797
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,040
Everything is just taking it off and 
just

798
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,420
being done with it.
Yeah.

799
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,630
Use of it.
Comes up with these nails,

800
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:43,980
man.
That's the weird thing.

801
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,210
Things that grow a useless,
right?

802
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:49,980
Yeah,
they're useful.

803
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
The good for clogging,
but they're so weak you just don't know 

804
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,651
how to use them yet,
but your toenails useless fuckers and 

805
00:35:57,651 --> 00:36:00,311
they was stronger than the hand.
What do you think that caveman had like 

806
00:36:00,311 --> 00:36:03,000
much stronger fingernails from.
If you were Jack and things with your 

807
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,480
nails all the time.
Would they get thicker wood?

808
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,910
They grow long.
They get real sick in the back of it and

809
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,320
look at a Guinness Book of records stuff
that kind of them.

810
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,330
Because if once I said as long as joins 
that blood flow and she did not curling 

811
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,040
and stuff.
Hold Up,

812
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,770
son joins your bloodflow yeah.
When they.

813
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,210
When I'm talking,
when they get like,

814
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,300
yeah.
Then they get there and I start curling 

815
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,300
and Qa.

816
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

817
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,940
I reckon these people have to have 
special surgery because I kind of just 

818
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:29,940
caught them at the base.
Oh my God.

819
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,210
That's become an extension of you more 
than just fucking Christ.

820
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:38,211
You're a tree God damn nail tree.
That's supposed to turn into your 

821
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:39,630
trends.
Like what would,

822
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,120
if that was supposed to do that for a 
reason,

823
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:47,121
like you were supposed to grow up with 
that big and it's turned into like a 

824
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,420
time machine.
That's always the theory of evolution.

825
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:50,610
It's like whenever something new is on 
the human body,

826
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:52,590
we cut it out.
We go and we don't know what this is.

827
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:57,591
We're cutting it out.
What if these persons is the most 

828
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:57,591
evolved person?
I don't know,

829
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:58,710
like an Ipod is growing out of their arm
or something.

830
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,570
What if you cut his nails off and then 
he has like the phantom nail itch.

831
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,380
We feel some touching things.
They're not there anymore.

832
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,010
It feels like,
you know,

833
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,420
amputated his hand.
That guy had like nerve damage because 

834
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,510
the guy in the Guinness Book.
Yeah,

835
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,930
there's a whole lot of them that are 
into it.

836
00:37:16,931 --> 00:37:18,220
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

837
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,300
You got to Indie Shit like that.
Just in these weird man.

838
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,640
You just see it is weird and he's just a
weird place.

839
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,650
There's a lot of people,
right?

840
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,780
So anytime you get a lot of people,
you've got a billion people think I have

841
00:37:28,781 --> 00:37:30,960
any weird people in America with 330 
million.

842
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,560
Go it.
India got a billion.

843
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,290
It's a lot more weirdness that can.
That can carry on.

844
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,260
Yeah,
I would imagine.

845
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,760
It's like that's what I always thinking 
that America gets a bad rep because 

846
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,490
Australians and British are always going
on about how idiotic Americans 

847
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,610
Americans.
It's just that you get to publicize yos 

848
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,340
more Americans aren't any more stupid 
than the British or Australian.

849
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,230
Yeah,

850
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,350
well they're stupid people all over.

851
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,610
Oh,
over the world.

852
00:37:52,611 --> 00:37:55,180
But you have more of them because you 
just per capita,

853
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:56,900
you'd have more of them.
It might be that,

854
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,150
but it also might be,
this is a this.

855
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,110
This is a country that's lived in 
prosperity for so long.

856
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,150
There's a lot of soft minded folks who 
haven't had.

857
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,220
They haven't had the question the way 
things are really running.

858
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:15,221
They haven't had to investigate things.
They sort of sat back and let let 

859
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:16,580
everything sort of happened.
It wasn't until recently.

860
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:21,581
I think that people are finally starting
to realize that you really can't do 

861
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:26,051
that.
You can't just trust the government 

862
00:38:26,051 --> 00:38:26,180
because they can't be trusted that they 
run a muck.

863
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,580
There's a lot of people though that 
haven't done that yet.

864
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,340
Nah,
they recognize me.

865
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,300
Forty percent of all Americans have 
passports,

866
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:34,270
so that's the one that I always find 
upsetting.

867
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,200
It's incredible.

868
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:40,330
It would be at least 90 percent of my 
passports because it's isolated country,

869
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,850
but there's a bit of you that goes,
well,

870
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:47,020
maybe that's because in America you can 
go to Disneyland.

871
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,590
It's already there.
You know,

872
00:38:48,591 --> 00:38:51,760
like we're all coming on holidays over 
over to see your shit.

873
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,160
You've already got all your shit and 
it's very nice.

874
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,810
Yeah,
I know.

875
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,340
This is a strange country,
ma'am.

876
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,240
They're all strange.
George Bush sport and still he was 

877
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,240
president.
That's amazing,

878
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,840
isn't it?
Yeah.

879
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,650
Any president.
What was he doing before?

880
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,180
Yeah,
if I can pass for any and he goes,

881
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,950
powerful man in the world and never 
traveled.

882
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,230
Just traveled under different names.
He's a fascinating dude.

883
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:23,310
I would love to drink with George Bush 
and just find out what the fuck he 

884
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,370
really thinks about things.
Can you imagine?

885
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,660
I have a friend who,
and I can't say his name because he's a 

886
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,330
fairly famous actor.
Well,

887
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,170
I have a friend who shagged one of these
girls.

888
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,520
Dude,
you just open up a can and shit.

889
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:42,290
He just opened up a can of shit.
They're going to find you and they're 

890
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,290
gonna waterboard your ass until you give
up that dude.

891
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,180
We're already dead for real,
man.

892
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:47,950
You can't just come on our show and do 
that.

893
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,420
Like I know that people are fucked dude.
That's not what I heard.

894
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,640
I just want to know if these ticklers,
if he's George W is,

895
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:05,100
what do you think actually happened to 
him when he had that black guy and he 

896
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:05,440
said he ate a pretzel and choked and 
blacked out and fell down.

897
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,430
I believe.
Exactly.

898
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:11,431
That's what happened.
I can see him eating a pretzel and 

899
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:13,440
frequently.
I think that's what happened as well 

900
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:13,440
because you'd make up unless idiotic 
life.

901
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,050
His Dad,
his dad put up a fucking leather glove 

902
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,100
on it,
slapped him,

903
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,070
beat his ass while he was eating a 
pretzel.

904
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,830
Maybe you start talking some shit like,
well,

905
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:26,240
who's the president now is Emilio used 
to be.

906
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:27,010
You're right.
Yeah,

907
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:27,910
but it's me now.
Right?

908
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,620
Cool.
I just want to know.

909
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,750
You did one term right now.
I'm on my second fucker.

910
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:37,540
Just put on leather glove tickled and 
Herbert Walker.

911
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,570
George senior was the head of the CIA.
The dude was no joke.

912
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:49,130
He'd probably interrogated them.
So you got to say fell off both of them.

913
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:54,460
Would you like.
Did you like the good guys in your mind?

914
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,190
Well,
not based on anything they ever did with

915
00:40:57,191 --> 00:41:00,130
the world.
I don't know them personally.

916
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,970
I think drugs would be a cool guy to 
hang out with.

917
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:06,220
Just seems like a bit of a laugh.
I bet he.

918
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:10,170
I bet if you could really pick that 
guy's brain if you know,

919
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,300
if you were given access to this memory 
banks,

920
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,510
I bet it would be quite fascinating 
because I bet that's a guy who's just a 

921
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,590
puppet just to fucking happy guy.
Who was a,

922
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,930
you know,
a guy who was part of a big,

923
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:27,931
influential family and I think they just
told him what to say and he went out and

924
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:30,300
said it looks like.

925
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:37,930
What's he doing now?
You some time Clintons always doing 

926
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:41,591
stuff.
George hasn't done nothing since he's 

927
00:41:41,591 --> 00:41:43,451
left.
He's probably watching this on this 

928
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:43,451
change.
Just got a new heart,

929
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:43,451
you know,
they just gave him a new heart.

930
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,140
The Tin Man.
Yeah man,

931
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,750
they got a heart transplant.
Apparently before that he had a machine 

932
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,740
hooked up like some sort of a pump in 
his body.

933
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,370
So no,
no.

934
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,150
It's more complicated.
Whatever it did,

935
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:57,770
it didn't.
He didn't have a pulse anymore.

936
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:02,771
This thing sort of helped him pump the 
blood and like if you try to do as 

937
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:07,511
pulse,
who would have no pulse but he was 

938
00:42:07,511 --> 00:42:07,511
alive.
Why?

939
00:42:07,511 --> 00:42:10,990
Yeah.
But why wouldn't you still have a 

940
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:10,990
potent?
No,

941
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,620
apparently not because it wasn't pumping
into pulsing way.

942
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:14,450
He was just pumping in a stream.
It was like,

943
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,750
well,
you know what I'm saying by that it 

944
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,750
wasn't going.
It was just flowing.

945
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,750
Exactly.
I think that's the.

946
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:24,790
That's what I would guess,
but being an idiot and know nothing 

947
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:24,790
about medical science,
I like to think of.

948
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,390
It's one of the things that I use that a
fireplace.

949
00:42:26,391 --> 00:42:31,391
They put a bellows fellow,
but that was one of those things that 

950
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:33,250
you saw from petrol with gasoline.
Yeah.

951
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:38,120
I guess that the pump though is the 
actual heart muscle working.

952
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,480
You know the pump is the actual heart 
muscle pushing it out.

953
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,360
It's the heart muscle is not working and
this pump is doing so.

954
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,550
Is it an artificial heart?
Is that what it is?

955
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Whatever the fuck it was.
He didn't have a pulse because of this 

956
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,170
thing and then they opened them up.
Hurts are weird.

957
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:59,230
Fuck,
I don't know how to become synonymous 

958
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,920
with luxury is fucking things.
Well,

959
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:04,490
there's a reason for it and the reason 
they recently discovered,

960
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:09,550
and this is just I think within the last
couple of years that there's at least as

961
00:43:09,681 --> 00:43:14,681
many neurons in the heart as there are 
in the brain theory about where someone 

962
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:19,400
gets a heart transplant.

963
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,520
I've heard these stories where someone 
gets a heart transplant and then all of 

964
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:24,520
a sudden I can speak French.
No,

965
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,390
that we give too much credit to the 
brain and other organs can do shit.

966
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,850
Well that's you know.
I don't know if that's real or not.

967
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:33,851
I don't know if anybody's ever come to 
an organ transplant and given a 

968
00:43:33,851 --> 00:43:38,471
depiction of the person's life,
but if you were going to do it from any 

969
00:43:38,471 --> 00:43:38,471
organ transplant,
I would say the heart,

970
00:43:38,471 --> 00:43:41,370
a bad candidate because of all the 
neurons in see,

971
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,940
they don't know where the fuck your 
memory comes from.

972
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:49,040
Memories a mystery because every cell in
your body is replaced every seven years.

973
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,250
Your cells all get replaced like there's
a new device,

974
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:54,350
but it's stored or you're saying,
here's the issue.

975
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,110
It go those cells,
those brain cells to regenerate.

976
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,100
They all,
all of them.

977
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:03,100
Every one doesn't though is neurons.
Neurons apparently you keep for life 

978
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:08,580
kind of brain hurts.
Like if you heard part of the brain,

979
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,660
they know where memory is stored based 
on people getting injuries to specific 

980
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,900
locations of the brain.
Like how their brain,

981
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:15,750
you know how they,
you know,

982
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:18,560
like they know like the,
like fun frontal lobe academies.

983
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:24,120
They figured that out.
They knew where they could do them to 

984
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,471
Zombie you out.
They found the right spot where the 

985
00:44:26,471 --> 00:44:26,471
dude,
by the way,

986
00:44:26,471 --> 00:44:29,760
one of the fucking Nobel prize,
the guy who made lobotomies won a Nobel 

987
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,410
prize.
They thought he was awesome.

988
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:34,980
I do way to go hit Louis.
Tom's man and you silence these retards.

989
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,680
You fucking drill a hole in their head 
and scoop out their brains.

990
00:44:37,681 --> 00:44:39,060
I was like,
shock therapy.

991
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,940
It's pretty crazy.
Do you ever say that?

992
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,580
I had a close relative go through that 
when?

993
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,720
When they were younger.
Really?

994
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:52,110
Yeah,
the right down on the drive down the 

995
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,110
rabbit stake and if I can see we're 
going to fucking mic.

996
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:59,320
Like this whole idea that we're going to
kill the psycho out of you with 

997
00:44:59,320 --> 00:44:59,320
electric.
Like oh,

998
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:04,040
that's.
That was happening right up until the 

999
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,040
eighties in Australia.
Shock therapy.

1000
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,680
And that's,
that's like so close to when they like 

1001
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,340
bleeding and using leeches in medicine.
Like to go,

1002
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,010
Oh yeah,
we'll just electrocute people.

1003
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:16,530
Well it's electricity seemed so cool and
so powerful.

1004
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:21,770
It's like,
well let's just hook them up to that 

1005
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:21,770
shit.
See if it fixes it.

1006
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:22,320
This kind of schizophrenia.
This'll help.

1007
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,530
Could you imagine what that must fucking
feel like.

1008
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,250
I'm fighting it because you're already a
bit mental and then the nurse is holding

1009
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:32,340
you down.
When you think about doing this,

1010
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:37,341
how did it start off?
Did they do it on mice first and then 

1011
00:45:37,341 --> 00:45:37,341
we're like,
wow,

1012
00:45:37,341 --> 00:45:37,341
that mouse is crazy.
And then they shocked.

1013
00:45:37,341 --> 00:45:37,380
It was like,
oh,

1014
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:38,790
it's not,
it's not moving around.

1015
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,500
She blinded me with.
That's funny.

1016
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,960
Yeah.
How did they figure that out?

1017
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:51,960
Some crazy ass hole started on humans.
It just doesn't seem right.

1018
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,210
The same Nobel prize winning asshole.
Scrambling people's.

1019
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,860
We look back like cause bleeding.
It's got to be the most stupid of them.

1020
00:45:58,861 --> 00:46:00,210
All right.
When you're really sick.

1021
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,240
Yeah.
They cut all your blood out and dripped 

1022
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,071
it into balls because they thought 
they're getting when you needed more 

1023
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:07,071
than ever.
Yeah.

1024
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:11,480
Are we going to in 50 years go.
They used to give these kids that 

1025
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:16,790
couldn't breathe these little puffers 
that made it worse and gave them,

1026
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,580
you know,
they're going to be things from now that

1027
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,950
we're going to look back at and go,
that was fucking man.

1028
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:24,510
It's well chemotherapy saying like,
man,

1029
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,850
you know,
it'll seem like madness,

1030
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,880
prescription drug abuse.
When they find out how many different 

1031
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,460
people are hooked on all sorts of 
different pain killers.

1032
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,750
Some real American thing.
I.

1033
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,590
I'd never been in Britain.
It's where I'm taking most of my drugs.

1034
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:38,890
No,
I never met anyone that wanted to.

1035
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,610
I never knew what an Oxycontin was there
until a couple of years ago.

1036
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:46,740
Government is better at filtering the 
stuff and doesn't have socialized 

1037
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:46,750
medicine.
Yeah.

1038
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:49,410
That's the difference right there.
It's probably not as easy to get.

1039
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,080
See in America,
it's real easy to get that stuff.

1040
00:46:52,081 --> 00:46:55,350
All you have to do is be injured 
pharmaceutical drugs or you know,

1041
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,390
really.
You know,

1042
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:01,490
they've helped a lot of people,
a lot of people have benefited for sure 

1043
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,040
from,
from discoveries that have been in.

1044
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,860
He kept people alive.
That would have been dead.

1045
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,100
A lot of really cool things have been 
discovered,

1046
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:11,700
but there's also a,
a lot of money and pharmaceutical drugs.

1047
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,760
Sure.
Whenever there's a lot of money in 

1048
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,261
something and that's something just 
happens to be addictive and then the 

1049
00:47:18,261 --> 00:47:18,261
money starts pouring in.

1050
00:47:18,261 --> 00:47:22,640
Well they get addicted to that money.
You can't tell a pharmaceutical company 

1051
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,670
that loses,
you know,

1052
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,570
eight,
10,000

1053
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:26,480
people a year to whatever the fuck 
they're selling.

1054
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:28,710
You can't tell them that you're,
you can't,

1055
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,090
you can't sell that stuff anymore.
You got to stop.

1056
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:35,270
Everyone in America has this little 
thing like we obviously without jobs fly

1057
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:40,271
a lot and whenever I get on a plane,
like I speak to my management or agents 

1058
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:40,271
or something,
I go,

1059
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:44,940
fuck it.
I want to just fly to kind of sleep on 

1060
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:44,940
pines.
Those just take a Xanax easy,

1061
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,630
just take a xanax and they say it so 
bland sight.

1062
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:48,730
You're like,
no,

1063
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:53,731
it's.
And then you think these are what these 

1064
00:47:53,731 --> 00:47:53,731
people are doing.
Just when they were home in bed,

1065
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:59,220
tossing and turning a little bit.
Sometimes it's just fucking hard to go 

1066
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,341
to sleep.
Right next week is that I will dump my 

1067
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,180
railroad went off about Xanax.

1068
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,850
He's been taking it for four or five 
years.

1069
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:10,300
Talking about it.
I don't think so.

1070
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,340
It didn't sound like he liked it sounded
like you needed.

1071
00:48:12,341 --> 00:48:15,940
It sounded like he enjoyed it.
He likes it.

1072
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,530
Yeah,
I know what I mean.

1073
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:17,980
Yeah.
No,

1074
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:19,540
I get complete what you're saying.
Yeah.

1075
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,790
There's a lot of people on that stuff 
though.

1076
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,770
It's a real common strain.
Child Heath Ledger and all.

1077
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:30,830
Then we can hit legend.
Never was a recreational drug taker at 

1078
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:34,081
all really.
But he just got really into like our 

1079
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:36,190
numerous loop and didn't sleep well.
There's a long fucking days.

1080
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:37,900
There's a lot of people.
Yeah,

1081
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:39,490
those,
those movie star dudes.

1082
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,870
So it seems like an easy life.
But when you're on a site,

1083
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,330
you might have to work 16 hours a day 
and you have to put out all that energy.

1084
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:48,490
A lot of them get sick,
a lot of them need B,

1085
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:49,450
12 shots.

1086
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:54,930
It's not an easy man,
especially when you're acting at that 

1087
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:54,930
level.
You know,

1088
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:57,040
like I was a bad motherfucker.
He was a good actor.

1089
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,380
Made out with a dude.
Yeah,

1090
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,440
they went out of strong.
I've seen seen the last three short yet 

1091
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:08,340
that I see what?
Life's too short.

1092
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:11,380
The new a ricky device TV show.
No,

1093
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,310
just a sharp that dwarfs.
It's funny to sit calm about Dorson HPI,

1094
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:20,311
but if you haven't seen no references,
basically they make a whole lot of 

1095
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:23,851
dwarfs go through a famous scenes in 
movie history and there's a brokeback 

1096
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:27,700
mountain.
It was just funny to watch it to English

1097
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:29,260
doors going.
I'm definitely gay.

1098
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,360
Oh my word.
I'm enjoying this,

1099
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:35,000
but if you haven't seen it,
I'm not going to talk about.

1100
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,710
I haven't seen it.
It's great.

1101
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:43,740
It's very good.
What was that video you were showing me 

1102
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:44,740
earlier from the bone zone of students 
kissing each other.

1103
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,540
How do people find that?
Oh yeah.

1104
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:51,541
If you go on Youtube,
it's randy littky and Davey Johnson and 

1105
00:49:51,581 --> 00:49:56,581
the video is called an intimate moment 
on the bone zone and that's just from 

1106
00:49:56,581 --> 00:49:59,410
one of the podcasts we do at desk squad.
Brendan Walsh,

1107
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,490
who was,
um,

1108
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,350
I think he's in.
Where's he at?

1109
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:07,351
Somewhere in Seattle or something 
somewhere because he asked me to tweet 

1110
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:09,680
it.
Uh,

1111
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:14,020
but he's got a podcast on the desk squad
and it's called the bone zone.

1112
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,330
That's,
he's a fucking funny dude.

1113
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:21,360
So anything he's doing so kissing,
kissing in every episode.

1114
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:24,730
And so we.
It's really funny though.

1115
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,740
They're really funny guys.
Seattle?

1116
00:50:26,741 --> 00:50:28,520
Yeah.
He's so Seattle folks.

1117
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:32,420
He's a in Vancouver tonight and tomorrow
too.

1118
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:35,780
So look on Brendan Walsh Dot Com.
Oh,

1119
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,560
there you go.
Brendan and I gave you a plug.

1120
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,780
Fuck,
check this out.

1121
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:45,370
I asked Don as Don Burris has been 
locked out of his own facebook account 

1122
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:49,580
for four days a hacker,
but we were just saying some nice things

1123
00:50:49,581 --> 00:50:50,360
about Brendan Walsh.

1124
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:55,410
I have to go negative.
I just trying to see Brendan Walsh.

1125
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:56,910
No,
but Brendan Walsh.

1126
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,860
It's Hilarious,
isn't he?

1127
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:58,580
Yeah.
Brian,

1128
00:50:58,581 --> 00:50:59,840
shouldn't people go see him?
Yeah,

1129
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,330
I don't really,
I don't really know him,

1130
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:07,331
but he sounds very funny,
but somebody took his fucking facebook 

1131
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:10,901
account and changed all his email and 
stuff and now he can't get back into it 

1132
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,451
and facebook won't help them at all.
So like now there's just somebody 

1133
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:14,480
looking out all this shit,
looking at his photos.

1134
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:18,010
I have an ex girlfriend that hates him,
know somebody hacked his shit.

1135
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,030
Everyone's one of those.
Yeah.

1136
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:24,930
But does he have um,
does he have enemies or people you know,

1137
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,460
all that shit he does with a scary Perry
and all the,

1138
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,090
you know,
that shit like that,

1139
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,620
that there might be people that are 
against that or something.

1140
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,760
Yeah,
if you don't know he,

1141
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:35,780
they did a movie.

1142
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,880
What is the name of the windy city he 
did?

1143
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:38,900
Oh,
I love this movie.

1144
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,740
I love that film.
And was a part of that.

1145
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:47,320
It's paid it does it cool moments and 
then you just have to remember that that

1146
00:51:47,321 --> 00:51:50,780
caused a bit of an assault.
He's a weird guy to be around,

1147
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,520
that's for sure.
But wow.

1148
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,430
They took it deep.
I mean they,

1149
00:51:54,431 --> 00:51:59,431
they,
they made a movie about this guy being 

1150
00:51:59,431 --> 00:51:59,431
famous and he really believed it.
I mean,

1151
00:51:59,431 --> 00:52:04,090
to me that's like a part of that is like
you're picking on mental illness is 

1152
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,360
clearly this guy's.
There's a disconnect between this guy in

1153
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:08,120
reality,
like it's funny Sorta,

1154
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,940
but man,
you talking about like the ultimate,

1155
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:14,210
the joke's on you picking on a crazy 
person,

1156
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,440
but one thing it might be that's 
different than that argument is that the

1157
00:52:18,441 --> 00:52:22,180
crazy people all want to be comics or 
actors so they know what they're doing.

1158
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:28,060
What we've done,
we've done Ip and Anthony together a 

1159
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,580
fair bit and every time I do it,
one of the RSA re todd's one of the 

1160
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:36,490
crazies that are on the show.
Sometimes I go home feeling a little bit

1161
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,010
down about it and then I remember that I
love it.

1162
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,620
That's their lives.
They've got a level of fame.

1163
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,680
They go to these conventions or 
whatever.

1164
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:47,840
When I'd be anti do things on the road 
and they get big.

1165
00:52:47,841 --> 00:52:52,841
Round of applause isn't very exciting,
but it is just picking on a mental.

1166
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:57,870
You'll perse.
I think there's a way to do it in a way 

1167
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:57,870
not to do it.
Dawn does it,

1168
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,540
right.
Like one of the guys is schizophrenia,

1169
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:02,330
surfer guy.
I used to do open mics with this guy and

1170
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:07,500
he,
he's got schizophrenia and he's really 

1171
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,641
hardcore schizophrenia.
But he would do like an act and then 

1172
00:53:09,641 --> 00:53:12,821
like afterwards I would always try to 
talk to him but he would like look past 

1173
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:12,821
me and,
and it was weird.

1174
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:17,250
But what is schizophrenia entail?
What else was wrong with to 

1175
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:17,780
personalities,
right?

1176
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,290
I don't know.
He's just really,

1177
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:24,730
it seems like that's not bipolar is not 
to personally bought Paul is Paul 

1178
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:26,180
depression that's up as being dead.

1179
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,320
Schizophrenia is you start believing 
you,

1180
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:34,340
someone else going in and out of 
different personalities sometimes you 

1181
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:38,631
can talk to other times you just looked 
past here and plus the fact that he 

1182
00:53:38,631 --> 00:53:38,631
smokes weed on top of that.
It's kind of like really weird.

1183
00:53:38,631 --> 00:53:40,320
But uh,
but he's a real nice guy,

1184
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:44,040
but as an example that I used to do open
open minds with him and now he's fucking

1185
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:45,330
love and doing the Dingdong show.

1186
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,210
Okay.
This is,

1187
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,040
it is,
um,

1188
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:52,110
it makes it difficult to tell the 
difference between real and unreal 

1189
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:52,110
experiences.
Think logically,

1190
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:55,990
have normal emotional responses.
Behave normally in social situations.

1191
00:53:55,991 --> 00:53:57,180
So.
Huh?

1192
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:58,870
So what's the jewel personality?
One?

1193
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,750
A will you can.
There's,

1194
00:54:01,751 --> 00:54:06,751
I think there's a will.
There's people that don't believe in 

1195
00:54:06,751 --> 00:54:08,360
multiple personality disorder.
They think it's horse shit.

1196
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,790
There are people that think it's horse 
shit.

1197
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,170
Hey,
they just want attention.

1198
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:11,770
Yeah.

1199
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:16,080
Yeah.
I don't know anybody that was threatened

1200
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,730
friend and he's a good friend of mine,
but I have a friend of mine who uh,

1201
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,940
who says that he had a split 
personality,

1202
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:28,170
but it was just whenever he acted like 
an asshole that was,

1203
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,750
oh,
that was such and such just came out and

1204
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:31,410
you're like,
Nah,

1205
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:34,140
he just did not say that.
Your,

1206
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:37,140
you and you're good.
Were you when your bed as well?

1207
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,360
Yeah,
that's ridiculous.

1208
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,300
Um,
some people have it I guess.

1209
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:44,670
I guess a dissociative identity 
disorder.

1210
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,580
Their fence rail.

1211
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,800
Well it is,
but it's people who actually changed 

1212
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:50,800
their name and I'm candy now and I have 
a dog.

1213
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,340
Yeah.
Well,

1214
00:54:51,341 --> 00:54:54,730
you know who did that was I'm the dude,
a Herschel Walker.

1215
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,330
Herschel Walker apparently had some 
serious problems with visual.

1216
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:03,900
Oh,
he's a famous football player who's an 

1217
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,110
older guy and he's now competing in mma.
He's like,

1218
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:09,160
he's in his time.
He was like one of the greatest football

1219
00:55:09,161 --> 00:55:12,700
players of all time,
ridiculous athlete and now he's 48 years

1220
00:55:12,701 --> 00:55:16,000
old,
shredded just and just destroying people

1221
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:17,590
in mixed martial arts fights.

1222
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,410
And that was his background is a kid 
from Australia.

1223
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:27,411
You got signed up to I think one of the 
big NFL teams yesterday.

1224
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,800
And uh,
never held an American football.

1225
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,540
That's amazing.
You played rugby,

1226
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:37,541
but they just made him dula tackling 
stuff and then statistically is off the 

1227
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:41,531
chart,
straight into the NFL and never touched 

1228
00:55:41,531 --> 00:55:41,531
a ball.
That's incredible.

1229
00:55:41,531 --> 00:55:42,530
Yeah.
The NFL wants super athletes.

1230
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,910
You know,
he's like 26,

1231
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:46,040
eight,
just powerhouse top of Blake's.

1232
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:46,760
Fuck.

1233
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:52,540
There's some people you get around them.
You can't believe that that's a real 

1234
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:52,540
person.
That's a person to like,

1235
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,000
I'm the same as that person with the 
same.

1236
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:58,610
He's given me check.
There's a guy and he's the uncle Jonah 

1237
00:55:58,610 --> 00:55:58,710
Lomu,
who's fairly well,

1238
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,030
uh,
like portrayed in that movie addict this

1239
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:04,890
or whatever.
What about the rugby World Cup?

1240
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,860
But that's the biggest kind of that.
What's that movie?

1241
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,850
The one with met diamond and a fucking 
okay.

1242
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,800
Nelson Mandela.
I didn't see them.

1243
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,440
It was that good.
That was pretty good,

1244
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:18,300
man.
He did a fucking excellent.

1245
00:56:18,301 --> 00:56:21,470
Nelson Mandela.
I've ever get a gig data.

1246
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,710
No know.
I'll hook you up with this guy,

1247
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:24,520
man.
He likes big.

1248
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:25,930
Yeah,
it's fucking great man.

1249
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:28,030
There's the people are awesome.
The food is outstanding.

1250
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,700
You just kind of walked the streets 
right?

1251
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:34,030
It's just one of those things where it's
barbwire fences and shit everywhere.

1252
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,220
She's spot on.
How dangerous is it?

1253
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:39,040
They,
you lucky guns up in lockers when you're

1254
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:42,640
going to the casino and you'll see like 
everyone pulling their gun out and just,

1255
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:47,730
Oh my God and this,
but you just don't go through the 

1256
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:48,790
townships and you don't try not to have 
sex with anyone for a couple of weeks.

1257
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:50,740
That's about,
you know what I mean?

1258
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:56,040
Africa is Africa.
There was a story about a guy

1259
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:58,430
who,
uh,

1260
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:03,540
took his girlfriend to Africa and 
arrange for her to be kidnapped and they

1261
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:08,770
kidnapped her and killed her crazy 
fucking story,

1262
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:13,771
man that he,
he got down there and he convinced 

1263
00:57:13,771 --> 00:57:14,530
someone to,
uh,

1264
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,430
to,
to kidnap her and uh,

1265
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:22,470
you know,
he was gonna get the ransom money from 

1266
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:23,080
like her pants or something like that 
and they just fucking killed her.

1267
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,080
Yeah.
No ransom money for Dave.

1268
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:26,990
He kidnapped.

1269
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:27,790
Well,
one,

1270
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:32,910
one story.
The other story is that he had or 

1271
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:32,910
killed,
you know,

1272
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:33,000
he wanted to move on to some new girls,
so he had her killed,

1273
00:57:33,001 --> 00:57:34,590
which is even fucking crazy.

1274
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:35,900
Yeah.
Just break up with him.

1275
00:57:35,901 --> 00:57:37,110
I know I can be

1276
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:39,160
dude.
Just get deep.

1277
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,770
They just get deep into it and they got 
to get out.

1278
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:42,730
Get out now.

1279
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,170
Yeah.
The other ways for her to die,

1280
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,440
but you can see Lions and tigers.
It's pretty exciting.

1281
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,870
What a fucked up thing to do.
Man.

1282
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,400
Hired somebody to kidnap your check.
I would love that.

1283
00:57:53,401 --> 00:57:57,430
That when you said there's news stories 
and tap into a semi Thompson,

1284
00:57:57,431 --> 00:58:02,431
which news stories where some moms like 
tromping along these black men rip 

1285
00:58:03,201 --> 00:58:07,940
tattoos just opened the door and stole 
my car with my child and it and then you

1286
00:58:07,941 --> 00:58:12,941
got back cause got to end up in the 
swamp and you put them in the seat belt 

1287
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:13,310
and this is going to be awesome.
Right?

1288
00:58:13,311 --> 00:58:16,100
But like,
but now it makes you suspicious of every

1289
00:58:16,101 --> 00:58:19,610
person who ever cries and TV.
You always watched them going yet you're

1290
00:58:19,611 --> 00:58:21,500
a killer.
I always go straight through.

1291
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,380
Well,
when you find out that they are,

1292
00:58:23,381 --> 00:58:25,120
it is the weirdest feeling in the world,

1293
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,670
especially if you've been supporting 
them.

1294
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,470
If you need going,
that poor lady that pull out.

1295
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,400
If you feel cheated as the public,
you're like,

1296
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:31,440
how many times have women?
Yeah.

1297
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,740
Then busted doing that where they didn't
know that they were guilty and then they

1298
00:58:34,741 --> 00:58:35,220
caught them

1299
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:38,440
in America at Capa.
But there is a,

1300
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:44,190
there is a case in the UK which has been
going on for fucking ever.

1301
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:46,620
And what's,
um,

1302
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,340
maddie anyway,
very,

1303
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,760
very famous clients in the UK where they
were.

1304
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:56,650
This couple went on holiday in Portugal 
that I were in a resort type thing.

1305
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,130
They left the kid.
Um,

1306
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,660
uh,
madeline mccain was named the logo.

1307
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:04,240
And so I left Maryland Mccain in this 
room.

1308
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:06,240
They went off and had dinner like 50 
meters away.

1309
00:59:06,241 --> 00:59:07,920
She was five years old.
Ladies left.

1310
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:10,840
Are they sleeping when they got back?
She was gone right now.

1311
00:59:10,841 --> 00:59:13,690
The case has never been opened,
but people are still of the opinion that

1312
00:59:13,691 --> 00:59:17,350
maybe they did it.
Maybe they'd been,

1313
00:59:17,351 --> 00:59:22,351
no one can prove.
And then like maybe some pedophile did 

1314
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:23,330
it.
Maybe some whatever did it.

1315
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,890
But it's,
uh,

1316
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,420
it,
it,

1317
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:30,530
it's a real big case.
Like the extended last time we talked 

1318
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:33,131
back to Britain,
they had pictures of a five years on 

1319
00:59:33,131 --> 00:59:33,470
computer generated what she'd look like 
now.

1320
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:38,471
So to keep,
keep looking for like the parents are 

1321
00:59:38,471 --> 00:59:39,370
still like putting an assistant creepy 
when they do that fake person.

1322
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,840
I used to,
I used to do a joke.

1323
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,950
I went,
how long are we going to keep this going

1324
00:59:42,951 --> 00:59:44,120
for?
Oh,

1325
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:47,660
I got I hope another six years so we can
get that whole picture of when she's 16.

1326
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:54,700
Yeah.
They start making her like have like 

1327
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:54,920
phones on.
Should look now.

1328
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,280
Most likely with a collar on her neck.
That's pretty fucked up.

1329
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,200
Why don't I just put a realistic picture
of just some bones covered with come.

1330
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:19,210
Oh no fun.
It's fun reading on.

1331
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:21,620
It is.

1332
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,900
Yeah,
you can never do that in any other job 

1333
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:27,810
and be like sat back.
And we were like wow,

1334
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:30,660
I can't believe you did that,
but that's pretty fucking funny.

1335
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:31,550
You know,
you can't,

1336
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:36,640
you,
you would get in trouble if you were in 

1337
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:36,640
upper management somewhere,
you know.

1338
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,740
And he said that at a board meeting he 
suddenly passed the milk and you hold up

1339
01:00:41,911 --> 01:00:46,911
this thing.
Shouldn't this was this a fucking real 

1340
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:49,161
thing?
Imagine you shouldn't just be a pile of 

1341
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:49,161
bones and come and everybody just.

1342
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:49,161
Alright.
Alright.

1343
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:53,510
Here an advertising guy.
The poster that my father is quite a 

1344
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:56,560
successful business type guy.
I don't,

1345
01:00:56,561 --> 01:01:00,820
I couldn't tell you quite what he does,
but he was entertaining clients on a,

1346
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:01,890
on a,
on a boat.

1347
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:04,040
Trying to,
yeah,

1348
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,680
right.
Very similar.

1349
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:08,850
So he was at a dining clients that are 
like the people,

1350
01:01:08,851 --> 01:01:13,851
he was trying to get money out of it.
You developed shopping centers and 

1351
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:13,851
stuff.
Right.

1352
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:17,030
So he had this boat and this was years 
early on in my career and I had like a 

1353
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:20,871
CD,
the first CD and my brother just had it 

1354
01:01:20,871 --> 01:01:20,871
and he goes,
ah,

1355
01:01:20,871 --> 01:01:24,890
everyone wasn't really getting along,
so I thought I'd put your cd on and see 

1356
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:25,920
if we could pick the mood up or the 
group.

1357
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:27,630
And he goes,
you started with a,

1358
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:32,660
with a dance syndrome.
Jake the fucking guys kid had dancing 

1359
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:36,861
drive and we're stuck in Sydney harbor 
and we couldn't go back and he was 

1360
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:40,761
yelling at me like a fuck these deal up.
You have to put my cd on.

1361
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:43,950
No one option to put it on that much of 
a story.

1362
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,660
It's what we got,
what we got and we got to work with it.

1363
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:52,790
So I guess this is actually kind of 
disputed,

1364
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:56,120
this multiple personality disorder.
Some people think it's bullshit,

1365
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,920
but a lot of people think it's legit,

1366
01:01:57,930 --> 01:01:59,570
you know,
that's the one person doing that.

1367
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:05,720
Maybe they're all typing in.
None of the different personalities.

1368
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:06,730
This is bullshit.
I don't remember.

1369
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:11,900
I think Hershel Walker thought it was 
trauma induced from the years of 

1370
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,030
football,
which is totally crazy.

1371
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,470
Now he's fighting,
you know,

1372
01:02:13,471 --> 01:02:14,220
it's like,
wow,

1373
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:19,280
look what you're saying that he'd punch 
drunk and that's not necessarily punch 

1374
01:02:19,941 --> 01:02:20,460
drunk.

1375
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:21,920
I mean there's,
I mean,

1376
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,190
he,
he talks fine.

1377
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:28,370
He seems to think fine too,
but there are a lot of people believe 

1378
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:32,630
that you could get a lot of things wrong
with your brain from repeated trauma and

1379
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:37,080
the kind of trouble they haven't.
Football is like,

1380
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:38,790
man,
these guys are running at each other and

1381
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:42,330
clashing heads and shit and had to 
fucking knees.

1382
01:02:42,331 --> 01:02:47,331
And that's,
there's some serious impact that these 

1383
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:48,840
guys are withstanding and a lot of them 
get fucked up because of it.

1384
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:51,840
I'm pretty sure that's what he was 
saying was that it was a trauma related,

1385
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,930
um,
multiple personality disorder.

1386
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:58,600
That's just la,
that people still go,

1387
01:02:58,601 --> 01:02:59,800
oh,
we're not sure.

1388
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,880
Oh,
you sure that.

1389
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,140
Sure,
that if they're not sure,

1390
01:03:02,141 --> 01:03:04,000
they're silly,
but it's the same as Richard.

1391
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,730
Okay.
Richard Pryor and Dudley Moore both took

1392
01:03:06,731 --> 01:03:10,420
a lot of cocaine in their days and then 
they had the same,

1393
01:03:10,421 --> 01:03:12,880
this extraordinarily rare nerve 
disorder.

1394
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:15,910
It wasn't just Parkinson's.
It was like a ribbed strain of it,

1395
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,440
and then people still go,
oh,

1396
01:03:17,441 --> 01:03:19,690
we don't quite know how this happened,
and it's like,

1397
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,920
I think.
I think I know.

1398
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:26,170
Yeah.
I know another person who did the exact 

1399
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:26,170
same thing and it has the exact same 
problem.

1400
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:26,750
Yeah,
it's that.

1401
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,790
It's super,
super common.

1402
01:03:28,791 --> 01:03:29,060
Mad.

1403
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:30,170
Well,
definitely more kept,

1404
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:35,230
kept sacred for years and everyone,
because they thought he was just a 

1405
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:35,230
drunk,
but he,

1406
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:36,680
he,
he was then given up acting and thing.

1407
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:40,550
He used to go out of the concert pianist
because he was a really good pianist and

1408
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:41,350
he.
Yeah,

1409
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:47,640
he used to get halfway to get halfway 
through a song and then just sort of the

1410
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:50,360
other microphone.
Everyone was drunk again.

1411
01:03:50,361 --> 01:03:52,640
He wasn't drunk.
He was just fucking heavily diseased.

1412
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:57,940
Wow.
The last three or four years of his 

1413
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:57,940
group,
no one knew.

1414
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,510
Wow.
That's incredible.

1415
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,520
That's incredible.
Yeah.

1416
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,760
That's a good show.
Good show.

1417
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:08,500
Was it back in the day?
Would you buy a DVD?

1418
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:11,400
Would probably be awesome if it came out
at best buy if you want to best buy.

1419
01:04:11,401 --> 01:04:13,700
And so that's incredible.
DVD Collection.

1420
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,760
It depends on what it was.
I would buy it just to see what a time 

1421
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,420
traveling device it would be.
I brought the greatest American hero and

1422
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:25,460
I got the greatest American hero and 
Netflix the other day because I just 

1423
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:26,840
liked it so much as a kid and I now I 
watched it.

1424
01:04:26,841 --> 01:04:28,810
I just liked the theme song.
Is it?

1425
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,410
Is it like that?
Because I remember as a kid,

1426
01:04:30,411 --> 01:04:31,340
I really loved that.
Yeah.

1427
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:36,350
So the flying is so stupid.
That noise is so stupid that I can't 

1428
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:41,580
believe I was ever fooled or ever made

1429
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:47,200
time travel.
You can go back and see what amused you 

1430
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:47,630
when you were a little and be baffled.

1431
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:53,320
Well this is the whole theory on why 
kids should not should see gentle porn 

1432
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,370
because gentle.
You know what I mean?

1433
01:04:55,371 --> 01:05:00,371
Because I grew up with like finding a 
playboy magazine and then just batting 

1434
01:05:00,371 --> 01:05:02,120
off to it until I found another magazine
that was,

1435
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:07,150
you know,
kids today are going straight to the 

1436
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:07,150
Internet.
They're going to be fun.

1437
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,500
You guys find their magazines in the 
woods?

1438
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:09,520
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

1439
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:12,100
yeah.
In the bush.

1440
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:17,870
That incredible.
And I always used to think that some 

1441
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:17,890
adults hidden it,
but I looked back at it.

1442
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:21,920
Now there's some other kid hit it there 
and the board of the simulation program,

1443
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,640
that one,
it's almost like he grew there.

1444
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,770
You're supposed to find it.
I it to that environment.

1445
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,710
I remember mentioning show you young.
I was about seven years old,

1446
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:34,360
seven and I found these pitching when my
mother was the only woman in the house.

1447
01:05:34,361 --> 01:05:39,361
I went through one of her magazines,
so we didn't have underwear catalog 

1448
01:05:39,361 --> 01:05:42,331
sitting around like a Victoria secret 
catalog or something like that would 

1449
01:05:42,331 --> 01:05:44,641
have been good.
But we're a family picture in my mum's 

1450
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:45,490
Women's magazine.
It was just a naked.

1451
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:48,670
And these magazine never had a naked 
titone it before.

1452
01:05:48,671 --> 01:05:50,890
Right.
So I cut this picture.

1453
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:56,660
This picture,
I masturbated to these picture from 

1454
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,660
about seven till 10,
like one test is one tip.

1455
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,760
Right.
And I found out at 10 because I was 

1456
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,341
watching the news,
it was a picture of a woman having a 

1457
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:05,341
mammogram.
Whoa.

1458
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:06,940
Yeah.
But I didn't know as a kid and I used to

1459
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:09,880
think because the other tick was in a 
machine being squeezed out.

1460
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:10,580
Oh.
It was like,

1461
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:13,090
I was like,
that must be some sex machine.

1462
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,360
It's amazing.
I kept your interest for so long.

1463
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:22,250
I still do the laundry or anything at 
the sears catalog for my friends,

1464
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,630
my mom's sears catalog.
And I used to keep it and put it in mind

1465
01:06:25,631 --> 01:06:30,631
like books and like hide it in a book 
and they pull it out and look at it and 

1466
01:06:30,631 --> 01:06:33,330
masturbate and shit.
I remember being with the laundry in the

1467
01:06:33,331 --> 01:06:34,460
catalogs,
the old catalogs.

1468
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,550
We used to have catalogs.

1469
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,990
I remember there being a youtube video 
and then when I went to university and I

1470
01:06:39,991 --> 01:06:43,560
was like 22 or something like that.
Um,

1471
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:48,980
they used to keep on sending me the 
catalogs because I bought a couple of 

1472
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,410
videos years ago and I used to keep them
and they were this,

1473
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,720
they were just like pictures of scenes 
from the movie they were trying.

1474
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:57,750
I never bought anything but the catalogs
once a month.

1475
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,280
That was a big day free and I was broke,
you know,

1476
01:07:01,281 --> 01:07:06,281
I was fucking happy that I always used 
to keep my roommate one catalog behind 

1477
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:09,570
so he would get the new months one after
I got my new man.

1478
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:15,930
It's funny that what you would want then
to see naked girls to look at naked 

1479
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:16,610
girls,
that people would deny that if you,

1480
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:18,290
they say you're not ready for that.
Yeah,

1481
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,900
I mean that's what it's all about.
It's about protecting kids.

1482
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:26,030
But clearly you have these sexual urges 
and everyone's just in denial about it.

1483
01:07:26,031 --> 01:07:27,650
Nope.
You're only 16.

1484
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:32,860
You can't buy a playboy.
Like you can't even buy a playboy when 

1485
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:36,341
you're 16.
You can't even just let me see a little 

1486
01:07:36,341 --> 01:07:36,341
titty.
I don't even need to see a vagina.

1487
01:07:36,341 --> 01:07:36,341
Can I just see a lag?

1488
01:07:36,341 --> 01:07:41,100
But they,
they put it in movie movies when you're 

1489
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:41,100
16 weeks.
I've got to commend Britain.

1490
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,160
I'm on page three of the units,

1491
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:44,680
papers.
There's a topless go.

1492
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:46,360
Yeah,
that's normal.

1493
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:50,450
That's good.
What 16 year olds can't go to the movies

1494
01:07:50,451 --> 01:07:54,260
that show tits.
Tits is not talking about poor keys as a

1495
01:07:54,261 --> 01:07:57,270
bit of fitness is important as our 
wouldn't porky's.

1496
01:07:57,430 --> 01:08:00,040
I think back then it was,
well we're going to strike him,

1497
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,330
which is 16.
And he had.

1498
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,410
Maybe that is all right.
Yeah,

1499
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,840
sure.
Is that what it is?

1500
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:08,210
Yeah,
but we have our as well,

1501
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:11,290
but mature was six days.
I was 18.

1502
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:11,450
Shane

1503
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,920
does a 17 I think is our,
isn't it?

1504
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:19,070
It and NC 17 is for you.
No matter what.

1505
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,160
You can't even go with an adult unless 
you're 17.

1506
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:26,240
My Dad,
my father is so deprived of being able 

1507
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,060
to say tits out because my mom is such a
big,

1508
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,610
hefty woman in and he just,
he just,

1509
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,020
he's still like a horny sort of like my 
dad said when we were kids,

1510
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:37,110
if me and my two brothers were sitting 
watching the movie labyrinth,

1511
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:42,280
we,
you're watching like a very innocent 

1512
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:42,450
puppet related film all at once during 
the family.

1513
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:43,740
He'd be in the house.
We don't go,

1514
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:47,640
oh,
look at those tits Wa.

1515
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Within seconds my dad would just 
casually walk out and sit and watch the 

1516
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,950
rest of the film with going to go,
what are you,

1517
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,960
what are you watching?
Go all the way through the film and then

1518
01:09:01,301 --> 01:09:02,660
you go,
oh,

1519
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,230
I'm almost at the beginning of that 
film.

1520
01:09:05,231 --> 01:09:05,940
I missed what happened.

1521
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:12,500
Trolled him.
You,

1522
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,340
oh,
that's hilarious.

1523
01:09:14,341 --> 01:09:19,341
And you let them sit through the whole 
movie so we don't go and fight and then 

1524
01:09:19,341 --> 01:09:20,610
he'd have to sit through the first 30 
minutes again.

1525
01:09:20,611 --> 01:09:21,240
Like,
oh,

1526
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,420
that's fucking funny.
Just in the high,

1527
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:25,110
because it was icon.
It's got to happen.

1528
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:30,460
You guys should've filmed that.
That would make a hilarious short film 

1529
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:34,280
is explain it and now they were the time
code search and he could still do it.

1530
01:09:35,281 --> 01:09:36,650
Now.
You should do.

1531
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:39,600
I could see it.
I get it's filmed.

1532
01:09:39,601 --> 01:09:42,260
The light of the TV is what's on Ham,
right?

1533
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:44,550
Little time code and the bottom.
Show him.

1534
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:46,800
Ten minutes later,
20 minutes later,

1535
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:48,260
30 minutes later.
Look at us.

1536
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:53,340
What areas could be hilarious if you 
explain it to the camera?

1537
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,320
He found he found some porn magazines.
I never retained on this,

1538
01:09:58,321 --> 01:10:01,280
but he found some porn magazines.
I know my mother fans a porn magazine is

1539
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:05,460
out of my bed and she put them in the 
bin because that's like,

1540
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,630
I don't know,
you know,

1541
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,270
you put them in the bank and then she 
didn't say anything to me.

1542
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:12,540
She just let me off Scot free on it.
She didn't like get angry or anything,

1543
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,510
so I felt like I got away with my porn 
drawer was empty.

1544
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:20,750
Right.
And I worked in a news agency so I used 

1545
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:20,750
to collect them from the bins out the 
back of the news agencies.

1546
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,410
I had piles and piles of them.
I was a paper boy,

1547
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
right.
So I,

1548
01:10:24,001 --> 01:10:24,660
I,
uh,

1549
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,780
I was in my dad's work bench and I was 
hammering a nail down.

1550
01:10:27,781 --> 01:10:30,360
I look under the bench and there's all 
my porn magazines,

1551
01:10:30,361 --> 01:10:35,361
but they're all dogeared and they're 
like lettuce leaf on them and stuff 

1552
01:10:35,361 --> 01:10:37,190
because what happened was my dad's got 
to take,

1553
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,800
he's got to take the bend to the end of 
the driveway on a Wednesday.

1554
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:43,470
He opened the garbage bin,
solar porn.

1555
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,940
He recovered at all.

1556
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,980
I took it off to a shade,
very good vegetables.

1557
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:56,080
So I collected it all back off and I 
took it back to my drawer just because 

1558
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,650
you know,
the circle of life,

1559
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:58,520
right.

1560
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,420
And uh,
my dad comes home in the living room,

1561
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:03,400
he comes out and goes,
Jim,

1562
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,110
you guys were you in my garage?
And I said,

1563
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:07,190
alright,
I got it.

1564
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:08,120
Yay.
You guys,

1565
01:11:08,121 --> 01:11:11,600
you know,
have those magazines and I wait neither.

1566
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:11,680
Yeah,

1567
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:14,070
that was about

1568
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,460
$13.
I just said neither you anyway.

1569
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:22,360
Oh,
can I have for actual moment where I 

1570
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,710
start with my dad and I had a debate,
but I was 13 over.

1571
01:11:27,711 --> 01:11:28,890
All right.
You can have a hassle,

1572
01:11:28,891 --> 01:11:30,240
a pain.
Taos,

1573
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:35,770
a playboy geezer phone smelt morphing is
your phone right?

1574
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:42,020
You can't leave your phone by the thing.
How many times do we have to tell you 

1575
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:42,570
that crazy?
Zap,

1576
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:47,760
Zap airplanes crash.
Men can't leave that shit right by the 

1577
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:49,640
MP three player.
Were you getting texts?

1578
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,470
Would you rather kiss Nancy Reagan on 
the lips or the tit?

1579
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,020
Um,
how,

1580
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,980
how old is she right now?
Oh,

1581
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:56,670
tit,
definitely.

1582
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,610
No Lips,
lips,

1583
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:59,850
lips.
I don't want to suck on an old lady.

1584
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:01,170
Kitty,
like a really old,

1585
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,870
like I was 89 or something.
I don't know.

1586
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:06,600
But you can either say you kissed her on
the Uber and Lyft.

1587
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:08,340
No,
not tell anybody.

1588
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:12,030
She brushed it to yourself.
I'd get a respectful kiss on the mouth.

1589
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

1590
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:14,140
Nice.
Well,

1591
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,650
you look very nice today.
Nancy or would also.

1592
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:18,210
Sorry,
your husband's date.

1593
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:19,450
I started,
uh,

1594
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,540
uh,
tweeted the Deepak Chopra today.

1595
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:24,510
I rarely do,
but sometimes that dude's shit.

1596
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:26,780
That's so ridiculous.
I want to tweet back to him.

1597
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,430
He goes,
when you reach pure awareness,

1598
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:32,670
you will have no problems.
Therefore,

1599
01:12:32,671 --> 01:12:36,780
there will be no need for solutions and 
I wrote back,

1600
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:40,800
if you reach pure awareness and someone 
kicks you in the balls,

1601
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,220
you still have problems.
That is true and that's a fact.

1602
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:48,400
You can put shit like that on twitter.
Someone's gonna want to you Bob Tupa,

1603
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:50,820
Deepak show pro bro.
How dare you?

1604
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:54,000
Lots of free time.
Do some Indian dude,

1605
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,140
some girl.
Take care.

1606
01:12:55,141 --> 01:12:56,850
See,
that's exactly exactly what you say.

1607
01:12:56,851 --> 01:13:01,770
So you can reach pure awareness,
but your wife still has cancer.

1608
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:04,320
Say you know what I mean?
But you can be completely aware of it,

1609
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:05,850
but that doesn't mean the problem's 
gone.

1610
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,550
Well,
he's saying you have no problems.

1611
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:10,620
Yeah,
I say he's full of Shit.

1612
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,230
Pure awareness.
You will have no problems.

1613
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:16,200
That shit's ridiculous.
You can't just do what you want to do.

1614
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:21,230
You have to take care of things that are
going you fucking roof as a whole and I 

1615
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:21,230
guess what?
I bet you got a problem.

1616
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:21,810
I don't give a fuck what you're telling 
me.

1617
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:23,280
That's a problem.
You got to get that shit fixed.

1618
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:26,640
Not being aware of.
It's actually makes the problem worse.

1619
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:27,750
She's doing nothing.
Well,

1620
01:13:27,751 --> 01:13:29,460
I will meditate under the dripping 
water.

1621
01:13:29,461 --> 01:13:31,680
Fuck you go get that shit fixed.
You ruin your house,

1622
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:33,950
dummy.
You got a problem facing deep rock.

1623
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:35,640
You're talking nonsense.
God dammit.

1624
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:40,820
That's the problem I have with all these
dudes to talk a lot of hippie nonsense 

1625
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:44,310
that they say a lot of shit that they 
think that women who just hit menopause 

1626
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:48,321
want to hear when they really start 
getting into yoga and just try to find 

1627
01:13:48,321 --> 01:13:52,791
the light and try to find happiness and 
get into flowers raising flowers.

1628
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:56,400
That's when he comes in and kind of like
that can just swoop in on that.

1629
01:13:56,401 --> 01:14:00,840
I want to be happy market and just start
ping pong and it back and forth with all

1630
01:14:00,841 --> 01:14:03,990
these nonsense sentences.
When you reach pure awareness,

1631
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:05,220
you'll have no problems.
Bitch,

1632
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:08,850
stop with that and follow that guy.
No,

1633
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,350
I will not want to.
I want to hear more craziness

1634
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,650
is a really funny moment on youtube 
where he got,

1635
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:15,760
uh,
some,

1636
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:19,540
some guy who's writing a physics book 
with Stephen Hawkings,

1637
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,210
like it was correcting things.
He was saying the guy was like,

1638
01:14:23,211 --> 01:14:23,560
like,
you're,

1639
01:14:23,561 --> 01:14:28,561
you're,
you're saying like you're saying things 

1640
01:14:28,561 --> 01:14:28,780
that don't make sense to me.
Correcting Stephen Hawkings?

1641
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,320
No,
no,

1642
01:14:29,321 --> 01:14:29,480
no,
no,

1643
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:34,490
no.
The Guy who was writing a book with 

1644
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:37,620
Deepak Chopra was trying to explain 
something to him like quantum distant 

1645
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,190
quantum that,
and so the guy goes,

1646
01:14:39,191 --> 01:14:41,290
yeah,
I know what all those words mean,

1647
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:46,740
but I'm not quite sure what you're 
saying because he's not really saying 

1648
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:46,740
anything.
He just fucking minded,

1649
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,520
didn't it?
The infinite.

1650
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:53,580
The impossible.
The consciousness of the quantum 

1651
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:53,580
consciousness.
He just,

1652
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:57,690
he could just say things like that and 
you just leave it up to what was gassing

1653
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,400
up some sort of a broad sense.
He might've made a sentence there.

1654
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,430
There might be some point that he has 
that I can't quite grasp,

1655
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:08,080
but much more likely.
It's word salad that's designed to sound

1656
01:15:08,081 --> 01:15:10,330
spiritual with salad.
So what it is,

1657
01:15:10,331 --> 01:15:14,410
he threw a bunch of cool words together 
and this guy called them on it.

1658
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:19,440
This guy was like,
it was so brilliant the way the guy 

1659
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:19,440
said,
yeah,

1660
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,291
I know what all those words mean.
I'm not making that up the way that guy 

1661
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:22,840
talks.
You guys don't know who he is,

1662
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:28,370
who he is.
Do you know he was killed by a Tupac or 

1663
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:28,420
Biggie?
Biggie.

1664
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:30,000
Biggie killed the biggie.
Canada.

1665
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:35,220
Why did I go to work?
Better insight to really shouldn't night

1666
01:15:37,091 --> 01:15:38,020
anyway.
Both of them.

1667
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:39,070
Supposedly.
That's fine.

1668
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:45,620
It's going to happen in two hours.
The Canyon Club in a Gore Hill hills,

1669
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,500
so come on down,
starts in two hours.

1670
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:51,410
It's a great place to go to the barbecue
place first.

1671
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:53,540
What time does your show there?
Seven.

1672
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:55,760
I think it's like,
is it an 8:00

1673
01:15:55,761 --> 01:15:57,280
start?
Is it all right?

1674
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,660
Well,
let's show starts when you get this on.

1675
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:04,690
Yeah,
that's one of my favorite comics and UK 

1676
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:05,300
can.
I didn't call and Tom Stage checking him

1677
01:16:05,301 --> 01:16:05,990
out.
Really,

1678
01:16:05,991 --> 01:16:08,330
really fucking funny guy.
He's opening for you.

1679
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:08,800
No,
no,

1680
01:16:08,801 --> 01:16:09,050
no,
no,

1681
01:16:09,051 --> 01:16:09,830
no.
He's just a guy.

1682
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:14,831
He still lives in Britain,
but he said was when I in when I was a 

1683
01:16:14,831 --> 01:16:15,970
young comic and I was in a car with him.
We're going to a gig and I said,

1684
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:18,470
fuck,
we're going to make for the Gig.

1685
01:16:18,471 --> 01:16:20,390
And he went,
we are the Gig.

1686
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:23,930
So that's Dr.
Yeah,

1687
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:26,570
that's what it's up.
Yeah.

1688
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:31,580
We,
I've been many times where we were 

1689
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,471
really close to being late for shows.
Ari in particular would get very 

1690
01:16:33,471 --> 01:16:34,380
nervous.
Donkin donkey would have to open.

1691
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:37,560
Fuck man,
I kinda just just drop me off in front.

1692
01:16:37,561 --> 01:16:40,390
Don't even park.
I'm like eight.

1693
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:43,200
Oh five were good shows.
Five minutes.

1694
01:16:43,201 --> 01:16:45,780
Like who gives a fuck if they,
if they're really mad,

1695
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:46,860
like with your audience.
Gonna be mad.

1696
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,550
What kind of asshole would be upset or 
to show starting five minutes late.

1697
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,700
I'd tell you what.
I went and sold.

1698
01:16:53,701 --> 01:16:54,500
So Billy Joel

1699
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,850
in concert,
which is how all good stories start.

1700
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:02,810
I mean,
so billy billy Joel in concert in 

1701
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:03,930
Sheffield in the north of England and I 
was in the third row.

1702
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:09,540
I got the tickets rather light,
but I don't think he's popular in 

1703
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:09,540
Sheffield.
Anyway.

1704
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:12,380
So,
so this woman looks at her watch and she

1705
01:17:12,381 --> 01:17:15,410
sit next to her husband and she's just 
got the shit right.

1706
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:17,930
It's like 10 past eight shows meant to 
start at eight.

1707
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,420
And she went,
this is fucking bullshit.

1708
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,470
Right?
And the husband's gone,

1709
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,430
hey,
don't worry,

1710
01:17:22,431 --> 01:17:23,750
it'll be fine.
And she said,

1711
01:17:23,751 --> 01:17:28,751
no,
we got here on time it he should get 

1712
01:17:28,751 --> 01:17:29,320
here on time as well.
And we thought,

1713
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:31,370
well maybe they're missing a frame,
right?

1714
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,430
She goes over and speaks to security.
Goggin.

1715
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,690
Wednesday's going to start with 10,
five slash 10 minutes late.

1716
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:39,920
The security guys just like fuck off 
because he doesn't care.

1717
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:43,790
You know what I mean?
And then billy Joel comes out 15 minutes

1718
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:45,230
late probably,
right?

1719
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:50,500
Which is normal time and billy Joel 
comes out and then the whole audience 

1720
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,010
stands up and she just sits there and 
yells out.

1721
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:57,070
I paid for a seat and then that husband 
was just dragged away and I still think 

1722
01:17:57,261 --> 01:17:59,330
to this day that's the biggest can't 
I've ever seen.

1723
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:01,430
And I've only seen about five sentences 
for that.

1724
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:04,490
I felt like grabbing that guy can just 
get out of this leave,

1725
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,710
Ryan,
you don't need this woman anymore.

1726
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:09,140
She's horrible.
That's the worst you've ever seen.

1727
01:18:09,141 --> 01:18:10,130
Really.
It was that bad.

1728
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:15,390
It just,
just in just a short amount of time 

1729
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:15,390
where I thought,
this person's just evil,

1730
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,000
horrible.
Some people don't ever realize how tall 

1731
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:21,000
building,
but I would think that after shows,

1732
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:21,610
you see a lot of those,
right?

1733
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:22,180
Yeah.

1734
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:24,320
You do photos after gigs to you?
Sure.

1735
01:18:24,321 --> 01:18:24,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

1736
01:18:24,681 --> 01:18:28,460
You ever get that person who just wants 
to like headlock you or something?

1737
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:31,050
A guy asked me if he carried me.
Yeah,

1738
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,540
I've heard that one.
Can I hold,

1739
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:37,541
you know,
guys are always asking to choke me 

1740
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:38,950
because a lot of Jujitsu guys shows 
like,

1741
01:18:38,951 --> 01:18:41,780
can I get you in a room naked?
But I don't trust anybody.

1742
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,980
You can't just get my back like that.
So no,

1743
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:46,750
I,
I,

1744
01:18:46,751 --> 01:18:50,310
uh,
I don't get that as much does.

1745
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:55,350
We'll ask all sorts of weird shit.
One guy asked me to bend over in front 

1746
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,030
of them in Louisville.
He goes,

1747
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:58,250
will you bend over front?
And I'll make it like I'm spanking you.

1748
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,060
I go,
what?

1749
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:00,710
He goes,
I'm going to be behind you.

1750
01:19:00,711 --> 01:19:02,660
You're going to bend over and make a 
killing on spanking you.

1751
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:07,980
I go,
you really think that anybody would say 

1752
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:07,980
yes to that?

1753
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:07,980
Any person you don't know,
say,

1754
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,220
yeah,
go ahead and you'll,

1755
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,300
I'll bend over like you're having sex 
with me.

1756
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,890
Like that kind of bend over.
Oh yeah,

1757
01:19:12,891 --> 01:19:13,580
yeah.
Please.

1758
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:18,850
How many times have you taken a photo 
with a person after a Gig and you put 

1759
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:22,060
your,
the arm around and the smile and the 

1760
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,860
point to the face.
Maybe I've got a few poses a serious one

1761
01:19:23,861 --> 01:19:25,330
that happened.
Right?

1762
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:30,340
So how many times have you like put your
arm around a couple of girls and then 

1763
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:32,810
one of them just grabs your cock riots 
happened?

1764
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:33,210
Yeah.
Yeah,

1765
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:38,260
they just grab your cock and like just 
sort of the fun of it happens because 

1766
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:38,260
honk on it like that because I don't 
have to go further.

1767
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:41,000
And you sort of get her.
Yeah.

1768
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:42,460
You know what I mean?
Like it is like,

1769
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,880
thanks for that.
But imagine if a male did that to a 

1770
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,260
female act.
Just grabbed the tip.

1771
01:19:48,261 --> 01:19:51,520
Just grab her pussy.
Yeah,

1772
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:52,000
yeah,
yeah,

1773
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:53,380
yeah.
Just went bang finger.

1774
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:56,570
It would be like grabbing a guy's ass.
There'll be the same.

1775
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,820
No,
no grabbing it goes out.

1776
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,230
It's like grabbing a guy's ass.
Yeah,

1777
01:20:00,231 --> 01:20:01,700
I think if a girl grabs my dick,
I'm ready,

1778
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,010
I'll automatically start fingering her 
pussy.

1779
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:08,190
Women that have this confidence and 
normally

1780
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:11,170
like a big jersey check we'd like for,
you know,

1781
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:12,590
these aren't,
you know,

1782
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,510
where you're like,
Ooh,

1783
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:18,590
I always feel that grabbing a girl's ass
is way worse than a girl grabbing a guys

1784
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:21,390
asked because it's not like she can rape
you.

1785
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:25,440
A guy grabbed because I'm not a good 
father.

1786
01:20:25,441 --> 01:20:28,410
You're a good fighter.
You think a lot of girls can rape you?

1787
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,190
Oh yeah.
Monday,

1788
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:36,100
plenty times happened several times.
I almost got raped last night.

1789
01:20:36,601 --> 01:20:37,820
Actually.
How dare you know,

1790
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,330
I swear to God,
stopped down.

1791
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,850
There was this girl that left the comedy
store.

1792
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:43,380
Everyone.
There's tons of witnesses or this,

1793
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:48,560
uh,
she comes up to me and she's talking to 

1794
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:48,560
me and she goes,
oh,

1795
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:48,560
you're a bartender too?
And I'm like,

1796
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:48,560
no,
I'm a bartender.

1797
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,840
And then.
So she did,

1798
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:53,690
she did a shot though and then she just 
fucking comes in and tries to kiss me.

1799
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,190
I'm like,
Whoa,

1800
01:20:54,191 --> 01:20:54,480
Whoa,
Whoa,

1801
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:55,290
what the fuck?
And she's like,

1802
01:20:55,291 --> 01:20:57,600
I just got out of Rehab three days ago.
Uh,

1803
01:20:57,601 --> 01:21:02,601
you know,
I'm not supposed to be drinking right 

1804
01:21:02,601 --> 01:21:04,911
now.
I was raped when I was a kid and just 

1805
01:21:04,911 --> 01:21:04,911
started going off on like a million 
things.

1806
01:21:04,911 --> 01:21:07,920
Now you're hooked.
So three days out of Rehab,

1807
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:10,170
she's already drunk again.
She and your favorites yet?

1808
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,300
No,
I,

1809
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:12,240
I hid.
I was like,

1810
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:15,070
I have to go to the bathroom and I ran 
in the green room.

1811
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:20,120
Main Room.
I'm still creeped out by as American 

1812
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:20,160
voice.
So I was thinking I was like,

1813
01:21:20,161 --> 01:21:21,770
this store is not going to have any 
punch line.

1814
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,850
You're not going to pay this off.
She's not going to rape you.

1815
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:24,730
She didn't rape you,
man.

1816
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:26,580
Some rape you at all?
No.

1817
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:29,580
She tried to impose you.
Did was give you a kiss?

1818
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:30,000
No,
no.

1819
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:31,680
The whole time she was like trying to 
like,

1820
01:21:31,681 --> 01:21:32,130
grab,
you know,

1821
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,020
it's sexy isn't ripe is right.
Is it?

1822
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,580
Yeah.
It's more than kissing.

1823
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:38,790
She's not trying to throw me on my grind
raving,

1824
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:43,180
but there's definitely a difference 
between rape so easily.

1825
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:45,570
I'm not saying real rape diet.
Right.

1826
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,750
I just think it's way creepy.
Want to do grabs a girl's ass.

1827
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,620
It's physical.

1828
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:55,080
And you can't do anything about it.
And if I wanted to rape you,

1829
01:21:55,081 --> 01:21:57,030
I probably could get away with it if 
there was nobody around.

1830
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:59,850
That's what a guy saying when he grabs a
through a mind,

1831
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:04,900
if I've ever like pinched to go,
that I haven't known quite wells asked 

1832
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,430
as they walked by.
I think if you're a person and you're,

1833
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:07,380
you know,
you're like,

1834
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:12,440
you don't even know this other person 
and you just reach over and grab a girl 

1835
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,540
and squeeze it like that.
That's like a big violation.

1836
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:17,650
That's like a big violation of space,
man.

1837
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:22,770
Man.
Just tell us your sister or your 

1838
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:24,471
daughter.
Imagine if you watched someone do that 

1839
01:22:24,471 --> 01:22:24,471
to your daughter.
Reach over and grab your daughter's ass.

1840
01:22:24,471 --> 01:22:26,460
That's what it.
Wow fucking violation.

1841
01:22:26,461 --> 01:22:27,810
That is.
And you know,

1842
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:31,380
because to you it's not a guy's daughter
at some hot 20 year old,

1843
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,840
but meanwhile behind her is her fucking 
dad.

1844
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,700
And you reach over and grab her ass.
That shit happens.

1845
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:37,860
That's a creepy moment for people,
man.

1846
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:39,570
When you realize what,
what it is,

1847
01:22:39,571 --> 01:22:42,180
when somebody just reaches over and 
grabs you when you don't know them.

1848
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,400
I don't have a daughter right now that's
kind of high.

1849
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:47,190
If I imagined my sister or my daughter 
being really hot,

1850
01:22:47,191 --> 01:22:52,191
some guy just grabbing it.
Slips have a child data.

1851
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:54,640
So you can imagine grabbing my 
daughter's fine.

1852
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:56,560
Just whatever she wanted to look like.
I'm fine.

1853
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:59,160
It was this imaginary Brian,
my daughter,

1854
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:05,810
my daughter and your daughter now.
It closed down twice.

1855
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:14,430
One day.
Her daughters are antigovernment talk 

1856
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:15,300
had to fill the,
uh,

1857
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:18,400
my daughter has a touch of the accent 
but not quite because he lived here,

1858
01:23:18,401 --> 01:23:23,110
but we take her on holidays.
She has a yeast infection.

1859
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:25,590
I don't want your daughter near my 
daughter

1860
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:28,420
and we're going to lose sponsors.
We're going to lose viewers.

1861
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:33,670
People are going to commit suicide.
You guys are having your artificial fake

1862
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,170
fictional daughters engage in immoral 
and illegal things.

1863
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:42,370
I do.
It is upset now and she's cutting 

1864
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:42,370
herself.
She kinda,

1865
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:45,130
I can't have that on my podcast.
She's a cottage.

1866
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:45,780
He's not happy.

1867
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,100
What is God?
When did that start?

1868
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:51,130
When did cutting started?

1869
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,330
Well,
but it's always,

1870
01:23:53,331 --> 01:23:54,680
when you meet that girl,
we,

1871
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:56,290
you look at the forearms and you're 
like,

1872
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:58,970
oh,
she's going to be good in bed.

1873
01:23:58,971 --> 01:24:00,330
But yeah,

1874
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:05,690
a buddy who found these marks on a girl,
he had dated her for awhile and then he 

1875
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:07,830
like saw one of her arms was like sliced
up and he goes,

1876
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:11,010
it was a window into madness.
He said,

1877
01:24:11,011 --> 01:24:14,790
all the sudden I just went,
what the fuck is?

1878
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:17,340
He goes,
and then I realized what the fuck.

1879
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:18,300
He goes like,
and they were like,

1880
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:19,200
lions,
man,

1881
01:24:19,201 --> 01:24:20,820
I can't believe I hadn't noticed him 
before.

1882
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,200
And he goes,
and all of a sudden I was like,

1883
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:23,040
Holy Shit.

1884
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,210
I went out with go long sleeves,
long sleeves,

1885
01:24:25,211 --> 01:24:30,211
long sleeves,
and then after a few weeks and then I 

1886
01:24:30,211 --> 01:24:30,900
saw it.
And because every time you got you got,

1887
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:34,920
you had to be in the light light and it 
was just these little,

1888
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,760
like thousands of these little white 
marks.

1889
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:40,810
It doesn't.
Lindsay Lohan allegedly have do that.

1890
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:44,000
I had a friend

1891
01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:46,010
who did it,
who she told me about.

1892
01:24:46,011 --> 01:24:48,810
It was quite a successful lady now.
But um,

1893
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:52,910
and she explained it to me as you,
a,

1894
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:57,920
you're depressed,
you blame yourself and everyone is 

1895
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:57,920
telling you that you shouldn't blame 
yourself.

1896
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:58,830
You just said,
why do you,

1897
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:02,670
why do you hate yourself?
And you can never answer that question.

1898
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:04,620
But if you cut yourself,
you're like,

1899
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,660
that's why I hate myself because my fuck
up.

1900
01:25:06,661 --> 01:25:08,660
Who would do that to themselves?
Oh,

1901
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:10,740
I should hate myself.
I've just cut myself.

1902
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:13,050
Man.
It gives them the excuse to,

1903
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,760
it's so amazing to me that we spend so 
much time worrying about shit that's 

1904
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:23,441
going on overseas and these other 
countries and so little time worrying 

1905
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:28,271
about how,
how many people are just getting raised 

1906
01:25:28,271 --> 01:25:31,370
in some crazy fucked up way.
How many people are,

1907
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:36,400
you know,
completely unqualified to be having 

1908
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,401
children.
Children are suffering under the 

1909
01:25:39,401 --> 01:25:41,920
guidance and parental leadership or 
these fuckheads like someone should 

1910
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:47,500
invest some something or something,
something that has got.

1911
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:50,510
It's probably got to be done by 
everybody all at once together.

1912
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,310
There's no way like the government 
could,

1913
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,260
could fix the problem of stupidity and 
craziness and abuse in this country.

1914
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:58,770
There's no way.
I mean it,

1915
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,690
but it at least make some sort of effort
to slow it down.

1916
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,200
You know,
we will dump children.

1917
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:11,800
It's almost always something fucked up,
happens to children and then they start 

1918
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:15,491
doing shit like cutting themselves or a 
lot of other disturbing shit.

1919
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:19,850
A lot of it is related to the sexual 
abuse.

1920
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:22,220
The guy from horter said,
whenever she gets involved,

1921
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:27,610
if he goes to a house and people are 
storing their shit or or shitting and 

1922
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:30,080
diapers and leaving them piled up,
it's always sexual abuse.

1923
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:31,850
Fuck

1924
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,740
crazy man.
We gotta fix that.

1925
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:37,560
This has got to be a way to fix the 
human.

1926
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:38,730
Just fix the

1927
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:41,230
what the fuck kids is really the best 
way in it.

1928
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:46,800
The best way is you've got kids ugly.
That's bad haircuts and horrible.

1929
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:55,660
We've got to figure out a way to filter 
every human being through some sort of 

1930
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:59,451
analysis.
Something that lets you know how fucked 

1931
01:26:59,451 --> 01:26:59,451
up they are,
why,

1932
01:26:59,451 --> 01:27:03,980
you know,
if we could ever measure with like a 

1933
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:04,440
machine psychological fucked up,
you know,

1934
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:07,140
if there's a machine you could,
you could talk all the shit you want,

1935
01:27:07,141 --> 01:27:09,480
but I'm gonna send you through a machine
and the machine comes out like,

1936
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:10,170
oh no,
no,

1937
01:27:10,171 --> 01:27:10,500
no,
no,

1938
01:27:10,501 --> 01:27:12,240
no,
this guy's fucking crazy.

1939
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:14,730
That would be bad because in the 
government would use that machine.

1940
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:19,290
And so even though this talking 
radically logically and normally we know

1941
01:27:19,291 --> 01:27:21,280
in the back of his head that he's,
he's a suicide.

1942
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:26,380
They would cheat with a machine that 
would cheat just like the voting 

1943
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:27,910
machines to Fox.
I just,

1944
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:33,410
I've just bought a boat and going 
through the mortgage process I found to 

1945
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:37,651
be very stressful.
The only reason why I mentioned this 

1946
01:27:37,651 --> 01:27:38,230
because of the terrorist thing,
they asked to see.

1947
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:42,100
They sent me down because I'm not,
I'm not a citizen.

1948
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:45,640
So they asked to see what all my checks 
were deposited,

1949
01:27:45,641 --> 01:27:50,641
my big money checks that are gone in a.
What were they and why did I get the 

1950
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:50,641
checks?
Right?

1951
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:54,290
The CFI was a terrorist or at first I 
have to be an idiot to,

1952
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:59,580
but they were all like the chuckle hot 
bananas like comedy related and I was 

1953
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,480
getting that one's comedy as well.
That one's also comedy.

1954
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:05,470
Yes.
Nope.

1955
01:28:05,471 --> 01:28:07,450
That one's comedy.
Who's caroline?

1956
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:10,720
She's comedy as well.
That's Hilarious,

1957
01:28:10,721 --> 01:28:11,650
but I just didn't it.
Yeah.

1958
01:28:11,651 --> 01:28:13,420
I don't know if Americans have to do 
that,

1959
01:28:13,421 --> 01:28:17,920
but I was asked whether it was from to 
fund terrorist for.

1960
01:28:17,970 --> 01:28:19,360
Wow.
Wow.

1961
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:21,670
That's fascinating.
What's the point?

1962
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:26,700
I'd have to be the biggest fucking idiot
terrorists in the world to go go comedy 

1963
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:27,610
club comedy club now.
That one.

1964
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,910
Our Credo.
That one's a bad one.

1965
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:34,710
Like it's all comedy clubs.
Sometimes.

1966
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:36,280
Training in the mountains of Turkey.

1967
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:43,480
Yeah.
There's those training videos with the 

1968
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:43,490
dudes are running with like fucking the 
rifles over their heads.

1969
01:28:43,491 --> 01:28:47,960
They have like the traditional afghany 
outfits on really fascinating.

1970
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:48,980
Faster.
Those,

1971
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:54,030
those training footages of character,
terrorist training footages like you 

1972
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:54,920
bitches around shape,
like look at you.

1973
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:55,640
What kind of fucking.

1974
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:56,960
Oh No,
it is.

1975
01:28:56,990 --> 01:28:59,210
It is like a little league team trying 
to play the Yankees.

1976
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:00,180
Yeah,
exactly.

1977
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:05,760
We have got your bats now look at this.
They're homemade ball bat.

1978
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:09,130
We did not have a vote,
so we have got the rubber bands and what

1979
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:12,780
tape and we have got the tape over and 
over and it's commented in some Yuck.

1980
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:17,200
One of the big UFC fighters got popped 
for steroids this week.

1981
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:19,850
Not Steroids,
but um,

1982
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,420
he uh,
test Alistair Overeem,

1983
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:27,400
tested his testosterone to estrogen was 
14 to one.

1984
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:29,020
Wow.
Yeah.

1985
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:34,170
Which is normal.
A normal person is one to one and they 

1986
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:38,731
allow four to one in Nevada,
allow six to one because that used to be

1987
01:29:39,461 --> 01:29:40,820
the standard up until recently.

1988
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:43,640
I should add all of these hair falling 
out,

1989
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:48,530
but he looks like a Goddamn Superhero.
He looks like a superhero in a movie.

1990
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:53,610
Alistair Overeem,
not gay or I'm not getting anything but 

1991
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:53,610
the best.

1992
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:58,510
So you're not talking about a man.

1993
01:29:58,790 --> 01:30:03,790
Anything right now.
There's nothing sexual but what I'm 

1994
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:05,561
saying.
But he's absolutely the most 

1995
01:30:05,561 --> 01:30:06,110
unrealistically built human I've ever 
seen.

1996
01:30:06,170 --> 01:30:08,530
Like if you see her for ignite type of 
pr,

1997
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:11,360
but the perfect size,
like the guy,

1998
01:30:11,361 --> 01:30:14,270
like he's smaller than like Lou 
Ferrigno,

1999
01:30:14,271 --> 01:30:15,850
but ridiculously bad.
You see him,

2000
01:30:15,851 --> 01:30:16,430
you're like,
what?

2001
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:19,670
They call them,
Uber like ridiculous built,

2002
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,140
but he used to fight at two.
Oh,

2003
01:30:21,141 --> 01:30:22,400
five.
Used to be a much smaller,

2004
01:30:22,401 --> 01:30:27,401
much skinnier guy and he packed all this
weight and so they don't know what 

2005
01:30:27,401 --> 01:30:31,361
caused this guy to test so high,
but it's most likely that he was a 

2006
01:30:31,361 --> 01:30:33,590
supplementing his body's natural.

2007
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:37,330
I thought most of them were probably on 
some type of injection.

2008
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:39,730
I would wonder what the real numbers 
are,

2009
01:30:39,731 --> 01:30:40,690
man,
I wouldn't wonder,

2010
01:30:40,691 --> 01:30:45,691
but they're doing things like this now 
and they're going to find out they're 

2011
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:48,910
gonna.
They're gonna catch a lot of people 

2012
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:48,910
because what they're doing is they're 
doing it randomly,

2013
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:49,420
like they show up for a press 
conference.

2014
01:30:49,421 --> 01:30:51,790
No one told them they were going to be 
drug tested and then boom,

2015
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:56,970
all of a sudden the Nevada state 
athletic commission is taking samples 

2016
01:30:56,970 --> 01:30:57,250
from them,
so.

2017
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,830
So they didn't have a chance to prepare 
for it in the past.

2018
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:02,800
What they would do is they would try to 
cycle off of it,

2019
01:31:02,801 --> 01:31:07,801
but some people didn't and the people 
that didn't fucked it up for everybody 

2020
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:11,611
else because then people start testing 
positive and then people started like 

2021
01:31:11,611 --> 01:31:15,420
the assert overturning.
A few fights have been overturned 

2022
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:15,420
because of it.
It should be a reality show.

2023
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:16,270
Danish would make that like,
you know,

2024
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:17,860
were they jumping in like,
all right,

2025
01:31:17,861 --> 01:31:20,830
we're going to test you now and then 
that's a terrible idea.

2026
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:23,440
That's a terrible idea.
I don't want to see that.

2027
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:28,560
I think they're going to have to figure 
out how many people are actually doing 

2028
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:28,560
this stuff.
You know?

2029
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,560
I know for sure people have been caught 
so for sure people are doing it,

2030
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:37,590
you know,
and there's the estimations vary from 

2031
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:40,080
some people say half,
some people say almost all are doing 

2032
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:40,780
something.
Some people say it's a small percentage,

2033
01:31:40,781 --> 01:31:43,240
you know,
you would have to go fight camp to fight

2034
01:31:43,241 --> 01:31:48,241
camp and get guys on some sort of an 
anonymous poll where they were honest 

2035
01:31:48,241 --> 01:31:52,321
with you,
but knew that they weren't going to get 

2036
01:31:52,321 --> 01:31:52,321
in trouble for it.
And even then,

2037
01:31:52,321 --> 01:31:52,750
I don't think people would be smart to 
tell the truth.

2038
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:53,770
It's just,
you know,

2039
01:31:53,771 --> 01:31:54,940
there's,
there's a,

2040
01:31:55,510 --> 01:32:00,510
there's a long standing tradition in 
almost every sport where people take 

2041
01:32:01,511 --> 01:32:04,720
things that make them better.
That's a fact.

2042
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:09,870
And it's because they want to get better
at that sport and their body just can't 

2043
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:10,970
keep up the work pace.
Can't keep up the workload.

2044
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,420
You know,
you can a guy get as big as mark mcgwire

2045
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:14,860
got without steroids.
Yeah,

2046
01:32:14,861 --> 01:32:19,861
probably.
But that motherfucker better beaten ham 

2047
01:32:19,861 --> 01:32:21,310
sandwiches over 15 minutes and doing 
squats and dead lifts and,

2048
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:23,440
and he's got not gonna have a lot of 
time for baseball,

2049
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,170
you know,
that's a goddamn power lifter physique.

2050
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:31,350
And he got it by just just slamming that
needle in and pumping in that fucking 

2051
01:32:31,991 --> 01:32:36,040
Superman Jewson and that's the way you 
get good at baseball.

2052
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,650
And that,
that felt like nothing to him.

2053
01:32:38,651 --> 01:32:41,950
He got up and I was fucking massive.
When he was the home run king,

2054
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:45,400
when it was him and Sammy Sosa were 
doing back and forth,

2055
01:32:45,401 --> 01:32:47,600
both of us looked like fucking 
superheroes,

2056
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:48,070
man.

2057
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:50,890
Just giant muscles.
And they would go up and,

2058
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:56,560
and these fucking balls would go flying 
through the air into parking lots and 

2059
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:57,790
shit.
And everybody loved it,

2060
01:32:57,791 --> 01:33:02,791
but they didn't love how they did it.
And it's crazy that Mark Mcguire is the 

2061
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:03,430
only one who really kinda got off the 
hook about it.

2062
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:03,790
He,
he,

2063
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:07,630
he admitted it to get a coaching job 
like after he retired,

2064
01:33:07,631 --> 01:33:10,300
but he had shrunk down to a normal sized
person.

2065
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:15,440
This is a very bongs now.
Looks like at the beginning of his 

2066
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:15,440
career.
Yeah.

2067
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:15,730
Yeah.
He slimmed down.

2068
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:17,800
Well,
you know,

2069
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:22,801
he was probably doing a lot of crazy 
shit in order to get better as he got 

2070
01:33:22,801 --> 01:33:22,801
older.
You know,

2071
01:33:22,801 --> 01:33:27,730
that's when you're in your forties and 
you're just smashing balls are like 

2072
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:28,690
Roger Clemens was just throwing crazy.
He,

2073
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:30,130
you know,
he got better.

2074
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:35,280
It's weird.
It's weird how you can dip like you're 

2075
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:35,280
eight.

2076
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,570
It starts to show the signs of age and 
then you just charge right back up.

2077
01:33:37,870 --> 01:33:39,250
And everybody's like,
well that's terrible.

2078
01:33:39,251 --> 01:33:40,630
He's cheating.
But I'm like,

2079
01:33:40,631 --> 01:33:42,270
God damn.
It looked easy.

2080
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:47,700
It is though that there's something that
you can take that makes you better at 

2081
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:48,250
sports and isn't like being better at 
sports,

2082
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,980
isn't being more athletic,
isn't being more vibrant,

2083
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,640
a sign of being healthy,
so shouldn't only be looking at this guy

2084
01:33:54,641 --> 01:33:57,790
and go,
isn't it amazing that modern science has

2085
01:33:57,791 --> 01:34:02,791
allowed barry bonds to actually get 
better as he gets older and maybe I'll 

2086
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:06,520
allow him to take a little bit of this 
and a little bit of that as long as he's

2087
01:34:06,521 --> 01:34:09,100
not getting too crazy because look 
without that,

2088
01:34:09,101 --> 01:34:10,960
he was a very good baseball player 
anyway.

2089
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:14,170
But with that Jesus fucking Christ had 
shit.

2090
01:34:14,171 --> 01:34:18,730
Get Fun at the Ballpark at Barry.
He seems fine,

2091
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,140
you know,
I mean,

2092
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:23,530
no one's stepping in to stop,
you know,

2093
01:34:23,531 --> 01:34:25,810
uh,
Ralphie may from eating too much.

2094
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:28,040
There's no one from the government that 
stepping in and the same,

2095
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:30,310
the name of comedy and stopping him from
eating too much.

2096
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:35,820
Is Steroids comedy though?
It's a personal writer ages real.

2097
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:39,760
It doesn't.
My analogy was a terrible analogy.

2098
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:43,060
Forget it.
It didn't make sense.

2099
01:34:43,330 --> 01:34:48,330
But what I was.
What I was trying to say was that I 

2100
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:48,330
guess it does make him way better at the
sport,

2101
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:53,260
but I mean why wouldn't something that 
makes you better at a sport be legal?

2102
01:34:53,290 --> 01:34:58,290
Shouldn't it be like used properly?
It seems to me that there's a lot of 

2103
01:34:58,290 --> 01:34:58,290
people,
but as they

2104
01:34:58,290 --> 01:35:00,830
get older,
their arguments that it gives you cancer

2105
01:35:00,831 --> 01:35:01,930
or whatever,
but everything.

2106
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:07,310
What the fuck doesn't give you cancer?
They can say anything gives you cancer 

2107
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:07,310
at this point.
You know,

2108
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:08,040
I think a lot of people think cell 
phones,

2109
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:10,070
but there's no cases of it.
I don't think there's anybody's,

2110
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:12,720
a brain tumor from a cell phone.
Have you heard that?

2111
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:14,270
Rather?
I did.

2112
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:19,420
Really.
There is people who've gotten brain 

2113
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:22,181
tumors,
but they're not doctors who were saying 

2114
01:35:22,181 --> 01:35:22,181
this.
I gone on.

2115
01:35:22,181 --> 01:35:22,181
I think it's because

2116
01:35:22,181 --> 01:35:24,860
there's so much toxic shit in a.
In a person's environment,

2117
01:35:24,861 --> 01:35:28,240
it's so possible if you're not careful 
with your diet and careful with your,

2118
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,480
your health,
you know,

2119
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:31,850
if you could be in the room,
you would live someplace where you don't

2120
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:36,851
even realize it and the whole town is 
getting poisoned by some chemical leak 

2121
01:35:36,851 --> 01:35:37,640
or some shit that's happened a bunch of 
times.

2122
01:35:37,641 --> 01:35:41,720
It's real common.
It's very difficult out there.

2123
01:35:41,721 --> 01:35:42,650
Jim Jefferies.

2124
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:46,050
It's a change in this country.
It's very difficult.

2125
01:35:46,051 --> 01:35:51,051
More chemicals in the food.
Is it you find that a food taste 

2126
01:35:51,051 --> 01:35:51,051
different here than in Australia?
No,

2127
01:35:51,051 --> 01:35:55,851
I find I find it harder in this country 
you did to keep my weight off because 

2128
01:35:55,851 --> 01:35:58,450
the chemicals on it and sort of the same
amount I find.

2129
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,710
What is it different?
Like what kind of shit the most?

2130
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:04,710
I think my beef in Australia is,
is just grasp it.

2131
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:07,140
That isn't just like,
you know best for you.

2132
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:08,610
Yeah.
That isn't just an option.

2133
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:14,050
I think that's just what,
but if is in his strength and things 

2134
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:16,671
like Msg is just illegal where it's not 
every trans fats illegal.

2135
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:20,080
It's so ridiculous that that's not a 
legal drink.

2136
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:24,390
Guess what boys associate cigarettes and
you're both smokers yet mean cigarettes.

2137
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:30,480
If neither one of you could be hooked on
cigarettes would thing about Msg is 

2138
01:36:31,081 --> 01:36:34,110
different is I actually have a little 
reaction.

2139
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:36,330
I get damaged.
You feel a bit twitchy from eating it.

2140
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:41,660
I know I've been in it so I,
when I go into a Chinese restaurant now 

2141
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:42,000
I have to go.
Do you have msg?

2142
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:45,180
And they sometimes don't lie to me.
Right.

2143
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:47,960
And how do you know,
do you just feel a little bit on age?

2144
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:49,920
Just afterwards,
like my nerves are a bit,

2145
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:51,570
you know,
what is it the,

2146
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:54,980
what's the official medical I'm allergic
to?

2147
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:56,850
It's,
it's a very,

2148
01:36:56,910 --> 01:36:58,160
it's a very sort of,
you know,

2149
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:03,200
you get that like a,
like a tingly feeling in your jaw like 

2150
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:03,200
that.
What is that?

2151
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,940
That happens to me.
Um,

2152
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:11,220
but low sodium glutamate is a fucking 
tenderizer or whatever.

2153
01:37:11,221 --> 01:37:13,140
It's not fun.
It was like a flavor enhancer.

2154
01:37:13,890 --> 01:37:18,060
Mike's mate softer and my vegetables 
green.

2155
01:37:18,061 --> 01:37:20,490
Uh Huh.
You know what I mean?

2156
01:37:20,491 --> 01:37:23,050
It gives it color and mates.
But anyway,

2157
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:28,051
it's illegal and was about trans fats 
are illegal in the rest of these are 

2158
01:37:28,051 --> 01:37:28,440
things you just don't fucking need.

2159
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:33,520
Well,
we have a real problem in this country 

2160
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,930
where the giant corporations have 
essentially completely bypassed the 

2161
01:37:36,381 --> 01:37:39,350
whole system of government and just 
control politicians.

2162
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:42,110
I mean they just essentially just buying
people out.

2163
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:45,260
And that's what's been done in this 
country for the last few debt problem.

2164
01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:46,130
You know,
who knows?

2165
01:37:46,131 --> 01:37:48,680
The argument is forever.
But the point is right now,

2166
01:37:48,681 --> 01:37:53,681
the way things stand today,
there's a lot of shit that's bad for 

2167
01:37:53,681 --> 01:37:53,681
you.
That's legal.

2168
01:37:53,681 --> 01:37:57,041
There's a lot of shit.
There's a lot of God damn pain killers 

2169
01:37:57,041 --> 01:37:59,381
that are fucking terribly addictive.
And they were passing them out like 

2170
01:37:59,381 --> 01:38:02,751
cookies.
There's a lot of shit in this country 

2171
01:38:02,751 --> 01:38:02,751
that's fucked up.
It's,

2172
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:04,600
you know,
it's a,

2173
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:10,980
it's a big message.
And how know fucking fix this.

2174
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:12,900
You know,
what'd you do?

2175
01:38:12,901 --> 01:38:14,460
Jim?
Jefferies as an outsider,

2176
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:18,530
why would I do what to fix America?
Yeah.

2177
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:20,250
Oh,
I bring in healthcare.

2178
01:38:20,290 --> 01:38:22,680
I'm a big believer in healthcare and 
healthcare will do it.

2179
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:26,920
Healthcare,
I believe is essential in a,

2180
01:38:26,921 --> 01:38:28,570
in a,
in a modern society.

2181
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:33,580
I can't listen to anymore.
I've lived in Britain whether health is 

2182
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:33,910
good and everything in Australia with 
the healthcare is great.

2183
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:39,250
And the arguments that sort of 
republican and on top like right,

2184
01:38:39,251 --> 01:38:44,251
yeah,
where they go I won't have as good 

2185
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:46,081
healthcare and,
and what about my great healthcare I 

2186
01:38:46,081 --> 01:38:46,081
have now and then I'll have you don't 
have,

2187
01:38:46,081 --> 01:38:47,380
you can still get private healthcare 
cover.

2188
01:38:47,381 --> 01:38:50,290
This is what people don't get.
You can still get the good private stuff

2189
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:56,040
but you have an ailment and not yet.
You will never know the price of one of 

2190
01:38:56,561 --> 01:38:57,550
your ailments.
Right.

2191
01:38:57,710 --> 01:38:59,120
That's the whole thing.
So,

2192
01:38:59,330 --> 01:39:01,510
so at the moment I,
a couple of moles,

2193
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:04,920
I went back because I had some cancerous
moles in my back cut out right there.

2194
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:08,260
The doctor has with the terminologies is
like it's $4,800

2195
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:13,370
to this.
I was thinking that can't fucking be 

2196
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:13,370
$4,100
to do it.

2197
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:16,641
Right.
So I went and checked with another 

2198
01:39:16,641 --> 01:39:18,400
total.
I'm dermatologist and I said 500 bucks 

2199
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,600
right now if I just had.
What happens with a private health care 

2200
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,280
cover in Britain,
you get everyone gets the same doctors,

2201
01:39:24,281 --> 01:39:27,670
but your.
If you're just using public health k you

2202
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:30,370
put on a waiting list so they might look
at your mall and go,

2203
01:39:30,371 --> 01:39:32,380
all right you two months before you can 
get that cut out,

2204
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:37,480
right.
Where if you have the private stuff on 

2205
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:39,811
top,
you guys strike to the beginning of the 

2206
01:39:39,811 --> 01:39:41,641
list,
but I never know how much I'm paying or 

2207
01:39:41,641 --> 01:39:42,400
how much they are charging or whatever.
So it's a regulated a lot better.

2208
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:47,640
I've have been here.
It feels like getting quotes from 

2209
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:47,640
fucking mechanic.

2210
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:47,640
Yeah,
it's totally like that.

2211
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:48,390
Especially dentist out here are the 
worst.

2212
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:51,690
Like dentist almost are trying to 
upgrade you with certain things that you

2213
01:39:51,691 --> 01:39:52,800
paused.
You pretty much.

2214
01:39:52,801 --> 01:39:57,801
Don't you think you need a feeling here 
because they wanted a few because this 

2215
01:39:57,801 --> 01:39:57,801
is fucking bullshit.
Yeah.

2216
01:39:57,801 --> 01:39:59,370
My Dad's trying to give me an 
invisalign.

2217
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:04,760
Yeah.
Mine was trying to give me a little bit 

2218
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:08,151
of crooked teeth.
Bottom couple of crooked like fuck that 

2219
01:40:08,151 --> 01:40:08,470
bitch visit lot.
Oh,

2220
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:11,550
it's like invisible braces.
You're going to get braces.

2221
01:40:11,551 --> 01:40:15,960
You better get just regular braces.
Some dudes got braces and it helped them

2222
01:40:15,961 --> 01:40:19,140
a lot like frank shamrock operations,
but his teeth were fucked up.

2223
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:24,380
My teeth are not that far.
Like Tom Cruise did it like a few years 

2224
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:24,380
ago,
like five years ago.

2225
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:25,950
Yeah.
It was always you take before.

2226
01:40:25,951 --> 01:40:27,800
I don't remember ever looking at his 
teeth like,

2227
01:40:27,801 --> 01:40:29,060
oh,
Tom's fucked.

2228
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:29,690
I don't know.
He's.

2229
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,890
He's probably crazy.
If you're famous,

2230
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,960
you must be completely out of your 
fucking mind.

2231
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:39,230
How do you be Tom Cruise?
I can't go anywhere in the world that 

2232
01:40:39,230 --> 01:40:42,591
someone known who he is and yet he's in 
a crazy cult organization and yet 

2233
01:40:43,651 --> 01:40:45,730
there's rumors of him being gay.
I mean,

2234
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:49,530
you want to talk about like a dark 
circle of secrets.

2235
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:53,790
If Tom Cruise really is gay,
that would be the ultimate reality show.

2236
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:53,980
It's

2237
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,740
a room of people just never shut up and 
even.

2238
01:40:56,770 --> 01:40:59,950
And I will say even people in the 
industry.

2239
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:00,880
Yeah.
Oh Dude,

2240
01:41:00,881 --> 01:41:05,881
I've,
I've heard it from so many people that 

2241
01:41:05,881 --> 01:41:06,890
I've heard people say that they thought 
it was him and Travolta and.

2242
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:07,930
Yeah,
exactly.

2243
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:12,960
Especially Travolta Travolta.
I think they caught him with a photo 

2244
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,340
kissing that guy getting on the plane.
Yeah.

2245
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:18,430
Who was the nanny and come on man.
You know,

2246
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:20,290
I mean maybe this is just weird like 
that.

2247
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:25,320
He could just be.
But there's a lot of people that say 

2248
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:25,960
they've had sex with him and he's just 
whatever,

2249
01:41:25,961 --> 01:41:28,300
man.
Let the guy be gay who gives a shit.

2250
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:29,200
Yeah.
I didn't give a shit.

2251
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:32,200
I would be happier for the guy if he 
would just come out.

2252
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:33,580
You know,
nobody cares.

2253
01:41:33,581 --> 01:41:35,350
This goddamn John Travolta.
People love him.

2254
01:41:35,351 --> 01:41:38,560
They love him from Saturday night fever 
from pulp fiction.

2255
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:40,480
They would.
We personally know.

2256
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:41,890
Of course we not going to say,
hey,

2257
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:46,950
we personally know comedians who are gay
who keep it under wraps as sad as shit 

2258
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:49,060
ever.
And I always think comics,

2259
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:51,790
especially women,
to be the most honest of them all.

2260
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:52,840
Yeah,
exactly.

2261
01:41:52,841 --> 01:41:54,610
You know what I mean?
We're not playing characters.

2262
01:41:54,611 --> 01:41:56,590
We're playing ourselves.
I feel like.

2263
01:41:56,850 --> 01:42:01,850
And then some of them were like MDF.
No.

2264
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:05,180
Here's my.
I'm going to tell you.

2265
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:06,910
Tell me.
You tell me if you agree.

2266
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:09,400
I find that the ones that keep it in the
closet,

2267
01:42:09,401 --> 01:42:11,230
they always have a problem with 
creativity.

2268
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,630
They always have a problem with coming 
up with new material because uh,

2269
01:42:14,631 --> 01:42:19,631
they're not,
they're not really alive in their own 

2270
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:21,460
life,
like free and open and unrestricted,

2271
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:26,550
so it's more difficult for them to come 
up with material and especially because 

2272
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:26,980
they can't draw in real life 
experiences,

2273
01:42:26,981 --> 01:42:28,000
the gay stuff.

2274
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:31,720
So they're like really like in this 
weird pocket of bullshit where they,

2275
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:35,350
they're the ones that a guy that you're 
not even allowed to say it to them.

2276
01:42:35,351 --> 01:42:37,360
And then there's the ones with the 
comedy community,

2277
01:42:37,361 --> 01:42:39,300
we can all say the president's game.
Right,

2278
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:39,850
right,
right.

2279
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:40,960
Um,
but you know,

2280
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:46,040
there's a fairly famous older black 
gentleman who he gets angry if you.

2281
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:49,150
Oh yeah,
he'll get very mad.

2282
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:50,720
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

2283
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:53,490
He's old school.
He'll fight you fight you.

2284
01:42:53,610 --> 01:42:55,190
You're like,
there's,

2285
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:57,460
there's more than one of those.
By the way,

2286
01:42:57,660 --> 01:42:58,890
there's more than one of those.
John,

2287
01:42:58,891 --> 01:43:00,620
I could have been talking about either 
one of them.

2288
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:07,890
I think it might be harder in the black 
community and that might be very 

2289
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:10,471
ignorant to me to sign up.
I think it might be harder in the black 

2290
01:43:10,471 --> 01:43:10,471
community of that generation.
I'd be willing to guess.

2291
01:43:10,471 --> 01:43:12,680
Yes.
I don't know or yeah,

2292
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:14,920
I don't know,
but I think if I had a time machine,

2293
01:43:14,921 --> 01:43:17,350
I don't think I'd go back in time to the
black community,

2294
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:22,370
that general.
Remember an episode of Good Times where 

2295
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:24,931
they were gay,
buried like Diana mileage.

2296
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:28,990
God,
I don't know.

2297
01:43:28,991 --> 01:43:32,050
Maybe it would suck though.
Dom irrera so fucking funny.

2298
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:37,260
He said,
I wish I was gay just so I could come 

2299
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:39,301
out and he's been.
He really is that guy.

2300
01:43:39,431 --> 01:43:43,360
He does not give a fuck.
Like he's not pretending to knock.

2301
01:43:43,361 --> 01:43:45,340
He really doesn't give a fuck.
So when he says something,

2302
01:43:45,341 --> 01:43:47,260
I wish I was gay just so I could come 
out.

2303
01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:53,230
It's like extra funny.
It is like an extra little treat they 

2304
01:43:53,230 --> 01:43:53,990
get in life.
The color coming out.

2305
01:43:53,991 --> 01:43:55,340
Yeah.
And have everybody embrace you.

2306
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,310
We love you for your personality.
We don't care.

2307
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:00,140
I'd love to have people ring me up one 
day and go,

2308
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:02,820
I still love you.
Just there's no reason.

2309
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:08,070
People who,
people who haven't said they loved me 

2310
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:08,070
ever.
Just to say they still love me once.

2311
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:09,200
That would be fucking awesome.
Yeah.

2312
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:11,850
I think in the people that you lose,
if you.

2313
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:13,340
If you're a gay guy and he came out of 
the closet,

2314
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,550
do you really want that guy?
No,

2315
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:19,570
I don't want them to see.
Then you get the double and so you lose 

2316
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:19,570
a Granddad,
but then a few years later he's like,

2317
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:24,551
you know what?
I don't want to be back in your life 

2318
01:44:24,551 --> 01:44:27,221
again,
and then you get another little present 

2319
01:44:27,221 --> 01:44:29,770
on top if your Granddad,
but then what if he just talks about it 

2320
01:44:29,770 --> 01:44:32,590
while you're fishing last week,
tell your grandpa fucking freak.

2321
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:35,540
You can't just be with a girl.
Is it really that bad?

2322
01:44:35,541 --> 01:44:38,660
Girls are pretty and all of a sudden 
you're stuck on a boat when he angry.

2323
01:44:38,661 --> 01:44:43,640
GRANDPA has a remarkable like truth that
the girls are very pretty.

2324
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:46,190
He is right.
You know a lot of them are.

2325
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:48,740
That's the confusing thing about 
homosexuality.

2326
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:50,840
What are they thinking?
Well,

2327
01:44:50,841 --> 01:44:55,841
the confused aren't heterosexual.
I will fight for their right to think 

2328
01:44:55,841 --> 01:44:55,841
that way,
but I'll never understand it.

2329
01:44:55,841 --> 01:44:59,010
You can feel about heterosexuality is 
what the fuck the girl seeing us.

2330
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:03,530
I don't understand why anyone's fucking 
men on either side.

2331
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:06,550
No one should be fucking men.
Yeah.

2332
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:11,560
It doesn't look like fun to me.
Especially when you get into weird shit 

2333
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:11,960
that you'll never understand.
Like girls will want to be choked.

2334
01:45:12,350 --> 01:45:17,350
Like can you even relate to that?
Wait a contortionist last night on the 

2335
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:19,670
night show and she can put her leg up 
here and she likes to be choked.

2336
01:45:19,671 --> 01:45:21,530
Well fucking like,
wow,

2337
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:23,420
that's crazy.
Selects a trailer.

2338
01:45:23,421 --> 01:45:25,970
So triangle or puts her leg over her 
shoulders.

2339
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,220
Does she lock it up?
Whoa.

2340
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:30,050
She triangles herself.
That's good.

2341
01:45:30,051 --> 01:45:35,051
Because then because you chose to go and
then you get that bit where their eyes 

2342
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:36,530
just rolled back a bit and you've got 
to.

2343
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:41,900
Oh,
trying to think if I could triangle 

2344
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:41,900
myself.
I don't need to see it.

2345
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:41,900
Man.
Shit.

2346
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:44,870
I'm pretty flexible in her legs up and 
put it behind her back.

2347
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:50,000
Even though you're flexible.
I don't think your legs are long enough,

2348
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:53,770
is longer than a miles like 
proportionate.

2349
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:58,780
Well not only that,
there's also the body's thinner so you 

2350
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:01,801
can compress it more and when you got 
body mass it's makes it more difficult 

2351
01:46:01,801 --> 01:46:02,050
to flatten out.
Sure.

2352
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:04,310
But you'd have to be in some serious 
flexible.

2353
01:46:04,311 --> 01:46:06,140
So she chokes herself and then what 
happens?

2354
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:11,420
She,
she was just showing us like what were 

2355
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:11,420
her favorite things?
While she's getting fucked,

2356
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:11,420
she was telling you that,
wow,

2357
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:14,710
that's a green lights on.
That girl wants to fuck with her.

2358
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:18,110
Did they're both.
They do burlesque here in Los Angeles.

2359
01:46:18,111 --> 01:46:21,060
Native is letting you know if a storm,
how she look,

2360
01:46:21,090 --> 01:46:23,850
what position she likes to be in when 
she gets extremely violent.

2361
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:25,040
How I came up to that.
Yeah.

2362
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:28,490
Do you need to aid?
I like a loyal soldier.

2363
01:46:28,491 --> 01:46:32,010
You need to jump on that girl.
Please help someone.

2364
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:33,180
Someone.
Someone else.

2365
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:35,900
Good for her.
What a good kid.

2366
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:38,180
What a lucky fella.
That lad.

2367
01:46:38,181 --> 01:46:43,181
He lucked out.
She's like this close this close from 

2368
01:46:43,181 --> 01:46:44,040
being able to eat her pussy.
I've seen girls eat their own person.

2369
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:45,400
I have to do that.
Yeah,

2370
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:47,240
that's crazy.
I've cut it out first.

2371
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:51,820
Defeated Jeffrey's again,
Scott.

2372
01:46:53,690 --> 01:46:56,150
I told you about it.
I could touch the tip of my tongue.

2373
01:46:56,170 --> 01:46:57,620
I have to Piss so bad.
Please talk.

2374
01:46:58,170 --> 01:46:59,610
We're actually not going to get going 
soon.

2375
01:46:59,611 --> 01:47:00,560
Should we?
Should we wrap up?

2376
01:47:00,890 --> 01:47:01,910
Let me Piss.
No rabbit.

2377
01:47:01,911 --> 01:47:03,220
Okay.
I could.

2378
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:06,440
I could touch the tip of my penis with 
my tongue,

2379
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:10,710
but once I do it and I'm like,
this is the gas thing is ridiculous.

2380
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:12,440
It's like,
why would we want to do that?

2381
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:13,830
It's yeah.
I,

2382
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:17,240
I've never been able to do that,
but I don't think I'd even.

2383
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:18,280
I think you would do it once

2384
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:19,610
just to have the.
Yeah,

2385
01:47:19,870 --> 01:47:21,990
it was like an elbow pretty much.

2386
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:27,190
It was like an elbow,
but like taste like and felt like an 

2387
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:27,740
elbow on your tongue.
I can't.

2388
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:30,340
I can't touch my elbow with my tongue.
Lose elbows.

2389
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:31,400
Just thinking.
Well,

2390
01:47:31,401 --> 01:47:32,160
I guess I could.
Yeah,

2391
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:32,560
I could do.

2392
01:47:32,770 --> 01:47:33,820
Hey.
Hey,

2393
01:47:33,821 --> 01:47:34,420
you can't.

2394
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:36,760
No,
no,

2395
01:47:37,010 --> 01:47:37,650
no.
You can't.

2396
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:40,050
You can't make your.
Must have links to other girls.

2397
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:42,330
I've probably never let a couple of 
girls.

2398
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:45,060
So the top of your cock fights like a 
girl's elbow?

2399
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,250
Yeah.
That's good.

2400
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:52,440
Now every time I look at girl fell,
but I'm going to feel like I'm sucking a

2401
01:47:52,441 --> 01:47:56,680
cock.
You have your own podcast podcast called

2402
01:47:56,790 --> 01:48:01,790
talking shit on itunes.
Always asked and we have bad we had.

2403
01:48:02,131 --> 01:48:04,100
He's always asking or telling me about 
how it is.

2404
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:05,790
Always take that into your shit.
Did they stop?

2405
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:07,170
Did they back off?
At the moment?

2406
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:12,200
We're on,
but we never get on your note worthy or 

2407
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:12,200
anything like that.
We never get any

2408
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:12,200
little thing,
but that's okay.

2409
01:48:12,430 --> 01:48:14,120
You ever thought about just changing the
name?

2410
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:17,420
The eddies very attached to it.
It's a,

2411
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:22,890
you know,
I'm not too bothered changing that in 

2412
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:23,750
the podcast because Archie's took us 
down a couple of times.

2413
01:48:23,751 --> 01:48:25,640
So yeah.
What would you call it?

2414
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:27,590
We're at the moment,
it's just,

2415
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:30,890
it's still talking shit,
but we just moved the s over to talking.

2416
01:48:30,891 --> 01:48:32,660
So it's talkings hit.
Oh,

2417
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:36,740
I see that with pepsis pace Pepsi space 
program.

2418
01:48:36,830 --> 01:48:37,850
Oh,
talkings hit.

2419
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:40,050
That's not bad.
That's not.

2420
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:42,500
That's actually good.
That's not bad.

2421
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:43,700
Yeah.
Leave it there.

2422
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:49,220
Everybody has a fucking says it's weird 
and it can't have shit on itunes.

2423
01:48:49,221 --> 01:48:51,590
Really rarely,
but what could be in the podcast,

2424
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:55,580
anything could offend someone to see the
word Shit.

2425
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:00,920
You know,
what kind of clientele you did say that 

2426
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:01,730
Mark Marin has wtf everyone knows what 
that means,

2427
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:06,050
you know,
like as long as it's abbreviated.

2428
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:09,950
But I always find those.
How insulting it is.

2429
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:14,980
Like when you get the sweater with,
it's made out of question marks and 

2430
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:15,110
symbols,
you know,

2431
01:49:15,111 --> 01:49:20,111
it gets me freaking.
This freaking guy pulls this freaking 

2432
01:49:20,111 --> 01:49:24,251
car and someone can do that in front of 
kids that can do that in front of old 

2433
01:49:24,251 --> 01:49:24,251
people.
You could say freaking in front of him,

2434
01:49:24,251 --> 01:49:25,380
but I've seen it.
It's like,

2435
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:28,550
to me it's just a lot of kids 
translating it.

2436
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:31,520
It's silly.
Freaking the silly.

2437
01:49:31,521 --> 01:49:32,480
You're saying,
fuck it.

2438
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:35,150
You're saying fucking this fucking guy 
cut me off.

2439
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:37,700
You're saying that,
but you're saying it to me in this weird

2440
01:49:37,701 --> 01:49:42,701
reserved way by saying freaking the RH,
the have a tech fic feck you fucking 

2441
01:49:45,621 --> 01:49:47,420
idiot.
You fucking chicken vic,

2442
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:47,870
vic,
vic,

2443
01:49:47,871 --> 01:49:48,250
vic.
Well,

2444
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:50,050
you know,
and they had on CNN,

2445
01:49:50,051 --> 01:49:52,150
they,
they said fucking over and over and over

2446
01:49:52,151 --> 01:49:55,270
again because they're playing back this 
tape from the Zimmerman Guy,

2447
01:49:55,420 --> 01:50:00,420
the nine slash 11 called the guy who 
supposedly he did kill that Trayvon 

2448
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:00,430
Martin Kid.

2449
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:01,060
Right,
right,

2450
01:50:01,061 --> 01:50:01,450
right,
right.

2451
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:06,480
Well,
they were wondering whether or not he 

2452
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:08,641
said he was on.
They recorded his phone call with the 

2453
01:50:08,641 --> 01:50:11,071
nine slash 11 guy.
They were wondering whether he said 

2454
01:50:11,071 --> 01:50:14,041
fucking coon.
So they're playing over and over and 

2455
01:50:14,041 --> 01:50:18,691
over.
They bring in all these like special 

2456
01:50:18,691 --> 01:50:20,401
enhancements at the end,
they believe you saying fucking cold 

2457
01:50:20,401 --> 01:50:22,180
because it was raining and cold that day
in Florida,

2458
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:27,270
but the minute they spent like 15 
minutes playing this back and forth 

2459
01:50:27,270 --> 01:50:28,270
talking about it and Wolf Blitzer 
saying,

2460
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:30,820
so now ladies and gentlemen,
if you have kids,

2461
01:50:30,821 --> 01:50:35,821
please,
I'd like you to ask him to leave the 

2462
01:50:35,821 --> 01:50:37,771
room right now.
You're going to hear some very strong 

2463
01:50:37,771 --> 01:50:40,021
language.
We have brought in a voice expert who 

2464
01:50:40,021 --> 01:50:43,921
has analyzed Mr Zimmerman's tone and any
plays it back fucking comes fucking 

2465
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:49,720
Koons fucking coons.
And then they have brought in a new guy.

2466
01:50:49,721 --> 01:50:54,721
It's really kind of fucked up that they 
did this this way because then they 

2467
01:50:54,721 --> 01:50:54,760
brought in like a new recording and they
said,

2468
01:50:54,761 --> 01:50:59,761
well,
now in this new recording you believe 

2469
01:50:59,761 --> 01:51:01,870
that it's not that correct,
and the guy goes,

2470
01:51:01,871 --> 01:51:02,410
yes.

2471
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:06,460
When we play it back now it says,
fucking cold.

2472
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:11,050
You hear the guy say fucking cultural.
You already had that information,

2473
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:15,630
but you played all this other shit where
it's at fucking coon fucking coon.

2474
01:51:15,650 --> 01:51:20,290
You knew that's not what he said.
He drew people in and kept me listening.

2475
01:51:21,310 --> 01:51:26,310
Tricking me with your old information.
You played back your old information to 

2476
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:30,070
rope people in you fucking whoever did 
that as dirty.

2477
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:33,610
That's a dirty move.
Fucking because I was hearing that guy.

2478
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:37,450
My opinion of them as I was driving my 
opinion changed.

2479
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:38,980
I'm here fucking coon.
I'm like,

2480
01:51:38,981 --> 01:51:40,780
whoa.
He's calling fucking coon.

2481
01:51:40,930 --> 01:51:41,980
Really?
Like,

2482
01:51:41,981 --> 01:51:44,290
wow,
this motherfucker's on phone.

2483
01:51:44,410 --> 01:51:47,340
He's on nine slash 11 and he's just 
calling this kid a fucking coon,

2484
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:49,390
eh?
This is what they had me believing.

2485
01:51:49,391 --> 01:51:50,320
And then I'm like,
wow.

2486
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:53,140
That was probably a piece of shit.
And then I hear my fucking cold.

2487
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:53,550
Like,
oh,

2488
01:51:53,551 --> 01:51:55,930
he's kind of a bitch,
kind of a whiner,

2489
01:51:56,050 --> 01:51:58,220
which makes sense in the first place if 
you know,

2490
01:51:58,270 --> 01:52:00,040
if it ended up.
His story is true.

2491
01:52:00,041 --> 01:52:02,200
If the 17 year old kids on top of him 
beating him up.

2492
01:52:02,310 --> 01:52:03,880
All right.
I also have to urinate.

2493
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,470
Dude.
Let's get this fucking thing over with.

2494
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:12,000
If you look for Jim on twitter,
it's Jeff or jeffery j e s,

2495
01:52:13,070 --> 01:52:18,070
s I fucked up and tweeted earlier.
There's another guy who impersonates me 

2496
01:52:18,070 --> 01:52:21,700
and spending some fake ass bitch.
There's a lot of them out there.

2497
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:22,870
Folks.
Don't be one.

2498
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:25,540
You have the power to control your right
life,

2499
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:28,900
right Jim,
you certainly can give it a go.

2500
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:31,720
Give it a go.
Check out their podcast.

01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:37,570
tonight.
What's today?

2504
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:38,560
Friday now.
Oh Shit.

2505
01:52:38,561 --> 01:52:40,120
We got to do another podcast moments 
from now.

2506
01:52:40,430 --> 01:52:42,010
By the time you hear this,
if you're in your car,

2507
01:52:42,011 --> 01:52:47,011
it sort of taken place.
The only way to hear it though is to go 

2508
01:52:47,011 --> 01:52:47,011
to desk squad on itunes

2509
01:52:47,011 --> 01:52:51,940
and subscribe and there's a bunch of 
other podcasts and they're all of them 

2510
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:51,940
at this point in time.
Over money.

2511
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:55,990
You're happy with all of them.
I'm really happy with the new ones with 

2512
01:52:55,990 --> 01:52:55,990
a Dana d,
airman,

2513
01:52:55,990 --> 01:52:57,140
and uh,
Ryan Keeley.

2514
01:52:57,230 --> 01:53:00,200
Oh,
I didn't know mf said comic book one.

2515
01:53:00,201 --> 01:53:03,360
And then last night we started sex squad
backup with people.

2516
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:08,960
Are you going to do that other girl?
The girls still call it sex squad.

2517
01:53:08,961 --> 01:53:09,400
Okay.
Where's?

2518
01:53:09,401 --> 01:53:10,250
She goes,
oh,

2519
01:53:10,251 --> 01:53:12,500
come on Brian.
You confused the shit out of people.

2520
01:53:12,501 --> 01:53:14,840
You should be been confusing the shit 
out of people.

2521
01:53:14,841 --> 01:53:16,430
I say.
I say,

2522
01:53:16,431 --> 01:53:18,560
you let them have that.
I say you'd be a bigger,

2523
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:19,520
bigger,
better man.

2524
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:22,220
It has the word squad in it.
It wasn't her show.

2525
01:53:23,290 --> 01:53:27,830
A lot of people.
I didn't really want to talk about this,

2526
01:53:27,831 --> 01:53:30,770
but let's talk about this real quick.
I go to somebody and be like,

2527
01:53:30,771 --> 01:53:32,980
Hey,
I want to do a show on my podcast.

2528
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:37,040
It's a sex based podcasts and I'm ready 
to call it sex to cast.

2529
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:40,610
And then Jaden coil goes,
why don't you just call it sex squad?

2530
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:41,990
I'm like,
okay,

2531
01:53:41,991 --> 01:53:42,590
yeah,
that makes sense.

2532
01:53:42,591 --> 01:53:43,400
And then I'm like,
Hey,

2533
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:48,430
do you want to come on the show and 
empty when it come on the show somebody 

2534
01:53:48,430 --> 01:53:51,011
else and somebody else.
And then they just kind of stopped 

2535
01:53:51,011 --> 01:53:51,011
talking to me like,
Hey,

2536
01:53:51,011 --> 01:53:51,011
we're doing this show.
Listen,

2537
01:53:51,011 --> 01:53:55,451
I completely agree with you on that.
They should have said something to you 

2538
01:53:55,821 --> 01:53:58,980
and that's not cool for them to leave 
and take name.

2539
01:53:59,130 --> 01:54:02,960
But all I'm saying is let them know what
do you care?

2540
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:05,390
You can have another name.
They could take another name.

2541
01:54:06,290 --> 01:54:07,970
You know why?
Because I created a show.

2542
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,950
I was co hosted the show.
I paid for the show.

2543
01:54:09,951 --> 01:54:13,850
I did the show and it was not their show
to begin with.

2544
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:18,880
They weren't,
there were people on the show and I 

2545
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:18,950
understand,
but they wanted to do it on the road.

2546
01:54:18,980 --> 01:54:22,780
So you should have changed the name,
but why wouldn't you just give a this?

2547
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:24,050
I don't give a fuck.
You know,

2548
01:54:24,051 --> 01:54:25,610
I don't give a fuck.
Okay.

2549
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:27,250
I would just say that you know,
the,

2550
01:54:27,540 --> 01:54:32,540
the girl,
you're pretty much telling me or like 

2551
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:32,540
right now,
don't use that Avatar on facebook.

2552
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:33,890
No,
that's not what I'm saying.

2553
01:54:34,110 --> 01:54:35,170
Yes.
You are saying,

2554
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:35,720
look,
they,

2555
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:37,400
that you were going to do this show with
them.

2556
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:39,250
You're not going to do it anymore.
You're going to do another one.

2557
01:54:39,251 --> 01:54:41,750
It was supposed to not be with them 100 
percent.

2558
01:54:41,751 --> 01:54:43,640
It was supposed to be other people on 
the show.

2559
01:54:43,670 --> 01:54:48,670
It was them.
Sometimes they kind of plotted on the 

2560
01:54:48,670 --> 01:54:48,670
ship.
Do you only do it with them?

2561
01:54:48,670 --> 01:54:53,500
Yeah,
but Ryan Keeley and a couple other 

2562
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:53,500
people were.

2563
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:53,500
We're supposed to be on the show at 
points of time,

2564
01:54:53,540 --> 01:54:57,020
but they kind of talked me out of it 
type stuff.

2565
01:54:57,060 --> 01:54:57,920
Okay.
But they.

2566
01:54:57,921 --> 01:55:00,770
So they did talk you out of it though 
and all the episodes they did.

2567
01:55:00,771 --> 01:55:03,600
Where would just them no one time they 
had already should fear,

2568
01:55:03,630 --> 01:55:06,140
but I was the host of the show.
Okay.

2569
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:07,460
I'm the one that was like,
hey,

2570
01:55:07,461 --> 01:55:08,970
this is brian coming here from ice 
house.

2571
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:10,340
We're here again.
What's up?

2572
01:55:10,341 --> 01:55:12,350
Jaded.
But in all fairness,

2573
01:55:12,351 --> 01:55:17,351
in all fairness,
and I'm on your side for this because 

2574
01:55:17,351 --> 01:55:17,870
first of all,
you can't just take a guy's show if he's

2575
01:55:17,871 --> 01:55:20,900
the host of it and you don't know what 
you tell them and run somewhere else.

2576
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:26,020
But didn't that Jayden Coal Guy didn't?
She actually just told you exactly what 

2577
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:28,250
happened.
I said I wanted to do a podcast.

2578
01:55:28,251 --> 01:55:33,251
It was called sex and she goes,
you should call it sex squad because 

2579
01:55:33,251 --> 01:55:34,850
it's on the death squad podcasts.

2580
01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:36,640
Now I heard that,
but didn't.

2581
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:38,720
That's her name.
Then she invented it.

2582
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:43,750
She could do whatever she wants.
I'm the one that fucking used it and 

2583
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:43,750
made paid for it and made a podcast with
it.

2584
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:46,600
Getting crazy again.
So without a debt,

2585
01:55:46,610 --> 01:55:48,960
without me creating death or mi using 
desk squad,

2586
01:55:48,970 --> 01:55:53,970
her knowing death squad,
would she have ever used the word quad 

2587
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:53,970
squad?
Who knows?

2588
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:58,401
Exactly.
So she did is she took the half of 50 

2589
01:55:58,401 --> 01:55:58,800
percent of it for me.
But isn't there other sex squads online?

2590
01:55:59,510 --> 01:56:04,510
There's tons of sex squad.
I didn't create sex on top in Anthony 

2591
01:56:04,510 --> 01:56:04,510
Nolan or,
or whatever.

2592
01:56:04,510 --> 01:56:05,510
It's,
you know,

2593
01:56:05,511 --> 01:56:05,950
it's,
it's,

2594
01:56:06,030 --> 01:56:11,030
there's actually another company that 
makes it a sexual harassment videos for 

2595
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:15,060
fucking school,
so it's not even something that's 

2596
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:15,060
original.
Anyway,

2597
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:15,150
I don't do it,
but all I'm saying is,

2598
01:56:15,210 --> 01:56:17,070
look,
she shouldn't take it for sure.

2599
01:56:17,090 --> 01:56:17,320
No,
no,

2600
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:19,980
no.
I didn't take it.

2601
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:25,340
I can fucking sit here and show you 
about 50 text messages that I got from 

2602
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:25,340
Jayden.
Jayden.

2603
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:25,950
Okay.
Let's wait.

2604
01:56:25,951 --> 01:56:26,670
Wait,
I could do that,

2605
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:28,740
but I didn't.
But you know what she did?

2606
01:56:28,770 --> 01:56:32,010
She went on her website and blogs a bad 
fucking posted shit about.

2607
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:36,510
I could say show the shit that shit.
Don't you of feel bad that that's her.

2608
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:38,150
That's what she's doing.
Don't you kind of feel bad.

2609
01:56:38,230 --> 01:56:40,290
I feel bad about this whole situation.
I feel bad.

2610
01:56:40,291 --> 01:56:45,291
But you know what?
They're not using the sex squad name 

2611
01:56:45,291 --> 01:56:45,291
they had.
They started the first Tuesday.

2612
01:56:45,291 --> 01:56:46,310
Show that they're calling it something 
like sex squid or it's just spell it.

2613
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:49,680
All right,
let's let them do whatever the fuck they

2614
01:56:49,681 --> 01:56:51,420
want.
I don't give a shit what I said.

2615
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:56,421
It's why don't you please not use the 
word squad because it confuses a show 

2616
01:56:56,421 --> 01:57:00,090
that we already started with sex.
Let me just clarify one thing.

2617
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:05,010
I don't ever like to get as worked up 
about a stupid name as you just did.

2618
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:06,890
Well,
I don't like to get bashed on somebody.

2619
01:57:09,070 --> 01:57:14,070
You.
You're not getting bashed by a balanced 

2620
01:57:14,070 --> 01:57:14,070
person.
I certainly would,

2621
01:57:14,070 --> 01:57:18,830
but you could have avoided this conflict
with her if she wants to do things and 

2622
01:57:18,991 --> 01:57:20,610
take that elsewhere.
You tell him no,

2623
01:57:20,611 --> 01:57:23,460
but I thought jd is a good friend of 
mine.

2624
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:26,350
She didn't fucking say one word to me.
She didn't make one call.

2625
01:57:26,490 --> 01:57:28,710
They said that they get returned phone 
calls and stuff.

2626
01:57:28,711 --> 01:57:31,530
They made shit up about me.
They can fucking eat it depths.

2627
01:57:31,531 --> 01:57:36,531
Unfortunate,
but that's called fucking slander and I 

2628
01:57:36,531 --> 01:57:37,410
didn't even fucking do shit.
All these fucking making shit up mouth.

2629
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:39,870
Don't have that kind of power over you,
man.

2630
01:57:39,871 --> 01:57:42,240
Just cut them loose.
Cut them loose in life.

2631
01:57:42,241 --> 01:57:43,620
Don't.
Don't hate on him.

2632
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:44,340
Anyways,
the new.

2633
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:46,680
The new.
Okay.

2634
01:57:46,770 --> 01:57:51,750
I'm glad we called them the new sex 
squad.

2635
01:57:51,751 --> 01:57:53,490
How about that?
The new sex club review,

2636
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:57,350
but sex squad with Dana dear to,
to one data,

2637
01:57:57,380 --> 01:57:57,900
her giant.

2638
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:00,070
But remember once you told her she has a
giant but she is.

2639
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:02,010
Listen man,
I don't like you can see and you get all

2640
01:58:02,011 --> 01:58:07,011
worked up like getting A.
I don't like lies talking shit on me and

2641
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:08,610
slander.
I understand.

2642
01:58:08,690 --> 01:58:09,840
If they would've just came to me and be 
like,

2643
01:58:09,841 --> 01:58:11,480
Hey,
can we do this podcast somewhere else?

2644
01:58:11,481 --> 01:58:12,360
And be like,
you know what?

2645
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,720
Okay,
what didn't you like about the podcasts?

2646
01:58:14,730 --> 01:58:16,780
You listen,
let's end this shit.

2647
01:58:16,781 --> 01:58:18,300
Stupid Shit.
Alright folks,

2648
