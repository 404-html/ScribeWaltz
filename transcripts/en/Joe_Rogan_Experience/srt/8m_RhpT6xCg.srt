1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,520
Headphone sir.
Do I have him there?

2
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:13,470
Better lock in. I would live.
Hey Andrew. I do it. I'm good.

3
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,020
How are you? I'm good man. What's up,
chilling, man. Thanks for having me.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,560
Thanks for being here. Of
course. Of course. I like.
What are you doing? Thank you.

5
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,140
I like a lot of things. Are you doing
a, first of all I liked that you're,

6
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:26,610
you decided to put all your
shit on Youtube. Yes. Fuck
it. Fuck it. Look, it's hard.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,590
There's about a million
fucking comedians today, right?

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,910
There's more comedians now than ever
these off. Is that a locking door?

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,680
There's like a million comedians today.
Yeah.

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,610
And a lot of these
companies are overwhelmed.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,240
You have no room for all these up and
coming guys that are coming up and you

12
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:49,380
know some, some guys like you are really
good and there's, they're looking,

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,260
you know, like how do you, how
do you get your shit out there?

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,740
Well it just put it out there
on Youtube. Exactly that. Yeah.

15
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,490
I mean everybody just said No. To me that
was a thing. So I didn't have a choice.

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,060
Well a lot of people that's happened
in the Brian Cowen right now. Right.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,810
And then he just did his right. Posted his
thing, but he's releasing it on iTunes.

18
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:11,100
He's releasing it on all
the other platforms, but
there's no fucking room. Yeah.

19
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:14,620
It's, it's a weird thing because,
uh, I guess for me, you know, the,

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,360
the standard industry wasn't really
inviting to me even from the beginning.

21
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,160
So a couple of years ago I filled my
own and especially when I did it in New

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,970
York and I did the five clubs and I did
the cab rides in between and the idea

23
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:28,860
was, all right, if you don't fuck with me,

24
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,070
at least you can appreciate this part of
stand up that is being a New York guy.

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,550
Did you do 15 minutes sets in this place?
Oh Wow. That's cool. Yeah. So it was like,

26
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,030
I was like, if you love the game, yeah,

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,010
you at least we'll take a look at
this and maybe support this. Right.

28
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,080
And everybody said No.
Like Cecil said, no.

29
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,470
Whoa. And I had a show
with them, like, like Bro,

30
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:56,570
it was humbling, you know, and uh,

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,940
but I just believed in the project and
I thought it was dope. So I cut like a,

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,250
I could have 15 minute version, but
I'll tell you what I did is because, uh,

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,300
you can learn everything you would need
about standup from asking people who

34
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:08,940
don't do stand up. Really? Yeah.

35
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:11,760
Like I asked all my friends and just
people I would meet, I'll be like, well,

36
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:13,950
you watching these days and you know,

37
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,530
they'd say the names that we all
know and then they'd always say this,

38
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:19,260
they'd be like, uh, yeah, it was, it
was funny man, but I didn't finish it.

39
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,710
Everybody said that. Right. And I was
like, all right, so as too long. Yeah.

40
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,980
So I cut it down to 15.

41
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,150
I did like a 15 minute version of the
special ed for clubs and I just put it

42
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,120
right on to youtube.
And, um, it was weird.

43
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:36,270
I liked sold out shows that we can as
San Diego and I was never a sellout guy.

44
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:36,831
You know,

45
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:39,210
I have a few guys come out from the
podcast I do and that kind of stuff,

46
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:42,990
but it was never like a, like a
sellout, you know? And I was like,

47
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:46,990
well that's kind of weird. And then I did
a show in like Columbus, Ohio, you know,

48
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:51,720
the, the, what is it? The funny bone out
there, a great club, great club. And um,

49
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,760
I think we sold like 1600 tickets and
I was like, what the fuck is happening?

50
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:00,070
Like I was never, not
in Ohio, you know, and

51
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,500
like people are coming out and like, I
liked your thing. I was like, Oh shit,

52
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,600
maybe people are,
are watching this.

53
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,570
And I started to kind of like sit
back for a second. I was like,

54
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:10,450
why are people watching man? Maybe it's
short. And I was like, all right, fuck it.

55
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:14,170
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm going
to put a joke out a week for a year.

56
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,161
You know,

57
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:19,210
I got another 45 minutes left to the
special and I could probably produce some

58
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:22,480
more stand up.
I'll just put a joke out a week.

59
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,690
There was this singer who is doing that
and like he just put a song out a week,

60
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:30,940
his name is Russ. And I was like, all
right, that's, he's a worker. I can,

61
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,140
I can at least control that. I can
outwork somebody. So I'll do that. And uh,

62
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,400
I put the choke out for a weekend.

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,700
Like the jokes are to go and like someone
would go viral and I was like, Yo,

64
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:43,600
this is crazy. And people would come out
to shows and in my youtube guy hits me,

65
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:46,450
he goes, Yo, something weird is
happening. I go, what's up? And he goes,

66
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,670
when people watch a clip to
watch for two hours, I go,

67
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:56,290
do you mean like they'll just get lost in
a wormhole? And I go, so wait a minute.

68
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,660
So people aren't watching
an hour of stand up

69
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,690
on the networks because it's too long,
but they're watching two hours of mine.

70
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:09,430
I'm like, why the fuck would that
happen? And we figured out that it was,

71
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,630
you made the choice when you
are in control of your destiny,

72
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,300
right?
You invest as much time as you.

73
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:20,260
One is hitting snooze on the alarm clock
so that I'll take another eight minutes,

74
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,040
I'll take another eight minutes. I won't
set my alarm clock for an hour later.

75
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,660
Yeah, that would be irresponsible.
But I'll snooze snooze,

76
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:32,530
snooze and when people make their
own fucking choice, it was like,

77
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,510
it was just crazy to
see what happened man.

78
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,610
It's also the platform, the platform,
you people on their phones. Uh,

79
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,820
Netflix told me that half the people
that watch my special watch on a four

80
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,320
course. Absolutely. So people that are
watching phones, they're there. You're,

81
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:51,270
you're on that goddamn thing all day
long and it's way easy to flip a channel.

82
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,050
It's ways you just, you got that
remote in your hand anyway. Yeah,

83
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,930
that's a really good point. When you're
on your phone, you're going full screen.

84
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,000
You got to like tap it,
move it

85
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,870
and you don't know what's next.
I know if I turned this channels ESPN too.

86
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,250
Exactly. I don't know if I leave this
video, what I'm going to see next. Yeah,

87
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,480
100% little

88
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:08,871
bit of that.

89
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:12,210
There's a little bit of phone addiction
that contributes to a lot of views,

90
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,150
but people love fucking youtube.
Youtube never ends.

91
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,990
You could be on it for the rest of your
life and not put a dent in the content

92
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,830
that's on there. I mean, it's a space.
Yes. Especially if you have like me,

93
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:28,250
I got a lot of weird interests. Like you
look at like what it suggests for me,

94
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,020
it's like shit on the cosmos, muscle
cars, professional pool matches,

95
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:37,400
MMA. It's chaos. The archery
elk hunting and shit.

96
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,970
It's crazy.
Like I could never leave my fucking house,

97
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,290
just sit with my phone plugged in the
wall and just on my birthday and shit to

98
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,510
you, right? Oh yeah. And they were
like, yeah, I do want to check that out.

99
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,620
Soon as they did that, I, I saw this
when back when there was no suggestions.

100
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:53,970
Remember those days? Of
course, the dark day. Yeah.

101
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,900
Well as soon as they start suggesting
shit, I was like, oh my God, that's a,

102
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,640
that's a game changer. And then the next
video just automatically plays like, ah,

103
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,474
you got us.

104
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,590
Yes, it's over. It's like,
it's just right there.

105
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:08,190
You have all your access points to
it, you know? Yeah. I mean that,

106
00:06:08,191 --> 00:06:12,190
that was the beauty of it. I found. It's
like, you know, with a special your fee,

107
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:17,450
you're maybe the best joke that you have
on your special to someone else is 33

108
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:18,514
minutes in.

109
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,030
So that guy has got a wait 33 minutes
hoping you're gonna hit that joke right on

110
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:29,290
youtube. Like if I had your special, not
cut it up to jokes on Youtube, what topic?

111
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,530
Not, you know, everything
under an umbrella, you know,

112
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,520
and you have an access point here you
have let's say six different access points

113
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,550
with a new special I have out now.
Right? It's, it's six different pieces.

114
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,680
So as a different access
point every single time,

115
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,210
some people might come for a Trump joke,

116
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:45,940
some people might come for a trainee
joke. It doesn't matter. Right?

117
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,050
So it's not the situation
where you have to go, okay,

118
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:52,960
maybe I hit 37 minutes in
this bit that I love. No,

119
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:54,310
you're going to get that bill right away.

120
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,920
And then you're going to go back
to the beginning and go, okay,

121
00:06:56,921 --> 00:07:00,700
I'm going to watch this all
the way through. It's the
music model. Like for me,

122
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,430
I didn't invent anything.
I just stole it from music.

123
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,200
Musicians put out a single
for a reason. I, I kinda,

124
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,940
I like that. If you thinking about
marketing, yes. Complete, complete.

125
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,000
Like you and I are and way different
places with standup. Right?

126
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:18,700
Like you're one of the most
famous people in the world, right?

127
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:21,370
So you don't need to find
new people to see you.

128
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,500
People are going to watch your standup
because they're like, all right,

129
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,180
I have an intimate
relationship with this guy.

130
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:29,500
I listened to him eight hours a week and
I just want to see his standup. Right?

131
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,030
I'm still in marketing phase. I'm like,
how can I get New People to see me?

132
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,630
There's five people that should have
comedy specials now that's more,

133
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,590
there's five Jeff out to get lighters.

134
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,120
Do Rock, Chappelle, Louis [inaudible].

135
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,220
That's it. Everybody else
should be an acquisition face.

136
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,380
Why?
I don't know

137
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,120
both up man. I don't know. I don't buy
into that. I don't know. First of all,

138
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:59,420
I don't think that way. I never worry
about it with other people are doing.

139
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,640
I just don't think about it.

140
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,800
And then to all I concentrate on
is doing my best shit. That's it.

141
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,071
Right.

142
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:09,950
And once I got to a point where I was
successful enough where I didn't have to

143
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:11,960
worry about money,
it was a huge relief.

144
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:15,530
And honestly I think I started
doing my best work of course,

145
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,480
because then I wasn't thinking,

146
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:22,481
I didn't have any resources that were
dialed into how do I promote this and how

147
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:26,330
do I get that going? All my resources
like this bit needs something more.

148
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:28,730
I've got to figure out
how to really sell that.

149
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:33,320
I know I got to put maybe if I switched
it around and so it's all about alchemy.

150
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,500
Yeah. You know, it's all about
adding shit and trying to make gold.

151
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,790
All I'm doing is like starring in the lab,
trying to make goals.

152
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,870
And you love creating though.
Yeah. Well I don't have,

153
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,950
there's no thoughts on marketing now,
but that's,

154
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,500
you found that you love
creating. Yeah, for sure. I've
always loved creating. Yeah.

155
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,480
People. Some people don't
know that. Like some,

156
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,320
I feel like success teaches
you exactly what you wanted.

157
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,620
Like these people who blow up with
standup and never do it again. Yeah.

158
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,220
They never wanted to be a standup.
Right, right, right, right.

159
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:04,221
It's like if you blow up and all you're
thinking about is how do I make this toe

160
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:08,280
knuckle hair joke better? You
love the game. You're like,

161
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,511
I don't know.

162
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:14,220
The greatest thing that ever happened
for me was I stopped desiring things I

163
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,170
couldn't control. Right.
Like I realized, Oh,

164
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:20,910
I don't care about a special on HBO or
Netflix. I just wanted people to see it.

165
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,600
Right.
And if they see it and 10 people see it,

166
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:27,450
that's cool because I just loved making
it and if a million people see it,

167
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,180
that's also cool. But if anybody
sees it as gratitude, right.

168
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,800
Do you see what I'm saying? Like before
I was just this void, like so many,

169
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:37,980
so much of us are like comics. I was
just like trying to fill up, you know,

170
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:41,510
like I'm sure you get people asking to
be on the show and all that shit on it

171
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:45,470
all the time and like, it's just comics
trying to take fill themselves. Like,

172
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,310
and I was entitled Little
Fucking Brat Probably.

173
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:49,000
Why don't I have a special one on one?
I have this,

174
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,170
there's a lot of that going on.
It's useless bro. But I couldn't,

175
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,460
you know how like every rich person goes,
uh,

176
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,590
money doesn't make you happy and every
poor person is like, man, when I'm rich,

177
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:02,070
I'm gonna be happy. Yeah.
I feel like it's like dad,

178
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:06,750
like I needed to get a certain
amount of success for me to realize,

179
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,880
man,
I just love making these things.

180
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,600
Everybody does. It's like
everybody does. And if you don't,

181
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,350
if you don't mean you're,
you're either blessed or stupid.

182
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,030
You're like one of those things. It's,
it's either, hey, the year this guy,

183
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:26,810
this is pure, or a woman who's pure
right from the job and you just,

184
00:10:26,811 --> 00:10:30,440
you're just all about creating. But
it's really just about, you know,

185
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:32,090
I was talking to shop about it,

186
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,920
that we were at the comedy store. We
were about to go on Sundays. I'm like,

187
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:39,500
how fun is killing killing's the most fun?

188
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:44,390
I don't understand how people
could quit this. He quit
doing comedy. Matt, how? How,

189
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,880
why would you quit?
I'm like got all the shit that I do.

190
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,040
If they said you could only do one,
I be like a comedy.

191
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,330
Everything else I could
just pretend I'm doing.

192
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,090
They know whether it's a UFC commentary,

193
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:59,030
I just sit at home and watch TV and just
talk about what someone's supposed to

194
00:10:59,031 --> 00:10:59,400
be.

195
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,900
You can't fake it. Right. Cafe comedy,
you can fake literally everything else.

196
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,510
Everything else.
You can't fake Kylen.

197
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:06,991
Yeah.

198
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:10,110
You and I can have the same fucking
conversation with probably would if there

199
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:14,310
was no cameras, no people. If you and
I would just chilling in the main room,

200
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:17,670
green room with the colonies store,
we probably have the same conversation.

201
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,810
Facts hundred percent. Yeah. But
when you go up there, that is a,

202
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,080
that is a precision art form that
requires calculation and also zen like

203
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:33,060
smoothness and Alpha flow.
You got to be in the zone.

204
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:35,910
You got to be in that flow state.
You gotta be happy,

205
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,970
but you also gotta be focused.
Yeah, that'd be having a good time.

206
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:41,280
But concentrating on these people and,

207
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:45,030
and projecting to them and you want
them to have a good time. You know,

208
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:48,570
the whole deal is one of the best things
about this job is you're making people

209
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:49,970
feel good. Yes. You're,

210
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,500
you're there coming out of their house
to see you and they come out of there

211
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:54,130
feeling

212
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,180
better. They have a good time.
Yeah. If everything goes right,

213
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,270
they feel better. They, in my mom,

214
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:04,540
my mom said the exact same things that
you're very lucky you get to make people

215
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,740
feel good for a living ethical job.
Yes.

216
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,500
Like how rare is that imagining he's like
insurance guys as to like tell people

217
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,860
they can't get their bills paid from
their car accident because it was their

218
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:16,330
fault.
Or imagine if you like,

219
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:20,350
oh one of those big tobacco guys you
driving around or Rolls Royce knowing that

220
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,160
someone's on an iron lung somewhere.
Someone's, there's the lighter

221
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,300
knowing someone's drowning in their
own fluid. Yeah. You feel like shit,

222
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,280
I need to just fly me to noon.

223
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,100
Let me play among the stars.

224
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,560
It's like is bullfighting.
Yeah, that's what we do.

225
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,170
It's somebody said it so well he's like,

226
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,350
cause people used to always make the
boxing analogy and I hated that because I

227
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:52,351
used to box a little bit and like I
never at all felt that it was similar.

228
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,140
Like I've never heard a boxer go,
yeah this is just like stand up.

229
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,240
It is like a martial art in
that the truth is what works.

230
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,023
I'll go on that

231
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,180
because in martial arts if you like
the in particularly in martial arts,

232
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,910
not just in boxing,
boxing is a martial art,

233
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,250
but the only stuff that works
is the stuff that works.

234
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,650
And if you hit a guy and he goes
unconscious, it doesn't matter.

235
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,620
One of the things that I used to like
about fighting was that everybody could

236
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:22,170
hate me and I didn't care.
I didn't care.

237
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:25,200
Because when I got in there and I'm like,

238
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:27,300
I knew that I was going
to fuck that guy up.

239
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,190
It doesn't matter what his friend's thing.
It doesn't matter how loud,

240
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,770
loud his parents cheer.

241
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,160
I'm going to kick that dude and his head
and I'm going to separate him from his

242
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:38,730
consciousness Taco and that's just going
to happen and there's nothing you can

243
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:40,230
hate me all day long.
It doesn't matter.

244
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,250
But then I had to switch gears 100%
into comedy and I thought there were so

245
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:45,030
different.

246
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,390
And then I realized because in comedy
you have to get the people to like you,

247
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,360
right? You can't just have
these ideas and be unlikable.

248
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,650
Can't you get them to respect you?
But they got to like you. They,

249
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:58,830
I mean you can get them to respect me.
Even respect is liking you.

250
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,970
Like do you have to be,

251
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,290
someone could say one thing like there's
like the late great Brody Stevens who

252
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:08,880
just passed. If you looked
at Brody's material on paper,

253
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,420
some of it wasn't funny and when
you looked at it in real life,

254
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:15,960
it was some of my best material
that I ever saw anybody do. Right.

255
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:20,961
Because Brody's personality was so likable
and he was so funny on stage that you

256
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:26,400
just wanted to laugh at him. It
just, he figured out that, yeah,

257
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,390
it's, yeah, and when I was starting out,
I didn't have that. I was, I couldn't,

258
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,440
I didn't, I had a hard time making
that switch. Then once I get better,

259
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,920
I got better at standup. I
realize like, oh there's,

260
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,930
it's so similar because either it's funny
or it's not funny take either it works

261
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,650
or doesn't work and your job
is not like some comics get,

262
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,840
they get caught up in their image,

263
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,740
they get caught up in how they
want the audience to think of them

264
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,330
and they dress a certain way on purpose
because they want to project this image.

265
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,940
And they'll even say things on stage
that are kind of gross that they're the

266
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,320
only saying it because they want the
audience to think they're cool. Right.

267
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,090
And it gives you a little like ill,

268
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,380
but maybe they're good enough so
that you seal lad everybody, Eh, cds,

269
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,140
authenticity, illuminates all those
comics can't follow a real comic. Right.

270
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,720
Did you ever notice that when you
see someone who's being truthful,

271
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:22,370
he might not even be as funny,
he might not be killing as hard,

272
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,960
but it's so authentic that when the
comic comes next it feels like they're

273
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,880
reading jokes off a
paper. Right. And it's,

274
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,300
our bodies are keyed into like comedies
reptilian if you do it right. Right.

275
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,880
You know like a lot of times
people will ask like why?

276
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:40,850
Like old women can laugh at the
same jokes that I'm telling it.

277
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,330
Like these young people can laugh
at and then my response is always,

278
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:48,110
it's not their choice. Like I'm not
telling you jokes to your choice.

279
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:52,130
Like the daily show, Trevor Noah is
jokes about how you want the world to be.

280
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,700
I'm telling you jokes about how you
deep down feeling is going at your gut.

281
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,270
It's reptile shit.
So it's like if it's in here already,

282
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,550
you're going to laugh for girls,
how old you are,

283
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,430
regardless of how you were raised.
This is how you feel.

284
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,620
And I think it's why you guys love 'em
Diaz so much. Do you know what I mean?

285
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:16,790
It's like he doesn't happen to
how to not be himself. He's like,

286
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,010
I like, he's like a, what is
he Latino? What kind of land?
He's a Cuban Larry David.

287
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,670
Do you know what I mean? It's just
like, like what does Larry David,

288
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:30,080
the whole show is what if someone
was authentic 24 hours a day?

289
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,620
What was Patrice raw authenticity 24
hours a day and we're drawn to that in its

290
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,590
worst form and it's best for them,

291
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,790
but we're fucking drawn to that and like
there's something beautiful that that,

292
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,540
that's why I always use
the bullfighter analogy.

293
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:48,710
It's like the bull for me is the premise.

294
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,770
It's not the crowd.
The crowd is still the crowd.

295
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:57,190
It's like how close can I get to this
dangerous premise and I don't want to box

296
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:59,210
with it.
I want to dance with it.

297
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,220
I want it to put his nose up against
my nose and then I want to secure it,

298
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,690
but before I skewer it,

299
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,410
I want to fucking do that shit where I
click my heels and I do the Little Cape

300
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,250
and I'm going to entertain the fuck
out of the crowd with this dangerous

301
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,660
substance. That's what the fuck we
do. That's why we roll our eyes.

302
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,810
When we see the pandering shit, we're
like, what are you wasting this for?

303
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:25,880
Exactly the fucking superpower. Well, I
think we're in this weird time period.

304
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:29,630
You know there's an ebb and a flow to
comedy and right now it's the weirdest

305
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,870
airb because right now you have
this weird comedy that it's,

306
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,830
people are saying things that they want
the crowd to here rather than saying

307
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:44,090
things that are funny.

308
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,010
They're saying things to hit all these
check points of progressive thinking as

309
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,920
cis white male,
I believe.

310
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,540
I don't say that word to me.

311
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,130
I mean it's like shit ain't real.
It's not real.

312
00:17:58,131 --> 00:18:01,440
Like the special I have on now is
called views from the sis. Yeah.

313
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,660
It's a playoff of Drake album
called views from the six.

314
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,770
But the idea is just like, yeah, he's
a straight guy views. Yeah. Yeah.

315
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,730
This is what the world needs right now.
Well,

316
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,370
you know the world needs authenticity.

317
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,510
Whether it's authenticity from a trans
person or authenticity from a straight

318
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:20,060
guy, the world needs someone to go
out there and say what the fuck?

319
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:21,190
They really thinking have a,

320
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:25,260
a well measured take on things and
that's what I see you're doing.

321
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,020
What you're doing is you're,
you're going out there,

322
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:31,670
you're expressing yourself and the great
thing about being turned down by all

323
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,220
these platforms as they can't censor
you. Yes. They're not going to tell you,

324
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:38,820
hey Andrew, we really like you, but um,

325
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,290
tranny we can't have tran. You
can't say that on our, no, why not?

326
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,360
Well, I was like, how come you can say
cabby but you can't say tranny. Granny.

327
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:53,730
Granny joke I have is transgender
training grandmother. Granny. It's,

328
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:58,660
yeah. How is this bad? Right out. What is
happening? We see it's kind of cute bro.

329
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,160
It's, we do it out of love. Yeah.

330
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,760
If we shorten something and add a y,
it's affectionate sort of.

331
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,750
What's not.
Uh,

332
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,520
if you pull your me talking shit
to someone to call him shorty.

333
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,490
Hey fucking shorty ready? Yeah.
That's longer shorty as longer.

334
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,360
Yeah. That's why Blackie's
wrong. Right, right.

335
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,470
So it's like this, the logic
is there is in trouble. Right?

336
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,910
SORTA Japs. What about
it? That's not good.

337
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,380
But Japanese cute Jap Jews.

338
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:38,310
He's talking about Japanese
people. Oh, calm the Japs first.

339
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,120
Yeah. Why is that bad? Well,

340
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:45,720
it's bad because that's how the soldiers
used to talk about them and the people

341
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:48,540
just talk about them during World War
II when they were at war with them.

342
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,260
So here's my question. What if
somebody was like, you know,

343
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:54,660
as one of the most refined cultures
and delicious cuisine that I've ever

344
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:58,980
experienced these jobs.
That's right. That,

345
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,210
you know, dance is the best. The spics,

346
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,940
these beats we dancing,
probably disagree with that.

347
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:12,720
Can fucking dance. Isn't
it intention, right?

348
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:17,640
Like is it 10? Yes. So I was
talking to this, there was a,

349
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,980
there,
there was a,

350
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,040
there's a trans chick that got upset
at the joke and she was like, you know,

351
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,470
she basically said to me,
she's like, how you know,

352
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,410
you probably wouldn't like it to if
as you were walking home at night,

353
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:31,710
someone called you trainee and then
threw a bottle at you. And I was like,

354
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,080
I'm out.
Respond to the negative comments.

355
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:37,830
But all I'm thinking is if you were
walking home at night and someone said

356
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:40,890
transgender and then
threw a bottle at shoe,

357
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,400
I think it'd be equally
upsetting. Yeah, right.

358
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,190
It's not what the word is.
It's like there are certain

359
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,560
words that are made to make you feel bad.

360
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,660
The n word is made specifically to
make you feel that you're a black cat.

361
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,410
Liked using it with your friends.
Right. And even then it is like,

362
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:00,610
you can use it however you want,

363
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:03,910
but the designation of the
word right is to make you feel,

364
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:07,270
but that's what it's designed for.
That's what it made up for.

365
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,740
But I think black people have successfully
taken a word that was negative and

366
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:15,700
empowered. Sure. To the point
where it's laughing fun.

367
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,950
Absolutely good times and bad times.

368
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,640
And you could use to describe
a powerful person. Yeah.

369
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,790
You'd use to describe an amazing
artist. An amazing athlete. Yeah.

370
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,160
Use it as a, yeah, it is the most
fluid word. It's unbelievable.

371
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:34,680
It's an incredible word in terms of
like its ability to be used on in all,

372
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:40,000
it's almost like the word fuck,
right? Like do you can stub your tone?

373
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,780
Fuck.
Or You could see a Ferrari go fuck yeah.

374
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:48,600
Do you know in Brazilian it's the
word com they use for that man. Why?

375
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,540
Yeah, it's whole. Huh? Paul
Ha. Okay. So like, you know,

376
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,840
like someone will catch a guy
in a choke and I go, Paul, hi.

377
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,940
Like that's a good thing. Or You fuck up
yourself, you're like, ah, Paul, hi. Yeah,

378
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,730
my keys Spanish and say [inaudible],

379
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,500
which means like mother
bitch and it's like a good,

380
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:08,410
it could be a good thing pulled Ahmad
they deal. But that makes sense.

381
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:12,610
Like mother, bitch, goddammit. But
come doesn't even make any sense.

382
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,590
Like I was trying to put my feeling of it.

383
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,530
When you come it's like
that is the sensation.

384
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:21,310
Like that was so good watching you
do that almost felt like me. Nothing.

385
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,860
And it could be bad in that like you Dick
Trick Gia and the fucking this girl he

386
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:30,040
been trying to avoid and then you come
and you'll be doing that is there's

387
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,640
regret.
What I did everybody,

388
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,830
but women will never understand post
nuts syndrome a syndrome because this is

389
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:41,350
something exclusive to us. Like I
don't know. I like you until I come.

390
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,270
That's true. Right? Yeah. Do not know
it's, and that's why it's so fucked up.

391
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:49,570
Like when you know women think we're fuck
boys who were pieces of shit is dudes.

392
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:52,790
It's like you don't get it.
I think I like you. Right.

393
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,510
Everything I'm saying to you, I
believe in my deck is just saying, man,

394
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,800
we're going to find out what we,
let's see.

395
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,360
And there are times where you
not and it's like, Damn. Yeah,

396
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,500
you realize you've made a mistake.

397
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,820
Especially if the woman is really into
you and you're really not into her and

398
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:13,660
you're like, oh, I made an error and
then you do feel like an asshole. Yeah.

399
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,420
But if you say that to them, they're
like, yeah, fucking asshole. I'm like,

400
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,930
I'm just being honest with you.
I got tricked by genetics. Yeah.

401
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,140
Why can't that be my biology?
Why can't I feel so for women,

402
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,050
you let me explain what this
is like. Yeah, you have this,

403
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,930
it's like finding out your guy was poor.
This is what it's like.

404
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:33,250
This is how I'd describe it.
Having an erection and getting excited.

405
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,970
It's like sitting in the backseat
of a really long bus. Okay?

406
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:39,070
And there's some other guy
up there driving the bus.

407
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,890
Most of the time you're driving
the bus now when your Dick is hard,

408
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,060
when you're dick is hard.

409
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,980
There's some other guy driving the
bus and all the windows are rolled

410
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,870
down. There's papers flying around the
horns honking time and you look at it,

411
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:54,380
life taking place through a
dirty windshield a hundred
feet away from you and

412
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:54,651
you're like,

413
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:59,651
do you even know where the fuck they're
going past the stop and your Dick's

414
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:03,110
like, just shut the fuck up
and calm down. I got this.

415
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,090
And then when you come,

416
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,010
all of a sudden the fog parts and you're
at the front of the bus holding the

417
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:14,870
wheel and you're like, what? What am I
doing here? How do they get here? Ah,

418
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,560
and you look down at your Dick, you mother
fucker, Bro. It's, it's being a werewolf.

419
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,880
Yeah,
it is being aware of,

420
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,580
right? Isn't that what, this is a
metaphor for this ravenous creature.

421
00:24:23,581 --> 00:24:26,370
You're running around doing crazy shit
and then you wake up in the morning naked.

422
00:24:26,371 --> 00:24:26,420
Yeah.

423
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:31,130
You're terrified. Covered
in blood. Yeah. Well fuck.
Sometimes. Sometimes God dammit.

424
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,230
What did I do? What did I do? Well, I've
got to turn myself in. Yeah, it's uh,

425
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,700
it's terrible. But that's one
of the reasons why, you know,

426
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,730
it's so hilarious when you see someone
who is a stereotypical male feminist

427
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,410
cause you know they barely have enough
testosterone to keep their heart beating

428
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,060
and they probably don't get post nuts
syndrome cause they just want everyone to

429
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:59,420
love them.
And they're in this weird state of,

430
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,590
you know Benedict Arnold
there being a gender traitor.

431
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,240
I mean it's really what's going on.
It's a lot of what it is.

432
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,860
There are men that want women
to be valued and see men.

433
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,360
There's men that want
women to have all the same,

434
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,560
all the same opportunities
and a quality and they want,

435
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:22,940
they want to value them as human beings.
And that's all real though. That is real.

436
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:28,060
But there's way more sneaky week fucks
that are pretending they think like this

437
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,470
because they know that women go, good,
good. You're on our side, you're an ally.

438
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,140
Come over here,
ally here in male ally.

439
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,440
And there are always these like weasely
little dude's with tiny hands and oh,

440
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:43,130
even if they're big,
they're like,

441
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:45,410
they're awkward and they've
had a hard time with women

442
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,830
and so they just shit on these men who
they feel they're in competition with.

443
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,540
It's a complete hater mood.

444
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,570
Absolutely. You've seen everything.
You see it in comedy. It's like, oh,

445
00:25:56,571 --> 00:26:00,500
I can't do that type of comedy so I'm
going to make that comedy radioactive.

446
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,880
This is the only type of comedy that to
loud. Yeah. You know what I'm saying?

447
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,490
Hey that comedy is so for example,
like it doesn't have to be coffee.

448
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,030
It could really be any kind of situation.

449
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:14,930
It's like you're just trying to carve
out the market share, right? You're like,

450
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,280
Ooh, that Comey is dirty.
That's edgy, that's sexist,
bigoted sensor it sensor it.

451
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,460
All that's saying is I don't want to
compete with pussy with those guys.

452
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,541
It's a little bit of that,

453
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,270
but it's also like the same thing you
see with the right versus the left.

454
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,090
Like there's a lot of people
online from each side.

455
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,780
We want to censor the opinions
of the other people. For sure.

456
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,260
Instead of having a better opinion, that's
a punch. Shut that opinion off. Exactly.

457
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,140
Yeah. So it's like, and when
they don't have a better opinion,

458
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,170
they just make you radioactive so
they don't even have to talk to you,

459
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,480
your races. Hey Joe Rogan, you're
racist. You know, what do you mean?

460
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:48,110
Let's talk about, and you're
like, I don't talk to races. Ooh,

461
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,340
that was clever what you did.
You see what I'm saying?

462
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,060
I went through that like the second I had
an opinion that went against the grain

463
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,501
immediately.

464
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:58,500
I'm labeled as something that they
don't even have to have a dialogue with.

465
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,040
Right. They just shut you down. Well, oh,
you're a white supremacist. Exactly. Oh,

466
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:05,470
you're all right. Oh, you're this,
you're that. Yeah. It's, it's,

467
00:27:05,471 --> 00:27:08,940
it's a simple week way
to end a conversation,

468
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,330
but all it does is it only works.
It's like,

469
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,220
it's like a magic trick.

470
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,250
It only works if you don't know
what they're trying to do. So how,

471
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:21,180
what percentage of the population
knows it? Right. That's,

472
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,290
that's a question I've been trying
to wrap my head around is like,

473
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:28,020
like you and I can sit here
and and see this all day,

474
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:32,610
but I think most people are seeking
confirmation, not information. Right?

475
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,940
I most people like they start out
their day going, I feel this way.

476
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:37,800
It could be right, left
central, it doesn't matter.

477
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,880
And then they're seeking out information
that confirms that. Right. You know what,

478
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:44,760
there's a parallel to that with what we
were talking about with standup comedy

479
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:45,594
and your career.

480
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,530
Because the reason why those people
seek out confirmation rather than

481
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:52,650
information, it's because they're
insecure. They're not at a good place.

482
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,700
But once you're in a good place,
like everything feels good.

483
00:27:56,701 --> 00:28:00,030
Like say if you're in a good relationship
and you know you have a good woman in

484
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:02,730
your life and you're happy
and everything's going well,

485
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,970
then you see a lot of things for what
they are versus if you're in the hunt,

486
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:11,250
you're trying to get people to love you.
You know what I mean?

487
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:15,720
You don't have any exits. It's like,
I mean this is a weird segue to it,

488
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:18,420
but like I, I tried mom, I've
never did a lot of drugs,

489
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:21,030
but I tried Molly at
Bernie man, right? And um,

490
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,110
it was the first time that I experienced
maybe outside of like comedy,

491
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:28,700
but first time I experienced having
like extra love. Yeah. Right?

492
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,010
So instead of operating on a deficit
and like trying to make you laugh,

493
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,890
so I filled a void or like trying
to say something interesting.

494
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:38,490
So I fill the void,
I had extra and what I did with the extra,

495
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:42,840
without even realizing it is I called
my closest friends and my parents and I

496
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:45,510
just told them how special they were.
Now,

497
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:49,950
I didn't realize that until years later
that that's what you do with excess.

498
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,840
Right? So how do I get to
excess without drugs? Right?

499
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:01,290
The question for me was also how do I
find fulfillment in shit that is not in

500
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:03,720
other people's hands so much?
Like when we,

501
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:04,980
when we were talking to the comedy store,

502
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:09,210
like what I fucking love about the La
scene right now is that comics have

503
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:10,500
control of it,
right?

504
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,640
So it's like comics are pushing the
comedy culture right now and it's because

505
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:16,800
they're empowered.
You guys have money,

506
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,670
you guys have sustainability
with your fans. You're not going,

507
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,560
how am I going to get another
pilot with comedy central?

508
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,250
Am I going to get somebody to get here?
Of course, when the industry ran it,

509
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:28,980
comedy sucked. You guys were talking
about fucking unicycles and Shit, right?

510
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:32,520
And that's why, and that's why no,
it's true. And, and, and, and look,

511
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,360
we would come out from New York and
we would come out and we'd be kind of

512
00:29:36,361 --> 00:29:38,280
disillusioned at the
comedy scene back here.

513
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:41,160
And maybe that was like some New York,
west coast, east coast beef or whatever.

514
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:41,980
And,

515
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,300
but what's funny is how to ecosystem
always balances itself because as soft as

516
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:51,280
comedy was out here, all the sudden an
ad a nowhere does show called roast.

517
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:56,050
Battle pops up is the hardest show
to heart the artist show, bro.

518
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,030
Like wild, insane. But
here's a perfect example.

519
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:04,240
Comedy central took that
and they have watered it.

520
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:09,330
Cut It like they would sell cocaine.
Yeah. But you're not getting a pure no,

521
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,130
you from Colombia. Not even remotely.
They took all the juicy stuff out,

522
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,360
the authenticity right up, but
it was real for a minute. Can Go.

523
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:21,361
They're still on Tuesday night and that
place gets fucking while I get sad.

524
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,610
What do you mean feel sad for some
people that get toasted up there?

525
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:29,290
I saw a joke. There was some kid
who's not retarded, but what is it?

526
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,530
A cerebral palsy. Yeah. Yeah.

527
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,610
And um, and, and he's up there with
his palsy and the other guy goes, ah.

528
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,460
He goes, he goes, you look
like your arms drew your legs.

529
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:40,843
Oh,

530
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:50,370
he's up there fucking shaking.
Oh fuck. Oh my God. He said,

531
00:30:50,371 --> 00:30:52,870
he just puts your body in a blender.
No,

532
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:55,870
he looks like someone put your
Voodoo doll and a blender. Oh my God.

533
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,700
I was so ruthless. But that's what it
needed to balance the system. Right. Well,

534
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,150
it definitely helped. You know,
there's a bunch of factors,

535
00:31:04,151 --> 00:31:07,120
but what roast battle is,
first of all, there's,

536
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:12,190
there's good things and bad things
about, first of all, Brian Moses,

537
00:31:12,191 --> 00:31:15,220
the guy who hosted it was one of the
nicest guys on the planet earth and that

538
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:19,120
helps. And then also he says, you
know, never gets physical end.

539
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:22,780
We all hug like this, good
in that course, you know?

540
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,690
And then when people go after each other,
like there's,

541
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,720
there's a guilty pleasure to
it that doesn't exist anymore.

542
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,400
It's like there's a guilty pleasure to
that kind of humor. It's very hard to get,

543
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:37,360
if you're a fan of that kind of
fucking vicious, awful comedy,

544
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,960
it's very difficult to get anymore cause
people don't roast each other anymore.

545
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,970
They're afraid,
they're afraid and they're soft like this.

546
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,880
Like these kids are soft man and it's,
we've got to stop blaming kids.

547
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:52,080
We just got to start blaming parents.
Like my parents were hard made,

548
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,430
my mom's immigrant, maybe
that's what it is, she Scottish.

549
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:56,140
But like my parents were tough.

550
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,460
Like my mom let me punch my brother in
the face once because he like pulled my

551
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:01,420
backpack or something.

552
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,720
Like I remember like he like pull
my back while I was like, mom,

553
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,430
he pulled my backpack. Can I
just punched him? She's like,

554
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:09,460
once she just let me punch him.
Right.

555
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:13,450
And it was like for her when she grew up,
that's what brothers did.

556
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,840
And like people always do.
You know,

557
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:19,300
I know you have some guys come on the
show and they talk about how like it's

558
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:22,810
happening at the college level. Like we're
entitling these kids and it's like, no,

559
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,310
he's happening in elementary
school is when these kids,

560
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,740
what have my boy,
Marco pointed this out to me.

561
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:33,040
Both his parents are teachers in Rhode
Island. He's like, what happens is these,

562
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,700
these fucking kids complain about
their teacher in school. Right.

563
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,060
And when you and I were in school,
our parents would go, well yeah,

564
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,590
sometimes you teach and are
like you so figure it out. Yeah.

565
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,150
And now these kids go, well mom dead.
The teacher doesn't like people.

566
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,650
Will that let's switch you out of this
school. Let's switch you your teacher.

567
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:52,970
Let's get your teacher fired.
So they start thinking the
world bends around them.

568
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,110
Right.
And then now to shit with the colleges,

569
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:59,300
it's like I can't get into USC
and say like, Oh don't worry.

570
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:04,160
We'll figure out how to get you into USC.
That fucking college thing is nuts,

571
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,980
but we'll, we'll get to that. Yeah.

572
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,890
I want to know what do you think
is the root of the softness?

573
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,910
Like what is the sheriff is why? What's
the shit? I know exactly what it is.

574
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,140
You know when a
power is taken,

575
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,020
it's not given. It's
taken. You have to take it.

576
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:25,920
You have to rip it out of somebody's
fucking hands. Power, right? Yup.

577
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,610
And after you take power out of someone's
hands, that's the last thing you take.

578
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,600
It's give, right? If you
have the right constitution,

579
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,110
you have the right constitution for power.
What have you done with your power?

580
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,370
You've uplifted a comedy scene.
You've,

581
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,000
you do shows where your host him at the
Improv, right? That's not for you, right?

582
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,230
That's where comedy,
okay.

583
00:33:47,231 --> 00:33:49,990
You're hosting shows that these
different places you can sell out arenas.

584
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,510
But you're choosing to
do shows in the city,

585
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,900
I'm assuming because you
understand the value of giving.

586
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,400
You're operating with excess

587
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,100
and but honestly the shows or
for me to work out to work out,

588
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,710
but you could do an hour. You don't
have to put other comics on it. Yeah,

589
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,731
that's true.
Yeah.

590
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:07,650
You don't have to say Schultes can
you come and do the show tonight?

591
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,340
You know what I mean? Like at the Improv
on Hollywood, which is sold out, sold out.

592
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,850
I was about to try to help promote and I
was like, does he need me to help this?

593
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,810
But it's like so,

594
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:19,620
so what happens is if you have
the right constitution for power,

595
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,550
you take and then you provide for your
people, you give back. It certainly helps.

596
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:28,680
It helps you too. People
don't realize like how helping
is addictive. Yeah. That's,

597
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,600
we can get to that in a
little bit, but like, yeah,

598
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:35,810
once you realize the value you get from
giving, as long as it's the right person,

599
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,310
yeah. Then you just can't wait. Yeah.

600
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:41,130
It's a trick and think that you should
keep it all to yourself because when you

601
00:34:41,131 --> 00:34:42,600
keep it all yourself,
you feel like shit,

602
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,750
you're a piece of shit and you become
that weird old miser that lives in the

603
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:49,260
mansion on the top of the hill and no one
could talk to him and you're miserable.

604
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,140
Yeah. And you can go anywhere. No, it's
a, and everybody looks at you like you're,

605
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,490
that guy has got all that money. I've
got to figure out how to get his money.

606
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,970
And you want to be, you want to be Ali.
Ali walks around in the neighborhood,

607
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:04,380
he wants, he's dead. But when he did no
security, now he can knock anybody out.

608
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:07,260
But at the same time, if he just goes, hey
guys, give me a second. I need a little,

609
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:10,140
and he was older and he could barely walk.
He would just go everywhere.

610
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,880
Anywhere you want. Love them because
they recognize, man, we want to follow,

611
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,390
but we want to follow the worthy.
So we'll test worthiness.

612
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,520
You know what I'm saying?
So what happened?

613
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:24,180
Why these kids are so soft
is the king takes power.

614
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,620
And then raises a bitch ass son
because he never had to take shit.

615
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,430
Right. And he doesn't want his son to
go through what he went through. Right.

616
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:35,610
He's like, you know how hard it was to
take his power? I'm, I got one foot,

617
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:39,480
you know what I mean? I lost a foot in a
power struggle and that is, this sun is,

618
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,060
everything's give it to them. It's
like the spoiled print and every movie.

619
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,620
You hate that fucking prince.

620
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,160
So I think the generation that's
raising kids right now, spoiled princes,

621
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,640
the generation before that,
Vietnam, you know what I'm saying?

622
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,040
Like being understood, sacrifice, war.

623
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,460
They understood the investment in the
country and then the generation that came

624
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:02,700
next, which is handed shit,
hey, everything's good. We're
not, oh, we're not going to,

625
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,360
whoa, wars just handled over there. I
don't want to get drafted. And it's like,

626
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,730
I almost think we should
all be part of it, bro.

627
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,770
It's like a regret of mine that I didn't
do some sort of service because it's

628
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:18,510
like how you complain at all about the
country that you didn't put your life on

629
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:21,430
life form. There's a lot of countries
that have mandatory service.

630
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,440
If they have extreme levels of patriotism
and investment like South Korea for

631
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:32,070
example, they took a uh, Don
Young Kim on, was it a yeah,

632
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,180
no. Who Was it? Samsung
Junge. That's who it was.

633
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,890
The Korean Zombie. That's
right. That's right.

634
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:45,610
He took him out of his prime and he had
to do two years of service in the Korean

635
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,580
army. These Robinson basketball player
had to do that navy time. Really?

636
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,670
I just yo like you understand cause we're
so detached and I don't hate on people

637
00:36:56,271 --> 00:36:59,820
for not realizing it because
we are detached as what we
do. Like little, you know,

638
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:04,220
some child slaves make iPhone and you
know, we were like, I just go, ah,

639
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,400
you can only really be connected to what's
in your world. Direct world. I'm cool.

640
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,090
That's life. It is what it is. There's
really no good or bad thing. She's are,

641
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,100
you know what I mean? So it's like
that's something we'll get to,

642
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:16,070
but it is what it is right there.
We're trying to do an ethical phone.

643
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:19,520
Remember that phone? What was that phone
call? And again, there were, there were,

644
00:37:19,521 --> 00:37:24,521
there were putting together
some ethical android phone man.

645
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:28,610
Come on. Fairphone yeah, that it
wasn't fair and nobody bought it.

646
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,960
Fuck that shit was expensive.
It's more expensive.

647
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,860
They have a fair phone to pull that
bitch up. Let's see what we got.

648
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,280
Let's see if it could fuck with,
so I'm trying to get off the apple tit.

649
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,340
I told you I got this galaxy note.
You come back row,

650
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,820
you're going to come back bro. Beautiful.
That screen is looking at this,

651
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,740
but this shit is always freezing.
The Pixel pixelated. True.

652
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:54,170
That's not true. Come
on Pat. This has a pen,

653
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,470
a modular phone that's built to last.
What does that mean?

654
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,230
But you can like attach it to it.

655
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,890
Fondants they're built to last so you can,

656
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,520
oh, that's gonna break.
Definitely not waterproof.

657
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,620
It says batteries. Those batteries replace
the battery. Yeah, that's ridiculous.

658
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:18,330
Remember when he used to be
able to replace batteries?

659
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,310
He's had hopped out
the back of your phone.

660
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Samsung galaxy like seven or some
shit. Removable battery. Android seven.

661
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:31,200
This motherfucker's got android nine.
You need to catch the fuck up. Naw, Bro.

662
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:35,950
What else? Fair materials. Look, there's
a white lady in the front. How fair.

663
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,970
Three black guys who were working for
what the fuck is fair about that picture?

664
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,500
If you're going to go fair materials,

665
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:46,270
how about you have white guys in their
fifties working in a factory and not

666
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:50,080
Chinese babies flush? Is this.

667
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:54,280
We have to acknowledge though that
like, do you know what I mean? Yo.

668
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,040
I mean make it fair.
Make all these people,

669
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,150
all these people who want to buy I
iPhones and you want to have your iPhone

670
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:02,800
built by some Asian slave.

671
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:08,020
How bout you work for a year and
upset the army you want to iPhone?

672
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,960
Put the time in,

673
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,520
but we should acknowledge that white
women really kind of our superheroes in

674
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:14,710
that way. White women. How so?

675
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:17,080
Because it's like they're the only
people who care about the environment.

676
00:39:17,081 --> 00:39:18,330
The only people who care about animals.

677
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:22,060
Only people who build wells in Africa
like they're really all my friend Justin

678
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:26,280
wren builds wells in the Congo.
He's a six foot three training.

679
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,080
He said he's a Bella tour. Fucking
top 10 heavyweight. Ask Him who's,

680
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:37,020
who do people helping him?
It's Rebecca. No, no, no, no.

681
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,260
It's got a lot of women
that you work for them.

682
00:39:39,261 --> 00:39:43,760
But a lot of men that worked for him too.
This is weird. Like women, they fucking,

683
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,410
they're getting it hard right now because
I think their tire coming at white men,

684
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:48,370
so they're looking for the next,

685
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:50,680
you know when the grease boil
and you got throw someone in it.

686
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,040
But like when you won't
talk about humanitarians,

687
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,410
like who gets fucked by more
races than white women. True.

688
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,500
Like this is really true.
True.

689
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:07,330
Except who gets the short end of the
stick there. Is that a penis size joke?

690
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,270
No.
Asian women and Asian men.

691
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:16,230
Asian men probably fuck
the smallest percentage of
different races in America at

692
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:22,180
least. I don't know how the rocket and
100%. Yeah. Yeah. They do the, yeah,

693
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:23,560
I think they have like some like Tinder,

694
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,860
they did something like Tinder study
that showed that that has a weird thing.

695
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,660
Yeah. Because to Asian women, no problem
at all. But uh, other ethnicities,

696
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,950
it's weird that it's not made
to size. Right. How so? Like,

697
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:40,380
like you would think that it's made to
sat like Lego tiny women would be into a

698
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,710
no, just like vagina would be like,
you know, I don't know. I've never,

699
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,710
I never thought that like Asian
pussy was that much smaller than like

700
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,170
studying, researching
chemical evidence, you know?

701
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:59,770
Well, you know, this doesn't
make 100% sense. Okay.

702
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,860
But I've met girls that were tiny
that you could not fuck hard enough.

703
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,550
Yeah. And it just opened up.
Yeah. But not, not just that.

704
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:13,000
It's just like they want it like
that. They want, they want savage,

705
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,930
they want to get fucking smashed.
Why?

706
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,150
Because I think they
realized that they are tiny.

707
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:23,350
They have small genes so they want to
get savaged genetics inside them so they

708
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:27,910
have survivor children. I really believe
that. I think it only makes sense.

709
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,930
Ah, some of the horniest girls irritated
in my life weigh about 104 lbs.

710
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,430
And these big brand that target
chicks want it real soft,

711
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,290
no nice Beta male.

712
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:39,770
They want to because they know that those
are the little girls are fucking giant

713
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:43,430
dudes making Doyle sites kid
and they get to keep going.

714
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,270
It's a never ending battle for
genetics, dude. It really is fun.

715
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:50,030
It's 100% it's a never
ending battle of genetics.

716
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:55,031
And if you deny girls fucking these like
Beta dude's may not did they do it for

717
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:58,730
a little while? They barely
fuck them. They always say
they have headaches. Listen,

718
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:02,990
I know a lot of Beta dudes, dudes
are headed. The girl does like,

719
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:07,670
I can't sleep.
They don't want to fuck the guys.

720
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:08,780
Dude.

721
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,710
I had a friend of mine who was dating a
guy like that when she was a really like

722
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:16,190
them. I just do not want to
fuck him. And I was like, wow,

723
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,440
cause why would you like that was rough.
I'm like, what are you going to do?

724
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,750
Don't fuck him, dude. It's it's
dude, it's insane, man. It's like,

725
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,650
I see this all the time,
like these like hardcore perceivably,

726
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:30,310
hardcore feminist chicks here.

727
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,410
My comedy could be the opposite of that.

728
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,880
And they're in the DMS, right?
Saying, I don't know why I'm here.

729
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:44,660
I swear to God. No, it's a trap house. She

730
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:47,190
could,

731
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:52,190
because I think feminism in general is
a direct result of a failure by men.

732
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:56,900
To be fair and by a failure by men,

733
00:42:56,901 --> 00:43:01,901
to be actual men and to raise actual men
who treat everybody with respect that

734
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:07,670
when men are abusing women, those men
are bullies. They're, they're weak men.

735
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,420
The kind of man that would do that to
a woman that would be like physically

736
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:13,550
abused,
a woman that's a weak man.

737
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,780
That's the type of man that would eat
up a smaller man or take someone from

738
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:20,870
someone with four. Since security needs
to feel powerful, he's a bitch. Yeah,

739
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:25,870
he's a bitch. Right? The antidote for that
is to be a strong man. Right? Like the,

740
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,060
one of the things I've been telling people
like this is how you fix bullying in

741
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:33,140
school. Teach them how to fight, not
the bullies. I mean, not just the,

742
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:36,680
not just the victims, but the bullies
themselves. Everyone had a fight.

743
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:39,800
When they feel confidence that they can
defend themselves and it will have two

744
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,600
nicest fucking people in the world.

745
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:45,860
Martial artists go to martial arts gyms,
go to a Jujitsu Gym,

746
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:50,480
I'll take you there. All fucking nicest
people hugging everybody in friendly.

747
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:54,200
Then they're going to choke each other
half to death and hell five minutes and

748
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:57,440
before that they're all
fun, happy, playful.

749
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,860
They're so secure and outside of their,
they're so secure and relaxed.

750
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,980
There are different type type of person,
obviously not all of them.

751
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,910
Maybe there's people over the most
part. Yeah, we vary wildly, right?

752
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,990
But almost always to a human.
The mean ones,

753
00:44:11,991 --> 00:44:15,250
whether it's mean women
or mean wet mailman, weak

754
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,860
women.
Women will tell you this,

755
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:22,520
that they work at an office and they've
got a female boss. That's a con.

756
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:27,350
That is one of the worst fucking cause.
You can't even fuck her. It was nothing.

757
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:30,710
You can do. Nothing you could
do to make that pitch happy.

758
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,950
She wants to take from you.
She wants to squeeze your blood it lease.

759
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,790
If you're cute and you're boss is
disgusting and he's a fucking asshole,

760
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:42,420
you could flirt with them a little bit
and you could like maybe get them to like

761
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:46,230
you more. Don't do it. Obviously
don't do that. But with a female boss,

762
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:50,490
you have to have a person to shit.
Shocking what the female boss,

763
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:54,090
not even that lot of women
don't like women. Right.

764
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,870
One of the things that I love more than
anything is when I talk to women and

765
00:44:57,871 --> 00:45:01,020
they'll do this thing where they look
around to make sure no one's looking,

766
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,930
no one's around. And I go, look,
I would never say this publicly,

767
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:08,530
but some bitches are fucking crazy.
That's what we do with like racist shit.

768
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,670
It didn't burn.

769
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:14,700
Have that bit about like when I look
around and then you slide the thing about

770
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:16,310
these.
Yes.

771
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:21,570
Well this women feel like they've got
momentum in this little war of ideas,

772
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:23,280
right.

773
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,090
With the me too movement and Bill Cosby
getting arrested and r Kelly getting

774
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:31,860
arrested and Harvey Weinstein. I, in my
opinion, and I bet you think there's too,

775
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,270
these are good things.
Yeah.

776
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,360
When shitty men get put away or they
get arrested for abusing people,

777
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,840
whether it's their physically abusing
men or physically abusing women,

778
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:46,400
it's always good. You shouldn't
be physically abusing it.
I'm out of here. Yeah,

779
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,243
to beat those guys up.

780
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,730
I mean this is handled in the community
when we were younger, teenagers,

781
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,330
a bottle of blood, you know, it was rough
with this, the whatever who was rough.

782
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:54,570
Right.

783
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:57,720
And we went over there and if you were
married and Harvey Weinstein tried to

784
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:01,260
fuck your wife and she went in on an
audition and you knew that there was all

785
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:01,870
these solar,

786
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:06,870
he guards and all these fucking levels
before you got to him and your wife got

787
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:10,170
into that level and he was treating
her like shit and being mean to her and

788
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:11,670
telling her if you want
to work in this town,

789
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,740
you've got to suck this little
fat Dick be, it's over Harry.

790
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,900
That's over angry. I'm
shocked. Like someone told it.

791
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,720
Didn't Brad Pitt try to step
to him or something like that?

792
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:23,250
Did step to him and did he swing on him?

793
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,880
I don't know what he did cause you got it.
Right.

794
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,410
Well that's the other thing is
fucked up about this is like

795
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,350
there's going to be Weinstein's. Yeah.
Like these people are going to exist.

796
00:46:33,351 --> 00:46:36,860
This man, they still exist. Yeah, they
still do it. Hearing about one last night,

797
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:39,100
someone was to,
I can't tell you cause I don't,

798
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:44,500
he's a television personality who is
apparently a closeted homosexual. Oh.

799
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:49,340
And he's out there and he's out there
like dude's yeah, just that home.

800
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:54,660
I don't know. He's trying really hard
and making them uncomfortable. Really?

801
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,210
Really? How? How well known. I don't know.

802
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,210
We'll talk later,
but what I'm saying,

803
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,680
go talk to him afterwards.
Crazy fuckers out there.

804
00:47:08,681 --> 00:47:12,910
There's still rolling it old school.
They want to get caught. Gwyneth Paltrow,

805
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,020
V's Brad Pitt threatened to kill Harvey
Weinstein. But you've got a swag on hand,

806
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,480
but you got to swing on him,
Bro. You gotta leave some marks?

807
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:23,530
I believe it so well it depends on what
Harvey did versus what if he grabbed her

808
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:26,370
and did anything to her physically,
then you got to swing on him.

809
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:30,000
But if he just said something creepy
and you tell, okay, then we have word

810
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,610
take your fucking life,
I'll take your life.

811
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:37,180
Well I think the issue with these things
is like we know we're going to have

812
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:41,170
Weinstein's but the people
that protected Weinstein,

813
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,700
like the second you complain about a guy
for grope in or doing something crazy

814
00:47:45,701 --> 00:47:50,100
right, that woman is doing exactly
what she's supposed to do, right?

815
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,030
She experienced some,
you know,

816
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,040
sexual assault and she's telling right
now if you silence her and shot her up,

817
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,500
that's where the system falls apart.
Right?

818
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:01,670
So whoever is protecting him throughout,
he got it. They got to go to right,

819
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,350
because she did exactly what
she was supposed to do. Right.

820
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,610
There's going to be Weinstein's throughout
life, unfortunately. A question.

821
00:48:09,611 --> 00:48:13,510
What about the support staff? All that
many people, all of them are almost,

822
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:14,980
they're not worse cause
they're not doing it,

823
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:20,100
but they're so bad because they stripped
the person who was assaulted from

824
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,260
like not only equality,
but like they stripped her from,

825
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,100
from life in a way like they
made that person go, oh shit.

826
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,610
Life isn't fair and I don't have a shot.

827
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,080
Do you know the expression
diffusion of responsibility? It's,

828
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,640
it comes when there's large groups
of people that watch something,

829
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:43,780
someone's going to step in. It's like
that lady, uh, Jenna vcs or something.

830
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:47,020
Remember that there was some woman who
was getting raped in queens and she was

831
00:48:47,021 --> 00:48:49,660
screaming for like 40 minutes and there
was all these neighbors around like,

832
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:53,170
yeah, I heard it, but I thought
Ted was on it. Oh Jesus,

833
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:57,040
you didn't hear about this thing, Katie,
Jenna vcs or some shit. It's an old story.

834
00:48:57,041 --> 00:49:00,890
But yet everybody was like,
oh, I'll get it. It's the
same kind of thing. It's like,

835
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,690
well, it's just how corporations work.
So if you're working for a corporation,

836
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:09,070
the Corporation's dumping pollutants into
the river, you know, you feel like, well,

837
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,490
it's not my responsibility. I just
work here in accounting. You know,

838
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,700
like somebody else is going to
handle this right now. This is,

839
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:16,781
and I think when you,

840
00:49:16,781 --> 00:49:20,260
if you're working in like the Weinstein
Company and you knew Harvey was out

841
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:22,000
there slinging Dick First of all,

842
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:27,070
and in their defense you probably
didn't know the specifics, right?

843
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,480
Because it's like, oh,
Harvey's a dog. He's always out
there trying to fuck. Yeah,

844
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:36,220
that's sort of normal. Like a lot
like people have to understand this.

845
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:39,610
Why does a guy like that get rich?

846
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,280
Why does it get rich as he
likes some patron of the arts?

847
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:47,140
Who loves creating Nabi? There's a
little bit, maybe he likes power.

848
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:49,270
If you like power,
why do you like that power?

849
00:49:49,271 --> 00:49:51,550
What are you getting out of that
power once you have a Ferrari,

850
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,700
once you have a Mercedes, once you
have a manager, what are you getting?

851
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:59,080
You're getting pussy, pussy, pussy.

852
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,020
So not even about the post side.
It's about power.

853
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:05,470
It's about power so much in a shit.
Like even these pedophiles,

854
00:50:05,471 --> 00:50:08,710
I don't even believe anybody's attracted
to kids. Well, they definitely are.

855
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,573
I don't believe it.

856
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:14,680
I believe they're attracted to power
and they're so wildly insecure that they

857
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:19,240
need to be looked at like a god and
children. When they look at you,

858
00:50:19,241 --> 00:50:21,550
somebody that they admire,
something they truly look up to,

859
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:23,200
etc. They can look at you in that.

860
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:27,010
God likes state and so I don't
think it's a physical thing.

861
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:28,130
Like I was watching that abducted

862
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:32,390
in plain sight. He, he gets
whacked off by the Dad. Right?

863
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,570
What? You didn't see this
abducted in plain sight, bro.
Oh my God. Well this guy,

864
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:40,770
this, this pedophile destroys the whole
family bro. He is to get to the daughter.

865
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:45,830
He fucks the mom and dad who
this is insane is Netflix.

866
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:52,820
Yes. You've never, and they sent their
comedy can imagine that. Imagine jumps,

867
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:57,510
they don't censor comedy though. They
don't need a damn censored mine, not you.

868
00:50:57,511 --> 00:50:59,930
You know what I'm saying there,
but it's like,

869
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,210
and what were the bad guys essentially,

870
00:51:01,211 --> 00:51:05,920
but like my point is that is a crazy
story. It's the dynamic of power.

871
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:10,060
Like, like people say the Catholic
Church makes these people pedophilia,

872
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,770
pedophiles. No, they have that
thirst for power and they're going,

873
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:19,771
who in my community has that amazing
power where they're looking at him as this

874
00:51:20,051 --> 00:51:23,200
godlike figure? Oh it was the
priest at our Catholic church.

875
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,260
That sounds like like like an evil choice.

876
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,860
Let me give you an alternative perspective
from psychologist cause a thing

877
00:51:28,861 --> 00:51:33,540
called imprinting that happens with
young men in particular sexually.

878
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:34,830
It happens with young women as well,

879
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:40,130
but one of the things that can happen
as young men can be sexually molested by

880
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:44,370
other men when they're young and
they developed this imprinting.

881
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,500
The vast majority of people who are
abusers were abused themselves. Right.

882
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:54,530
And there's some horrible hijacking
of the psychology of the person.

883
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,400
When you're a six year old boy and some
grown man has cock in your ass, there's,

884
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:02,790
there's something about that
that it fucks with their head,

885
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:06,660
especially if it happens a lot and it
becomes a part of your life and the guys

886
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:11,100
nice to you as well and buys you things
and does things for you and then you get

887
00:52:11,101 --> 00:52:14,100
older and you,
for whatever reason,

888
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,020
perpetrate this same har on other kids.
This is something that happens.

889
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,273
I don't know.

890
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:22,930
I think it's maybe, maybe it's
a combination of both, right?

891
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,240
Maybe you have that imprinting,
right?

892
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:29,170
And then it creates this massive
void that you need filled.

893
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:32,290
Like I think so much of
everything that we do,

894
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:34,480
everything that people do
is about filling the void.

895
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:39,230
And what is it that you need the
void filled with dictates off.

896
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,830
How often if you're evil,
sometimes if you're good,

897
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,220
there are some people that are
addicted to working out, right?

898
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:47,050
There's a void there they need to fill.
Some people are addicted to eating.

899
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,850
Those are the same addiction essentially.

900
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:54,010
But one is a lot better
to have than the other.

901
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,670
You know, it's like even with, I
mean there's even with Kanye, right?

902
00:52:57,671 --> 00:53:02,671
Like I see Kanye as like this guy who's
just wildly insecure and he's trying to

903
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:10,260
justify his coolness constantly by taking
things that are not cool at all and

904
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,580
making them cool within a community,
within his community. Right?

905
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,270
So it's like everything
Kanye does like down to like,

906
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:22,840
it started with like the wasp culture. I'm
going to take like preppy, New England,

907
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,800
you know, polos that are pink and
shit and I'm to make that cool.

908
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:29,100
Now before the hip hop community, I mean
I grew up in New York, we were like, Yo,

909
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:32,190
that's some gay shit bro. What the fuck
is that now? Kanya where's it's like, Nah,

910
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:35,540
you gotta look fly and this, these pink
waspy things in my Khakis, whatever.

911
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:38,290
Then he takes grunge
culture, right? There's fuck,

912
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:41,370
have you seen the bright that's ripped
sweaters and all that kind of shit.

913
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:44,250
That's Seattle Nirvana Shit. But
he's like, Yo, I bet I'm so cool.

914
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:49,010
I could make it cool. Right then it takes
dad sneakers. I'm so cool. I could Yo,

915
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:53,280
you think my community loves
cool sneakers. I'm gonna
make dad sneakers. Cool.

916
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:58,020
And then what is the most uncool
thing to his community? What Trump

917
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:01,140
and what does he try to make?
Cool.

918
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,240
It's selfish is all about him.
Oh,

919
00:54:06,241 --> 00:54:11,241
he cares is about proving that he's that
dude and he takes the most uncool thing

920
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:14,940
and puts it on his head and he's
like, Yo, I'm going to make mega cool.

921
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:18,000
And that's when people are like, at
least his community was like, Nah,

922
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:19,470
we're not gonna.
We're not going to play with that shit.

923
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,160
You know what I think?
I think uh,

924
00:54:22,161 --> 00:54:25,370
you know how like you have something
that's supposed to take like eight volts.

925
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,170
You have like a charger?
Yeah,

926
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,770
I supposed to take like when you go
to Europe and you plug it in, right?

927
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,920
Well like when you plug something into
the wall like we have alternating current,

928
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:36,730
like you could have something that
takes way more amperage. Right.

929
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:42,100
I think Kanye has the wrong
plug to the universe and in a,

930
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:47,060
in a good way without motherfuckers
getting like a hundred volts all the time.

931
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,730
So he wants to, do you
ever talk to him? No.

932
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:54,020
I talked to him on the phone and it was
a stream of consciousness that was so

933
00:54:54,021 --> 00:54:58,160
intense. I was like, okay, now I get it.
I kind of go, we had a long conversation.

934
00:54:58,161 --> 00:54:59,120
He's a very nice guy.

935
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:02,840
We had a long conversation for
like 1520 minutes on the phone,

936
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:05,390
which is a long conversation
these days on the phone. Yeah.

937
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,590
Blew the fuck talks on the phone anymore.
He does. Yeah, but you're at your thing.

938
00:55:09,591 --> 00:55:11,390
He's getting a hundred volts bro.

939
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:16,810
And he's got design going through his
head and new song lyrics and new fashion

940
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,560
and all this.

941
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:24,320
And I think he's just catching whatever
he can and holding onto it and waiting

942
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:27,290
through the waves to fill though.
But I don't know to fill,

943
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,780
there's a little bit of that.
But uh,

944
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:33,170
with him it's almost like affirming
that he's okay because he's so much

945
00:55:33,171 --> 00:55:37,120
different than everybody else. Like Elon
Musk, like a lot of other people. Sure.

946
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:41,030
What's up
when he used the confederate flag,

947
00:55:41,031 --> 00:55:45,010
do you know about his statements
on that? He, he said that like,

948
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,660
he used this in a quote.
What does he say? Oh,

949
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:49,730
react to how you want any
energy as good energy.

950
00:55:49,731 --> 00:55:52,130
That confederate flag
represented slavery in a way.

951
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,850
That's my abstract take on
what I know about it. Right.

952
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,000
So I wrote the song new slaves still
like the confederate flag and made it my

953
00:55:59,001 --> 00:56:03,560
flag. It's my flag. Now what are you
going to do? Not what are you going to do?

954
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:07,760
How can I take my equity
and see if I'm so dope?

955
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:12,880
But that's also his recognition that you
can take something like the n word and

956
00:56:13,281 --> 00:56:17,090
use it as a positive. You could
do anything. I mean, look, if,

957
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:20,990
if black people really decide,
I used to do this bit, okay, go.

958
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:24,130
I used to as bit about a two member when

959
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,700
the fucking duck dynasty guy was,

960
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:31,000
he was talking a lot of shit about gay
people. It's like I don't understand it.

961
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,730
I don't understand. And I was like, I
don't understand yellow cars. He's a shit.

962
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:40,360
If you understand why you wasting all
your time but you better be nice because I

963
00:56:40,361 --> 00:56:42,490
go,
if you keep fucking with gay people,

964
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,100
they're going to do something and they're
going to do something and you're not

965
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,060
going to be able to take it back.

966
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:50,200
Like what if gay people decided to
take over Cammo and the bit was like,

967
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:54,820
look what they did to the rainbow.
I go fucking own the rainbow. I go,

968
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:58,680
you can't wear a rainbow shirt anymore.
Everybody like bath.

969
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:03,180
They used to be leper cons and
pots of gold. Now it's dudes.

970
00:57:03,181 --> 00:57:04,720
But fucking I go off to it,

971
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,470
I have to do is start off
every gay porn in a duck blind.

972
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:14,600
Two dudes Cammo dynasty and he get the
gayest black guy in the world in camels.

973
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:19,960
Like some about duck hunting make me haul.

974
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:24,820
And some dude just drops in out of
nowhere and pulls his camel to sucking his

975
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:28,680
dick. If they just had all
porno in camera, it's it,

976
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,870
it would turn cam.

977
00:57:29,871 --> 00:57:34,600
I went to a gay thing and if black
people just just went whole hog on the

978
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:38,380
confederate flag, look at them. They
got Cammo wallpaper, son. Absolutely.

979
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:41,980
That's like some Annie
Liebowitz shit though. That's
like some vanity fair cover.

980
00:57:41,981 --> 00:57:46,610
Nonsense organized shoot.
Very Meta. Those are weird.

981
00:57:46,611 --> 00:57:48,490
Or what they're doing though. These
guys are smart. They are, by the way,

982
00:57:48,491 --> 00:57:52,870
that's a shit pattern. That's a
bad cammo pattern. All ducks ducks.

983
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:59,020
Maybe it's, there's, it might be their
pattern. I bet it is a swamp. It's like,

984
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,920
I dunno, the gay shit is like, you know,

985
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,160
it's not the climate for it and
I feel you. Oh, it could be.

986
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:11,080
Don't between remember deliverance squeal
like a pig. Yes. Yeah. But that was,

987
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:15,460
that was rape. Yay. Came rape.

988
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,790
It's not sex. It's about power.
Well then they didn't do it right,

989
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,140
but they also didn't get raped.

990
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,500
I mean powers of part of it for sure.
But they're just going to fuck you man.

991
00:58:32,501 --> 00:58:36,040
Fuck like this ain't sex bro. Just so
we're clear, bro. That guy is fucking you.

992
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:40,450
This is about sex and power. I get it.
You're not gay, but it's still suck.

993
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:44,200
People want it, man. That's the thing.
I don't know. I think the Kanye thing,

994
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:47,560
like he's just a guy who
thinks way different.

995
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:49,980
Like for whatever reasons,
the connections.

996
00:58:49,981 --> 00:58:53,110
That's one of the reasons why I think
this Kim Kardashian relationship works so

997
00:58:53,111 --> 00:58:53,944
well.
Okay.

998
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:58,980
There's cause like I bet she just handles
normal regular stuff and he could just

999
00:58:59,861 --> 00:59:04,740
be Kanye. You know what I mean? Like
it seems like they've disease people,

1000
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:08,500
different backgrounds,
different, no deaf, different,

1001
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:13,480
different telling me cause it's me
because the music is phenomenal outside of

1002
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:17,350
that. Okay. It's real simple. Have you
ever been locked up in a mental institute?

1003
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:21,960
No. He has. Yeah. They don't just lock
you up bro. They never locked me up. Yeah.

1004
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,900
You know my, my wife
never, I never came home.

1005
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:28,901
My wife has some fucking two gorillas
that are in those lab suits that are

1006
00:59:29,271 --> 00:59:31,590
staring at me. I'm like,
what's with the big guys? Oh,

1007
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:34,430
these big guys are going to take
you to a nice hospital. Like, sure,

1008
00:59:34,431 --> 00:59:38,460
we'd like to handle this quietly. What
the fuck? I'm not going with some hospital

1009
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:45,800
kicks Gel. Don't just go to the
mentalist too, bro. They fucking,

1010
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:50,270
they velcro. You put the mental tissue
doesn't mean that you are genius.

1011
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:53,110
There's a lot of crazy people who
had just crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1012
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,760
Well he's definitely crazy,
but he's also,

1013
00:59:55,850 --> 01:00:00,850
but he's brilliant to see the work that
comes out of that crazy is genius work.

1014
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:01,670
Right.

1015
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:06,590
So what is it about him that allows
him to be so prolific as an artist?

1016
01:00:06,591 --> 01:00:09,290
You ever notice how prolific he
is? Yes. You guys constantly,

1017
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:14,420
constantly banging out songs con and
there there's, he doesn't have bad albums.

1018
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,470
No, he's, he is phenomenal at music
without a doubt. Phenomenal. At music.

1019
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,620
This is all from this
energy that's inside of him.

1020
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,740
He figures out how to channel that
energy and put it in good ways,

1021
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:27,890
but occasionally, like it's not,
it's easy. It's not a coincidence.

1022
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,730
It's not a coincidence that
when Kanye was on stage,

1023
01:00:31,731 --> 01:00:35,120
I think it was in San Jose and
he said that he didn't vote,

1024
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:35,851
but if it was going to vote,

1025
01:00:35,851 --> 01:00:39,410
he would have voted for Trump and the
crowd went crazy and they booed the shit

1026
01:00:39,411 --> 01:00:42,380
out of him and then he canceled his
tour and then he went to demand mental

1027
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:43,214
health institute.

1028
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,030
All that shit happened together
because he felt the pain of this.

1029
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,850
Then his response to
that was to double down.

1030
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:53,800
His response to that was to attribute
qualities to Trump that he doesn't even

1031
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:57,170
really have and so Trump in his,

1032
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,700
in a lot of ways very wise,
the way he handles things socially,

1033
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:05,750
he let Kanye coming to the White House
where that Maggot hat and just ramped up

1034
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:09,200
a storm.
Kanye could define who Trump was.

1035
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,030
He could define what loving Trump meant.
You get defined why black people should,

1036
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,410
it should embrace Trump,
right?

1037
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,950
He could define all this and his head
to sort of justify what went wrong with

1038
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:19,580
him.
Right.

1039
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,880
And then Trump just sits there and goes
like this and let them talk and then he

1040
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:26,420
leaves. The Trump goes, what
the fuck is phone calls?

1041
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,140
It is or it's a pizza Dick.
Suck

1042
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,140
this shit right here.
That's it.

1043
01:01:33,141 --> 01:01:35,920
This is now look at that white lady
with her arms crossed in the background.

1044
01:01:35,921 --> 01:01:38,110
Like what in the fuck I need to know.

1045
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:41,260
Or like what the fuck am I watching faith?

1046
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:45,380
The blood check right there in the center.
Look at her face. She's like, okay.

1047
01:01:45,381 --> 01:01:49,220
What that's her face says okay,

1048
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:52,780
what Kanye is like showing
Donald Trump his phone to cut.

1049
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,220
Donald Trump's got his
lips pursed June phone.

1050
01:01:56,270 --> 01:02:00,130
Cushner show me some lyrics like a
devious smile and coasters phase.

1051
01:02:00,131 --> 01:02:02,900
Where dude up that dude.

1052
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:06,790
How about the black dude sitting there
like I can't believe I have to just

1053
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,060
face. He's like, what in the fuck
do I do when I get fired from here?

1054
01:02:14,061 --> 01:02:16,540
Cause I know it's coming.
I know it's coming.

1055
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:20,610
Oh it glad about the dude in the back
of the beard who get the brother in the

1056
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:25,290
back. He's like, man, you
gotta be fucking Shit. Me,

1057
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:29,550
Ryan Gosling with the boom
mic. Oh look at that guy. Yes.

1058
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,460
Manga all the way. He's like, Yay.

1059
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:37,461
I can't wait to get on Gab and talk about
this amazing meeting of the minds to

1060
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:40,530
look at his face. Who Trump
reached out to? You know,

1061
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:45,000
I'm friends with his son though. Like text
friends. Really? Yeah, he's a nice guy.

1062
01:02:45,001 --> 01:02:45,834
He's a hunter.

1063
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:49,950
We know each other through mutual
friends and one of our mutual friends who

1064
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:54,870
committed suicide. Oh Shit. So I was
like, no, but he's a nice guy. I mean,

1065
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:59,930
I don't agree with a lot of things that
a lot of people that I know agree with.

1066
01:03:00,091 --> 01:03:03,480
Yeah. I think, I think we're allowed to
be reasonable and cordial with each other.

1067
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:06,990
Yes. What's the matter? What
are you laughing at? What is it?

1068
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:10,560
Jim Brown was also
sitting at that luncheon.

1069
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,490
Let him let him know.

1070
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,730
Jim Brown used to do the early commentary
for the UFC. Really? Yeah, man.

1071
01:03:17,731 --> 01:03:20,970
He used to wear one of them Africa hats.
They're just like traditional African.

1072
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:24,600
Yeah. He was like, he
did my job for the UFC.

1073
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:28,590
Like UFC like one and two.
Are you see MMA savvy now?

1074
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:32,490
He's just a dude who knows
how to fuck people up. That's
true. He's Tim Brown man.

1075
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:37,800
Look at him now. The guy on his left,
uh, are left too. I left his bill.

1076
01:03:37,801 --> 01:03:41,850
Super Foot Wallace. That's a world
champion. Kickboxer from the 80s.

1077
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:46,780
He's a legend in the kickboxing world.
There is Jim Brown. I just started, uh,

1078
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,710
taking a couple of kickboxing classes,
kind of learn.

1079
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:52,590
You've got to get framed for
it. I used to box, right.

1080
01:03:52,591 --> 01:03:56,580
So it's like the most hum.
First of all,

1081
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:58,770
it's nice to have something to like,
want to get better at.

1082
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:03,510
That has nothing to do with career. That's
really fun and you know, but uh, the,

1083
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:07,860
the interesting thing about the
kicking aspect of it is, uh, when I,

1084
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,600
when I would see guys learning how to box,

1085
01:04:09,601 --> 01:04:12,940
like the hook is a tough
punt for people to get right.

1086
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,240
Because it's something you
almost have to kind of like pop,

1087
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:19,350
write it and people try to throw it
instead of let your body throw it.

1088
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:21,480
And that's who I am with kicks.

1089
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:27,090
I feel the like the exact same person
I've been trying to teach how to throw.

1090
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:31,200
It's just my body doesn't
want to let the legs go.

1091
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:36,210
Does that make sense? Yeah.
Yeah. I'm not sure whipping,
you know, uh, I can help you.

1092
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,920
Yeah. I used to teach re. Yeah,

1093
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:41,540
I see that you do a lot and I could
definitely help you with that. Yeah.

1094
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:45,110
You know what to think the way to do
it is you do it slow, right? Yeah.

1095
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:47,400
You do it slow and you don't
try to hit anything hard.

1096
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:48,840
When you try to hit things hard,

1097
01:04:48,841 --> 01:04:53,841
then you tense up and you like fucking
Herky Jerky and goofy and key to learning

1098
01:04:54,871 --> 01:04:58,790
how to kick ass to do it slow. Slow. It's
a big part of it. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh,

1099
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:03,660
you don't try to smash, you just try
to like get your torque. Right, right,

1100
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:07,260
right. Make sure you're pivoting
off your bottom foot, you know,

1101
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:10,650
the support foot as to pivot almost
with every kick basically. Yeah.

1102
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,840
Every kick your support,
foot pivots,

1103
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:16,440
support one is the one that
I'm just wondering, standing
on one, your stay. Yeah.

1104
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,830
That standing foot has to constantly
pivot. It has to go. You asked to be,

1105
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:24,700
you have to be planted. Right. But you
also have to be able to move with it.

1106
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:26,380
It's like a coordinated dance.

1107
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,950
That's why at timing and kicks is
so difficult because you got to,

1108
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:34,330
you got to time it and then you got to
twist your body and at the same time,

1109
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:38,140
but everything's got to work in
coordination. It's got to work in concert.

1110
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:39,040
It's such a cool,

1111
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:43,120
I think kickbox has gotta be the worst
marketed sport and the world. No,

1112
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:46,180
that's what I said.
It's the greatest sports to me.

1113
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:49,210
It's like for standout fighting.
Yeah. It's the best one.

1114
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:53,100
There's a company called glory and I've
been trying to Japanese one. No, no, no.

1115
01:05:53,101 --> 01:05:58,090
They were American or I'm sorry, from
the Netherlands. From Holland. Um,

1116
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,340
find out where they're from,
but they're international.

1117
01:06:00,341 --> 01:06:02,080
They do a lot of events here in America.
Right.

1118
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:07,230
But they're on UFC fight pass and I think
they're on ESPN two what headquarters

1119
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:10,690
are in Singapore? Singapore. Oh,
that's interesting. That's new.

1120
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,930
They might've got bought out.
Couldn't move there too. Okay.

1121
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:17,590
So we're trying to do some of the best
fucking fights you'll ever watch in your

1122
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:21,160
life. I watched it. I have
a, in my studio, in my gym,

1123
01:06:21,161 --> 01:06:24,040
I have apple TV and
I'll watch 'em glory on,

1124
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:29,100
it's like an app on UFC fight pass and
I'll watch it and some fucking amazing

1125
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:33,850
fights because people don't know because
Dana white has a really good point.

1126
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:38,680
In the 1980s with that bill super foot
walls guy was fighting. He was actually,

1127
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:39,281
before that,

1128
01:06:39,281 --> 01:06:43,960
he was in the late the seventies into
the 80s there was a thing called Pka

1129
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:47,290
karate and it was on
ESPN and it was terrible.

1130
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:52,500
And it was a kickboxers who are basically
like not the best kickers and not the

1131
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:57,430
best boxers. And then it was
like kind of goofy and clunky.

1132
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,470
There's a few guys like Rick,

1133
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:04,450
the Jet Rufus and some really popular
guys who were really good that we're also

1134
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,100
doing it at the same time, but for the
most part it was just terrible to watch.

1135
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,860
It was boring as fuck.
And then you'd watch boxing.

1136
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:15,220
It's he Mike Tyson at the same time.
So Mike Tyson's on TV,

1137
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:19,090
Marvin Hagler is on TV and you watch
these guys and these guys are like add a

1138
01:07:19,091 --> 01:07:23,600
shape and then so it tainted the, well
a little bit you're saying? Yeah, a lot.

1139
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:26,410
Yeah.
It's and Moitai for whatever reason.

1140
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,450
I mean you go to Moitai events and uh,

1141
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:34,990
they're rabid and it's like a very
deep community of people that really

1142
01:07:34,991 --> 01:07:36,680
understand and appreciate the sport.

1143
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,420
They'll play the Thai music and the
world of Mong Kong on their head,

1144
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:45,421
they bowed or their trainer by seven
rolling elbows and smashing again legs.

1145
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:50,030
And it's amazing to watch. Same thing.
Is kickboxing more or less moist?

1146
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,600
The hardest.
It's the hardest of all of them.

1147
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:57,130
More elite version of kickbox that
because it's elbows and knees and a lot of

1148
01:07:57,131 --> 01:08:00,550
clinch work and a lot of dumping where
they trip you and slammed me to the

1149
01:08:00,551 --> 01:08:03,920
ground and, and they kick you on
the way down to they'll, they'll,

1150
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:08,680
they'll throw you into the ropes and
if you're still on your way down,

1151
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:11,620
you get punted in the head. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, and it's legal.

1152
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,310
It's a hoard sport, man.
It's just part as it comes.

1153
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:19,730
You feel like we could
get people to get behind.

1154
01:08:19,731 --> 01:08:24,020
I mean even from you yet you'd have to
have some sort of an epic change in the

1155
01:08:24,021 --> 01:08:28,370
way we view things. But to me it's
way more exciting than football.

1156
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:32,030
Like if those football players
all decided to do Moitai,

1157
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:36,020
it would be better for their brains.
Right? Believe it or not, to be a fighter.

1158
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:40,220
And two, you would see these elite
athletes fucking smashing each others.

1159
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,350
Let's talk about the incredible,
I want to talk about,

1160
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:46,070
because I was talking to Brendan
about this and then a and Izzy, uh,

1161
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:50,600
is he came on one of my podcasts.
Um, and we were talking about when,

1162
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:55,160
when are the elites, Izzy,
uh, out of Sonia. Oh Yay. Yay.

1163
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:58,700
Style bender. Yeah. Style or [inaudible]
style. Then my guy, man, I love him.

1164
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:01,930
He's the, he's like east,
he's a perfect example of,

1165
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:06,790
of the style that is so fucking
exciting to watch. Shows his opponent.

1166
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:11,090
He's fighting this dude that's the Loom
Kelvin Gastelum who is one of the elite

1167
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:14,840
of the elite out there as
well. Strike Wrestler, Short,

1168
01:09:14,841 --> 01:09:18,050
stocky blasting, striker, good recipes.

1169
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:23,290
Whistleblowing these fucking
wrestlers in the world.

1170
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:25,250
They're tough as fuck.
But they have power. It's,

1171
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:29,930
it's a unique thing because sometimes the
Jujitsu guys don't have power with the

1172
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:31,790
hands.
When these wrestlers,

1173
01:09:31,791 --> 01:09:36,130
it seems like they all have power and I
was asking us and folks around in there

1174
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:39,620
like it's core everything.
Yeah,

1175
01:09:39,621 --> 01:09:43,670
some of them but like Ben ask who is
probably one of the best wrestlers in the

1176
01:09:43,671 --> 01:09:47,270
sport doesn't have any power in
that sense. Cause even try. Yeah,

1177
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,940
but he's just about getting you
to the ground fucking you up.

1178
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:53,990
He just has such unbelievable
confidence and he should,

1179
01:09:53,991 --> 01:09:57,380
he's undefeated in his wrestling
that he just concentrates on,

1180
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,040
absorbing whenever he can and grabbing,

1181
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:04,970
what is his w I mean like maybe I'm
just such a, you know, a Newbie to this,

1182
01:10:04,971 --> 01:10:08,420
but like I don't understand his,

1183
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:13,800
his leverage point. Like what
his, his skill, his, his,
his. He's so strong that his,

1184
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:18,680
is it his grip? Like what, what is he
doing? Physical strength. It's technique.

1185
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,800
It's an understanding of it.
You,

1186
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:24,170
you to think of wrestling the
same way you would think of chess.

1187
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,690
Like if you only know a few moves,

1188
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:30,920
you're not going to beat a guy who knows
all the moves. He knows all the moves.

1189
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:34,760
So once he's locked with
you, defend, you think, oh,

1190
01:10:34,761 --> 01:10:37,940
I'm going to stuff,
I'm going to dig in my hooks.

1191
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,520
I'm going to palm Mullander here
and I'm going to defend here.

1192
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:43,070
He knows you're going to do
that. So He's, he's shooting,

1193
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:47,180
waiting for you to Palmer as you're
palming, he's switching to the inside.

1194
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,770
He's tripping you.

1195
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:52,550
He's grabbing hold of your legs and it's
really awkward way he's rolling back

1196
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,790
because he knows your weight is going
to be going in a certain direction.

1197
01:10:55,970 --> 01:11:00,970
He's anticipating several steps ahead
and he has international wrestling

1198
01:11:01,371 --> 01:11:04,310
competition experience,
which is just next level.

1199
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:09,020
He's wrestling these guys from Russia and
Iran and some of the best wrestlers in

1200
01:11:09,021 --> 01:11:13,300
the world. He, there's levels to
this fucking thing and level Aa,

1201
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:14,610
his levels,

1202
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:17,730
but the same you could
say about style bender.

1203
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,150
See the thing about style bender
is he's an elite kickboxer.

1204
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:26,750
He lost the glory middleweight title and
a very controversial decision to Jason

1205
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:29,160
Wellness, who was one of the elite of the
elite, one of the best guys out there.

1206
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:34,161
So style bender competed at the highest
level of one of the most difficult

1207
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:39,741
combat sports in the world and in that
world he's known as a precision artist,

1208
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:43,410
right? That world. He's a
technician. He's not like,

1209
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:46,920
there's some guys that are just thugs.
They got a good low kick,

1210
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,880
they get a good shell,
they throw bombs that will in a bra.

1211
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,110
They know a few things.

1212
01:11:52,111 --> 01:11:55,800
They know how to pump the Double Jab and
lead and to get that inside leg kick in

1213
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:00,240
style benders a different animal.
He's switching stances on you.

1214
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:03,180
He's hitting you with upward elbows,
setting things up.

1215
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:06,780
I notice him with the faints.
Yeah, he fucks people up.

1216
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,400
There's a video of him.

1217
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:12,970
The one when he went into God mode that
I had on my Instagram that Lawrence

1218
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:16,670
Kenshoo broke down. Dude. He
fucks people up, man. Yeah, yeah.

1219
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:21,790
And he fucks people up in an artistic
way to the way he picks his shots.

1220
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:26,280
He just knows what you're going to do
before you know what you're going to do.

1221
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,570
And he has several steps.

1222
01:12:27,571 --> 01:12:32,310
So he has that same level of skill
that Ben Astron possesses in wrestling.

1223
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:36,780
He hasn't kickbox. What is more valuable
on in an openness is like right here,

1224
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:39,120
like you standing in front of this dude,
she's setting them up,

1225
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:42,690
looking for the moves with witness,
see how the guy responds,

1226
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:46,410
and then hit watch this Sam
Senate and then walks away.

1227
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:51,270
The walkaway Kao one of
the most devastating slash
psychological maneuvers of

1228
01:12:51,271 --> 01:12:53,790
all time.
He's a special guy,

1229
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:56,760
but there's no one thing that's better.

1230
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:02,060
That's the most effective form wrestling
because of the best wrestler can

1231
01:13:02,431 --> 01:13:04,230
dictate where the fight takes place.

1232
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,970
The best wrestler can get ahold of a
guy and dragged him down like Khabib,

1233
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:11,070
Norma Madoff, who might be
the best fighter in the world.

1234
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:14,010
He's the UFC lightweight champion.

1235
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:18,660
What stands out about him is that he can
get ahold of the guys and once he does,

1236
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:22,410
they can't do Jack Shit about it.
He's not the best striker in the world,

1237
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:25,140
but he's good enough. So you have
to be scared of him on the feet.

1238
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:28,950
Cause he dropped Conor McGregor. I mean
he's, he can tag you, he can fuck you up.

1239
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:30,420
He's got powers,
knock guys out.

1240
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:34,340
But more importantly that's to set up
the clench and then once he gets to the

1241
01:13:34,341 --> 01:13:37,140
clinch, your, his, that's
it. Then you go on far ride,

1242
01:13:37,141 --> 01:13:40,500
you're getting slammed and then you're
getting the fuck beaten out of you on the

1243
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:45,360
ground and you're getting strangled.
And that's just how it goes. But he has,

1244
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:50,850
he has the full skill package, like he
can strike with you. He can submit you,

1245
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:56,030
but his grappling is what allows that to
take place now with style bender style

1246
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:59,460
benders grappling allows him
to stay up on the feet. See,

1247
01:13:59,461 --> 01:14:03,510
he's a very good grappler in terms of his
ability to get back up and his ability

1248
01:14:03,511 --> 01:14:07,410
to stuff to take. He's got the
sprawl. Yeah. Not just sprawl,

1249
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:12,250
but he gets the fuck out of
there. He pushes your head
right. He pops his legs out

1250
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:16,990
and kicks back and then he punishes
you on the way out. Take that with you.

1251
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:18,960
Great distance.
It's a different,

1252
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:21,820
I noticed it's different like
with the sports and involve legs,

1253
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:26,420
but like you guys fight at a, at a, at
a further distance course. Yeah. Yeah.

1254
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,970
But it also makes you susceptible
for counters in a way. Like,

1255
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,670
like when,
when Connor was fighting Floyd,

1256
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:38,360
my biggest concern for Connor
was not speed or counterpunching.

1257
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:43,210
It was the distance that you're
going to be able to counter.

1258
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,750
And when, when Connor caught Floyd
Floyd a couple times in the beginning,

1259
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:48,440
I think one was the left
upper cut he called flood.

1260
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,640
That was shocking to me because I was
surprised that he had boxing counter

1261
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:59,320
punching speed. The
distance is half. Yeah.

1262
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:03,730
Compared to a Kingsport. Yeah. I
would say if we're standing what, two,

1263
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,630
three feet away from each other in
kickboxing, it's one and a half boxing.

1264
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:11,930
So to cut that distance in half and still
have the counterpunching ability was

1265
01:15:11,931 --> 01:15:13,630
impressive. Yeah. I mean,

1266
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:19,180
well he's done a lot of lower level
boxing and the gym stuff like that is when

1267
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,070
you get up to that level,
it's a different fucking game.

1268
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,370
Floyd Mayweather is on a completely
different planet than anybody else.

1269
01:15:24,371 --> 01:15:28,120
He's the greatest great of all time.
That's what I meaning like,

1270
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:33,040
I think he's better at boxing then
Stephen Hawking is at astrophysics. Ha,

1271
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:36,140
you might be right. Look,
he's 50 know the con.

1272
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,780
It does count even though
probably shouldn't, right?

1273
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,150
I mean it was a real boxing match,

1274
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:43,750
but it was a guy that had zero
professional boxing matches. Uh,

1275
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:46,620
but he did get tagged Connor,
Ken Punch. He's a good fighter.

1276
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:48,610
He's a very good mixed
martial arts fighter.

1277
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,150
But the thing about Floyd is that
Floyd is the best at not getting hit.

1278
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:56,170
No one's better. So I've been tagged,
really tagged like three times,

1279
01:15:56,171 --> 01:16:00,120
four times in his whole career. I can name
five times. It should be Shane Mosley,

1280
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:04,650
my Donna the end of the fourth round. Yup.
Um, the other ones are early. I'm Judah,

1281
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:08,440
right. Hook actually dropped him. Sam
shooter was a wicked man. It was great.

1282
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,370
His Dad was a kickbox. Yeah, that's
right. He came from that. A you uh,

1283
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:13,780
what does the name something something,
dude, I forget his name, but all guys,

1284
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:18,580
y'all do y'all do it? Yeah. And then,
uh, to Marcus Chop Chop quarterly. Oh,

1285
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:22,510
that's right. I forgot in them.
Oh yeah, that's right. It was, um,

1286
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,400
yeah, my, my pops is like a massive box
and Fannie, we still like go to Ollie's a,

1287
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:28,480
he was a journalist back in the day,

1288
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:31,390
used to cover like Ali and his fights and
so like, that's why I kind of came up,

1289
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:35,830
you know, generationally
watching boxing. So that's
awesome. Yeah, dude, it was like,

1290
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:39,010
I mean some of the best moments, you
know what else Floyd has going for him,

1291
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:44,011
that the best Jujitsu guys have going
for him is that he's not physically

1292
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:45,064
powerful.

1293
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:49,960
Like the best Jujitsu guys are smaller
people because the smaller people learn

1294
01:16:49,961 --> 01:16:52,690
how to use leverage and technique
and the camp muscle things.

1295
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:55,450
Whereas if you look a 250 pound gorilla,

1296
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:57,880
you're some good old football
player dude. And you're like, man,

1297
01:16:57,881 --> 01:17:01,930
I don't want words fuck Jujitsu. Like
you don't ever have to be on your back.

1298
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,270
Right. You know, like I was
talking to shab about Daca shops,

1299
01:17:04,271 --> 01:17:05,410
thinking about doing Jujitsu again,

1300
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,690
cause I was telling him I
got a back end to a recently.

1301
01:17:07,691 --> 01:17:10,040
I'm really enjoying it and
like, ah, I don't know. I

1302
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:13,850
go, just roll off your back man. Tell
him to be a big guy with a guard.

1303
01:17:13,851 --> 01:17:15,720
No big guys have gone.
It's so rare, right?

1304
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:19,970
Because big guys just get little guys
on the ground and they have a nasty top

1305
01:17:19,971 --> 01:17:23,510
game. But then when they find themselves
on their back, a lot of them are turtles.

1306
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:27,230
Ooh, they don't know what to
do. It's a technique thing.

1307
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:32,240
A little guy has to learn
perfect precision technique
because they don't have

1308
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:36,180
that extra size point guard in the NBA.
Floyd has we cans,

1309
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:40,820
he's broken his hands many times and
even though he's capable of knocking guys

1310
01:17:40,821 --> 01:17:42,560
out,
it's with precision.

1311
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:46,910
[inaudible] going to knock you out
like a John the beast Mugabi would or a

1312
01:17:46,911 --> 01:17:51,850
Francis and Ghana would or a
fucking a real power puncher.

1313
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:52,760
Joe Smith.

1314
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:57,350
There's guys who just fucking get you to
the cage or against the ropes had just

1315
01:17:57,351 --> 01:18:01,040
smash. Yeah, uncanny. Some
of these guys, it's just raw.

1316
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:04,410
Power's empty and it's, Yep, he,

1317
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:06,800
Floyd is all precision and he's all like,

1318
01:18:06,801 --> 01:18:11,000
one of the most fun things for me is
watching Floyd in the first round and

1319
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:13,460
watching him take away your life.

1320
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,500
Like I like to see him take away
a fighter's confidence. Right?

1321
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:23,180
Like he knew that Moseley was going to
get off with the jab, or at least he knew,

1322
01:18:23,181 --> 01:18:26,690
mostly thought that he was going to get
off with the jab. And there's a moment,

1323
01:18:26,691 --> 01:18:29,360
even in the first round, I know he
gets tagged with that overhand right,

1324
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:32,000
but there's a moment where Mosley,

1325
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:37,390
Mosley pops the Left Jab and Floyd sees
it steps back slightly and then come

1326
01:18:38,241 --> 01:18:40,670
straight over at the right.
In that moment,

1327
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:45,880
you could see Shane know that there's
nothing he can do because Floyd has time

1328
01:18:47,121 --> 01:18:50,600
the Jab and countered it directly.

1329
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:54,260
So now your job is done. Right now
I've locked off one of your arms.

1330
01:18:54,261 --> 01:18:56,930
I've literally just cut it off.
Now you've got to open up with the right.

1331
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:59,300
You're not going to do anything to
me. Just straight, right. I mean,

1332
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:00,740
I got the Philly shell.
It's over.

1333
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,390
It's like seeing him take pieces
away from a fighter. I just,

1334
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:10,040
I love fucking Floyd man. Well, he
learned how to apologize the age too,

1335
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:13,400
and his dad was a wizard.
His Dad when he was young,

1336
01:19:13,401 --> 01:19:16,580
fought sugar ray Leonard and of course
good fight when sugar was in his prime.

1337
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:19,580
Good pedigree. Men got some good
pedigree. They know how to do it.

1338
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:23,000
This smart fighters goals.
Roger Mayweather, Black Mamba.

1339
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:25,520
His brother was a motherfucker man.

1340
01:19:25,521 --> 01:19:29,360
I used to love watching his brother fight
back in the or is a, is a uncle rather.

1341
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:32,660
I used to love watches, uncle
fight. He would fight on like ABC,

1342
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:36,470
like whatever television shows were having
boxing on television during the day.

1343
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:40,160
Maybe it was ABC, I don't remember.
But yeah, he was like that family.

1344
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:43,880
He grew up boxing and he also got to
see the things that people do wrong,

1345
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,940
you know? And here's another thing
that Floyd has going for him.

1346
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,930
Conditioning on the unfathomed.
He's always in tremendous shape.

1347
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:54,320
Always just always in shape. I think
it's a hustle. When you see a meeting,

1348
01:19:54,321 --> 01:19:57,330
the mcdonalds and shit,
nothing saw that.

1349
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:01,850
You think regularly? 100%
yeah, you can eat that shit.

1350
01:20:01,851 --> 01:20:05,480
It's just carbohydrates. It's just
bullshit. The thing about that,

1351
01:20:05,481 --> 01:20:08,040
like either eating sugar,
like

1352
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,930
he'll drink a soda after a workout.

1353
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:13,350
He's working out for two and a half
hours and you can take some sugar, dude.

1354
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:14,810
Not only can you take some shit,

1355
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:19,170
there is an argument that that kind of
sugar is not bad for you after you have a

1356
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:23,190
brutal workout. Dude, when I was, when
we did this sober October challenge,

1357
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:28,020
man, dude already looked
phenomenal. Fucking funny. So
I'm in New York. I was like,

1358
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:31,200
Dude, you had ads are who was going
to be my biggest competition too.

1359
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:34,460
Cause he lists them on hired in his face.
Like his head is just exhausted. Yeah.

1360
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:39,230
He's like er, yeah. So door
to this bullshit. But his
body was fucking shredded.

1361
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:42,480
Shredded. Yeah. What is this head?
Johnson. He always eats McDonald's.

1362
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:46,410
He's doing while he's working
out right here. Yeah. Yeah Dude,

1363
01:20:46,411 --> 01:20:47,860
you can do that.
Yeah.

1364
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:52,010
It's all in how much you exercise
with them now that's not surely eat,

1365
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:57,120
go chat. Obviously he's eating
healthy food on top of that.

1366
01:20:57,390 --> 01:21:01,110
But if he feels like fucking off and
getting a big Mac, he could do that.

1367
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:06,240
And there's no, no performance benefit,
right? No, but no penalty. You can do it.

1368
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:10,170
So when Floyd does that, he is doing
that. Yeah. It really is eating that nuts.

1369
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,760
It's Chad still working
out. Yeah, he does.

1370
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,450
Just for exercise, just for fun. He
fucking loves it. 22 miles an hour.

1371
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:20,430
It's his comedy.
What does he do with this these days?

1372
01:21:20,431 --> 01:21:24,210
So what he'll do is he'll like play
guys and like play guys in FIFA online.

1373
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,850
He's a great follow on Twitter.
It's hilarious. Oh yeah. I follow.

1374
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,730
It's like hit like a girl.
We'll post a picture and then he'll say,

1375
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:32,970
what's wrong with the picture? It,
she'll be smoking high and be like, yeah,

1376
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:35,370
but your shades at $30. Like, you know,

1377
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,660
don't put so much money into your outfit
when the blinds in your house or $30.

1378
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:44,190
Like he'll just nit pick little things
like, dude, he's hilarious. But his, um,

1379
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:49,810
my guesstimation is, um, this is his
comedy, like remember you saying? Yeah.

1380
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:54,630
Yeah. He used to sleep at the arena
or at least at, at the stadium.

1381
01:21:55,470 --> 01:22:00,150
He, when he played, he was obsessed
with it. He loved the sport.

1382
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:03,960
He was talking about fighting Anderson
Silva at one time. No, no, no. He's crazy.

1383
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:06,960
He's talking about finance,
football player,

1384
01:22:06,961 --> 01:22:09,120
coffee Anderson when he was in his prime.

1385
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,750
I think he has martial arts skill though.
I'm not bullshitting.

1386
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:17,910
I saw South Pole is actually he's got
fined him hitting the pads are hitting the

1387
01:22:17,911 --> 01:22:22,110
bag cause I think he has real martial
arts skill like legit martial arts.

1388
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:22,731
But that's the question.

1389
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:25,670
It's like when are these elite
athletes going to enter MMA? Damn.

1390
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:29,370
Well they are but in small,
who's the small numbers?

1391
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:33,270
Well Jon Jones is absolutely an elite
athlete but he's got a 20 inch vertical.

1392
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:38,070
Uh Yeah.
How elite he did.

1393
01:22:38,071 --> 01:22:42,570
He's got small calves but the fact that
he has those small cows allows him to be

1394
01:22:42,571 --> 01:22:45,480
six foot four and 205 pounds.
Right.

1395
01:22:45,481 --> 01:22:48,920
You're saying if he was bottom heavy
he'd be to 50 he'd be a different weight,

1396
01:22:48,921 --> 01:22:52,260
which she could be,
but the way he could be a heavyweight,

1397
01:22:52,261 --> 01:22:53,970
he could bulk up and go up to heavyweight,

1398
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:58,350
but he's got like weird calf
genetics is calves are tiny. Right.

1399
01:22:58,351 --> 01:23:02,820
The thing is you don't have to jump that
much in MMA and he can hit you in the

1400
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:06,070
face with a flying knee.
But the what he

1401
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:10,390
knows how to do and what he
can do physically in terms
of his wrestling and his

1402
01:23:10,391 --> 01:23:15,010
ability to close the distance and smash
guys time people. He's an elite athlete.

1403
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:17,600
I think he could, he
could have done that. His,

1404
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:20,220
his two brothers play NFL here he is

1405
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:25,470
sparring a little bit.
He's in blue, right? Yeah.

1406
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:29,200
Still can't be touched. He
says, well he's a southpaw so

1407
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:35,530
let's see this
from Anderson Silva,

1408
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:42,850
so he's full. Okay. Oh it's
good. Good habits. Good head
movement. Yeah, for sure.

1409
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:46,480
I like the way it moves
hands down over ridiculous.

1410
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,380
See cause the duty sparring though,
we don't know shit about him.

1411
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:53,080
That guy might be terrible,
you know?

1412
01:23:53,081 --> 01:23:55,270
I mean the guy didn't want
to try to go to the body,

1413
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:59,380
he didn't duck in and when someone's
moving their head around like that just

1414
01:23:59,381 --> 01:24:03,160
smashed the ribs. You go right after this
gloss of the arms. Yeah. Hit those arms.

1415
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:06,810
So they tried to do with Floyd,
man. Yeah. Good luck, good luck.

1416
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:10,710
Flaws in the game that no
flaws. The flaws. One thing,

1417
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:15,310
it's like we're talking about with Ben
Aspirin that when a guy's a super elite

1418
01:24:15,311 --> 01:24:16,144
wrestler,

1419
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,850
you think you're going to do something
but he knows you think you're going to do

1420
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:21,970
something. So he does it. You
do what you were going to do,

1421
01:24:21,971 --> 01:24:23,560
he anticipates what you're going to do.

1422
01:24:23,561 --> 01:24:27,190
He has an answer to that and then you
have to regroup and he's already moving on

1423
01:24:27,191 --> 01:24:30,340
to step three. It's just too many
steps that he's ahead of you.

1424
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:33,460
Can there be a guy like with him
that you don't engage on the ground?

1425
01:24:33,461 --> 01:24:38,000
Like you just kind of Jab,
stay on the outside? Yeah,

1426
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:40,210
for sure. Look, Robbie Lawler, uh,

1427
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:44,860
almost took Ben Aspirin out in his last
fight and it was Ben's mental toughness

1428
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:46,300
and his ability to endure punishment.

1429
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:50,620
Most guys would have probably gone
unconscious there. Yeah. But style bender,

1430
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:54,220
like a garlic style bender would be one
of the worst fucking nightmares for a

1431
01:24:54,221 --> 01:24:58,270
guy like Ben ask him. Cause he's super
difficult to take down and on the feet.

1432
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:59,970
He's not going to do anything stupid.
Right.

1433
01:24:59,971 --> 01:25:02,500
You're going to move forward and try
to grab a hold of thing and you're just

1434
01:25:02,501 --> 01:25:07,501
gonna eat knuckle sandwich after knuckle
sandwich and he's gonna slowly chop at

1435
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:11,050
your legs walk. Yeah. And you're going
to feel that low calf kick and whack.

1436
01:25:11,051 --> 01:25:13,300
You're going to feel that
inside of your thigh. Shit.

1437
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,250
You going to try to walk off the pain,

1438
01:25:15,251 --> 01:25:17,560
you'll switch stances cause
it starts to hurt whack.

1439
01:25:17,561 --> 01:25:20,800
He didn't recognize you switching stances.
He attacks the other leg.

1440
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,850
Now both your legs are fucked up.
Yeah,

1441
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:26,850
he comes down the middle with a need
of the solar plexus. Now you're hurt.

1442
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:29,740
Try to play it off.

1443
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:34,750
It's just a matter of doing his
game in his instyle benders game.

1444
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:38,830
His game is keep the fight standing.
Fuck you up.

1445
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:43,810
And then Ben aspirins, it's grab a hold of
you. Fuck you up. Drag it to the ground.

1446
01:25:43,811 --> 01:25:46,480
Fuck you up.
It's a matter of like who,

1447
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:51,190
who's better at the weak aspect
of the other person's game, right?

1448
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:53,950
Yeah. Yeah. How can I take advantage?

1449
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:59,380
Crazy and no one could be the best
at everything. So some like MMA.

1450
01:25:59,381 --> 01:26:04,250
Math is a notoriously difficult
thing to do. Like say say if, uh,

1451
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,210
if Jamie beats me,
but I beat you,

1452
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:12,680
but you beat Jamie. Yeah.
Like that happened. But that's
what, that's Emma May math.

1453
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:15,840
It's crazy. Always say that with like,
you know, styles make fights. Yeah.

1454
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,570
But it doesn't work with Floyd.

1455
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:21,890
See Him boxing that styles
make fights only go so far.

1456
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,450
With MMA it's,

1457
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:28,100
it's because the sports more
comprehensive because there's more skills,

1458
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:31,190
there's more different things happen
in football compare to basketball.

1459
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,140
Maybe there's more,

1460
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:37,520
there's more tools that can be used in
here that can offset what's going on.

1461
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:41,990
Yeah. Basketball, the warriors are going
to beat any team four to seven games.

1462
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:45,650
It that's just going to happen. I don't
know shit about basketball or football,

1463
01:26:45,651 --> 01:26:47,420
so I'm just guessing.
You could be a superstar.

1464
01:26:47,421 --> 01:26:51,830
Like there's no one position in football
that can change the game. There's

1465
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:56,820
no, I think a quarterback's over
rated and to be honest with four,

1466
01:26:56,830 --> 01:27:00,470
I think the most important positions
is offensive. Defensive Line. Well,

1467
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:05,040
I'm always amazed at Tom Brady's
body, how regular it is. Super,

1468
01:27:05,041 --> 01:27:09,320
super reg, super regular, but they get it.
That whole, that team gets it. They like,

1469
01:27:09,670 --> 01:27:12,530
like I think Tom Praise like 15th
highest paid quarterback in the league.

1470
01:27:12,531 --> 01:27:15,980
It's like, right. But if you look
at elite athletes body, right,

1471
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:20,420
I want to see a dude is built
like Camacho Huseman. Yes.

1472
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:24,230
The UFC welterweight champion.
Yeah. That's an elite. You
look at them and go, oh,

1473
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:27,460
he's not an elite athlete. Looks like
a UFC champion. He's not only that.

1474
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,900
When you hit well, greatest
quarterback of all time, whoa.

1475
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:33,730
Can't wait to see this guy without
a shirt on. Like your father.

1476
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:42,010
You know what he looks like a Tom
Tom Brady. Tom Brady looks like.

1477
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,070
Yeah. I mean, what makes
that guy so special?

1478
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:49,910
Things like sometimes you know
something's going on. Yeah.

1479
01:27:49,911 --> 01:27:51,460
He's up here and I think,
you know,

1480
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:54,050
he's got a lot of it up here and
he works hard. It's like, you know,

1481
01:27:54,051 --> 01:27:57,250
sometimes the greatest aren't that great
picture of him next to [inaudible].

1482
01:27:58,820 --> 01:27:59,990
You know,
you know what it is.

1483
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:05,090
It's like sometimes having
all the natural tools is a,

1484
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:10,220
to your detriment is looking at that.
Yeah, Bro. Come on. Sample. Yeah,

1485
01:28:10,221 --> 01:28:15,150
like a leopard. Yeah, he's ready.
Yeah. Ben aspirins similar to, yeah,

1486
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:18,470
he's got a little muffins. He's got
a little muffled on a Ben aspirins.

1487
01:28:18,471 --> 01:28:19,340
Got even worse.

1488
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:23,990
Pull up a picture of Sam down in wait
Ben Aspirin cause he doesn't want to and

1489
01:28:23,991 --> 01:28:25,640
he's got it like that.
I don't give a fuck.

1490
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:29,510
He's,

1491
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:34,370
he feels like he's so much better as a
wrestler that everybody else is fucked.

1492
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:38,780
Gimme give me an image. Yeah, go
to his abdomen looking at that.

1493
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:45,320
I mean, he's got the ABS, he's
got Leslie underneath that. Uh,

1494
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:50,270
that's from one FC. He
looks even worse now. Yet.

1495
01:28:50,271 --> 01:28:53,030
Winning. Yeah, there he goes.

1496
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:58,760
I mean that is not, that's Tom Brady,
man. The ideal male combat body.

1497
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:02,010
You would think that's not
what the ideal body looks

1498
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,240
like, but he'll fuck shit up. Yeah.

1499
01:29:03,241 --> 01:29:06,630
This is a picture of him with
Kamara Huseman there, but
he's got a shirt on. Yeah.

1500
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:08,430
Ooh, Swan is insane. Lucky for him.

1501
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,650
But like this is just some guys that like,
okay,

1502
01:29:13,651 --> 01:29:15,480
Francis and Ghana is a perfect example.

1503
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:18,690
Some guys look like a destroyer.

1504
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:23,640
They just look like a destroyer.
In Ghana it was like six, five,

1505
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,620
200, maybe more than six. Like I think
you were saying earlier about the,

1506
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:32,730
about the uh, Jujitsu, right?
Like, and it's not just in,
in this, it's an anything.

1507
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:36,510
It's like sometimes the guys with all
the natural ability, they don't have the,

1508
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:41,970
the work ethic to be the greatest because
it comes so easy. You know? It's like,

1509
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:42,630
like we,

1510
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:47,630
we all know comics that are like so funny
hanging out and they're okay on stage

1511
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:51,900
and it's, I think it's be, as
comedy comes so easy to them,

1512
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:55,740
they don't hit the gym.
You know what I mean?

1513
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:58,620
Like maybe you need that like Jordan,

1514
01:29:58,621 --> 01:30:02,570
almost like sociopathic approach
to it. You know, we're like,

1515
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:06,840
like we were having this
conversation earlier is like, like,

1516
01:30:06,841 --> 01:30:09,390
do you think Jordan's happy?
I don't think he's happy.

1517
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:11,940
I remember when he was
inducted, abducted, abducted,

1518
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:14,880
inducted into the hall of fame. I think
it had to tell him he was in an abducted,

1519
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:19,880
in plain sight. And I was like,
well, if this guy fuck Jordan to

1520
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:22,963
the goat,

1521
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,770
do you remember when he was inducted
into the hall of fame and he was talking

1522
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:32,040
about writers, he's talking
shit about writers. Fuck yeah.

1523
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:35,880
He wasn't thanking his coaches and his
teammates and it's been an amazing ride

1524
01:30:35,881 --> 01:30:38,850
and I feel so blessed and fortunate.
No, he's still like, fuck you.

1525
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:39,720
Remember when you said that?

1526
01:30:39,721 --> 01:30:43,920
Fuck you [inaudible] 93 your
sports illustrated issue.

1527
01:30:43,921 --> 01:30:48,780
You said buy shoes look shitty.
Well he has his furnace race.

1528
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:52,560
Some people have, some people need
that as a furnace. Like they need that,

1529
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:57,480
that competitive drive, you
know? And like, I feel like,

1530
01:30:57,990 --> 01:31:02,550
I feel like that happens when you
don't derive joy from what you do.

1531
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:06,890
You know, like you derive joy
from that outcome. You're,

1532
01:31:06,891 --> 01:31:11,760
you're obsessed with outcome.
You know, like at least for me,

1533
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:17,490
everything before was outcome, right? It
was like, I'm good if, if I get a special,

1534
01:31:17,491 --> 01:31:20,400
I'm good if I'm doing these
things or I'm good if I kill.

1535
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:24,930
And the second I was stripped of
the opportunity to do those things.

1536
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:30,110
I actually found like I loved creating
more and then whatever the outcome was

1537
01:31:31,231 --> 01:31:35,550
was extra. Does that make sense?
I think it's a happier path.

1538
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:36,990
I think so too,

1539
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:42,290
but I don't know if it's the path to
greatness as much as the path of the

1540
01:31:43,261 --> 01:31:46,530
psychopath, especially when it
comes to competitive sport percent.

1541
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:52,060
Something about the best athletes.
They all miserable. How they,

1542
01:31:52,150 --> 01:31:54,540
they have a fucking self-loathing.

1543
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:57,300
They and they also have
an ego and they have this,

1544
01:31:57,301 --> 01:32:00,850
this anger towards the competition.
Yeah, like if you beat them,

1545
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:05,170
they would say that if you beat Jordan
and it came pool fucking hate you for

1546
01:32:05,171 --> 01:32:09,070
training again. Yeah, but
he needs it. He operates on,

1547
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:12,340
I'm not good enough and if I beat you then
he goes, all right, I was good enough.

1548
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:16,120
I don't even know if it's that he thinks
he's not good enough is that he knows

1549
01:32:16,121 --> 01:32:18,970
he can get you don't quit motherfucker.
I'm going to get you,

1550
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,250
but why does he need to get you?
I Dunno.

1551
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:25,640
He needs to because it's like he needs
to confirm something maybe. Right.

1552
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:29,720
I need to confirm. It's constant
confirmation. I need to confirm.

1553
01:32:29,721 --> 01:32:31,230
Confirm that Greg confirmed.

1554
01:32:31,231 --> 01:32:33,490
Confirm where it's not that
he doesn't believe he's great.

1555
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,820
It's that he wants to
confirm it constantly. It's
a little shadow of a doubt.

1556
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:39,550
Yeah, I'm great. I'm great.
He's walking around, I'm great,

1557
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:42,670
and there's a little voice in his head is
going, hey, you might not be that great.

1558
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:44,020
How about when he played baseball?

1559
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:47,680
That motherfucker want to prove
you're the hardest thing to sports.

1560
01:32:47,681 --> 01:32:50,620
Hitting a baseball.
It's the hardest fucking thing.

1561
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:56,140
And he just jumped from basketball to
baseball and was people act like he was

1562
01:32:56,141 --> 01:32:59,230
trash.
He wasn't even that bad.

1563
01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:04,990
He hit like two 50
no,

1564
01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:07,660
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not
a baseball card. I'm looking at.

1565
01:33:07,661 --> 01:33:10,600
Says he was three Oh two that
maybe what it might be for.

1566
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:15,450
That's for none on one 85 out of six 15
at bats. We're talking about the heart.

1567
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:18,280
This thing in sports is
hitting a fucking base.

1568
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:21,070
The fact that he,

1569
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:25,150
I mean there's a bunch of rumors and why
he even went into baseball in the first

1570
01:33:25,151 --> 01:33:29,230
place. But like that's, it's that
cycles and Campbelltown, right.

1571
01:33:29,231 --> 01:33:33,040
That's something we'll say is gambling.
Some people say, you know, there's,

1572
01:33:33,070 --> 01:33:34,800
there's a bunch of different
things. I don't want to, you know,

1573
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:37,510
put it out there cause I don't know.
But like it's one of those,

1574
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,200
I think there is a balance man.
I think that you could,

1575
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,810
I think if you truly love what you do,

1576
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:47,590
like if you love the creative aspect
and then you have high standards for

1577
01:33:47,591 --> 01:33:51,010
yourself, then you can achieve both. Yeah.

1578
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:55,060
I think that achieving
quote unquote greatness,

1579
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:59,380
um, and living with misery, I
don't think that's worth it.

1580
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:01,930
No, I don't think that's
where the, for you,

1581
01:34:01,931 --> 01:34:04,600
it's like you got one shot at this
man, like this, this life man.

1582
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,450
Like you got one shot at it,
try to figure it the fuck out.

1583
01:34:07,451 --> 01:34:10,060
And it takes time to figure the fuck out.

1584
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:13,510
But it's one of those things you
can't even really explain to people.

1585
01:34:13,511 --> 01:34:17,260
But if you can, I'm approaching this point
in my life where like, yeah, I think I,

1586
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:21,970
I get it. Does that make sense? Like how
old are you now? 35 yeah. And then like,

1587
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:26,740
it's like my, my buddy explains
it like this. He's like,

1588
01:34:26,741 --> 01:34:28,400
there's these different phases
in life. He's like, there's,

1589
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:30,700
and none of them is better or
worse than the other, but you know,

1590
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,010
there's this vegetable phase.
We were like,

1591
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:35,500
just going to work and then
coming home. Right. And, uh,

1592
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:38,470
you don't think about anything.
Then there's a why phase, right?

1593
01:34:38,471 --> 01:34:40,680
Which is what gets us into
comedy. A lot of us, right?

1594
01:34:40,690 --> 01:34:42,820
We started asking him why
she supposed to do with shit.

1595
01:34:42,821 --> 01:34:45,640
Like why do I have to have breakfast
in the morning or like whatever it is.

1596
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:50,500
We just, why. And then there's the phase,
which a lot of the discussion is on,

1597
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:55,390
on this show and a lot of comedy operates
is, which is everything is and isn't,

1598
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:58,070
not everything is or isn't.

1599
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:00,350
Right, right, right. It's like what,

1600
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:04,280
where you operate and why
people are drawn to this. Right.

1601
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:05,690
And why people are drawn to,

1602
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:10,840
maybe my stand up in other things is
we're shaking the foundation of the world.

1603
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:15,680
We're showing that the world isn't one
way. You're not either good or bad.

1604
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:19,820
Everybody and everything is both.

1605
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:22,970
The maggot had is so offensive to women,
right?

1606
01:35:22,971 --> 01:35:24,620
Cause it stands for these
offensive things. It's like,

1607
01:35:24,621 --> 01:35:26,300
well what about the Viking helmet?

1608
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,230
Like they did some fucked up shit
to women didn't today. Right?

1609
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:32,870
We wear that every Sunday for Vikings
Games, then people will, all right,

1610
01:35:32,871 --> 01:35:36,920
so two things can be true or two
things can be false, you know,

1611
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:40,010
and like that,
that place where like fucking comedy,

1612
01:35:40,011 --> 01:35:44,570
Liz works nuance where comedy lives
in a conversation lives, you know,

1613
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:48,470
that is an amazing place.
They not everybody gets to.

1614
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:52,130
Well that's what's so offensive about
progressive fake comedy is that they're

1615
01:35:52,131 --> 01:35:55,490
pretending the world's binaries.
It's one zero and you have to punch up.

1616
01:35:55,491 --> 01:35:59,380
All comedy is punching up.
I had a conversation with
this guy, wrote a book once.

1617
01:35:59,381 --> 01:36:02,570
There's no gray, there's no
gray. It's black or white.

1618
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:07,250
So without gray, they don't even
believe there's great like you.

1619
01:36:07,251 --> 01:36:10,880
And I take for granted that
we understand there's gray,

1620
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:14,280
we truly understand it,

1621
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:19,300
we truly get it and that's why we can
have a conversation about maybe some of

1622
01:36:19,611 --> 01:36:24,500
the most vile things and try
to put context into it or
nuance as you were saying.

1623
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:27,560
You know what I'm saying?
That conversation,

1624
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:31,250
tons of people are going to write comments
on are you motherfuckers are this and

1625
01:36:31,251 --> 01:36:33,370
then the other side is going to go.
You might've fuckers are that.

1626
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:38,180
It's so problematic that you're talking
about guest, so why? Why can we do that?

1627
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:40,040
What makes us able to do that?

1628
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:45,400
What do we understand about the world
that allows us to do that and how do we,

1629
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:51,020
you can't tell people things. You have
to show them. How can we show that

1630
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,200
humor? I think that's it. I think that's,

1631
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:00,710
I think that's why we're the first persons
killed when a dictatorship takes over

1632
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,430
the comedians. Yeah. The philosophers,
comedians, like anybody who goes, hey,

1633
01:37:04,431 --> 01:37:08,600
look at the world this way. Like get them
the fuck out of here. Stop Mocking Shit.

1634
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:11,990
Stop making people think
a little bit. Well, also,

1635
01:37:11,991 --> 01:37:15,290
the thing about comedy is I've always
said that if you can make someone laugh

1636
01:37:15,291 --> 01:37:17,180
about something,
you forced them to think about it.

1637
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,880
If you're just onstage
spouting your opinions,

1638
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:23,570
like one of the real problems that I
have with a lot of what they're calling

1639
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:26,590
comedy, where they're just waiting for
applause breaks and you say something,

1640
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:29,660
Bro clapped her intersectional,
you know,

1641
01:37:29,661 --> 01:37:33,590
ideas must be approached with the same,
they're abusing condo.

1642
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:36,080
Where you're doing that
they're doing is they're doing,

1643
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:38,840
is there a time where they can do
whatever the fuck they want with it?

1644
01:37:38,841 --> 01:37:42,590
But I know the difference. It's,
it's a, it's a hack. They've like,

1645
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:47,180
they figured out a way to like make
a shortcut, but it's not stand up.

1646
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:50,270
It's something else.
It's like you just expressing opinions.

1647
01:37:50,271 --> 01:37:54,740
But if you just onstage saying
your opinions on things,

1648
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:56,070
I can be in the audience.
Go on

1649
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,050
Ma. I don't agree with that.
I have a different opinion.

1650
01:37:58,350 --> 01:38:02,280
But if you're on stage saying
something that makes me laugh,

1651
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:06,690
even though I don't agree with your
philosophy, bull fighting. Ah, that's,

1652
01:38:06,691 --> 01:38:07,710
that's when it gets you,

1653
01:38:07,711 --> 01:38:12,210
like if you're a hardcore republican
Trump supporter and someone does a joke

1654
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:15,990
about Trump that makes you fucking laugh.
You're like, God dammit, he got me.

1655
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:17,440
This motherfucker got

1656
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:20,910
game the second you told me.
I can't joke around about some of this.

1657
01:38:21,070 --> 01:38:22,890
That's what I want to joke around about.

1658
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:26,890
Now you just gave me the bull and there's
this thing in bullfighting where if

1659
01:38:26,891 --> 01:38:31,840
you put a little bull out
there, the crowd boos. Oh right.

1660
01:38:31,841 --> 01:38:34,240
Because they want a dangerous book.
Fair.

1661
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:38,470
Trousseau and that's how comics feel
when we see you do an easy joke.

1662
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:43,000
We don't, we don't say it out loud,
but in our head we're like, yes,

1663
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:46,030
they're all going to laugh at a joke
about how women are smarter than men

1664
01:38:46,450 --> 01:38:49,780
because there's a bunch of dudes trying
to get pussy that are at that show with

1665
01:38:49,781 --> 01:38:54,330
the girl they're trying to get pussy
for. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. You know,

1666
01:38:54,490 --> 01:38:59,090
so it's like how do
you, it's putting, it's,

1667
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,730
it's that world where it operates in.

1668
01:39:00,910 --> 01:39:03,910
And then the next thing is I
think when I'm not there yet,

1669
01:39:03,911 --> 01:39:08,020
but I get glimpses and it's like
from nothing comes everything.

1670
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,410
You know,
like for me,

1671
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:15,070
I remember it for the show and the
comedy store in La when you walked in,

1672
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:20,140
like that was crazy for me because
obviously any comic, you're,

1673
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:23,410
you know, watching this show and
you're seeing and you're like, man,

1674
01:39:23,411 --> 01:39:27,220
it would be so cool. One day it'd be on
Joe Rogan's podcast. Right. And then,

1675
01:39:28,150 --> 01:39:32,140
but it was nothing I would ever ask for.
Cause I stopped asking,

1676
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:35,080
I stopped feeling entitled to anything.

1677
01:39:35,650 --> 01:39:38,860
I just decided like when you walked in,
I was like,

1678
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:42,250
this is awesome because I never
expect to see what I'm saying.

1679
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:46,750
I only do the shit that I want
to do because I can control that.

1680
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:50,160
And if I just worry about expecting or
wanting shit that I can't control being

1681
01:39:50,161 --> 01:39:53,330
miserable. Right. So and
you walked down and he did,

1682
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:55,480
he did the fucking show and
you're like, you're like, hey,

1683
01:39:55,481 --> 01:39:57,400
I heard some good stuff and we'll
check it out. And I was like,

1684
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:02,560
that's fucking unreal. And
I was overwhelmed because I
didn't ever expected shit.

1685
01:40:03,070 --> 01:40:07,180
And even in that moment I wouldn't ask
you to come on and I didn't care if I

1686
01:40:07,181 --> 01:40:10,300
didn't come on.
I didn't give a fuck because I was so

1687
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,990
grateful that that had happened.

1688
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:17,590
It was almost like I was just true to
comedy and all they wanted to do as good

1689
01:40:17,591 --> 01:40:19,890
comedy and the fucking,
that's how,

1690
01:40:20,210 --> 01:40:24,500
sorry, the universe's doors. That's it.
That's it. That's fucking it. If you,

1691
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:28,780
especially in this world, the world that
we live in, if you're doing real shit,

1692
01:40:28,781 --> 01:40:31,210
people find out about find
out, man, I hear about you.

1693
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:35,920
I heard about you through several people
and I was like, really? Oh, okay, cool.

1694
01:40:35,921 --> 01:40:39,700
Let me check them out. And then I saw
some of your shit online. Like Ah,

1695
01:40:40,090 --> 01:40:42,580
I could tell there's people
that are doing the real thing.

1696
01:40:42,581 --> 01:40:47,140
They're out there really doing comedy
and they're trying to make things funny

1697
01:40:47,141 --> 01:40:51,430
and they're talking about controversial
subjects and talk about different things

1698
01:40:51,431 --> 01:40:55,150
and their perspective in life and they're
worried about the industry's opinion

1699
01:40:55,151 --> 01:40:55,570
of him.

1700
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:59,410
And what you said was so true that in
the day everybody was trying to get a

1701
01:40:59,411 --> 01:41:01,630
sitcom man,
and that's all they were doing.

1702
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:05,440
They were doing these acts like you would
get actress who would get into comedy

1703
01:41:05,441 --> 01:41:08,060
just so they could put together
a seven minutes set. Yeah.

1704
01:41:08,061 --> 01:41:11,320
So they could get a sitcom off of it
and then they would stop doing standup.

1705
01:41:11,321 --> 01:41:12,190
It was a lot of that,

1706
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:18,060
but that world dried up when the sitcoms
dried up and it happened right around

1707
01:41:18,131 --> 01:41:21,520
the time that fear factor kicked
because when fear factor kicked in,

1708
01:41:21,521 --> 01:41:25,480
reality TV show squashed
all these sitcoms.

1709
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:28,770
And it was really funny because
some people were, it was, I had a,

1710
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,840
an argument with a comic
about that and he's like, man,

1711
01:41:31,841 --> 01:41:33,330
I just think it's fucked up that you,
you're,

1712
01:41:33,331 --> 01:41:36,370
you're doing a reality TV show and
supporting reality TV. I go, why?

1713
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:40,390
He goes because it takes jobs away from
comics that right on sitcoms. I go,

1714
01:41:40,391 --> 01:41:42,700
hey man, I go, first of all,

1715
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:45,400
they're not writers on sitcoms.

1716
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:49,390
They'd taken a job writing on sitcoms
while they're doing stand up comedy,

1717
01:41:49,391 --> 01:41:50,930
they're fucking comics.
Okay,

1718
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:56,230
I'm taking a job making people eat
animal dicks while I'm doing calming the

1719
01:41:56,231 --> 01:41:56,740
differences.

1720
01:41:56,740 --> 01:42:00,310
I'm still doing comedy and
these motherfuckers are just
looking for some sort of

1721
01:42:00,311 --> 01:42:03,610
a gravy train to ride off into the sunset.
They're there.

1722
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:05,830
If the show was good,

1723
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:09,790
people would watch it instead of these
reality shows and then it wouldn't exist

1724
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:10,030
anymore.

1725
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:15,030
But there was so many bad sitcoms that
it opened the door to real housewives and

1726
01:42:15,341 --> 01:42:18,520
all these other things and the
next thing you know named me,

1727
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:21,010
name me three set go
that are on right now.

1728
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:25,190
Can, can I take it one step
further? There'll never be
another hit sitcom again.

1729
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:29,510
They probably won't. It is over. It's
probably over and I'm walking around my,

1730
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:33,440
the agency that I'm with a yesterday
and I'm talking to people and they don't

1731
01:42:33,441 --> 01:42:37,400
get it. No Bro. If I felt like
Christian Bale in the big short,

1732
01:42:37,620 --> 01:42:41,780
I'm just walking around or it's over.
It's over. Do you guys not know?

1733
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:46,730
We need to write a show around you. I'm
like, guys, guys, guys, there's no more,

1734
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:47,720
you know,
it's really over.

1735
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:51,010
Do you ever look at the fucking ratings
for late night television? Okay,

1736
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:55,660
it's done. It's crazy. This is
why this one's crazy. Flips up it.

1737
01:42:56,150 --> 01:42:59,570
You just put your clips up in your
clips up, Instagram, everything. Look,

1738
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,760
everything that I've, that
I've done, it's for comics.

1739
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:06,440
Like don't think that like you're copying
or anything like that. It's for you.

1740
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:10,880
Look at the blueprint.
Yeah, copy it. Improve it.

1741
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:14,990
Tell me how you improve it, but empower
yourself. That's what this is for.

1742
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:18,140
The blueprint of putting
things up on, using things up.
Youtube, Instagram, Twitter,

1743
01:43:18,141 --> 01:43:21,530
like any and like I have a lot of comics
who reached out. Just ask questions,

1744
01:43:21,531 --> 01:43:23,210
but I'm here as a resource for you.

1745
01:43:23,211 --> 01:43:28,010
Comedy is at its best when we are helping
each other and New York doesn't get

1746
01:43:28,011 --> 01:43:32,030
that right now just yet. Well, there's
less opportunity. That's, that's it.

1747
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:36,740
You know what happened in la, but the
sit Compton bro, you're a fucking dude.

1748
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:40,730
It is so done. This is how you
know, you know how I know it's done.

1749
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:44,150
What is your favorite scene in a
sitcom or, or what top five scene.

1750
01:43:44,151 --> 01:43:45,470
Just a scene you loved and a Sitcom.

1751
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:47,830
Even though I was in a
sitcom for five years. Yeah.

1752
01:43:47,831 --> 01:43:50,410
And I don't really watched them,
so, okay, fair enough. Well,

1753
01:43:50,411 --> 01:43:52,040
I'll watch unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,

1754
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:53,780
but that's a single camera that doesn't,

1755
01:43:53,781 --> 01:43:55,910
it's a little different cause
there's like so audience,

1756
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:58,250
but like anybody's listening right now,
right?

1757
01:43:58,251 --> 01:43:59,960
Like you can think of one of
your favorite scenes, right?

1758
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:03,350
Try to think of how that episode began.
You don't know.

1759
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,110
Try to think about how it
ended. You don't know. Right.

1760
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:08,090
Because the narrative was never important.

1761
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:10,790
The narrative was to
fill 30 minutes of time.

1762
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:13,940
The only thing that was important where
the five sketches that fill that 30

1763
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:17,590
minutes of time, 22 minutes
or 2022 yeah, exactly. So,

1764
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:21,860
so it's like those five sketches don't
have to have that bullshit narrative.

1765
01:44:21,970 --> 01:44:22,803
Right,
right.

1766
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:26,840
So right now you really just need four
or five friends that are doing the same

1767
01:44:26,841 --> 01:44:30,110
kind of funny shit. We're already
seeing the new sitcom right now.

1768
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:34,250
It's already existing. Well on Instagram
it's just a not a good art form.

1769
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:34,791
You know,

1770
01:44:34,791 --> 01:44:39,170
if you watch like the big bang or two and
a half man and those are grandfathered

1771
01:44:39,171 --> 01:44:40,910
in. Right. It's like that came
from a time when it was there.

1772
01:44:40,911 --> 01:44:44,660
But like they weren't,
they're not entertaining. They
certainly don't stand up.

1773
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:49,100
Like that's also why Netflix kicked
in with a lot of their dramas.

1774
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:53,030
Cause they can get away with things
on stranger things or on Ozark.

1775
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:56,660
They can get away with shit you just
could never fucking do on regular

1776
01:44:56,661 --> 01:44:59,810
television. It's way more
wild. It's way more raw.

1777
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:03,250
It's like you're watching a better movie.
They not only does,

1778
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,570
cause it used to be that if you did film,

1779
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:09,530
you didn't want to do television cause
television sucked. Right. Like television,

1780
01:45:09,531 --> 01:45:14,270
you do an air wolf or something like
that and doing something terrible shit.

1781
01:45:14,271 --> 01:45:18,860
It's obvious. You see it
coming a mile away. It's made
for morons. Yeah. Yeah. Or,

1782
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:21,890
you know,
you did film and if you did film boy,

1783
01:45:21,891 --> 01:45:24,830
you got a chance to work with some of
the most amazing directors and do these

1784
01:45:24,831 --> 01:45:28,560
incredible pieces.
But Netflix came along and,

1785
01:45:28,650 --> 01:45:32,570
and really it was before Netflix
Soprano's laid the blueprint,

1786
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:36,290
exact surprised wire the wire.
I didn't watch the wire,

1787
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:38,420
but it did the same sort of thing,
right?

1788
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:43,660
They created a new movie every week and
it all went together and it lasted a

1789
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:46,910
hundred hours. Right? And
so you're like, oh my God.

1790
01:45:46,911 --> 01:45:50,960
Well regular movies is so shallow. I got
not even getting into the characters.

1791
01:45:50,961 --> 01:45:53,150
Right? Yeah, this guys, 10 years later,

1792
01:45:53,151 --> 01:45:55,970
you see him 10 years later and the
same movie, right? He's got a beard.

1793
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:58,500
Fuck is this, this is terrible. And,

1794
01:45:58,530 --> 01:46:02,930
and why is it because movies
got so expensive to make.

1795
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:06,500
You couldn't take risks on stories
that we didn't already know about.

1796
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:11,330
Movies became 200 or a hundred million.
Now if I go to you and I'm like, okay,

1797
01:46:11,331 --> 01:46:13,070
give me 200 million to make a movie about,

1798
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:17,930
it's this a mob guy and he's Kinda
got like some anxiety you like,

1799
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:20,750
are you out of your fucking mind?
But if I say,

1800
01:46:20,751 --> 01:46:23,600
give me 200 million to make a
movie about marvel, it's like, oh,

1801
01:46:23,601 --> 01:46:26,840
that's an existing fan base.
Is it based on a book or a comic?

1802
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:31,490
So right now the only movies we see are
either big budget that have a built in

1803
01:46:31,491 --> 01:46:35,140
audience or $3 million comedy.
Right.

1804
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:39,950
That middle grounds right there. That
used to be awesome movies. TV. Yeah.

1805
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:41,750
So now TV is the shit.

1806
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,990
It's all these dope stores like
breaking bad should have been a movie,

1807
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:49,980
but they turn that motherfucker into
a TV show. A betters. Yeah. And they

1808
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,820
were restricted because it's
cable. There was an HBO, right.

1809
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:56,310
And they had commercials and all
that stupid shit. Yeah. I mean,

1810
01:46:56,790 --> 01:47:01,680
what happened was with comics was the
internet came along and all the sudden

1811
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:02,543
there was these,

1812
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:06,870
this wealth of avenues where
comedians could show their work.

1813
01:47:06,871 --> 01:47:09,330
Whereas before you were
limited by the gatekeepers.

1814
01:47:09,710 --> 01:47:13,890
The gatekeepers were either sitcoms and
the sitcoms was what everybody wanted to

1815
01:47:13,891 --> 01:47:16,230
get. Cause you've got to sit
calm. Then you were all set.

1816
01:47:16,231 --> 01:47:18,840
You were Jerry Seinfeld
or you were Roseanne. Yup.

1817
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:23,250
And then it became
something along the line.

1818
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:27,620
Russell and you like both guys.
Russell Peters in particular. Yeah.

1819
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:31,710
Became gigantic selling out arenas
from youtube. That's where it came.

1820
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:35,400
I put little clips is shit came up.
And if you ever met Russell,

1821
01:47:35,401 --> 01:47:38,610
he's one of the most generous
guys in the world. Super Generous.

1822
01:47:38,611 --> 01:47:42,510
I know him comics who's rentees paid,
he's the best. He's just such a great guy.

1823
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:47,460
But he's also a guy that recognizes that
you got to give some back. You gotta be,

1824
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:51,600
and this just has his personality.
He's just so gregarious, outgoing guy.

1825
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:57,060
All these podcasts that popped up,
people realize like, Hey, you know,

1826
01:47:57,061 --> 01:48:00,450
we're not in competition with each other
like Jay Leno and David Letterman work.

1827
01:48:00,451 --> 01:48:02,010
Cause everybody wanted
the tonight show spot.

1828
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:05,820
Right now there's a thousand tonight
shows and if you have the tonight show and

1829
01:48:05,821 --> 01:48:08,880
I have the tonight show, I'm
like, hey, you should check
out Andrew's tonight show.

1830
01:48:08,881 --> 01:48:11,360
It's fucking great.
Like this is okay.

1831
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:15,740
This is the tonight show your Carson.
But we figured out a way, Carson. Now,

1832
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:20,030
do you know that? Right? That's
the difference. That's the shift.

1833
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:25,070
That's why Netflix can't even compete.
Netflix has done, Dana had done, done,

1834
01:48:25,190 --> 01:48:27,800
what are you talking about?
You see Charlie Wilson's war,

1835
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:32,690
no movie about Tom Hanks movie about
America getting an a evolved with the

1836
01:48:32,691 --> 01:48:36,440
Afghan conflict and Afghanistan
war doesn't really matter,
but the idea is yes,

1837
01:48:37,190 --> 01:48:40,220
they're fighting the Russians,
the Afghanis, right? Right.
So the Americans go, okay,

1838
01:48:40,221 --> 01:48:41,054
boom,

1839
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:45,770
give them a $5,000 rocket launcher and
they're going to shoot down a $5 million

1840
01:48:45,771 --> 01:48:49,010
helicopter and eventually Russia
just won't be able to compete, right?

1841
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:54,310
Netflix pays $100 million to Aaron
Sorkin or whoever to make a TV show,

1842
01:48:54,890 --> 01:48:57,140
right? Right. The distracts
you for two hours, right?

1843
01:48:57,470 --> 01:49:02,470
Youtube pay zero million dollars to Joe
Rogan and Jamie to make a podcast that

1844
01:49:04,971 --> 01:49:07,760
distracts you for two hours every day.

1845
01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:10,250
Netflix cannot compete,

1846
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:12,790
but it's a different animal. You
got to realize, first of all,

1847
01:49:12,791 --> 01:49:14,800
they have way more people than just me.

1848
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:18,700
They also are putting together something
that requires a lot of money to create.

1849
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:22,900
Sure. You enjoy films. Yes, yes. Or
if you enjoy a show like Ozar, sure.

1850
01:49:22,901 --> 01:49:24,250
Stranger things along for narrative.

1851
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:27,940
It takes a lot of money to make
those things are special effects.

1852
01:49:27,941 --> 01:49:30,280
There's camera people and
makeup people in here.

1853
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:35,340
There's a lot of lock on art directors
and producers and actors and he'd say

1854
01:49:36,161 --> 01:49:40,090
giant fucking tense or with Pete,
but people aren't watching it.

1855
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:41,500
You know what they're watching.
People are watching that.

1856
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:44,230
They're watching friends. No,
no, no, no, no. In free, dude.

1857
01:49:44,290 --> 01:49:48,250
There's a reason they paid us terrible.
Does it matter if it's as Jamie

1858
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:52,300
the most two most viewed shows on Netflix
right now? Netflix doesn't own, okay.

1859
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:54,280
Netflix isn't even trying to make money
anymore. They're getting bought out.

1860
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:58,630
It's Facebook, Amazon, but they want
it. That's the goal of the strategy.

1861
01:49:58,631 --> 01:50:00,490
Now the 10 billion in debt,
there's no way they can make money.

1862
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:03,590
There's 10 billion and billion,
billion,

1863
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:06,760
but they make hundreds of
millions of dollars a month.

1864
01:50:06,761 --> 01:50:09,880
Like how many people
do they have on board?

1865
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:14,680
How many subscribers do they have
that are paying $9 as far as I know,

1866
01:50:14,681 --> 01:50:17,920
they don't share that information. They're
killing it in terms of subscribers,

1867
01:50:17,921 --> 01:50:20,920
but they're 10 billion in debt. They
just talk on another 2 billion. Right.

1868
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:24,010
When I say Netflix has done, I'm speaking
when anytime I make declarations,

1869
01:50:24,011 --> 01:50:27,040
I'm speaking in the future. Right?
We prepare now for the future, right?

1870
01:50:27,041 --> 01:50:28,870
So it's like how will they hear it goes?

1871
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:32,360
Netflix will keep friends through
next year and $100 million payment.

1872
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:34,330
$100 million,
right?

1873
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:37,810
For one year friends and then the
office to know what that is though.

1874
01:50:37,811 --> 01:50:39,640
That's like nostalgia style Jack.
Right?

1875
01:50:39,710 --> 01:50:43,340
So all viewing right now is
nostalgia even? Well, not all of you.

1876
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:47,410
If you look at TV, right? What
the great, this, this, this
past year is in TV, right?

1877
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,050
The OJ trial and FX.
What does that,

1878
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:53,770
I remember how it was when the Oj
thing came out. Did Not do that great.

1879
01:50:53,771 --> 01:50:57,340
Killed it. Won all the awards,
everything. The Versace story,

1880
01:50:57,370 --> 01:51:01,920
which was another thing like what? That
out of the loop, I'm just 39 million.

1881
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:06,760
139 million subscribers paying
$10 a month. Is that what it is?

1882
01:51:06,761 --> 01:51:10,210
How much the cross like that? Maybe even
more. Maybe 11 how much of the cost?

1883
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,990
They just bumped it up to 12 I
think 12 bucks a month. Sure.

1884
01:51:13,330 --> 01:51:16,480
That ladies and gentlemen is
a fuck load of income. Sure.

1885
01:51:16,570 --> 01:51:17,530
So they got a lot coming in,

1886
01:51:17,531 --> 01:51:20,350
but they're spending a lot too because
they're trying to hundred 30 they're

1887
01:51:20,351 --> 01:51:23,770
trying to overtake all the others
and then they got Jeff Bezos,

1888
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:26,680
you know captain money bags up there.
A scrooge McDuck right.

1889
01:51:26,710 --> 01:51:28,720
He's trying to do the same thing.
Facebook shoebox.

1890
01:51:28,730 --> 01:51:33,520
Just where I saw you on the pee
pee. Yeah. I was like, yeah, true.

1891
01:51:33,550 --> 01:51:36,400
But that's thing basles can lose money
on this shit because he's making tons of

1892
01:51:36,401 --> 01:51:37,950
money on paper towels and what,
whatever.

1893
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:40,990
How much he is losing because he's
got a lot of fucking series at.

1894
01:51:40,991 --> 01:51:42,910
Ain't nobody watching them
that put it out there,

1895
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:46,990
but he's doing something
that's even more weird. Okay.

1896
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:49,310
Because there's no one
watching those shows. Yeah,

1897
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:52,220
there's a ton of fucking shows on Amazon.

1898
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:55,100
No fucking no one's watching.

1899
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:58,840
I would like to see their numbers cause
I bet they have some shows they might,

1900
01:51:58,930 --> 01:52:02,260
they might have spent $1 million
to make and have like four viewers.

1901
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:06,070
There's fucking no one watched these
shows. They were just going after awards.

1902
01:52:06,370 --> 01:52:08,230
They're thing was we're
going to make the artsy shit,

1903
01:52:08,790 --> 01:52:11,090
it's going to give us a grammy or
something like that and then we'll like

1904
01:52:11,290 --> 01:52:14,590
qualify our platform. It's a
smart approach. Like Youtube,

1905
01:52:14,591 --> 01:52:16,450
his approach was the exact
opposite, right. We're like,

1906
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:19,660
we're just going to create this stuff
that we think people want to watch.

1907
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:21,580
Well Youtube doesn't create much.

1908
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:24,690
They did a little and they took
down the paywall. Like my thing I,

1909
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:27,790
my guests with youtube is
there waiting for Netflix.

1910
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:30,400
You know that scene in the
movie where like that somebody,

1911
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:34,660
somebody's caught in like an enclosed
space and water starts coming in and the

1912
01:52:34,661 --> 01:52:37,600
water gets right up to like
his lips, you know, he's like,

1913
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:40,780
he's trying to breathe a little bit more
and I think youtube is going to be the

1914
01:52:40,781 --> 01:52:44,140
one to pour the last drop of water.
Well I think it's such a different thing.

1915
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:46,970
I think you're talking about totally
different things because Netflix has never

1916
01:52:46,971 --> 01:52:51,620
aimed to be a user created
content streaming site.
Right? The right they're not,

1917
01:52:51,621 --> 01:52:54,380
but at the end of the day
it's just distraction I think.

1918
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:57,260
I think that's what we've got to start
looking at content as right is it,

1919
01:52:57,330 --> 01:53:02,330
it's just raw distraction and Netflix
occupies a space for distraction did

1920
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:04,640
smaller than youtube,

1921
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:08,420
so I can watch a two hour thing
on youtube at home on my TV.

1922
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:12,890
I can watch a two minute thing on the
bus as I'm going to work on youtube,

1923
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:16,100
you know, I can watch
a 15 minute, you know,

1924
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:20,180
peace like Vlog or something like that.
I can watch all the whole spectrum.

1925
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:23,390
Netflix. I'm really just watching
at home or like a foam on a trip.

1926
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:27,230
You know what I mean? It's really, I'm not
watching a two minute thing on Netflix.

1927
01:53:27,650 --> 01:53:30,800
You know what I mean? It's, it is
the shit for now. Don't get me wrong.

1928
01:53:30,950 --> 01:53:35,270
It absolutely the shit for
now. Right. But if I was being,

1929
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:40,310
if I'm putting my money on it, I
would say if I'm Facebook, I buy it.

1930
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:44,450
And then imagine having
your Facebook feed,

1931
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:48,350
you just watched a show and then you
get to share it immediately on your

1932
01:53:48,351 --> 01:53:49,700
Facebook followers.
Facebook,

1933
01:53:49,701 --> 01:53:53,210
I'd be super careful about buying anything
cause I think the government's been

1934
01:53:53,211 --> 01:53:56,630
thinking about breaking them up for a
while and Elizabeth Warren is already

1935
01:53:56,631 --> 01:53:57,500
talking about that.

1936
01:53:57,650 --> 01:54:02,450
That's one of the parts of her platform
and running for president is breaking up

1937
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:05,380
apple, breaking up Facebook,
breaking up Twitter.

1938
01:54:05,381 --> 01:54:07,640
She wants to break up all these
things she thinks are monopolies.

1939
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:08,510
What's your feeling on that?

1940
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:13,760
Get the fuck Outta here with that shit
is goofy is goofy's fuck. What's up?

1941
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:18,980
Disney takeover of 21st century
Fox takes place, I think next week.

1942
01:54:18,981 --> 01:54:21,850
The 20th to Bega. They're going to put
out their own streaming, everything.

1943
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:22,251
They've just,

1944
01:54:22,251 --> 01:54:26,150
they've bought like everything except
for Fox News and Fox sports took over all

1945
01:54:26,151 --> 01:54:28,100
of their production movie facilities.

1946
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:33,070
It's like 5,000 people might be losing
their job because all that contents

1947
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:35,420
coming off a Netflix,
all those marvel shows,

1948
01:54:35,421 --> 01:54:38,750
all that shit is going to come over to
them. So now they're going to have a nice,

1949
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:42,500
they've been canceling all
these marvel shows on Netflix.

1950
01:54:42,501 --> 01:54:45,290
I keep investing in something
that you're going to take off,

1951
01:54:45,291 --> 01:54:48,570
like I'm going to build up a brand and
then you're going to remove it, right?

1952
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:52,280
They've got, so they got all the
kids movies. You're a bear a dad,

1953
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:55,190
you know what I mean? Dude, I go to
Disneyland twice a year at least.

1954
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:57,380
Which you're gonna not have
a streaming Disney program.

1955
01:54:58,170 --> 01:55:03,160
Apple's also starting their streaming
service soon tomorrow or some shit on

1956
01:55:03,170 --> 01:55:06,170
those win. But there's a bunch, I'm,
tons of rumors are comfortable today.

1957
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:09,890
You know what it's like, you know, the
perestroika, like what happened in Russia,

1958
01:55:09,891 --> 01:55:13,310
like where the, uh, overnight,
you know, it fell and they
sold off the state assets.

1959
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:15,320
Like a few people and everybody
came. Billionaires, right.

1960
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:18,680
That's what's happening right
now in entertainment, dude.
People don't realize it,

1961
01:55:18,681 --> 01:55:21,140
but like it's fucking done.

1962
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:26,320
Like the days of the days of like
fame being about distance are done.

1963
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:30,050
Distance, distance. Like I'm Johnny Depp.

1964
01:55:30,051 --> 01:55:33,920
I'm going to go away to my like little
home somewhere in the Alps and you will

1965
01:55:33,921 --> 01:55:37,910
see me twice a year. You're
not, I'm weird. Or Marlon
Brando. I'm, I'm out here.

1966
01:55:37,911 --> 01:55:41,270
I'm weird. I'm different. You
know. It's like now it's proximity.

1967
01:55:41,410 --> 01:55:43,890
There's a reason why no value
in being weird anymore. Well,

1968
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:48,150
Marlon Brando. Tyler Perry
has an island, bro. Really?

1969
01:55:50,490 --> 01:55:54,810
That's interesting. Have you been
invited? No. No. That's fucked up.

1970
01:55:55,110 --> 01:55:58,540
I don't want to go. I ain't going to
anybody's fucking island. That's my rule.

1971
01:55:58,580 --> 01:56:01,350
Bronson. Somebody wants to
ask what's in the Virgin Dude?

1972
01:56:02,070 --> 01:56:04,500
Richard Bronson or whatever his name is.
Johnson Branson.

1973
01:56:04,501 --> 01:56:07,680
Yank on his fucking island. I don't want
to hang out with a dude with Branson.

1974
01:56:07,850 --> 01:56:12,290
Why? Why? When I could jet ski with Joey.
T is, listen, I ain't, I don't know.

1975
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:15,810
Hanging out with any dude who has
an island. Get the fuck Outta here.

1976
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:19,500
Mccone or island because they always want
you to go to the island. Like, bitch,

1977
01:56:19,501 --> 01:56:24,420
I ain't going to, your island is going
to the diner. No. Who, who's that?

1978
01:56:24,450 --> 01:56:28,170
Eddie Murphy. Eddie Murphy has an
island. Yep. What would you get up?

1979
01:56:28,330 --> 01:56:31,410
You go to Eddie's. I'm might go daddy's.
He got it. Got It. I like Getty.

1980
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:35,460
I met Eddie and I was good friends
with his brother and good guy.

1981
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:40,230
Petrolia was the best. Charlie was the
greatest guy of all time. Yeah. Uh,

1982
01:56:40,430 --> 01:56:42,990
I met Eddie when,
when I met Eddie Murphy,

1983
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,860
I met Eddie Murphy in Maui and he'd go
it first words out of his mouth. He goes,

1984
01:56:46,970 --> 01:56:51,060
you are funny, motherfucker. I was
like, God damn. Yes. This is recently,

1985
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:54,930
no years ago. Maybe more
than 10 years ago. Yeah.

1986
01:56:54,931 --> 01:56:59,100
That's like 2007 something like
that. It'd be unreal. Crazy funny.

1987
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:03,570
In Hawaii with my family,
I'll say thank you. Like,

1988
01:57:03,571 --> 01:57:07,180
what do you say when Eddie Murphy says
you're a funny motherfucker? I'm like,

1989
01:57:07,190 --> 01:57:11,550
Holy Shit. Wow. It felt great. You know,

1990
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:16,060
she looked at your wife and be like see
chuckle every once in a while. Yeah.

1991
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:24,330
Honestly, at home, I'm not that funny.
My wife cracks most of the jokes. Really?

1992
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:29,220
Yeah. I don't have to be funny
like a, I don't need it. You know,

1993
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:32,160
it's one of the reasons why I like to
hang around with Joey Diaz cause he's

1994
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:36,780
always funny and he's always the
funny guy. You know? I like it.

1995
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:41,160
It's uh, you know, I like being
around funny people, man. I'm not,

1996
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:46,290
the thing about comics, especially the
needy annoying ones and the early days,

1997
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:50,330
like early days of your career, they
have to be the center of attention. Yeah.

1998
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:52,110
That shit is really annoying.

1999
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:56,700
And one of the things that you learned
for sure about hosting a podcast is you

2000
01:57:56,701 --> 01:57:58,710
don't really want to be
the center of attention.

2001
01:57:58,860 --> 01:58:00,720
You just want to
facilitate a conversation.

2002
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:04,770
You just want to make the best creation.
What's the best creation?

2003
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,830
The best creation is let this guy rant.
You gotta let them rent.

2004
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:10,560
Get out of the way.
If the best creation as rent with them,

2005
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:13,290
you jump in together and you'd go
back and forth like a game of tennis,

2006
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:14,220
then you do it that way,

2007
01:58:14,570 --> 01:58:17,880
but you have to be able to feel the vibe
and then some people are not going to

2008
01:58:17,881 --> 01:58:19,680
like it that way. They're
going to want it. Well,

2009
01:58:19,690 --> 01:58:22,470
why don't you let your guests talk?
Like people love to say shit like that.

2010
01:58:22,830 --> 01:58:26,880
Like you wonder why you interrupted his
rants. I love to say things like that.

2011
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:30,720
See like you're trying to make a
creation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a,

2012
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:33,570
comics are not great listeners.
Some of them are as well.

2013
01:58:33,571 --> 01:58:38,310
The ones that are are great at this.
Yeah. Right. And uh, the ones that are,

2014
01:58:38,311 --> 01:58:42,070
it's tough for them to do this and
people know, man, they, it's, it's

2015
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:46,980
how, how comfortable is it when it
gets in through their ears? Yeah.

2016
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:50,590
Like is it getting an easy or
is it like, oh, this guy's on.

2017
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:53,830
No, yeah, yeah. I'll
bring on a guest here.

2018
01:58:53,831 --> 01:58:57,820
The guests say something and I just
cringe because I anticipate the comments.

2019
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:02,350
I'm just like, dude, you're about to
get crushed by the weight of the world.

2020
01:59:02,860 --> 01:59:03,693
Will you?

2021
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:08,380
Well, you quiet somebody.
No, I mean if I have to, uh,

2022
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:10,790
try not to,
if I have to correct them,

2023
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:13,550
like if they're saying something
that I know to be inaccurate,

2024
01:59:14,090 --> 01:59:15,410
if it's in my wheelhouse,

2025
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:18,680
like sometimes people say something
and I'll just say that's not,

2026
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:21,350
that's not true. Here's why
that's not true. You know,

2027
01:59:21,351 --> 01:59:26,030
I've had people say some goofy shit and
it just happens to be something I know a

2028
01:59:26,031 --> 01:59:30,230
lot about and then I have to stop it.
Yeah, okay. That makes, that makes sense.

2029
01:59:31,580 --> 01:59:34,640
But for the most part, I, I want
people to just be themselves.

2030
01:59:35,070 --> 01:59:37,730
I got to figure out how
to get you to be yourself.

2031
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:41,000
That's what a lot of this is
comfortable make you realize that.

2032
01:59:41,001 --> 01:59:43,430
I just want you to do great.
I want everybody to do great.

2033
01:59:43,730 --> 01:59:47,690
Are you ever intimidated by a
guest? By their intellect? Yeah.

2034
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:51,560
Like Elon Musk was intimidating talking
to him cause you realize what a champ

2035
01:59:51,561 --> 01:59:55,700
you are still that way. Oh
yeah. I'm a fucking dummy man.

2036
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:59,270
But like talking to this guy, I'm like,
I'm a fucking chimp. Here's a question.

2037
02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:03,250
He's just kind of like a champ one

2038
02:00:05,150 --> 02:00:08,660
should I got to go to Mars?
Huh. Cool wants smokes weed.

2039
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:12,773
Okay.

2040
02:00:14,860 --> 02:00:16,580
He's got a big a cut of that

2041
02:00:18,710 --> 02:00:23,360
mother making electric cars, you
know, sending rockets into the space.

2042
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:25,640
He's drilling holes under the ground.

2043
02:00:25,641 --> 02:00:28,130
You had to dumb them down
with Megan solar cities.

2044
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:32,680
We didn't even, didn't even work,
but, so here's my take on it. Right.

2045
02:00:32,710 --> 02:00:34,090
I'm watching Musk.
Right.

2046
02:00:35,170 --> 02:00:39,910
And he basically is opening up to
you about how he's not happy. Yeah,

2047
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:42,700
right.
There's this moment where he's like,

2048
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:45,700
I think he said something to stand
of you one want to be me. Yeah.

2049
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:48,010
He's just as his exact words.
He wouldn't want to be mean.

2050
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:51,940
You wouldn't want to be me.
So that means he doesn't want to be him.

2051
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:56,980
I think on some level he doesn't
want to be him. Right. And

2052
02:00:58,510 --> 02:01:03,160
he's so with these guys that we admire
because they're so brilliant and they

2053
02:01:03,161 --> 02:01:04,560
have all these brilliant ideas and we're,

2054
02:01:04,561 --> 02:01:08,260
we're putting this matrix of we're all
in this success matrix. On some level,

2055
02:01:08,261 --> 02:01:12,370
right? Where it's like get things done
good. Don't they can get things on bad.

2056
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:15,580
Right?
I wonder if

2057
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:22,320
if he's chimp ish in that he's potentially
wasting his life being upset or

2058
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:28,720
miserable when he could be focusing
on things that would give them joy.

2059
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:30,583
Is that being,

2060
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:35,900
is that being a fucking chimp is being
so smart that you don't even try to just

2061
02:01:37,211 --> 02:01:40,220
be happy and focus on your happiness?
I don't

2062
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:42,020
necessarily think he's unhappy,

2063
02:01:42,021 --> 02:01:46,670
but I do think that he puts himself into
situations where the amount of stress

2064
02:01:46,671 --> 02:01:49,310
that he absorbs is almost unfathomable.

2065
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:54,080
Like when he was trying to get the Tesla
model three production re scheduled

2066
02:01:54,081 --> 02:01:57,650
ramped up and he was sleeping on the
floor of the factory and working literally

2067
02:01:57,651 --> 02:02:02,000
working like 1920 hours a day.
That that's untenable.

2068
02:02:02,001 --> 02:02:03,800
You can only do that for
short periods of time. Right.

2069
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:09,310
But I think that what I was saying
about Kanye West applies to him tenfold.

2070
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:10,213
Okay.
He's,

2071
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:15,290
he's got a power output that's
extraordinarily different
than the average person.

2072
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:17,960
And that's one of the things he was
talking about when he was young. I mean,

2073
02:02:17,961 --> 02:02:19,790
you could probably put
him on some sort of, uh,

2074
02:02:20,330 --> 02:02:24,520
W W I don't know what the
super genius spectrum is,
right? Like what is, you know,

2075
02:02:24,610 --> 02:02:28,910
what's, what's Albert Einstein, right?
What's, what's this guy? What's that guy?

2076
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:34,000
He's in there somewhere and it's crazy
realm of the way your brain works.

2077
02:02:34,581 --> 02:02:39,110
Like, I think the brains are
like all other body parts.

2078
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:43,310
Some people born with little tiny dicks
and some people got giant hogs and

2079
02:02:43,311 --> 02:02:44,270
that's just a fact.

2080
02:02:45,290 --> 02:02:48,830
And I think that dude has
a giant hot of a brain

2081
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:54,050
and it just works better.
It just,

2082
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:58,550
it just is operating on a level that
you and I can't, we can't comprehend.

2083
02:02:58,730 --> 02:03:00,890
But I never invented a
God damn thing in my life.

2084
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:04,010
But I'm driving around and
Elon Musk's car, you know,

2085
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:07,190
that mother fucker made a car and that's
like some shitty does on the side.

2086
02:03:07,370 --> 02:03:11,750
You know, his car thing is like,
after he invented paypal and he's,

2087
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:13,670
by the way,
while he's doing the car,

2088
02:03:13,730 --> 02:03:16,850
he shoot rockets into space and
drilling holes into the ground.

2089
02:03:17,090 --> 02:03:19,550
He's trying to move traffic on the ground.
It's trying to fuck it.

2090
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:22,120
He's making solar cities like he's,

2091
02:03:22,121 --> 02:03:27,121
he's hooking up Australia with these
massive solar panel power battery plants

2092
02:03:28,590 --> 02:03:33,230
and fucking fix their energy
needs. He's, he's on another level.

2093
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:37,550
No doubt. On another level it's a
different thing, but so is he happy gel?

2094
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:42,020
I don't know. And that's a nice guy
that was hanging around with him.

2095
02:03:42,021 --> 02:03:46,700
He seems happy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah,
it does. There was what is happy, right?

2096
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:49,460
Is He happy in bursts when,
well,

2097
02:03:49,461 --> 02:03:53,260
I guarantee you when I saw him and he was
shooting his fucking flame thrower and

2098
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:57,650
my, my four, Yay. He was happy. You're
four. Yay. Yeah. Right out here, man.

2099
02:03:58,240 --> 02:04:00,140
Yeah.
He had a fucking flame thrower.

2100
02:04:00,141 --> 02:04:02,780
He was tapping that bitch
when he walked into the door.

2101
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:07,520
He's unboxing it in the middle of
this hallway out here got flames.

2102
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:12,550
There's a picture of him standing in
front of the Freak Party sign blown flames

2103
02:04:12,591 --> 02:04:13,870
out freely.

2104
02:04:14,540 --> 02:04:18,920
I fucking guy's a maniac.
Look at the smile on his face.

2105
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:22,250
He can't tell me he's not happy, Bro.
You know what? Look at that smile.

2106
02:04:22,251 --> 02:04:26,990
He's happy as fuck. It's cause he's a
kid, man. Yeah. We're just a lot of ways.

2107
02:04:27,650 --> 02:04:29,780
There's this,
there's this fucking guy,

2108
02:04:29,781 --> 02:04:33,050
I forget his name is doctor a wrap or a
pie or something like that. He's like,

2109
02:04:33,051 --> 02:04:36,470
his French consulting is like some fucking
genius and he's like decoded cultures,

2110
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:38,020
right?
And uh,

2111
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:41,400
every culture he's Dakota and he,
people hire him to consult. Right?

2112
02:04:41,670 --> 02:04:45,180
And like America's code is a,
it's a,

2113
02:04:45,190 --> 02:04:47,580
the verb is to do and the time is now.
Right.

2114
02:04:47,610 --> 02:04:50,940
And we're just kids at the end of
the day. Right. It's like everything.

2115
02:04:50,950 --> 02:04:53,130
We love big tits in America,
right?

2116
02:04:53,490 --> 02:04:57,630
Most popular product is big tits and like
France, most popular project surgeries,

2117
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:00,330
getting tits reduced,
right.

2118
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:02,900
Everything about them is
like precision and like

2119
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:05,410
the food on the plate,
they're most popular plastics.

2120
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:07,300
That's what I was talking to my
buddy and that's what he said.

2121
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:09,760
And maybe it's changed to like
lips or something more common now,

2122
02:05:09,761 --> 02:05:12,160
but maybe the one you have to
go under episode or dark one.

2123
02:05:12,190 --> 02:05:14,950
Don't fuck with your lips ladies.
I like it when they get a little lips.

2124
02:05:14,951 --> 02:05:17,140
If they have not,
if you have a fucking beak,

2125
02:05:17,170 --> 02:05:20,890
but then do you want to have
a little something? You see
the, the thing in there,

2126
02:05:20,891 --> 02:05:24,280
it's like, like let's, you
know, they're extra needy.

2127
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:27,580
There's like something going on. They
wanted the, they wanted their lips to be,

2128
02:05:27,850 --> 02:05:28,151
you know,

2129
02:05:28,151 --> 02:05:31,720
there's like a symmetrical proportion
that your face is supposed to fall into

2130
02:05:31,721 --> 02:05:36,370
this Fibonacci sequence of
numbers and if you get a nose job,

2131
02:05:36,371 --> 02:05:41,050
I look at you and I go, Whoa, what's
wrong with it is like something is wrong.

2132
02:05:41,050 --> 02:05:45,430
It registers wrong in my head because
your face, so like Ari, perfect example.

2133
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:49,120
It's already got a nose job. You're like,
what the fuck is happening here? Yes.

2134
02:05:49,150 --> 02:05:50,260
What's wrong with your face?

2135
02:05:50,550 --> 02:05:54,520
But you've already had like a small
Irish person's nose. He'd be like,

2136
02:05:54,521 --> 02:05:58,180
what is happening here? This doesn't
even make any sense. Not for his face,

2137
02:05:58,910 --> 02:06:03,160
his face. It's that there's a sequence,
like your lips match your face. They,

2138
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:06,380
they match how far your eyes
are a part where your nose is.

2139
02:06:06,490 --> 02:06:09,430
We see a girl and she's a little tiny
little skinny thing with little fingers

2140
02:06:09,550 --> 02:06:11,650
and all of a sudden she's got this yes,

2141
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:14,800
these big weird lips don't we
like things that like stand out.

2142
02:06:14,801 --> 02:06:18,010
Like we like skinny with big
tits. We do drawn to it. Right.

2143
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:21,310
Things are abnormally do most big slot.
It's a trick.

2144
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:23,850
The big tip one is a trick because it,

2145
02:06:23,851 --> 02:06:28,060
it represents like sexual viability.

2146
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:33,130
It represents your ability to breastfeed
a child which is attractive to your

2147
02:06:33,131 --> 02:06:34,690
genes. Doesn't make any sense. Yeah.

2148
02:06:34,691 --> 02:06:39,691
I said you would know that there's a bag
of water underneath her skin that she

2149
02:06:40,121 --> 02:06:44,170
had a tube down her throat taped
to her face. She's half dead.

2150
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:49,440
They're cutting our open with a sharp
knife and scuffing this bag of water under

2151
02:06:50,021 --> 02:06:55,021
the meat of her breast tissue or they're
cutting her nipple often opening up

2152
02:06:56,021 --> 02:07:00,370
like a fucking man hole cover and
pumping that fucker in there. It's crazy.

2153
02:07:00,371 --> 02:07:03,700
Like we know that that's what
happened and we still think it's hot.

2154
02:07:03,830 --> 02:07:08,560
The all those things are nuts.
Chilean bro. Yeah. Yeah. In
here, we can't help it, but

2155
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:13,820
like it bothers me when it's a, but
when it's a fake, but it bothers me.

2156
02:07:14,370 --> 02:07:17,340
Like if there was a way that a girl could
lift weights at the gym and make her

2157
02:07:17,341 --> 02:07:20,760
tits bigger and she went and got
fake tits, wouldn't like him as much.

2158
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:24,600
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh yeah,
yeah, yeah. Knowing you can earn it. Yeah.

2159
02:07:24,601 --> 02:07:29,520
You could earn it. I might. Yeah. It's
lazy. Lazy. Yeah. Yeah. But thing is,

2160
02:07:29,521 --> 02:07:33,360
it throws you off if it doesn't match
the legs. Like if a girl's got a big,

2161
02:07:33,361 --> 02:07:38,020
but it's got some legs, like damn bitch
is dead lift. You know, like that's hot.

2162
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:41,230
Yeah. It's like, I've never said that in
my head, but I know what you're talking.

2163
02:07:41,250 --> 02:07:45,430
You never said this. Bitches deadlift
putting up. I see a girl with big,

2164
02:07:45,780 --> 02:07:50,410
big hamstrings. Bitch could squat.
Death isn't, I say that all the time.

2165
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:51,850
Just don't work out enough.
I guess.

2166
02:07:51,851 --> 02:07:56,200
I was like girls with legs that looked
like ticking carry shit. Yeah, it's hot.

2167
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:57,600
Yeah.
Do you like the girl?

2168
02:07:58,990 --> 02:08:03,190
I'm heavy of the girls carrying me around.
She's going to get tired,

2169
02:08:03,710 --> 02:08:08,640
but it, but I like girls that are
athletic but of power. You know,

2170
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:12,550
I like it. It's hot. So if a girl's
got a big ass cause she's squatting,

2171
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:16,000
that's hot. The girls get a big ass
cause she went through surgery. I'm like,

2172
02:08:16,001 --> 02:08:19,940
bitch, you're going to get cancer
as cancer now. Do you know that

2173
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:27,520
from implants? Yes. They're starting
to see cases of bud cans. Whoa, Jack.

2174
02:08:27,550 --> 02:08:32,130
That's what I'm talking
about son, Bro. That's power.
That's too strong for me. Oh,

2175
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:37,330
don't be scared. I'm afraid of that.
That girl hurt you. Yeah, that is,

2176
02:08:37,390 --> 02:08:40,570
that's like trying to
fuck up crossfitters fist.

2177
02:08:41,830 --> 02:08:45,130
You know what I'm saying?
Like the power she must have in that Bro.

2178
02:08:45,131 --> 02:08:48,220
Look at that leg dude. And
attaches a hawk. Outstanding.

2179
02:08:48,430 --> 02:08:51,550
I mean the butt cheeks or anything.
It's the thigh meat. It's too much.

2180
02:08:51,551 --> 02:08:54,980
He's a athlete. I like it.
Yeah. I don't know like that.

2181
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:56,710
If that girl's in a miniskirt,

2182
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:59,200
but if she's not flexing
Cipro looks hot as fuck you.

2183
02:08:59,201 --> 02:09:04,090
So you were into a very strong, yeah,
I like good jeans, this kind of thing.

2184
02:09:04,091 --> 02:09:08,940
Other ones, Jamie. I mean this
girl has stacked that girl stacked.

2185
02:09:09,130 --> 02:09:14,130
The only problem with those gals is that
there is a reality to certain levels of

2186
02:09:15,191 --> 02:09:20,191
musculature that most likely they're
only achieved by injecting male hormones.

2187
02:09:21,370 --> 02:09:25,990
So the cliques kind of get big or
whatever. Have you never seen that?

2188
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:28,690
Are you allowed to like fuck around?
What's your relationship with your wife?

2189
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:32,440
Definitely not. No. No. No. Okay. Okay.
How long have you been married? 10 years.

2190
02:09:32,470 --> 02:09:37,140
10 years, okay. And then how do you, yeah.

2191
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:39,410
How do you navigate that? No, Jay yet.

2192
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:44,010
Can you please explain to me what need you
do this? Wait, Jack will help. Exactly.

2193
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:48,290
How does it work? Yeah. This,
this level of athleticism.

2194
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:52,960
I was saying like there's like a certain
line that there are, they are crossing,

2195
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:57,910
most likely is because of male hormones.
Yeah. I can't get into it. There's,

2196
02:09:57,911 --> 02:10:00,790
there's some level of that. Did
they grow some hair? Jujitsu girls,

2197
02:10:00,791 --> 02:10:02,530
there's a lot of Jujitsu
girls that are competitive.

2198
02:10:02,531 --> 02:10:04,600
Jiu Jitsu girls that started
doing a little bit of steroids.

2199
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:06,350
They started taking a
little bit of testosterone.

2200
02:10:06,550 --> 02:10:09,920
Like a friend of mine's wife was
doing it and I was like, yikes. Yeah.

2201
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:11,950
She's really getting into a Jujitsu.

2202
02:10:11,951 --> 02:10:15,780
She's competing and she's starting
to take a little bit of testosterone.

2203
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:18,810
I was like, Oh, you know what happens?

2204
02:10:19,510 --> 02:10:22,820
They get horny where he only
like a dude. Really? Yeah,

2205
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:26,860
but they've got this big dangling clay
on or know it only gets big when they go

2206
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:30,160
whole hog.
Like when they go bodybuilder.

2207
02:10:30,340 --> 02:10:34,190
How Nagel bodybuilder big.
No, never way back in the day.

2208
02:10:34,740 --> 02:10:37,970
They never fucked a girl was a
bodybuilder. Never once ever just fuck.

2209
02:10:38,010 --> 02:10:42,470
The girl was like, like very
fit and strong, but she had
a normal vagina. Normal.

2210
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:46,100
Totally normal. She has a six pack
though. It's kind of weird. Okay. Yeah.

2211
02:10:46,101 --> 02:10:50,060
It's a little soft feminine.
But this clip thing fascinates me,

2212
02:10:50,061 --> 02:10:54,740
so declared it just is there like, is
that, you can't put a picture of that up.

2213
02:10:54,741 --> 02:10:59,300
Can we look at that? Can you pull it
up when it doesn't? You know what?

2214
02:10:59,301 --> 02:11:01,400
It is a little Dick. It's like a
little deck. That's what I'm wondering.

2215
02:11:01,401 --> 02:11:06,050
Does it have like the head
and like the race? Oh yeah.
Fuck you ever see here, Bro.

2216
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:09,650
You saying you've never looked at
in large clits you never done that.

2217
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:14,270
It's exactly what I'm saying. If
you've never done it, Google search.

2218
02:11:14,870 --> 02:11:17,050
I looked fake pussies.
I looked up like training pussies,

2219
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:20,870
but I didn't look up and those are good.
What do you mean the training buzzy?

2220
02:11:21,170 --> 02:11:25,010
What do you mean they're not good? Like
date? Sound good. It's not real. Yeah,

2221
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:28,640
I know it's not real, but you want
to be able to tell. Can you tell? No,

2222
02:11:28,641 --> 02:11:32,360
but I feel like there's
a dick on inside and nut.

2223
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:38,290
That one down there.
Yeah.

2224
02:11:38,330 --> 02:11:42,470
That's what happens. It's not real. It
is real. It is real way. No, no, no,

2225
02:11:42,471 --> 02:11:46,850
it is no way. How about that one in the
lower right hand, upper right hand corner.

2226
02:11:47,300 --> 02:11:51,740
The dark one. Jamie below that. That
one. Pow. How'd you like me now?

2227
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:56,630
That's a dick. She has balls. Yeah. No,
no. That's pussy lips, bro. That's not,

2228
02:11:56,631 --> 02:12:00,710
that's not a girl. That's
Paul's lips. Doug Pussy Lips.

2229
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:02,120
Now that one down there.

2230
02:12:02,210 --> 02:12:05,120
What about the giant one below that
Jamie did the ones that middle.

2231
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:09,140
What's happening there? No, Bro,
that just looks like a witch finger

2232
02:12:11,570 --> 02:12:16,160
is gnarly.
That's Photoshop has to be from my dude,

2233
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:21,310
dude. This is awesome. Free Porn. Mm.

2234
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:26,840
Yeah. Oh Dude. Well,

2235
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:31,640
when girls take a lot of testosterone,
they do develop enlarge clits.

2236
02:12:31,850 --> 02:12:35,510
There was a a a show
on HBO back in the day,

2237
02:12:35,511 --> 02:12:39,020
I think it was called private dicks,
but it was like that girl's Jack.

2238
02:12:40,490 --> 02:12:43,280
You're into that though? No,
that's a little much. Yeah.

2239
02:12:43,950 --> 02:12:48,770
Dillashaw yeah, that's hilarious. She's
pretty looking now. She wasn't flexing,

2240
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:53,640
told to eat a couple of sandwiches. Oh.
Anyway, let's get out of there. That's,

2241
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:57,950
that's enough. We're going to
start vomiting mood. But anyway,

2242
02:12:57,951 --> 02:13:02,360
there was a show on HBO called Private
Dicks and one of the people on it,

2243
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:04,670
I think that was from that show,
but anyway,

2244
02:13:04,671 --> 02:13:07,250
there was this lady who was talking about,
she became a,

2245
02:13:07,251 --> 02:13:12,251
a trans man and by through taking
massive amounts of testosterone,

2246
02:13:12,590 --> 02:13:16,910
her clit grew. She said to
the size of a thumb. Yeah,

2247
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:20,110
because they're taking,
I don't even understand what's going on.

2248
02:13:20,110 --> 02:13:25,010
High levels of testosterone to sort of
achieve that. They get hair on their face.

2249
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:27,710
They're boys DPA. Yeah. You know,

2250
02:13:27,711 --> 02:13:31,920
they get broader and thicker and they
keep a lot of that too. I, I don't get it.

2251
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,060
I don't understand. So your clit is just,
your is just a cock essentially, right?

2252
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:40,590
Well, not really. It just resembles
one. I mean if you looked at that,

2253
02:13:40,591 --> 02:13:43,730
if my dick look, I thought I'd go right
to the doctor. I'm like, which one?

2254
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,950
We were looking at the cook
and one which is finger joints.

2255
02:13:47,270 --> 02:13:48,390
It seems like a joint.

2256
02:13:48,420 --> 02:13:51,790
It seems like a club with no skin or
get dick with no skin. It has been.

2257
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:53,633
Yes.

2258
02:13:56,580 --> 02:13:58,590
That made me feel
uncomfortable to look at.

2259
02:13:58,650 --> 02:14:01,230
It should match and pulling
a girl's panties and shit.

2260
02:14:01,231 --> 02:14:06,000
That thing fucking happen to
a friend of mine's boyfriend,

2261
02:14:06,410 --> 02:14:09,240
a friend of mine who I used to
work with on a television show her,

2262
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:13,290
she was the story about her ex boyfriend
met this girl and they're fooling

2263
02:14:13,291 --> 02:14:16,110
around and they get back to her
butt and she was pretty feminine,

2264
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:17,110
but she had a click,

2265
02:14:17,120 --> 02:14:20,550
like a pinky is the way he described it
and then he pulled her pants down and

2266
02:14:20,551 --> 02:14:23,550
then fucking panicked and then said,
oh my God,

2267
02:14:23,551 --> 02:14:26,490
I have to pick my friend up at the
airport. Fuck, I can't believe this.

2268
02:14:26,790 --> 02:14:31,380
And he just, that was his excuse
is I got to pick one panty man.

2269
02:14:31,710 --> 02:14:35,400
The dude panicked. He went into a
full blown panic and just ran out.

2270
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:37,320
He couldn't deal with her clit.

2271
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:40,910
I mean it gets to a certain
size where that's like at, look,

2272
02:14:40,990 --> 02:14:43,300
it's wrapped around her leg
and tied in a bow. You're like,

2273
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:47,010
oh you to like kind of like
push it to the side to insert.

2274
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:52,110
You gotta hold it like a handle
all your banners and choice.

2275
02:14:53,250 --> 02:14:57,510
Fuck it. It's like the,
the reins on a horse,

2276
02:14:57,750 --> 02:15:00,760
like you're hanging onto it.
Where you're bang on. Oh,

2277
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:06,420
it's like just the random shape of the
human body and how we've decided that

2278
02:15:06,421 --> 02:15:10,080
this is what's appealing. Right.
Hourglass figure. The ask comes out,

2279
02:15:10,081 --> 02:15:14,160
the tits are here. It makes it look
like she's like sexually viable.

2280
02:15:14,670 --> 02:15:19,080
She'll be good at like the big ass and
all that fat around that area means she's

2281
02:15:19,081 --> 02:15:23,250
got a plenty, plenty of nutrients
for the child. Got Wide Hips.

2282
02:15:23,251 --> 02:15:24,780
It means a baby's gonna come out easy.

2283
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:29,040
All those things are like
directly connected to fertility.

2284
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:32,250
So we're not objectifying
them at all. Well, we are,

2285
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:34,200
but it's nature that's caught.

2286
02:15:34,201 --> 02:15:39,201
Like there's a reason why the standard
that men are after when it comes to women

2287
02:15:39,871 --> 02:15:43,530
is directly connected to them.
It actually makes some kids,

2288
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:46,140
so me thinking, you know,
you have great, you know,

2289
02:15:46,141 --> 02:15:51,030
hips are tits or something like that
is efficient. Yeah. It's not sexist.

2290
02:15:51,031 --> 02:15:53,940
It's not hateful.
It's not in any way objectifying.

2291
02:15:53,970 --> 02:15:57,810
Or maybe we're supposed to
objectify to create people. Hmm.

2292
02:15:58,530 --> 02:15:59,580
I think there's that too.

2293
02:15:59,581 --> 02:16:02,970
But then there's also like if
a girl's really good shape,

2294
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:06,630
one of the things that you
admire is that that girl's got,

2295
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:09,150
she's got disciplined and power,

2296
02:16:09,390 --> 02:16:13,350
like go girls hitting the gym all the
time and working on all a girl gets things

2297
02:16:13,351 --> 02:16:13,920
done.

2298
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:18,510
Like if you see a girl and she's lazy
and her body is just like soft doughy,

2299
02:16:18,511 --> 02:16:21,780
she's like skinny fat, like, like,
oh, you're going to complain a lot.

2300
02:16:21,810 --> 02:16:24,120
You're going to meet a lot of
naps. Yay. You know what I mean?

2301
02:16:24,121 --> 02:16:26,760
You know it up after this kid
getting after it. Yeah. You know,

2302
02:16:26,770 --> 02:16:30,460
I have to get things done now. You're
going to want to be, you want to be sad,

2303
02:16:30,461 --> 02:16:34,120
you're going to want to complain. You're
going to want to stay home and stop.

2304
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:37,060
But is that biological or is that
a smart, do you think it is? Yeah.

2305
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:38,380
There's something biological to it.

2306
02:16:38,381 --> 02:16:40,780
Your body rejects that because
you know that this girl,

2307
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:44,140
like if the shit hits the fan
and a fucking apocalypse comes,

2308
02:16:44,141 --> 02:16:46,040
you gotta take your children
and go to the mountains. Right.

2309
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:48,370
This girl is going to be tired all
the time. I'm just going to complain.

2310
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:51,130
It's going to weigh you down.
It's not going to carry your own weight.

2311
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:53,770
I'll like a gal who can
carry your own weight. Right,

2312
02:16:53,950 --> 02:16:56,170
and you can't do that if
you're carrying a big old clit

2313
02:16:59,700 --> 02:17:04,590
hurry up, dragging your clit all over
the rocks. We got leaves stuck to it.

2314
02:17:05,110 --> 02:17:05,943
Shit.

2315
02:17:08,490 --> 02:17:12,180
Dog's Dick Dog.

2316
02:17:13,170 --> 02:17:16,780
No, no. Imagine if women had,

2317
02:17:17,010 --> 02:17:21,610
and men had pussies and we were just
really into big dicks to just as possible.

2318
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:25,680
Absolutely called gay guys,
but no,

2319
02:17:25,690 --> 02:17:29,890
the arbitrary shape it like strange,
strange.

2320
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:32,590
You're a trashy.
This isn't the male.

2321
02:17:32,591 --> 02:17:37,090
Seahorses have a pussy while the male
seahorse excepts eggs from the female.

2322
02:17:37,091 --> 02:17:39,520
This actually video of
it sounds pretty great.

2323
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:44,790
That's pretty fucking
gay brown eggs. Yeah. He,

2324
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:49,090
she pours her eggs into a sack
in his body. It's very strange.

2325
02:17:49,610 --> 02:17:52,090
It looks like they're kissing while
they do it. It's really weird, right?

2326
02:17:52,110 --> 02:17:56,170
I'm okay with, Oh, you've got a video
of it. Oh yeah. Here it is. Shit.

2327
02:17:56,171 --> 02:18:00,490
In perspective, when you look at the
weird fucking animal, a sea horses anyway,

2328
02:18:00,850 --> 02:18:05,320
like what a strange little creature.
It's so weird.

2329
02:18:05,321 --> 02:18:07,750
I think that's why we like
nature stuff because it like,

2330
02:18:08,350 --> 02:18:13,170
it puts in perspective how fucked up
humans are. Look at that dude. That's,

2331
02:18:13,190 --> 02:18:18,170
that's her. Him. Is that him giving
birth do, that's how I come with cow.

2332
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:21,670
Look at that kicks back and
shotgun dude come the opposite way.

2333
02:18:21,680 --> 02:18:25,900
I've go forward and I don't get back out.
I feel like if you back on,

2334
02:18:25,901 --> 02:18:27,400
it's like pulling back on a punch.
Yeah.

2335
02:18:27,401 --> 02:18:29,950
But you gotta match one of
those ones that stuck in there.

2336
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:34,930
One of them little baby seahorses is
like, ah, I'm in it forever. Shit.

2337
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:38,920
Cause he's, the last of them is like
the last is like one or two at a time.

2338
02:18:38,921 --> 02:18:43,560
So you're like one guy. Oh
boy. That's the last draw.

2339
02:18:44,350 --> 02:18:48,850
He's just, he keeps popping, but
there's nothing coming out. Okay.

2340
02:18:48,851 --> 02:18:53,780
Those are babies are, those are sperm
babies. So we didn't see them like, uh,

2341
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:58,300
have sex with each other. Maybe
hatches inside of his body. Yeah.

2342
02:18:58,301 --> 02:19:02,580
That's crazy dude. Thank God I got
to do that. I imagine all that.

2343
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:07,480
What a drag. Did your, did your
wife do natural now? See? Oh No, no,

2344
02:19:07,481 --> 02:19:12,160
no, no, no, no. How'd she get it
out? Oh, I mean natural and that,

2345
02:19:12,170 --> 02:19:16,280
but like, yeah, a c section, ga epidural
man. The csection thing, they have to,

2346
02:19:16,290 --> 02:19:18,520
I mean with some women it's
imperative they have to do it.

2347
02:19:18,521 --> 02:19:22,210
Like maybe they have small hips, right?
You date one of those, like a little girl,

2348
02:19:22,211 --> 02:19:25,690
take one of them bent big giant dudes
Grill Fox, you know what I mean?

2349
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:29,100
And then he got a giant baby
side you and a little tiny pussy

2350
02:19:32,070 --> 02:19:32,903
loving.

2351
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:38,270
I am fascinated by it when
like if you ever seen that guy,

2352
02:19:39,590 --> 02:19:42,800
the guy from game of Thrones,
the guy on the mountain,

2353
02:19:42,801 --> 02:19:47,450
the mountain was this little tiny. She's
standing up, she weighs three pounds.

2354
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:51,380
Let's see, she looks like a chick.
She's smaller in comparison to him.

2355
02:19:51,381 --> 02:19:55,430
Then my eight year old is in comparison
to mill. Yup. Look at that. Oh,

2356
02:19:55,431 --> 02:19:57,520
he is smoking that dude.
Oh,

2357
02:19:57,830 --> 02:20:00,650
how is that humanly
possible that that works?

2358
02:20:00,830 --> 02:20:05,480
She's this beautiful little tiny creature
and he's one of the biggest human

2359
02:20:05,481 --> 02:20:08,930
beings on the planet. He's packing. I
don't think he's packing. Are you talking?

2360
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:11,210
I think he's got a big piece.
He's got a dick.

2361
02:20:11,211 --> 02:20:14,540
Like everything else you see on him.
If he didn't have a dick like that,

2362
02:20:14,541 --> 02:20:17,390
you'd be stunned by the size of his hands,
his shoulders.

2363
02:20:17,720 --> 02:20:20,810
He probably has a small seal in his pants.

2364
02:20:25,370 --> 02:20:30,290
He's going to tee shirts. A strong
mother fuckers be like besides Dick?

2365
02:20:30,650 --> 02:20:31,040
Yeah,

2366
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:35,870
big giant fucking ant
eater or on elephant trunk.

2367
02:20:36,130 --> 02:20:37,700
That's, that's, oh wow.

2368
02:20:38,110 --> 02:20:42,800
I don't know if he got the peace man big.
If you had a piece like that.

2369
02:20:42,801 --> 02:20:46,070
He's a savage. She's from fucking
Iceland. That's what they do.

2370
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:49,280
There are different humans out
there, man. Those are vikings.

2371
02:20:49,730 --> 02:20:53,660
There's a reason why he's that big.
No bullshit. That is Viking DNA.

2372
02:20:53,661 --> 02:20:56,060
It's just the best.
Years ago,

2373
02:20:56,090 --> 02:21:00,290
guys like him would be on a boat where
they fucking dragon on the front of the

2374
02:21:00,291 --> 02:21:04,880
boat and they'd have a sword and they
couldn't wait to jump off that fucking

2375
02:21:04,881 --> 02:21:08,510
boat and start hacking people to bits.
That's why that guy exists.

2376
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:12,490
That's why he's so big and you just took
the best genetics from wherever you've

2377
02:21:12,491 --> 02:21:16,090
stopped. It's why Iceland vice did
a whole piece on Iceland. Okay.

2378
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:19,310
But all of the strong men, competition
winners, it live in Iceland.

2379
02:21:19,790 --> 02:21:23,150
They're all vikings. Mad.
It's Viking DNA. Really?

2380
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:28,010
100% okay. But isn't Viking
DNA. Okay? We went to Italy,

2381
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:31,850
we raped some chicks in Italy. We bring
them back. They bring back the best women,

2382
02:21:31,851 --> 02:21:35,830
but they're the ones who survive
all these battles. This is tested

2383
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:42,900
at other duties to survive.

2384
02:21:42,950 --> 02:21:46,460
We're all big. Yeah, that's
true. These guys are so big, man.

2385
02:21:46,530 --> 02:21:51,230
If you got to read this article, had
vice did on these strong men in Iceland.

2386
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:55,310
Okay. It's crazy bro. Yeah, yeah. As
a whole country filled with gorilla

2387
02:21:57,140 --> 02:22:02,140
gorillas that are just smashing pussy
and lifting weights and throwing fucking

2388
02:22:03,320 --> 02:22:07,730
beer barrels over the top of train
link fences there. It's huge.

2389
02:22:07,790 --> 02:22:11,720
There's a apparently that there's an APP
in Iceland to make sure you don't fuck

2390
02:22:11,721 --> 02:22:15,110
your family member that ass bro.
Cause there's only,

2391
02:22:16,630 --> 02:22:20,840
there's only like 300,000 people right on
the island. So everybody, not everybody,

2392
02:22:20,841 --> 02:22:23,480
a lot of people are very related
so you can like type your name in.

2393
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:26,190
Oh say oh your grandson,
all your organs in our

2394
02:22:26,190 --> 02:22:27,900
second cousins family.
Not Fuck.

2395
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:31,590
Oh,

2396
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:37,410
with a drum by the bed.
I got to do beat the drum.

2397
02:22:39,910 --> 02:22:42,660
Boom, boom. The gimme a pace to go to

2398
02:22:44,580 --> 02:22:49,350
jam. That's a crazy, crazy race of
humans, man. You ever go there? No. No.

2399
02:22:49,351 --> 02:22:52,230
I'd like to go. I'd like to go there
just to see the northern lights.

2400
02:22:52,231 --> 02:22:53,820
It's one of the things that
I've been thinking that I need.

2401
02:22:53,821 --> 02:22:57,150
Have you been where you saw them? I didn't
sign up there. What is it? Oh you did?

2402
02:22:57,220 --> 02:23:00,870
Yeah. Normally in Alaska it's harder in
the city when you're just say, but uh,

2403
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:02,340
yeah, they love stand
up there. I think like,

2404
02:23:02,550 --> 02:23:06,180
I think they're they're
president or something. It
was like a huge Stan hope fan.

2405
02:23:06,750 --> 02:23:10,530
They liked good stand up to make sure
I'm not misquoting but like a pair.

2406
02:23:10,531 --> 02:23:13,680
I think he was a like a
massive, a duck. Stan Hope Fan.

2407
02:23:16,020 --> 02:23:20,610
They were good man. They like no English.
They're like apparently the KFC there,

2408
02:23:21,510 --> 02:23:25,110
KFC one KFC, it's popular as fuck. Well,

2409
02:23:25,710 --> 02:23:28,740
the rules for food are super like high,

2410
02:23:29,010 --> 02:23:32,250
so it's like the best chicken
tenders you ever had. Oh,

2411
02:23:32,251 --> 02:23:35,300
because they don't let process bullshit.
None of that. Right, but it's still KFC,

2412
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:39,180
so you could do that when
you have a country that has
as many people as Boulder,

2413
02:23:39,181 --> 02:23:41,070
Colorado.
That's the thing people don't get,

2414
02:23:41,071 --> 02:23:42,510
like when you got to
feed 300 million people,

2415
02:23:42,511 --> 02:23:45,150
it's like we're going to jam out some
shit, Bro. Like we're going to use corn,

2416
02:23:45,620 --> 02:23:49,350
300 million people. It's a lot of people.
It's like when a mom has nine kids,

2417
02:23:49,351 --> 02:23:53,520
it's like it's going to
be some grits. Yeah, yeah.

2418
02:23:53,550 --> 02:23:56,460
Mcdonald's is going to work, but yeah,
Iceland was a shit in the northern lights.

2419
02:23:56,670 --> 02:23:58,500
You look at northern
lights and you're like, oh,

2420
02:23:58,501 --> 02:24:02,190
I completely get why people
believed in God. Oh yeah.

2421
02:24:02,191 --> 02:24:04,800
Like you can't not. Does
that make sense? Sure.

2422
02:24:04,950 --> 02:24:07,710
You look in the sky and
it's painting itself.

2423
02:24:08,280 --> 02:24:11,340
You're going to believe what
did they think it was back then?

2424
02:24:11,370 --> 02:24:14,070
Had to be the gods dancing.
I wonder what they thought.

2425
02:24:14,210 --> 02:24:17,820
I'm wondering what ex explanation
they had for the northern lights.

2426
02:24:17,850 --> 02:24:20,910
How do you not like years ago.
I don't know man.

2427
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:23,880
Sometimes the more I like look at,
I was raised without any religion,

2428
02:24:23,881 --> 02:24:27,180
but like the more I look at it now, I
think it's just people trying to explain.

2429
02:24:28,830 --> 02:24:32,790
It was like, it was like people just
look at that. It's not a real color.

2430
02:24:32,970 --> 02:24:37,260
Minnesota. Yeah. Yeah. You can see
it. Wow. But go to another one for me.

2431
02:24:37,261 --> 02:24:40,360
I didn't experience right.
Guess Novitsky it's more just that name.

2432
02:24:41,070 --> 02:24:43,340
Dirk Nowitzki are probably thinking,
oh no,

2433
02:24:43,350 --> 02:24:46,830
I've heard that name to
Travis Novitsky. Is He, um,

2434
02:24:48,450 --> 02:24:51,930
what's that got to do? Is he just
a famous photographer? Perhaps

2435
02:24:54,550 --> 02:24:58,600
try to follow yeah. Photography
by Travis Novitsky. Yeah,

2436
02:24:58,930 --> 02:25:02,470
I think that's what it is. I
think. I think I've seen his, yeah,

2437
02:25:02,770 --> 02:25:07,520
I think he does a lot of nature
shit. Yup. How could you not dude?

2438
02:25:07,700 --> 02:25:11,240
Like how can you, how do you blame anybody
for, for believing in something bigger?

2439
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:16,370
Oh, just a lightning storm, man. A
hurricane. Like we live in big cities.

2440
02:25:16,371 --> 02:25:17,540
This shit is not real.

2441
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:21,050
You live in The Bahamas and you see
the power of a fucking hurricane.

2442
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:25,420
It puts things in perspective.
You know how important we think we are.

2443
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:30,910
That goes away when you know at
the blink of an eye, your house,

2444
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:35,470
everything you work for is gone
because of wind, wind and water.

2445
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:39,730
Holy Shit. Shit. Right there. Look at that
picture. That's where it's crazy. Wow.

2446
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:40,481
Says Northern.

2447
02:25:40,481 --> 02:25:43,810
The lights now appear in central Europe
and is because of climate change.

2448
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:46,840
Well isn't he supposed to get hotter?
I don't know what that means.

2449
02:25:46,841 --> 02:25:50,230
Like why is it saying well go to
that article. Why is it saying that

2450
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:57,940
northern light now up here.
What? What does that go?
Scroll down. Scroll down. No,

2451
02:25:57,970 --> 02:25:58,601
it says Europe,

2452
02:25:58,601 --> 02:26:03,220
much of the US Central Europe and much
of the U S I didn't know that much of the

2453
02:26:03,221 --> 02:26:06,810
u s says northern lights. You can
see him in Ohio. Sometimes Alaska.

2454
02:26:07,570 --> 02:26:09,910
You can see the norm. You've
seen it. I have not. But um,

2455
02:26:10,150 --> 02:26:12,100
I mean the other picture
you share on an Minnesota,

2456
02:26:12,250 --> 02:26:14,710
you fucking Ohio people do
an ass in the parking lot.

2457
02:26:14,711 --> 02:26:17,110
Seeing the lights in the sky.
Yeah.

2458
02:26:17,111 --> 02:26:21,850
There's that fucking big storm is
hitting central us today. Right? Fuck.

2459
02:26:21,880 --> 02:26:26,880
Then like Denver where they call it a
bomb. A bomb cyclone has it's clickbait.

2460
02:26:27,070 --> 02:26:30,850
Margaret Marketing. Good
marketing. Is it a bomb?

2461
02:26:30,910 --> 02:26:32,140
Like why are they calling it a bomb?

2462
02:26:32,141 --> 02:26:34,560
Because you're going to read
the article of is a bomb, right?

2463
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:37,780
Bombs are scary to marketing's fucking
everything. I thought this shit like,

2464
02:26:38,050 --> 02:26:41,650
like when we were just talking about
the uncircumcised, like, like that.

2465
02:26:41,710 --> 02:26:46,240
Even that term is so dumb,
right? It's a normal dick.
Yeah. Yeah. That's what it is.

2466
02:26:46,241 --> 02:26:51,190
It's a dick. Why don't we, why
would we even use that? Yeah.

2467
02:26:51,360 --> 02:26:55,360
Right. Well, what's crazy is
it, it's more common to be cut.

2468
02:26:56,310 --> 02:27:00,730
You're D it's more common than a dick
is sliced off when you're a baby.

2469
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:06,010
They take the cap off than it is, and
then when it's not, we're like, what's,

2470
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:08,860
why didn't your parents cut your cock
when you were born? What about that?

2471
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:13,120
Why do you have the blanket over the top
of the head? I cut that off. Expose that.

2472
02:27:13,790 --> 02:27:17,950
Dry that head out. Yeah. Weird.
Yeah. It's just sitting there.

2473
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:21,550
You get people to believe anything.
It's like you got to grow it into them.

2474
02:27:21,551 --> 02:27:22,750
You know, there's this, uh,

2475
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:26,140
I feel like I tell the story every
single time talking on podcast,

2476
02:27:26,141 --> 02:27:30,820
but like there's this great thing about
how Nescafe broke into the Japanese

2477
02:27:30,821 --> 02:27:34,210
market. Have you heard about this? And
it's like they went to this consultant,

2478
02:27:34,211 --> 02:27:36,130
they're asking them how do we get in?
And then he's like, you can't get in.

2479
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:39,040
And they're like, what do you mean?
You're saying it's going to be 15 years?

2480
02:27:39,160 --> 02:27:40,630
And I will be talking
about, and he goes, well,

2481
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:43,210
they don't know what the fuck
coffee is over there. Okay,

2482
02:27:43,330 --> 02:27:44,590
you're trying to be tea or not tea.

2483
02:27:44,920 --> 02:27:48,730
So what you're gonna do is you're going
to make a cartoon and you're going to

2484
02:27:48,731 --> 02:27:51,190
spend some few million on that and then
you're gonna make a candy based on a

2485
02:27:51,191 --> 02:27:55,540
cartoon. And then that candy is
going to be flavored as coffee.

2486
02:27:56,230 --> 02:27:57,370
And when these kids grow up,

2487
02:27:59,070 --> 02:28:03,060
they're going to have this memory of
coffee and the flavor of the smell of

2488
02:28:03,061 --> 02:28:03,840
coffee.

2489
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:06,530
And I think last week they just opened
the biggest Starbucks in the world and

2490
02:28:06,531 --> 02:28:10,470
Tokyo and these people
devour coffee like no other.

2491
02:28:10,890 --> 02:28:12,930
And the idea is like the takeaway for me,

2492
02:28:12,931 --> 02:28:14,220
the reason why I tell
the story all the time,

2493
02:28:14,221 --> 02:28:17,820
it's like change comes from underneath,
you know what I mean?

2494
02:28:18,060 --> 02:28:20,760
Is this how they approached it? They
actually did it that way. That's, that's,

2495
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:22,040
that's the same guy,
the

2496
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:25,130
consultant [inaudible] I think his
name is and he's a book or something.

2497
02:28:25,131 --> 02:28:26,120
I'll call the culture code.

2498
02:28:26,121 --> 02:28:28,130
My buddy is doing like a series
with him trying to break it down,

2499
02:28:28,131 --> 02:28:33,131
but the idea is like if you want to change
any same reason why I did my shit on

2500
02:28:33,591 --> 02:28:37,280
youtube, it's like if you want to change
any industry or something like that,

2501
02:28:37,430 --> 02:28:40,280
it's never going to come within
the traditional structure.
You know what I mean?

2502
02:28:40,281 --> 02:28:44,510
It's like I would never be able to do
the type of jokes I was doing on, on.

2503
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:48,410
Maybe you are in the bigs can but me.
They'd be like, I don't that jokes about,

2504
02:28:48,411 --> 02:28:50,240
you know, trans people,
you can do that, et cetera.

2505
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:54,380
So it's like if I want to make it okay,
I got to do it outside.

2506
02:28:55,280 --> 02:29:00,200
You don't have to go a little bit outside
of the industry and make it okay and

2507
02:29:00,230 --> 02:29:01,310
way they were thinking was,
hey,

2508
02:29:01,311 --> 02:29:04,280
let's get underneath and just
fucking grow these ideas in.

2509
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:07,730
That's why we fight wars over
ideas all the time. Right.

2510
02:29:07,731 --> 02:29:09,440
It's like people understand Oh shit,

2511
02:29:09,441 --> 02:29:12,860
and people start believing in socialism
or whatever the new thing they want us

2512
02:29:12,861 --> 02:29:15,440
to be afraid of. Now they believe
in it and it sounds good enough.

2513
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:20,080
They'll want it. So we got to nip
this in the bud and Vietnam, you know,

2514
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:21,560
there's a little bit of that.
I mean,

2515
02:29:21,561 --> 02:29:24,830
Vietnam was super complicated
depending on who you ask.

2516
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:28,940
Most likely it was about heroin, a lot of
the whole war. You think lot of it. Yeah.

2517
02:29:29,090 --> 02:29:33,830
A lot of it was about the heroin trade.
Billions,

2518
02:29:33,830 --> 02:29:35,390
billions and billions and billions of
dollars controlling the heroin trade.

2519
02:29:35,660 --> 02:29:39,650
Really? Yeah. More so then then
the spread of this ideology,

2520
02:29:39,690 --> 02:29:42,350
standards about the heroin trade.
My understanding was w yeah,

2521
02:29:42,351 --> 02:29:45,470
I understood that a little
heroin ramped up radically,

2522
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:49,570
but there's all sorts of
positive aspects to, uh,

2523
02:29:50,060 --> 02:29:53,820
most of the ideas that
they push. Right, right.

2524
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:56,780
There's positive aspects of
trying to stop terrorism.

2525
02:29:56,990 --> 02:30:01,990
There's positive aspects of trying to
stop radical fundamentalists for taking

2526
02:30:02,871 --> 02:30:07,871
over parts of the world and radicalizing
segments of the population and making

2527
02:30:08,301 --> 02:30:11,930
these terrorist cells and attacking
cities and doing a lot of things that we

2528
02:30:11,931 --> 02:30:14,870
know really do happen that that's true,
but what's also true,

2529
02:30:14,960 --> 02:30:17,360
it's a hotbed for heroin,
so it's a win win.

2530
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:22,480
There's a Geraldo Rivera segment on Fox
News where Geraldo Rivera was talking to

2531
02:30:22,790 --> 02:30:27,790
soldiers who were guarding poppy fields
and they were explaining that the US

2532
02:30:28,430 --> 02:30:33,430
soldiers had to guard the fucking heroin
because this is how they got these

2533
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:39,550
Afghany farmers to cooperate against
the radical fundamentalist that were

2534
02:30:40,010 --> 02:30:43,640
running these religious sex.
Watch this shit,

2535
02:30:44,300 --> 02:30:48,920
put the headphones on
fighting the opium trade.

2536
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:55,520
Marsha, this town in the middle of Helmand
province, a province was the easy part.

2537
02:30:55,850 --> 02:30:59,540
The hard part now is governing this
province. A province as you suggest,

2538
02:30:59,780 --> 02:31:02,870
that has become addicted to opium in many,
many ways.

2539
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:07,760
That is the principle of crop that is
being grown here. The Taliban land,

2540
02:31:07,761 --> 02:31:11,180
the farmers, the money, they
are indebted to the Taliban.

2541
02:31:11,330 --> 02:31:15,860
They have to grow the opium now the
marines in their success or in a sense of

2542
02:31:15,861 --> 02:31:20,360
victim of their success. Because
now the population is a, you know,

2543
02:31:20,430 --> 02:31:23,370
they have these OPM fields
and we are tolerating it.

2544
02:31:23,371 --> 02:31:27,690
We are tolerating the cultivation of the
OPM because we know that if we were to

2545
02:31:27,691 --> 02:31:28,800
destroy it now,

2546
02:31:28,980 --> 02:31:32,400
the population were turned against the
marines and it would be a real crazy

2547
02:31:32,401 --> 02:31:35,340
risks. Let me introduce Lieutenant Colonel
Brian Christmas here at the command,

2548
02:31:35,341 --> 02:31:38,190
Yardi for Syrup, the third
battalion, sixth marines. Uh,

2549
02:31:38,250 --> 02:31:41,290
really a wonderful group of marines here.
Cause this a kid,

2550
02:31:41,291 --> 02:31:43,520
I knew him that youtube,
who's going to be a problem this

2551
02:31:44,420 --> 02:31:45,930
now stop now because so,

2552
02:31:46,650 --> 02:31:51,630
but they're getting heavy with heavy
handed against copyright. So isolation,

2553
02:31:51,870 --> 02:31:55,070
this is in spring cause this is this,
is this the gray area we were talking to?

2554
02:31:55,071 --> 02:31:58,680
This was early in the war.
I mean this is like what was that from?

2555
02:31:59,070 --> 02:32:02,640
I want to say that was probably
from 2005. Yeah, dude, this is,

2556
02:32:03,990 --> 02:32:08,040
yeah, this is the gray, right?
This is, hey, this is how
a country makes its money.

2557
02:32:08,070 --> 02:32:11,940
There's,
it's not just that someone's profiting,

2558
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:15,660
there's fucking,
they millions for their GDP.

2559
02:32:15,690 --> 02:32:18,030
Some one is profiting.

2560
02:32:18,060 --> 02:32:20,940
I do not know where the money's all going,

2561
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:25,970
but there are Boone's of dollars
involved in heroin. Right?

2562
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:29,370
Billions people are buying
it all over the world.

2563
02:32:29,430 --> 02:32:33,810
90 something percent of it comes
from Afghanistan. Do the math,

2564
02:32:34,860 --> 02:32:36,870
just do the math.
We're still there.

2565
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:42,060
And Sturgill Simpson wrote a bit about
it or wrote a song about it and they

2566
02:32:42,061 --> 02:32:43,860
played that song on Saturday night live.

2567
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:47,350
And I don't even think they knew what
the fuck the song was about. Right.

2568
02:32:47,480 --> 02:32:51,150
I mean he's up there playing a song about
the government being involved in the

2569
02:32:51,151 --> 02:32:55,410
heroin trade. I mean it's,
there's, there's something to it.

2570
02:32:55,830 --> 02:32:59,640
There's some in and you say, oh,
it's conspiracy theory. Stop,

2571
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:01,253
stop.

2572
02:33:01,260 --> 02:33:06,260
There really is billions of dollars
in heroin being grown in Afghanistan.

2573
02:33:06,510 --> 02:33:11,510
The production of heroin really
did ramp up considerably.

2574
02:33:11,940 --> 02:33:13,510
The US invasion.
Um,

2575
02:33:13,530 --> 02:33:17,160
is it possible that this is their
commerce and country singer goes on,

2576
02:33:17,161 --> 02:33:21,270
SNL exposes Afghan heroin trade and
no one even noticed. That's my boy.

2577
02:33:21,510 --> 02:33:22,570
But he's in terms of Thompson,

2578
02:33:22,740 --> 02:33:27,450
but that this is their commerce and the
same way like some communities fish this

2579
02:33:27,451 --> 02:33:30,360
community plants,
poppies and they perhaps,

2580
02:33:30,870 --> 02:33:33,000
what are they doing with all that money?
That's the question.

2581
02:33:33,130 --> 02:33:36,780
I'm more goats or they get it. Whether
done Afghany go to diligent. I mean

2582
02:33:39,090 --> 02:33:40,440
I don't know what they're doing.
I don't know.

2583
02:33:40,650 --> 02:33:45,650
I just can't imagine someone is not
getting a cut of this and I can't imagine

2584
02:33:46,201 --> 02:33:47,190
that there's no,

2585
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:52,260
might as well just know
mainstream investigative work
that's being done to sort

2586
02:33:52,951 --> 02:33:55,140
of expose this. I don't know.
I mean I might be wrong.

2587
02:33:56,670 --> 02:33:58,830
Maybe these farmers are
not making all the money.

2588
02:33:58,831 --> 02:34:01,620
Maybe the money's all going to drug
dealers and we, we let that happen.

2589
02:34:02,730 --> 02:34:06,120
That'd be fucked up. It'd be cool if it'd
be cool if they got it, but like, look,

2590
02:34:06,121 --> 02:34:10,140
the world is fucked Bro. Like this
shit ain't peaches and cream men.

2591
02:34:10,530 --> 02:34:12,810
It's like every time I see one of these
stupid Senate hearings where they're

2592
02:34:12,811 --> 02:34:17,620
like, did you do some bad things
in South America? Like yeah, yeah.

2593
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:22,000
That shit happens when
Trudeau was involved in that
thing in like a, what is it,

2594
02:34:22,001 --> 02:34:25,630
La, Libya. You know like when they
were bribing. You heard about this,

2595
02:34:26,050 --> 02:34:27,340
Trudeau from Canada,
they're happy.

2596
02:34:27,341 --> 02:34:30,820
There's this big scandal up there in
Canada because he was involved with this

2597
02:34:30,821 --> 02:34:32,500
company,
which is a [inaudible] company that was,

2598
02:34:32,530 --> 02:34:37,530
that paid like $36 million to bribe the
light Libyan government for like some

2599
02:34:38,111 --> 02:34:40,870
contracts and it's like, well, yeah,
that's how shit gets done over there.

2600
02:34:40,871 --> 02:34:44,890
You bribe the government for contracts
and these people in the Canadian

2601
02:34:44,891 --> 02:34:47,860
government, like, how could
he, this is against his
policies. It's like, no, no, no.

2602
02:34:47,861 --> 02:34:52,861
Welcome to the real world that you're
operating in the 1% of the world which has

2603
02:34:52,871 --> 02:34:53,411
these rules.

2604
02:34:53,411 --> 02:34:58,060
We just made the fuck up of fairness
and equality and equity and all this

2605
02:34:58,061 --> 02:35:01,240
bullshit. It's like the real world
is, hey, I'd like to do this.

2606
02:35:01,240 --> 02:35:04,120
Can I give you some money and we
make it happen. The real world is,

2607
02:35:04,570 --> 02:35:08,590
Hello Geraldo Rivera walking into
heroin fields, talking to a general,

2608
02:35:08,710 --> 02:35:13,270
that's the real fucking world.
There's a lot of that. Yeah,

2609
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:17,610
I mean it would be nice if everywhere
was like America, but I don't know if it,

2610
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:22,570
that's what's really fucked up.
Right? Like with this Fairphone shit.

2611
02:35:22,750 --> 02:35:25,080
I don't know if that gets done.
I don't know.

2612
02:35:25,210 --> 02:35:29,880
I don't know if you get an iPhone unless
it's getting made by someone who's

2613
02:35:29,890 --> 02:35:34,270
making $5 a week. I don't know
if you do. And if you do get it,

2614
02:35:34,271 --> 02:35:38,380
how much does it cost? Tons. What is
it like $3,000 how much does it cost?

2615
02:35:38,381 --> 02:35:41,770
How much does an iPhone? Who's going to
pay it? Like you, you already struggling.

2616
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:45,550
You already got two kids, right?
I mean like you bills to pay,

2617
02:35:45,551 --> 02:35:48,760
like you're going to spend $3,000
when you're already struggling.

2618
02:35:49,150 --> 02:35:51,220
We're operating from a place
where we have some excess.

2619
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:55,050
People are trying to make it every
day here. Yeah, they don't give it.

2620
02:35:55,090 --> 02:35:57,010
That's why the election
should is so simple to me.

2621
02:35:57,011 --> 02:36:00,460
Like the Democrats are going to offer
money and republics going to offer jobs

2622
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:04,840
and you see it happening right now it's
like every platform for the Dems on some

2623
02:36:04,841 --> 02:36:07,630
level is here's some money. Hey,
we should look into reparations.

2624
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:10,200
Here's some money. Your boy Yang
who's on here. How long were you?

2625
02:36:10,210 --> 02:36:14,200
Just give everybody $1,000 here's
some money just giving money, right?

2626
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:17,470
Let's break up Facebook and
the Dah, Dah, Dah. Well,

2627
02:36:17,471 --> 02:36:19,150
that's one of the reasons
why for hardworking people,

2628
02:36:19,151 --> 02:36:22,900
the Republicans are so attractive.
Even though a lot of people,

2629
02:36:22,901 --> 02:36:25,350
they fall into a lower
income community like that,

2630
02:36:26,770 --> 02:36:28,150
they're not these rich cats.

2631
02:36:28,870 --> 02:36:33,070
They would think there would be looking
to have like big, big business succeed,

2632
02:36:33,310 --> 02:36:38,310
but the messages that you roll up your
sleeves and you get to work and that you

2633
02:36:38,351 --> 02:36:41,860
work hard, you don't get a
free ride. And they liked that.

2634
02:36:42,130 --> 02:36:47,130
And that's also one of the reasons why
people that are Republicans are more

2635
02:36:47,591 --> 02:36:51,280
likely to be involved in churches and
a lot of church going organizations

2636
02:36:51,281 --> 02:36:54,370
because that's where their community
comes from. And the community support,

2637
02:36:54,690 --> 02:36:57,190
instead of getting community
support from the government,

2638
02:36:57,420 --> 02:37:00,720
you get community support from local
churches as a good point. Yeah.

2639
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:05,440
So you have your support, you have
your, we all need that man. Yeah.

2640
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:07,960
That's something that really
is missing with atheists.

2641
02:37:08,380 --> 02:37:12,340
Yes community and they're miserable.
They're,

2642
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:15,980
I've never met this happy atheists.
It's like they're

2643
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:20,920
vegans. It's like, stop
convincing me that God has don't,

2644
02:37:20,921 --> 02:37:24,830
if you believe it, we're good.
You don't need to convince me.

2645
02:37:25,250 --> 02:37:29,330
If you are trying to convince me, it's
because you don't believe it. Well,

2646
02:37:29,331 --> 02:37:31,730
it's not that they don't believe it,
it's just that they're vibrant.

2647
02:37:31,790 --> 02:37:34,280
They're overzealous.
Dude.

2648
02:37:34,850 --> 02:37:38,120
What do people who are overzealous or
overcompensating for something, right.

2649
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:41,090
A lot of times,
what do you overcompensating for with God?

2650
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:43,100
Cause you know shit is bigger than you.

2651
02:37:43,430 --> 02:37:45,920
Cause you fucking look up sometimes and
you're looking at the stars and you're

2652
02:37:45,921 --> 02:37:49,250
like fuck, something's up. I don't know
what it is. I don't know if it's God,

2653
02:37:49,251 --> 02:37:53,420
I don't know. If it's aliens, I don't know
what's going on. But you are minuscule.

2654
02:37:53,650 --> 02:37:57,230
Yeah. And that's hard for
people to take man. It's like,

2655
02:37:57,710 --> 02:37:59,960
well you think that's why they're
really into pushing atheism.

2656
02:38:00,110 --> 02:38:04,040
I think it's cause the religion that
they see you so offensively stupid.

2657
02:38:05,090 --> 02:38:08,480
I mean, look, there was a funny thing
that happened the other day where it,

2658
02:38:08,481 --> 02:38:11,360
Pete Davidson did a joke on SNL,

2659
02:38:11,390 --> 02:38:14,630
right about the Catholic Church and the
Catholic Church demanded an apology,

2660
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:17,840
right? We're giving him, yeah,
you're the forgiveness people.

2661
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:19,580
Why do you need an apology?

2662
02:38:19,610 --> 02:38:22,730
How bout he made a joke about child
molesting and you guys are the number one

2663
02:38:22,731 --> 02:38:24,380
kid fucking organization in the world.

2664
02:38:24,530 --> 02:38:28,520
How long can stop worrying about jokes
at paying attention to the fact that you

2665
02:38:28,521 --> 02:38:33,521
basically run a kid fucking organization
that also sells Jesus Kff can fucking

2666
02:38:34,011 --> 02:38:35,630
factory, bro. That's how it is, man.

2667
02:38:35,880 --> 02:38:39,830
And a lot of ways and but at the same
time there's the gray area because they do

2668
02:38:39,831 --> 02:38:43,070
a lot of fucking good. Yes. They
say that a lot of people's lives,

2669
02:38:43,071 --> 02:38:47,630
they feed a lot of people,
right? So it's like they,

2670
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:50,940
they give people community that
give people a place to connect. Yes.

2671
02:38:51,110 --> 02:38:53,570
We're in the most connected time in
history and where the most fucking

2672
02:38:53,571 --> 02:38:55,220
disconnected, right? Think about that.

2673
02:38:55,250 --> 02:38:58,820
We've got a million friends on Facebook
and all these other things and people

2674
02:38:58,821 --> 02:39:02,390
are lonely because we're connected
with electronic devices, connect with,

2675
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:05,720
we're not connected with
life. Right. And, and we're,

2676
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:08,480
and we're connected to outcome,
right. We're connected to hope.

2677
02:39:08,481 --> 02:39:11,600
Did this picture I post get
enough likes. Yeah. Right.

2678
02:39:12,290 --> 02:39:14,780
That's where they really
fucked people with likes.

2679
02:39:15,470 --> 02:39:20,390
Once they figured out how to get people
like supremely addicted to interactions

2680
02:39:20,391 --> 02:39:24,620
and exchanges and likes, man, dude,
you know, when like, you know,

2681
02:39:24,621 --> 02:39:27,920
movies in the morning you wake up and
he'd smoke a cigarette [inaudible] right?

2682
02:39:27,940 --> 02:39:30,050
Like that was what the
movies we watched coming up.

2683
02:39:30,051 --> 02:39:33,200
And that was the first thing that the
bad ass or something like that did in the

2684
02:39:33,201 --> 02:39:35,410
movie. Wake up, roll over
on to the pack, you know,

2685
02:39:35,630 --> 02:39:39,890
whatever it will be looking at your phones
mentions there's going to be some of

2686
02:39:39,891 --> 02:39:44,000
that that's going to be what
these characters do. Yup. Yup.

2687
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:49,160
So it's like, what do you,
do you got kids? Do you take,
do you say no? How do you,

2688
02:39:49,370 --> 02:39:51,530
how do you teach your kid? I
don't have kids. I don't know.

2689
02:39:51,650 --> 02:39:53,360
But like I think about this all the time,

2690
02:39:53,361 --> 02:39:58,361
how do I teach my kid to not put his
whole fucking value in the hands of get

2691
02:39:59,811 --> 02:40:04,500
them involved in sports? Because you
learn, you learn reality. Reality. Yeah.

2692
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:09,050
You, if you don't get that ball
in the net, it does not score.

2693
02:40:09,650 --> 02:40:14,070
You know? There's no points for effort.
Yeah, there's no you don't. It doesn't

2694
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:14,903
work that way.

2695
02:40:14,910 --> 02:40:19,910
You got to learn what real life is
and you got to learn that there is,

2696
02:40:20,550 --> 02:40:22,830
it's feels uncomfortable to fail,

2697
02:40:22,980 --> 02:40:27,980
but that uncomfortable feeling that you
get is fuel and then let your kids fail.

2698
02:40:28,950 --> 02:40:32,160
Will you let them fall on their face?
They fall on the first all the time.

2699
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:36,780
My kids do sports. You know, there've
been involved in athletics in some form,

2700
02:40:36,781 --> 02:40:40,170
whether it's martial arts or
gymnastics since they were little.

2701
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:43,680
They do things that are difficult. We
do stuff as a family that are difficult.

2702
02:40:43,830 --> 02:40:48,210
We do like escape rooms. We play
games, we do things that are hard.

2703
02:40:48,330 --> 02:40:51,960
I don't let them win. Yeah.
I mean, my, my little one,

2704
02:40:51,961 --> 02:40:56,010
I let her win sometimes and stuff like
we play carnival games against each other

2705
02:40:56,011 --> 02:40:57,630
or something like that. I'll
let it, carnival games. Yeah.

2706
02:40:57,631 --> 02:41:01,020
Like go to like a circus circus.
Like when I was in Vegas,

2707
02:41:01,021 --> 02:41:02,880
I was in Vegas for this thing
that my daughter was doing.

2708
02:41:02,881 --> 02:41:06,210
So I took my youngest daughter circus
circus playing these carnival games. Okay.

2709
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:10,470
How let her beat me a bunch of times.
But that's,

2710
02:41:10,650 --> 02:41:15,600
we're having fun laughing and being silly,
talking trash to each other too. Yes.

2711
02:41:15,900 --> 02:41:18,720
She, high fives means
stuff. It's fun. But uh,

2712
02:41:19,020 --> 02:41:24,020
I think there's value in learning that
it sucks to lose because that makes you

2713
02:41:24,391 --> 02:41:28,530
reassess like what you did that the
other person did better and how do I beat

2714
02:41:28,531 --> 02:41:30,360
them? Yeah. It's like when
we're talking about weed,

2715
02:41:30,390 --> 02:41:33,780
but weed making you nervous and
makes you paranoid. Like I like that.

2716
02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:38,020
What I like is, look, I'm
entirely too successful. I like,

2717
02:41:38,180 --> 02:41:42,830
I like to feel vulnerable. I think
there's a lot of good to that. You know,

2718
02:41:42,900 --> 02:41:46,940
like legitimately I liked that
feeling because it makes me, um,

2719
02:41:47,130 --> 02:41:50,490
it makes me more connected.
It makes me more humble.

2720
02:41:50,670 --> 02:41:52,650
What do you mean you're too successful?
Well,

2721
02:41:52,651 --> 02:41:57,090
you can only have so much success in
this life for you start thinking that

2722
02:41:57,091 --> 02:41:59,010
you're different than other people.
You know,

2723
02:41:59,011 --> 02:42:03,810
it's you thinking that you're
something special. No, he,
look, if you're on a path,

2724
02:42:03,811 --> 02:42:04,111
right?

2725
02:42:04,111 --> 02:42:07,380
If everybody's on a path and you start
off here and then x amount of years later

2726
02:42:07,381 --> 02:42:09,870
your way away, you could
start thinking, oh,

2727
02:42:09,871 --> 02:42:12,600
I'm better than all those motherfuckers.
Yeah, but you're not, you're just,

2728
02:42:12,601 --> 02:42:16,710
you just have been on this path longer
and you haven't fallen off of it.

2729
02:42:16,950 --> 02:42:19,380
You've figured out what you
need to do to stay on that path.

2730
02:42:19,500 --> 02:42:23,460
We know a lot of people that were on
the path at one time in their career and

2731
02:42:23,461 --> 02:42:24,400
then something happened.

2732
02:42:24,420 --> 02:42:27,810
They lost their enthusiasm or their body
wasn't as healthy or whatever the fuck

2733
02:42:27,811 --> 02:42:31,130
happened and they dropped off.
I'm still on that path. Why?

2734
02:42:31,980 --> 02:42:35,940
Because I figured it out. What does it
keep going? Keep going. Don't be a pussy.

2735
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:39,390
Keep working.
Improve objectively,

2736
02:42:39,391 --> 02:42:42,810
analyze your performance.
Look at what you're doing wrong.

2737
02:42:43,390 --> 02:42:45,240
Treat everything with respect.

2738
02:42:45,510 --> 02:42:50,010
Treat all of your endeavors with
focus and intensity and intention.

2739
02:42:50,310 --> 02:42:54,510
Look at what you're doing and
pay attention and do the work.

2740
02:42:54,540 --> 02:42:57,810
Do the Goddamn work. Do the writing,
do the performing the, you'll see me,

2741
02:42:57,811 --> 02:43:02,400
I'll do four or five sets a night in La
and I'm doing 1520 minutes, half hour.

2742
02:43:02,401 --> 02:43:04,920
I'll do an hour here.
I'll go down the ice house.

2743
02:43:04,921 --> 02:43:08,130
We'll do an hour ice house and doing
two shows, the Ice House tomorrow night.

2744
02:43:08,450 --> 02:43:12,460
And I'm, I'm, I go, whoa. I
go, well, there's no excuses.

2745
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:16,900
I go and now it's like the, to me, the
way I've got it set up, it's great.

2746
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:20,530
My kids go to bed. By the time my
kids are in bed, I leave, you know,

2747
02:43:20,570 --> 02:43:23,920
I say goodnight night, tuck them in. I'm
out the door, I'm headed to the club.

2748
02:43:24,280 --> 02:43:27,430
I'm home in four hours, you know,
and when I'm, when I'm done,

2749
02:43:27,460 --> 02:43:31,660
I get in front of the computer and I
write, I write, I get up in the morning,

2750
02:43:31,690 --> 02:43:36,280
I see him off to school, go back to sleep
or I go to the gym, I get things done,

2751
02:43:36,370 --> 02:43:40,690
keep moving, got to keep
moving. My job is the task.

2752
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:43,720
It's like my job is,
I'm trying to,

2753
02:43:43,721 --> 02:43:48,610
like right now it's most exciting
time for me, uh, in my career arc,

2754
02:43:48,640 --> 02:43:52,930
my, uh, my, my comedy arc because
my comedy arc is put out a special,

2755
02:43:52,931 --> 02:43:55,180
it's very exciting when
you're putting out a special,

2756
02:43:55,240 --> 02:43:59,110
but then the most exciting time is, you
know, my special came out in October.

2757
02:43:59,140 --> 02:44:03,230
So then those months afterwards where
it's this mad rush to create a new,

2758
02:44:03,590 --> 02:44:08,590
a new hour and solidifying perspectives
and honing material and uncovering new

2759
02:44:10,631 --> 02:44:15,631
layers and looking at it and reanalyze
it and stepping back and listening to a

2760
02:44:15,651 --> 02:44:18,700
drunk and listening to
it's sober and, and, and,

2761
02:44:18,701 --> 02:44:21,010
and smoking weed and going over it again.

2762
02:44:21,010 --> 02:44:25,000
And just spending time mashing the keys,
spending time,

2763
02:44:25,001 --> 02:44:29,610
looking at the notes that you can type
your stuff, you know? Yeah, yeah. Type.

2764
02:44:29,730 --> 02:44:30,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

2765
02:44:31,930 --> 02:44:34,910
It's very valuable to be able to type
because you can get out your thoughts way

2766
02:44:34,911 --> 02:44:35,950
quicker than you can writing.

2767
02:44:36,910 --> 02:44:40,570
Writing makes you remember it better than
you remember it better when you write

2768
02:44:40,571 --> 02:44:44,260
it down physically on paper.
So if you look at my notebooks,
I, I'm like a maniac.

2769
02:44:44,261 --> 02:44:48,250
I write the same thing over and over and
over again cause I'm just writing down

2770
02:44:48,251 --> 02:44:52,390
my sets, running down my bits and the
key parts of the bits so that I have,

2771
02:44:52,391 --> 02:44:54,070
I'm solid in my brain,

2772
02:44:54,370 --> 02:44:59,370
but my writing in terms of like my most
prolific creation of things that I never

2773
02:45:00,881 --> 02:45:05,440
thought of before comes out writing
with a keyboard, writing on a computer.

2774
02:45:05,470 --> 02:45:08,680
But can you write how you speak?
Nope, but I don't have to.

2775
02:45:08,740 --> 02:45:13,180
So it's just how you come up with gems.
Gems is here and then you flat say form.

2776
02:45:13,900 --> 02:45:16,910
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah.

2777
02:45:16,920 --> 02:45:20,550
I was going to write a bit about
Geraldo Rivera in the poppy seeds.

2778
02:45:20,920 --> 02:45:22,060
I would smoke a joint.

2779
02:45:22,210 --> 02:45:26,740
Right now it's sit down and I would
just go Geraldo Rivera with his porn

2780
02:45:26,741 --> 02:45:27,461
mustache,

2781
02:45:27,461 --> 02:45:32,461
strolling around these trained killers
and Afghanistan wearing his goofy ass

2782
02:45:32,591 --> 02:45:34,990
fucking tie.
I wonder how those dudes,

2783
02:45:35,090 --> 02:45:39,400
and not as I think of what else to do
is think about strutting around puffing

2784
02:45:39,401 --> 02:45:41,110
his chest out,
hanging around.

2785
02:45:41,111 --> 02:45:44,530
All these guys have been blowing people's
brains outs for the last six months

2786
02:45:44,710 --> 02:45:49,710
protecting America while they're also
simultaneously protecting heroin like hey

2787
02:45:50,381 --> 02:45:54,610
on is that when your boy gets shot
protecting a fucking heroin field and it

2788
02:45:54,611 --> 02:45:55,820
doesn't even make it into the paper.

2789
02:45:55,821 --> 02:45:59,440
And then I'll just start going and going
and going and going and I might type

2790
02:45:59,441 --> 02:46:01,660
out a few thousand words
and then when I go back,

2791
02:46:01,661 --> 02:46:06,220
I might have two lines or a or a seed.

2792
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:10,040
Then I'll take that seed on stage
and then I'll to see if I could water

2793
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:13,830
that bitch or if it's toxic
and I don't know, you know,

2794
02:46:13,831 --> 02:46:17,380
know how long will you give the toxic?
That depends pens on the bits.

2795
02:46:17,381 --> 02:46:20,150
Some bits are just juicy right
out of the box. Some bits,

2796
02:46:20,151 --> 02:46:23,790
you just start them up and you're like,
oh, we got one kid. Yeah. You know,

2797
02:46:23,791 --> 02:46:27,920
and then it's the ones that like,
what about the ones that don't work?

2798
02:46:27,921 --> 02:46:30,260
But you know, there's something
there. Oh, you've seen it.

2799
02:46:30,290 --> 02:46:33,650
How long will you want pens
on? How, how intense it is.

2800
02:46:33,830 --> 02:46:36,250
Depends on what's there for me. Like, uh,

2801
02:46:36,440 --> 02:46:41,420
I had this bit about Bruce Jenner.
Like what really happened?

2802
02:46:41,740 --> 02:46:43,760
Like with Bruce Jenner,
you know,

2803
02:46:43,761 --> 02:46:48,761
and I had to try to figure out how do I
make fun of this guy becoming a woman?

2804
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:53,120
How do I do this? Like, how do I,
how do I figure out how to do this?

2805
02:46:53,360 --> 02:46:57,950
And the way to do it for me was to make
fun of myself living with all women

2806
02:46:58,070 --> 02:47:00,740
because I have a wife and I have three
daughters and it's like this little all

2807
02:47:00,741 --> 02:47:02,360
is feminine energy around me.

2808
02:47:02,361 --> 02:47:06,440
And like that they didn't diminish my
manhood so that I had this like that.

2809
02:47:06,441 --> 02:47:09,350
I've never been happier. But yeah, I've
never been more of a bitch my life.

2810
02:47:09,690 --> 02:47:14,630
And I had this whole long path.
And then it got to, you know,

2811
02:47:14,631 --> 02:47:17,120
I've never been more of a bitch in
my life, but I'm telling you this,

2812
02:47:17,390 --> 02:47:19,140
I'm not going out like Bruce Jenner.
Boom.

2813
02:47:19,220 --> 02:47:23,540
And the whole thing was people were
like, someone's got a fucking sad. I go,

2814
02:47:23,900 --> 02:47:27,920
everyone's like, oh, he's a woman trapped
in a man's body. I'm like, maybe, maybe.

2815
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:33,160
Or maybe if you live with crazy bitches
long enough, you fucking, they come off.

2816
02:47:34,060 --> 02:47:37,540
And then I,
then I got into this whole bit about the,

2817
02:47:37,541 --> 02:47:42,020
the Kardashians becoming like these
gargoyles and hovering over his bed and

2818
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:44,000
talking to him while he's sleeping.
And he's,

2819
02:47:46,240 --> 02:47:50,840
if I had to figure out a way to do that
bit right, it took a long time. Yeah.

2820
02:47:50,841 --> 02:47:53,870
There's a, I thought that's
something I would love people,

2821
02:47:53,930 --> 02:47:55,760
I would love for people to know I do this.

2822
02:47:55,761 --> 02:47:59,090
Should I do this show called inside jokes
where I just get comics to come and we

2823
02:47:59,210 --> 02:48:03,750
take our most divisive premises, don't
look and we work it out together. And um,

2824
02:48:03,810 --> 02:48:06,870
and it'd be so cool to do with you,
man. We'll do it. I'll definitely do it.

2825
02:48:07,580 --> 02:48:12,080
Chris rock went through that with his,
probably one of his most famous bit.

2826
02:48:12,590 --> 02:48:16,730
His mom's faint. One of his most famous
bits is, I love black people. I hate

2827
02:48:18,440 --> 02:48:21,730
that bit is one of his most
popular all the time bits.

2828
02:48:21,740 --> 02:48:26,570
He told me he bombed with that for a year.
Yeah. A year. Yeah. Said he couldn't,

2829
02:48:26,571 --> 02:48:29,570
he couldn't get it to work because
Chris is a fucking workhorse system.

2830
02:48:29,571 --> 02:48:30,620
People don't know about Chris Man.

2831
02:48:30,621 --> 02:48:33,320
Like it's a great story that
exposed everything about him.

2832
02:48:33,321 --> 02:48:37,580
He was filming his special at the Apollo
in New York and there was an after

2833
02:48:37,581 --> 02:48:41,330
party for his own special that he left
so that he could go work on that set at

2834
02:48:41,331 --> 02:48:45,710
the strip. Wow. So that's work.

2835
02:48:46,330 --> 02:48:47,300
Right. So you got to do, man,

2836
02:48:47,910 --> 02:48:50,330
the guy didn't become one of the
biggest hangups of all time by,

2837
02:48:50,340 --> 02:48:53,870
it seems like they shouldn't, they
shouldn't kept works cabbies out there.

2838
02:48:54,590 --> 02:48:57,380
It makes you tired. Exhausting.
Yeah. Yeah. And I'll get it.

2839
02:48:57,381 --> 02:48:59,720
You can jog with him.

2840
02:48:59,721 --> 02:49:03,470
It's like he's like our joke
version of the Rock, you know?

2841
02:49:04,110 --> 02:49:06,830
You know what I'm saying? Like,
cause he fucking never, never.

2842
02:49:07,350 --> 02:49:08,340
It's all private jets,

2843
02:49:08,360 --> 02:49:12,720
Jetson hitting the gym and fucking
concerts in front of 50 million people.

2844
02:49:13,380 --> 02:49:17,380
It's the same shit man.
Like this isn't an accident once would,

2845
02:49:17,490 --> 02:49:20,540
what an is an accident.
They get exposed.

2846
02:49:20,910 --> 02:49:23,070
The ones that are faking the funk boy.

2847
02:49:23,071 --> 02:49:26,640
That's the reason why Netflix took out
the fucking thumbs up, thumbs down,

2848
02:49:27,030 --> 02:49:29,660
you know all that shit.
Remember when they did like you,

2849
02:49:29,820 --> 02:49:32,550
cause there was a few of
those specials that look this,

2850
02:49:32,551 --> 02:49:35,700
their special needs that
have been on comedy on Hbo.

2851
02:49:41,730 --> 02:49:45,270
Youtube is interesting because they
still have this thumbs up, thumbs down,

2852
02:49:45,450 --> 02:49:49,200
you know which people do game.
But the reality of that thumbs up,

2853
02:49:49,201 --> 02:49:52,980
thumbs down is you get to see what the
fuck people really think. Absolutely.

2854
02:49:53,010 --> 02:49:54,130
To a certain extent you think,

2855
02:49:54,900 --> 02:49:58,980
I think it's 100% bullshit
at this point it was useful.

2856
02:49:58,981 --> 02:50:02,070
But now back to your point that you have,

2857
02:50:02,110 --> 02:50:04,920
you have a whole bit about how
many thumbs up and thumbs down.

2858
02:50:04,921 --> 02:50:07,180
Have you ever clicked on zero?
Right.

2859
02:50:07,560 --> 02:50:11,100
So a certain subset of the population
has thumbs up and thumbs down. It's like,

2860
02:50:11,160 --> 02:50:13,700
well it's like yellow
leave comments. Yeah, yeah.

2861
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:15,690
Or write reviews for fucking food.

2862
02:50:15,930 --> 02:50:19,890
I think if you were to magical a
bit about that, doe does a good,

2863
02:50:19,891 --> 02:50:22,050
a good bit of both. I forget
wake, I don't want to butcher it,

2864
02:50:22,051 --> 02:50:24,420
but if something about
like someone left like a,

2865
02:50:24,450 --> 02:50:29,450
like a three out of five review and it's
like who the fuck are you like I get if

2866
02:50:29,581 --> 02:50:32,250
you loved it or you hated it.
But

2867
02:50:34,080 --> 02:50:35,470
to write about this,

2868
02:50:35,471 --> 02:50:40,260
some people fancy themselves to
be like foodies and a journalist,

2869
02:50:40,530 --> 02:50:44,760
you know,
exploring the subtle nuances of cuisine.

2870
02:50:44,790 --> 02:50:46,770
If you're hungry, it's good. It is.

2871
02:50:46,771 --> 02:50:50,880
But when you see a guy like Andrew
Zimmerman traveling around the world doing

2872
02:50:50,881 --> 02:50:54,290
that or you see Anthony Bordain
or a lot of these people you take,

2873
02:50:54,390 --> 02:50:57,690
I want to be like Lens for culture
though, right? It was like,

2874
02:50:57,750 --> 02:51:00,660
it was more than just food. It was like,
what does this food say about the people?

2875
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:03,480
Some of the other guy like, like I
mean, I don't know Zimmer, what is it?

2876
02:51:03,481 --> 02:51:05,580
The weird food guy.
First of all,

2877
02:51:05,610 --> 02:51:10,610
he looks like a salmon and it's just
weird to like just fucking stare at this

2878
02:51:10,891 --> 02:51:15,660
guy. Then like it's just
odd when you look at them,

2879
02:51:15,690 --> 02:51:20,190
right? Yeah. It's just, I don't just make
it as way up fish ladders trying to get,

2880
02:51:20,191 --> 02:51:23,220
he's trying to get all the stream,
I suppose the sand.

2881
02:51:24,510 --> 02:51:28,550
I would say a tuna. Okay. He's
got a little tune in him. Hmm.

2882
02:51:29,490 --> 02:51:32,760
Handsome fellow. Gorgeous.
Could be on a bill.

2883
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:39,000
Um, anyway. Yeah. I don't
know why the fuck they're
leaving these things, but it's,

2884
02:51:39,050 --> 02:51:39,440
you know,
they,

2885
02:51:39,440 --> 02:51:42,750
some people want is they invested so
much money in certain things that we're

2886
02:51:42,751 --> 02:51:44,100
getting down likes and I was like,
all right.

2887
02:51:45,620 --> 02:51:49,380
Like I guess they were doing
it with Starz, right? Was
it stars with Netflix? Yeah.

2888
02:51:49,670 --> 02:51:52,470
Yeah.
They pulled the star system too bad.

2889
02:51:52,471 --> 02:51:54,870
I had a lot of motherfucking stars pitch.
Yeah.

2890
02:51:54,871 --> 02:51:58,110
People are going to watch your people
are going to watch yours regardless.

2891
02:51:58,111 --> 02:52:00,420
I think you give them an
add value and added value.

2892
02:52:01,250 --> 02:52:03,900
He said there's certain people that
give Netflix the added value and there's

2893
02:52:03,901 --> 02:52:05,980
certain people that want the
value from it. It's also,

2894
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:09,790
they're documenting some of the greatest
standup specials in the history of

2895
02:52:09,791 --> 02:52:13,210
stand up. There's like the Chappelle
specials, the two recent ones that he did.

2896
02:52:13,450 --> 02:52:15,300
They're putting that stuff
out there and they're,

2897
02:52:15,301 --> 02:52:18,820
they're doing it in a way where
no one else would do it. Like Hbo,

2898
02:52:18,821 --> 02:52:21,180
which was the gold standard
for the longest time. Yeah.

2899
02:52:21,190 --> 02:52:24,610
They would never do two Dave
Chappelle specials at the same time.

2900
02:52:24,850 --> 02:52:29,200
Netflix is like, okay, we'll do Dave's
like, I got this new shit I want to do.

2901
02:52:29,470 --> 02:52:32,110
I'm going to do it in the belly
room at the comedy store. You know,

2902
02:52:32,111 --> 02:52:36,480
and Dave was so ridiculous about it.
Dave and I were downstairs. Yeah.

2903
02:52:36,820 --> 02:52:40,640
While he was doing this, while he was
filming this, we're downstairs, uh,

2904
02:52:40,690 --> 02:52:45,150
or the in the smoking area of the
comic store getting high as fuck. Yeah.

2905
02:52:45,370 --> 02:52:48,070
And he was so casual about is like,
hey man,

2906
02:52:48,071 --> 02:52:52,600
you want to do it set like you did the
bird? No, no, no. I just want to watch.

2907
02:52:52,900 --> 02:52:54,920
I said, no, no. I did three
sets a night. I go, I'm,

2908
02:52:54,940 --> 02:52:56,590
I'm just going to chill and hang
out in the back of the room.

2909
02:52:56,710 --> 02:53:00,820
But he was so relaxed.
Like during his special being taped,

2910
02:53:01,030 --> 02:53:04,770
he's offering me a guest set. He's
like, hey man, I'll do it set. You know,

2911
02:53:04,780 --> 02:53:09,670
he still shows up. He'll fly to places
and show up and just do guests sets.

2912
02:53:09,671 --> 02:53:12,890
Yeah. I was in Denver. I
come out the green room,

2913
02:53:12,930 --> 02:53:16,530
it's Friday night and Chappelle's there
and chapels in the green room and I go

2914
02:53:16,531 --> 02:53:19,390
there. He goes, hey Joe. I go,
what are you doing this? Oh Man.

2915
02:53:19,391 --> 02:53:23,260
It's felt like coming to Denver. I go,
you want to do a set? It's like, oh yeah,

2916
02:53:23,261 --> 02:53:27,550
fuck it. So I bring him up on stage. The
audience is leaving. They're leaving.

2917
02:53:27,860 --> 02:53:31,390
Can I come back? It's your pals here.
They're like, what's, yeah. Yeah.

2918
02:53:31,391 --> 02:53:34,650
Everybody comes back. He does 40
minutes. It was amazing cause it's,

2919
02:53:35,290 --> 02:53:38,140
that's how he's doing it. He's
like, he's doing it for the art.

2920
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:40,270
He's not doing it because
he's making any money.

2921
02:53:40,570 --> 02:53:44,670
He did a free 40 minute show for these
people that came there to see me. Yeah.

2922
02:53:44,750 --> 02:53:48,430
Fucking loves it and loves it. And he
hits, it's like true with him, man.

2923
02:53:48,670 --> 02:53:50,350
He's a perfect example of that.
Just being true.

2924
02:53:50,410 --> 02:53:55,210
He'll show up Monday night at the comedy
store in front of 13 people and he'll

2925
02:53:55,211 --> 02:53:58,840
go on stage. I'll do a half an
hour in front of 13 people. Yeah.

2926
02:53:59,290 --> 02:54:03,190
And he'll drink and he'll smoke cigarettes
and we'll talk shit and laugh at his

2927
02:54:03,191 --> 02:54:07,540
own jokes. And everybody has like one
of the most magical experiences as a,

2928
02:54:07,541 --> 02:54:09,700
as an audience member you could ever have.

2929
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:12,550
I was young comic in New York and there
was a place called the comedy village,

2930
02:54:12,551 --> 02:54:15,160
which was the Boston. Do you
remember? I remember. Sure.

2931
02:54:15,161 --> 02:54:18,010
So it became comedy village. When did it
become the village? And it's done now,

2932
02:54:18,040 --> 02:54:21,000
but now it's like a Japanese
restaurant. A Japanese restaurant. No.

2933
02:54:22,840 --> 02:54:27,470
Got It. Jamie. Cutten. No, but, uh,
there's a, um, uh, in, in this is

2934
02:54:27,670 --> 02:54:30,040
young like bark and asking
people to come in off the street.

2935
02:54:30,790 --> 02:54:35,560
And how old were you when
you started? A 23, 23.

2936
02:54:35,710 --> 02:54:37,570
23. Yeah. And, um,

2937
02:54:38,110 --> 02:54:40,750
and Chappelle comes in
and when he gets on stage,

2938
02:54:40,751 --> 02:54:42,700
there's probably 13 people in the crowd,
right.

2939
02:54:43,210 --> 02:54:48,210
And the fucking word gets out and you
just see people start slowly graphs like

2940
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:50,140
goldfish.
You know what I mean?

2941
02:54:50,141 --> 02:54:52,480
When they could send some little
or ducks or something like that,

2942
02:54:52,481 --> 02:54:56,050
when they send some breads coming in
the pond and the place was packed within

2943
02:54:56,051 --> 02:55:00,220
like 20 minutes. Wow. Outside, it was
just everybody texting their friend.

2944
02:55:00,221 --> 02:55:04,830
Oh my God. Chappelle's here, here to
do so crazy. And he did six hours, Bro.

2945
02:55:05,080 --> 02:55:06,530
One real dude.

2946
02:55:06,531 --> 02:55:09,250
And were there were there were girls like
falling asleep or something like maybe

2947
02:55:09,260 --> 02:55:10,850
four hours, 24 hours, something like that.

2948
02:55:10,851 --> 02:55:15,380
It was one of these known ones
landed it. It was jazz. Right?

2949
02:55:15,381 --> 02:55:18,890
It wasn't like, it wasn't like I'm doing
bits and I'm murdering the whole time.

2950
02:55:19,460 --> 02:55:24,460
He has this ability to make the audience
comfortable intention so that it is not

2951
02:55:27,260 --> 02:55:29,380
anxiety inducing.
Right.

2952
02:55:29,710 --> 02:55:33,140
What what he can do is talk to you for
five minutes straight without a punchline.

2953
02:55:33,380 --> 02:55:37,070
But as an audience member, you're
not going, oh my God is this guy,

2954
02:55:37,400 --> 02:55:38,300
is this guy not funny

2955
02:55:39,490 --> 02:55:40,323
when he was,

2956
02:55:40,570 --> 02:55:44,410
he was doing that for a while and
where he wasn't doing scheduled shows,

2957
02:55:44,470 --> 02:55:47,560
all he was doing was these pop ends.
And not only that,

2958
02:55:47,561 --> 02:55:52,561
but he brought a fucking speaker and set
up a microphone in the park in Seattle,

2959
02:55:53,880 --> 02:55:58,310
outdoor, outdoor. You know he did that
early on. Yeah, I was there. I watched it,

2960
02:55:58,680 --> 02:56:00,590
watched them do it in much New York or not

2961
02:56:01,140 --> 02:56:01,951
do it in Montreal.

2962
02:56:01,951 --> 02:56:06,951
We did a set together at club soda and
as we got outside we went outside and

2963
02:56:07,290 --> 02:56:08,510
Dave just said

2964
02:56:08,570 --> 02:56:10,270
gather round,
people gather it.

2965
02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:13,040
And he started doing stand up to people
in the street and they were like,

2966
02:56:13,041 --> 02:56:17,840
what in the fuck? He was probably like
20 so do you know William Stephenson?

2967
02:56:17,960 --> 02:56:20,840
Yeah. Comic rest, some shorts and a,

2968
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:24,110
he was one of the original like comedy
and the park guys doing stand up.

2969
02:56:24,300 --> 02:56:29,300
Charlie Barnett, Barnett, Barnett
and Dave would go with those doubts.

2970
02:56:29,330 --> 02:56:30,830
Yup. Yup. And like,

2971
02:56:31,280 --> 02:56:36,250
can you imagine a more hostile environment
for stand up the New York City Park,

2972
02:56:36,290 --> 02:56:37,760
New York City Park.

2973
02:56:38,120 --> 02:56:42,800
You compete with guys doing fun flips
over Swedish tourists and then there's a

2974
02:56:42,801 --> 02:56:47,180
guy just with jokes hand hanging on is
you know, handling his own. It's like,

2975
02:56:47,181 --> 02:56:50,630
then you put him on a stage with lights
and fucking Mike and a see and some

2976
02:56:50,631 --> 02:56:54,410
cigarettes. Yep, that's,
yeah, it's trength training.

2977
02:56:54,440 --> 02:56:55,700
It's like running with weights on,

2978
02:56:55,820 --> 02:56:57,920
so how do what the question
is how do we do that?

2979
02:56:58,100 --> 02:57:03,100
Like how do you find that
the more successful you get
when you have people that

2980
02:57:03,411 --> 02:57:07,910
are coming to see you no matter what?
Where do we get our strength training?

2981
02:57:07,911 --> 02:57:09,160
Where do we get smoke weed.

2982
02:57:09,400 --> 02:57:13,250
Paranoid. That's what I'm
saying, Bro. I feel vulnerable.

2983
02:57:14,660 --> 02:57:19,330
That was going to feel scared.
Filled nervous a lot.

2984
02:57:19,390 --> 02:57:21,700
I like it. I really do. I do it all.

2985
02:57:21,870 --> 02:57:26,560
Like I joke around on stage about how
I take edibles when I go to the airport

2986
02:57:26,561 --> 02:57:29,680
because I like feeling, I want to know
what the fuck's really bothering me,

2987
02:57:30,040 --> 02:57:33,880
but it's really true. I really do do
that. I take an edible when I fly.

2988
02:57:34,060 --> 02:57:38,290
It's just like a freak out because you're
too comfortable with this. Weird, yeah.

2989
02:57:38,320 --> 02:57:40,120
I get something out of that freaking out.

2990
02:57:40,121 --> 02:57:45,121
Like I'll find out where the holes in my
game or I find out where my mental game

2991
02:57:45,341 --> 02:57:46,160
is lacking,

2992
02:57:46,160 --> 02:57:51,160
what's really bothering me and then things
that freaked me out that I don't like

2993
02:57:51,461 --> 02:57:56,300
about myself. I've work on them. I
fix them. I visit the wizard. You,

2994
02:57:56,350 --> 02:57:57,580
you got to visit the wizard.

2995
02:57:58,210 --> 02:58:03,210
I wonder if this comes from having
fighting background because the one thing

2996
02:58:03,901 --> 02:58:07,140
about fighting is if you
have a hole in your game,

2997
02:58:07,620 --> 02:58:12,090
it's exposed in the most brutal
way. Right. Everything else in life,

2998
02:58:12,270 --> 02:58:16,170
you can ignore the holes in your
game. Yup. You can just be like, oh,

2999
02:58:16,171 --> 02:58:19,470
I'm not a bad storyteller any. They were
just busy. I concentrate on my strengths.

3000
02:58:19,500 --> 02:58:22,890
Yeah. Yeah. Boxing or fight,
whatever it is. It's just like,

3001
02:58:22,950 --> 02:58:24,450
I better keep my hand up.
Yep.

3002
02:58:25,610 --> 02:58:29,870
You better patch up those holes, bitch.
Maybe that's what it is with standing on.

3003
02:58:29,990 --> 02:58:34,160
I think that's what it is with me.
I'm just, that's my formula. I mean,

3004
02:58:34,170 --> 02:58:36,110
I don't recommend it to everybody
because everybody doesn't have the same

3005
02:58:36,111 --> 02:58:40,490
personality. Like you might not
have those same deficiencies.

3006
02:58:40,491 --> 02:58:44,000
Like it actually might be psychologically
damaging to some people to get as high

3007
02:58:44,001 --> 02:58:45,980
as I get.
You know,

3008
02:58:46,010 --> 02:58:48,410
like it might fuck with your head too
much where you don't come back from it.

3009
02:58:48,411 --> 02:58:49,880
I come back like a nicer person,

3010
02:58:50,090 --> 02:58:55,090
but I'm in the same throws of fucking
agony that a lot of people are when they

3011
02:58:55,131 --> 02:58:58,170
get to high.
So you're purposely yeah.

3012
02:58:58,610 --> 02:59:02,420
Fucking your shock and my system.
Yeah.

3013
02:59:03,140 --> 02:59:05,810
A purposely freak myself the fuck out.
Yeah.

3014
02:59:07,550 --> 02:59:10,430
And you don't think you'd be able to
create without it? Oh, definitely could,

3015
02:59:10,460 --> 02:59:11,270
but not as good.

3016
02:59:11,270 --> 02:59:15,470
I don't know if I can as good, but
I know it works. I like doing it.

3017
02:59:15,800 --> 02:59:18,590
I liked doing it because uh,
I always benefit from it.

3018
02:59:18,860 --> 02:59:22,670
I feel like I come back from
those little paranoid journeys.

3019
02:59:22,940 --> 02:59:26,810
I go a little bit of a better person
and I think it's been responsible along

3020
02:59:26,811 --> 02:59:29,210
with other psychedelics
and becoming a father.

3021
02:59:29,540 --> 02:59:32,840
All those things may be a better person.
Maybe a nicer person,

3022
02:59:32,990 --> 02:59:37,160
maybe more compassionate, more
understanding, more friendly. Well, yeah.

3023
02:59:37,610 --> 02:59:42,140
More understanding is the big
one. More. More just I get it.

3024
02:59:42,200 --> 02:59:46,460
I don't want to be confident all the time.
I don't want to always be successful,

3025
02:59:46,590 --> 02:59:48,050
like,
you know what I mean?

3026
02:59:49,130 --> 02:59:52,790
This is like good people listening right
now that like that's all they want,

3027
02:59:53,300 --> 02:59:55,760
but they haven't experienced the
other side of the coin. Yeah.

3028
02:59:56,080 --> 02:59:56,691
Do you know what I'm saying?

3029
02:59:56,691 --> 03:00:00,200
But when people get too confident and
then they have an audience, right.

3030
03:00:00,200 --> 03:00:03,260
If you have an audience, that's part of
the problem is, and we've all seen this,

3031
03:00:03,261 --> 03:00:04,910
when comics become really successful,

3032
03:00:05,060 --> 03:00:08,330
they work to their own crowd
and they don't do sets. Yeah.

3033
03:00:08,420 --> 03:00:09,700
They don't do a set like I'll do it.

3034
03:00:09,720 --> 03:00:13,980
The store you'll do where there's like 10
people on the line. Right, right, right.

3035
03:00:14,910 --> 03:00:19,490
Deleah yeah. They might be
there to see a fucking Eliza.

3036
03:00:19,491 --> 03:00:21,220
They might not be there to see me at all.
Right.

3037
03:00:21,350 --> 03:00:23,460
But I want to hit those mother fuckers.

3038
03:00:23,510 --> 03:00:26,180
I want to hit them hard and they want
to go, oh, look at this meathead.

3039
03:00:26,360 --> 03:00:29,600
You know this fucking champ. Look and
dude, what's he going to say? You're like,

3040
03:00:29,601 --> 03:00:32,030
yeah, you can't be smart and
funny. You can't be interesting.

3041
03:00:32,420 --> 03:00:36,170
Whatever their biases is. I got to
figure out a way to sue that over.

3042
03:00:36,171 --> 03:00:39,800
And the best way to do that is you got
to perform and hostile environments

3043
03:00:39,801 --> 03:00:44,750
occasionally. Yeah. You know that this
is all so critical, man. So critical.

3044
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:49,020
Have good openers like up killers, kill.
Bring murderers with me on the road.

3045
03:00:49,040 --> 03:00:52,330
Only way to do it. I bring Joey d as
in the road with me, man, I brought,

3046
03:00:52,340 --> 03:00:54,020
brought Joey d as in the road for years.

3047
03:00:54,110 --> 03:00:57,140
I would tell people they would get
white in the face. They'd be like, what?

3048
03:00:57,810 --> 03:01:02,800
The who opened for you in Dallas? Oh,
Diaz did. Joey, do you get nervous?

3049
03:01:02,801 --> 03:01:05,860
Like what?
Joey Diaz in front of 6,000 people,

3050
03:01:05,861 --> 03:01:09,190
Joey Diaz Open for you and
you ain't seen murderer.

3051
03:01:09,490 --> 03:01:14,490
You Ain't seen Joey Diaz at the Chicago
theater for a 3,700 people in the

3052
03:01:15,341 --> 03:01:17,770
fucking lights are dimming the lights or

3053
03:01:19,270 --> 03:01:22,520
fucking crushing so hard.
People are falling down there.

3054
03:01:22,550 --> 03:01:26,710
They're in pain and pain. Yeah.
You've never seen him live.

3055
03:01:27,200 --> 03:01:30,810
Ooh, I really wanted to, when I was
in la, I set it up Halloween town for,

3056
03:01:30,820 --> 03:01:34,570
I got to go tomorrow. You'll even a,
yeah. Is he around tonight? I'll find out.

3057
03:01:34,900 --> 03:01:37,270
I would love to. He might be. He might
be doing a set at the store tonight.

3058
03:01:37,300 --> 03:01:41,550
I'll ask him, man. There is. He's
the goat and my opinion. Really? Yup.

3059
03:01:41,980 --> 03:01:45,070
Whoa. I never seen anybody
funnier. Whoa. He's,

3060
03:01:45,200 --> 03:01:47,890
he might not be the best writer.

3061
03:01:47,920 --> 03:01:51,760
He might not have the most
consistently crafted hours,

3062
03:01:51,970 --> 03:01:53,920
but it terms of the highest highs,

3063
03:01:54,010 --> 03:01:58,810
that motherfucker breaks through the mag
fear and he wiggles out into the outer

3064
03:01:58,811 --> 03:01:59,800
atmosphere of space.

3065
03:01:59,801 --> 03:02:04,020
Like no one he hits these
highs were like comics,

3066
03:02:04,050 --> 03:02:05,950
comics work are crying,

3067
03:02:06,160 --> 03:02:10,960
like holding your stomach crying and
he's screaming and yelling and it's like,

3068
03:02:11,170 --> 03:02:14,020
you ain't seen nothing like it,
man. He was onstage. I wrote about,

3069
03:02:14,050 --> 03:02:15,670
I put it on my Instagram the other day.

3070
03:02:15,970 --> 03:02:20,150
He crushed so hard and I can't
even say what he was talking.

3071
03:02:21,560 --> 03:02:22,393
He

3072
03:02:23,770 --> 03:02:28,770
crush is so hard and it was
such controversial material.

3073
03:02:29,181 --> 03:02:32,980
So unapologetic. Good Push. Yeah.

3074
03:02:34,090 --> 03:02:36,670
And He, at one point in time, people
were like, what the fuck? He goes,

3075
03:02:36,671 --> 03:02:39,580
what do you want from me? I'm almost
dead. Because they got to give a fuck.

3076
03:02:40,540 --> 03:02:44,710
And people were dying. I mean dying. I
don't think there's ever been a person.

3077
03:02:44,920 --> 03:02:49,450
I've seen everybody, dude, I seen
everybody from rock to Chappelle,

3078
03:02:49,451 --> 03:02:52,420
the Louis C,
k I watched Sam Kinison when he was alive.

3079
03:02:52,421 --> 03:02:55,840
I saw bill Hicks when he was
alive. I opened up, I'm a follow,

3080
03:02:55,841 --> 03:02:58,720
I had a follow up prior when he was dying,

3081
03:02:58,930 --> 03:03:02,260
when it looked for five weeks in a row,
but I saw a prior live.

3082
03:03:02,560 --> 03:03:06,520
I've seen everybody live. I saw
Martin Lawrence and he's in his prime.

3083
03:03:06,670 --> 03:03:10,330
People forget how funny Martin
Lawrence was. He was destroyed.

3084
03:03:10,360 --> 03:03:12,490
I saw him back when he was
wearing leather jumpsuits,

3085
03:03:12,850 --> 03:03:17,850
who'd gone still realize man was leather
jumpsuits and smash smash and the

3086
03:03:18,421 --> 03:03:22,060
struggle on after him.
But I never saw anybody like Joey.

3087
03:03:22,510 --> 03:03:25,600
Joey's on another level. Who
is, who's your toughest follow

3088
03:03:27,220 --> 03:03:31,990
Joey? Without a doubt. Yeah, man.
You gotta. You gotta ride that wave.

3089
03:03:32,410 --> 03:03:34,340
But that's what's good
about it is like if you're,

3090
03:03:34,400 --> 03:03:39,340
if you're funny and you're working on your
stuff and you're and you enjoy comedy,

3091
03:03:39,520 --> 03:03:42,040
you go on stage already laughing,

3092
03:03:42,490 --> 03:03:46,360
so you go on stage already in a
good mood. That's, that's what's up.

3093
03:03:46,361 --> 03:03:49,840
Like part of the being a tough,
tough follow is two things. One,

3094
03:03:50,080 --> 03:03:54,070
you're used to going on after scrubs
and there's a lot of guys that are good

3095
03:03:54,071 --> 03:03:54,790
comics,

3096
03:03:54,790 --> 03:03:58,160
but they'd like to bring scrubs in the
road with them and then they get settled

3097
03:03:58,160 --> 03:04:02,110
in in that easy sort of, I'm
going to see the show. Exactly.

3098
03:04:02,510 --> 03:04:05,120
There's a lot of guys that do that, man.
They'll take guys on the road with them.

3099
03:04:05,300 --> 03:04:09,350
They're really or barely professionals
and these guys are filling theaters and

3100
03:04:09,351 --> 03:04:14,351
they're bringing week acts and they forced
us audience to sit through a half an

3101
03:04:14,750 --> 03:04:19,750
hour of bullshit before they go onstage
and then there's guys who don't do it

3102
03:04:20,151 --> 03:04:23,030
like that. They just look, I don't know.

3103
03:04:23,240 --> 03:04:27,050
I don't know who was doing it
that way before I was doing it,

3104
03:04:27,350 --> 03:04:32,180
but my thought was I like, if a guy
makes me nervous when I go on after him,

3105
03:04:32,181 --> 03:04:36,290
that's going to make me ramp it up like
I don't, I don't walk on stage cold.

3106
03:04:36,470 --> 03:04:40,430
I'm backstage throwing punches
and doing jumping jacks.

3107
03:04:40,431 --> 03:04:42,200
I'm doing breathing exercises.

3108
03:04:42,590 --> 03:04:47,590
When I come on stage I'm fucking guns
blazing and that that's if you go on after

3109
03:04:48,051 --> 03:04:51,530
Joey Diaz when he hits that crescendo,
it better be ready.

3110
03:04:52,370 --> 03:04:53,510
When you came into the store,

3111
03:04:53,780 --> 03:04:56,660
I remember I was about to
ask you something and you
were on the wall and then

3112
03:04:56,661 --> 03:05:00,110
you just folded in half and
touch your toes and I was like,

3113
03:05:00,111 --> 03:05:04,610
what the fuck is going? I could barely
touch my ankles was like, all right,

3114
03:05:04,611 --> 03:05:08,480
this is ritual. I'm going to let
him do his thing. Listen Up. Yeah.

3115
03:05:08,510 --> 03:05:13,510
I get loose and I figured out that over
the over time you can just walk on stage

3116
03:05:13,911 --> 03:05:17,990
and everything would be fine or you walk
on stage with a already you've got some

3117
03:05:17,991 --> 03:05:19,250
intention.
Yeah.

3118
03:05:19,720 --> 03:05:22,610
I guess sometimes I got to remind myself
of certain things to get up there.

3119
03:05:22,780 --> 03:05:26,900
And the most important thing I learned
is reminding myself that this crowd

3120
03:05:26,901 --> 03:05:28,850
wasn't at the last show.
Yeah.

3121
03:05:28,970 --> 03:05:31,970
Like you sometimes you can
take that energy from the
early show and we were just

3122
03:05:31,971 --> 03:05:35,180
bottling it and you're like, oh, I
got this. Let's go, let's just walk.

3123
03:05:35,660 --> 03:05:39,660
They weren't there, so you can't
do that. Can't do that. Yeah.

3124
03:05:39,910 --> 03:05:44,510
You gotta you gotta always, always
appreciate the audience's attention span.

3125
03:05:44,540 --> 03:05:48,590
And that's something that I've really
learned from Boston and Boston.

3126
03:05:48,620 --> 03:05:49,970
It's cold as fuck.

3127
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:53,690
The women aren't the prettiest in the
world and people are angry and they got to

3128
03:05:53,691 --> 03:05:57,800
work in the morning.
I'd be ready Tuesday night I did this,

3129
03:05:57,830 --> 03:05:59,810
I did this thing and
it never got picked up.

3130
03:05:59,811 --> 03:06:02,480
And I put it out as part of
this like a series. Essentially.

3131
03:06:02,481 --> 03:06:04,580
It's like I emulated Bourdain's thing.

3132
03:06:04,581 --> 03:06:07,850
I want to look at a city through the lens
of comedy instead of food. Right. And I,

3133
03:06:07,940 --> 03:06:10,640
the first city I picked was Boston, cause
all my favorite comics are from Boston.

3134
03:06:10,910 --> 03:06:15,770
And I'm like, why the fuck has
this city produced so much funny?

3135
03:06:15,800 --> 03:06:19,970
What does much immigrant people, is
that it? Yeah, so it landed there.

3136
03:06:19,971 --> 03:06:23,000
And what type of funny Patrice
O'neal's Michael, right? Yup.

3137
03:06:23,030 --> 03:06:25,910
So it's like put Patrice,
but he's one of the goats for sure.

3138
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:29,940
You can go bill Murray one liners
Berg late, whatever. Steven,

3139
03:06:30,940 --> 03:06:34,610
Steven Wright.
Conan is from the area.

3140
03:06:34,670 --> 03:06:37,280
I think we're talking about
all different types of comedy.

3141
03:06:38,120 --> 03:06:40,220
Silvermans I think from New Hampshire
or something like that. Right.

3142
03:06:40,221 --> 03:06:45,221
But like there's something about the
region that no matter what style you see,

3143
03:06:46,340 --> 03:06:50,910
you funny come from here where
you're from. An area of what?

3144
03:06:50,911 --> 03:06:54,470
What was it? Newton. Newton.
Boston. You're actually, yeah,

3145
03:06:54,471 --> 03:06:56,010
so I was talking to in Boston.
I knew you started

3146
03:06:56,010 --> 03:06:58,410
there, but I didn't know if
you were from the city or what.

3147
03:06:58,460 --> 03:07:00,540
He was born in New Jersey,
but a,

3148
03:07:00,541 --> 03:07:03,600
I lived all throughout my high school
years and everything. I lived in Boston,

3149
03:07:03,630 --> 03:07:07,500
so it's like what the, what
the fuck is it about? This city

3150
03:07:10,010 --> 03:07:14,390
was cold as fuck. It's cold.
Yeah, but something there.

3151
03:07:14,480 --> 03:07:18,240
It's too cold. I need to be warming
up to like talk to people. Yeah.

3152
03:07:19,170 --> 03:07:21,350
It needs to be warm enough
for we go outside also,

3153
03:07:21,860 --> 03:07:26,630
well you know it's a scene. It's like
a scene has to be established to,

3154
03:07:26,631 --> 03:07:29,550
because Boston does not have the scene
it used to have in the 80s right.

3155
03:07:29,660 --> 03:07:33,890
But la has a better scene than ever and
scenes are fluid. They come and they go,

3156
03:07:34,100 --> 03:07:37,490
you know like Denver has a scene and they
have a scene because of Wendy who owns

3157
03:07:37,491 --> 03:07:39,590
the comic con.
But there's,

3158
03:07:39,680 --> 03:07:44,510
there's different places that have scenes
and Barry Crimmins and Lenny Clarke

3159
03:07:44,540 --> 03:07:48,590
and Steve Sweeney and dawn Gavin and all
those guys that were part of the Ding

3160
03:07:48,590 --> 03:07:51,080
Ho in the 1980s and
Steve was on my podcast.

3161
03:07:51,240 --> 03:07:55,490
And those guys created a
scene and through that scene,

3162
03:07:55,580 --> 03:07:56,301
the end,

3163
03:07:56,301 --> 03:07:59,300
because they were all competing with
each other for spots on the tonight show

3164
03:07:59,301 --> 03:08:02,680
and all these different little
venues, they, they created a,

3165
03:08:02,740 --> 03:08:07,520
a monster dynamic where all these young
guys were coming up following these

3166
03:08:07,521 --> 03:08:10,610
killers. And I was very fortunate
to be one of those guys.

3167
03:08:10,611 --> 03:08:14,840
And that's why I wanted to talk to Steve
and tell him that on the show is like I

3168
03:08:14,841 --> 03:08:16,520
saw that fucking guy,

3169
03:08:16,790 --> 03:08:20,360
I saw that guy murder
murder to the Pullman. No,

3170
03:08:20,361 --> 03:08:23,630
and nobody was watching in terms
of like the national audience,

3171
03:08:23,720 --> 03:08:24,770
it was just Boston,

3172
03:08:25,130 --> 03:08:29,570
but he would go on stage at Nick's comedy
stop and level the crowd level that

3173
03:08:29,571 --> 03:08:33,800
like a fucking hydrogen bomb dropped
in the middle of the room. Just boom.

3174
03:08:33,870 --> 03:08:36,450
So you,
so you learn what killing is like.

3175
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:39,690
I feel like one of the toughest
things about the alternative scenes,

3176
03:08:39,691 --> 03:08:41,310
and I'm not knocking this,
they're the comedy,

3177
03:08:41,311 --> 03:08:45,540
but the litmus test for
murdering is different. You know,

3178
03:08:45,750 --> 03:08:50,190
when I was coming up in New York and I
had to follow recipes, Mike Destefano,

3179
03:08:50,420 --> 03:08:53,960
you know, Greer Barnes guys that
maybe are not household names but

3180
03:08:54,240 --> 03:08:58,650
did Greer's a beast.
Greer and I did shows together.

3181
03:08:58,651 --> 03:09:02,610
We did it colleges together right
back on the road. Wave in the 90s.

3182
03:09:03,060 --> 03:09:06,920
If, um, if you want to know, at least for
me, if you want to know what Chappelle is,

3183
03:09:07,130 --> 03:09:11,630
Chappelle is Tony Woods and Greer,
he is a,

3184
03:09:11,900 --> 03:09:14,720
Tony was another beast,
but Tony is unfathomable.

3185
03:09:14,721 --> 03:09:17,300
But like he's the Gremlin that
popped off of both of their backs.

3186
03:09:17,301 --> 03:09:19,070
Like if you could mold them together,

3187
03:09:19,640 --> 03:09:23,000
like everything that is amazing
about Tony and amazing about Greer.

3188
03:09:23,190 --> 03:09:26,340
Well, I mean, that's how it is with
music. That's how it is with everything.

3189
03:09:26,341 --> 03:09:27,870
We need each other.
You know?

3190
03:09:27,871 --> 03:09:32,580
That's why when I see a guy
like you coming up and I'm
like, Ooh, good. Thank you.

3191
03:09:32,640 --> 03:09:35,880
I'm happy you're around. Um,
I like it. I like comedy.

3192
03:09:35,970 --> 03:09:40,350
If I stopped doing comedy tomorrow,
I want more comedy to watch.

3193
03:09:40,410 --> 03:09:44,100
I love La. I love laughing. Yeah. I
like, that's why I tell you I've sit,

3194
03:09:44,101 --> 03:09:48,720
I sit down and watch Joey Diaz. I
fucking love Comma here, you know?

3195
03:09:48,750 --> 03:09:53,010
And but thinking about Joey is, Joey
has new material all the fucking time.

3196
03:09:53,260 --> 03:09:54,070
You go see Joey

3197
03:09:54,070 --> 03:09:57,340
now and you see him four months from
now, you'll see a whole new set. Yeah.

3198
03:09:57,341 --> 03:10:00,570
I got to see Joey while I'm out here.
He's the best man. I'm telling you.

3199
03:10:00,580 --> 03:10:03,940
If he's doing his watch him, I'm going
to try to see if he's where's? Yeah.

3200
03:10:03,970 --> 03:10:05,980
You guys have a show? I
think so. Maybe I'll go.

3201
03:10:06,040 --> 03:10:09,550
Maybe I'll run over and see comedy
store. What time? Eight o'clock show. Oh,

3202
03:10:09,551 --> 03:10:12,010
he's on the eight o'clock show. Yeah.
Well, have you got the eight o'clock show?

3203
03:10:12,960 --> 03:10:15,160
It'd be on later. I'll find
out when he's up. Yeah.

3204
03:10:15,370 --> 03:10:17,080
Who shows tonight at the comedy store

3205
03:10:18,370 --> 03:10:21,100

of the scholars or show?

3206
03:10:21,460 --> 03:10:25,120
Oh my on that tonight at
10 o'clock I think I am.

3207
03:10:26,430 --> 03:10:31,120
That's what it said. Okay. Oh
yeah. I guess I am. All right.

3208
03:10:31,600 --> 03:10:35,090
I forgot. Well, I know I have a set
of the store. I guess I have to,

3209
03:10:37,820 --> 03:10:42,320

this up. Andrew. Thank you. Here we go.
