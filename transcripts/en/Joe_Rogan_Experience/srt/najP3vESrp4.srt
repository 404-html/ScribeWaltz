1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,880
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,970
They have to film it by 2018
you think Bert was still be fat?

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,100
100% absolutely.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,540
You really committed to this.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,291
Of course,

6
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:10,561
man.

7
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:11,820
He's a guy with feelings.

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,470
I know and I love him.

9
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,760
He's one of my best friends.

10
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,140
I would do anything for that guy.

11
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,600
If you can get inside
his head and change him.

12
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,350
Yeah.

13
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,880
Would you stop get them to stop drinking?

14
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,073
No.

15
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,670
What about after January
3rd definitely not.

16
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,180
No.

17
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,110
I want them to be happy.

18
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,030
The only way he'll be happy
as if he keeps drinking.

19
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:30,840
Absolutely.

20
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,690
Maybe with new technology,

21
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,120
they'll figure out a way
to fix your liver maybe,

22
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,390
but we'll have like a stem cell liver
cleanse and I'll just pump that shit in

23
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:40,980
there and way,

24
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,990
way into the bird is thin future.

25
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,560
Maybe I'll do something like that and
maybe Burt will have to drink more because

26
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,130
his liver will be so good
that the booze won't last.

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,351
Right.

28
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,800
So we're up in like 20 minutes
fucking partying harder.

29
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,240
He's a fun guy to party with.

30
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,223
Oh yes.

31
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,210
Have you ever seen him do
stand out with a shirt on?

32
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,373
Yes.

33
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,330
Back in the good times.

34
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,090
Um,

35
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,470
I saw him for a while doing it.

36
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:01,740
He used,

37
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,573
he used to do it.

38
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,440
He only started doing that,

39
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:06,630
I feel like about two years ago,

40
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:07,351
maybe three.

41
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:07,880
I feel like it's,

42
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,780
it's fairly recent in the time that I've
known him and seen him to stand up and

43
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,020
I'm,

44
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,160
and I think it was since then.

45
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:15,810
Have you ever seen him do
stand up with a shirt on?

46
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,440
No,

47
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,010
I haven't either.

48
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,720
Yeah,

49
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:17,920
it's,

50
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,220
it's,

51
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:18,451
it's,

52
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:18,900
um,

53
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,531
but it works.

54
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:21,120
It's almost like part of the persona,

55
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,983
you know?

56
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,261
Well,

57
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:22,710
it's like,

58
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,360
I forget when he didn't used to.

59
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,343
Dude.

60
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,030
Is he bigger than you or is it just me?

61
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:31,651
Not Man.

62
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:31,861
No,

63
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:32,694
we're about the same.

64
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,960
About the same size.

65
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,220
How does his pants stay right
above his dick like that?

66
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:39,270
That seems impossible.

67
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,930
It seems like there's a belt,

68
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,840
this belt right there.

69
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,231
Yeah.

70
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:43,560
But that,

71
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,350
that's different photo Moshe
Kasher showing his goods.

72
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,300
Tighty whities Moshe is a funny guy too,

73
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:48,511
man.

74
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:49,670
He's got a new show coming out on top.

75
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,700
On comedy central.

76
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,001
Yeah.

77
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:51,231
That's,

78
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:51,660
um,

79
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,040
it's a really cool idea.

80
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,650
I'm sure it will be back
to talk to very smart dude.

81
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,490
Yeah.

82
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:56,791
Very,

83
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,181
very smart.

84
00:01:57,181 --> 00:02:01,460
Was that Brian Couch on his abs with Bert
Kreischer that right below that is the

85
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,050
MDF,

86
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,883
I would say to gift.

87
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,480
See,

88
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,710
I'm so sorry Brian.

89
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,720
But when that's a little tiny image,

90
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:07,910
it does look like Brian Keaulana.

91
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,230
Tell me,

92
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,420
does it damn look at Eddie,

93
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,360
Eddie shredded Dah,

94
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:10,501
Dah,

95
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:10,681
Dah,

96
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:10,851
Dah,

97
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:11,540
Dah.

98
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,720
So it was bird looks good there.

99
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,440
No,

100
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,273
that's not true at all.

101
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,263
Um,

102
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,520
Eddie is a crossfit shit.

103
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,001
Oh,

104
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,140
is he loves crossfit.

105
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,090
It's just got that bloated
distended thing though.

106
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,960
Well that's booze.

107
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,561
That's what I'm saying.

108
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:23,010
That's it.

109
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,180
There's no way he can get out of that.

110
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,380
I think he could.

111
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,161
What's he down to now?

112
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:26,790
Was he claiming?

113
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,300
I don't know,

114
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,350
cause he hasn't claimed in a minute.

115
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,040
Oh,

116
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,900
well here's a photo that
he keeps bringing it up.

117
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,900
Have him back when he was real
thin when he was real young,

118
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:34,561
like in college.

119
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:35,490
That's hilarious.

120
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:36,241
He's bringing that one out.

121
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,440
But getting back to that bro,

122
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,770
they were talking about um,

123
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,030
what's going on in the Ohio river that um,

124
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,600
they're,

125
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,040
they're putting these catfish in lakes
and they're taking them out of rivers are

126
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,620
putting large cat fish in
lakes but they can't survive.

127
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,540
They can only live in
these lakes for so long.

128
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,730
But everybody wants to
catch a big catfish.

129
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,140
So they have these commercial cat
fishing businesses where recreational

130
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,440
catfishing where they'll take these
people and they'll have them fishing and

131
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:06,441
these lakes and the use some sort of
chemical in the lake that forces the cat

132
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:08,860
fish to bite.

133
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,211
Yeah.

134
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:10,601
And this,

135
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,560
this chemical fish bordello yeah,

136
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:13,660
it's really gross man.

137
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,260
Cause the causes these legions
on the catfish is skin.

138
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,610
So these people catch these catfishes
and they have cat fish rather sorry.

139
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,520
And they have these red sores all over
their body because some chemicals have

140
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,970
been introduced into the water,

141
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:32,260
which I guess the irritant causes
them to like they're biting out of

142
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:32,951
frustration.

143
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:36,160
I guess maybe the unspeakable
and pursuit of the inedible.

144
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,870
What's is so bizarre,

145
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,960
like what a strange choice
that people have decided.

146
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,610
Let's take this animal out there.

147
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:44,170
There's one with legions on it.

148
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,640
Oh yeah,

149
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,620
yeah.

150
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,411
We'll see.

151
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:47,980
Another issue.

152
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,590
Rides on bigger calf fishes
are introduced into pay lakes.

153
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,370
Yeah.

154
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,120
So legs.

155
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,480
Yeah,

156
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,590
they have these lakes.

157
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,880
So I didn't even know that.

158
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,080
I didn't even know there was a paleo.

159
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,260
Like look at the all
the spots on that one.

160
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,940
Look at the fucking spot on that day.

161
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,143
And I'm,

162
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,430
you find what it says that chemical
is that they dumped into the water.

163
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,470
Just go to the Rappahannock
river in Virginia.

164
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:09,304
You'll catch a nice one.

165
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,750
I've got 70 pounders.

166
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,973
Well

167
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,751
in a river.

168
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:14,584
Really?

169
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,071
Yeah.

170
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,120
I mean how many of them are out?

171
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,361
Which,

172
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:18,160
which fish you catch is a blue.

173
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:18,990
That's a white fish.

174
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,570
A white cat.

175
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,111
A white cat.

176
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,230
Cause it's a big one by cats.

177
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,270
Bluecat's channel cats.

178
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:22,631
But yeah,

179
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:24,040
blues and whites are usually the biggest.

180
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,620
Did you apply?

181
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,720
Heads get really big too,

182
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:26,650
but they don't live in Virginia.

183
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,870
I don't think it's called juicing.

184
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,991
Okay.

185
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:33,550
The chemicals they put in the water make
the fish bite in the pay lake industry.

186
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:34,540
It's called juicing.

187
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,590
Well weird.

188
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,450
Look at the fucking lesions on that thing.

189
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:38,350
Scroll up a little Jamie,

190
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,040
back up.

191
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,380
Look at the poor things body.

192
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,983
It's just wrong.

193
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,080
It's bizarre.

194
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,070
It's not just wrong.

195
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,940
It's bizarre.

196
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,411
I tell you,

197
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,140
I don't really understand how that ever
got past people who are like accepting

198
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:50,560
that.

199
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,730
Like that's a natural one.

200
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,140
The one below that.

201
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:56,140
This seems totally healthy that
some got caught from a river.

202
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,600
So these pay lakes is a,

203
00:04:58,601 --> 00:04:59,021
it's like a,

204
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,820
I guess it's like a private land thing.

205
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:04,390
So many owns and it just keeps dumping
these fish in there and apparently they

206
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:05,500
don't live there very long.

207
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,320
They all else a fishing equivalent of a,

208
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:08,801
of a,

209
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:11,290
those little teeny high fence
places you see in the east.

210
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,410
Go Hunt,

211
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,990
go hunt elk on 40 acres.

212
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,180
How hard was it for you to get sober?

213
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,673
Uh,

214
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,410
fear was a big motivator in that for me.

215
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,603
You know,

216
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,610
losing my family was,

217
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,660
that was,

218
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,820
that was the thing that scared me so much.

219
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:30,571
That was the bottom.

220
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:35,370
I hit that my family's going to go away
because of my behaviors that I brought

221
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:36,450
home from the road.

222
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,600
I got kicked out of the house by my wife.

223
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:41,790
I was living on my own somewhere in,

224
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,030
uh,

225
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,863
you know,

226
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,460
I did not want that.

227
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,130
And maybe as part of my upbringing,

228
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,921
you know,

229
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:48,480
uh,

230
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,970
my family kind of
disintegrated when I was a kid,

231
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:51,390
you know,

232
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,223
father left,

233
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,340
my mother passed away.

234
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,620
I live with my brother and then
Kinda just all like family,

235
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:57,891
you know,

236
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,970
where'd my stuff go?

237
00:05:58,971 --> 00:05:59,241
Where,

238
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:03,680
where it just kind of floated away
and I do not want that happening,

239
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,430
you know,

240
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,660
no matter what's going on,

241
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:07,580
we're going to talk this
stuff out and make it work,

242
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,330
you know?

243
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,650
And my wife's of the same,

244
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,190
uh,

245
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,150
same idea,

246
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,170
same thought that,

247
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,370
you know,

248
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:13,671
her,

249
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:14,391
her family,

250
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,830
she was the invisible kid too,

251
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,820
you know,

252
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,140
so we relate a lot,

253
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:22,310
so there's no way we're going to let
you know any argument getting the way or

254
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:23,144
just,

255
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:23,870
you know,

256
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,860
we're survivors,

257
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,390
we're survivors and we're gonna,

258
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,610
we're gonna talk through
it no matter how much.

259
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,601
And you know,

260
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:30,230
she,

261
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,310
she did the right thing.

262
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,630
She kicked my ass,

263
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:33,830
right the hell out of the house,

264
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,693
you know,

265
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,640
and um,

266
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,630
that scared the shit out of me.

267
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,800
So,

268
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,281
and she said,

269
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:40,730
hey,

270
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,120
you're not just going to the therapist
now you're talking about this.

271
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,490
You got to go somewhere
and sort this shit out.

272
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,230
So that's what I did.

273
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,610
So Rehab did,

274
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,590
Rehab really worked for me,

275
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,671
telling you,

276
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,070
you to go for a while.

277
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:56,690
What worked for me was,

278
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:57,524
uh,

279
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,050
seven weeks,

280
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,080
someplace like basically
tearing you down to bones,

281
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,930
ripping your life apart.

282
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,660
Anything you thought about
yourself or what it was,

283
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,760
anything you thought you had,

284
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,541
your family,

285
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,500
your career,

286
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:15,651
your,

287
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:19,070
anything gone strip you down to just,

288
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,210
okay,

289
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,043
you're born,

290
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,120
here's how you were when you were born.

291
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:23,930
You were okay,

292
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,620
you're a good,

293
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,453
good person.

294
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,530
Let's get back to that again.

295
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,990
And then they slowly rebuild you.

296
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,630
And then I went to a,

297
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,300
uh,

298
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,960
another,

299
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,370
they call them aftercare places.

300
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,263
I went there,

301
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:35,990
uh,

302
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,970
to a couple of different ones and they
fined tuned stuff and get integrated back

303
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:41,571
into life.

304
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:43,550
Because when you were in
this cocoon and you're,

305
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,930
you're frigging raw.

306
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,201
I mean,

307
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:49,040
I was raw meat when I came out and you
can see it in that some kind of monster

308
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:49,790
movie.

309
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,200
I was pretty raw still.

310
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,160
I didn't know what I could or
what I should or shouldn't do,

311
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,083
you know.

312
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,283
Um,

313
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,460
so the,

314
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,000
the last place we went to was a
place that helps relationships.

315
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,190
So they got me and my wife
together and we'd see,

316
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:08,990
see people separately and then come
together and talk about what we did and

317
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,970
communication frigging
saved my life saved,

318
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,400
uh,

319
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,233
our family,

320
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,280
um,

321
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,450
and working through that stuff.

322
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:20,570
So very grateful for my wife.

323
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,270
She's the one that
didn't ask for this shit.

324
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,780
She walked through fire with me and
we walked out together stronger,

325
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,150
way stronger than we ever
would have been before.

326
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,291
And you know,

327
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,550
my kids know my story.

328
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:37,160
My kids know my struggles and

329
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,070
they respect that.

330
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,170
They respect me and a different way.

331
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,790
I don't have to tell them what to
do all the time or just be like,

332
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:47,624
I'm this,

333
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,610
I can say sorry.

334
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,720
I can tell them,

335
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:50,991
hey,

336
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:52,460
here's what happened when I did that.

337
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:53,490
And you know,

338
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,980
I don't need to preach to them.

339
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,040
They got their own stuff,

340
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,330
but now they,

341
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,560
now they goof with me.

342
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:03,561
I ruined my trust with my family and now
by some miracle they are goofing with

343
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:06,151
me.

344
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:06,720
He's like,

345
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,141
Dad,

346
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:07,831
shut up.

347
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,541
What do you get them like,

348
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,340
come on.

349
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,360
You know your overblowing
this your way out of dad.

350
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:14,250
You're taken up way too much space here.

351
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,143
Okay.

352
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,880
So they helped me and I realized
that there is help in a loving way.

353
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,690
[inaudible].
