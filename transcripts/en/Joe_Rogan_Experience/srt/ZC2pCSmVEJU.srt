1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
A record start broadcast

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,970
live.
Are We on the Air Gentlemen?

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,420
I'm trying to figure out how we're on 
the map because I'm looking.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,450
Here we go.
Pitches a what is this week?

5
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:18,560
Ten or some shit.
How many weeks are we doing this?

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,110
That's loving here.
I left.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,650
It's so funny because after going 
through all the old podcast,

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,470
every beginning of every single podcast,
I'm like,

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,820
you know that Tony into art bell,

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,230
please turn off your radio.
Right?

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,990
And A to.
There was people always call up that 

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:40,990
feedback himself.
Well,

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,990
they're listening to themselves and then
they're at.

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,250
So it's like a nonsense conversation.
I don't even know what they want to hear

15
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:46,990
themselves on the radio,

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,520
so like just being in the moment,
record it with my cell phone,

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,720
turn up that radio.

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,990
Fortunately this is very different,
but yeah,

19
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:00,000
I guess we want to hear ourselves 
broadcast.

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,720
So we got to show this weekend at the 
Tempe Improv almost sold out,

21
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:06,210
so Saturday night sold out already 
zoning.

22
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,270
A few tickets left for the late show.
Friday night is on its way and once we 

23
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,460
get in and to trust.
So if you want to come in,

24
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,590
you want to see the show boss type is 
always fun because our fears and Dead 

25
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:24,801
Punch and they and they let us drink now
to dead punches a pool time that I 

26
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:26,640
remember.
It took me a second dead stroke.

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,270
That's a hangar pool terminology.
Do you guys keep doing this to each 

28
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,710
other now?
It just started by itself under the,

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,170
on both theaters.
You know,

30
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,520
a new computer.
I got it on both things.

31
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:43,521
I got it on this ustream window too.
And Brian is redoing my website and in 

32
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:46,590
doing so,
just fucking master genius self.

33
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:50,580
He's put the uh,
the ustream actually on Joe Rogan.net.

34
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:53,010
So if you'd go to the webpage,
there's a,

35
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,770
there's a little corner link that says 
live Webcam,

36
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:58,410
so you can see it right from there.
It's gonna get better.

37
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,990
It's going to get back.
And it's on itunes now too.

38
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,800
And you can find the official Joe Rogan 
podcast on,

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,770
or is it just the Joe Rogan?

40
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,000
It's called the Joe Rogan podcast on 
itunes.

41
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,670
So you can get that shit or if you have 
zoom,

42
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,240
you could go to your website and 
download the MP three.

43
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,350
Yeah.
If you're one of those soon dudes who 

44
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,180
just hates apple so much.
You had to get one of the goofiest 

45
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,420
fucking devices ever.
Unless it does anything better.

46
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,450
There's no need for another one soon.
The Microsoft version of the ipod and 

47
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:31,461
the people that are that prefer it,
but it's how they're like super windows 

48
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:32,160
heads.
People that just love it

49
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,810
because no denial.
Specialty old zoom.

50
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:39,811
Do you remember ever using that where 
it's like a fake spin wheels that get 

51
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,740
pushed it down and it clicked up and now
it was retarded.

52
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,910
So new one's not bad.
I guess they probably couldn't use the 

53
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:46,910
technology.
Right?

54
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,491
Didn't you say that apple is assuming 
that people for the technology that in 

55
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,630
their iphone or android devices and 
sprint devices,

56
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:57,631
they're all fucked right now because 
they own or apple owns like 20 of the 

57
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:59,080
patents that all these new cell phones 
are using.

58
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,500
Why you have a phone like that?
That the android or the droid.

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,060
Wow.
It has pinch to zoom,

60
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:05,260
just like the iphone.
Well,

61
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:06,310
yeah,
they all,

62
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,330
apple owns all these patents.
So android might be hurting a android,

63
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,360
even palm.
It might be hurting because their new 

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,090
phones are all really just pretty much 
stealing of apples a shit.

65
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,390
Wow.
That would be nuts.

66
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,000
The only one that's not in trouble right
now.

67
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:21,920
I guess it's the new windows.
Seven phones.

68
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:25,110
So they don't use the pendants.
They haven't,

69
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,580
they,
they,

70
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,190
they were really smart not to use any 
patents.

71
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:31,570
They have their own shitload of patents.
So the problem is pinch to zoom.

72
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,320
There's no better way to do.
There really isn't.

73
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,090
No,
there has.

74
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm sure there could be like a way that 
you can make like circled as Uhm,

75
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,450
you know,
and it's squared.

76
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,880
It came circled.
C'Mon man.

77
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,400
You want,
you want to be able to pinch it.

78
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,820
Yeah.
But what if you wanted to zoom on in 

79
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:48,820
part?
Just put a circle around

80
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,980
zoom now.
No,

81
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,700
no,
no.

82
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:51,420
I want to do this.

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,440
Yeah.
But if I took five years ago,

84
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:53,870
I was like,
no,

85
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:54,520
you can go like this.

86
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,800
I know that I can do that.
It's like when you have water in your 

87
00:03:59,800 --> 00:03:59,800
ear and the water gets out of here and 
you're like,

88
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,350
oh,
now I can hear like you accepted the way

89
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:03,720
your ear was bursting when the water was
in there,

90
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,890
just like,
I'm okay with it.

91
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
I can deal with those people that still 
aren't on the Internet.

92
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,870
Like I'll just pick two males pie.
There's a fucking awesome documentary on

93
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:15,120
PBS TV about this dude who lives in the 
Arctic,

94
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,030
one of the last people that it's allowed
to live in the Arctic,

95
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:22,410
and he lives like way the fuck up in the
northeast part of Alaska.

96
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,500
Like there's no one within like hundreds
of miles.

97
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,120
Him,
he doesn't have a car.

98
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,360
He gets electricity from a generator and
he fucking shoots all his own meat,

99
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,540
kills all his own rabbits.
Kills on Caribou,

100
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,480
has to protect his cabin.

101
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,490
Little tiny ass cabinet,
like the size of a bedroom has to 

102
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,570
protect his cabin from wolves.
Like it's fun going from a bear's rather

103
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,630
bears come to the cabin because he hangs
his meat outside because it's never 

104
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:50,630
cold.
They don't have a refrigerator,

105
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,180
they don't have anything.
So he hangs his fucking meet outside and

106
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,490
bears occasionally will come into the 
campus smelling.

107
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,570
So he's got this dog that he leaves out 
that's supposed to protect and bark.

108
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,600
So then he comes out as to chase the 
bear down on the fucking shotgun and 

109
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,081
he's doing this in the nighttime.
It's night and he can't see and he's 

110
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:09,750
chasing down this fucking bear and 
shooting at it.

111
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,580
It is nuts.
Like this guy is living in the extreme.

112
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,210
I mean as as close.
I mean that's sort of civilized 

113
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,320
civilization I guess.
Yeah.

114
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,980
He's got a television,
he's got a generator.

115
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,980
He can get electricity,
watches dvds that he gets shipped to 

116
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,430
him.
He still has not seen a even an image of

117
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:34,680
the nine slash 11 towers falling.
Really know.

118
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,410
We heard about it on the radio.
Thought it was crazy.

119
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,810
But he lives up there.
Just him and his fucking wife.

120
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:41,200
Man.
It's a lot.

121
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,240
His wife,
she's not Russell Peters and Waterman's 

122
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,240
right now.
Russell Peters has bill.

123
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,680
Russell Peters is the man.
He's one of the nicest guys ever.

124
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Hi,
is this Russell who's and you have to 

125
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:54,800
deal with it.
You can't just let it go.

126
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,540
It's there.
We're all thinking about it.

127
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,270
No,

128
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,760
he's faking that lives.
The other day Russell was hanging out 

129
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:04,760
with somebody cool.
Like I forget the,

130
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,650
the old hip hop rap guy from the 
eighties as it takes to Bismarck,

131
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,940
eeg know something like that.
I was hanging out with him the other day

132
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:17,941
and was Dj quick,
easy.

133
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,620
Roscoe.
I forget,

134
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:20,370
but I was like,
man,

135
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:25,371
that's so awesome.
Someone who knows what is the answer to 

136
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:25,371
that question,
ladies and gentlemen,

137
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:30,320
you know that just about does it in a 
song.

138
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,870
The maybe it wasn't rocket.
Now I'm screwed because I don't know.

139
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,420
That doesn't fucking savage.
It wasn't the right guy.

140
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,730
Now it doesn't matter who cared.
I were just talking about how rough you 

141
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:44,730
remember.
Third base.

142
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:44,730
That'll wrap.
Third,

143
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,200
third base.
The white guy.

144
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:48,280
What happened to those guys?
I love them.

145
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,030
I do albums.
Two albums.

146
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,230
It was the DJ.
What the fuck is his name?

147
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,090
The white dude was good.
Prime Minister Pete.

148
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:00,140
Nice.
That was nice.

149
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,870
And was the other one.

150
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,700
And um,

151
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,690
I don't know what was his name?
Dj googler.

152
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,920
No,
I haven't had repeat.

153
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,700
Nice and

154
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,030
fuck.

155
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,820
Come on in folks.
Ron Bass,

156
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,050
rob base I think.
No,

157
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,490
no,
no,

158
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:19,420
no.
Basis.

159
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:20,440
The other dude.
Yes.

160
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,090
This is

161
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,450
and now I'm just confused where one had 
an MTV show.

162
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,180
Which one had the MTV show?
That's a good question.

163
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,350
Would that be nice?
Was that.

164
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,940
I know that was the next white rapper.
Rapper just wrote Dj boom,

165
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:38,570
boom.
You're just making shit up the DJ booth,

166
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,840
but I'll know the answer when I hear it.
Man.

167
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,430
Dj sniffle w who are the.
The third base is the band and there was

168
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:53,621
the white guy with glasses.
They were both white guy but the big 

169
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:53,621
guy.
Right?

170
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:53,621
Prime Minister.
Pretty Nice.

171
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,220
And so and so.
What was it?

172
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,150
Anyway,
the other guy.

173
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:58,560
Who the fuck is it?
It's not Dj Eez rock you fuck.

174
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,690
No.
Richie rich.

175
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:00,710
No Mc search.

176
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,240
Isn't that amazing how your brain just 
below up like immediately was it said,

177
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,410
why is it so hard?
I don't know.

178
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,630
Gum Inflammation.
It's like,

179
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,690
but then once that for.
It's weird when a memory gets awakened 

180
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,200
when you didn't think the memory was in 
your head at all and then someone brings

181
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:28,040
it up and also the rebirth,
the balloons comes back to life.

182
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,650
Like someone talks about some shit that 
happened.

183
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:32,060
Like when you were a kid and you're 
like,

184
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,190
oh yeah,
what the fuck,

185
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:36,320
I forgot about that.
All the sudden boom.

186
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:41,321
It was clear when that happens.
That opens up a lot of these little 

187
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:44,471
memories that just because you 
remembered that one thing being will 

188
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:44,471
start remembering like,
oh,

189
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:45,350
and really used to listen to that guy at
the grocery store.

190
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:50,530
Bishop Desmond Tutu gets the gas face.
I don't know how much research was good 

191
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,400
man,
like that guy's flow,

192
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,890
but it seemed like people would pick on 
because he was white.

193
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,170
It was like.
And then he became like a producer 

194
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,170
instead of a wrapper,
which I think was a huge mistake because

195
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,580
I think as a rapper he was really bad 
ass.

196
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:08,520
It was fucking good.
Like I used to love his stuff,

197
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:12,420
but I felt like he was almost sort of 
like doing it but sort of apologizing at

198
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,270
the same time.
She's a junior and he stopped doing it,

199
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,390
but the cashier will never stopped 
rapping and that guy was fucking good.

200
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,850
The idea that he went on to produce some
records.

201
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,660
I'm sure he produced some good to stop 
liking it.

202
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,970
Perform.
I can appreciate that.

203
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:29,760
But I think with him that guy was really
fucking good.

204
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:34,761
I really,
really used to enjoy as shit illegally 

205
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:34,761
down both those albums to know I'm not 
them for fuck,

206
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,050
I'm going to pay when we go to itunes 
and give a fuck.

207
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,830
You gorillas album came out today.
What did you say you didn't like that?

208
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,220
I don't like the single first thing was 
out there for all I know.

209
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,910
Is that one song they do do,
do,

210
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,030
do,
do.

211
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,540
I know,
but I mean if I had to like identify 

212
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:56,540
one.

213
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,530
Anyway,
so you searched.

214
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,500
Please come back.
That's what we're trying to say.

215
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,680
Come.
C'Mon man.

216
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:06,681
I ain't too late.
Just fucking dust off that hat and 

217
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:08,640
fucking let's do this son to step up and
spit out.

218
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,710
I like.
I like rap music,

219
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:11,820
man.
I mean,

220
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,770
I joke about it in my app,
but I really do man.

221
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:15,450
It's fun.
I love that.

222
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,810
You know that they're talking shit.
I like listening to people talk.

223
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,160
She'll love it now.
So that's my landing.

224
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:24,190
No,
that's a great one too.

225
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,180
Not just a great writer,
but hip hop is dead.

226
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:29,490
That's my landing.
Music is.

227
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:32,160
I rotate between three songs.
Hip Hop is dead.

228
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,140
Tori Amos,
crucify.

229
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,120
And voodoo child.
What do you mean about learning music?

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,460
When I land,
as soon as I put my fucking land,

231
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:46,461
my touchdown will come into a new city 
or even the question why the 

232
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:49,180
stewardesses electric heavier earphones 
on during landing first class,

233
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,510
but I knew it.
That's totally true.

234
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:53,450
I always say they never bothered me on 
my class,

235
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,780
but on the back,
like tick it off.

236
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:56,010
Yeah,
they're Nazis in the bag.

237
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,640
You can't totally get away with it,
but you can kind of play dumb.

238
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,680
Like what?
Okay.

239
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,400
Take it off.
I mean,

240
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:04,720
I never don't take it off when they rate
off,

241
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:09,721
I take it off.
You have to tell me I'm not going to 

242
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:09,721
take it off on my own.
The break and if you're sleeping they'll

243
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:10,980
never wake you up.
It will fake sleep.

244
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,160
I'll make sure that my seat is up for 
that,

245
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,350
but you know,
I'm going to do this shit right here and

246
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,690
it should just let it go.
Please.

247
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,750
I'm nice.
It's no one's going to crash because my 

248
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:26,750
fucking head turn it off because radio 
waves.

249
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,380
No,
it's not a real wave.

250
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,000
It's electric.
They want you to turn off everything.

251
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:34,550
They want you to turn off game boys,
you know,

252
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,550
but it's like it's on.
It's nonsense.

253
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:43,551
It's nonsense.
The idea is some sort of electrical 

254
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:46,310
interference,
but I think really the good idea too is 

255
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,891
that it forces people to comply and 
that's the same thing with putting the 

256
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:52,881
seat up,
but you never really thinks it's 

257
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:52,881
ridiculous.
And I used to think it was ridiculous to

258
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:56,481
force people to put their seat up.
But now I think it's important because 

259
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:56,530
you've got to get them to fucking listen
to you.

260
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,990
Well important.
If they do get into a tough,

261
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,390
they don't want you to look lean.
But if you know,

262
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,020
if you can get hurt,
you're going to get hurt.

263
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:06,160
You know,
anything that's going to hurt you.

264
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:08,530
It's not gonna hurt you any less because
you're like this.

265
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:09,820
Then you are like this.
I mean,

266
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,890
you're going to get jacked,
I guess.

267
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:12,850
Maybe.
No,

268
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,940
I can't.
I can't see how even in the most furious

269
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:19,060
turbulence it would make a difference.
I think you're fucked either way.

270
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:20,170
If you're fucked,
you're fucked.

271
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,510
You're on a goddamn metal tube flying 
through the air.

272
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,080
You know?
I think the good thing about it is that 

273
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,080
they get you to comply.
And I think,

274
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,640
you know,
I don't want anybody to tell me what to 

275
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:32,640
do and you don't want anybody to tell 
you what to do,

276
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,690
but let's be honest,
we're not going to do anything fucking 

277
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:36,690
crazy.

278
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,750
You know?
There's a lot of people out there that 

279
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,200
need to be told what to do during the 
landing.

280
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:45,201
I was like,
I'll just go to the bathroom on the 

281
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:45,201
fucking fly all over the place.
Yeah.

282
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:45,690
I think people,
um,

283
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,640
there's a certain amount of people,
you know,

284
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,190
there's just too many of us.
We need very clearly established rules.

285
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,470
Even if they're ridiculous.
Even if it's just like,

286
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,290
it sounds like,
oh,

287
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,730
you're conservative,
but it's not just an expert retards,

288
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,940
you know,
I just know there's just so many fucking

289
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:05,941
dummies out there.
It's very important to have a certain 

290
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:05,941
amount of order to the world,
you know,

291
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:08,890
because even though you don't want that 
order,

292
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,790
you've worked really hard to put 
yourself into a position where you don't

293
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,410
have to have that order.
You know?

294
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,670
I mean,
look at the life you chose,

295
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,120
you went from like a very obvious,
you know,

296
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,150
uh,
you know,

297
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,160
like regular normal person's life to 
being this crazy fucking comedian where 

298
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,790
you know,
you're making your living talking shit 

299
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,860
on stage and you know,
you sleep till noon and it means that,

300
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:30,130
right?

301
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,360
That right there is most people would 
never be able to figure out a way that's

302
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:36,520
just too tricky.
It's too fucked up.

303
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,820
You know,
like most dumb people would never be 

304
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,400
able to figure out a way to slip through
some weird path to make a career doing,

305
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,960
watching your work.
Right now we're not talking about,

306
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:51,160
you know,
well,

307
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:56,161
you know,
nobody really wants to work unless you 

308
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:56,161
love what you're doing and then it's not
working anymore.

309
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:58,570
And that's really the secret to life.
And then everybody loves something else,

310
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:03,571
man.
I mean there's a reason why there's 

311
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:03,571
lawyers.
There's a reason why.

312
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:03,580
There's a lot of dudes who love being 
fucking dentist now.

313
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,790
There's a lot of dudes and loved being 
carpenters and everybody's got their own

314
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,380
thing.
Whatever the fuck it is.

315
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,620
If you want me to find it then it's not 
really work.

316
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,490
You know?

317
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:17,550
And until then it's going to suck.
I still get surprised sometimes on the 

318
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,680
road and be like,
Oh yeah,

319
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,900
okay.
Yeah,

320
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,790
I know.
It's because we do it so often for free,

321
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,380
you know,
especially in La,

322
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,390
how many I'm often do you do sets for 
free?

323
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,710
Oh,
that's what I start.

324
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:27,850
Whenever people ask me like,
Hey,

325
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:29,920
do you want like a future for the third 
show or something or whatever.

326
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:30,580
I'm always,
look,

327
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,760
I've said no before and then it's like,
yeah,

328
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,540
I do a guest spot now once I get there.
So it's like,

329
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,950
yeah.
And you hear the laughter,

330
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:40,840
you just want to go up.
There was,

331
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,090
it was we were in Australia,
the uh,

332
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,020
the,
the flight fucks you up man,

333
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:51,950
because it's like a 16 hour time zone 
and it's like 19 ahead.

334
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:53,810
So it's like literally you're the next 
day,

335
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:54,980
you don't know.
So I was like,

336
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,090
well really delusional.

337
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,110
I kind of,
I didn't know,

338
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,260
but as soon as I got to the club,
I saw the people who have interest 

339
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:02,990
sparks it up,
you know,

340
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:04,010
it's crazy.
It's like Bam,

341
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:05,630
we're going to do a fucking trouble and 
have some fun.

342
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,220
You know,
it's like you just fire up,

343
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,860
you just,
you just get one people,

344
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,310
man,
I wish people in their regular jobs 

345
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:15,310
could feel what we feel when you're 
killing,

346
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,990
you know,
occasionally sleep for a couple hours 

347
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,211
afterwards to go on wired afterwards.
Especially when you got a new bit,

348
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,400
if you have a new button,
that new bid is killing that.

349
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:27,500
It just takes everything up to the next 
level.

350
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,440
You know?
It's crazy.

351
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,550
Comedy is so much fucking fun.
He's seen alice in wonderland yet.

352
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,750
No,
I've heard very mixed reviews.

353
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,580
No,
I am going to watch it.

354
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:41,000
A universal city walk on mushrooms.
When we got back from Tibet,

355
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,550
Arizona.
They're in three D imax.

356
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,710
Disregarding the law.
Have you not had a bad trip before?

357
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,740
No.
That's why he's going to be your bad 

358
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,500
trip.
Here's what I thinking

359
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,580
about bad trips and I think for sure you
could definitely take too much of 

360
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,790
anything and have a bad trip no matter 
what state of mind is.

361
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,100
You know,
I've had that trips on pot.

362
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,380
I've never had bad trips and anything 
else about pot,

363
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,240
but I've had bad trips.
Eating Pot.

364
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,270
I think it's a state of mind.
I think it's how you approach it.

365
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,010
I think it's where you're at when you 
take it,

366
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,270
if you're in a good place.

367
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,540
Last time I did shrooms,
I start shooting and having diarrhea and

368
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,520
know that changes everything.
If you think you're dying,

369
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,310
that's causing mushrooms.
Somebody get into an accident across the

370
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:29,950
street from here.
That's all going back.

371
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,580
Are you doing that second dealer show 
next time?

372
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,620
Sure.
If I can.

373
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:37,650
What is it takes a good show.
April 18th if you haven't seen it or 

374
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,230
heard about it already.
Fear is doing.

375
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:43,231
If you live in la,
he's doing this psychedelic show and he 

376
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:46,000
did it.
When was the last date was in February.

377
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,790
You got some clips on your website.
Look are going to make them better.

378
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,170
Well this,
so the idea of the show is most 

379
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,460
comedians that we know at least most 
funny ones because had a few psychedelic

380
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:03,461
experiences and a lot of them have 
really funny stories to go with them and

381
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,690
so they're all talking about it.
Uh,

382
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,250
you know,
in front of a crowd.

383
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,260
It should be kind of cool.
There's just fun stories.

384
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Anything interesting I've ever learned?
I've already told 100 fucking times.

385
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,220
Right?
I always get it.

386
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,020
Drug experience for you.
Oh God.

387
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,500
In Tempe this weekend.
That's the place to do it,

388
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,490
right?
God spirits in us and said,

389
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,380
you have some Guy Dylan Birdie told the 
story.

390
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,440
You're always supposed to be incredible 
synthetic spirit self.

391
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,660
My friend Matt was in New York and he 
took it and he said he could hear people

392
00:17:37,661 --> 00:17:41,540
talking in a building like straight way 
over there.

393
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,780
I said a glass window,
and he goes,

394
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,790
I can hear them talking.
Meanwhile,

395
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,640
it's probably just like a cell phone 
going off.

396
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,470
I mean,
I think.

397
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,000
I think there's,
there's,

398
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,260
there's ways we can perceive things 
other than the standard way.

399
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,110
I'm not drunk.
I could hear things further away,

400
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:03,111
but like a center,
like at a bar weapon normally hear 

401
00:18:03,111 --> 00:18:03,111
nothing I can set on one person talking 
know,

402
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,680
but people around me then I just see 
them and I hear what they're saying.

403
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,720
That your liver,
your liver,

404
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,380
your liver does it.
Who knows when your liver is what makes 

405
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,170
a week so fucked up when you eat it,
that's when it produces that shit.

406
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,200
It's called 11 hydroxy metabolite.
Apparently it's,

407
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:25,860
it's,
um,

408
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,470
it's,
it's present and smoking it.

409
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,640
When you smoke it,
it's present.

410
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,790
But it's not like a psychoactive levels.
But when you eat it,

411
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
it's processed by your body and it 
produces this fucking insane chemical 

412
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,230
that's like four times more psychoactive
than thc.

413
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,790
That's why when you eat pot sewing,
whoa.

414
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,560
Those brownies or cookies gave us and 
Chicago Shit.

415
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,710
Even fucking Joey Diaz freaked out on 
him.

416
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,780
Joey DSSD had a mild heart attack.
That was the first time.

417
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,970
We're all still high the next day.
And you wake up,

418
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,770
you're just kind of like shuffling your 
feet.

419
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Feel sort of weird.
Like you're still tired until it hits 

420
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:06,800
you,
but you're not.

421
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,430
You're too high to think it out.
So you're like,

422
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,480
oh,
it was so hot.

423
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,000
I reevaluated my entire life.
I really did.

424
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,840
I made some life changing decisions that
night.

425
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,090
I was so fucking gone.
I literally,

426
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,010
I mean,
it was very,

427
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:22,230
very similar to taking mushrooms,
very similar,

428
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,500
just just as intense and just go into a 
different place.

429
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:26,220
It was like,
wow,

430
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:27,360
this is strong.
And you know,

431
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:28,560
how I knew it was really,
really,

432
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:31,410
really strong is my laid in the bed and 
I close my eyes.

433
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:35,940
And the hallucinations were insane.
It was all.

434
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:40,941
Yeah,
it was all these like these cartoon 

435
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:43,581
characters fucking each other and and 
becoming different things and fucking 

436
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,820
each other and becoming different things
if fucking each other and becoming 

437
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:48,820
different things.
It was insane and they were like,

438
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,540
the cartoon characters were like,
like a glowing,

439
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:55,020
almost like a neon.
The handling big glowing neon quality to

440
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:56,940
them.
Like they look like someone drew them,

441
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,480
but then there was like a glowing neon 
like center to him.

442
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,840
It was fucking insane and went on for 
like a half an hour.

443
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,760
I was like,
Holy Shit,

444
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,500
this is just from eating.
We'd,

445
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,320
I started ate mushrooms when I was 
getting sick and stuff.

446
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,350
Then I resorted to bed and it was weird 
because I went into like stages of like 

447
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,910
first I was shaking real fast.
Date I went into like a sweaty and then 

448
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,780
I got into like a thing that I felt like
I was going inside out or something.

449
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,420
It was like seven things,
but it was in a cycle,

450
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,680
like it kept on doing it.
Like I'm like,

451
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,820
all right,
next is coming to shake,

452
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:28,570
right?
Oh yeah.

453
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,610
Here comes a shake and stuff like that 
and then I was like,

454
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,340
wait,
it's like seasons of the Earth Man.

455
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,560
Probably about 150 of those things and 
yeah,

456
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:41,200
I mean that's how bad my last mushroom 
tripwires.

457
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,230
And it was like,
it was sick mixed with thinking I was 

458
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,360
some kind of season.
How much did take a,

459
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,190
about an eighth or half,
an eight,

460
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,790
75 percent of an eight or something like
that.

461
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,970
What does it need?
How many?

462
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,550
How many?
Uh,

463
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,560
people do have maybe

464
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,860
300,
33 point five,

465
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,930
four,
six or something,

466
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,940
right?
They say the real big doses,

467
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,590
like five,
five grams,

468
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,370
five grams.
See some,

469
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,930
you talked to some people and they're 
just like,

470
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:11,530
no,
dude,

471
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:15,720
you got smoke seven joints to get the 
most out of it.

472
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,020
Not really.
The way to really do it right is to not 

473
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,570
smoke pot for a long time and then below
it the fuck out.

474
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,000
Just get high as a kite.
And then you have,

475
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,430
I haven't spoke for the last couple of 
days and I was Paul.

476
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,250
Yeah.
But have you heard it?

477
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:33,251
But that's just a couple of days you 
have you ever.

478
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,880
I talked to those guys like I don't trip
on one hit of aspects or fontane man.

479
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:44,390
You know there are definitely some 
business man,

480
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,310
but don't you think that we all have 
different chemical structures,

481
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:53,190
but it's like,
I bet you they didn't even try the one 

482
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,190
dose thing.
They're just like,

483
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,880
no,
I like to kind of five pizzas.

484
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,630
Have you ever met a dude who just can't 
drink?

485
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,970
I,
especially back in Boston,

486
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:02,680
I knew a lot of guys that they would 
drink and then all of that,

487
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,300
I mean one drink and they were gone.
They just didn't exist.

488
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,380
When I went out with once one drink she 
would go one drink in and then all of a 

489
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,981
sudden she'd be throwing glasses and 
shit and swearing at the same way that 

490
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:18,570
somebody can completely handle.
It was nuts.

491
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,630
It was nuts.
I mean it's one fucking drink and she 

492
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,271
wouldn't be gone one drink.
It was like she was allergic to alcohol 

493
00:22:26,271 --> 00:22:29,961
or something.
There was something weird and she was 

494
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:31,791
completely crazy.
There's one girl I knew that a Jewish 

495
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:32,580
girl she's friends with on facebook,
it might be watching,

496
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:37,581
so I want say her name,
but I first time she smoked weed and 

497
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:37,581
fucking religion,
man.

498
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:38,180
Huh?
Jewish.

499
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,450
I'd have to say that because I went to 
you guys at least have a chance to find 

500
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:43,450
out who.

501
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,090
All right.
So,

502
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:54,680
uh,

503
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,460
we at my house,
it's like I'm not good with weed.

504
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,420
Whatever.
She smoked,

505
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:00,250
one bong hit.
She stood up,

506
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:05,310
ran full speed into my bathroom,
hit the bathtub and just flew in the 

507
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:07,330
bathtub and smashed her face in the 
bathtub.

508
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,740
And I'm like,
but she wasn't.

509
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,410
She just was like,
oh my God.

510
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,320
That was like one hit.

511
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,750
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

512
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:20,990
There's something weird in her.
Whatever DNA that snapped and medial,

513
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
you know,
we also don't realize how strong his 

514
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000
fucking weed is.
Right?

515
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,630
Because Mr.
Ohio Shit.

516
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,660
Really?
Yeah.

517
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,900
This was an Ohio.

518
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,730
Wow.

519
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,100
She's just a freak.
How bad was Ohio's?

520
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:35,370
We'd compared to California.
Oh,

521
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,480
it was Mexican brick.
We.

522
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,760
Is that where it's compressed where at 
least you like this.

523
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,050
I don't have much.
We'd left,

524
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,920
but that one break you're just like 
pulling out long time ago,

525
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,120
maybe it's gotten better and,
and kind

526
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,930
of in California,
I'm sure it's used again,

527
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,590
address broker back then.
So it was probably always existed.

528
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,160
It's,
you know,

529
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:54,340
the people that get arrested for drugs.
Why is it,

530
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:59,350
are we speeding?
You have a life sentence in your car 

531
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,910
while you're doing something stupid,
like throw,

532
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:03,200
always talking on the phone without 
using a headset or.

533
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:08,201
And they get pulled over for that and 
also in the cops like why do I smell 

534
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:08,201
weed?
You know?

535
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:11,300
And then he popped the trunk and he's 
got a fucking giant brick of weed in the

536
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:16,301
back or you're parked on the side of the
road with your door open and a girl 

537
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:16,670
sitting on your lap and you're like,
okay,

538
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:18,500
why do you have a gun in the backseat of
your car?

539
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,530
Why you so nervous?
Sweating?

540
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,860
What is it about these fucking trucks to
get busted?

541
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,400
And they have like 100 million dollars 
for the weed,

542
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,240
like giant fucking semis.

543
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,070
Like how crazy is that?
Like a big gamble.

544
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,280
Let's take a chance.
US get through,

545
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,500
I've been a lost.
They must get through.

546
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,560
I bet 90 percent of them get through it.
They busted one of them in Arizona 

547
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,450
because the guy had a ups drunk.
It was ups trucks stolen.

548
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,890
No,
it wasn't real.

549
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,110
It was a forge,
a fake ups truck.

550
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:53,170
They made a ups truck with fake numbers.
I just took the numbers from one of the 

551
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:53,170
other ups trucks.
They wrote it down.

552
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,370
They recreated a fucking nice truck.
Yeah,

553
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,510
brilliant.
And why are they going to do it?

554
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:59,020
But because the cops ran the fucking 
number that was on it,

555
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:04,030
they were speeding or doing something.
The cops ran the number that was on it 

556
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,840
and it turns out it was,
it was the wrong truck.

557
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,530
It was so like,
no,

558
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:07,560
we're in Michigan match.

559
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,810
It didn't match for whatever reason.
So they decided to pull them up.

560
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,780
I said,
pull this guy over.

561
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:14,360
He's got a giant fucking truckload a 
week.

562
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,760
I mean they just decided to pretend that
they're delivering for ups.

563
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,840
They're pretty good.
Nobody would check it.

564
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,450
They probably got away with it a fuck 
load of times,

565
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,890
you know.
And then one guy just got a little care 

566
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:28,890
list and started driving fast and you 
got Boston.

567
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,620
They always get complacent.
We get away with it,

568
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:35,410
totally normal.
And you feel like I'm not going to get 

569
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:35,410
caught.
You know?

570
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:40,090
I mean that's what.
And that becomes part of the thrill of 

571
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:40,090
it too.
I think for people.

572
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:44,261
There's a lot of people that are 
addicted to crime and they think that 

573
00:25:44,261 --> 00:25:44,670
crime like selling weed or do anything 
illegal where you,

574
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,840
you know,
you don't really even pay taxes on it.

575
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,060
Think there's a fucking a wild outlawed 
real to that shit.

576
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,100
You know,
some people love living like that.

577
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,470
But those mother fuckers,
you can't be around them.

578
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:57,550
They're going to blow up like that shit 
is not going to last like you're,

579
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,580
you're not,
you're not playing by society's rules 

580
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:02,580
when you're running around selling 
drugs.

581
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,130
I liked to get drugs and I think it's 
awesome that you're doing that,

582
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:09,190
but I'll be around you because if you're
the guy who's making his life of 

583
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,190
selling,
you know,

584
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,030
if you're making your life off selling 
cocaine,

585
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,630
like you might be fucking crazy.
You know,

586
00:26:13,631 --> 00:26:16,380
you might just be a reckless wild 
motherfucker.

587
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,870
That's a dangerous thing.
I mean,

588
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,140
how many people get rich and retire off 
of cocaine?

589
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,230
I don't know.
Any.

590
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,520
And then what is a few of the year 
buddy?

591
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,620
Cocaine cowboys.
Really?

592
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,610
She's,
she's still alive.

593
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,350
Cocaine cowboys too.
She got out and like retired now.

594
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,830
They shipped her to Bogota.
She killed her.

595
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:38,300
200 people.
Oh really?

596
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:43,301
Yeah.
She made hundreds of millions of 

597
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:43,301
dollars.
She was killed.

598
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:46,540
Two people overdose are directly 
responsible for like 200 people dying 

599
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,200
off her coke.
Right.

600
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:50,940
What are you doing?
Somebody asked what I was drinking.

601
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,230
I was putting it up to them like 
Weirdos.

602
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,030
It's good.
He's like,

603
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:59,810
I'm here on this chart.
I thought it wasn't fair.

604
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,810
That would be weird.
Really,

605
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,150
really weird.
Anyway,

606
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,140
this is still alive.
They took pictures of her in Bogota,

607
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:08,640
Colombia,
so she got out of jail.

608
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,880
They won't be deported there and now 
she's running around Columbia.

609
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,370
Man,
he's rich as fuck.

610
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,100
She's like incredibly,
incredibly rich and ruthless.

611
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,360
The cocaine cowboys is fucking 
incredible.

612
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:20,490
I thought,
oh my God,

613
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:25,491
you have to watch it.
It's one of the greatest documentaries 

614
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:27,251
ever,
and then cocaine cowboys too is even 

615
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:27,251
better.

616
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:28,410
Cocaine cowboys tube is just fucking 
nuts,

617
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:30,180
man.
Mean it tells you.

618
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:35,181
It just shows you how nutty Miami was in
the 19 eighties when cocaine was coming 

619
00:27:35,181 --> 00:27:35,820
through there.
I mean,

620
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,730
it just changed the fucking face of the 
city.

621
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,330
That city was built on cocaine.
The cops,

622
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:44,880
there were so many corrupt cops that one
year,

623
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,620
the entire graduating group in the 
police academy,

624
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:54,621
the entire graduating group,
all of them either wound up dead or 

625
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:55,620
locked up in jail.
Really?

626
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,730
Yup.
All of them.

627
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,010
I hate Miami so much.
Oh my God.

628
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:02,630
It's so crazy and that's why it's the 
coke.

629
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,000
It's a cocaine flavors city.
There's a lot of cool people in Miami,

630
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:07,470
man.
I had a show recently.

631
00:28:07,471 --> 00:28:09,570
I did the Lincoln theater was fucking 
awesome,

632
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:11,040
man.
It was really awesome.

633
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,380
Everybody was super cool to show was 
nice,

634
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,660
but fuck man.
That,

635
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,630
that Improv.

636
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,770
Perhaps the worst improv comedy club 
I've ever been to ever.

637
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,470
That Miami Improv made me stop going to 
Miami.

638
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,070
It was so bad.
They would just yell out shit.

639
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,550
Nobody gave a fuck,
it was just like tables,

640
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,720
just screaming at the top and you shut 
up.

641
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:35,721
What giant room full of coke heads.
I mean just a room full of coke heads.

642
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:37,950
We're not even lying about this.
Like if,

643
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,240
if we had 200 people in the crowd,
how many people do you think were coke 

644
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,240
heads?
How many?

645
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,780
200.
I'd say 80 to 80.

646
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:46,790
We're on coke.
80.

647
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,040
Iranco 40 doesn't have any on them.
That's not bullshit.

648
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,160
And the 40 that didn't have it on,
they might get shitty because they're 

649
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,070
coming down.
I mean really it was fucking.

650
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,570
That place was crazy.
And Cuban Cuban cooked up in that place 

651
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,220
is one of the one place is.

652
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:08,350
I've never heard headliner get more 
sabotage when they decided to put Kevin 

653
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:12,600
Mania after Joey Diaz.
You're talking Cuban and cokehead.

654
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,220
That's what I mean.
The audience is Cuban,

655
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,170
right?
The audience does.

656
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:20,990
Does,
you know coke and Shelly?

657
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:25,620
It has like an hour of material.
He could go on and on way.

658
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,180
He says it's so funny you say that 
sounds funny.

659
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,160
I think it say somebody just die 
laughing.

660
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:31,650
You're like,
oh,

661
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:33,650
you know about this.
He says,

662
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:35,760
Shit that I don't even know.
I've never done coke,

663
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:37,950
but it's funny just because there are 
times a lady on a Thursday,

664
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,370
you know?
I don't know if he,

665
00:29:42,371 --> 00:29:44,770
if he does that to a room full of coke 
heads.

666
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,990
Oh my God.
Joe Used to destroy them.

667
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:53,570
He was still level that motherfucker.
He was on stage once and he was spitting

668
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,040
and sweat was flying off him and he was 
telling jokes about being in one window.

669
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,480
They're both on coke,
humane is cat and he's in one window and

670
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:07,210
the cats and the other one and they 
fucking looking out for police.

671
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,620
I don't think I've ever left any harder.
I don't think I've ever left any higher.

672
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,430
And Joey,
so Julie's leveling these audiences with

673
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:20,431
this kind of material.
And Kevin Meeney went up after him and 

674
00:30:20,431 --> 00:30:22,110
Kevin me this before Kevin Meehan count 
came out of the closet for Ketamine.

675
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,580
He was doing like he used to do.
We are the world.

676
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,500
We are the world.
The tribute thing,

677
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:31,270
like a whole song that was closing bit,
but this was like decades after that.

678
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:33,310
We are the word,
nobody remembered that anymore and these

679
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:38,311
20 year old people in the audience had 
no idea what the fuck he was talking 

680
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:38,830
about and this is after Joe Papp and 
yeah,

681
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,550
they're in their animals and this is 
after Joe.

682
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,510
He goes up and she always just leveling 
the place.

683
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:48,511
I mean it was,
it hurts you to watch it hurt you to 

684
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:49,540
watch.
That's one of the worst.

685
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,690
Like scheduling of comics ever.
They do that all the time.

686
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,170
Like especially like the punisher.
No,

687
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,270
they did to people like not smart comic 
wants too much money.

688
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:59,660
Sometimes they'll do that,
you know,

689
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,960
some,
some people don't think of guys that 

690
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,081
good,
like some bones are really fucking 

691
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:07,081
stupid.
He's just responding.

692
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:07,900
Well,
what I heard was the one who I heard got

693
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:11,320
fuck with the most was Mitch Hedberg.
Mitch Hedberg got fucked with a bunch of

694
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:14,350
times where they would put on like these
singing black guys before him,

695
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,800
you know,
and these guys would destroy with like 

696
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,230
really dumb hack shit.
And then Mitch Hedberg regard whether 

697
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,200
it's really weird,
unique act,

698
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,540
you know,
that like on paper isn't even funny,

699
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:25,940
you know,
it's like,

700
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,280
it's got some great stuff,
like an interesting way of delivering,

701
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,460
but it was,
it's very much you have to set it up 

702
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:35,460
correctly.

703
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,370
You can't have some guy going up singing
and dancing and having a full audience 

704
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,810
clap along.
And then Hedberg who just basically 

705
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,300
stands there and you know,
doubletree hotel,

706
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:50,491
you know,
if he's got like all these weird jokes 

707
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:50,491
that are like,
they're just so,

708
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:50,491
you know,
so uniquely him.

709
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,730
But you got to set it up,
right.

710
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,020
You know,
and that's,

711
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,690
that's part of comedy.
Let people go there.

712
00:31:54,691 --> 00:31:56,590
God can follow that guy.
It doesn't mean that,

713
00:31:56,591 --> 00:32:01,591
that guy's not good.
It means that they're actually aren't 

714
00:32:01,591 --> 00:32:02,560
compatible if people don't have a harder
time following the other people.

715
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,830
But those people would have a harder 
time following people that I don't know.

716
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:12,070
Sometimes titles.
There's a lot of guys like really super 

717
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,710
cerebral and really wordy and doesn't 
swear and Israeli,

718
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,920
you know.
Then you go up and you want to talk 

719
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:19,920
about get your Dick sucked.

720
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:19,920
You know,
people are like,

721
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,280
Whoa,
fuck earns for some reason and we're 

722
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,010
killing it.
I would always do well when other people

723
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,210
are killing that I have trouble and it's
like I don't.

724
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,650
Yeah,
I just styles.

725
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,770
Yeah.
Joey used to have his,

726
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,990
his jenks used to be a Jamal,
you remember?

727
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,400
Oh,
he was amazing.

728
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,850
Incredible timing agents.
Most such a proud man.

729
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,140
He just,
his timing was just so perfect.

730
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:48,160
You hear the same jokes 10 times in a 
row and he's still would laugh and for 

731
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,641
whatever reason I think that just got 
inside Joey's head because Joey wasn't 

732
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:51,980
that kind of a guy who wasn't a 
technician,

733
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,890
like a j.
Jamal just had that perfect timing.

734
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,770
It just,
the way he would do it,

735
00:32:57,771 --> 00:33:01,250
like you would just be recovered from 
the last job and then the next one would

736
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:01,760
hit you.
But we,

737
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,900
he do the right time.

738
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:08,110
Like why we're still appreciating that 
show and then other one hits you and he 

739
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,490
would hit you with these waves and jelly
was just a,

740
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,790
you know,
sort of like stream of consciousness guy

741
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:17,830
which just go up.
We had a couple ideas of some jokes he 

742
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:17,830
would talk about,
but he want to just fuck around.

743
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,080
They wanted to like,
find,

744
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:23,110
find the material onstage.
I think it bothered him with this guy 

745
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,110
was like so,
uh,

746
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,380
so rigid and that used to bother me a 
lot too.

747
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:31,390
And I had a really strong impact,
was really strong and well done.

748
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:33,140
It would make me insecure.
I would say,

749
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,650
what is mine that good and I'm not doing
what he's doing.

750
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,640
Have trouble falling asleep if somebody 
does real real well with crowd work.

751
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,810
But it's like,
because then that's my

752
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,290
pull up move and gives some power.
But then it's like,

753
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,520
well he just did it already.
He did it better than you.

754
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:49,860
It's not my one cheat move his fucking 
taken away

755
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,240
from it.
Yeah.

756
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,510
Yeah.
The crowd was a good move.

757
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:56,280
If you get,
if you've got a position to go to it.

758
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,390
I don't want to say the job,
but you know,

759
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,940
there's one that you do where,
you know,

760
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:02,140
you talked to a check in the audience 
and it,

761
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,010
you know,
you,

762
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,350
you,
I always wait for it.

763
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:11,351
Like when you started talking about that
and then I go here comes like if you're 

764
00:34:11,351 --> 00:34:11,960
in a tricky situation,
he bust that one out.

765
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,230
That's just a crack in the face,
you know,

766
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,320
but those are nice to me.
It's really no different than any other 

767
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,590
kind of job that you're gonna just mean 
you're recreating the moment,

768
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,130
you know,
you're,

769
00:34:22,131 --> 00:34:24,830
you're saying it all like you're 
thinking it right there and then.

770
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:26,660
But a lot of it is shit.
You said many,

771
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:31,661
many times before,
you just got to keep it as organic as 

772
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:31,661
possible.
The electrode,

773
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:35,000
because it sets my mouth to be like this
is a real clock on.

774
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,640
That's smart.
Yeah.

775
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,340
Why jokes on went to the store.
It sounds gross.

776
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:42,940
Yeah,

777
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,940
it does.
When is it ever sound grosser than when 

778
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,520
you're in a tiny little audience?
When a audience,

779
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:53,590
like three people,
you see all the problems with your 

780
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:57,091
material,
like tiny audiences are really good to 

781
00:34:57,091 --> 00:34:57,091
do because when you perform in front of 
like three people,

782
00:34:57,091 --> 00:35:00,070
it's so uncomfortable that you're making
this person talk to you.

783
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,130
The illusion of a crowd is just gone.
It's just like,

784
00:35:03,131 --> 00:35:05,520
what are we doing?
I prefer for two ones,

785
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,660
two people at danger fields in New York 
City,

786
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,690
and it was one of the.
It's the weirdest feeling.

787
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,440
It makes you snip out the fat and your 
jokes.

788
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,650
It makes you get to the point quicker.
You respect their attention span more 

789
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,070
because it's more ridiculous for you to 
require them to listen to you,

790
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,230
but you also can't pretend like you're 
doing a pause.

791
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:25,380
That might be setting their theatrical.
Even a good word.

792
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,830
Yeah.
I can't even do it now.

793
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,800
It's not even a bad thing.
Just seems really fucking weird.

794
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:32,350
Fucking fake.
You find out what the fake shit is.

795
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,470
You can do a pause if you're really 
thinking that way.

796
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,030
You know if you're like,
you know,

797
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,520
there's a moment you app.
We're like,

798
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,350
what?
What the fuck?

799
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,720
What is really,
what is that?

800
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:47,750
There is a real moment.
There's a real opportunity for a moment 

801
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:47,750
there,
but it has to be real.

802
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,561
I think very often we write stuff and we
write it and we say it in a way we just 

803
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:55,551
know it's going to kill you know,
and it's not necessarily the way you'd 

804
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:55,551
say it in front of a small group of 
people.

805
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:57,300
It's good to clean your act up with that
shit.

806
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,360
It's good to do shows where people 
aren't impressed too.

807
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:05,620
Like that's why it's good to do those 
improv shows like those Wednesday night 

808
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,110
shows because they don't know.
You Ain't gonna be there.

809
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,820
They're not your fans.
They don't come to see you.

810
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:13,821
They come to see any kind of comedy and 
just saw 10 guys that had been on 

811
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:13,821
television.

812
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:15,630
The guy from comedy jokes just wrote me 
yesterday and he was like,

813
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,250
Hey,
uh,

814
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,840
already we'd love to have you come back.
And they did it before and I like,

815
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,060
oh cool.
I didn't want them that.

816
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:21,960
The guy who booked it left.
Um,

817
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,930
so I've been looking at to get in 
contact with you.

818
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,540
And he was like,
yeah,

819
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:26,430
anytime you want next week,
the week after the week after that.

820
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:29,270
And I was like,
how about the week after that?

821
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,630
This is Ari?
And he goes,

822
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,620
oh no,
how about April?

823
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:32,820
And I'm like,
you thought it was area spirits?

824
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,860
Then he was like,
yeah,

825
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:39,861
I did.
I think an auto completed on it or 

826
00:36:39,861 --> 00:36:39,861
whatever.
And I was like,

827
00:36:39,861 --> 00:36:40,340
it's fine man.
That habits.

828
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,940
No,
the webcams on guys.

829
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:52,230
Tell me a little story.
We're not stare at people that my 

830
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,891
manager called,
you know the guy that no one else knows 

831
00:36:54,891 --> 00:36:56,010
everything.
I thought that was a good story man.

832
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,240
I'm fucking.
He wanted to go to comedy Jews comedy 

833
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,830
juices.
Was it all related man coming juices.

834
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:05,730
The local show on Wednesday nights at 
the Improv.

835
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:07,340
Really good show.
And there's always like,

836
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,680
you know,
famous Louis Ck and stop mark Merrill 

837
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:12,750
stopped by.
All these good guys stopped by.

838
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,020
So it's a good place to perform,
but it's good to do like little time 

839
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,020
shitholes too,
right?

840
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,860
It's good to do like bars and dives and 
you know,

841
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:22,140
what's great is that little room next to
the Improv.

842
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,170
You know there's the big improv because 
it's that little tiny ass during the 

843
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:27,170
winter coat show.
What?

844
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,150
Show show?
No,

845
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:28,420
no,
no,

846
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:28,530
no.

847
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,500
I mean in Tempe.
Oh yeah,

848
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,170
no,
that one.

849
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,090
No,
never going to watch.

850
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,310
I just watched todd glass goes and just 
does that room.

851
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,980
No,
so fucking sweet roadmap.

852
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:45,060
You know what I mean?
It's one of the suites rooms in the 

853
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,401
country and is connected to one of the 
biggest firms in the country in all 

854
00:37:46,401 --> 00:37:46,401
things.
It's like a comedy complex.

855
00:37:46,401 --> 00:37:47,700
It's amazing.
The Tempe has so much comedy,

856
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,500
you know?
It's.

857
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,930
It's also the biggest virgin with it 
said Chicago might be bigger.

858
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,970
Now listen to me in west palm is bigger 
than all other.

859
00:37:57,571 --> 00:38:01,830
They redid it is west palm is shoes.
It's like 700 people.

860
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,650
It's fucking insane.
You walk in and you're like,

861
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:06,540
what?
Like it's so big.

862
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,280
What is San Jose have?
Let's see,

863
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:12,420
like $500 for 5,700
people,

864
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,630
something like that.
At least six,

865
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,990
but apparently it's hard to fucking 
fail.

866
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,330
That's hard to go to.
Bruce,

867
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:20,080
bruce and good real quizzes every other 
week.

868
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:27,330
CFA on his twitter the other day he had 
with some guy who was making fun of them

869
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:30,540
or something.
That type portfolio would have happened.

870
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,820
It's just.
It's very crazy.

871
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:37,830
I'll.
This guy got to him and he just started 

872
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:37,830
shooting.

873
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,360
I own you.
I bet you spend more time on me than any

874
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:45,370
other comedians.
He actually like I own you and the 

875
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,130
punisher publicly show somebody else 
online.

876
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,320
You're not showing them up.
You're just.

877
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,360
It's just,
you're both of you guys just back 

878
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,360
because I can't ever hear a response.
I did that before.

879
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,400
You feel like an idiot,
you know,

880
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,790
afterwards,
why did I waste my time doing this?

881
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,290
But there's sometimes where you read 
something,

882
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:00,910
someone will say something Douchey and 
you're like,

883
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:02,890
I can just crush this idiot right now.
What?

884
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:03,940
I'm going to cry.
And then I was like,

885
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,730
what am I doing here?
Why am I entering in?

886
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,490
Like people are just drawing into some 
silly fight.

887
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,400
Twitter.
Talk about that.

888
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,770
And they said to Marin and they said,
oh,

889
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,480
it's like the Special Olympics.
Even if you win,

890
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:17,690
just so retarded.
Yeah.

891
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,620
That's like a dessert,
like a picture of that.

892
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,330
It'd be really funny.
Inspirational pictures.

893
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,230
Would it be really funny?
It's,

894
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:28,870
you don't.
Somebody have like this online war or 

895
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,460
somebody I just haven't gone back and 
forth and get became.

896
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:31,900
So daisy,
you go to fight them.

897
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,480
It's like a 44 year old.

898
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,540
Well,
the thought is your kid.

899
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:37,340
It was

900
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,300
25 kid from a call from Ohio.
We brought them to the show.

901
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,160
Turned out to be just a kid fucking 
around.

902
00:39:43,161 --> 00:39:45,560
He was a nice guy.
I met him.

903
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:50,561
I talked to him on that.
Jimmy can't tell tone to he and I had a 

904
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:53,240
space battle and it was a really 
ridiculous.

905
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,610
And um,
uh,

906
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,160
it got put on some websites and then 
when I went and I,

907
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:03,220
like,
he and I went back and forth on it and 

908
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,220
even in the emails he said like,
you know,

909
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:03,220
alright,
you win.

910
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:08,020
And he said,
if I ever meet you I would be to shake 

911
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,020
your hand.
I said,

912
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,020
I'll check your attitude so I'll just 
fun.

913
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,900
Right?
And he goes,

914
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:09,440
yeah.
He goes,

915
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:10,220
well,
it's nice talking to you.

916
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:11,300
I give the end.
Did like,

917
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:12,560
okay,
you know,

918
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:14,090
I mean it was really weird.
It was like,

919
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,000
you know,
sometimes you talk shit to people,

920
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,180
you don't really mean what you're 
saying,

921
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:22,181
but it's like you're,
you've ventured into like a little 

922
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:22,181
contest.

923
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:24,790
So you want to talk stupid.
Do you want to say some dumb shit while 

924
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,371
I'm up?
The of the people that think just 

925
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:27,710
insulting your mother will do the trick.
Oh,

926
00:40:27,711 --> 00:40:29,840
come on,
I fucked your mom three times.

927
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:31,660
Boom.
Teams.

928
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,490
But for comics and for us,
that's a fun exercise.

929
00:40:34,491 --> 00:40:39,491
Sometimes that's the problem.
It's like when people know that you do 

930
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:39,491
like to get mad at you,
like,

931
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:41,410
who wouldn't asshole?
He's calling this guy loser.

932
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,120
Maybe you're a fucking loser.
You think you're fucking bad ass because

933
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:45,380
you're on TV.
But no,

934
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:47,450
I'm just practicing dealing with Douche 
bags.

935
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,910
It's like they're like online hecklers.
It's like the same thing as a heckler in

936
00:40:50,911 --> 00:40:55,911
an audience.
It's really the same thing and just 

937
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:55,911
breaking them down for a comic.
That's fun.

938
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,280
Sometimes I wish he would throw it 
online.

939
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,950
I don't do it online anymore.
I used to.

940
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,220
It's just so stupid.
It's like you're,

941
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:08,260
you're,
you're deciding to get upset and to 

942
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,290
enter into this little,
this little competition with someone who

943
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,570
you don't know who chooses to interact 
with you.

944
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:16,571
That's what,
that's the way they choose to interact 

945
00:41:16,571 --> 00:41:18,371
with you.
They choose to attack you and you're 

946
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:18,371
just going to submit to that and start 
going back and forth,

947
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:20,510
and that's ridiculous that they win 
right away.

948
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:25,511
You're,
that's just part of being in the public 

949
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:25,790
eye.
Part of being an entertainer.

950
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,590
You're going to get people that want to 
hate you.

951
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,440
That's normal.
As soon as you get back involved,

952
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,370
you're like,
maybe I'll show them up.

953
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:33,380
You won't.
No matter what energy,

954
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,210
that's what it is.
It's a waste of energy.

955
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:39,560
Unless you can do it and you're just 
having fun and it's good natured and you

956
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:44,561
know,
and you do it just for shits and 

957
00:41:44,561 --> 00:41:44,561
giggles.

958
00:41:44,561 --> 00:41:47,590
As long as it's good nature,
but if you're really getting upset and 

959
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:47,590
you're really trying to hurt their 
feelings,

960
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:52,191
so my role is to is if you will just 
want to show them the error of their 

961
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:52,191
ways.
You never will.

962
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:53,450
They'll never see it.
Felt.

963
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,460
Think that they showed you up some rare 
for like a reflective moment,

964
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:03,080
like you know what man you might be able
to with with no aggression.

965
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:05,390
Like you might be able to show someone 
like just,

966
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,800
you know,
a very calm way.

967
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:09,050
It's very hard.
It's very hard for them to accept it,

968
00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:14,051
but the occasional person will accept 
the occasional person who's just 

969
00:42:14,051 --> 00:42:14,051
confused.
A lot of people mad.

970
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:19,060
The reason why they lash out is because 
really they just want someone to love 

971
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:19,060
them.
There's no one loves them.

972
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:23,170
You know?
And this is all a lot of fucking humans 

973
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:23,170
out there,
man.

974
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:23,450
There's a lot of people that they live 
these terrible fucking lives.

975
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,160
I think.
I don't know who it was.

976
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,190
I think it was some fucking famous guy,
Ralph Emerson.

977
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,610
I don't remember who it was her.
This is this quote.

978
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:40,120
Oh fuck,
goddammit.

979
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,030
Hi Taylor.
Got To A.

980
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:49,030
Somebody yelled at him in the 
supermarket parking lot because we're 

981
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,030
going in the wrong way and somebody is,
you know,

982
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,570
I got into an accident once that way and
he said,

983
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:51,500
he goes,
yeah,

984
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:53,390
I bet you got to an accident.
Someone's going the right way.

985
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,080
What does that mean?
Anything quote?

986
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,210
What was it was November.
I don't remember too much weed.

987
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,330
Alright.
Tempe,

988
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,220
Arizona.
This clicker.

989
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,140
And there's been a lot of good questions
or the questions.

990
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,610
Give us one.
Brian sent it out loud.

991
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,130
Start talking about comedy.
I don't know.

992
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:18,900
Uh,
how,

993
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,020
what are the other questions in the 
question for them?

994
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:32,570
Listen,
you don't have to watch it float if 

995
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,970
you're not enjoying it.
You just fucking gone.

996
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,770
I give up on the Oscars when,
uh,

997
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,720
in the bedroom last to that fucking 
terrible mine or whatever.

998
00:43:39,721 --> 00:43:42,230
The split personality going on.
I was just like,

999
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,340
oh,
more than Avatar.

1000
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:47,630
And that just hurts my soul because I 
know that you like the hurt locker,

1001
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,310
but I just,
it hurts me to why?

1002
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:55,460
Because especially when the boring ass 
fucking movie and I just can't 

1003
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,040
understand why everyone thinks it's like
the next awesome thing if the movie they

1004
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,470
like or don't like when some fucking 
award one.

1005
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,620
Because then there's a movie like Avatar
that's just something brand new.

1006
00:44:04,621 --> 00:44:09,621
Like I've never seen this before.
I've never experienced anything like 

1007
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:13,431
this before.
Did you get an appetite depression when 

1008
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:15,030
you found out it wasn't real?
There's a whole thing with that.

1009
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:18,160
People miss that because it's like a 
form of depression,

1010
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,650
you know?
I've only seen it once,

1011
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,020
minister,
you saw it three times.

1012
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:26,021
I've seen it one,
so I'm just saying I thought together.

1013
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,460
It's fun,
man.

1014
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,620
It was a fun movie.

1015
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,370
It was like a God damn comic book or 
going to the common man.

1016
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,700
It's just like the Pocahontas so shut 
up,

1017
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,350
shut the fuck up.
I don't care.

1018
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,020
I like stories that wrap up nice and 
neat.

1019
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,140
Whatever.
People say that shit shorty.

1020
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:44,820
Shorter Shit.
He was like,

1021
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,120
no,
no,

1022
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:50,121
you're right.
When they pointed out that that was a 

1023
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:50,121
little out of a little bit,
but whatever.

1024
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:54,051
It's fun.
No good reason I care is because it 

1025
00:44:54,051 --> 00:44:54,051
seems like.
Okay,

1026
00:44:54,051 --> 00:44:54,120
you saw the same movie.
I saw.

1027
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,170
You think that was enough to be amazing.
That window.

1028
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,260
That's weird.
I think I'm on a brave,

1029
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,440
like a wave length.
What people's intelligence and how 

1030
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:06,440
they're thinking and that just blows it 
out of the water.

1031
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,260
Like there was a million movies

1032
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,430
better than hurt locker.
I think I liked the hurt locker math.

1033
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:11,510
I was pretty good.
That's going to be the year.

1034
00:45:11,511 --> 00:45:13,160
You know what I didn't like.
No,

1035
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,690
no.
I thought it was a unique movie.

1036
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,300
I thought it was.
I don't know.

1037
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:21,310
I think probably because of the fact 
that we're in this middle is unpopular 

1038
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,430
war and it was very,
it was actually art at a point.

1039
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,920
I think so pointless will warn you know,
but um,

1040
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,430
you know,
a solution.

1041
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:31,250
That's one of the reasons why you got 
extra special treatment.

1042
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,620
I mean,
I think if this was done and who knows,

1043
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:38,830
it could be done during the year where 
there's no water will reflect on how we 

1044
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:40,130
don't have more movies all the time,
but I thought it was pretty good.

1045
00:45:40,131 --> 00:45:41,330
Man.
I really liked it.

1046
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:46,390
I've watched it.
Granted while being held captive on a 

1047
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:46,390
plane,
you,

1048
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:46,820
I couldn't go anywhere else in my seat.
I couldn't go anywhere.

1049
00:45:46,821 --> 00:45:51,821
And so I enjoyed it.
I was actually looking forward to it 

1050
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:51,821
because I've heard a lot of people said 
good things about it.

1051
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:53,120
I thought it was pretty good.
It was interesting.

1052
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:54,560
It wasn't.
I didn't know too much about it,

1053
00:45:54,561 --> 00:45:56,990
so that was good.
I didn't know any spoilers.

1054
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:00,830
It captivated me the whole way.
That movie took place four years ago.

1055
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,810
Right.
That scene of that movie.

1056
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,880
But here at the beginning,
I think he's playing xbox 30,

1057
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,240
60 fucking funny.

1058
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,820
I read that last night.
Fucking cat.

1059
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,800
My first commercial knocked out.
My course was thorough the my first 

1060
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,570
commercial.
Well that's interesting man.

1061
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,300
So did you read about this online or did
you figure it out yourself?

1062
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,890
Easter egg?
No,

1063
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,800
the Xbox PC.

1064
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:29,320
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1065
00:46:29,321 --> 00:46:29,640
yeah.
I'm,

1066
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:34,170
I'm a movie nerd like that.
I read it.

1067
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:38,060
Or You could say the date of the movie,
like I guess so yeah.

1068
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:43,150
Tip.
It was uncontacted or something like 

1069
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:43,150
that.
Yes,

1070
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:43,150
it was for you thought it was great to 
too.

1071
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,170
So you guys didn't sit there and go,
wow.

1072
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:51,330
I just watched one really slow mission.
There was a little more crazy actually.

1073
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,840
Yeah.
But I never knew what the fuck was 

1074
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:56,940
happening.
It wouldn't be exciting and you shot two

1075
00:46:56,941 --> 00:47:01,941
times,
but the first time you did not fucking 

1076
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:01,941
know that I was not going to blow up.
Yeah,

1077
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:02,850
and it was very scary.
There was a part in the beginning of the

1078
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:05,640
movie when that guy blows up spoiled.
There's a lot of shit that happened.

1079
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,830
See,
I never felt the tension.

1080
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,040
Tension,
tension though.

1081
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,850
It was an excellent.
We're getting Jack what you're saying.

1082
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,340
There were a couple of times we'd feel 
authentic but.

1083
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,410
But a lot of it was slow.
It was slow.

1084
00:47:18,411 --> 00:47:23,411
I understand that.
The attention perks I guess with dental 

1085
00:47:23,411 --> 00:47:23,411
work and they failed.

1086
00:47:23,411 --> 00:47:24,750
Well,
I wasn't stones.

1087
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,530
They succeeded.
They don't have to be.

1088
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:27,890
I wasn't.
I wasn't.

1089
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,160
I was totally sober.
I

1090
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,410
was in bed going.
I mean I was at the movie theater,

1091
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,810
a movie theater and I didn't see 
anything.

1092
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,240
Maybe that's the problem,
man.

1093
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,300
You in the ship copy.
It was at Blue Ray pop.

1094
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:49,550
Rick.
I mean it was at the Imax theater and 

1095
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,140
three days to fuck Brian.
What are the Ria?

1096
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,500
Busted down your doors.
Took you out of here.

1097
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:57,050
You don't have anything illegal on,
you know,

1098
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:02,490
just everything about that man.
Do you think we're getting really close 

1099
00:48:04,001 --> 00:48:09,001
to the point where you can just download
shit and put it directly on your TV and 

1100
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:10,230
super high quality in real time?
We were there,

1101
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:15,530
but I mean like I heard about it.
People do really easily with Mac Minis 

1102
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,160
and stuff like that and make money with 
movies.

1103
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,720
Well,
people are still going to the movies,

1104
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,220
right?
Sure.

1105
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:21,230
I don't care.
Yeah,

1106
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,020
it'd be nice if everyone else does 
except me.

1107
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,420
People still down there.
Maybe.

1108
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,730
Was there any copies of Avatar online 
anywhere?

1109
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,300
Yeah,
but a lot of people still went to see 

1110
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,491
that.
That's the whole point is that you will 

1111
00:48:38,491 --> 00:48:38,491
download like stupid comedies and you're
just like,

1112
00:48:38,491 --> 00:48:40,480
I'm not paying to see that.
I'll fucking downloads with Sony.

1113
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:44,200
Has a new TV coming out that's a three d
TV right out of a mall.

1114
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,500
It comes out this summer.
Right?

1115
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:49,240
It's fucking crazy.
You put goggles on.

1116
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:54,241
They have a battery,
you press a button and these guys are 

1117
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:54,241
playing soccer and the ball is just 
flying.

1118
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:57,010
It models the TV,
the TV's wacky.

1119
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,290
My other goggles on.
You look at it like,

1120
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:04,410
oh,
so you look at right now it's a capable 

1121
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,541
of Samsung.
You Hook up a computer to it and it 

1122
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:08,440
renders anything in three d into three d
just like that.

1123
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:11,830
So when Avatar comes out on three d,
You can do that until it gets to.

1124
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:17,070
But so I'm not going to buy those 
goggles and programming is like for us,

1125
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:18,740
the office.
Is that coming through?

1126
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,060
That's a good question.
I don't know how the crazy.

1127
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:24,090
I don't think the three d is going to 
catch on program,

1128
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,980
but how many people you might think it's
cool,

1129
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,560
but you know how many people are like,
you know what,

1130
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,730
I'm going to buy a whole new tv just so 
I could have this three d.

1131
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,610
especially after they've made us all 
bond new ones.

1132
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,950
Work.
HDTV took a long blue rays.

1133
00:49:35,951 --> 00:49:38,050
Barely still kept holding on.
That's true.

1134
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:43,080
That's true because regular TV still 
looks pretty fucking bad ass and people 

1135
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:43,080
go,
how much better is it?

1136
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,360
Really Bucks instead of 20 bucks.
No,

1137
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:50,370
in this economy you pay 20 bucks and you
get the right middle one could give a 

1138
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:53,401
shit and honestly three d to me man,
like even when I go to the imax movie 

1139
00:49:53,401 --> 00:49:53,410
theaters,
I'm still kinda like,

1140
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:54,100
you know what?

1141
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,210
I don't know if I like this yet,
you know,

1142
00:49:56,211 --> 00:50:01,211
like it's Kinda cool,
but you need to just go ahead and suck 

1143
00:50:01,211 --> 00:50:02,020
some caulk.
Just go run.

1144
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:07,070
In San Francisco it's getting better and
better on to wherever the hardest cock 

1145
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,051
you thinks gonna be awaiting.
It's getting better and better and 

1146
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:13,411
better,
but you still feel like they're looking 

1147
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:13,510
through something.
Like it still hasn't gotten to the point

1148
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:16,270
where I'm like,
I completely disagree.

1149
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,120
I go to that movie theater and it 
doesn't feel perfect,

1150
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:24,270
but I've put those glasses on and I 
watched those dudes in Avatar floating 

1151
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:24,270
inside that room.
I was like,

1152
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:25,300
Holy Shit,
this is awesome.

1153
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:28,040
That movie is an event.
It's not just

1154
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,040
a movie.
It's not just you go and watch a bunch 

1155
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,040
of shit happen.
The thing that's great about Avatar,

1156
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,280
it's like a Goddamn comic book,
right?

1157
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,730
It's like a ride,
like a super ride at universal city walk

1158
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:39,170
and it's one of the things I said about 
it,

1159
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:41,810
like the acting is Kinda clunky.
Alright,

1160
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,780
so going weaver sounds like she's 
nailing it in a bunch of times.

1161
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:46,850
Yeah.
She gave you the fuck up.

1162
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:48,140
Like,
come on guys.

1163
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,780
Are we serious here?
Where's my cigarette?

1164
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:51,800
It's like,
whoa.

1165
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,980
It seemed like the kind of acting that 
you see in those rides at universal city

1166
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:57,650
walk like right before you go on the 
ride.

1167
00:50:57,651 --> 00:51:02,651
They make you watch them back to the 
future clip where they explained what 

1168
00:51:02,651 --> 00:51:02,960
happened.
We were in a bad situation guys.

1169
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,620
We've got to get through the tone for 
the nuclear bomb.

1170
00:51:05,621 --> 00:51:08,790
Looks like just don't much time please 
in an orderly fashion.

1171
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:13,830
Hurry up and get into your chair.
My popcorn wasn't laying when,

1172
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:19,500
when they said when all the other armies
came out to fight them and was like,

1173
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:24,510
oh,
we got all the other risk about like 

1174
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:24,510
what we were there the whole time.
I've heard about them.

1175
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:28,050
They're right over there.
So why don't you just get them earlier?

1176
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:34,050
Yeah.
Like what are you guys doing in order 

1177
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:34,050
for it to really work?
They all,

1178
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:38,231
these places that bought their hd 
cameras now have to buy three d cameras 

1179
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:43,380
and like all these shows have to be 
filmed a different way and that's going 

1180
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:43,380
to happen,
Brian,

1181
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:43,790
because he used to have to do black and 
white.

1182
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:49,090
That's what they did.
They did black and white with black 

1183
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:49,090
color who hasn't called hd.
They're kind of go,

1184
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:50,570
why?
Why wouldn't ended up happened already?

1185
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:56,550
Because the media has been huge.
The next technology isn't that 

1186
00:51:59,050 --> 00:51:59,530
interesting.

1187
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,310
During the black and white early color 
years of television,

1188
00:52:02,311 --> 00:52:04,160
when you first saw the red,
you would probably.

1189
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,340
This is a break year to someone who saw 
jaws.

1190
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:12,341
Three d theater.
The shark comes at you like,

1191
00:52:13,721 --> 00:52:13,770
yeah,

1192
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:20,190
it's so dumb.
Back then you also thought video games 

1193
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:22,370
were like this that were like amazing.
That's why things improve and technology

1194
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:24,440
advances and that's why three days 
finally come into its own.

1195
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,180
I just think that three d would have 
been popular.

1196
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:31,880
It was good.
There's no way you got greedy.

1197
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,780
I think it's the future for sure.
Movies away.

1198
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,640
Way more excited when they're in a 
greedy way.

1199
00:52:36,641 --> 00:52:37,830
More interesting.
It's more layered.

1200
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,460
It's like shit.
I heard the video.

1201
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:41,550
The

1202
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:44,990
visuals are incredibly wrong.
Did you read the article on in Gadget?

1203
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,040
No,
this guy told me puts a detailed review 

1204
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,520
of the white sox and red.
It makes so much sense.

1205
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:55,580
Like,
like the director use layers in the 

1206
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:58,251
movie in certain ways to give an effect 
of depth and then the three d comes in 

1207
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:02,310
there and changes what he was doing and 
it's supposedly just does not work.

1208
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:06,360
So it would be cool if you saw it today.
Hey.

1209
00:53:06,361 --> 00:53:07,020
Yeah,
exactly.

1210
00:53:07,021 --> 00:53:12,021
That's what you said.
It wasn't filmed for three d and that's 

1211
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:14,781
what I'm saying.
All of these avatar was avatar was 

1212
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:15,840
burden.
Does Not know his films being filmed for

1213
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:16,400
three days.
No,

1214
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:16,680
no,
no.

1215
00:53:16,681 --> 00:53:19,170
Two.
He did not film it for Three d movie.

1216
00:53:19,171 --> 00:53:24,171
That's what I'm trying to stay.
Avatar was filmed in the regard that 

1217
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:25,850
they filmed it as a two d movie and made
did it for three.

1218
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:26,210
Right.

1219
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,250
Okay.
Oh,

1220
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,350
I don't know.
I'd have to see it.

1221
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:34,980
That's what I'm saying.
All these shit would have to be filmed 

1222
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:34,980
in three d and it's going to take a lot 
of people to go,

1223
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,140
really?
We want to spend his whole movie being a

1224
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:38,700
three d movie,
like jaws,

1225
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:40,890
three d,
they had to go back with your crazy,

1226
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,920
listen to me dummy.
They're gonna do it for every single 

1227
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,051
gigantic explosive and it wouldn't make 
sense to make them much more so I 

1228
00:53:48,051 --> 00:53:51,030
wouldn't make sense for every monster 
movie in Three d,

1229
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:53,880
so they will make way more than two days
and three days.

1230
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,740
Second sales.
Oh No.

1231
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,690
Because I do both doing a ton more,
but you do both at the same time because

1232
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:03,770
just theater just hypes up the sales of 
the two.

1233
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:08,790
They had to rerelease jobs three and non
three d because it didn't do so fucking 

1234
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:13,700
terrible fucking thing came.
It was like there's only like one effect

1235
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:14,550
to.

1236
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:15,930
It was like,
it was so dumb.

1237
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,090
I was like,
one effect the shark coming at you.

1238
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:20,490
It was like such a stupid ass moving.
They're like,

1239
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:23,700
we're not in the ocean.
We got it stopped,

1240
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,830
but that's my bet.
You're what?

1241
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,920
I think three days going to be fail.
What do you think's going to skip 

1242
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:30,920
through them?
What's next?

1243
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,440
Like more better than that kind of 
rejection.

1244
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:36,200
Hologram in your house type shit,
dude.

1245
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,850
I think that's coming to.
I think you're right,

1246
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
but I think until that does come,
this is pretty fucking so it's going to 

1247
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,760
come more where a wall like paper,
LCD technology where this whole wall is 

1248
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,190
going to be like computer,
large size.

1249
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:55,690
This screen.
I don't think it'll ever get to a point 

1250
00:54:55,831 --> 00:55:00,831
where everything is controlled by your 
voice or you think that that's just 

1251
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:03,930
really.
But what about if you don't want to 

1252
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:03,930
talk,
what if it's late at night?

1253
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:06,350
Because my password,
it's like on password xxx.

1254
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:12,100
No,
but yet we'd have another interface or 

1255
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:12,100
keyboard or something.

1256
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:12,100
Keep going.
Yeah.

1257
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:16,510
You just go up to the keyboard.
Will keep be here or do you think 

1258
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:17,740
divorce recognition will get so good 
that be irrelevant?

1259
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,050
I think eventually it will get so good 
at.

1260
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,740
Do you use voice technology at all?
Do you ever use it?

1261
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:27,520
I used it briefly on my android and it 
was amazing.

1262
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:29,240
It was way better than I've ever used 
it.

1263
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:31,940
It was personal.
I keep hearing about that because it's,

1264
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:32,830
it's okay

1265
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,090
with some things.
SoK with blackberry,

1266
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:40,450
blackberry,
you could say like call Brian and it'll 

1267
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:40,450
will call you.
You know,

1268
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:40,490
it's pretty good about that.
Which number?

1269
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,080
Cell calling?

1270
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,140
Yeah,
my car.

1271
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:45,720
It works.
Well,

1272
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,780
that's bad.
In my car I have the Ford.

1273
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,810
Yeah.
And it's like a call Joe.

1274
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:57,270
Well,
but number two,

1275
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,290
but I think that's also the noise of the
road.

1276
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,280
That's why I like a instead of the,
you know that when you do it in a car,

1277
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,590
it's a speakerphone.
It's like talking to Chris.

1278
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,230
So what I always do is I would do it 
straight from the phone.

1279
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,240
So you're talking right into that little
tiny Mc.

1280
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,020
It's pretty direct.
Seems pretty accurate enough.

1281
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,480
You know,
it beats having to press buttons.

1282
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,010
I don't want to press buttons when I'm 
driving.

1283
00:56:20,011 --> 00:56:22,260
It's all come through the Bluetooth so 
them.

1284
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,390
Because that's one of the coolest ever.
You know that you could have a,

1285
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:30,750
you could drive in your car and talked 
to people on the phone with both hands 

1286
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:30,750
on the steering wheel nuts.
Just nuts.

1287
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,650
Did you hear about this company 
overseas?

1288
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:37,660
Uh,
is released in the first jet pack that 

1289
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,761
you can buy.
There's going to be about 500 of them 

1290
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:41,400
being made for that 70,000
each.

1291
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:44,070
So I don't have to go above 30 feet.
I'll go to $200.

1292
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:49,440
Class 30 minutes,
I believe God and time,

1293
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,500
30 minutes.
You'd be bored.

1294
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,260
Already.
Fly.

1295
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:57,290
Fuck that.
Toyota can't even get their jet pack.

1296
00:56:57,291 --> 00:56:59,870
And you only go five feet off the 
ground.

1297
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:05,650
Just keep fucking with whatever freaks 
out and goes 500 feet in the ground and 

1298
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:09,581
you're stuck.
You'd have to have some sort of a 

1299
00:57:09,581 --> 00:57:09,581
parachute,
right?

1300
00:57:09,581 --> 00:57:13,900
Yeah.
Be able to cut the jet pack off to the 

1301
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,160
extra weight.
Imagine we dropped down so much fucking 

1302
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:16,160
head.

1303
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,800
You wouldn't mind.
You mother fucker planned out and just 

1304
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,270
say how many toilets were recalled in 
Japan last night in San Diego?

1305
00:57:23,271 --> 00:57:26,310
Did you hear about it?
And the guy couldn't stop and the police

1306
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,730
got to the side of it was like,
he just gets peers,

1307
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:33,740
like hit the power button up and the guy
was kept on hitting the power button 

1308
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,060
when working was standing on the break.
He said just like full blast.

1309
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:38,960
She'd go in and do and then he put his.
I don't understand it,

1310
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:42,200
but I think it has something to do where
it's just won't let you do anything.

1311
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:47,340
Uh,
and then the cop had to get in front of 

1312
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:47,340
them and I guess in like the,
so,

1313
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:47,540
you know,
kind of break his car.

1314
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:51,360
Oh my God.
I'm guessing that's standard clutch,

1315
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:53,650
you know,
you gotta put it in yourself,

1316
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,380
go down that way.

1317
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:56,570
We have a standard,
even a manual transmission,

1318
00:57:56,571 --> 00:57:58,760
you can always put it into zero and into
neutral.

1319
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,190
But the emergency brake doesn't work.
Yeah.

1320
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:05,220
I don't care how it.
Maybe maybe the computer wouldn't let 

1321
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:05,330
the transmission to switch gears and no 
emergency brake,

1322
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,410
mercy break doesn't.
This was on a broker,

1323
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,960
you know,
so you know,

1324
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:14,070
you would have definitely put that on.
And not to even try.

1325
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:19,140
But I mean,
he say he was standing on his break to 

1326
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,580
George Lucas says that he's found things
that are wrong with the Prius and he 

1327
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,821
says it's a software issue that he can 
duplicate George,

1328
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,730
not George Lucas,
George Lewis,

1329
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:32,800
Wazniak Wazniak with George Lucas.
I lump them all together.

1330
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,090
Roger's Kenny Rogers.

1331
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,120
Anyway,
Steve Wasniak,

1332
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,430
who's one of the super geniuses who 
founded apple,

1333
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:48,670
he has a Prius and he said that there's 
an issue with the accelerator and the 

1334
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:51,920
Incan replicated.
He could do like a specific number of 

1335
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:51,920
things.
You know,

1336
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:51,920
you hit the blinker,
do this,

1337
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,320
do that,
it.

1338
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,400
It'll happen.
And he said he could do it safely and 

1339
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:57,400
shows them how to do it because there's 
a software issue.

1340
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:00,500
That's what's so scary about these 
fucking computer controlled cars,

1341
00:59:00,501 --> 00:59:02,180
man.
Computers Crash.

1342
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:05,330
You know there's some beauty in like an 
old mustang,

1343
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,380
you know,
you turn the fucking key,

1344
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:12,250
the ignition fires up,
the fucking tack is there speedometers.

1345
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:16,070
And you smell the fucking gasoline.
You know what I'm saying?

1346
00:59:16,071 --> 00:59:17,240
There's no.
Nothing happened.

1347
00:59:17,241 --> 00:59:19,460
You out stupid.
You've got drum brakes.

1348
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,170
Okay.
Those bricks suck Dick.

1349
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:26,380
They're terrible.
They don't slowing down there like they 

1350
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:26,380
barely work,
you know,

1351
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:26,720
you got,
you know,

1352
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:31,810
350,
375 fucking American horsepower high 

1353
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,180
torque va,
a nasty sounded exhausting.

1354
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:38,180
You just drive a stick shift four on the
floor.

1355
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,200
Everything that got more advanced,
the more advanced it gets,

1356
00:59:43,201 --> 00:59:48,201
the more your ticket chances.
You've got to fucking software that 

1357
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:52,270
ships break on my breaks to go so bad 
when I was in high school and I'm ready 

1358
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:53,170
to fix on.
It would be at a venture firm.

1359
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,800
Thirty miles an hour.
That all please,

1360
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:59,890
please.
They're just eventually right in front 

1361
00:59:59,890 --> 00:59:59,890
of the car,
in front of you.

1362
00:59:59,890 --> 00:59:59,890
Stopped like,
Oh God,

1363
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,720
this is amazing.
When you were allowed to drive,

1364
01:00:02,721 --> 01:00:05,500
when you're young,
how fucking dumb you and still drive up.

1365
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:10,501
Drive me.
I should be 30 a destroyer machine that 

1366
01:00:10,501 --> 01:00:14,501
could kill people and you're 16.
You're allowed to fucking hammer around 

1367
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:14,501
it.
It's so crazy.

1368
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,520
Yeah.
It's amazing that we're all alive.

1369
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,770
God,
I got a ton of accidents.

1370
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:20,480
No car.
I drove it a retard.

1371
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,320
These cars could not do what I wanted 
them to do.

1372
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,510
It was hitting trees.
Chip,

1373
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:33,440
I mean when I was 16 I was just too way 
too wild to get a driver's license.

1374
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:35,720
There's no way that should have.
I should,

1375
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:40,800
should've been riding the bus,
getting my shit together for at least 

1376
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:40,910
another two years.
By the time I was 18 I had mellowed out,

1377
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,190
gotten used to the fact that I was 
driving around and then I was knew I was

1378
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:47,810
safe when she was 16 and 18.
There's no way.

1379
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:53,680
Yeah.
Drive as fast as you possibly can for 

1380
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:53,680
the 30 yards.
Yeah.

1381
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,070
Retard.
Yeah.

1382
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,120
Just no reason.
Cutting people off

1383
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,340
one reds.
It's scary shit man.

1384
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:07,700
It's scary shit.
All the different automated things that 

1385
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:08,370
are going on today.
So many different things are automated.

1386
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,540
You know what scares the shit out of me 
is these drones they use overseas,

1387
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:18,110
you know when they have these drones 
that fly above Pakistan and launch 

1388
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,970
missiles down because we're not at war,
we're not in Pakistan,

1389
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,500
but there's like,
you know,

1390
01:01:22,501 --> 01:01:24,510
talent wants to get an instead or in 
Pakistan,

1391
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:29,720
so we want to fuck them up.
So we send these robots in space.

1392
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:32,940
I mean this is like fucking.
This is really like science fiction.

1393
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:38,210
We send these flying robots that we 
remotely controlled from a base 

1394
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:41,811
somewhere.
These dudes are literally using xbox 

1395
01:01:41,811 --> 01:01:42,330
controllers because these kids are so 
used to playing xbox.

1396
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:47,331
They know those computers so well.
They just program the software to 

1397
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:47,460
control the drones to use that same 
device.

1398
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:52,570
So we gotta fucking xbox controller and 
they're controlling what is the 

1399
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:52,570
controller goes out.
Well,

1400
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:54,030
anything can happen.
Anything can happen.

1401
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,290
Somebody's house.
Well,

1402
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:58,020
people have died.
A bunch of people that have died.

1403
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,930
A lot of civilian casualties lot.
Yeah,

1404
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,190
just these drones.
I mean,

1405
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:04,050
they're very effective,
but shit,

1406
01:02:04,051 --> 01:02:05,940
man,
you're launching missiles from the sky.

1407
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:07,820
You know who the fuck knows you're 
American?

1408
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:12,290
No,
no.

1409
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,490
He's already understand people getting 
jack loves and right.

1410
01:02:15,491 --> 01:02:18,580
I mean it impacts them as well.
It's a,

1411
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:21,570
it's scary thing.
Now they fired something called Hellfire

1412
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,160
missiles.
Imagine that.

1413
01:02:23,161 --> 01:02:26,890
That's what they named them.
Hell fire know.

1414
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:29,680
Not like freedom maker or something like
that.

1415
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:33,090
You know,
with a bad afterlife.

1416
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:34,080
Yeah.
Not like,

1417
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:39,160
yeah,
I like the strong arm of peace coming 

1418
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,250
from below and you motherfucker hell 
fire.

1419
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:45,840
That doesn't make you feel good.
The whole idea of the whole war.

1420
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:50,841
So crazy.
What's really crazy is that the CIA had 

1421
01:02:50,841 --> 01:02:54,030
the president of Afghanistan,
his brother on his fucking payroll.

1422
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:55,400
Really?
Yeah,

1423
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,260
and this guy is like deepen the poppy 
business.

1424
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:03,440
The CIA was paying him.
It was just recently revealed that the 

1425
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,570
CIA has been paying him for a long time.
He was on the CIA payroll.

1426
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:11,690
He's the brother of the president in 
Afghanistan and he's in the poppy 

1427
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:11,690
business.

1428
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:12,330
I mean,
the whole thing is crazy.

1429
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:16,010
That's 90 something percent of the 
world's heroin from,

1430
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:21,030
from Afghanistan.
Guaran fucking tee,

1431
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:25,140
some evil motherfucker and some high 
lofty position,

1432
01:03:25,141 --> 01:03:30,141
you know,
I want to name the organization because 

1433
01:03:30,141 --> 01:03:31,140
who the fuck knows is really bringing it
in even if it isn't even has a name,

1434
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:34,980
but those guys are profiting off that.
Distributors for sure.

1435
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:36,930
It's been proven many,
many times.

1436
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,130
You know,
there's a plane that the CIA had,

1437
01:03:39,131 --> 01:03:41,400
and we talked about this before on the 
show with this plane,

1438
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:44,940
had crashed in Mexico with four tons of 
cocaine in it,

1439
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:47,730
and it was a jet that had been to 
Guantanamo Bay twice.

1440
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,340
It was a CIA.
Jack is fucking jet,

1441
01:03:50,341 --> 01:03:53,100
had been to one time obey on two 
separate occasions.

1442
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:58,250
And this fucking thing was flying 
cocaine into the United States and 

1443
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,850
crashed in Mexico for tons of coke,
man.

1444
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:06,060
Hmm.
So many different stories about if you 

1445
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,541
want to,
if you want to look any of this stuff 

1446
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:08,541
online,
look up that,

1447
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:10,410
that playing the crash.
Then look up the story of Barry Seal's.

1448
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:13,410
Barry Seal's was a guy who was a,
uh,

1449
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:18,560
a drug runner who would fly drugs in 
from South America to the United States 

1450
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:22,551
and drop them off in Mena,
Arkansas in a little plane and he would 

1451
01:04:22,551 --> 01:04:25,971
drop a parachute.
Will these two kids saw the dropoff one 

1452
01:04:25,971 --> 01:04:28,911
day?
And they caught the kids because they 

1453
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:28,911
didn't want the kids telling they killed
them.

1454
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:33,020
And their parents found out that it was 
a murder because the cops had said that 

1455
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,240
they found these kids on the train 
tracks apparently,

1456
01:04:34,241 --> 01:04:36,930
that they placed their bodies,
but travels went over and they said,

1457
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,270
oh,
they got stoned and they laid out on the

1458
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:44,271
train tracks and the parents did.
Autopsies hadn't had an autopsy found.

1459
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,010
They found knife wounds.
The kids had been stabbed.

1460
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,380
So they stabbed these kids and killed 
them.

1461
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,680
And then they laid him on the tracks.
And so then it became this gigantic 

1462
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:54,680
investigation who was flying,
blah,

1463
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,170
blah,
blah.

1464
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,300
They get ahold of this guy,
Barry Seals and bearings.

1465
01:04:57,301 --> 01:05:00,450
Seals is totally spills the beans,
tells the whole story.

1466
01:05:00,451 --> 01:05:02,390
All the different shit that he did,
he's ready to testify,

1467
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:04,530
goes to court and they fucking 
assassinate him.

1468
01:05:04,531 --> 01:05:05,370
Literally,
I was waiting.

1469
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:08,460
So this dude's eyes weighted court.
He's got George Bush,

1470
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:14,090
George Bush,
his phone number in his pocket at the 

1471
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:14,490
time and he gets murdered in his car on 
the way to talk about it.

1472
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,890
And this was the guy that was an 
employee of the CIA.

1473
01:05:16,891 --> 01:05:18,610
And there's,
there's not just those,

1474
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:21,700
because a bunch of them,
Michael Rupert is a guy who wrote a book

1475
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:26,701
about it.
He was an lapd detective and something 

1476
01:05:26,701 --> 01:05:26,701
in Lapd.

1477
01:05:26,701 --> 01:05:26,701
I don't want to,
I don't know what he was,

1478
01:05:26,701 --> 01:05:30,490
but he busted the CIA selling drugs and 
he's like,

1479
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:33,310
and he was told to the back off the case
and he's like,

1480
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:36,100
this is fucking insane.
And he's written books about it.

1481
01:05:36,101 --> 01:05:38,460
He's got this website from the 
wilderness.com,

1482
01:05:38,461 --> 01:05:39,540
I believe it is.
You know,

1483
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:41,050
it's all,
all detailing,

1484
01:05:41,051 --> 01:05:46,051
all the different corruption that.
And they're doing it right in front 

1485
01:05:46,051 --> 01:05:46,051
everybody's fucking face.
That's the crazy thing.

1486
01:05:46,051 --> 01:05:48,250
I mean,
think about how much God damn cocaine is

1487
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:53,251
in this country.
It's not all coming in because of 

1488
01:05:53,251 --> 01:05:53,251
retarded criminals.
Because most people that are struggling,

1489
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:58,360
a huge organizations and the compliments
the government has to do with it for 

1490
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:01,300
sure.
Someone and some some aspect.

1491
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,230
Why wouldn't they?
If these are,

1492
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,200
if these people want to do drugs,
you know,

1493
01:06:05,201 --> 01:06:07,720
what the fuck?
Let's who's making money off the drugs.

1494
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:08,710
They probably feel like,
look,

1495
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,740
the bad guy's going to make money off of
drugs anyway.

1496
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:12,490
Let's just cut them out.
We'll take the money.

1497
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,650
Fucking drugs are going to be out there 
no matter what you do,

1498
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:17,830
and it's all like a nice little cycle 
because the more people get arrested for

1499
01:06:17,831 --> 01:06:22,831
those drugs to more of the prison 
private prison companies and companies 

1500
01:06:22,831 --> 01:06:26,551
that own these gigantic prisons,
the more they're happy because more 

1501
01:06:26,551 --> 01:06:26,740
people are in the prisons and the more 
people that are in private prisons,

1502
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:29,590
the more profit they make.
So they support are the shit.

1503
01:06:29,591 --> 01:06:31,480
So they actually support drugs being 
illegal.

1504
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,060
They want them to be illegal.
They pushed for it.

1505
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:36,280
It's fucking crazy.
The whole,

1506
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:41,310
the whole big package is fucking crazy.
And the idea that the government is 

1507
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:42,010
behind it all,
if there's evidence of it just makes the

1508
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:42,850
whole thing mindblowing.

1509
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:46,150
It's just so nuts.
The fact that the BDA,

1510
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:49,630
you know,
is like in cahoots with the CIA and they

1511
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:54,631
all.
It's all like a big game at the very 

1512
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:54,631
top.
It's all horseshit.

1513
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:56,590
So I'll just profit and money.
How much fucking money save in Macon?

1514
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,550
Oh,
he must be so much money in drugs.

1515
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,170
Who gets the money?
I don't know.

1516
01:07:02,171 --> 01:07:03,220
That's a good question.
Right?

1517
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:08,640
That's a good question.
How many people are involved and where 

1518
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:08,640
does it go?
I mean,

1519
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:08,640
if the CIA,
if someone in the CIA,

1520
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,300
someone in the organization really is 
selling drugs.

1521
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:15,510
Is it just every now and then or a rogue
agent goes fucking nutty and cut some 

1522
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:19,450
deal with some fucking killer.
Do you think it's all the time?

1523
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,920
If that's how it gets in the country?
Well,

1524
01:07:20,921 --> 01:07:21,490
if.
Yeah,

1525
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,180
I mean,
how many times has it happened?

1526
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:29,220
I mean,
how much cocaine did we have already 

1527
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:29,220
here?

1528
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:29,220
How long does cocaine last?
You know,

1529
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:30,490
if you bring in a whole gigantic ship 
full of it,

1530
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:35,820
where would you keep it?
How long does it take to get it on the 

1531
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:35,820
street?
Someone's bringing it in.

1532
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:35,990
It's not these morons.
It's not.

1533
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,820
They'd be getting busted left and right.
People that are so crazy,

1534
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,720
they're willing to do something that 
insane.

1535
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:42,880
Like some Mongo,
a million dollars for the cocaine in the

1536
01:07:42,881 --> 01:07:46,480
country because people are crazy.
Those people get busted doing shit.

1537
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:51,510
That's not an option that part of like 
they hire somebody to transport.

1538
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:53,840
The more people you hire,
the more people are going to kill you.

1539
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:59,540
The more people you hire,
the the worst year idea is because the 

1540
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:00,460
more people that can get busted and wear
a wire and put you in jail,

1541
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,740
it's very dangerous.
The smart move to do.

1542
01:08:02,741 --> 01:08:05,290
If you're doing something to hire as few
people as possible,

1543
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,470
take your own ship over somewhere.

1544
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,730
It might be a way to do it.
Might be the way to do it.

1545
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:11,440
You might have to bring your own ship.
No Way.

1546
01:08:11,441 --> 01:08:14,530
Some cartel guy transport to know.
Those guys don't do it.

1547
01:08:14,531 --> 01:08:15,380
They hire other guys,
do it.

1548
01:08:15,381 --> 01:08:20,381
That's why they was living these fucking
gigantic compounds with 15 dogs and had 

1549
01:08:20,381 --> 01:08:22,130
guns and no fucking nuts,
man.

1550
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:25,070
Imagine that life in Mexico,
they've gone crazy.

1551
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,980
The Mexican drug war is just off the 
fucking chain.

1552
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:30,590
When we talked to victor about it,
you know the dude,

1553
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:36,620
he just got out our guide from the UFC 
who does a Spanish commentary.

1554
01:08:36,621 --> 01:08:38,930
He does my job.
He just got out of Juarez.

1555
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:44,500
He was living in Juarez.
That's what he says every time it's a 

1556
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:44,500
knockout.
Yeah.

1557
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,860
Does he?
Oh,

1558
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,910
alright.
So I should have let that go.

1559
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,750
That was my biggest regret is that 
you're not telling everyone.

1560
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,040
Now you know,
Victor says this.

1561
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,960
That's the lyric.
Because I thought he did.

1562
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:04,970
That was just saying because Michael k 
one commentary and he goes really big 

1563
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,050
commercial.
The guy gets cracked.

1564
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,430
Yeah.
That's funny.

1565
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,240
Yeah,
he's awesome.

1566
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,050
He's hilarious.

1567
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:13,490
Convention.

1568
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:15,820
He says crazy shit

1569
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:17,600
all times

1570
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:20,910
that says,
oh yeah,

1571
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:23,010
yeah.
They let them just do whatever they want

1572
01:09:23,011 --> 01:09:23,910
it.
The people love it.

1573
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,840
I think he's hilarious.
He's my favorite guy to listen to him.

1574
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:34,310
He's a man.
We hung out with them and I know that 

1575
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:38,050
somewhere in Canada and Edmonton.
Then we hung out with him and his 

1576
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,270
girlfriend again in Australia.
Super Cool.

1577
01:09:39,271 --> 01:09:40,830
Dude.
Couldn't be nicer.

1578
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:41,970
So he's Australian.

1579
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,370
More hooks than a pirate connection.
That's my favorite one.

1580
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,500
Pirated.

1581
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:55,450
My name is mom borrowed.
How can we not hear about the fucking 

1582
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:59,030
Somalian pirates anymore?
They got canceled.

1583
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:04,090
We've got bored of escape.
There's two people ever escaped that 

1584
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:04,820
girl.
English couples still fucked.

1585
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:05,450
Oh really?
Yeah,

1586
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:08,390
they still got those bitches ain't 
locked up and kidnapped him.

1587
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:11,900
They want millions.
They know these guys are worth millions.

1588
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:13,970
Who knows what they're doing to them 
until they're probably fucking them.

1589
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:19,410
They've been there.
Were surprisingly good about once you 

1590
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:19,410
pay the money to get everything that's 
said,

1591
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:23,800
but what do they do now?
These people aren't coughing up the 

1592
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:23,800
money.
I bet they're fucking them.

1593
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,140
They might.
Why not?

1594
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:26,210
Why wouldn't they fuck them?
These pretty white people.

1595
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:29,150
Silky smooth.
White skin worth billions.

1596
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,780
These cats are like super,
super rich.

1597
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:35,870
Want her there?
Or do they just like regular folks who 

1598
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:37,610
did the people that were kidnapped on 
the yacht,

1599
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,910
like the guy and the girl and they were 
like real travelers.

1600
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,440
That's so scary.
I was attending about it.

1601
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:51,610
We are in 2010 and this is the Internet.
So we're gonna find out because I think 

1602
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:54,320
that's fucking interesting because 
that's one of the things about traveling

1603
01:10:54,321 --> 01:10:56,730
is that um,
the,

1604
01:10:57,310 --> 01:11:01,010
it gets fucking nerve wracking thinking 
about what is safe and what is not.

1605
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:03,250
And all these losses of countries don't 
have overload.

1606
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:07,440
Yeah.
When I was in Brazil,

1607
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:13,870
that scared the shit out of me from us 
to Brazil was A.

1608
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,070
Brazil was very much like a Sao Paulo.
It was,

1609
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:19,200
um,
there was a feeling in the air like,

1610
01:11:19,201 --> 01:11:20,310
yeah,
you gotTa Watch where you go.

1611
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,010
Most of the people were very nice,
very friendly,

1612
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:25,170
a lot of beautiful houses,
a lot of Nice neighborhoods,

1613
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:30,470
but it was also like they are.
I'm sure if you go to the market and 

1614
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:30,870
it's been Jerusalem,
you're welcome to the airport.

1615
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:36,370
People are don't.
While someone from the navy witnessed 

1616
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:36,420
it,
snapped British yachtsman oh,

1617
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:37,980
he's a yachtsman.
Wow.

1618
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:43,750
Is this passing ship?
Do you want what?

1619
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:47,660
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1620
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,680
She's pasty white.
Now she's just,

1621
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:53,620
she's pacing white.
Their pasty,

1622
01:11:53,621 --> 01:11:54,970
white,
rich English people.

1623
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:58,020
Oh my God.
They must have fucked shit.

1624
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,710
Nothing.
Fucking people.

1625
01:12:00,711 --> 01:12:04,390
And these guys are nuts.
They went from Turkey through Africa,

1626
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,370
down through Saudi Arabia to some Samira
love.

1627
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,740
So far off the twitter.
I'll put the link up.

1628
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:16,400
Pirates versus Ninjas.
Who would you choose?

1629
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:22,220
The parents this longer than.
Where's the ocean or last names is 

1630
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:31,220
always the immediate answer for why.
How are they going to take the ocean?

1631
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:36,250
They don't want both and then just says 
why it's better because when you're an 

1632
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:39,761
injury,
you know for sure you can kicked up a 

1633
01:12:39,761 --> 01:12:39,761
house.
Yeah,

1634
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:47,220
no one's a.
You make a movie where it's like a 

1635
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:47,220
Ninja.
He's tired.

1636
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:52,220
Your fucking 12 it probably 12 year old 
boy son.

1637
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:58,300
Like he takes off his mask and he has 
like a little eyepatch under his mask 

1638
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,140
and there's like a squished like,

1639
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:07,180
okay,
these people have not paid yet.

1640
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:08,800
The pirates believe these people are 
wealthy.

1641
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:12,480
That's what it is and not well things 
they put in their yacht.

1642
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:15,640
All their money they put into the yacht.
Wow,

1643
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:19,360
these guys are fucked.
Wow.

1644
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:23,380
This is scary shit man.
They went nutty man.

1645
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:27,910
These people sailed all the way down to 
fucking Somalia.

1646
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:33,390
What the Suez Canal went to move by.
They want to cross the ocean to India 

1647
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:38,430
and then they went all the way back 
towards Tanzania and that's where they 

1648
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:39,790
got jacked.
There's some dream of sailing around the

1649
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:41,470
world,
retiring the center of the world.

1650
01:13:41,471 --> 01:13:42,430
Parents did that,
you know,

1651
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:46,310
my parents went to the Florida keys and 
then up in the Bahamas for awhile,

1652
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:48,100
you know,
but it's nerve wracking,

1653
01:13:48,101 --> 01:13:53,101
man.
You're living in a fucking boat out in 

1654
01:13:53,101 --> 01:13:53,101
the water and you know when the storms 
come,

1655
01:13:53,101 --> 01:13:55,210
you're fucking houses literally flopping
back and forth and it,

1656
01:13:55,211 --> 01:13:57,760
Michael under other houses are going to 
crash into it.

1657
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:02,500
My Dad had to get up in the middle of 
the night and go out to in the middle of

1658
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,380
horrible rough waters,
climb on other people's boats and secure

1659
01:14:05,381 --> 01:14:10,381
their anchors because they didn't secure
their anchor correctly and their boats 

1660
01:14:10,381 --> 01:14:13,231
were drifting and they had to worry 
about their boats slamming into it as 

1661
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:13,231
really.
Yeah,

1662
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:16,930
it's dangerous shit.
And they had a little bit of a little 

1663
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:18,720
sailboat.
They lived on a little sailboat for a 

1664
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,450
couple of years putting daddy shit,
man.

1665
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,030
What up?
Anyway,

1666
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,880
what I'm trying to say is you go to 
other places,

1667
01:14:21,881 --> 01:14:22,930
you realize like,
God damn,

1668
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:24,370
we're lucky it's safe here.
You know,

1669
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,850
because I take flights,
human beings are.

1670
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:31,900
We are only as civilized as our 
circumstances,

1671
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:37,170
you know,
and I learned that when we were in San 

1672
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:37,170
Francisco and the fucking,
we thought the building was on fire,

1673
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:37,920
you know,
I,

1674
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:40,660
I was really thinking like,
how am I going to do this?

1675
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:45,660
Well,
when we're evacuating it was 15 flights 

1676
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:47,881
of stairs and people were going down the
stairs in single file and people were 

1677
01:14:47,881 --> 01:14:47,890
panicking and they were asking 
questions.

1678
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:52,891
They were stopping the line and they 
were going really slow and they were 

1679
01:14:52,891 --> 01:14:52,891
shitting their pants and while this is 
all happening,

1680
01:14:52,891 --> 01:14:57,870
you could look down through the spirals 
and see the smoke coming up from the 

1681
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:59,800
bottom and I was ready to jump.
I was ready to just start climbing down.

1682
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:01,150
I was ready to just start,
fuck you.

1683
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:06,270
I'm just going to start climbing you.
People are panicking and they're not 

1684
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:06,270
going fast enough.
They're there.

1685
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:09,420
They're like freaking out and everyone's
and every floor they're merging.

1686
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:11,710
You start thinking like,
this is how someone could die.

1687
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:14,710
You can die like this.
You can get stuck in a fucking fire.

1688
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:15,880
Man.
This is scary shit.

1689
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,160
Very,
very scary shit.

1690
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:18,760
Yeah,
that,

1691
01:15:18,761 --> 01:15:23,761
that,
that really freaked me out and I now I 

1692
01:15:23,761 --> 01:15:27,011
hate going to,
I used to like to be at the top floor 

1693
01:15:27,011 --> 01:15:27,011
for some reason I guess high as I can 
get,

1694
01:15:27,011 --> 01:15:31,320
like when I go to a hotel second floor 
we get because of that,

1695
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:34,460
you know that that was one of the worst 
times in my life.

1696
01:15:34,461 --> 01:15:37,880
That's the only time ever I thought I 
would for sure was going to die

1697
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,910
don,
but I thought we were in a very,

1698
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:45,911
very bad situation here.
I was very thankful when we got out and 

1699
01:15:45,911 --> 01:15:46,970
everything was okay and it turned out it
wasn't really a fire under the smoke was

1700
01:15:46,971 --> 01:15:49,640
actually the fire extinguishers because 
he's assholes.

1701
01:15:49,641 --> 01:15:52,060
Got Drunk and like 4:30
in the morning just started spring.

1702
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,510
You know who's saying that it was him 
that's bringing this show.

1703
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:01,600
It probably was so dare you who?
But it was a whole fucking room.

1704
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,700
The whole floor was covered in this 
smoke and the fire alarms went off,

1705
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,790
I guess because they activated the a 
thing,

1706
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:13,680
so it was no real fire,
but God damn was scary as fuck and could

1707
01:16:13,681 --> 01:16:16,700
have very easily been a fire.
It's terrifying.

1708
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,640
Shit.
Good energy can just overcome,

1709
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:22,640
you know,
because one of those old ass buildings,

1710
01:16:22,641 --> 01:16:25,070
they're not safe man.
Single fire staircases.

1711
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:26,520
Oh,
that was awful.

1712
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:29,170
They could suck it.
12 floors going into one.

1713
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:33,540
I was on the floor is going into one 
staircase and I think it was other ones,

1714
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:35,100
but they were like hidden staircase.

1715
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:38,190
There was so many people that were 
walking so slowly we're panicking.

1716
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:43,310
Oh.
They had just woken up and they were 

1717
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:43,310
delirious and they were unhealthy and 
they weren't athletic.

1718
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:44,850
They weren't like people who can move 
well,

1719
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,420
so he'll get up and some people need a 
long ass fucking time to get going.

1720
01:16:48,421 --> 01:16:53,421
Like they're in their sixties and 
seventies and all of a sudden you put 

1721
01:16:53,421 --> 01:16:53,421
them on a staircase is like,
oh my God,

1722
01:16:53,421 --> 01:16:53,421
I'm going to die because this guy can't 
walk.

1723
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,020
If you got to walk faster,
buddy,

1724
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:55,860
you gotta walk.
There's,

1725
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:57,720
there's a gap in front of you,
motherfucker,

1726
01:16:57,810 --> 01:16:59,990
you know when you normally there's a gap
on the stairs,

1727
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:04,991
it doesn't mean shit,
but when you see smoke on the second 

1728
01:17:04,991 --> 01:17:04,991
floor and there's like,
you know,

1729
01:17:04,991 --> 01:17:05,910
10 feet between you and then the next 
guy like,

1730
01:17:05,911 --> 01:17:07,260
dude,
you gotta move man,

1731
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:09,770
what are you doing in my cap?
Attacking Brian,

1732
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:15,840
playing with it.
You put a sleeve over as a or she 

1733
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:15,840
scratched it up.
Can't play.

1734
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,180
You can't rub her belly.
She likes to fight.

1735
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,810
We'll be right back.
Ladies and gentlemen.

1736
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:26,080
Now we're going to go to your emails and
calls and calls.

1737
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:27,880
Eventually.
What are we going to do?

1738
01:17:27,881 --> 01:17:29,550
A skype thing.
Zoom,

1739
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:30,730
skype.

1740
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,360
No,
don't do it right now.

1741
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,490
Fucking Johnny Depp.
Live.

1742
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:43,930
Pirate.
We are already likes the pirates.

1743
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:58,820
That's why I bring a collection of 
sheets just in case I need to tie them 

1744
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:01,561
together and dip.
I don't think I wasn't thinking about 

1745
01:18:01,561 --> 01:18:03,841
it.
And the lower I got the more I was 

1746
01:18:03,841 --> 01:18:03,841
thinking,
okay,

1747
01:18:03,841 --> 01:18:04,300
maybe I can jump out from here and live.
They've got to jump around from here.

1748
01:18:04,301 --> 01:18:07,450
And then you start thinking crazy shit.
You know,

1749
01:18:07,451 --> 01:18:08,010
your,
your,

1750
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,630
your survival instincts,
you really become an animal.

1751
01:18:10,631 --> 01:18:12,490
You become an organism that's trying to 
survive.

1752
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:17,550
You know,
you don't really think about anything 

1753
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:17,550
else.

1754
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:17,550
That's why this end of the road shit's 
crazy when the zombies come and shit,

1755
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:20,100
because I'm going to be like the first 
one that I eat,

1756
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:22,980
the heart.
You know that somebody in our group.

1757
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,310
Why do you think that I have.
No,

1758
01:18:26,311 --> 01:18:28,910
I'm just kidding.
But I think zombies.

1759
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,450
We've talked about this before.
I think this whole idea of reincarnating

1760
01:18:32,451 --> 01:18:34,460
people after they're dead,
you know,

1761
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:37,330
like the whole cryogenics thing where 
they're taking people into freezing.

1762
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:40,370
I'm like they did with Walt Disney.
I think if there are really zombies,

1763
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:42,920
that's a Zombie.
The Zombie is when a person dies,

1764
01:18:42,921 --> 01:18:44,960
their soul goes the next stage of 
existence,

1765
01:18:44,961 --> 01:18:46,910
their energy,
their essence can you just read,

1766
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:49,340
make their flesh and the flesh needs to 
stay alive,

1767
01:18:49,341 --> 01:18:51,470
but it doesn't think at all.
It's just moving on.

1768
01:18:51,471 --> 01:18:56,471
Instead of trying to keep things in 
front of it and try and bite your army 

1769
01:18:56,471 --> 01:18:56,471
it because it's hungry.

1770
01:18:56,471 --> 01:19:00,230
Remember that old experiment with the 
dog where they brought dogs back to 

1771
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:00,230
life.
You ever see that?

1772
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:02,130
Just the Russian film.
What is that?

1773
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,010
Oh,
you got to look that up on Google there.

1774
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:09,150
They have like this head of a dog and 
they hook it up to these chemicals and 

1775
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:12,420
the dog just starts coming back to life.
Starts Licking his lips.

1776
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:15,150
What was it?
Russian Russian scientists.

1777
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,520
Scientists.
Dog Dead,

1778
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,000
but giant Black Madonna.
Lack resilience.

1779
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,150
I rushed in sciences.
Dead Dogs.

1780
01:19:24,151 --> 01:19:25,790
Severed head alive.
Did.

1781
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:30,791
That is one of the creepiest videos I 
ever saw and that's probably something 

1782
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:30,791
like that.
Zombie dog right there.

1783
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:32,220
That's,
that's a Zombie dog that kept alive with

1784
01:19:32,221 --> 01:19:37,221
electrical stimulation.
I'm imagining like if they made it a 

1785
01:19:37,221 --> 01:19:39,921
thing that they could just put a collar 
on its neck to do the same thing like a 

1786
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:41,070
executive or write things,
I can control it.

1787
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,340
Well,
I think for sure.

1788
01:19:43,341 --> 01:19:45,380
You know,
one of the things that those people.

1789
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:46,530
Here's the video.
Wow,

1790
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,260
that's the dog.
Oh my God.

1791
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:50,150
Zombie.
Oh my God.

1792
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:55,540
Is there a video?
I'm going to put it on twitter first so 

1793
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,761
we can all watch together.
Jimmy Kimmel,

1794
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,350
you either watch him,
you know it was the best name.

1795
01:20:20,351 --> 01:20:25,351
That thing that he did with with him 
when he came up as and this whole show 

1796
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:29,110
is to do that.
Things work and you tweet it.

1797
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:31,540
That's a cartoon.
That's real.

1798
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:32,490
He's just explaining it,

1799
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:39,230
explaining how he definitely was feeding
the dog.

1800
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:51,310
This is just a mad scientist shit.
They're trying to figure out what makes 

1801
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:53,450
flesh and tissue alive and this dog,
they're feeding blood.

1802
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,900
This dog's head while this fucking dogs 
head is severed.

1803
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,110
I mean this is.
They're explaining it in a cartoon form,

1804
01:21:00,111 --> 01:21:01,790
but then watched the do it is

1805
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:12,140
freaky.

1806
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:16,860
That's insane.
We kept.

1807
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:19,140
That dog's a alive for hours.
It's moving around.

1808
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,520
It's reacting.
When he tickles his nose.

1809
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:27,320
Can't park has been a voicebox.
It's got an old lungs man or he's got 

1810
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:27,320
nothing.
It's,

1811
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:30,440
it's saying citric acid.
He's taking citric acid and when you get

1812
01:21:30,441 --> 01:21:31,290
to put her eyes,
nose,

1813
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:36,290
can you imagine doing that to like your 
old pet because you want to make alive.

1814
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:41,860
I'm looking at that is insane.
The dog's head is completely removed 

1815
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:43,440
from his body and it's licking its 
knows.

1816
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:45,240
The guy covered its nose with citric 
acid.

1817
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:50,470
So like here,
it's a cute dog is looking at those why 

1818
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:52,150
they have to chop his fucking head off.
So did they.

1819
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:53,800
Just to figure out that you can do it.

1820
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:59,240
It's blinking.
Oh my God.

1821
01:21:59,241 --> 01:22:00,110
They put light on it.

1822
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:03,360
Oh dog sound.
Sound that I picked up a hammer.

1823
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:09,820
Smash his face.
Know the ground with a hammer.

1824
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:14,330
You watch a video.
Always reacting to that.

1825
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:15,810
He's trying to get away from the hammer 
noise.

1826
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:17,400
Oh my God.
It's so crazy.

1827
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:22,440
Now,
did they cut his head off and put it 

1828
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:22,440
right on that machine already?
Chopped his fucking head off.

1829
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,140
They didn't bring it back to life.
Don't kill them.

1830
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:30,141
Don't know exactly how long it was,
but this crazy guy did a bunch of these 

1831
01:22:30,141 --> 01:22:30,750
kinds of experiments.
Fuck,

1832
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:32,930
that's so scary.
It's like,

1833
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,420
are you guys willing to do something 
that that dark.

1834
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:41,900
I mean,
I understand it's all for the name of 

1835
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,221
science and all that stuff,
but the guy who's willing to take an 

1836
01:22:43,221 --> 01:22:45,231
animal and completely disregarded 
suffering just to find out what you can 

1837
01:22:45,231 --> 01:22:45,960
do to it,
that guy will do that to people.

1838
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:48,220
That's what I think.
I mean,

1839
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,220
maybe not elaborate.
It's where's the line?

1840
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:55,210
What is the line when you want to take.
There was a guy who,

1841
01:22:55,211 --> 01:22:57,300
uh,
who recently got arrested.

1842
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,410
I want to be in charge of choosing been 
sent,

1843
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:04,460
being sentenced right now.
He was on a dating game back in the 

1844
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:06,030
seventies and this chick turned them 
down and I'll find that to the,

1845
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:11,220
turned him down.
And after the CIC turned him down 

1846
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:11,220
because of the chip,
didn't want to go out with him.

1847
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:11,220
Well,
it turned out he,

1848
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:13,660
before he was even on the show in 1968,
he had already raped a child.

1849
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,270
He raped a 12 year old girl and they 
didn't know about it.

1850
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:21,420
So he gets on the show.
He went and the girl doesn't want to 

1851
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:22,110
date them.
The girl doesn't want to date him,

1852
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:24,790
so he goes on a fucking killing spree.

1853
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,770
Killer.
No he doesn't,

1854
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:29,650
but he kills a child.
He kills a,

1855
01:23:29,651 --> 01:23:34,651
I think for people.
Took one teenage girl out into the 

1856
01:23:34,651 --> 01:23:37,831
woods,
sodomized her and smashed her fucking 

1857
01:23:37,831 --> 01:23:37,831
head with a rock.
I mean,

1858
01:23:37,831 --> 01:23:37,831
he did some horrible,
horrible shit.

1859
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:40,090
He's moving people.
Fuck.

1860
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,150
And um,
I mean,

1861
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:45,430
that guy.
Let's do cut his fucking head off.

1862
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:47,380
You know what I'm saying?
You guys killed four people.

1863
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,300
Raves and sodomized and check hills with
the rock.

1864
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,920
Let's cut his head off.
Why are we kidding?

1865
01:23:50,921 --> 01:23:52,690
This dog didn't do shit.
You know,

1866
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,300
that guy is the one passion number one 
will fucking kill you.

1867
01:23:55,301 --> 01:23:56,500
That's what it is.
This is the guy.

1868
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,920
This is him in court right now.
We gotta wait older.

1869
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:01,270
Well,
this is 1978,

1870
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:08,020
but he went on a fucking killing spree.
He raped her with a claw hammer so he 

1871
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:13,050
repeatedly,
all of them will repeatedly strangled 

1872
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:14,440
and then resuscitated during their desk 
to prolong their agony.

1873
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:18,250
So come up again.
He's just an evil evil.

1874
01:24:18,251 --> 01:24:19,630
Fuck yeah,
she was hot and smart.

1875
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,080
She smartened up you may 19,
78.

1876
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:24,010
She knew that the other dudes who were 
on the show with him,

1877
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,870
he said that he was so creepy.
They were like,

1878
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:30,960
I didn't even realize it,
but they were leaning away from him and 

1879
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,831
they said they didn't elect the locker 
room like it was the dresser in the 

1880
01:24:34,831 --> 01:24:34,831
green room.
It wasn't like all jokes like,

1881
01:24:34,831 --> 01:24:39,571
hey,
we're on this crazy TV shows like I'm 

1882
01:24:39,571 --> 01:24:39,571
going to win you fucking piece of shit.
It's fucking show.

1883
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:41,620
Like he was like aggressive with them 
and like crazy.

1884
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:44,770
Like this guy's fucking creepy.
It turns out he's a serial killer.

1885
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:49,890
You know that guy.
We should experiment on that 

1886
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:49,890
motherfucker.
Right?

1887
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:49,890
And that's the guy who should be 
telling.

1888
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:51,350
Not it got dumped on,
but entrepreneur,

1889
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:55,260
I want to sit with them asking me 
questions.

1890
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:55,990
I know,
right?

1891
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,560
He's the defense to Oh,
even better.

1892
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:01,600
And I wonder how they caught him.
I don't know the whole story.

1893
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:05,130
I don't know how to go look at him.
And what a creepy fuck.

1894
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:09,520
There's people that enjoy,
they truly enjoy hurting other people.

1895
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:10,230
You know,
they're,

1896
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:15,240
they're broken.
Their wires are just completely crossed 

1897
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:15,240
and they actually enjoy it.
Man,

1898
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:19,681
that's fucked up.
But talking about medicine and how we 

1899
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:20,480
tried it for the monkeys,
did he really big garden that would have

1900
01:25:20,481 --> 01:25:25,481
still gotten crazy,
would have been a crazy monkey way more 

1901
01:25:25,481 --> 01:25:29,821
crazy because what if he became one of 
the monkeys and he got fucking famous 

1902
01:25:29,821 --> 01:25:31,480
and they had incredible power.
I mean the power he had over checks.

1903
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,890
He was three feet tall and fucking ex 
con and it was all over.

1904
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:40,480
You always have hot checks around them 
so everyone in Hollywood and putting 

1905
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,171
them over and don't think dudes don't do
plants get suppose because there's 

1906
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:45,580
always guys that are like in Vegas,
especially that party.

1907
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:48,110
They'll say we get a lot of hot chicks 
with us going down there.

1908
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,650
They were always trying to talk to like 
UFC guys and fighters.

1909
01:25:50,651 --> 01:25:55,651
Like why you?
Why are you telling guys you have a lot 

1910
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:58,291
of hot chicks with you?
If you have a lot of hot chicks with 

1911
01:25:58,291 --> 01:26:00,421
you,
like are you like just a really super 

1912
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:02,341
cool guy and wants to make everybody 
happy or they're just trying to make 

1913
01:26:02,341 --> 01:26:02,590
friends with everybody and this is like 
the bait you're throwing out there to.

1914
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:03,390
Yeah,
it,

1915
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:04,220
it was weird.

1916
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,110
That's all right.
That's Manson Shit.

1917
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,780
The problem is always going to have a 
lot of hot chicks and you're like,

1918
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:12,340
what am I going to do with that scary 
shit?

1919
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:13,770
Meet them.
Yeah.

1920
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:14,690
Yeah,
exactly.

1921
01:26:14,691 --> 01:26:17,060
Well the prostitutes that are willing to
have sex with me or something.

1922
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:18,540
The other ones,
like what do you understand?

1923
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:20,310
Do you want to talk about your,
uh,

1924
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:24,620
your last talks to anything I went on 
last comic standing against it.

1925
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:29,610
What do you mean been talking about?
You mean by rules of like NBC?

1926
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,610
I have no idea.
I'm sure you're allowed.

1927
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,210
And then I get there and they said this 
year they want to do,

1928
01:26:37,211 --> 01:26:38,140
um,
what's it called?

1929
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:41,220
A more respectable uh,
judges because they're afraid of aunt,

1930
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,640
uh,
uh,

1931
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,410
that level of comic where they were 
like,

1932
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:47,710
oh,
people don't really want to do it.

1933
01:26:47,711 --> 01:26:52,711
So they got Greg Giraldo and Andy 
kindler arrives back and then at the 

1934
01:26:52,711 --> 01:26:52,990
last minute I found out before I got 
there,

1935
01:26:52,991 --> 01:26:54,870
I went on that my ex girlfriend Natasha,

1936
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:59,940
what are the experts,
but now this is not just an ex 

1937
01:26:59,940 --> 01:26:59,940
girlfriend,
but there's a,

1938
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:03,520
there's a big ass story to it.
And one of them is that at one point in 

1939
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,750
time was quite upset with her already.

1940
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:06,750
Uh,
yes.

1941
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:07,650
And uh.
Oh,

1942
01:27:07,651 --> 01:27:09,060
the water.
Yeah.

1943
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:10,170
Yeah,
she uh,

1944
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,080
she left me for some guy and mad tv and 
then um,

1945
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:16,740
and then she started hanging around a 
lot my safety spot,

1946
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:19,380
my clubhouse and making it uncomfortable
for me.

1947
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:21,100
And then,
uh,

1948
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:26,180
she started dating my friend and then 
she was hanging around the club house 

1949
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:26,180
again.
I threw water on her face,

1950
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:30,560
so not the best judge you'd be online,
not the one I want to be up.

1951
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:32,830
And then they started grilling me about 
it,

1952
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:38,330
like right before I go on and Cameron 
asked me this question before and I'm 

1953
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:38,330
like,
dancing,

1954
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:40,330
what?
Absolutely thought about it,

1955
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,100
but I'd love to cuddle situation so 
much.

1956
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,660
I even said that.
I was like,

1957
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,590
Oh,
you do,

1958
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:49,630
if I could be better,
but I think we all do from working at 

1959
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:50,650
the store,
it's just so awkward.

1960
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,540
I love it so much that I'm willing to 
put myself through it.

1961
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:53,920
Just to the awkwardness.
Well,

1962
01:27:53,921 --> 01:27:56,650
you know how when we were doing store 
all those years,

1963
01:27:56,651 --> 01:28:01,651
we'd have those crazy late night shows.
Like I think there's something about 

1964
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:02,240
those late night shows that like,
you know,

1965
01:28:02,241 --> 01:28:07,241
like there's times when we did gigs 
together where like if I did a Gig with 

1966
01:28:07,241 --> 01:28:09,540
Tripoli or me and Bret Ernst and um,
and um,

1967
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:13,990
Mike Young did a show once in Hollywood,
Florida and everybody killed.

1968
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:16,540
And one of the things with Brent and 
said when he killed,

1969
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:19,290
like right after he was bringing me up 
comedy store,

1970
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,920
a motherfucker,
you know,

1971
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:23,790
and it was like joking around like a 
clubhouse.

1972
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:26,890
It's a mentality.
It's like,

1973
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:30,100
you know,
you're working hard situations.

1974
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:35,250
The comedy store,
if you don't know the way it has always 

1975
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:35,570
been in La,
used to be that the criminals ran the,

1976
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:38,560
the insane people run the asylum.
But now it's more,

1977
01:28:38,561 --> 01:28:40,690
it's managed.
It's kind of sucks now because still the

1978
01:28:40,691 --> 01:28:42,910
door guys all want to be comments.
Everyone's a content.

1979
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:47,930
They're outside smoking and drinking 
when there's five hecklers and they're 

1980
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:48,040
yelling at you and eventually someone 
will get them.

1981
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:50,110
The places entirely black.
Everything's black.

1982
01:28:50,111 --> 01:28:52,450
The walls are black,
the floor is dirty,

1983
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,940
the coloring is black.
The building a whole building is black.

1984
01:28:54,941 --> 01:28:59,941
It's black building and it's just dark 
and it used to be a nightclub where 

1985
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:04,050
Bugsy Siegel owned in the 19 thirties 
and ship called Ciro's and it was like a

1986
01:29:04,051 --> 01:29:04,890
mob joint.

1987
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,450
We're like,
dudes were killed there,

1988
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:09,210
you know,
so it's got this weird fucking feel too.

1989
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:14,220
I mean for sure.
They chop people up and throw him in a 

1990
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:14,220
fucking freezer in that place.
The,

1991
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:18,670
what's it called?
The window where they said that Louis 

1992
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:22,460
used to watch the opening acts from 
their greenroom agreement has a window 

1993
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:25,971
you can and we can still use it today.
You go out there and you watch the main 

1994
01:29:25,971 --> 01:29:25,971
room,
but they said that because of where they

1995
01:29:25,971 --> 01:29:30,050
point out for the bouncers,
let's get him out so they wouldn't have 

1996
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:30,930
to go and make a hubbub in the room and 
just drag them out.

1997
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:33,780
They said the reasons,
but it's just.

1998
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:35,190
It was.
It's an amazing club.

1999
01:29:35,310 --> 01:29:37,680
There's three comedy rooms in it.
There's an upstairs,

2000
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:42,690
little tiny one called the belly room.
There's a an original room that's like 

2001
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:43,850
200 seats right about twitter and then 
there's a main room.

2002
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:47,910
It's like 400 seats and fucking club is 
just so sick.

2003
01:29:47,911 --> 01:29:52,911
Man.
So much fun shit has happened in that 

2004
01:29:52,911 --> 01:29:52,911
club.
It's a great development room.

2005
01:29:52,911 --> 01:29:54,330
That's it.
It's the best place to write material.

2006
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,630
It's.
It's less about like,

2007
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:59,520
I don't know.
People are so impressed with you there.

2008
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:02,080
Don't showcase their.
Never.

2009
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:07,100
You'll eat it.
It's very possible that you could never 

2010
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:10,241
tell you,
but the key to make a table that don't 

2011
01:30:10,241 --> 01:30:12,190
make a tape of the store,
you can never tell what's going to 

2012
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:12,190
happen.
You never tell.

2013
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:15,170
We've been showing situations where 
people are screaming things at each 

2014
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:15,170
other,
fights on stage,

2015
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:18,180
always pulled his cock out at least 10 
times that I know of.

2016
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:23,460
If I would be willing to bet money that 
he's pulled his dick out 10 times on 

2017
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:24,370
that stage that I saw because you saw,
yeah,

2018
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:29,550
to suppose balls at all time and just do
a set of balls out Stephen.

2019
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:33,330
So I put my balls who hated anything 
homosexual,

2020
01:30:33,331 --> 01:30:38,331
so I pulled my balls out and left a long
tee shirt over them because we're going 

2021
01:30:38,331 --> 01:30:40,971
to bring them on and I had them out 
before the entire set and there were a 

2022
01:30:40,971 --> 01:30:43,971
couple times where I raised my hand like
this and people would say just go up a 

2023
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:43,971
little bit.
So I had to be conscious of doing my set

2024
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:48,970
my hands down whole time and then when 
he got out because we were doing this 

2025
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:52,911
thing called cocking or would come 
behind you and just put my ball when 

2026
01:30:52,911 --> 01:30:55,250
you're at their arm bank,
just somewhere on your body.

2027
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:56,970
We never did the girls because that's 
creepy.

2028
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:59,850
That's illegal.
It's illegal to do is do dues too.

2029
01:30:59,851 --> 01:31:01,080
But if you call the cops,
you're a bitch.

2030
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:02,700
He was like,
don't you ever do that to me?

2031
01:31:02,701 --> 01:31:03,750
I'm like,
I'm going to copy you.

2032
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:04,990
And so,
uh,

2033
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:07,530
so I went to shake his hand and have to 
get off and I just pulled it in,

2034
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:11,400
melted

2035
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:16,750
for 15 minutes with regular jobs.
Can Not appreciate that there's 

2036
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:22,070
something very fun and being juvenile 
and you know,

2037
01:31:22,071 --> 01:31:27,071
everybody wants to get all mature and 
everybody wants to know that's all well 

2038
01:31:27,071 --> 01:31:27,780
and good.
Bottom line is your,

2039
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,670
this is a temporary life.
You're,

2040
01:31:29,671 --> 01:31:34,671
it's just temporary.
Taking yourself or anything seriously 

2041
01:31:34,671 --> 01:31:38,000
seems dumb to me.
It seems like you should be having as 

2042
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:38,000
much fun as possible.
Even as silly,

2043
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,040
stupid shit on each other.
I don't care.

2044
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:42,200
It could be a hundred years from now 
forwarding on.

2045
01:31:42,201 --> 01:31:47,201
People are still going to be funny when 
Joey Diaz comes over and then waves his 

2046
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:50,080
hand in front of his ass.
I mean,

2047
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:51,920
it's always funny.
It's always disgusting,

2048
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:56,090
but gets warmer clothes.
The only time that would make you angry,

2049
01:31:56,091 --> 01:31:57,890
you'd have to be so fucked up in your 
life,

2050
01:31:57,891 --> 01:32:02,891
like you have to be in a terrible.
But if at any normal time in life when 

2051
01:32:02,891 --> 01:32:02,891
it does that,
it's hilarious.

2052
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:07,900
The date.
Can we do this?

2053
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,370
What are you doing?
Hey.

2054
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:12,060
Hello.
Mrs.

2055
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:17,150
Very nice to meet you.
I'm getting it.

2056
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:21,840
Smoke it.
Sorry about that one.

2057
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:27,810
Yo Dog.
You got to give it right back.

2058
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,030
Would definitely do the.
He's stolen more letters from me.

2059
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,540
I should've learned some fucking home 
and beacons.

2060
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:36,440
Put a put a little beep.
Beep,

2061
01:32:36,441 --> 01:32:36,770
beep,
beep,

2062
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,220
beep,
beep.

2063
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:39,470
He used to always talk about him going 
to a 7:11

2064
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:40,990
shit.
Still Steel

2065
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:46,260
steel steel at the airport.
It's like 30 minutes.

2066
01:32:49,421 --> 01:32:50,350
We're going to miss it.
Like don't.

2067
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:51,880
Does he still do it?
He just,

2068
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:56,881
he does the tic tacs.
Remember when we went to Mcdonald's and 

2069
01:32:56,881 --> 01:32:57,580
it was one of the places where you 
grabbed like a quarter pounder.

2070
01:32:57,581 --> 01:32:59,620
You drag your fries and you go to the 
cashier.

2071
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,470
A quarter pounder fry.
He's just like quarter pounder.

2072
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:06,970
French fries in my shirt.
Get rid of the time I stole that food.

2073
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:09,490
You just gave him up.
Huh?

2074
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:11,680
You just gave them up on the Internet 
talking about Dunkin stressor.

2075
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:18,240
Brian and I were.
Were waiting for once and I forgot to 

2076
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:19,150
wait in line and then somebody kept 
yelling out ketosis,

2077
01:33:19,151 --> 01:33:21,290
ketosis and nobody picked them up.
Switch the fuck it.

2078
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:22,890
Oh,
that's right.

2079
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,300
I forgot.
You guys are killing me,

2080
01:33:25,301 --> 01:33:26,770
man.
It was scary.

2081
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:28,410
It was scary and so fast.
I mean,

2082
01:33:28,890 --> 01:33:33,580
I got caught for shoplifting was when 
CD's first came out and I was like 12 or

2083
01:33:33,581 --> 01:33:36,610
13 or something and I wanted a CD so 
bad.

2084
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,890
I had a CD player for my birthday.
They had one CD.

2085
01:33:38,891 --> 01:33:41,410
It was a ghost buster to soundtrack.
So I was like,

2086
01:33:41,411 --> 01:33:43,180
I need a new CD.
The soundtrack sucks.

2087
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:46,120
And so I went to the store with my 
friend and we,

2088
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:51,121
uh,
I stole three cds and got caught and it 

2089
01:33:51,121 --> 01:33:54,511
was so embarrassing as the CDs were 
Paula Abdul Mc Hammer and something 

2090
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:57,850
else,
like van Halen or something like that.

2091
01:33:57,851 --> 01:34:01,060
But then his family are.
Both of our families had to come.

2092
01:34:01,061 --> 01:34:01,420
We had to.

2093
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:06,620
Oh,
getting caught shoplifting never got 

2094
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:06,620
caught.
I got caught shoplifting,

2095
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:10,200
shoplifting,
shoplifting when I was about 13 or stole

2096
01:34:10,201 --> 01:34:15,201
a candy bar and uh,
we were about to leave and go to the 

2097
01:34:15,201 --> 01:34:15,420
movies and as I'm walking out of his 
store,

2098
01:34:15,421 --> 01:34:20,421
this guy came up and grabbed my arm,
really fucking went to a panty.

2099
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:21,690
Goes,
what'd you put in your pocket?

2100
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,790
Go what?
What is this?

2101
01:34:23,791 --> 01:34:24,930
Why get a candy bar in your pocket?
Like,

2102
01:34:24,931 --> 01:34:27,240
I totally didn't even need to do it.
I just want to see if I could do it.

2103
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:32,420
I've done it a couple of times.
I'd stolen like gum or something like 

2104
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:32,420
that and I just kept doing it.
You know,

2105
01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:33,130
when you're a kid you do,
you can just do it.

2106
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:34,770
I didn't think I was 13.
I was like 12.

2107
01:34:34,771 --> 01:34:36,960
I think the thing is you would have 
gotten in trouble with your parents.

2108
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:39,050
I was 13 because I was living in Boston.
Yeah.

2109
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:40,230
My,
that's terrible.

2110
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,640
Yeah.
My parents can find out about it.

2111
01:34:41,641 --> 01:34:46,641
I don't think.
I don't think they even told my parents 

2112
01:34:46,641 --> 01:34:46,641
just told me get the fuck out of there.
It was like a candy bar.

2113
01:34:46,641 --> 01:34:46,641
They didn't give a shit.
But like,

2114
01:34:46,641 --> 01:34:47,580
we could hold you,
we can bring you to jail.

2115
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:48,360
And I just said,
look,

2116
01:34:48,361 --> 01:34:49,590
I just want to scan.
I don't know why I did it.

2117
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:50,760
I'm stupid.
I'm sorry.

2118
01:34:50,761 --> 01:34:52,260
I apologize.
And I said,

2119
01:34:52,261 --> 01:34:52,640
uh,
I,

2120
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:53,820
I got away.
I told the truth.

2121
01:34:53,821 --> 01:34:58,821
I said I got away with it before and for
whatever reason I thought I could get 

2122
01:34:58,821 --> 01:34:58,821
away with it and like get the fuck out 
of here because Kevin,

2123
01:34:58,821 --> 01:35:01,100
our fucking country doing this,
I'm going to put you in fucking jail.

2124
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:03,590
Big Mustache,
big fucking fat head and got my face.

2125
01:35:03,591 --> 01:35:04,370
And I was like,
yes sir.

2126
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,320
Yes sir.
Thank you very much.

2127
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:11,440
Yeah,
I'm glad I got caught because if I 

2128
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:12,671
didn't I'd probably since I was so 
addicted to it because when Nintendo 

2129
01:35:12,671 --> 01:35:14,630
came out also surface service,
service,

2130
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:16,490
merchandise didn't know about video 
games.

2131
01:35:16,491 --> 01:35:18,200
We just put them on the shelf.
So me and my friend were like,

2132
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:18,760
Ooh,
Ooh,

2133
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:23,820
Ooh.
They put 10 in our pants and then we 

2134
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:25,460
would bury it outside of the store and 
get it back later because we didn't want

2135
01:35:25,461 --> 01:35:27,890
to come home and have like video games 
in

2136
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:32,890
high school.
Got busted stealing like a thousand 

2137
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:33,680
dollars where the shit she got some real
trouble.

2138
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:35,580
Wow.
Girls are.

2139
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,420
And I saw these pair of sunglasses that 
I thought were cool.

2140
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:40,160
I put in my pocket and as I'm walking 
out the door I'm like,

2141
01:35:40,161 --> 01:35:41,780
what am I get?
This thing goes off right now.

2142
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,630
What am I doing?
And I was like 17.

2143
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:47,030
It was like enough where I'm like,
they'll just charge me.

2144
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:48,860
I'm not cute.
Yeah,

2145
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:50,390
it's um,
it's scary shit.

2146
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:53,420
My girlfriend at the time,
I think she was 15 when she got caught,

2147
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:58,660
but she just wanted nice clothes.
Everybody had nice clothes and she was 

2148
01:35:59,091 --> 01:36:04,091
also a raised without a dad.
I think when people are raised under 

2149
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:04,220
dad,
very unbalanced,

2150
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:06,800
you know,
more subjects do crazy shit.

2151
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:08,950
Her mom worked all day,
you know,

2152
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,090
her mom didn't have enough money to take
care of her.

2153
01:36:11,210 --> 01:36:13,250
She couldn't put her in like a really 
nice daycare.

2154
01:36:13,251 --> 01:36:14,150
So you grow up,
you know,

2155
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:16,910
single parents or single single parents,
single child,

2156
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:18,810
you grow up a little crazy,
you know,

2157
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,070
she just thought she could get away with
it.

2158
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:21,800
She thought she was smart.
She was pretty smart.

2159
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:26,900
Start to get away with it either because
she was raised with no data are raised 

2160
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:26,900
with too much dad.
Yeah,

2161
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,740
she wasn't.
She wasn't.

2162
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:33,470
She wasn't fucked up like that.
She was just a little crazy.

2163
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:38,960
You look back on on chicks that you knew
when you're in high school and say,

2164
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:40,500
well,
if I got her pregnant too.

2165
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:42,950
I had a fucking kid with her.
What if I was still connected to her,

2166
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:45,940
but if I was pregnant and didn't have 
money to the real answer is,

2167
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:47,470
well,
can you imagine though?

2168
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:50,750
I mean not having money is one thing 
that that does suck,

2169
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:55,840
but being young and not having money and
trying to figure out how to raise a 

2170
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,961
child,
you chose still trying to figure out 

2171
01:36:58,961 --> 01:36:59,300
yourself in the best of your life,
the rest of your life,

2172
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:01,010
but it's so hard not to project on those
people,

2173
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:03,110
but it's like,
no,

2174
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:06,020
it's fine.
I would hate to fuck it up.

2175
01:37:06,021 --> 01:37:08,210
I was going to fuck up.
You know to,

2176
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:11,150
to raise a kid when you're a kid 
yourself,

2177
01:37:11,151 --> 01:37:11,740
man.
That's.

2178
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:14,930
You could do some irreparable damage to 
that fucking kid.

2179
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:18,590
You could teach them something,
some really terrible behavior patterns.

2180
01:37:18,591 --> 01:37:23,591
They even model them after you and me,
think about how dumb you were when you 

2181
01:37:23,591 --> 01:37:23,591
were 18.
Now imagine you are black.

2182
01:37:23,591 --> 01:37:26,020
He had aids and you're.
Yeah,

2183
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:27,350
you live in another country.
How about you?

2184
01:37:27,351 --> 01:37:28,790
Just by practice.
That's what the new presses.

2185
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,780
Yeah.
Yeah.

2186
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,490
I haven't seen it,
but I couldn't imagine.

2187
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,290
How about you born in the Congo.
How about that?

2188
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:38,470
How about you?
One of those dudes that fucking still 

2189
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:38,470
fishes by hanging a net over fucking 
moving river from a tree.

2190
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,550
They hang with their feet from fucking 
trees.

2191
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:44,660
Scoop to the water to.
It's not because the river is raging and

2192
01:37:44,661 --> 01:37:47,240
if they're not even wearing safety vests
and if they fall in that water,

2193
01:37:47,241 --> 01:37:48,920
they might be fucked.
There's some video.

2194
01:37:48,921 --> 01:37:51,560
These guys live in the Congo that are 
catching fish by doing that.

2195
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:54,890
It is wild to see man,
they are living right now.

2196
01:37:54,891 --> 01:37:59,891
The the fucking Navi lived in Avatar 
because no bullshit except they don't 

2197
01:37:59,891 --> 01:38:01,400
fly back.
Cool.

2198
01:38:01,570 --> 01:38:06,570
All the uncool or they come at you and 
they're killing things with spears and 

2199
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:12,170
bows and arrows and you know,
their fishing with nets while they're 

2200
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:12,370
hanging from trees.
It's local.

2201
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:15,720
It's crazy shit man.
And these guys are living in 2010.

2202
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:17,730
They don't have shit.
They don't have lights,

2203
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:20,040
they don't have electricity,
they don't have anything.

2204
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:21,900
They have no lighters,
they don't have shit.

2205
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,240
Occasionally you see one of them will be
wearing like,

2206
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:29,300
like western underwear,
like somebody got them some fucking 

2207
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:32,181
underwear or there won't be wearing a 
tee shirt or some shit like from the 

2208
01:38:32,181 --> 01:38:32,181
gap.
And you're like wow,

2209
01:38:32,181 --> 01:38:36,441
this is crazy.
And here they are living in these straw 

2210
01:38:36,441 --> 01:38:37,440
huts in the middle of the fucking jungle
surrounded by monsters.

2211
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:39,420
You know,
that is a scary,

2212
01:38:39,421 --> 01:38:42,030
scary life man.
That could have easily been us.

2213
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:43,250
You know,
you didn't have.

2214
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:45,570
People want to where you were born to be
born where I'm born.

2215
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:50,310
You could totally fuck up and all of a 
sudden you know any different.

2216
01:38:50,311 --> 01:38:51,900
But goddamn.
How lucky are we?

2217
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:52,980
I mean,
yeah,

2218
01:38:52,981 --> 01:38:54,470
you would be probably okay.
I mean,

2219
01:38:54,471 --> 01:38:55,840
people.
There's a lot of.

2220
01:38:56,290 --> 01:38:59,760
I think they look down on our lifestyle 
and look at them.

2221
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:02,250
They don't even know if it could have 
been born here in Afghanistan.

2222
01:39:02,251 --> 01:39:05,400
I had a good luck,
critical that they're proud to live in a

2223
01:39:05,401 --> 01:39:06,740
shitty towns.
I mean,

2224
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:08,880
there's a lot of people that are proud 
to live in Pittsburgh.

2225
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:11,040
You know what I'm saying?
For Real.

2226
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:16,090
You know,
you talk to people they fucking love 

2227
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:16,090
Pittsburgh.
Pull a dog.

2228
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:16,090
Fucking.
Pittsburgh's the only time for me.

2229
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:18,210
Or do you need to go to Australia?

2230
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:19,470
Because let me tell you something,
man.

2231
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:21,960
Everyone's friendly.
The women are gorgeous.

2232
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:24,690
Everyone's cool as fuck.
Everyone's super,

2233
01:39:24,691 --> 01:39:29,691
super relaxed.
Every third place to organ goes to 

2234
01:39:29,691 --> 01:39:29,691
visit.
This is the greatest place every month.

2235
01:39:29,691 --> 01:39:34,581
The moon with that want.
I always have this instinct to get out 

2236
01:39:34,581 --> 01:39:34,581
of La.
La Land came so close.

2237
01:39:34,581 --> 01:39:37,810
I was gone dress when I thought it was a
track me back in.

2238
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:43,280
They've fucking got me back.
The wife got knocked up in the mountain,

2239
01:39:43,591 --> 01:39:48,510
lion ate the dog and snow came accident 
on the hills.

2240
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,550
It's just too much.
I got crazy.

2241
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:52,740
I tried to move her right to the 
mountains.

2242
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:53,760
That's,
that was the big fuck.

2243
01:39:54,450 --> 01:39:59,450
I should've moved to boulder and got 
like a little take over territory then 

2244
01:39:59,450 --> 01:40:03,320
move.
I got this very strong desire to have 

2245
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:04,920
like a base very far away from the 
majority of civilization.

2246
01:40:04,921 --> 01:40:09,921
Like I have these crazy and it's not 
crazy thoughts of like the end of the 

2247
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:09,921
world.

2248
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:11,760
It's just like I just want no one around
you even do that here.

2249
01:40:11,761 --> 01:40:15,060
It's like any reason you have to be in 
La is 45 minutes away.

2250
01:40:15,370 --> 01:40:17,160
We'll hear well in light traffic.
Yeah.

2251
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:22,280
Have you always been like that or is 
that something that had knitted 

2252
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:22,280
recently?
No,

2253
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:23,910
I've always been like that when I.
I've moved further and further away from

2254
01:40:23,911 --> 01:40:26,490
the hives in the moment I moved to La.
When I first moved to La,

2255
01:40:26,491 --> 01:40:29,190
I had an apartment in north Hollywood.
Then I bought that.

2256
01:40:29,191 --> 01:40:33,480
I rented a house in Encino and then I 
kept going further and further out,

2257
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:34,910
you know,
and my next movement.

2258
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:39,690
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna stay in California and say I'm

2259
01:40:39,691 --> 01:40:44,691
going to get a place in big bear.
I want to go and get a place up in the 

2260
01:40:44,691 --> 01:40:44,691
mountains.
You know?

2261
01:40:44,691 --> 01:40:45,970
Yeah,
maybe I should buy his place,

2262
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:49,830
but it's like I wonder if she'll sell 
it.

2263
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:51,060
I want to lend.
Even uses it.

2264
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:53,010
You don't like that.
What the fuck?

2265
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:55,200
Junky spirits in that fucking house.
Okay.

2266
01:40:55,690 --> 01:40:57,430
What are you trying to do?
We're worshiping Satan.

2267
01:40:57,431 --> 01:41:02,431
Joe Rogan.
He's in India as you know what I would 

2268
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:02,650
like to get just a little cabin,
just somewhat somewhere where I can just

2269
01:41:02,651 --> 01:41:06,280
go and just hear nothing.
That's what I love the most.

2270
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:07,990
Medical.
I mean,

2271
01:41:07,991 --> 01:41:12,991
you,
you went to that place when you are out 

2272
01:41:12,991 --> 01:41:12,991
that window when we were on the porch 
and you listen,

2273
01:41:12,991 --> 01:41:15,550
you don't hear a fucking thing.
It's,

2274
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:17,430
it's,
you hear the silence.

2275
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:19,660
It's like a very specific sound of its 
own.

2276
01:41:19,870 --> 01:41:20,770
I've heard in the redwoods

2277
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:23,480
as [inaudible] the canopy so,
so high above the ground.

2278
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,570
There's no real birds and there's no 
real insects there.

2279
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:28,310
Um,
because the stuff,

2280
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:30,230
I don't know how it falls up so there's 
nothing going on.

2281
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,960
So we really is just silence 
occasionally here.

2282
01:41:32,961 --> 01:41:37,961
Squirrel whenever you see one.
But generally it's just like nothing's 

2283
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:37,961
happening.

2284
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:41,350
I got to go back to that suck.
No Man is supposed to be was like miles 

2285
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:43,520
and miles around and we drove our car 
through the tree and I want to,

2286
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:48,630
I want to do that.
Douchey people are fucking trees had 

2287
01:41:48,630 --> 01:41:50,430
been around for like a million years is 
gigantic fucking treat.

2288
01:41:50,431 --> 01:41:52,560
It's as big as this room or what do they
do?

2289
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:58,140
Have a big hole in the center of it so 
people can drive their cars through the 

2290
01:41:58,140 --> 01:41:59,020
fucking tree.
This is like a novelty goof.

2291
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:00,320
Like they carved out.
Well,

2292
01:42:00,321 --> 01:42:01,990
that's where the road was,
right?

2293
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:05,260
That,
that's where the road was.

2294
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,320
They didn't have to do that.
I mean,

2295
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:10,140
it seems like more humane to kill the 
tree than to use it.

2296
01:42:10,730 --> 01:42:13,750
It's a fucking cherry.
Trees can feel.

2297
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:15,260
They just can't communicate,
you know?

2298
01:42:15,261 --> 01:42:17,380
And that's a very valid argument,
you know,

2299
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:18,760
we don't know.
We know that there's,

2300
01:42:18,890 --> 01:42:23,890
um,
I don't know if this has been 

2301
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:25,620
scientifically validated,
but there's been all sorts of studies 

2302
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:25,620
that prove that,
that tree's like,

2303
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:28,780
like feel something like there's an 
electrical impulse when you snip them.

2304
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:31,310
I will tell you this,
there was an episode of Mamma's family,

2305
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,050
uh,
in which the goofball son,

2306
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:38,200
uh,
here's a study that says a cauliflower 

2307
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,930
can feel pain.
Broccoli does not have that same 

2308
01:42:40,930 --> 01:42:40,930
problem.

2309
01:42:40,930 --> 01:42:41,240
Maybe that was where all the work was 
done.

2310
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,520
That's not real,
but who the fuck knows,

2311
01:42:46,521 --> 01:42:47,040
man?
You know,

2312
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,670
who knows if it doesn't hurt their 
feelings when you eat them,

2313
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:51,290
who knows?
It's not a good enough reason to,

2314
01:42:51,291 --> 01:42:56,291
to or not to do anything argued that 
video game characters can probably feel.

2315
01:42:56,540 --> 01:43:01,540
Maybe they're playing a pretty quick,
maybe you're fucking somebody up and 

2316
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:03,140
another dementia that,
that video game.

2317
01:43:03,141 --> 01:43:06,290
How do you know that has feelings?
As much as I'm a cabbage,

2318
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:11,590
you know,
that's just where it starts getting 

2319
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:11,590
ridiculous.
Then who cares?

2320
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:11,720
You know,
you have to have lips.

2321
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,990
They won't eat anything that has a face.
Yeah.

2322
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:15,590
Yeah.

2323
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:17,240
There's,
there's like people who will eat,

2324
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:22,690
they will eat things like they'll eat 
like clams and they'll eat like some 

2325
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:23,840
shellfish and what?
They won't eat anything with a face.

2326
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:29,230
What does that thing?
Speaking of faces creeping and mass 

2327
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:29,230
cheap,
but it's got someone's mouth.

2328
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:32,300
They're not watching some girls,
so for Brian just comes up with weird.

2329
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:37,540
Have you seen us in a weird ass banners?
We're talking about the thing that's on 

2330
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:37,540
my website.
It's on Joe Rogan dot.

2331
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:37,800
No,
well,

2332
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:39,290
there's weird bands and saw Brian.

2333
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:44,350
I'd like to throw in a lot of subliminal
porn into it because it.

2334
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:45,780
It works.
Yeah.

2335
01:43:45,781 --> 01:43:47,760
I think that you're like,
what the fuck is this?

2336
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:51,170
When it makes you look at the poster,
he lives down there by the end.

2337
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:51,710
Yeah.

2338
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:57,190
It makes you look at the poster where 
like a lot of times if it's just you 

2339
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:57,190
with a microphone is like,
okay,

2340
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:57,190
yeah,
whatever.

2341
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:59,100
You just know.
I love them man.

2342
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:04,300
But I think if you just brighten the 
contrast in there will be even more 

2343
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:06,280
excited with the n is I feel like I see 
something.

2344
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:11,370
Right.
Isn't it funny that that's exciting to 

2345
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:11,840
almost see some tips or some policy,
but you can see just

2346
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:13,360
you can just go to a different website.

2347
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:16,500
Internet.
Yeah.

2348
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:22,430
I can't live in a mountain man because 
if there's like any of the road shit 

2349
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:22,990
happens,
I need to be around just in case I might

2350
01:44:22,991 --> 01:44:27,991
have to meet.
It's not even an end of the world and 

2351
01:44:27,991 --> 01:44:28,080
you have to discuss it,
but it was like,

2352
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:31,450
it was like overload.
It's just too much to too many days in a

2353
01:44:31,451 --> 01:44:33,040
row where it was like,
oh,

2354
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:36,020
that's why they're doing this.
Sometimes I overloaded on the road,

2355
01:44:36,570 --> 01:44:38,560
on the road.
Sometimes too much porn.

2356
01:44:38,590 --> 01:44:43,590
I just see it as maybe being animals.
Either that or this way where I just 

2357
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:47,581
feel empathy for women.
How about when you beat off and like 

2358
01:44:47,581 --> 01:44:49,190
only a dribble comes out because that's 
all you got left like a three,

2359
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:52,390
three day or four feet off like three 
times in a day.

2360
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:57,480
And you think you're doing it because 
you'll try and get some sleep like you 

2361
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:01,120
in the morning.
Like sometimes I wake up and I'd get up 

2362
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:01,120
too early and I'm like,
I can sleep in.

2363
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:02,020
I need my sleep.
Let me just turn it off real quick.

2364
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:04,920
So jerk off and then I'm like,
get ready to go to the gym.

2365
01:45:04,921 --> 01:45:07,240
I it a little horny for the gym.
It was just jerked off,

2366
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:12,740
jerked off,
and then I'll go and do the show and 

2367
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:13,000
then I go to the show to stand up,
go to the for Jujitsu.

2368
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:13,660
Sometimes

2369
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:17,910
I want you to three times

2370
01:45:19,370 --> 01:45:21,350
wash for Jujitsu,
very conscientious,

2371
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:24,680
listen to everybody jerks off and then 
it goes to Jujitsu.

2372
01:45:24,681 --> 01:45:26,840
Everybody that goes to Jitsu jerks off 
and then goes there.

2373
01:45:26,841 --> 01:45:28,800
It's just a matter of.
How long ago was.

2374
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:31,370
That wasn't a month ago.
Was it a year ago?

2375
01:45:31,590 --> 01:45:35,150
They like to wipe it or they go away.
That's true.

2376
01:45:35,190 --> 01:45:36,590
You never know.
You never know.

2377
01:45:36,591 --> 01:45:38,580
And can trust people.
Trust no one.

2378
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:42,200
But then I'll go get home from the Gig.
I'll do a Gig,

2379
01:45:42,290 --> 01:45:45,750
I'll be wired and then I can of get some
sleep so I'll beat off man,

2380
01:45:45,770 --> 01:45:46,500
get some sleep.
What?

2381
01:45:46,501 --> 01:45:49,230
At the time I didn't know where it just.
Oh,

2382
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,560
I kind of already about this.
He's a sprayer.

2383
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:53,050
Like when he,
when he chokes out,

2384
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:58,080
it just blows up once in a while and 
it's based on the shoulder.

2385
01:45:59,831 --> 01:46:04,831
Why does it do that?
Or do you like hold down the tip like a 

2386
01:46:04,831 --> 01:46:05,160
garden hose and try to spread something 
like that?

2387
01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:06,400
Probably the way I do it,
I don't know,

2388
01:46:06,890 --> 01:46:11,270
just got a lot of fucking time.
Just because you come with.

2389
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:15,830
No,
not me.

2390
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:20,980
Oh,
so it's a girl doing it or me I'm doing 

2391
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:20,980
it for whatever.
It's like,

2392
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:21,680
let me just let him beat off.
Or if she does it,

2393
01:46:21,681 --> 01:46:23,900
just fuck it.
Let's be honest about something.

2394
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:26,030
What is better?
What is better?

2395
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:30,240
A great load,
a great low,

2396
01:46:30,241 --> 01:46:32,750
shooting a great load or taking a great 
shit.

2397
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:36,200
I would go to the great,
great mode,

2398
01:46:36,201 --> 01:46:38,600
but not by much.
Not by much.

2399
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:44,100
Give me that.
Here's a great look or grid much for the

2400
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:50,080
question.
Here's the question is how many times 

2401
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:50,370
have you shot a and then you realize,

2402
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:53,520
oh my God,
now I have to talk this crazy bitch that

2403
01:46:53,521 --> 01:46:58,521
I just shot a load with and she's trying
to get the fuck out of there and you're 

2404
01:46:58,521 --> 01:47:02,961
tired and you realize you've got to 
drive an hour to get her to stay over 

2405
01:47:02,961 --> 01:47:03,720
and you're like,
I can't.

2406
01:47:03,721 --> 01:47:06,230
I have to feed the dogs.
Like any kind of craziness that goes on,

2407
01:47:06,231 --> 01:47:06,810
you're like,
oh my God,

2408
01:47:06,811 --> 01:47:08,910
what am I doing with my life?
Whereas when you take a shit,

2409
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:09,290
there's none of that.

2410
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:12,140
I think here's the load in your show 
point.

2411
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:17,450
Just had sex a lot more than Brian and I
are more like interested in like,

2412
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:18,450
yeah,
whatever.

2413
01:47:18,930 --> 01:47:20,600
But we're like,
what sucks

2414
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:22,850
drug?
Good Shit.

2415
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:27,260
I really appreciate the morning ones.
Sometimes you wake up and you're like,

2416
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:28,380
oh,
Jesus says,

2417
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:29,870
well you get the toilet.
So it's like,

2418
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:31,080
because I eat a lot of salads,
you know,

2419
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:32,420
machine comes quick,
so it's like

2420
01:47:33,770 --> 01:47:36,510
blah blah blah.
See My,

2421
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:39,850
my Shit's always involved in 
investigating and identifying,

2422
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,260
looking at your poop.
Well,

2423
01:47:43,261 --> 01:47:47,080
that's because Brian has blood in his 
poop.

2424
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:47,900
No

2425
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:53,050
once in a while.
It's right now.

2426
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:55,060
I'm just making that up.
I'm ending up now.

2427
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:56,890
I,
uh,

2428
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,170
once I had a hemorrhoid and it had to 
get A.

2429
01:47:59,230 --> 01:48:00,500
I already talked to internal 
hemorrhoids.

2430
01:48:01,170 --> 01:48:02,140
Yeah.
Right.

2431
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:06,070
So that's why he goes to investigate.
I could upload it puts.

2432
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:07,870
It's just like,
Whoa,

2433
01:48:08,110 --> 01:48:10,690
what is interesting about it?
Find out what I will go to wipe like,

2434
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:11,530
oh,
was that a winter?

2435
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:12,340
She said,
I was like,

2436
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,360
oh no,
it's super wet.

2437
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:14,980
I could never tell a story about.
I just like,

2438
01:48:14,981 --> 01:48:17,440
it doesn't hurt though.
They were telling you about when I,

2439
01:48:17,441 --> 01:48:22,441
uh,
when I first started wearing a cup and 

2440
01:48:22,441 --> 01:48:23,821
Jujitsu I didn't use,
I had to start wearing makeup because I 

2441
01:48:23,821 --> 01:48:28,411
was rolling with Einstein and he was 
trying to pass my card and he slammed 

2442
01:48:28,411 --> 01:48:29,710
into me right into my Dick.
Like,

2443
01:48:29,711 --> 01:48:33,360
not even like my shin hit my balls,
but they need hit the Dick was,

2444
01:48:33,710 --> 01:48:34,990
the president had it a lot more.

2445
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:36,010
Why?
Why are you covering your head?

2446
01:48:36,011 --> 01:48:38,640
Because I hate this story.
Oh sorry.

2447
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:43,660
But he's slammed it in my.
To get hurt so much it was so fucking 

2448
01:48:44,081 --> 01:48:47,050
painful,
but so I wait until I feel better,

2449
01:48:47,051 --> 01:48:52,051
you know,
I take a couple minutes to catch my 

2450
01:48:52,051 --> 01:48:52,051
breath and then we started rolling 
again.

2451
01:48:52,051 --> 01:48:52,750
I didn't think anything of it until I 
get changed.

2452
01:48:52,751 --> 01:48:54,310
I go in the locker room and I go to take
my.

2453
01:48:54,311 --> 01:48:59,311
I take my pants off and I go to take my 
underwear or my jock strap off and it's 

2454
01:48:59,311 --> 01:49:04,290
filled with blood filled with blood.
Blood is leaking out of the tip of my 

2455
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:04,690
Dick.
And I'm like,

2456
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:07,000
oh my God.
I broke my Dick.

2457
01:49:07,090 --> 01:49:12,090
So then I go into the bathroom and pee.
So I go to p and blood is just coming 

2458
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:15,210
right out of tip my Dick Blood in urine.
So then I started thinking about it.

2459
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:15,880
I go,
okay,

2460
01:49:15,881 --> 01:49:17,380
I got a problem.
I've got to do something.

2461
01:49:17,381 --> 01:49:18,580
Now I've got,
I've got a problem.

2462
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:20,140
I might have to get my teeth fixed.
I'm like,

2463
01:49:20,141 --> 01:49:21,690
Holy Shit.
And then I thought about it.

2464
01:49:21,691 --> 01:49:22,150
I'm like,
okay,

2465
01:49:22,151 --> 01:49:25,180
but wait a minute.
If this was my nose and blood was coming

2466
01:49:25,181 --> 01:49:26,500
out of my nose when I do anything about 
it,

2467
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:27,520
no,
I wouldn't do shit about it.

2468
01:49:27,521 --> 01:49:29,050
I would just let it heal.
Okay,

2469
01:49:29,051 --> 01:49:34,051
let's just,
let's just let your Dick Hill and see 

2470
01:49:34,051 --> 01:49:34,051
how it goes.
So I'd get home that night and I say,

2471
01:49:34,051 --> 01:49:34,360
well,
I don't know man.

2472
01:49:34,361 --> 01:49:36,220
Maybe I should go to the fucking doctor.
Okay.

2473
01:49:36,221 --> 01:49:38,140
If my dick get hard,
I'm not going to go to the doctor.

2474
01:49:38,290 --> 01:49:41,620
So I jerked off.
I jerked off and I shot a bloody load.

2475
01:49:41,650 --> 01:49:43,030
Is it pink?
It will know.

2476
01:49:43,031 --> 01:49:45,430
It was like a chicken egg that has the 
embryo in it.

2477
01:49:46,630 --> 01:49:51,630
You know what I'm talking about?
You get a chicken egg and that's in the 

2478
01:49:52,391 --> 01:49:57,391
Philippines.
That's a blue balloon is like an actual 

2479
01:49:57,391 --> 01:49:57,391
embryo,
like a big ass.

2480
01:49:57,391 --> 01:50:02,370
Much more close to kosher.
You get one drop of blood in the what 

2481
01:50:02,370 --> 01:50:05,230
you get all the time and then throw it 
up and use it separately.

2482
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:07,720
No,
it makes sense.

2483
01:50:07,721 --> 01:50:12,721
You don't know what the fuck happened.
That things bleeding there and that 

2484
01:50:12,721 --> 01:50:12,721
blood is human life has we killed 
differently than a human lives.

2485
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:18,630
But not only that,
it's probably smart for like health 

2486
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:18,630
reasons,
that blood is just sitting in that egg.

2487
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:21,190
An egg can keep probably better than 
blood.

2488
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:24,610
Ken The border,
I mean that's just speculation,

2489
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:29,820
but your bottom line is I jerked off to 
see if my dick was okay and I know it.

2490
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:36,550
It didn't feel that good,
like the best jerk off session I've ever

2491
01:50:36,551 --> 01:50:41,551
had.
But then the next day I peed blood a 

2492
01:50:41,551 --> 01:50:43,771
couple more times.
People are just a little bit less every 

2493
01:50:43,771 --> 01:50:44,080
time for like three days.
And then I stopped.

2494
01:50:44,081 --> 01:50:45,580
There was no more blood and I said,
I think it's okay.

2495
01:50:45,581 --> 01:50:50,581
I think it would have only taken one day
and I would have freaked out and went 

2496
01:50:50,581 --> 01:50:50,581
right to.
It didn't hurt.

2497
01:50:50,581 --> 01:50:51,850
That's why.
No,

2498
01:50:52,090 --> 01:50:53,090
no.
God.

2499
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,970
Well I was thinking I was.
What I was worried about was that it was

2500
01:50:57,971 --> 01:50:59,020
going to break.
You know,

2501
01:50:59,021 --> 01:51:00,490
I was like,
my Dick is not going work anymore.

2502
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:03,840
I'm my.
I'm infinite off.

2503
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:09,470
You imagine if you get gang green.
If it were to rebuild one,

2504
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,910
they have to take a chunk out of meat 
out of your forearm.

2505
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:14,980
I saw that online,
a dude had his dick rebuilt and maybe it

2506
01:51:14,981 --> 01:51:17,380
was like a woman who had a dick rebuilt 
to become a man.

2507
01:51:17,810 --> 01:51:19,040
It could be a fake Dick.
Oh,

2508
01:51:19,050 --> 01:51:24,050
that's so crazy.
Wouldn't you be concerned at all at the 

2509
01:51:24,050 --> 01:51:24,100
time?
And I'm not joking that the doctor would

2510
01:51:24,101 --> 01:51:29,101
be like,
if you hadn't gotten hard so fast would 

2511
01:51:29,101 --> 01:51:29,101
be okay with the fact that it broke the 
seal or something.

2512
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:34,350
You weren't worried about that?
I was thinking that maybe my loads with 

2513
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:35,680
purified whatever injury I had in there,
my soldiers for the work on it,

2514
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:36,640
patch it up.

2515
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:43,320
I thought you were going to do that.
I think urine is supposed to heal 

2516
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:46,351
things.
So if you pee when you have a little 

2517
01:51:46,351 --> 01:51:47,680
wound inside your dick is probably good 
to piss out blood and cleans it out.

2518
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:50,560
Yeah,
you're in sterile.

2519
01:51:50,561 --> 01:51:51,880
It's good for you.
I bet.

2520
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,610
I bet it probably does,
but I,

2521
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:55,780
that was a close call.
So from then on I wear a coat,

2522
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,170
so no,
uh,

2523
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,330
no blood in my shit but some bloody 
loads.

2524
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:05,280
It's bloody pep.
So yeah,

2525
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:06,500
it was beautiful.
Beautiful.

2526
01:52:06,501 --> 01:52:11,501
What you sort of lead,
what I don't do shit that involves 

2527
01:52:11,501 --> 01:52:11,501
having a wear cups of people won't hit 
my nuts.

2528
01:52:11,501 --> 01:52:15,950
I don't people.
I'd never worn one Jujitsu.

2529
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:18,420
You should wear one dude.
I'll get an extra one too.

2530
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:23,630
He likes to swear.
Sounds fishy smelling Ben Gay.

2531
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:31,680
Tried it on and do with fucking Dave's 
insanity sauce and it won't even kick in

2532
01:52:32,021 --> 01:52:34,210
until you start sweating and you 
imagine,

2533
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:37,570
Oh my God,
your Dick would be on fire.

2534
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:42,780
I pissed was after I had a,
a Burrito with days and Saturday sauce 

2535
01:52:42,780 --> 01:52:42,780
and I just,
I don't know,

2536
01:52:42,780 --> 01:52:44,590
I'm not saying that some residue on my 
finger.

2537
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:46,790
And I touched the head of my deck and it
was like,

2538
01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:49,300
it was melting like a Mexican below 
John.

2539
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:54,500
It was,
it's like that for all of the sunflower 

2540
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,840
seed peppers,
sunflowers in Israel.

2541
01:52:56,841 --> 01:52:58,760
They have this huge sunflower seeds like
that big.

2542
01:52:59,050 --> 01:53:00,870
And so people always take it from my 
desk.

2543
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:02,720
So I wanted to punish the people who 
didn't ask.

2544
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:03,320
Oh,
so you put.

2545
01:53:03,450 --> 01:53:08,450
So I spent all day and I crushed up.
How about Arrow peppers seeds out and 

2546
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:11,000
put one seed inside each sunflower seed 
and then if people.

2547
01:53:11,001 --> 01:53:12,280
I'll leave that in front so people ask 
that,

2548
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:12,680
but no,
no.

2549
01:53:12,681 --> 01:53:14,180
Here's the normal ones,
but if they wouldn't,

2550
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:19,240
they just fucking get it.
Most people can't stand the heat but do 

2551
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:22,301
not wash out my hands period and just 
had to shower with my pants around my 

2552
01:53:22,301 --> 01:53:22,301
ankles and it just start like,
oh,

2553
01:53:22,301 --> 01:53:23,100
oh,
oh.

2554
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:27,620
And you're like,
what's happening?

2555
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:31,730
Water Pepo do to get their dick 
tattooed.

2556
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:33,680
Yeah.
What the fuck man.

2557
01:53:33,681 --> 01:53:38,681
How much most sensitive area hasn't 
built a tolerance.

2558
01:53:39,090 --> 01:53:42,980
Anything.
Jesus Christ and it feels awesome.

2559
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:45,460
Can you dictate?
Maybe it's just like hard.

2560
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:52,680
Brian wants to get fucked.
That's what I wonder if anybody's 

2561
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:52,680
tattooed to Dick and had them come on 
them.

2562
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:59,690
Put the pause on the balls.
You just scored so low.

2563
01:53:59,691 --> 01:54:04,691
Yeah,
they definitely have gotten hard before 

2564
01:54:04,691 --> 01:54:04,691
to attend to it.
That's definitely happened and she's not

2565
01:54:04,691 --> 01:54:04,880
even on purpose.
Not even appropriate.

2566
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,020
It could just be incidental.
Especially like really crazy freaky gate

2567
01:54:08,021 --> 01:54:09,450
bond type.
Do you know,

2568
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:13,400
has bravo bid on that Tattoo show yet?
Eric?

2569
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,070
An,
I don't know,

2570
01:54:16,071 --> 01:54:21,071
I mean I think they filmed the whole 
season in advance and he just did it a 

2571
01:54:21,071 --> 01:54:21,071
couple of months ago.
I was a good ass tattoo man.

2572
01:54:21,071 --> 01:54:22,400
A chicken.
She's a really good artist.

2573
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:25,550
Eddie Bravo got his grandmother tattooed
on his chest.

2574
01:54:26,190 --> 01:54:29,000
Incredible.
Incredible artwork.

2575
01:54:29,001 --> 01:54:31,010
Man.
I fucking love those tattoos.

2576
01:54:31,011 --> 01:54:33,140
I don't have any of them,
which I love those portraits.

2577
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:38,650
Yeah,
it'd be creepy unless it means something

2578
01:54:39,681 --> 01:54:40,430
to you.
Like for Eddie,

2579
01:54:40,431 --> 01:54:45,431
his grandmother was the person who 
really cared about him when he was a 

2580
01:54:45,431 --> 01:54:45,431
kid.

2581
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:51,600
You went to high school with the kid and
then all of a sudden you run into him 

2582
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:51,600
and he's got you tattooed on his arm and
be like,

2583
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:52,880
listen man.
It's ironic.

2584
01:54:52,910 --> 01:54:54,650
We just picked her out of the yearbook 
at random.

2585
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:57,190
Don't be weird about it.
Usually that crazy ambitious.

2586
01:54:57,390 --> 01:55:02,390
I'm going to kill you.
Ray Romano tattooed on her back because 

2587
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:02,390
she hated her mom.
No,

2588
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:03,440
she just did it because you know 
everybody loves.

2589
01:55:03,441 --> 01:55:08,441
Raymond was not tattooed as a tramp 
stamp.

2590
01:55:08,451 --> 01:55:13,451
It says I'm going to kill you,
Ray Romano and how she's thinking it's 

2591
01:55:13,451 --> 01:55:13,451
out.
People are interested.

2592
01:55:13,451 --> 01:55:13,451
It's on the Internet.
Yeah.

2593
01:55:13,490 --> 01:55:18,490
How crazy is that bitch is that bitch 
ever has kids and the kids can never 

2594
01:55:18,490 --> 01:55:18,530
take her seriously.
Like,

2595
01:55:18,531 --> 01:55:19,190
mom,
listen to me.

2596
01:55:19,191 --> 01:55:20,220
You've done ask.
You've got.

2597
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:22,520
I'm going to kill you.
Ray Romano on your fucking back.

2598
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:25,820
Those Ray Romano.
That was a popular sitcoms decisions,

2599
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:29,660
which might have been your best 
impression.

2600
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:30,020
Brian.

2601
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:37,580
He's hilarious.
That guy.

2602
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:40,760
I started working with him like way,
way back in the early nineties.

2603
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:46,060
We did Jimmy's comedy alley in I'm 
thinking was in queens somewhere in New 

2604
01:55:46,060 --> 01:55:47,040
York,
I think it was in Queens.

2605
01:55:47,370 --> 01:55:48,690
And uh,
he,

2606
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:50,760
he was the headliner.
I was the middle.

2607
01:55:50,910 --> 01:55:52,890
I got to see him like when he was at his
peak.

2608
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:55,080
He was a really,
really good standup man.

2609
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,560
Twitter's good.
So yeah,

2610
01:55:56,590 --> 01:55:57,270
it's interesting.
Well,

2611
01:55:57,271 --> 01:55:58,830
he's always good.
He's just,

2612
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:00,660
he's,
he's just got a great delivery,

2613
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:02,460
you know,
he's just a,

2614
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:07,260
he's a super nice guy.
He's always been kind of clean,

2615
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:09,090
you know,
clean.

2616
01:56:09,110 --> 01:56:11,550
Like he did a bit on Kevin and been show
last year,

2617
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:16,840
so April foolishness.
Hilarious bit about if guys could blow 

2618
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,300
ourselves,
we'd have to wear like a dog collar.

2619
01:56:18,750 --> 01:56:20,560
It was really fun.
Get more into it now.

2620
01:56:20,570 --> 01:56:21,930
So you couldn't.
So you keep your,

2621
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:23,320
your husband from blowing himself.

2622
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:26,280
He would have to put out like one of the
girls was a very funny man.

2623
01:56:26,690 --> 01:56:29,430
It was a really good bond or something.
No,

2624
01:56:29,431 --> 01:56:29,790
no,
no.

2625
01:56:29,791 --> 01:56:32,790
It was very funny and he had a bunch of 
good stuff.

2626
01:56:32,791 --> 01:56:36,060
You know,
just even stuff like about Sun pooping,

2627
01:56:36,290 --> 01:56:41,290
you know,
you think it's like it's innocent 

2628
01:56:41,290 --> 01:56:41,640
trumpet.
It's really well worded and great timing

2629
01:56:41,641 --> 01:56:46,641
and really good economy of words.
He's a really good craftsman know 

2630
01:56:46,641 --> 01:56:47,820
material.
That's why I show is so fine.

2631
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:49,500
That guy,
I met him,

2632
01:56:49,770 --> 01:56:52,050
you know,
here's a new job I did.

2633
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:54,710
I didn't steal somebody else.
Luckily somebody else called.

2634
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:56,990
I stole it from that pilot.
Yes.

2635
01:56:57,030 --> 01:56:58,410
He got it.
And then they fight.

2636
01:56:58,411 --> 01:57:00,540
They didn't want him for the actual show
and then they hired me.

2637
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:01,890
That's what happened.
So I didn't,

2638
01:57:01,891 --> 01:57:03,900
I didn't feel bad.
There was already bad before me.

2639
01:57:03,901 --> 01:57:04,680
I just took it from him.

2640
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:06,120
But Ray was a friend,
you know.

2641
01:57:06,121 --> 01:57:08,010
So it was weird to run into him,
you know,

2642
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:09,840
but then all of a sudden he got his 
show,

2643
01:57:09,841 --> 01:57:14,841
which was like 100 times more successful
in radio and was perfect because he 

2644
01:57:14,841 --> 01:57:15,570
controlled the whole thing.
And when,

2645
01:57:15,571 --> 01:57:16,800
uh,
when we were hanging out,

2646
01:57:16,801 --> 01:57:19,020
when you first got the show was me and 
him and Kevin,

2647
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:24,050
Kevin James,
we're all eating dinner at Jerry's Deli 

2648
01:57:24,050 --> 01:57:26,450
and ray was like obsessive harm.
Maybe if I have the guy come in like 

2649
01:57:26,450 --> 01:57:28,800
this and just kept going.
He was like obsessed with the.

2650
01:57:28,801 --> 01:57:30,750
Yeah,
just putting it together perfectly,

2651
01:57:30,751 --> 01:57:35,751
you know,
he was really like trying to construct 

2652
01:57:35,751 --> 01:57:35,751
it in his head and he was obsessed with 
it.

2653
01:57:35,751 --> 01:57:38,610
It wasn't.
There was any good luck at all with him.

2654
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:44,660
He had to take this hbo special back 
when it really meant something and they 

2655
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:45,410
were holding it for like a year,
year and a half where they're like,

2656
01:57:45,450 --> 01:57:46,560
no,
we're not ready to release it because we

2657
01:57:46,561 --> 01:57:46,940
want to do this.

2658
01:57:46,990 --> 01:57:48,540
He's like,
I'm broke.

2659
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:50,420
I need some money,
please.

2660
01:57:50,650 --> 01:57:52,020
People will see it.
Right.

2661
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:58,020
Wow.
I suppose that's always a concern when 

2662
01:57:58,020 --> 01:57:58,620
you have a special and you film it,
you don't own it,

2663
01:57:58,621 --> 01:58:00,630
and this is before the Internet,
you know,

2664
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:02,140
you could really get crazy and go,
you know,

2665
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:03,540
I'm going to fucking releases on the 
Internet.

2666
01:58:03,541 --> 01:58:05,670
You guys can suck my dick if you're 
really crazy,

2667
01:58:06,090 --> 01:58:07,260
you know,
if they caught you though,

2668
01:58:07,261 --> 01:58:12,261
you'd be fucked.
They caught you and they could prove 

2669
01:58:12,261 --> 01:58:12,261
that you took away the profits for your 
own thing.

2670
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:15,390
Like they pulled my shit from youtube,
my own shit.

2671
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:17,010
Yeah.
They've had the.

2672
01:58:17,130 --> 01:58:18,930
Yeah,
that's nuts.

2673
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:23,960
When your own bits get pulled off your 
own youtube page and give you the 

2674
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:27,420
copyright.
So they said don't say hbo with other 

2675
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:27,420
searches for that.
Ah,

2676
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:30,720
that's very smart of broader.
Yeah.

2677
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:32,720
Do you put that up online?

2678
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:35,880
You're HPL sets.
Are they going to do more of those?

2679
01:58:35,881 --> 01:58:36,810
The downed dirties?
No,

2680
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:38,040
no more.
No,

2681
01:58:38,430 --> 01:58:41,320
they didn't like it.
I didn't think got ratings or something.

2682
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:44,760
They're not promoted right away.
Not really.

2683
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:49,100
Hbo Does Not really handle comedy that 
will promote a pin,

2684
01:58:49,710 --> 01:58:52,840
which I decided to draw,
but too often it seems like they're just

2685
01:58:52,841 --> 01:58:54,400
trying to put things that are like 
different.

2686
01:58:54,650 --> 01:58:56,950
Try to.
It's not like their new one is all sober

2687
01:58:56,951 --> 01:59:01,951
comedy.
That's a new series of like with Boston 

2688
01:59:01,951 --> 01:59:01,951
Norton.
Oh really?

2689
01:59:01,951 --> 01:59:06,510
All sober people there.
The good thing about that is a lot of 

2690
01:59:06,510 --> 01:59:06,510
the guys that are sober,
sober for a reason,

2691
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:12,200
so they've got some great stories.
You know what a church sobriety this is 

2692
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:13,270
like,
I fucked up my life.

2693
01:59:13,271 --> 01:59:15,220
Sobriety.
There's a lot of dudes like that.

2694
01:59:15,310 --> 01:59:17,110
There was a lot of dudes that were doing
a clean,

2695
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:19,660
clean Christians,
a comedy tour.

2696
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,510
They were like bank loans.
Oh my God.

2697
01:59:22,511 --> 01:59:26,110
And they would call the corporate.
Went to arenas like big church arenas in

2698
01:59:26,111 --> 01:59:31,111
the south,
like giant fucking places and just 

2699
01:59:31,111 --> 01:59:31,260
terrible,
terrible happening.

2700
01:59:31,730 --> 01:59:33,610
He came in and said,
ma'am,

2701
01:59:33,611 --> 01:59:36,040
that's not my hat.
Seriously though,

2702
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,510
just really like,
you know,

2703
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:41,160
there's,
there's,

2704
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:43,830
there's a big push for that with a lot 
of people.

2705
01:59:43,831 --> 01:59:46,360
Like they want the lowest standard 
possible.

2706
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:48,160
You're gonna submit,
you're going to,

2707
01:59:48,410 --> 01:59:53,410
you're going to broadcast the lowest 
possible standard and there's so many 

2708
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:57,061
people that want to hear that,
whether it's in country music or at 

2709
01:59:57,061 --> 01:59:57,061
Sarah Pailin,
talking or it's you know,

2710
01:59:57,061 --> 01:59:57,790
they want,
they want no,

2711
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:01,450
no difference between you and them.
You are just as smart as them.

2712
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:03,280
You don't talk down.
In fact,

2713
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:08,430
you talk them up and make them out to be
much more than they really are and 

2714
02:00:08,430 --> 02:00:08,560
that's like a big,
if you're religious,

2715
02:00:08,590 --> 02:00:10,920
but for the grace of God or whatever,
they're getting through it,

2716
02:00:10,921 --> 02:00:15,921
click cool.
I've been so crazy and so spooky that 

2717
02:00:15,921 --> 02:00:19,200
we've gotten.
Our culture has made things so easy for 

2718
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,590
idiots to survive.
It's soap mean most of what Pr.

2719
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:23,440
There's so many people that do so many 
different things that are so useless and

2720
02:00:23,450 --> 02:00:24,880
they're going to be replaced by robots.

2721
02:00:25,910 --> 02:00:27,760
I'm a substance that Florida is what 
they watch,

2722
02:00:28,530 --> 02:00:29,640
the comedy concert.
He goes,

2723
02:00:29,850 --> 02:00:32,660
that was a worst Christian rock concert 
I've ever seen because it's ticket.

2724
02:00:32,661 --> 02:00:35,880
Simon says Chris Rock and he goes,
somebody f words.

2725
02:00:37,610 --> 02:00:38,840
That's hilarious.
Oh,

2726
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:39,810
that's hilarious.

2727
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:43,010
The Christian Russia.
That's hilarious.

2728
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:47,060
Yeah.
I just think it's so easy to be a retard

2729
02:00:47,061 --> 02:00:49,190
these days because there's so many other
people that you join with.

2730
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:54,460
Did you ever see the video?
There's a comic who interviewed these 

2731
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:56,090
people waiting to see Sarah Pailin at a 
book signing.

2732
02:00:56,570 --> 02:01:01,570
There was like a whole fucking giant 
line of people and it's like three 

2733
02:01:01,570 --> 02:01:05,741
degrees outside there,
freezing their asses off and they're 

2734
02:01:05,741 --> 02:01:05,870
waiting for hours to come in and meet 
Sarah Pailin and so the student goes and

2735
02:01:05,871 --> 02:01:10,871
interviews them and asks them questions.
What would you like about ms dot Ms Dot 

2736
02:01:10,871 --> 02:01:11,840
Palin policies?
It's all the same nonsense.

2737
02:01:11,841 --> 02:01:14,630
Nobody has a clue,
but in all fairness,

2738
02:01:14,631 --> 02:01:16,340
I've seen the same thing with Obama.
You know,

2739
02:01:16,341 --> 02:01:19,220
when they interviewed people that there 
is no,

2740
02:01:19,221 --> 02:01:22,850
he's black and he's talking to really 
good and he's good.

2741
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:25,410
He went to the thing with,
I think it was bob

2742
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:28,240
or stuttering John Thompson.
I might've turned out,

2743
02:01:28,250 --> 02:01:30,080
but they went with someone else 
completely,

2744
02:01:30,110 --> 02:01:33,570
but they went downtown and asks about,
um,

2745
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:39,040
what do you think about Obama?
What do you think was running mates 

2746
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:39,040
therapy when people are gone?
I think she's great.

2747
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:39,380
I think it was great.
Who Do you,

2748
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:39,980
are you a Democrat

2749
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:40,910
or Republican?
The Republican,

2750
02:01:40,911 --> 02:01:42,050
and they're like,
what about,

2751
02:01:42,051 --> 02:01:44,390
you know,
like that forever.

2752
02:01:44,391 --> 02:01:49,391
I watched that Gonzo,
that Thompson back in the 19 seventies 

2753
02:01:50,061 --> 02:01:53,030
when he was running fewer loading on the
campaign trail was the same thing.

2754
02:01:53,031 --> 02:01:55,340
They were asking all these different 
people and who you're voting for it.

2755
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:58,990
No one had a fucking clue why anybody.
No,

2756
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,490
not that guy.
No,

2757
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:01,670
not that guy.
And I was like,

2758
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:04,220
who the fuck are you voting for?
And that guy's vote counts.

2759
02:02:04,230 --> 02:02:06,530
Just as much scholar.
Yeah.

2760
02:02:06,531 --> 02:02:11,531
They like Obama.
So you know he wants to go to war with 

2761
02:02:11,531 --> 02:02:13,871
Iraq war.
How do we feel about that as well for 

2762
02:02:13,871 --> 02:02:13,871
it?
What do you.

2763
02:02:13,871 --> 02:02:15,770
Do you think that there Obama has any 
say or do you think it's all horseshit?

2764
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:18,020
What do you think literally happens when
you.

2765
02:02:18,021 --> 02:02:23,021
When do you think that you've been 
briefed before the editor when I said 

2766
02:02:23,021 --> 02:02:24,140
this is what's going to happen,
you're going to be given an agenda.

2767
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:27,230
You're going to be asked to follow 
certain protocol.

2768
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:32,350
You'll you will consult with these 
people before any decision before any 

2769
02:02:32,350 --> 02:02:32,390
press conference.
It will be reviewed.

2770
02:02:33,410 --> 02:02:38,410
Some of that,
but I think they're also just met with 

2771
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:41,650
with checks and balances.
It's way harder to get things done when 

2772
02:02:41,650 --> 02:02:42,590
you think you don't have to make 
allegiances and you have to give certain

2773
02:02:42,591 --> 02:02:44,300
things in order to get.
Definitely,

2774
02:02:44,310 --> 02:02:45,440
you know,
definitely.

2775
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:47,170
There's definitely a lot of that.
There's definitely a lot.

2776
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:48,680
We'll just get something done.
It's not that easy.

2777
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:50,240
No,
no it's not but.

2778
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:55,390
But okay,
but what's with him saying that he 

2779
02:02:55,390 --> 02:02:57,911
wanted.
It was all bullshit that you don't want 

2780
02:02:57,911 --> 02:02:57,911
to have troops over there and then all 
of a sudden he pulls them out of our ach

2781
02:02:57,911 --> 02:02:59,450
and sends him off to Afghanistan.
What does that all.

2782
02:02:59,451 --> 02:03:00,950
Because I think she realized like,
Oh,

2783
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:06,280
I can't just pull them out so it creates
a vacuum of power that will be terrible 

2784
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:06,280
and what I wanted to do.

2785
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:08,790
Now I know more than what it does.
You know what?

2786
02:03:08,810 --> 02:03:11,390
I think what they've gotta do at some 
point in time,

2787
02:03:11,391 --> 02:03:16,391
they've got to have some map.
If they really want to get people to 

2788
02:03:16,391 --> 02:03:17,570
like the United States and other 
countries,

2789
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:22,720
there has to be some massive goodwill 
operation where we go to these 

2790
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:26,951
impoverished countries,
these places that had been wrecked by 

2791
02:03:26,951 --> 02:03:26,951
war,
by devastation,

2792
02:03:26,951 --> 02:03:31,061
by all these different things that are 
going on and we have to help the fuck 

2793
02:03:31,061 --> 02:03:33,731
out of them because if we don't do that,
then other people are going to look at 

2794
02:03:33,731 --> 02:03:33,731
us and go,
what?

2795
02:03:33,731 --> 02:03:37,551
What is,
why would we look up to the United 

2796
02:03:37,551 --> 02:03:40,210
States just because it used to be just 
because it's the biggest super power 

2797
02:03:40,210 --> 02:03:40,210
because they have the most missiles,
you know,

2798
02:03:40,210 --> 02:03:43,370
why would we give a fuck about them?
And if the people at the very top aren't

2799
02:03:43,371 --> 02:03:48,371
the most generous than the whole,
the whole system below you seems unfair 

2800
02:03:48,371 --> 02:03:48,680
and people get fucking pissed off.

2801
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:52,490
Something that Old Testament or a light 
unto the nations,

2802
02:03:53,570 --> 02:03:55,460
you know,
lead by example of what you want them to

2803
02:03:55,461 --> 02:03:56,120
do.
Sure.

2804
02:03:56,121 --> 02:04:01,121
If you're in that position,
if you're in the position to be 

2805
02:04:01,121 --> 02:04:01,121
generous,
if you're in the position to help,

2806
02:04:01,121 --> 02:04:02,630
if you're in the present,
it's just we're just ganking shit.

2807
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:04,490
That's the problem.
We want the oil.

2808
02:04:04,491 --> 02:04:09,491
Fuck you.
Give us that natural socket and we're 

2809
02:04:09,491 --> 02:04:09,491
going to go,
where's those poppy seeds?

2810
02:04:09,491 --> 02:04:09,920
Where's the heroin ground?
Right here.

2811
02:04:09,950 --> 02:04:14,950
Shut the fuck up and sit down.
We're bringing in guns and tanks and 

2812
02:04:14,950 --> 02:04:18,881
fucking jets and we're going to have 
space ships that fly around you by 

2813
02:04:18,881 --> 02:04:19,790
remote control and shoot missiles into 
canyons.

2814
02:04:20,850 --> 02:04:22,520
Dude,
you ever watch those videos online?

2815
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:26,110
They have videos of them launching 
missiles from like helicopters and shit.

2816
02:04:26,111 --> 02:04:28,100
If these people that are walking with 
donkeys,

2817
02:04:28,550 --> 02:04:30,080
I mean it's fucking nuts,
man.

2818
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:33,380
Walk in.
You seem like walking up the hill.

2819
02:04:33,381 --> 02:04:34,250
I went,
got to target.

2820
02:04:34,490 --> 02:04:37,900
Should we engage when you see it like 
his arms?

2821
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:40,680
Who knows whenever the fuck knows what 
they're doing.

2822
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:41,360
I mean,
you know,

2823
02:04:41,370 --> 02:04:46,370
it could have been.
Somebody just said the wrong thing to 

2824
02:04:46,370 --> 02:04:46,370
some fucking general.
Who knows?

2825
02:04:46,370 --> 02:04:46,370
I don't know what they did.
I mean I'm just watching a video.

2826
02:04:46,370 --> 02:04:51,170
It could be that there are some high 
level operatives and are moving through 

2827
02:04:51,170 --> 02:04:54,201
their secret cave hideouts and who the 
fuck the house John Heffrons watching 

2828
02:04:54,201 --> 02:04:56,370
Prophet John Ron.
That was the.

2829
02:04:56,500 --> 02:05:01,260
I also the comedy club at skyline comedy
in class.

2830
02:05:01,420 --> 02:05:04,960
What are you saying?
Skyline comedy club is watching and they

2831
02:05:04,961 --> 02:05:06,300
were like,
come to Appleton,

2832
02:05:06,380 --> 02:05:06,950
Wisconsin.

2833
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:14,420
Where is John Heffernan playing next?
I've only been to Wisconsin once and 

2834
02:05:14,420 --> 02:05:16,560
went to some crazy summer festival.
Yeah,

2835
02:05:16,630 --> 02:05:18,590
it was awesome.
It was an outside of the 10th.

2836
02:05:18,610 --> 02:05:19,950
Thousands of people.
Awesome.

2837
02:05:20,050 --> 02:05:20,810
Outside.
Yeah,

2838
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:25,820
it was really great crowd and.
But it was like a lot of people with 

2839
02:05:25,820 --> 02:05:25,820
babies and shit and I'm saying,
oh,

2840
02:05:25,820 --> 02:05:26,850
it's nasty shit.
I'm like,

2841
02:05:26,851 --> 02:05:28,380
I'm sorry.
It was on.

2842
02:05:28,381 --> 02:05:31,800
Bother me nearly as much like yeah,
there was kids too,

2843
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:33,720
man.
There was everybody and I was.

2844
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:36,480
I did all my shit because there was a 
lot of young people in the front,

2845
02:05:36,481 --> 02:05:40,710
like a majority was like hundreds and 
hundreds of young people and then behind

2846
02:05:40,711 --> 02:05:42,660
them there was like a mixed bag,
but the people that were sitting,

2847
02:05:42,661 --> 02:05:43,920
we're all like,
you know,

2848
02:05:43,921 --> 02:05:46,710
your average comedy club audience.
There was just a bunch of people outside

2849
02:05:46,711 --> 02:05:51,711
and the people are standing up and 
walking around and it's in a big giant 

2850
02:05:51,711 --> 02:05:51,711
tent.
It was so strange,

2851
02:05:51,711 --> 02:05:52,680
but I'll do it once because I was too 
dirty.

2852
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:56,910
They will not have any back.
John Heffrons in Atlanta.

2853
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:59,520
Where's the punchline?
Punchline.

2854
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:01,260
Prophet John Safran.
Very,

2855
02:06:01,261 --> 02:06:02,770
very funny guy.
Funny.

2856
02:06:02,860 --> 02:06:04,590
Every time I say him,
we'll see him.

2857
02:06:06,990 --> 02:06:09,210
John heffrons ready to come to Arizona.
Well,

2858
02:06:09,211 --> 02:06:14,211
I think John will tell you that he would
love to come to Arizona if the improv 

2859
02:06:14,211 --> 02:06:16,440
comes with the shackles.
You know what I'm saying?

2860
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:18,000
You gotta come with the shackles from my
man.

2861
02:06:18,001 --> 02:06:23,001
John headphone.
So what do you think about a little 

2862
02:06:23,001 --> 02:06:23,001
wayne?
Wayne went to jail.

2863
02:06:23,001 --> 02:06:23,970
Well,
it's about time.

2864
02:06:24,250 --> 02:06:28,550
Do you think so?
Just another one already.

2865
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:31,710
Little rapids.
He has crazy tattooed up.

2866
02:06:31,711 --> 02:06:33,700
Have you seen how much he's whole body's
done?

2867
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:38,710
Yeah.
We've got to put that online for people 

2868
02:06:38,710 --> 02:06:38,710
who haven't seen it because it's fucking
bizarre.

2869
02:06:38,710 --> 02:06:40,590
Like it's so crazy.
Like it's hard to believe that this dude

2870
02:06:40,591 --> 02:06:43,140
has this many tattoos.
I mean,

2871
02:06:43,141 --> 02:06:48,141
like this whole body's fucking tattoo.
Oh,

2872
02:06:49,610 --> 02:06:51,160
ready to wrap it?
Shut the fuck up.

2873
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:55,080
We will give a little wayne tattoos.
Need some coffee song.

2874
02:06:55,590 --> 02:06:57,040
I got so much.
Six to.

2875
02:06:57,350 --> 02:06:59,320
What do you ever do have to get a 
macy's?

2876
02:06:59,430 --> 02:07:00,720
Okay,
sounds hard.

2877
02:07:00,810 --> 02:07:03,960
What are you going to do that right 
away?

2878
02:07:03,961 --> 02:07:06,060
I would never trade lives with you right
off the bat.

2879
02:07:06,061 --> 02:07:08,430
That just sounds so horrible.
There was no way.

2880
02:07:08,431 --> 02:07:11,530
I wish that upon my worst enemy.
I've got amazing.

2881
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:12,540
Amazing.

2882
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:16,340
It's hard to find a new one.
Oh,

2883
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:17,790
here's a good one.
Here's a good one.

2884
02:07:18,550 --> 02:07:20,490
God Damn.
This students got a lot of tensors.

2885
02:07:20,860 --> 02:07:23,320
Look at this shit.
Oh my God.

02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:26,230
That's incredible.
Cast money.

2887
02:07:26,650 --> 02:07:30,010
Yeah.
This is incredible.

2888
02:07:31,390 --> 02:07:36,010
He's in a position where it really just 
doesn't matter because it's not going to

2889
02:07:36,011 --> 02:07:37,020
get a job.
Yeah.

2890
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:38,410
Well,
he doesn't have to be right

2891
02:07:38,540 --> 02:07:41,070

man.

2892
02:07:41,071 --> 02:07:43,980
That's nuts.
I'll put this up on to it.

2893
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:55,600
That's crazy,
man.

2894
02:07:56,150 --> 02:07:58,060
He just went off and tattooed his whole 
body.

2895
02:07:58,170 --> 02:08:00,060
That's like a big good all at once.
No,

2896
02:08:00,220 --> 02:08:00,920
I don't know,
man.

2897

Soldier boy seems to have that.
Soulja boy do.

2898

Do the same thing.
Tattooed his face.

2899
02:08:05,371 --> 02:08:07,560
Tattooed his hands,
tattooed his chest.

2900
02:08:07,561 --> 02:08:09,510
His whole arms is.
I mean,

2901
02:08:09,511 --> 02:08:11,640
he just went nutty.
If you're googling soldier boy,

2902
02:08:11,641 --> 02:08:13,140
you can't find it.
You're spelling it wrong.

2903
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:16,030
Yeah.
It's like a soldier.

2904
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:21,200
Slu l j a hollow and also Google a 
soldier boy.

2905

Ice Cream.
Kitty ice cream.

02:08:24,421 --> 02:08:25,230
Kidding?
Yeah.

2907
02:08:26,070 --> 02:08:27,050
Powerful show.
Fear.

2908

So for you got to unblock me for me.
Twitter.

2909
02:08:28,861 --> 02:08:32,160
Don't be rude.
I can't even follow you on that road.

2910
02:08:32,430 --> 02:08:37,430
It goes both fucking bug me too much.
We can read it right now.

2911
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:40,620
We could still read it.
Just have to go support.

2912
02:08:40,950 --> 02:08:45,950
I promise I won't bug you anymore,
but it still lets you just go to your 

2913
02:08:45,950 --> 02:08:45,950
will.

2914
02:08:45,950 --> 02:08:48,000
You know,
go to the website.

2915
02:08:48,001 --> 02:08:49,310
Yeah.
Up a stream.

2916
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:51,670
No,
not on Dennis tweet deck,

2917
02:08:51,910 --> 02:08:53,500
but we can always go to your page to see
what you're up to.

2918
02:08:53,650 --> 02:08:54,640
No,
come on man,

2919
02:08:55,360 --> 02:09:00,360
but you can't fuck with me.
When I was about wanting to commit 

2920
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:02,671
suicide,
I won't fuck with you about anything 

2921
02:09:02,671 --> 02:09:03,040
anymore.
You don't really want to commit suicide.

2922
02:09:03,050 --> 02:09:04,950
We just want to be happier.
Right.

2923
02:09:05,010 --> 02:09:06,450
Would you rather if you have the two 
options,

2924
02:09:07,910 --> 02:09:08,870
right?
Well that's like,

2925
02:09:08,871 --> 02:09:10,420
so you don't really want to throw the 
question on passage.

2926
02:09:10,421 --> 02:09:14,730
Went away however I get there.
It's not like that.

2927
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:17,010
It's like that.
It's not like that at all,

2928
02:09:17,030 --> 02:09:18,410
Lou.
That's nice and gamble.

2929
02:09:18,530 --> 02:09:20,620
That's what little wayne has to say 
about it.

2930
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:22,760
This whole lot bodies like a fortune 
cookie.

2931
02:09:24,290 --> 02:09:26,660
He's got little unfortunate to be 
sayings all over his body.

2932
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:29,080
Wow.
That's so weird.

2933
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:36,340
That's like really fucking really bad 
tattoos,

2934
02:09:36,341 --> 02:09:37,260
man.

2935
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:44,020
It's weird.
That's a see a real trend that guys are 

2936
02:09:44,020 --> 02:09:45,650
getting these really bad.
It's like prison tattoos.

2937
02:09:45,830 --> 02:09:46,730
But the crazy thing is,
you know,

2938
02:09:46,731 --> 02:09:47,610
it comes from self,
a gangster,

2939
02:09:47,611 --> 02:09:52,611
all this crazy shit,
but he goes to jail and the first thing 

2940
02:09:52,611 --> 02:09:52,611
you did was go into protective custody.

2941
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:53,950
Oh.
Because they're afraid of.

2942
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:56,540
How did you do that?
You just apply.

2943
02:09:57,030 --> 02:09:58,550
Um,
that's a good question man.

2944
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:03,140
I had a head of time,
like when you get the camera and say,

2945
02:10:03,141 --> 02:10:07,720
my client is a very wealthy man who,
you know,

2946
02:10:07,730 --> 02:10:09,740
a lot of people could get a name off,
beating him up.

2947
02:10:09,741 --> 02:10:12,180
He's not a very big man and he's 
concerned for her safety.

2948
02:10:12,290 --> 02:10:17,290
My favorite things is when it is like us
to walk through the law and what we 

2949
02:10:17,481 --> 02:10:19,370
would say to the judge in order to get 
things done.

2950
02:10:20,300 --> 02:10:25,300
We're only going off old law.
There were sort of guessing old 

2951
02:10:25,300 --> 02:10:30,100
episodes.
I think what you have to do is tell the 

2952
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:30,100
judge,
your honor,

2953
02:10:30,180 --> 02:10:34,630
I don't even know what to monitor when 
TV shows have you that you could tell it

2954
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:37,370
like if a cop was like undercover cops,
you'd say,

2955
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:39,260
are you a cop?
And they have to tell you the truth.

2956
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:44,030
I'm a cop.
She taught me that off this time lefty,

2957
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:49,200
but next time you already,
you know you guys are never going to 

2958
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:50,840
trick me like what?
They would never do that.

2959
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:52,610
They don't have to tell you they're 
cops.

2960
02:10:52,611 --> 02:10:54,410
That's ridiculous.
You're doing something illegal.

2961
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:58,160
A cop can let you do that illegal shit.
They can do illegal shit with you.

2962
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:01,430
They can do fucking cocaine with you to 
arrest you for cocaine.

2963
02:11:01,431 --> 02:11:06,431
How about that?
It's legal and they can get away with 

2964
02:11:06,431 --> 02:11:06,431
it.
You know how many is that?

2965
02:11:06,431 --> 02:11:10,630
Because if they go under cover,
they're going to have to do drugs with 

2966
02:11:10,630 --> 02:11:10,630
you.
If you're doing drugs and you want to be

2967
02:11:10,630 --> 02:11:12,320
a part of some motorcycle gang,
the motorcycle gangs,

2968
02:11:12,321 --> 02:11:13,300
doing drugs,
you got to.

2969
02:11:13,350 --> 02:11:14,580
Drugs will not be able to,
but yeah,

2970
02:11:14,581 --> 02:11:19,581
I'm on TV.
They'll dump it off the side or the one 

2971
02:11:19,581 --> 02:11:19,581
special episode where they had to do it.

2972
02:11:19,581 --> 02:11:20,360
Yes,
exactly.

2973
02:11:20,420 --> 02:11:22,550
They throw their fake it on amazing 
stuff.

2974
02:11:22,590 --> 02:11:27,590
I'll give you an antidote pill.
This will immediately notify the 

2975
02:11:27,590 --> 02:11:29,891
cocaine.
So as soon as you take it and make your 

2976
02:11:29,891 --> 02:11:30,860
way into the bathroom.
Almost gotten credit for job interviews.

2977
02:11:30,861 --> 02:11:31,850
Yeah,
exactly.

2978
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:36,880
I mean it's just.
You hear about that all the time with 

2979
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:40,211
dea agents,
the DEA agents get addicted to drugs 

2980
02:11:40,211 --> 02:11:42,911
because they have to do with these 
fucking people to get in with them and 

2981
02:11:42,911 --> 02:11:43,210
then also I think they just see that 
fucking lifestyle.

2982
02:11:43,220 --> 02:11:48,220
They become crazy.
They see how many people are getting 

2983
02:11:48,220 --> 02:11:50,291
away with it.
I think if you were in the position to 

2984
02:11:50,291 --> 02:11:50,750
really be investigating drugs in this 
country,

2985
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:52,760
you would see there's so much trucks 
coming in.

2986
02:11:52,761 --> 02:11:55,400
It's like an unstopped before he would 
start wondering like,

2987
02:11:55,430 --> 02:11:56,900
what are we putting our resources 
towards?

2988
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:58,190
Why isn't this shit legal?

2989
02:11:58,190 --> 02:11:59,990
Where they can tax it and make money off
of it.

2990
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:02,000
You know,
why can't they just go after the illegal

2991
02:12:02,001 --> 02:12:03,890
people there?
It's just like prohibition.

2992
02:12:04,130 --> 02:12:05,930
When prohibition happened in the 
thirties,

2993
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:07,640
all that shit did,
or the twenties,

2994
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:13,140
it was like what?
Like 1933 or something that all it did 

2995
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:15,500
was just made people that were more 
dangerous sell.

2996
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:17,930
It made people that weren't afraid to 
break the law.

2997
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:23,050
It just made organized crime strong.
They kept a lot of people's hands and 

2998
02:12:23,050 --> 02:12:24,890
most of my stuff,
I don't know man.

2999
02:12:24,891 --> 02:12:27,890
I think it made people angry about 
getting busted with it and selling it,

3000
02:12:27,891 --> 02:12:29,500
but I think most people want to get 
drunk.

3001
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:32,300
I kind of aren't going to break the law 
rather risk it,

3002
02:12:32,410 --> 02:12:33,860
you know,
because a lot of people who are like,

3003
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:35,080
oh,
I guess we can have it anymore.

3004
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:37,540
I mean,
did you ever research or just speculate?

3005
02:12:37,580 --> 02:12:39,980
I'm just speculating,
but if they made cigarettes illegal,

3006
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:45,010
completely illegal.
There's a lot of people will start to 

3007
02:12:45,010 --> 02:12:46,960
wonder if it would be like Catholic 
school girls and being horse because 

3008
02:12:48,060 --> 02:12:50,460
there's a disproportion amount.
Say some.

3009
02:12:50,630 --> 02:12:52,400
Growing up around a lot of Catholic 
school girls,

3010
02:12:52,401 --> 02:12:55,700
it was common knowledge amongst my 
friends that Catholic school girls,

3011
02:12:55,730 --> 02:12:59,210
they go religious Jewish school,
not.

3012
02:12:59,510 --> 02:13:04,510
Well.
I think Catholicism is so ridiculous 

3013
02:13:04,510 --> 02:13:07,180
that I think even like the,
when you're dealing with a religion 

3014
02:13:07,180 --> 02:13:11,351
where a gigantic percentage of the men 
who are in power are fucking little 

3015
02:13:11,351 --> 02:13:12,650
kids.
The other one got caught.

3016
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:16,640
I said it was good.
It's another anti gay rights.

3017
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:17,100
Oh No,
no.

3018
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:18,220
That was Roy Ashburn.
Yeah,

3019
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:23,300
that was the guy who is.
He was the guy driving proposition 

3020
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:23,300
eight.
He got caught.

3021
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:23,660
He admitted he was gay,
but that guy's not a priest.

3022
02:13:23,661 --> 02:13:24,530
He's not fucking kids.

3023
02:13:24,530 --> 02:13:25,800
He's just gay.
You're like,

3024
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:30,820
they're all the same fucking pedophiles.
You loved this guy in with a pedophile.

3025
02:13:31,490 --> 02:13:33,460
Would that religion is so ridiculous 
that there's.

3026
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:38,640
There's a giant percentage of the men 
who are pushing this religion are also 

3027
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:40,860
fucking horrible pedophiles that ruin 
people's lives.

3028
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:44,130
If you know anybody that's Catholic,
if you grew up in a Catholic community,

3029
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:46,350
you know a bunch of people that have 
been molested.

3030
02:13:46,590 --> 02:13:51,590
Everybody knows somebody.
I know two people that got hit on by 

3031
02:13:51,590 --> 02:13:52,680
priests.
I know my friend Tony,

3032
02:13:52,681 --> 02:13:56,490
he had a fight off a priest and my 
friend John had to fight off a priest.

3033
02:13:56,880 --> 02:14:01,880
They get attacked,
his priests fucking drool on them and 

3034
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:02,670
breathe on and pull the end.
My friend bought another dude.

3035
02:14:02,671 --> 02:14:03,540
I know three dudes.
I know.

3036
02:14:03,541 --> 02:14:05,090
Three dudes that got a.
they're all Catholic.

3037
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:07,230
No girl.
That money from a settlement.

3038
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:09,210
Dude,
there's so many settlements.

3039
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:14,210
If you stop and look,
do you know New Mexico has some crazy 

3040
02:14:14,210 --> 02:14:17,241
ass fucking law or they used to at one 
point in time where you could if you had

3041
02:14:17,431 --> 02:14:19,680
sex with a girl,
like a man cannot have sex.

3042
02:14:19,681 --> 02:14:22,620
We grow like it's normal age.
The age of consent was like 18,

3043
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:26,670
but if a man to have sex with a boy,
the age of consent was like 13.

3044
02:14:27,090 --> 02:14:29,370
Really?
It's fucking crazy.

3045
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:31,920
And the reason why supposedly this was 
inactive,

3046
02:14:31,970 --> 02:14:35,040
so the Catholic church put pressure on 
them to keep this in place that they can

3047
02:14:35,041 --> 02:14:40,030
fucking ship all their sweet boy ass and
they would sneak it.

3048
02:14:40,080 --> 02:14:41,910
I don't know if this is true.
This is all speculation.

3049
02:14:41,911 --> 02:14:45,810
This is all in the Internet faculty.
The fact that speculation,

3050
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:50,190
the fact is that the age of consent for 
male to boy was 13.

3051
02:14:50,430 --> 02:14:51,680
That's fucking nuts,
man.

3052
02:14:51,710 --> 02:14:53,340
Same sex males is like 13.

3053
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:55,740
Whereas opposite sex like boys and 
girls,

3054
02:14:56,190 --> 02:15:01,190
what's really crazy now is the sexting 
thing where kids are going to jail for 

3055
02:15:01,190 --> 02:15:01,820
child pornography because they're taking
a picture.

3056
02:15:02,500 --> 02:15:04,130
They really.
They came down at some point with like a

3057
02:15:04,140 --> 02:15:05,790
no tolerance.
I don't care if you've made it,

3058
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:08,950
but you can't have on your hard drive.
No one can have a well there.

3059
02:15:09,010 --> 02:15:11,100
Those laws like we can make an exception
for anyone.

3060
02:15:11,150 --> 02:15:15,390
They are attacking slots for,
for sending pictures of their pussy.

3061
02:15:15,391 --> 02:15:18,690
Two guys,
they're attacking silly.

3062
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:21,990
It's basically the same thing.
I'll show you mine.

3063
02:15:22,100 --> 02:15:24,720
It all played that when we were kids,
but then the problem is then it gets out

3064
02:15:24,721 --> 02:15:26,420
to fucking pedophile for maximum go 
crazy.

3065
02:15:26,430 --> 02:15:31,430
That's what they said.
They didn't want anyone to have it at 

3066
02:15:31,430 --> 02:15:31,430
this twice.
So we're talking about again,

3067
02:15:31,430 --> 02:15:33,630
the point is send us some sweet pictures
of a 13 year old Bush.

3068
02:15:33,830 --> 02:15:37,780
This is important shit because it's 
fascinating.

3069
02:15:43,530 --> 02:15:48,530
It's fascinating shit man.
The idea that you can put kids in jail 

3070
02:15:48,530 --> 02:15:48,530
because they take pictures of their 
pussy,

3071
02:15:48,810 --> 02:15:53,810
you know,
the dude's sends a picture of his Dick 

3072
02:15:53,810 --> 02:15:53,810
to some girl in schools now.
Now he's locked in a cage.

3073
02:15:53,810 --> 02:15:53,810
You know,
that's silly.

3074
02:15:54,120 --> 02:15:57,140
People throughout time it's,
there's a charge in whipping your decap.

3075
02:15:57,270 --> 02:15:59,450
If you cover someone's Dick up,
they're gonna want to whip it out.

3076
02:16:00,010 --> 02:16:01,770
We all lived naked and free.
You know,

3077
02:16:01,771 --> 02:16:02,970
he wouldn't have to worry about this 
shit.

3078
02:16:03,710 --> 02:16:05,190
Then people would start fucking way 
earlier.

3079
02:16:07,650 --> 02:16:12,650
We all live naked and free.
You wouldn't be able to trust anybody 

3080
02:16:12,650 --> 02:16:12,650
ever where someone will actually fucked 
by accident would have to happen.

3081
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:15,640
I'm wondering how much suppression,
you know,

3082
02:16:15,810 --> 02:16:19,050
we really have by walking around naked,
like how much different we would we'd be

3083
02:16:19,051 --> 02:16:20,570
if we walked around naked.
You know,

3084
02:16:20,690 --> 02:16:22,080
I'm walking around all closed up.

3085
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:24,390
I wonder how much more different I 
behavior that will tell you this.

3086
02:16:24,680 --> 02:16:28,220
This is the comparison.
Is that so any sort of nudity is like a.

3087
02:16:28,270 --> 02:16:30,840
It was like a novelty when I was showing
a gear.

3088
02:16:30,850 --> 02:16:32,410
When I went to touch women,
you know,

3089
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:34,840
when I would touch them even on the arm 
or something like,

3090
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:37,170
oh yeah,
it was like an electric sort of feel the

3091
02:16:37,171 --> 02:16:42,171
other way more sexual.
So I think covering up and stopping 

3092
02:16:42,171 --> 02:16:44,161
yourself,
it makes you more sexual so that if you 

3093
02:16:44,161 --> 02:16:44,161
were completely unclothed you'd be way 
calmer.

3094
02:16:44,161 --> 02:16:44,690
Makes it more urgent.
Yeah.

3095
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:47,950
When I first came to La and our first 
acted in a sitcom,

3096
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:49,790
I didn't like being here.
I didn't like this.

3097
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:54,820
The sick,
the whole say comp situation was really 

3098
02:16:54,820 --> 02:16:54,820
bad.
A lot of negative energy that said a lot

3099
02:16:54,820 --> 02:16:57,120
of fighting going on in the network and 
the producers and the writers and uh,

3100
02:16:57,150 --> 02:17:00,190
I'd broken up with my girlfriend and I 
moved out here and we were still talking

3101
02:17:00,191 --> 02:17:00,980
about home,
but I didn't,

3102
02:17:01,180 --> 02:17:02,290
I didn't know anybody here.

3103
02:17:02,290 --> 02:17:04,390
And I was out here for a few weeks.
I didn't talk to anybody,

3104
02:17:04,410 --> 02:17:06,850
didn't hang out with anybody.
And then this chick,

3105
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:12,270
we were laughing about something.
She gave me a hug on the set and she 

3106
02:17:12,270 --> 02:17:12,790
gave me a hug and it was the best 
feeling in the world.

3107
02:17:12,970 --> 02:17:15,410
It wasn't like a regular hug.
She hit me with his hobby.

3108
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:16,930
I was like,
it was like I needed it.

3109
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,860
Like she gave me a glass of water,
like,

3110
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:21,580
you know,
and it was just a hug man.

3111
02:17:21,581 --> 02:17:25,390
She's just being nice and she gave me a 
nice hug and rub my back and I was like,

3112
02:17:25,391 --> 02:17:26,770
wow,
that felt so good.

3113
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:29,580
I just felt you need that human contact.
Yeah,

3114
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:32,110
if you go like a few weeks or a month 
without touching anybody,

3115
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:34,960
that guy that we were talking about 
earlier that lives in the Arctic,

3116
02:17:35,170 --> 02:17:35,900
he went,
uh,

3117
02:17:35,950 --> 02:17:39,010
I think eight months at one point by 
himself just up there hunting.

3118
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:40,900
And he said it was way too much.
He said he went crazy.

3119
02:17:41,790 --> 02:17:43,810
That guys just live in wild man.
You got to see it.

3120
02:17:43,811 --> 02:17:46,590
Some VBS TV,
I think his name is Heinemann high,

3121
02:17:46,630 --> 02:17:50,560
most Arctic refuge.
Just look up Arctic VBS DOT TV.

3122
02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:51,940
It's fucking incredible,
man.

3123
02:17:51,941 --> 02:17:53,710
Like one of the most incredible 
documentaries ever.

3124
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:57,820
You stopped to think about it like this 
guy has chosen to live like that in this

3125
02:17:57,820 --> 02:18:02,820
day and age.
Whereas we think if we had to live like 

3126
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:02,820
that will be hell.
Like Brian,

3127
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:06,511
how do you think you would feel if like 
all of a sudden civilization dropped 

3128
02:18:06,511 --> 02:18:06,580
off,
there was no power and you had a fucking

3129
02:18:06,730 --> 02:18:11,730
light fires with wood and kill animals 
to stay alive and it was fucking 

3130
02:18:12,011 --> 02:18:13,570
freezing cold out and you were an 
animal.

3131
02:18:14,060 --> 02:18:15,460
Shit.
That's what I need.

3132
02:18:15,670 --> 02:18:20,670
I couldn't live on top of a mountain.
I couldn't be like that because that 

3133
02:18:20,670 --> 02:18:20,670
shit didn't happen.

3134
02:18:20,670 --> 02:18:21,580
I don't want to be on top of a mountain 
it all by myself.

3135
02:18:21,581 --> 02:18:26,581
I want to be around civilization,
around civilization.

3136
02:18:27,010 --> 02:18:28,900
There's no food.
No one's growing anything.

3137
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:32,500
There's a lot of mooches and chaos.
Want to see some more self sustaining,

3138
02:18:32,501 --> 02:18:33,110
right?
Yeah.

3139
02:18:33,170 --> 02:18:35,200
But I mean it's.
I think it's like,

3140
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:38,560
I mean my family grew up on farm,
so to me it's just like,

3141
02:18:38,590 --> 02:18:39,880
wow,
what if some food,

3142
02:18:39,881 --> 02:18:41,120
you know,
I think by,

3143
02:18:42,700 --> 02:18:44,080
you know,
by the time if he runs out,

3144
02:18:44,081 --> 02:18:45,460
we'll have tomatoes,
we'll have,

3145
02:18:45,550 --> 02:18:47,950
you know,
you have to have a serious work ethic to

3146
02:18:47,951 --> 02:18:49,900
run a farm so you can't slack off at 
three weeks.

3147
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:54,960
I didn't know anything about farms until
I started working for the UFC and then 

3148
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:58,381
you start talking to the,
a real pharmacy and I'll talk to Matt 

3149
02:18:58,381 --> 02:19:01,300
Hughes and all these guys are,
when they do like a in depth reports,

3150
02:19:01,301 --> 02:19:02,620
are these guys in their life,
you know,

3151
02:19:02,621 --> 02:19:07,621
Tommy Spears and another one,
like they offered him a fight recently 

3152
02:19:07,621 --> 02:19:08,260
and he couldn't take the fight because 
he was in the middle of the harvest.

3153
02:19:08,480 --> 02:19:09,240
What else?
Like,

3154
02:19:09,730 --> 02:19:10,830
that's real shit.
You know,

3155
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:15,840
these guys,
they're out there working hard working 

3156
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:15,840
man.
They're working all day,

3157
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:17,830
every day and it's brutal.
It's hard work.

3158
02:19:17,950 --> 02:19:21,910
And there's a mentality that a lot of 
these guys love the work.

3159
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:24,790
There is something,
something very satisfying.

3160
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:25,710
Something,
you know,

3161
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:28,730
that goes back to our days when we first
discovered agriculture,

3162
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,740
you know,
it's like a visceral Schumann,

3163
02:19:30,741 --> 02:19:35,741
reactional you get,
you feel rewarded for having produced 

3164
02:19:35,741 --> 02:19:36,790
all this food as a family.
That juice shit.

3165
02:19:37,290 --> 02:19:39,680
There's a fable that God,
because he loves his children,

3166
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:44,920
um,
gave us a plentiful cattle and crops 

3167
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:48,941
without us having to work for it at all.
And the man went crazy and started 

3168
02:19:48,941 --> 02:19:49,970
working on itself was so then he took 
that power away.

3169
02:19:49,971 --> 02:19:52,490
Then you had to actually toilet soil and
then people were waiting for calmer.

3170
02:19:53,410 --> 02:19:56,170
What are you doing?
Why are you in planning?

3171
02:19:56,680 --> 02:19:58,650
I've got to take off.
Take off too.

3172
02:19:59,110 --> 02:20:04,110
Don't just unplug the battery charge.
Calm Down Joe.

3173
02:20:05,430 --> 02:20:07,510
Um,
I don't remember what we're just talking

3174
02:20:07,511 --> 02:20:09,530
about.
What would you start about?

3175
02:20:09,550 --> 02:20:14,180
Brand farms and that's why hunting this 
Guy Chemo,

3176
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:16,180
I think that's his name that lived in 
the Arctic.

3177
02:20:16,181 --> 02:20:21,181
That's why he was talking about how 
satisfying it is to be a hunter and 

3178
02:20:21,181 --> 02:20:21,181
gatherer.
You know,

3179
02:20:21,181 --> 02:20:23,290
that he thinks that that's where 
civilization fell apart.

3180
02:20:23,470 --> 02:20:26,230
That man is most happy when he's out 
there providing for himself.

3181
02:20:26,231 --> 02:20:28,000
He says he loves it.
He loves living up there.

3182
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:30,280
Just hunting and fishing and getting 
food that way.

3183
02:20:30,310 --> 02:20:31,150
It makes them happy.
It's like,

3184
02:20:31,151 --> 02:20:31,960
fuck it.
Go for it.

3185
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,330
Yes.
Maybe there's something to it though.

3186
02:20:34,331 --> 02:20:36,520
Maybe if you did it too,
it'd be like ultra stimulating.

3187
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:38,680
I mean,
I think that's one of everything.

3188
02:20:38,710 --> 02:20:41,110
Everybody's different situations that 
other people wouldn't,

3189
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:43,460
but he's doing like natural exercise 
every day.

3190
02:20:43,540 --> 02:20:46,460
Everyday is hiking and he's shooting 
Caribou and he's dragging.

3191
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:49,420
He's cutting the meat and he's hanging 
up,

3192
02:20:49,690 --> 02:20:52,180
you know,
a computer all day long.

3193
02:20:52,181 --> 02:20:57,181
How he's,
he says he's got a laptop but it's not 

3194
02:20:57,181 --> 02:20:57,181
online.
You know,

3195
02:20:57,181 --> 02:20:57,181
it's fucking incredible,
man.

3196
02:20:57,181 --> 02:20:59,050
That's really what a wild way to live 
your life.

3197
02:20:59,180 --> 02:20:59,810
Yeah.
No.

3198
02:20:59,830 --> 02:21:00,670
Alright,
ladies and gentlemen,

3199
02:21:00,700 --> 02:21:01,270
that's it,
right?

3200
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:04,780
This is a long ass one.
Two and a half hours pitches.

3201
02:21:04,781 --> 02:21:05,390
That's how we grow.
We,

3202
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:07,540
we're going to be at the Tempe Improv 
this Thursday,

3203
02:21:07,541 --> 02:21:08,090
Friday,
Friday,

3204
02:21:08,190 --> 02:21:09,670
Saturday.
Jump on it.

3205
02:21:09,700 --> 02:21:12,490
Saturday night is basically sold out 
because it was only like 20 tickets left

3206
02:21:12,491 --> 02:21:17,491
this morning of the second.
The second show is 20 tickets left the 

3207
02:21:17,491 --> 02:21:18,140
first show sold out.
And so it's gonna.

3208
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:20,350
It's going to go quick.
Thank you very much everybody.
