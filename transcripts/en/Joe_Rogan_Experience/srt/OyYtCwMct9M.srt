00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,560
Hello Freak bitches to hear about all
those people dying from heroin overdoses

2
00:00:05,561 --> 00:00:08,980
because there was a bad batch of
heroin in like Ohio or something.

3
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:12,790
And like 41 people I've overdosed
on like the same heroin or,

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,020
I did hear about that.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,003
I did hear about it.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,050
No.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,950
Did you hear about that?

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,300
What,

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,180
how do you say that stuff?

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,210
Kratos him.

11
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:19,890
How'd he say it?

12
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,090
Keratome k.

13
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:22,230
R.

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,230
A.

15
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,230
T.

16
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,230
O.

17
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,350
M.

18
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,183
How'd he say it?

19
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,860
Let's say you're probably
close to a trout.

20
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:27,780
Them Kratom Kratom may be Kratom.

21
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,250
I don't know how to say it.

22
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:29,941
I've never said it,

23
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:31,080
but I've read about it a lot.

24
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,070
And uh,

25
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:32,371
it's,

26
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:32,940
uh,

27
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,020
a plant that helps people overcome
opiate addiction apparently.

28
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,420
And the FDA just moved it to schedule
one or they're going to move it to

29
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:43,770
schedule one or the DEA,

30
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:44,221
I should say.

31
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,300
I guess it's the Dea.

32
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:46,134
Right?

33
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,650
But it's,

34
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,483
it's a plant

35
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,560
and apparently it helps a lot of people
that have a heroin addiction problems

36
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:53,730
and opiate addiction problems.

37
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:57,790
And even some people said
it helps with marijuana,

38
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,591
not marijuana,

39
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,880
but a alcohol withdrawals,

40
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,421
like people,

41
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,021
alcoholics.

42
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:03,750
And they try to break free and get sober.

43
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,250
This stuff can help with that too.

44
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,870
I don't know enough about it.

45
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:07,890
You know,

46
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,370
I'm to have,

47
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,840
I'm going to have someone
on to talk about it,

48
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:10,674
but it's just,

49
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,440
there's no need to make
anything else illegal like this,

50
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:17,790
this thing where they're doing like what
they're doing is they're behaving like

51
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,080
an archaic society.

52
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,110
They're not behaving like America 2016
they're behaving like the people who

53
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:29,271
enacted the very first
sweeping psychedelic laws of
1970 they're behaving like

54
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,410
they behaved.

55
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,060
If you've got this plant,

56
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,410
this Kratom or how have you say it and
it doesn't have any history of people

57
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,180
like dropping dead from it.

58
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,880
It's not like some threat
to the communities.

59
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,800
It's not like this a terror
that's sweeping the streets
and it's ruining lives.

60
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,760
You're not hearing that.

61
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,940
All I'm hearing is it helps
people with heroin addiction.

62
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,220
We all know how many people
are addicted to heroin.

63
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,170
So the fact that they just want to step
in and immediately not just make this

64
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:02,070
like a schedule two or schedule three
or have some scientists come in and

65
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:06,150
testify about it and have some sort of
public hearings where they discuss the

66
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,940
merits of keeping this drug legal
and should this be regulated?

67
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,060
Should it be prescribed by doctors
like reasonable adults would do if they

68
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:14,160
actually gave a fuck about each other,

69
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,340
but instead they have these
fucking ridiculous amounts
of power where they could

70
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:25,080
just step in and just make things illegal.

71
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,950
They have a ridiculous amount of power
when it comes to legislating what we can

72
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:32,430
and can't do with our bodies because
this is not something anybody's voting on

73
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:33,540
this kratom stuff.

74
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,320
So for the DEA to just step
in and make that schedule one,

75
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,480
it's blasphemy.

76
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,180
Like what they're doing is a mat.

77
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:41,490
It's a,

78
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,400
it's such an abuse of the
function of the office.

79
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,490
The idea of the office is you're
supposed to be protecting people,

80
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,210
protect people from math prep,

81
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,700
protect people from bad shit.

82
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,271
Don't.

83
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,700
Don't let people come home
to find their children,

84
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,270
uh,

85
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,421
that,

86
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:57,270
that have overdosed because
someone gave them bath salts,

87
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,720
right?

88
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:57,901
That's,

89
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:00,730
that's what everybody wants
from something like the Dea.

90
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,890
But they're so far reaching with their
efforts that they step into all these

91
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:08,260
areas where we know you're full of shit.

92
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:11,260
Now he's stepped in these
areas like marijuana,

93
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,240
or you're going to save people from pot.

94
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,830
Congratulations.

95
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,660
You've fucking cock blocker.

96
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,581
What are you going to do?

97
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:22,270
You're gonna say people from giggling or
eating yummy food or having a good time

98
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:22,781
with their friends.

99
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:23,200
What are you going?

100
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,411
What are you,

101
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,244
what are you stopping?

102
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:24,881
These are,

103
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:27,280
this is not anything that we should ever,

104
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,180
not,

105
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,660
not anything we should ever ask
for from our leaders in quotes,

106
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,380
and definitely not anything we should
ever tolerate for no reason whatsoever.

107
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,650
There's no reason whatsoever why
they would keep marijuana illegal.

108
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,190
There's no reason whatsoever whether it
would make this kratom stuff scheduled

109
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:42,461
ones.

110
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:43,600
There's no fucking reasons.

111
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,250
Money.

112
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:44,530
It's,

113
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:44,981
it is.

114
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:47,650
It's a sure sign that
it's a corrupt system.

115
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,070
If that Kratom stuff helps
with alcohol withdrawals,

116
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:56,071
then you got to know that
these big companies would,

117
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,020
why wouldn't they pitch
them some money to be like,

118
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,680
Hey,

119
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,110
let's you don't want Mencken.

120
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,910
Even if they didn't do it blatantly,

121
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,070
even if they didn't do it blatantly,

122
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,050
if they're in tangled with each other,

123
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,890
you can best believe that if you are
entangled with some sort of an alcohol

124
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:12,724
company,

125
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,330
you're going to do your best to maximize
the profits of that alcohol company.

126
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:16,960
Right?

127
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,950
I mean it's just the way it is.

128
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:22,480
If you're entangled with some donor
to some political campaign or some,

129
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,330
some,

130
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,160
you know like foundation that you run
and they give millions of dollars,

131
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:29,860
like you guys having a little
agreement going on there.

132
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,060
You don't have to even say it.

133
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,560
You don't have to have a written down.

134
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,090
You don't have to be stupid about it,

135
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,710
but it's pretty obvious.

136
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,170
If someone gives you
millions of bucks there,

137
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:39,580
you know you guys are out,

138
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,840
you guys are doing business,

139
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,920
something's happening here.

140
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,980
You know you're going to do
nice things for each other now.

141
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,360
And that's,

142
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,490
that's where a lot of
this shit comes from.

143
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,890
Like the,

144
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,130
the fact that we,

145
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,030
the people,

146
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,270
the people that are supposed
to be represented by these
clowns can sit back and

147
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,130
just be frustrated and not do anything.

148
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,230
We could vote for it when
it comes up in our states.

149
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:05,020
But federally it's a
giant issue federally.

150
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,310
Federally is the real problem because
there's a bunch of states now that made it

151
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:09,641
illegal,

152
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,560
including Washington fucking DC.

153
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,160
It's a bunch of states that
have made pot legal there.

154
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,561
They're like,

155
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:14,741
look,

156
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:15,510
it's ridiculous.

157
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,960
Doesn't the scientists and fit?

158
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,320
And then they start taxing it and then
they make unbelievable amounts of money

159
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:23,410
and then they have massive resurgences
and their economy like you're seeing in

160
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:26,770
Colorado and now you're seeing in
Seattle and Washington state as well.

161
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,500
What they're doing is they're,

162
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,050
they're being Tyron nickel like these,

163
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:32,410
these are,

164
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,900
this is not like reasonable people acting
in a reasonable way out that they're

165
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,030
locking people up for a long time.

166
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,200
Oh my God.

167
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:44,230
There was this fucking thing the other
day where they were comparing that kid

168
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,210
who raped the girl and
what university was that.

169
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:49,540
It has got ridiculously
short amount of time.

170
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,071
What's that?

171
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,990
You don't have a mic on Stanford.

172
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,033
Stanford?

173
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,963
Is that what it is?

174
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,780
That guy,

175
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,620
so they compared that guy too.

176
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,050
I'm sit some poor bastard that,

177
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,790
oh my God,

178
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,480
I think he got 30 years for growing pot.

179
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,230
Oh yeah.

180
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,190
Did you see that picture?

181
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,863
Did you see it?

182
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,981
Dude?

183
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:11,540
He was even longer than 30 years,

184
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,231
man.

185
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:12,801
It might've been.

186
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,330
It might've been like
30 to life or something,

187
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:18,470
but it's just the idea that you would
lock that guy away for that long for

188
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:20,540
something so fucking innocuous.

189
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,990
We'll put it below little blank.

190
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,331
The law.

191
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,320
It's real simple.

192
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,540
We got a law or you
don't want to break it.

193
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,590
Okay.

194
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,000
You take your consequences.

195
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,620
We're adults here.

196
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,311
We're all adults.

197
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,270
These laws are stupid.

198
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:35,420
We're being handicapped
by these ancient systems,

199
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,310
these ancient systems of control.

200
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,671
They don't,

201
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:38,750
they're not valid anymore.

202
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,940
He can't just lock people up for pot.

203
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,870
It's stupid.

204
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,243
Here it is.

205
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:44,571
Lee.

206
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:49,400
Carol Brooker a 75 year old veteran
serving a life sentence in prison without

207
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:53,270
parole for being caught growing three
dozen marijuana plants behind my son's

208
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:53,600
house.

209
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,200
Wow.

210
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,190
Oh my God.

211
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:55,971
And it says,

212
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:56,151
hi,

213
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:57,020
I'm Brock Turner,

214
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,030
20 year old who raped a woman on campus.

215
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,650
I just got six months in prison.

216
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,260
I'm also promised that with good behavior,

217
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:04,910
that would be cut down to three months.

218
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,350
Jesus Christ.

219
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,100
Wow.

220
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,401
Yeah.

221
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:08,150
He's already out.

222
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,540
Yeah.

223
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,180
And there's like a armed
protestors outside of his house.

224
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,253
Oh my God.

225
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,321
Oh my God.

226
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:14,900
I'm so rape before joints,

227
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:15,410
guys.

228
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,243
Yeah.

229
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,750
That's just crazy.

230
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,920
If you're going to rape a girl,

231
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,900
don't do it on a pile of marijuana plants.

232
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,483
That's what we learned.

233
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,120
That'd be a good plus three months.

234
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,470
Okay.
