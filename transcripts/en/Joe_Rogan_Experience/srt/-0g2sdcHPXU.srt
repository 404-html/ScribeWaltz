1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:03,720
Oh,

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,100
but after Lisa was on the other
day and listening to Lee on that,

4
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:10,140
like he's leads never been
to a strip club before,

5
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:12,120
but his little voice when
he chimes and he's like,

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:12,780
ah,

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,700
I've never been to a
strip club of authority.

8
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,390
It's still never been to his true calling.

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:16,530
No,

10
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,460
he's scared of him.

11
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,260
He said,

12
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,760
I want to take that
guy to a sister so bad.

13
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,810
Why is he scared?

14
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,621
Uh,

15
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:23,010
I don't know.

16
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,410
He,

17
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,243
I don't know.

18
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:24,690
It's,

19
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,260
I think it's a money
thing cause he says like,

20
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:26,450
Hey,

21
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,151
you just don't get it.

22
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:28,020
You pay the money.

23
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:29,510
Then they tried to get money on a e.

24
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,453
Oh

25
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,910
there's someone told a story recently
about Jeremiah Watkins trying to,

26
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,630
they took him to a strip
club and he freaked out and
just like ran out the back.

27
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,671
The same kind of thing.

28
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:39,100
Like he'd,

29
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,940
I don't know if he's ever been to
one or doesn't want to go or yeah,

30
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:42,211
he,

31
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:42,430
yeah,

32
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,880
he looked at the ground
and walk from the front.

33
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,030
You've never looking up all the
way to the pack after pack tour.

34
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,020
Yeah,

35
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,440
I did.

36
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,330
I did get a day.

37
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,091
It's just crazy.

38
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:56,091
I did a show with George Perez and
Compton at a strip club in Compton.

39
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,930
And let me tell you,

40
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:58,261
man,

41
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:59,160
that was one of them.

42
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:01,890
The most eye opening like that exist.

43
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:02,851
We walk in,

44
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:03,540
there's strippers.

45
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,280
The stripper just came up to me and goes,

46
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,173
hey honey,

47
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,740
look at this pussy ass.

48
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,141
Wow.

49
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:08,791
All the babies.

50
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,480
You want to get it.

51
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,560
You want some of this written?

52
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:10,780
I'm like,

53
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,750
right when I walked,

54
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,023
Whoa,

55
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,273
whoa.

56
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,353
What'd she look like?

57
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,390
Uh,

58
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:17,730
like,

59
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,960
cause my baby Mama like,

60
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:19,370
I dunno,

61
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,380
like there's,

62
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,430
it's still baby hand
sticking out of her probably

63
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,190
at blue baby horn.

64
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,220
She attractive.

65
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,761
No,

66
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:27,270
there was,

67
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,081
there was a few,

68
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:29,790
but then every time you
talked to him you're like,

69
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:29,971
Oh,

70
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,840
if I fuck up,

71
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:31,350
I'm dead.

72
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,591
You know,

73
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,470
like she was like ghetto.

74
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah.

75
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,590
It was pretty crazy.

76
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:35,220
For hostile.

77
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,430
Yeah.

78
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,630
What about the clientele?

79
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,500
Uh,

80
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,333
well they,

81
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,000
they,

82
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,490
they were mostly there for us.

83
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:41,081
Like they,

84
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:42,150
George just pretty much,

85
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,970
we had the whole club at ourselves.

86
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,840
I've always all people
coming to see the show.

87
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:47,430
So it was strippers too though.

88
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,940
And strippers to was the idea that you
would get people in there for the show

89
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:52,770
and then the girls would
dance for them afterwards.

90
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,190
Yeah.

91
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,110
And while we're doing the show,

92
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,310
they were coming and sitting on table,

93
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:57,300
hey you went to go get some,

94
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,680
but sex upstairs,

95
00:01:58,681 --> 00:01:59,514
you know,

96
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,163
sex.

97
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,850
So I got a question for you.

98
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,000
Can you talk about the run rabbit run
race you had that you won or yeah,

99
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,210
we can talk about that.

100
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,260
How that end.

101
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:10,560
No,

102
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,440
I'll let her describe it because it
sounds pretty crazy what happened.

103
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,850
Um,

104
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,850
so the hundred mile race that I was
doing a month before Moab add about,

105
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,310
I mean 12 miles roughly
to the finish line.

106
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,310
My vision started blurring
like in the periphery.

107
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,090
Um,

108
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,090
and over the course of the next couple
of miles closed in until it was pure

109
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:34,120
white.

110
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,410
I couldn't see anything.

111
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,071
Um,

112
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:41,071
so I just like stumbled my way along
roughly 10 miles of trails to get to the

113
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,204
finish line.

114
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,411
Pretty much.

115
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:46,660
I would say like 98% blind.

116
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,140
What I could see my feet like
right in front of my feet,

117
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,880
but it was just white out.

118
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,290
So I was running and um,

119
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,260
falling everywhere.

120
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,810
It was probably a
hilarious if people were,

121
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,210
but um,

122
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,560
I hit my head also on a rock.

123
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,700
One of them to your blind.

124
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,330
Yeah.

125
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,540
One of the times I fell so I
had blood dripping down my face,

126
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,460
like stumbling along.

127
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,400
Totally couldn't see the
trail and he still one.

128
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,001
Yeah.

129
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,170
Managed to finish and,

130
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,310
and hold the lead.

131
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,173
You're a savage.

132
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,520
Should give seminars
on how to be a savage.

133
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,810
That is crazy.

134
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,033
So what,

135
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,431
what did,

136
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:22,570
what happened to your vision?

137
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,471
Um,

138
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:27,160
so since then there's been tons of
people kind of talking about it.

139
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:28,510
Apparently it happens in,

140
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,160
in ultra is quite often they are
thinking it's a corneal edema.

141
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,270
So basically like I wear
contact lenses to see,

142
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:37,721
um,

143
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:42,721
and the like contact mixed with the air
and the dryness and all sorts of things

144
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:49,150
cause like a kind of fluid or
I'm not really sure how it works.

145
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:50,980
If you ever thought about
getting lasix or something,

146
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,490
people who have done lasik
also get this corneal edema.

147
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,290
So for now I'm just,

148
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,280
uh,

149
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,113
stay in,

150
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,920
stay in with the contacts because I've,

151
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,650
I've been learning how to deal
with those a little bit better.

152
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,821
What do they look?

153
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:04,700
Do they look different?

154
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,170
I look a fair bit different.

155
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:09,140
So that first bullet Jamie
showed was like a Brahmin bull.

156
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,320
Then one of those Grable's,

157
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,230
which is just bits of frigging every sort
of bull over a lot of generations will

158
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:18,230
come in and Nyland buried with it
and then sort of wrecks the herd.

159
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,070
And when,

160
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,900
when did they get released
or when did they escape?

161
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,291
Well,

162
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,720
it would have been with the first
Cadillac come into Australia.

163
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,700
So 18 hundreds and hundreds.

164
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:26,030
Yeah.

165
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,790
Wow.

166
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,110
Yeah.

167
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,040
So they've just sort of morphed and
become wild animals and the wild bulls.

168
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,903
Very dangerous.

169
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,631
Very dangerous.

170
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:32,960
Yeah.

171
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,700
So what happened was,

172
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:35,001
Pedro,

173
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:36,770
I shot these bowling and it dropped like,

174
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,440
you know,

175
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,330
down conscious.

176
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:38,721
He fought,

177
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:39,171
it was dead,

178
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,130
walked up to it.

179
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,360
It jumped up.

180
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:43,640
Like he literally got up
to it and it jumped up.

181
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:44,930
And anyway,

182
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,680
it ended up getting him against the tray.

183
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,290
Like he ran to get up a tree,

184
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,840
he felt it hit him and it sort
of lifted him up the tree.

185
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,440
He climbed up the tree is the gross bit.

186
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,680
Then he felt something warm and his
legs and looked down and his guts and

187
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:58,491
everything hanging down.

188
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:00,680
And I read his legs but he's a tough boss.

189
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:01,310
Did he?

190
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,980
Gavin his stomach back up
and sort of hold it in place.

191
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,720
Then the ball actually died.

192
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,790
He climbed down out of the train,

193
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,800
ended up dawn two times I think once in
the air because the royal flying doctors

194
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:13,430
come in,

195
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,530
grabbed him cause he's a long
way out in the middle of nowhere.

196
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,060
And uh,

197
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,610
then once on the table is
operating table as well.

198
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,713
Wow.

199
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,120
He survived all that and end
up dying of a bloody mess,

200
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:23,691
heart attack.

201
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:24,610
So no way.

202
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah.

203
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,070
When uh,

204
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,390
it was only thing,

205
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,390
it was only 36 or 37.

206
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,240
Do you think it had anything to do
with the accident that I reckon it was

207
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:33,074
related at all.

208
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,590
Really?

209
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,423
Yeah.

210
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,600
You would think that a guy could
get past getting gored by air,

211
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,380
pushes guts back into them.

212
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:39,921
Like,

213
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,420
that guy's not going
to get a heart attack.

214
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:41,720
Uh,

215
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,890
that's life's not fair.

216
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,490
Right.

217
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,030
Wow.

218
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,750
That's crazy.

219
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:44,961
Right?

220
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:45,321
But I mean,

221
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:47,170
has anybody been skeptical as anybody?

222
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:47,390
Yeah.

223
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,260
Everyone's skeptical.

224
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:48,500
Yeah.

225
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,390
And w w what's your response to that?

226
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,613
You don't know what I know,

227
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,461
right?

228
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:52,601
Well,

229
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:53,630
what do you know though?

230
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,533
I don't know.

231
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,190
I can't tell you some of the shit
that I know and I can't tell you,

232
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,881
but what could it be?

233
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,020
That's so crazy if you,

234
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:00,740
you know,

235
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,760
I mean what you've said,

236
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,140
we'll think about what you've said.

237
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,170
You said that there's some ridiculous
sorta propulsion system that allows you to

238
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,380
move through time,

239
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,670
that they,

240
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,480
they visit this planet all the
time and extract resources,

241
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:14,990
right?

242
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,010
That there's people in the government
that are trying to disseminate this

243
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:19,641
information,

244
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:20,630
but they don't know how to do it.

245
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,980
They don't have the right vehicle do it.

246
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,920
They're doing it in these
sort of controlled chunks.

247
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,960
Think of all these
things that you've said.

248
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,550
What could possibly be crazier than that?

249
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,830
Well you're asking me
how do I know and no,

250
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:32,031
no,

251
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:32,151
no,

252
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:32,271
no.

253
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:35,630
I'm asking you what do you know that
could possibly be crazier than that?

254
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,560
Well,

255
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,131
that's the shit.

256
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:37,964
I can't tell you.

257
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,130
It's not everything's Hunky Dory.

258
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,860
Is it something where you worried
about the fate of the human race?

259
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,300
I think that's part of it.

260
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,253
Where should I move?

261
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,233
If I was going to move?

262
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,280
It's not existential.

263
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,800
If your dick out of I
should go to Australia.

264
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,823
How about,

265
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,740
how about I guess pick out in Australia?

266
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,080
I mean where's the spot?

267
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,880
I don't think there is one spot.

268
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,460
They just,

269
00:06:59,460 --> 00:06:59,940
this is,

270
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,830
this is what I will say.

271
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,120
It's not existential in the sense of a,

272
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,470
they're,

273
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,660
I'm not going to come here like
independence day in nuke the place.

274
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,620
Um,

275
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,370
but it,

276
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,030
there,

277
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,301
you know,

278
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:11,360
there are things to worry about but
sometimes you read these books with the

279
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:13,640
writers go a little too
far with that bullshit,

280
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,043
you know what I'm saying?

281
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,360
Whatever.

282
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,270
It's just too much.

283
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,490
It's like you were saying,

284
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,710
you ever go to people's houses and they
talk and then he'd say shift for 20

285
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:22,544
minutes.

286
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,330
They let a lot of,

287
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,530
it's like by studios to the,

288
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,364
where I live,

289
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,200
go to that coffee shop from time to time,

290
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:28,640
you know what they was
saying in the world,

291
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,011
but they,

292
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:30,050
after the Vegas shooter,

293
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,670
the Vegas shooter was Sunday night.

294
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,160
Do you know what these idiots
were saying in there Monday?

295
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,260
But that this had to do with women's
rights and abortions and they just talk

296
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,100
these new,

297
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,630
this new breed of gentiles.

298
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,040
They just talk.

299
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,850
That's all they do is talk
with big words to impress you.

300
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,110
But then don't say shit.

301
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,910
Don't say shit.

302
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,900
Three or four big words to
let you know they're smart.

303
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:55,310
And then they didn't say nothing.

304
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,530
And there's a lot of repeating narratives.

305
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:57,950
Oh yeah.

306
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,600
Every time the show,

307
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,800
the new show I'm gonna do,

308
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,720
I'm buying one of those
little tape recorders,

309
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,130
putting up Mondays,

310
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,750
six fucking morons every day.

311
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,620
Then at night I'm going to do a show
about what they discussed because this is

312
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,370
60% of America with these fucking people
are talking about this is the idiots.

313
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,480
The shit that comes out
of that mouth is amazing.

314
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,070
And you sit there and go,

315
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,280
no one to fucking isis wants to shoot us.

316
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,690
Listen to these fucking dummies.

317
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,670
Listen to what's coming
out of their mouth.

318
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,080
Women's rights.

319
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,280
That's what they talking about that.

320
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,353
Well,

321
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,760
what was their argument there?

322
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,880
They were saying that the guy,

323
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,340
they all get that argument.

324
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:37,460
Is everybody trying to be
smarter than everybody?

325
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,400
It's just six people
trying out with each other.

326
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,670
It's like when you go to those fucking
dinner party parties you talk about,

327
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,680
and by the time they served the salad,

328
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,260
you want to put a gun
in your fucking mouth.

329
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,890
Why am I even fucking
here with these people?

330
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:51,320
I could have stopped at Burger
King and had a better fucking time.

331
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,980
That's why I don't go to those dinner
parties because there's eight people and

332
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,340
politics comes up.

333
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,840
You loosely Joe Rogan.

334
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,940
I don't want to hear about it no more.

335
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,500
You lose me.

336
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,940
You lose me.

337
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:05,100
These new political
people talking nonsense.

338
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,960
You lucidly move forward.

339
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,220
Either impeach him,

340
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:10,050
get a new one or shut the fuck up.

341
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:10,861
I can't,

342
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:12,120
you'll put the news on anymore,

343
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,450
but it's definitely 20 minutes on.

344
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:14,700
Yeah.

345
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,810
He didn't send the check.

346
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,853
He called her,

347
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,450
what the fuck man?

348
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,590
Just tell who gives a fuck.

349
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,813
Who gives a fuck?

350
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,230
There's gotta be something more.

351
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,690
There's got to be a seal
stuck on a beat somewhere.

352
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,590
This fucking country,

353
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,980
something more important than
this shit every fucking day.

354
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,770
So the politics is over my world.

355
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,843
Religion,

356
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:33,840
you know,

357
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,391
I don't want it there.

358
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:37,380
You're not supposed to talk about politics
or religion at those fucking things,

359
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,200
but this new breed of gentile,

360
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:45,590
they just talk for the sense of talking
to see who's the smartest person in the

361
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:46,021
room.

362
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:47,010
And at the end of the day,

363
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,650
they're all a bunch of dump fucks anyway.

364
00:09:59,550 --> 00:09:59,610
Okay.
