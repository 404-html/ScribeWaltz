1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,040
No,
three,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,260
two,
one.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,560
I always wonder what you base your 
countdown on,

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:09,970
Jamie.
You got two things going.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:15,030
Why is it an accurate count on or use 
roughly guessing like a five count 

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,491
because we have a.
does it delay the thing and then the 

7
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:19,491
thing and that thing and.
Okay,

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,940
well we're live.
Chris,

9
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:23,130
what's up to to be here.
Thanks for doing this man.

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,190
My pleasure.
We were just talking about the term 

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,611
Paleo,
like I put up a that we're gonna talk 

12
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:35,631
about nutrition and diet and all that 
good stuff and then somebody went to 

13
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:36,370
your page and it says,
you know,

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,620
Paleo and lifestyle expert.
As soon as you have that word Paleo,

15
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:41,790
people go,
oh,

16
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,300
fuck.

17
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,440
Serious baggage.
That's true.

18
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,990
I mean,
every day I think about,

19
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,050
Oh,
I kinda wish I never would have used 

20
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:53,050
this word.

21
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,680
Yeah.
Well let's Mark Sisson went with primal.

22
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,040
Yeah.
He's.

23
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,620
He uses that primal blueprint.
Yeah.

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,100
You know,
that's his sort of distinction of it.

25
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,730
I like that.
I mean they're both just words is what 

26
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,550
it really comes down to A.
I thought about,

27
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:09,710
I wrote a book that has the word Paleo 
in it,

28
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,140
and I thought about even before I 
published a book,

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,240
I was thinking,
you know,

30
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:18,680
what I'm talking about is not really 
what people mean when they say Paleo.

31
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,860
It's a lot more inclusive and a lot less
dogmatic and if I use this word,

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,430
there's going to be pros and cons.
The pro is people recognize it.

33
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,470
It's,
it's one word that that points at a 

34
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,101
whole way of thinking.
I could have called it the new nutrient 

35
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:38,090
dense ancestral,
you know,

36
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:43,091
nutrition book,
but that's not too catchy and like five 

37
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:44,430
people that read it.
Um,

38
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,700
and,
but on the other hand,

39
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,620
Paleo has a ton of baggage,
as you said.

40
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:48,960
You know,
it,

41
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:49,490
it,
it.

42
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,040
People get a certain idea when they hear
that word.

43
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,220
And for some it's good.
For others it's kind of neutral.

44
00:01:55,221 --> 00:02:00,221
They don't know anything about it.
And then for still others it's like 

45
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:03,191
instant turn off and you know,
why should we be emulating our Paleo 

46
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:05,450
ancestors lifestyles.
They all died when they were 30.

47
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:07,100
This is stupid,
you know,

48
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,160
why should we do this?
So it's a totally loaded term,

49
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,530
I think we just need to get past it as,
as a,

50
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,640
you know,
an idea or a term and look at what it's 

51
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:18,830
really pointing at it and evaluated on 
that basis.

52
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,140
Yeah,
I think that makes a lot sense.

53
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:23,770
And also there was the issue with the 
term Paleolithic,

54
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,780
like using the term Paleo and then there
were some articles written about the 

55
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,171
actual diet of the Paleolithic people 
where they ate everything they got a 

56
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:34,510
hold of and if they got grains they eat 
a ton of grains.

57
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:34,790
Yeah,

58
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,120
absolutely.
So,

59
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,540
I mean we know they weren't eating 
cheese doodles and drinking big Gulps,

60
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:44,541
right?
So it's kind of easier to talk about 

61
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:44,541
Paleo in terms of what it didn't 
include.

62
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,100
So it didn't include processed and 
refined,

63
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,610
you know,
Brad flower cookies,

64
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:52,410
muffins,
uh,

65
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:57,411
all kinds of packaged foods that 
comprise a large percentage of the 

66
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,040
American diet.
I think that top six foods now,

67
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,160
our grain based desserts,
sugar sweetened beverages,

68
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,420
pizza.
I'm chicken dishes,

69
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,750
which are primarily fried chicken 
nuggets.

70
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,660
I'm forgetting the other two,
but it's all crap.

71
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,690
You know,
the foods wasn't the prime or six 

72
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,480
primary foods.
America Americans is just completely 

73
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
nutrient depleted junk,
you know,

74
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:27,481
so we can all agree that our Paleolithic
ancestors weren't eating those foods and

75
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:31,480
then we know it's pretty clear that they
were eating a lot of neat.

76
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,460
Well,
I'm sure we'll talk about that.

77
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,010
Meat and fish,
wild fruits and vegetables,

78
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:38,260
not the domesticated varieties that 
we're eating today,

79
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:42,460
but wild fruits and vegetables,
nuts and seeds and some starchy plants.

80
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,110
So,
so,

81
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,370
so those are the two extremes.
If we bracketed and then things like 

82
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,900
grains and the GMS were more of a 
question mark,

83
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,930
like there's some recent evidence that 
shows that that lagoon consumption was 

84
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,410
probably pretty more common than we 
thought amongst our Paleo ancestors.

85
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:01,960
They were,
they came later onto the scene,

86
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:05,080
but if they were there,
they probably ate them.

87
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,380
Is that based on geography?
Like we're lagoons are present.

88
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,410
Exactly.
And what other food sources were 

89
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,511
available.
It's pretty clear that they weren't the 

90
00:04:15,511 --> 00:04:15,511
first option.
You know,

91
00:04:15,511 --> 00:04:15,511
if they were able to slaughter an 
animal,

92
00:04:15,511 --> 00:04:19,180
they would have done that and,
and eating the organs and the brain.

93
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:21,760
And probably throw in the muscle meat to
the dogs.

94
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,750
Really?
Yeah.

95
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,280
Yeah.
We have it backwards.

96
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:29,281
I mean,
when you look at traditional hunter 

97
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:29,740
gatherers and the way they eat animals,
they go just like wild animals do.

98
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,040
When wild animal kills another animal,
it goes straight for the organs.

99
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,550
And that's because the organs are way 
more nutrient dense than the muscle 

100
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,550
needs.
Um,

101
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,350
and so traditional peoples,
they knew the same thing even without 

102
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,190
having access to science and you know,
knowing even what a nutrient was,

103
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,580
they just over generations figured out 
that eating liver and the kidneys and 

104
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:54,640
the spleen and the brain was,
was going to give them more energy,

105
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,650
make them feel better,
make them more fertile than eating the 

106
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,071
muscle meats.
But did they eat the muscle meats at 

107
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:02,071
all?
I mean,

108
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:02,680
it seems to me that they probably did 
because they hungry.

109
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,900
They use every part of the animal,
but it was clear that the organs were 

110
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:07,900
where the,
the,

111
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,540
the,
the favorite thing to eat.

112
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,570
And how do we know this?
I'm just start anthropological studies 

113
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,470
of hunter gathers a contemporary hunter 
gatherers,

114
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:18,400
you know,
in the sixties,

115
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,210
seventies,
eighties,

116
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:24,211
there aren't many extent hunter gatherer
groups that we can even study now 

117
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:24,530
because they've,
you know,

118
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,930
they've all been basically assimilated.

119
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,330
Um,
but you know,

120
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:36,331
like the Hudson Hunter gatherers in 
Africa and there are some groups that 

121
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:40,171
are still living a lifestyle that's 
relatively close to what they were 

122
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:40,510
living for the last 10,000
years.

123
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:42,970
And we can learn a lot by studying those
groups.

124
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,110
And that's a pretty common theme in all 
of these traditional peoples as they.

125
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,190
They focused on eating the organ meats,
you know,

126
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,290
second would be probably meet another 
animal products in terms of nutrient 

127
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,000
density.
They ate a much broader variety of plant

128
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,820
species and we eat like,
you know,

129
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,810
across the world.
Most people eat,

130
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:07,811
you know,
four to eight plant species in their 

131
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:08,030
diet.
A traditional hunter gatherer groups.

132
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:09,810
It was over 100.
Wow.

133
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,190
They were just whatever was edible,
huge diversity of plants.

134
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:15,620
And that of course increase the nutrient
density,

135
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,240
increase the fiber that they were 
eating,

136
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:19,970
which we now know feeds of beneficial 
gut bacteria.

137
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,660
Which has all kinds of uh,
benefits for health and,

138
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,230
and again,
they weren't eating the foods that we 

139
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,570
are now,
you know,

140
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,780
uh,
eating way more than we're eating 

141
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:34,780
anything else.
And when I say we,

142
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,611
I mean just Americans or people living 
in the industrialized world in general 

143
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:42,860
and that's,
that's a problem because of this concept

144
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,760
of a species appropriate diet and we 
know that all organisms evolve,

145
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,870
evolve in a certain environment and 
they're are adapted to survive in that 

146
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,081
environment and when their diet or 
lifestyle it gets too far from what they

147
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,690
evolved for,
this mismatch occurs.

148
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:03,680
And that mismatch is really responsible 
for all modern disease.

149
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Yeah.
That is something that I thought was 

150
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,161
really interesting,
but reading some of your work and some 

151
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:14,230
of your articles that you had sort of 
narrowed down to I believe eight.

152
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:17,720
The eight different factors that 
contribute to a,

153
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,250
to ill health that are a lot of times 
ignored when diseases are,

154
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,710
when,
when someone gets,

155
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,500
when someone gets diagnosed with an 
illness,

156
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:32,560
almost immediately there's a drug 
prescribed to treat the illness,

157
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,340
but there's not like sort of,
um,

158
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,640
backing up of the process to find out.
Okay,

159
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:42,820
how did you get to this position?
Like what is your diet like?

160
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,940
Are you getting enough sleep?
What kind of stress are you under?

161
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,180
Is your body.
I'm exposed to toxins on a regular basis

162
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,450
like you do you work with paint,
you know what I mean?

163
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,330
Are you,
are you near something that's really bad

164
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:55,930
for you to breathe?

165
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

166
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,230
I mean,
the analogy I like to use is you have a 

167
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,230
rock in your shoe and it's making your 
foot hurt.

168
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,490
You could take advil,
right?

169
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,010
And it's gonna.
You'll probably feel less pain,

170
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,100
but you could also just take your shoe 
off and dump out that rock.

171
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,770
That would be a better idea.
Right?

172
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:15,530
I think we can all agree on that.
And our Ma,

173
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,610
our medical system is the equivalent of 
taking advil when you have that rock in 

174
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,500
your shoe,
if you have high blood pressure,

175
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,110
you go to the doctor,
you'll get a medication to lower it.

176
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,010
If you have high cholesterol,
you'll be prescribed to staten and those

177
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,950
can be effective at bringing those 
numbers down.

178
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,340
But there's rarely any investigation 
into what's causing that symptom in the 

179
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,640
first place.
And you know,

180
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,810
the problem with that is take the high 
blood pressure medication,

181
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,380
it lowers your blood pressure,
but then you have no libido.

182
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,450
And so what's the solution there?
Another drug that increases your libido,

183
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:52,490
you get via Viagara,
but then Viagra,

184
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,350
you know,
causes of some other side effect.

185
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:58,530
And then you get prescribed another drug
to deal with that side effect.

186
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:03,531
And then by the time you're 65 or 70,
you're taking seven or eight 

187
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:06,681
medications.
And the statistics actually bear this 

188
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:06,681
out.
You know,

189
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:10,431
most people at that age are taking two 
handfuls of pills just to,

190
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,510
you know,
to,

191
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,520
uh,
to be able to get by.

192
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:18,930
And that's really not the way that human
beings evolved,

193
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,760
evolved and are designed for.

194
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,170
It's also it becomes a problem because 
there's a lot of money being made on 

195
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:26,750
selling those things.
Absolutely.

196
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,790
And the pharmaceutical industry is this 
gigantic monster of a business where 

197
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:38,871
they're just making billions and 
billions of dollars and there's so much 

198
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:39,960
momentum when you have a big industry

199
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,140
that absolutely.
And they realized a while back that the 

200
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,370
big money in drugs is not in treating 
sick people.

201
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:53,371
It's in treating healthy people because 
they are way more healthy people than 

202
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:56,881
there are sick people.
And so once you get done with making 

203
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:01,021
drugs to treat diseases,
you need to start making drugs to give 

204
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:04,320
to people who are fundamentally healthy 
but maybe have like some one lab marker 

205
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,460
that's out of range.
So take stat and drugs for example.

206
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,240
You know,
there's only a certain number of people 

207
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,450
that have already had heart attacks and 
are in danger,

208
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,700
you know,
high risk of having another heart 

209
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,411
attack.
So you first stat and drug sales to 

210
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,951
grow.
They need to expand beyond that 

211
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:24,811
population and start prescribing them to
people who aren't necessarily at high 

212
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:27,650
risk for heart disease,
but um,

213
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,190
you know,
maybe have slightly high cholesterol and

214
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:32,170
that's where the real money is made.

215
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,470
Wow.
So,

216
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,510
so people that don't have really health 
consequences of this,

217
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,230
like,
uh,

218
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,290
like if you have high cholesterol,
high cholesterol is a lot of times 

219
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:46,970
associated with diet.
Yeah.

220
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,060
But the reality of cholesterol and 
cholesterol rich diets and blood lipids 

221
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,130
is that it doesn't really move the 
needle.

222
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,600
It's so much more complex than that.
And what is the cause of like if a 

223
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,220
person has high cholesterol,
what are the potential causes?

224
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,160
So diet is definitely one genetics or 
not,

225
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:08,710
or just certain genetic polymorphisms 
that make you more susceptible to having

226
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:12,010
high cholesterol.
But there are a number of causes.

227
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,740
They're lesser known.
So poor thyroid function.

228
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:19,741
It's one cause because thyroid hormones 
required to clear ldl cholesterol from 

229
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:20,710
the circulation.
So if you have,

230
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,980
you know,
even suboptimal thyroid function,

231
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:24,720
not frank,
hi.

232
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,560
You know,
full on hypothyroidism,

233
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,170
but just a little bit of have a problem 
with thyroid.

234
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,840
Your cholesterol can be high,
and in fact,

235
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:36,280
back in the eighties or seventies before
statens were a,

236
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,370
became a bigger part of the,
of the treatment of high cholesterol 

237
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,370
doctors east to use low dose of thyroid 
hormone to treat high cholesterol.

238
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,070
So they knew this at one time,
um,

239
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,220
disrupted gut microbiome and leaky gut,
which I know you've talked about on this

240
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:58,611
show with other guests,
a ldl is actually an antimicrobial 

241
00:11:58,611 --> 00:11:58,870
substance.

242
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,350
So the liver will make more ldl 
particles if there's toxins,

243
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,960
endotoxins getting into the bloodstream 
from the gut.

244
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,460
Um,
infections can raise cholesterol,

245
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,640
ldl and toxins can do that too.
So there's studies showing mercury 

246
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,910
toxicity,
for example,

247
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:20,911
can raise cholesterol.
So these are all the potential 

248
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:24,151
underlying causes of high cholesterol.
So if someone comes to see me and they 

249
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:28,591
have that problem,
I'm going to test for all of those 

250
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:28,591
things.
I'm going to address those first.

251
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:32,290
And then we see what happens and if 
their liquids normalized after that,

252
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,130
great.
You know,

253
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:38,131
we've done our work and we end the avoid
taking a drug that they never needed to 

254
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:42,400
take in the first place.
If we retest and they're still in,

255
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,910
their levels are still high,
then we have a bigger conversation about

256
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,750
what the actual risk is given their 
level,

257
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,240
their age,
their sex,

258
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,270
their family history,
the absence or presence of other risk 

259
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,240
factors like high blood pressure and uh,
inflammation,

260
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,220
you know,
so it's,

261
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:03,520
it's,
it's really complex.

262
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,520
And then this idea that there's just an 
arbitrary number for total cholesterol 

263
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,051
and if you're higher than that,
you need to take a staton and if you're 

264
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:13,360
lower than that,
you don't is,

265
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,890
um,
I don't,

266
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,380
I can't think of a good comparison right
now,

267
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:22,150
but it's ridiculously over simplified 
and it also has some effect,

268
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,920
um,
or your,

269
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:28,921
your,
your eight year amount of exercise and 

270
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:28,921
your overall,
uh,

271
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:29,550
amount of,
uh,

272
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,980
uh,
what you put your body through as far as

273
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:34,870
like stress,
exercise,

274
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:38,140
activity that has some sort of an effect
on it as well.

275
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,960
Absolutely.
Cholesterol is a repair substance too.

276
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:45,961
So if there's any kind of damage,
endothelial damage in the arteries and 

277
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:49,360
the lining of the arteries,
cholesterol can be moved to that site to

278
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,180
repair the damage.
Um,

279
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,180
lifestyle choices definitely play a 
role.

280
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,100
So you know,
we need,

281
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,700
I think getting back to your,
to the original point here,

282
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:05,701
we need to be thinking more holistically
about what causes disease and how to 

283
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:10,351
treat it instead of just using bandaid 
approaches that suppress symptoms.

284
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,380
I mean we don't really have healthcare.
We have disease management not to toe.

285
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,170
That's a fundamental difference that we 
need to understand.

286
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:22,171
Like if you think of disease as a 
spectrum where you know the far end is 

287
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:27,181
death and here is perfect health.
Very rarely do people go from perfect 

288
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:28,990
health to,
you know,

289
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,020
straight to death.
I mean that happens in trauma accidents 

290
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,991
and things like that.
But usually we progressed along that 

291
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:40,021
spectrum and our conventional medical 
system is designed to intervene at the 

292
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:41,710
far end of that spectrum.
You know,

293
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:46,711
when we're,
we're already kind of past the point of 

294
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:46,711
no return.
You know,

295
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:47,080
we had these drugs that suppress 
symptoms.

296
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:50,320
We have pretty amazing trauma care.
Like if I get hit by a bus,

297
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:51,910
I don't want to go to the hospital,
you know,

298
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:57,290
we're,
we're starting to be able to restore 

299
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:57,290
sight to the blind and do these 
incredible things.

300
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,850
But they're all at that far end of the 
spectrum.

301
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:04,130
A conventional medicine is really lousy 
at preventing disease in the first place

302
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,220
or treating it at,
at this end of the spectrum when it's 

303
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,390
closer to health and it's really bad at 
promoting health.

304
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,880
In fact,
in most medical school textbooks,

305
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:18,881
there's not even a definition of health.
It's just basically the absence of 

306
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:20,600
disease.
But I think we can do better than that.

307
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,120
Yeah.
It just seems logical.

308
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,080
I mean,
it seems that,

309
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,840
that,
that should be an approach that everyone

310
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:32,841
should consider when you're looking at 
the broad spectrum of illnesses and 

311
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:36,771
diseases and injuries and all those 
different factors that are involved in 

312
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:39,750
making someone ill that this is what 
you're saying seems so common sense,

313
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,880
but it's not common at all.

314
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,860
Not Common at all.
Um,

315
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,760
it does seem common sense to me and I 
think part of the problem.

316
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,100
I mean,
you hinted at it before with big Pharma,

317
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,390
it's like there's little incentive for 
big Pharma,

318
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,720
big Pharma to promote this kind of 
approach.

319
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,620
Why,
why,

320
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,840
you know,
what's their interest in doing that?

321
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,780
I mean,
it means less sales for them.

322
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:05,781
They're there for profit corporations 
that are publicly owned and it's in 

323
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:09,921
their best interests of the shareholders
to do things that grow the company and 

324
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:11,410
grow the business.
Right?

325
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,950
That's just how it is.
That's how,

326
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,140
that's how our system is.
And you know,

327
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,730
that's,
that's a whole nother discussion.

328
00:16:17,731 --> 00:16:20,280
But um,
it,

329
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,360
it's problematic when it comes to 
healthcare because you know,

330
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,100
the way it really should work is if you 
go into your doctor and you have high 

331
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,170
cholesterol,
high blood pressure,

332
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:32,700
your doctor sits down,
says,

333
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,640
asked you a whole bunch of questions 
about what you're eating,

334
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,170
how you living,
are you sleeping,

335
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:39,510
are you exercising,
you taking care of yourself,

336
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:40,710
you managing your stress?

337
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,990
And then they do a whole bunch of 
testing.

338
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,760
They don't just test your blood 
pressure,

339
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:47,610
they don't just test your cholesterol,
they test your gut,

340
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,550
they test your,
your hpa axis,

341
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,680
which is what governs your whole stress 
response.

342
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:56,250
They list HPA,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.

343
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:58,200
So it's this,
the brain,

344
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,560
basically the connection between the 
brains and the brain and the adrenal 

345
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:03,840
glands,
and it governs our stress response.

346
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,430
So there are ways that we can test it to
see how you're being affected by stress.

347
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,850
So if you're under a lot of stress 
that's causing hormonal changes in your 

348
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:18,381
body,
it can affect every aspect of your how 

349
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:20,630
we can test for this.
So they would do a lot of testing 

350
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,200
upfront,
which would be more expensive initially,

351
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,740
but down the line it would save 
thousands or hundreds of thousands of 

352
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,730
dollars per patient.
So let's take someone with type full 

353
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,151
fledge type two diabetes,
depending on the estimate that I've 

354
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:36,750
seen,
it can cost anywhere from 60 to 80,000

355
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:39,970
to $400,000
to care for that patient over the,

356
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,330
their lifetime to the insurance company.

357
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,450
Because insurance is paying for a lot of
these procedures.

358
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:48,180
They develop,
let's say retinopathy later.

359
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,100
They go blind.
They,

360
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,760
you know,
they,

361
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:53,460
they require multiple operations and 
surgeries.

362
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:56,340
They're taking expensive drugs.
All of this stuff adds up.

363
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,540
But let's say we could have spent $1,500
right off the bat when before they even 

364
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,191
develop type two diabetes to identify 
what was happening and you know,

365
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,010
catch it before it happened and 
intervene.

366
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:14,100
Then yeah,
you spend a little bit more upfront,

367
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,130
but you ended up saving tens if not 
hundreds of thousands of dollars over 

368
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,611
the lifetime of the patient,
so I think eventually the insurance 

369
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:27,051
companies are going to realize this 
because there are also for profit 

370
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:30,171
businesses and they're interested 
ultimately in things that can save 

371
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:33,321
money.
They just don't yet see functional 

372
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,441
medicine,
which is what we're talking about right 

373
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:36,690
here as something that could potentially
save them a lot of money.

374
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,190
They see it as something that they have 
to spend money on because the testing is

375
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:46,191
more expensive upfront,
but they're not looking at the longterm 

376
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:46,191
game.

377
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:50,580
I wonder if pharmaceutical companies are
just going to buy up the insurance 

378
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:50,710
companies and use it like as a write 
off.

379
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,270
A cynical person may have that thought.
I mean I would,

380
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,440
if I was a pharmaceutical company,
I saw the writing on the wall like,

381
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,490
hey,
people are having way more access to 

382
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:05,490
information about health than ever 
before.

383
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,540
They're going to start to make these 
healthy choices and we're kind of fuck 

384
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:09,540
guys,
listen.

385
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:09,910
What we're going to do is we've got to 
get in there early.

386
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Stranger things have happened.
There's a lot of problems with this in 

387
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:20,560
terms of like doctors,
when you,

388
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:21,760
uh,
you're a doctor,

389
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:26,761
you have a line of patients waiting to 
get into your office and you have 

390
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:30,220
standard model of treatment that you've 
been sort of practicing for a long time.

391
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,610
So to deviate from this path and to say,
hey,

392
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,160
you know,
this whole rock in the shoe analogy that

393
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:37,270
you brought up,
which is brilliant,

394
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,330
it's a perfect way to describe it.
This all makes sense and it's logical 

395
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:42,330
and everything like that.
But,

396
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:42,790
uh,
you know,

397
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:47,791
hey,
insurance is not going to cover all 

398
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,801
these different tests.
We have a giant issue also in getting 

399
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:52,570
people to be proactive to actually do 
something.

400
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,290
How many people do we know?
I know a bunch that are fat,

401
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,890
that talk about being fat,
that have poor diets that drink too much

402
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:03,790
and eat too much sugar and constantly 
eating crap and not exercising.

403
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:09,210
They're 100 percent intellectually aware
of this and they don't do a goddamn 

404
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:09,210
thing about it.

405
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:09,610
Yeah,
you're right.

406
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:12,970
It's a systemic problem,
so if we break it down,

407
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,790
you know,
on the,

408
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,290
on the doctor care providers side and 
the inpatient side,

409
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,860
so the care provider's side,
I mean they're as much victims as,

410
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,480
as we are.
It's as,

411
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,870
as patients are to um,
to this whole system that's been set up 

412
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,970
because as you pointed out,
like the way the system works,

413
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:36,030
most doctors who were working in an Hmo 
type of setting have like seven to 10 

414
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,300
minutes to spend with a patient that's 
so crazy.

415
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:42,330
That's not enough time to have the kind 
of conversation that you need to have 

416
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,110
even even to get beyond saying hello and
writing a prescription,

417
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,220
a prescription,
which is basically what happens in of 

418
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,261
those encounters.
And then you also mentioned that the 

419
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:53,210
standard of care,
so they're legally required to,

420
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,250
to,
to take certain actions and certain 

421
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,091
circumstances and they,
their medical license and their whole 

422
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:00,250
career could be at risk if they don't do
that.

423
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,800
So even if they question,
for example,

424
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:07,150
prescribing statens to a patient who has
a total cholesterol of 2:40

425
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:09,820
but no other risk factors.
If they don't do that,

426
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,420
then they could actually lose their job.
And so,

427
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,490
so it's,
it's not,

428
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm not being critical of individual 
doctors here.

429
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:21,580
I'm criticizing the whole system that 
we've created that,

430
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:26,650
that I know many doctors,
I trained doctors and I know many 

431
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,931
doctors and I can say that most of them 
are aware that the way that we're doing 

432
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:33,070
things is not working and they want to 
change it as much as anybody else,

433
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:38,071
but they feel constrained by the system.
And then the other problem is,

434
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,380
you know,
us as individuals,

435
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,790
like the level of responsibility for our
own health that we take.

436
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,350
And I think,
you know,

437
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,000
this,
we were,

438
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,470
we all ultimately are responsible.
So,

439
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,960
so let,
let me just say that,

440
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:57,460
but it's also true that we're influenced
by the system that we are part of.

441
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,170
And so,
uh,

442
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,760
you know,
you,

443
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,800
you get this whole culture which is 
basically oriented around disease 

444
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,900
management and suppressing symptoms with
drugs.

445
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:11,901
And that's what patients come to expect.
And so I've heard from many doctors and 

446
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:16,891
there've actually been studies on this 
so that patients will go in to the 

447
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:19,210
doctor and they'll,
they'll request a drug and they won't be

448
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:22,420
satisfied unless they leave with a 
prescription for that drug,

449
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:27,421
whether it's indicated for them or not.
And this is because we're one of only 

450
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:29,950
two countries in the world that has 
direct to consumer drug advertising,

451
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,490
the US and New Zealand and only two 
countries in the whole world that allow 

452
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:40,350
ads in magazines that are targeted 
towards consumers for drugs and the risk

453
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,360
in doing this is exactly what we're 
talking about now.

454
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,180
You get someone who's seen a drug ad in 
a magazine.

455
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:47,410
They're like,
I need that drug.

456
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,570
They go into the doctor,
they ask for it.

457
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,550
The doctor knows it's not right for 
them,

458
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,240
but the patient's not going to be 
satisfied unless they get that 

459
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,631
prescription.
So the doctor caves and gives them that 

460
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:00,631
prescription.

461
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:01,980
I did not know we were one of two 
countries in the whole world.

462
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,290
I thought new New Zealand was a little 
more on the ball.

463
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,430
It's surprising in a way that New 
Zealand,

464
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,400
you're a stupid as we are,
but yeah,

465
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:12,810
that's.
That's a giant problem.

466
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:14,790
The did that advertising model.
Well,

467
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,120
advertising is a giant problem period 
for people because we're so susceptible 

468
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,120
to influence

469
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:25,450
and they've shown this with food in 
particular that you know this the 

470
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:27,990
advert,
the big,

471
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,260
there's big Pharma and there's big food 
and big food.

472
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:36,261
Capital B,
capital F is this whole industrial food 

473
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:40,311
production system that is invested in 
selling us crap and they are well aware 

474
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,640
of how,
you know,

475
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,690
they study how to do this,
so they have food scientists on staff 

476
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,920
that study the palatability and reward 
value of food.

477
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:52,950
This is like technical stuff like how 
foods stimulates the,

478
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,670
the reward centers in our brain and 
that,

479
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,480
that pringles add hope,
bet you can't just eat one.

480
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,050
They will win that bet because they 
have,

481
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,110
you know,
scientists on staff that have engineered

482
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:10,550
that food to make sure that you do eat 
more than just one because they,

483
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,580
they,
they study things like mouth feel and 

484
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,700
all of the different things that go into
stimulating the reward centers in our 

485
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,590
brain to make us eat more than we 
should.

486
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,030
And so we are being manipulated and you 
know,

487
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,850
we have a responsibility to see that and
to get beyond it.

488
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,540
I'm not saying it's not a cop out,
you know,

489
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,070
people aren't responsible for their 
actions,

490
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:35,570
but it's,
you know,

491
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:36,620
there's more to it.
We're,

492
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:41,621
we're,
we're in this environment where we're 

493
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:41,621
being consistently manipulated every 
day.

494
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:44,270
It is very sneaky.
The pringles things in particular.

495
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,710
Absolutely.
I mean,

496
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,750
there,
Ryan pulled that out there.

497
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:50,220
I think about like if you had a plate 
and there's a,

498
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:55,290
you have a baked potato with no salt or 
butter on one plate and then you've got 

499
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,470
another plate and it's potato.
It's pringles.

500
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,030
What do you think you're going to eat 
more of?

501
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:04,031
I mean it's just,
these are hardwired evolutionary 

502
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:04,031
mechanisms.
We,

503
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:04,031
we're,
we're,

504
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:08,050
we're hardwired to seek out novelty 
variety because it would ensure in an,

505
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,720
in a preindustrial food environment that
kind of hard wiring would actually be a 

506
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:19,601
selective advantage,
meaning it would help us survive in a 

507
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,960
Paleolithic type of environment because 
we would seek out foods that had a 

508
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,861
variety of flavors,
usually different flavors means 

509
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:26,861
different kinds of nutrients.

510
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:28,720
So we would,
uh,

511
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,270
someone who had that kind of programming
would be more likely to survive.

512
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:37,330
But when you take that evolutionary 
programming that was designed when we 

513
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,570
are living in a,
you know,

514
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,580
in a payload Olympic type of 
environment,

515
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:44,390
and you transfer that into this modern 
environment that we live in where you've

516
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:49,391
got the 7:11
on every corner with Doritos and big 

517
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:54,410
Gulps and candy and all this stuff.
It's a total unmitigated disaster.

518
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,090
Well,
that environment,

519
00:25:56,091 --> 00:25:59,750
that environment of like a seven slash 
11 when you go in there and there's just

520
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,840
zero healthy choices and all of it is 
sugar drinks and these fucked up snacks 

521
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:08,330
that have no nutrients.
And I'm like,

522
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,420
yeah,
that it's,

523
00:26:09,421 --> 00:26:14,421
it's such a bizarre common place that 
you can just pull into any one of those 

524
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,430
things.
There's so many of them and they're just

525
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:20,570
overwhelmed with unhealthy choices all 
over the world to now and you know,

526
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:24,820
we've exported our crap to all of these 
other countries in the world and,

527
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:26,690
and pretty much any country.

528
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,530
I mean,
I,

529
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,740
in my twenties,
I traveled all over the world surfing 

530
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,160
and I was shocked at,
you know,

531
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:38,230
I'd,
I'd be in this really remote place in 

532
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,690
Indonesia and I'd see like a coca cola 
barge going,

533
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,720
going by from island to island in this 
little archipelago where there was 

534
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:43,720
nothing,
you know,

535
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,110
just huts on every assignment,
but then you come up to this little hut 

536
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,740
and there'd be like a thing of coca cola
bottles,

537
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,420
you know,
crazy.

538
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,340
And we've managed to export this 
everywhere and it's just,

539
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,800
you know,
people,

540
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:04,070
uh,
it's hard to go against evolutionary 

541
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,230
programming because this,
it's real and it's until unconscious.

542
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:08,670
It's,
it's below the,

543
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,080
the cognitive center of our brain where 
we can rationally think about it.

544
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:18,081
I mean,
you mentioned before people who are 

545
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:18,081
overweight but don't make healthy 
choices,

546
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:21,270
that's not because they don't 
intellectually understand that they need

547
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:26,271
to make healthy choices.
It's that they're fighting against this 

548
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,720
deeply hardwired programming that is 
totally incompatible with the modern 

549
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:33,350
food environment that we have and you 
know,

550
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:38,390
for whatever reason,
some people are more successful at 

551
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,420
getting past that than others.

552
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,620
Yeah.
About being able to attach 

553
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:44,620
intellectually detached from the 
instincts where you,

554
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,430
you know,
for a fact that all these things are 

555
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,050
definitely bad for you.
Even though there's a compelling desire 

556
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,710
to take them in,
they have this ability to step back.

557
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,460
Yeah.
It's,

558
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,340
that's,
that's sort of a learn thing.

559
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,790
It's a learn thing,
you know?

560
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,400
It's not a natural thing.
I mean,

561
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:03,090
if you it,
what's more natural is to see something 

562
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,200
that you crave and to eat and to eat it 
or drink it.

563
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,490
I mean not that is a natural animal 
human experience.

564
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,480
What's less natural is to see that,
feel it,

565
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,210
and then have a thought that says,
no,

566
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:18,190
this is actually not going to be good 
for me.

567
00:28:18,191 --> 00:28:20,050
And so I'm going to make a different 
choice.

568
00:28:20,051 --> 00:28:20,530
I mean,
not.

569
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,710
That's a,
that's a.

570
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,760
and I don't think it's the same.
I don't think we even experienced those 

571
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:27,940
cravings in the same way.
Like there are.

572
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,860
Um,
I mean,

573
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,140
for example,
if someone has a really screwed up gut 

574
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,620
and they've got a lot of bad bacteria or
they have some fun,

575
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,490
they have fungal overgrowth or something
going on in there,

576
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
those bacteria we now know and yeast can
produce chemicals that actually affect 

577
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,831
our brain chemistry so that someone 
who's got a disrupted gut microbiome 

578
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:53,230
might experience those cravings way more
strongly than I do.

579
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,740
And so it's harder for them to intervene
and stop that because it's almost like 

580
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:01,790
they have a,
an alien presence in,

581
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,510
in their body that is creating these 
foods.

582
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,950
And it's really hard to overcome that.

583
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:11,070
I'm glad you brought that up because 
that was one of the things I was going 

584
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,070
to bring up next.
Um,

585
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,100
the idea that your gut biome actually 
controls your cravings and controls 

586
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:19,381
your,
your desires for things and also when 

587
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:23,221
you cure that up or when you heal it and
you start taking in healthy probiotics,

588
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,100
your desires for different foods sort of
emerge for me over the last few years,

589
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:35,410
like say three years plus I've really 
gotten into probiotics,

590
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,220
got really heavily into drinking 
Kombucha on a daily basis.

591
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:44,221
And then I started eating a lot of Chee 
and a lot of fermented cabbage and then 

592
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:46,720
it became Kiefer and a lot of other 
different things.

593
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:51,721
And now I take on it total gut health 
package with every food that I eat every

594
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:58,561
time I eat something.
And I think that like really 

595
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:00,700
concentrating on probiotics has boosted 
my immune system.

596
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:04,660
I'm very rarely sick if I'm sick,
even though I travel so much.

597
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,120
If I'm sick,
it's for very short amount of time.

598
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:12,180
Right.
And then I snapped back pretty quickly 

599
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,150
and my desire for sugary foods is almost
nonexistent unless I'm drunk or I just 

600
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:23,191
want to indulge.
But like I used to have this massive 

601
00:30:23,191 --> 00:30:26,050
desire all the time to eat like a 
sandwich or eat a bowl of pasta or,

602
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,370
and now I look at it and if it's not 
even really food like it,

603
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,290
my mind has sort of reached a tipping 
point.

604
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,350
And then also my,
my gut biome,

605
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:40,351
I believe.
I mean I'm just guessing has changed 

606
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:40,960
where like if someone is a piece of cake
laying around,

607
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,730
I don't look at that piece of cake and 
go,

608
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,170
God,
I got to stuff that in my face.

609
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,050
I look at it and go,
that is a lot of problems.

610
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:49,810
That's a lot of sugar.
That's a lot of not good for you.

611
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:54,990
I'm going to,
it's going to give me some mouth 

612
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:54,990
pleasure and then I'm going to feel 
fucking terrible our

613
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,930
right.
Yeah.

614
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,760
No,
I think that's all true.

615
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:01,030
All supported by the research.
There's a lot of research now on the gut

616
00:31:01,031 --> 00:31:06,031
brain access which recognizes the bi 
directional connection between the gut 

617
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,330
and the brain.
So in other words,

618
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,960
how the health of our gut and our gut 
microbiome directly influences brain 

619
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,080
chemistry.
Likewise,

620
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:19,081
our brain chemistry,
I directly influences our gut so it can 

621
00:31:19,081 --> 00:31:22,030
work in both directions.
So if you're under severe stress,

622
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:27,031
for example,
I think most people recognize the 

623
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:30,010
phrases,
butterflies in my stomach before you go 

624
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:30,400
onstage and perform,
that you feel that,

625
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,240
you know,
I don't know if you experienced that now

626
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,410
since he performed so much.
Do you still,

627
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,390
do you still get the.
Something's really important.

628
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:38,170
Like I'm going to do a

629
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:43,270
yeah,
comedy special that I'm gonna fail or 

630
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,921
something like that and I get like a 
little nervous most of the time you 

631
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:45,060
just,
it's a heightened sense of like,

632
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,610
okay,
here we go right now.

633
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,490
But when you were about to do something 
that's scary,

634
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,960
your pants right.
There's another less for fine example of

635
00:31:53,961 --> 00:31:58,961
the gut brain connection.
So it's been in our lexicon for a long 

636
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,860
time.
So I think like on a popular basis,

637
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,540
most people are like,
Duh.

638
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,310
Yeah,
I know my brain's connected,

639
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:07,130
my gut.
But it's only been in the last 20,

640
00:32:07,131 --> 00:32:09,950
30 years that the research has really 
come around to,

641
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,280
you know,
clarifying what those relationships are.

642
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,430
So,
um,

643
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,020
we know that changes in the gut 
microbiome can affect our brain 

644
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,700
chemistry and in fact,
the,

645
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,570
the,
uh,

646
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,090
the prevailing theory now of what 
actually causes depression is called the

647
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:28,670
inflammatory cytokine model of 
depression.

648
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:34,060
And so it's not the thing that,
where your serotonin levels are 

649
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,110
different than you know,
and,

650
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:39,111
and that's why you're depressed.
It's that you have inflammation 

651
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:42,400
primarily in the gut and inflammatory 
cytokines travel from your gut through 

652
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,420
the bloodstream,
up into your brain,

653
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,740
across the blood brain barrier.

654
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,740
And they suppress the activity in the 
frontal cortex which basically causes 

655
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,800
the symptoms of depression.
So there's,

656
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,690
there's,
this is totally mainstream,

657
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:57,470
not fringe science,
where they recognize that depression may

658
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:01,070
be caused and anxiety may be caused by 
inflammation in the gut.

659
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:06,670
So this is where the direction of 
science has been heading up.

660
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,520
And then,
you know,

661
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,880
it stands to reason that if you take 
probiotics,

662
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:14,480
you eat fermented foods,
you eat fermentable fibers that grow,

663
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:17,720
help feed the beneficial bacteria that 
are already in your gut.

664
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,240
You can influence that bank brain 
chemistry.

665
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:23,150
And so not only change your mood,
you know,

666
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,020
potentially heal depression and anxiety.
And then even,

667
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,090
you know,
cognitive behavioral disorders,

668
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:34,091
Adhd and things like that,
but you could also profoundly changed 

669
00:33:34,091 --> 00:33:38,410
the creating of food that you have 
because if pathogenic bacteria feed on 

670
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:42,980
sugar,
so you may not just be dealing with your

671
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:47,981
own cravings when you're craving sugar,
you're dealing with the cravings of 

672
00:33:47,981 --> 00:33:47,981
those pathogenic bacteria.

673
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:53,170
We know there are examples in nature of 
bacteria and microorganisms changing the

674
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:58,340
behavior of their host in order to 
propagate their own survival.

675
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,300
So,
uh,

676
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,920
I'm,
I'm probably gonna Butcher,

677
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:03,050
I don't remember the exact species,
but,

678
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,620
um,
it's a parasite that gets into a 

679
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,160
particular insect and aquatic wildlife.
There's that.

680
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,070
And there's one,
a land one that causes it to crawl up to

681
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:18,071
the top of a blade of grass where it can
then be eaten by the ultimate host that,

682
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,860
that parasite wants to get into.
Yeah.

683
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,000
And I'm not remembering the exact 
species,

684
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:26,710
but there's a biologist know that 
microorganisms can,

685
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,550
can change our,
our behavior.

686
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:33,610
And,
and we like to think that we're not 

687
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,861
animals,
but we're subject to these same 

688
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:35,861
influences.
Oh,

689
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:35,861
100 percent.
I mean,

690
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:38,720
it is a very bizarre distinction that we
want to think we're people,

691
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,820
we're not animals,
we're special.

692
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:42,940
We,
if we've evolved beyond being animal

693
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,430
switch,
it's cute.

694
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,200
It's nice to think,
and it's nice to separate ourselves 

695
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:50,200
because we're conscious and we're aware 
of our actions and,

696
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,040
and that,
those are all absolutely correct,

697
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:54,350
but we're just a heightened state of 
animal life.

698
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,760
Absolutely.
End of the day.

699
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,620
We're subject to the same influences,
right?

700
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,440
I think so,
and I think it causes a lot of harm to 

701
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,440
see ourselves as separate.

702
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,000
I think you're right.
The term leaky gut,

703
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,520
what does that mean?
When people hear leaky gut,

704
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,410
they've heard it a bunch of times.
Um,

705
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:14,430
it's,
it's something that gets talked about a 

706
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,991
lot when people deal with in quote 
unquote gut health and probiotics,

707
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:19,190
like what does,
what is leaky gut mean?

708
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:25,120
So this is a,
this is an interesting example of how,

709
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,450
of what happens in research over time.
So you know,

710
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,480
20 or 30 years ago if you went,
if you were like a medical conference 

711
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,261
and you use the term leaky gut,
you would have been laughed out of the 

712
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:38,261
room,
you know,

713
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,711
it was really the province of 
alternative medicine providers and 

714
00:35:41,711 --> 00:35:42,660
quacks.
And yet today,

715
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:44,900
if you go search on pub med,
you know,

716
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,020
the major clearinghouse of,
of medical studies,

717
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,200
you can find thousands and thousands of 
articles on leaky gut.

718
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,720
It will be actually talked about with 
the term intestinal permeability.

719
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,640
And so what,
what this means is a,

720
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,740
it,
if you,

721
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,960
it's kind of interesting think about 
this,

722
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,780
but your intestine is bake is basically 
a,

723
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,710
uh,
it's a,

724
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,860
it's a hollow tube that goes from your 
mouth to your anus and anything inside 

725
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,410
the intestine is technically outside of 
the body.

726
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,500
Really.
It's weird to think of that way,

727
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,530
but if you have a tube that's going all 
the way through your body and anything 

728
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:25,110
that's inside that tube is not actually 
inside your body.

729
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,550
Whoa.
Yeah.

730
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,160
So the,
the tubes job is to decide what gets 

731
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,611
inside of the body and what stays out 
because anything that doesn't get 

732
00:36:37,611 --> 00:36:39,990
absorbed just gets eliminated as waste 
without ever getting into your body.

733
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,380
And we couldn't survive if we didn't 
have this ability to discern friend from

734
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:50,931
foe.
It's supposed to let nutrients that we 

735
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:51,780
need in,
but keep toxins and other wastes out.

736
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,090
Right?
So that's the,

737
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:53,760
the,
the,

738
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:57,540
one of the fundamental purposes of the 
gut barriers to it,

739
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:02,490
it's other guide is to be a barrier.
Basically diarrhea when you're not well,

740
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,020
exactly.
Clear that stuff out.

741
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,240
Let's go everybody,
everybody,

742
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:08,400
everybody out right away.
So,

743
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:09,200
um,
the,

744
00:37:09,201 --> 00:37:11,040
the,
the guide is primarily a barrier.

745
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:16,580
It's a barrier system and when,
when that's working well it opens and 

746
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,280
closes appropriately.
And so,

747
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:17,790
you know,
oh,

748
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:18,630
nutrient,
okay,

749
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:21,620
open,
let that in talks and waste closed.

750
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,300
Don't let that in.
Uh,

751
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,240
and,
and so everyone's gut is permeable in an

752
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:28,750
appropriate way,
right?

753
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,810
When it's working well,
because if it wasn't permeable,

754
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:33,450
it wouldn't be,
we would die,

755
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,220
we wouldn't be able to absorb nutrients.
Um,

756
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:42,020
but the other side of that spectrum is 
if it stops being permeable at the right

757
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:47,301
times and starts letting things in that 
shouldn't be in there in the first 

758
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:49,230
place.
That's what's called leaky gut.

759
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,400
You know,
you basically have an inability to to 

760
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,550
keep out stuff that's not supposed to 
get into your body.

761
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,990
And then like so some of some examples 
would be large protein molecules.

762
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:05,991
Typically we digest protein into small 
peptides that our immune system doesn't 

763
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:11,901
recognize it as foreign invaders and is 
able to use to grow muscle and do all 

764
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:15,480
the things that protein helps us to do.
But if large protein molecules that have

765
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:19,470
not been properly digested,
sneak into the bloodstream,

766
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:25,190
our body rec sees those things as 
foreign presence and creates antibodies 

767
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,100
to attack them.

768
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,880
And that's why we develop food allergies
or food intolerances.

769
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,840
Another thing that gets through the gut 
that shouldn't is called endotoxins.

770
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:38,230
So these are toxins produced by a 
certain species of bacteria.

771
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,970
Things like lipopolysaccharide and they 
can get through the gut barrier and then

772
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:47,971
our body produces antibodies to them and
attacks them as if they're foreign 

773
00:38:47,971 --> 00:38:48,820
invaders,
which they are in that case,

774
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:50,560
they shouldn't be in there in the first 
place.

775
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,240
And all of this basically creates a 
systemic inflammatory response.

776
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,980
So,
um,

777
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,780
you know,
whether it's food antigens that are 

778
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,441
getting in there that shouldn't be,
or whether it's back bacterial 

779
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:07,561
endotoxins that are getting in there,
that shouldn't be leaky gut leads to 

780
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:11,221
this chronic low grade infection,
inflammation and basically all modern 

781
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:14,950
diseases that kill us like diabetes,
heart disease,

782
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:20,430
uh,
even some of the ones we've already 

783
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:20,710
talked about,
depression doesn't necessarily kill us,

784
00:39:20,711 --> 00:39:23,410
but all of the mental and behavioral 
diseases,

785
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,120
autoimmune disease,
which now in fact one in four women and 

786
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,440
one in six men,
just crazy.

787
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:35,441
And given that they don't really exist 
in traditional hunter gatherer 

788
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:38,400
societies,
all of these are inflammatory 

789
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,400
conditions.
So,

790
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,800
uh,
something that contributes to 

791
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,731
inflammation is going to significantly 
increase our risk of acquiring one of 

792
00:39:44,731 --> 00:39:48,901
these diseases.
And then eventually dying from one of 

793
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:48,901
them.
Now when we say inflammation,

794
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:50,560
that's another term that people here 
really,

795
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,880
but I don't think they necessarily 
understand.

796
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,020
It's along the lines of

797
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,420
it.
So like you did an awesome job clearing 

798
00:39:59,420 --> 00:39:59,570
the thing for me too.
It's solidified,

799
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,930
but inflammation.

800
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,080
Why is inflammation caused by sugars?
Why's it caused by simple sugars and 

801
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,250
corn syrup and things on those lines.
Too much simple carbohydrates,

802
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,110
like what is,
what is causing that?

803
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,920
So there's this great paper published a 
few years ago by a professor from New 

804
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,990
Zealand,
actually Ian Spread,

805
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:24,400
Barry,
I think is his name.

806
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,580
Um,
forgive me if I'm not getting that right

807
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,260
in,
but he,

808
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,770
a distinguished between two different 
types of carbohydrates,

809
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,240
a cellular and cellular,
a cellular meaning lacking cell membrane

810
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:42,690
and a cellular carbs are carbs that have
been heavily processed where their 

811
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,080
natural cells that would be found in a 
plant,

812
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,640
in a whole plant,
like a start,

813
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:50,641
like a sweet potato or a potato or 
something like that have been broken 

814
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:54,670
down in the processing.
So you have white flour for example.

815
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,560
Um,
you know,

816
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,220
originally came from a whole wheat plant
that had its cells intact,

817
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:04,230
but then it's been the seed or the 
kernel of the whole wheat has been 

818
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:08,170
removed and you just have the starch 
with no cell cells anymore.

819
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,840
And what that means is,
um,

820
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,700
with,
with cellular carbohydrates,

821
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:17,701
our body has to really work to break 
those down and the actual glucose,

822
00:41:17,871 --> 00:41:22,871
the carbohydrate itself is relatively 
inaccessible because we have to work so 

823
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:23,650
hard to digest it and get at it.

824
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:27,760
If you think of an analogy like a nut,
you know,

825
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:29,440
like a whole walnut,
it,

826
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,100
you know,
you have to do a lot to get to that.

827
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,090
So it's gonna be hard to overeat those,
um,

828
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:41,170
in a,
in a kind of a traditional setting 

829
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:41,840
because there's so much work involved at
getting at it.

830
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,560
Whereas if you have a bag of walnuts 
from trader Joe's that have already been

831
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:46,650
shelled and,
and,

832
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,680
and they're just sitting there salted,
you can just pound a whole bunch of 

833
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,100
those.
So with this,

834
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:57,190
a cellular carbohydrate,
it's basically the equivalent of 

835
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:01,061
removing the shells from the nuts and 
just making those carbohydrates super 

836
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:04,631
accessible.
Not only to us but to the bacteria in 

837
00:42:04,631 --> 00:42:08,771
our gut,
and so his argument was that when we eat

838
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:11,840
a lot of processed and refined sugars 
that are,

839
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,700
that are highly accessible to to to us 
and also to our gut bacteria,

840
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:21,701
we basically create an imbalance in the 
gut where you have a proliferation of 

841
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:25,601
bad pathogenic bacteria that thrive on 
sugar and a reduction of good bacteria 

842
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,770
that we need to be healthy and not 
imbalanced.

843
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:35,771
Then creates an inflammatory gut 
microbiota and as I described before 

844
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:39,080
that those inflammatory cytokines that 
are produced in the gut,

845
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:42,920
they can travel out from the gut and 
affect the whole body systemically.

846
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,110
So you know,
25 years,

847
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,880
100 years ago,
hippocrates said,

848
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:49,430
all disease begins in the gut and he 
didn't know,

849
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,450
you know,
any.

850
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:53,540
He didn't have any of this modern 
science that we have now that shows that

851
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:54,500
this is true,
but he,

852
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:56,080
it turns out that he,
he was right.

853
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,420
That's fascinating that people have 
these ancients sayings like,

854
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:04,421
follow your heart.
And then we found out like fairly 

855
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:05,720
recently,
within the last few decades at the heart

856
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:07,270
is filled with neurons.
Right?

857
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,360
And that there might actually be some 
sort of memory or thinking,

858
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:14,720
you know,
quote unquote going on in your heart

859
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:20,130
and then having a sense of purpose is 
associated with greater longevity and 

860
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,250
better health,
which is also following your heart.

861
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,430
Very strange sort of sentiments that 
turned out to be like,

862
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:31,910
you think of them as just sort of old 
tales or old things that people say old 

863
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:37,821
expressions,
but they turn out to actually have some 

864
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:37,821
basis in fact,
almost instinctually

865
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:42,820
I think we're,
we're kind of recovering lost knowledge 

866
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,821
at this point in a lot of ways and,
but we're recovering it in different 

867
00:43:45,821 --> 00:43:45,821
way.
Like we're,

868
00:43:45,821 --> 00:43:50,550
we're using modern scientific tools to 
validate or clarify ancient wisdom 

869
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:55,460
that's been around for a long time and I
think they both have a place.

870
00:43:55,461 --> 00:44:00,461
And,
and I personally think it's fascinating 

871
00:44:00,461 --> 00:44:00,730
to learn what the mechanisms are that 
explained that,

872
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,750
that wisdom in those sayings.
But I think we can sometimes be too 

873
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,000
quick to dismiss that wisdom as being 
like,

874
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,550
you know,
silly or stupid or not nonscientific.

875
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,050
Yeah.
I,

876
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,090
I definitely think.
Well,

877
00:44:15,091 --> 00:44:20,091
I think it's very important that we 
today in this day have the tools to use 

878
00:44:21,531 --> 00:44:26,531
science to sort of explain unequivocably
why these things are factors in why 

879
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:29,960
these things exist and that we've proven
in these studies.

880
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,440
These are peer reviewed.
Here we go.

881
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:33,210
Here's the studies.
It showed that.

882
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,220
Oh yeah,
well there's neurons in the heart.

883
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,350
Oh yeah.
Well that makes sense.

884
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,500
You think that way?
Oh,

885
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:39,210
there's biome.
There's a,

886
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:44,220
there's actually like organisms and I 
think the way you described as great 

887
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,930
that there's like an alien living inside
you that wants sugar because it really 

888
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,140
kind of is that there's organisms in our
body.

889
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:49,710
I got,
I,

890
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,630
I heard it explained once.
I never forgot it,

891
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:57,050
that there's more eco lie living inside 
your gut than there have ever been 

892
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:57,870
people ever.

893
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,130
Right?
Yeah.

894
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:04,131
And there are more microorganisms in our
gut than there are stars in the 

895
00:45:04,131 --> 00:45:05,970
universe.
I think some crazy stuff.

896
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,540
So that's where I step in and say,
how's that possible?

897
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,630
It doesn't make any sense.
The Universe is infinite.

898
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:13,770
Right?
Well,

899
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:14,850
there is that.
I mean,

900
00:45:14,851 --> 00:45:16,770
I think that was the,
the early conception.

901
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:21,771
They're not,
they maybe haven't read about the 

902
00:45:21,771 --> 00:45:21,771
multiverse theories.
Yeah.

903
00:45:21,771 --> 00:45:21,771
Because someone

904
00:45:21,771 --> 00:45:23,450
who's like enormous,
like Ralphie May,

905
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,730
he has more cells,
right?

906
00:45:25,731 --> 00:45:26,590
So he is,
he's a,

907
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,310
he's a bigger universe.
Like how does that work?

908
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:33,870
Well,
what you said about science is really 

909
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:33,870
true and I mean I love science.
I'm dead.

910
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:38,180
I'm going,
I spend most of my days in interacting 

911
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,611
with science in some way and I think 
it's worth pointing out that there is 

912
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:45,411
some real um,
problems with the way science is 

913
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:48,670
conducted today and uh,
I think we run the risk of,

914
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,920
you know,
of worshiping like the randomized 

915
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,911
clinical trial and at the expense of 
other kinds of knowledge that can be 

916
00:45:56,911 --> 00:45:59,280
just as important or more important in,
in certain ways.

917
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:04,910
Well,
one of the things that you brought up 

918
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,621
that I think is very important is who is
funding some of these trials on 

919
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:13,341
pharmaceutical drugs and the efficacy of
them and how they profit off of it and 

920
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:17,811
how,
how many studies are sort of thrown out 

921
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:17,811
that don't fit the narrative.

922
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:20,520
The file drawer phenomenon.
Yeah.

923
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,520
Explain that.
Well,

924
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:27,400
so two thirds of medical research is 
funded by big Pharma and that makes,

925
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,940
yeah,
two thirds.

926
00:46:28,941 --> 00:46:30,430
So,
um,

927
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,230
you know,
this is just human nature.

928
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:38,650
Upton Sinclair said it's difficult to 
get a man to understand something when 

929
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:40,340
his salary depends on him not 
understanding it.

930
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:43,880
It's one of my favorite quotes because 
it explains a lot,

931
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,740
right?
And,

932
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:50,970
um,
so you can look at it just in terms of 

933
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,230
basic human nature,
like if you're a researcher,

934
00:46:51,231 --> 00:46:53,690
you're being funded by a pharmaceutical 
company,

935
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,210
you know,
you know,

936
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,550
even if it's not conscious,
there's a subconscious thing there where

937
00:46:58,551 --> 00:47:03,260
you know that if your results are 
negative and don't support that drug,

938
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:08,380
you're less likely to get the next,
your next project funded and you're a 

939
00:47:09,681 --> 00:47:11,390
human being.
You want to have a job,

940
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,490
you want,
you want your work to be funded.

941
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,030
I mean,
that's,

942
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,550
it's really easy to understand,
right?

943
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:20,720
It's not like these are bad people who 
are all like in conspiracy to,

944
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:21,890
to,
um,

945
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,680
push drugs on us.
I think most researchers are good,

946
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,780
good people and trying to do the right 
thing.

947
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,590
Um,
but it's a way that the system set up,

948
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:34,600
that's the problem where they need to 
depend on pharmaceutical companies for 

949
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,860
their funding and it's really hard,
you know,

950
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,170
don't bite the hand that feeds you.
It's just,

951
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:39,320
it's,
it's a time,

952
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,650
you know,
the age old saying,

953
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,440
and there's a lot to that.
Um,

954
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:51,270
up until recently,
I think there've been some recent 

955
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:51,270
changes here,
but,

956
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:51,880
uh,
researchers,

957
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:56,881
we're not required.
A pharmaceutical companies were not 

958
00:47:56,881 --> 00:47:59,310
required to publish negative results.
So if they did a drug trial and the 

959
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,280
results didn't support the drug,
it turned out that placebo,

960
00:48:01,281 --> 00:48:05,740
it was more effective or you know,
their drug had side effects that made it

961
00:48:05,741 --> 00:48:08,260
not,
not usable.

962
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:13,290
They,
those studies just basically go into 

963
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,320
file drawer that they wouldn't actually 
be published in a journal.

964
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,290
And there's been a movement to change 
that to where,

965
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,780
you know,
if a study is conducted,

966
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:23,470
it needs to be registered and then no 
matter what the results are,

967
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:28,530
they need to be published so that people
have a chance to see not just the 

968
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,080
positive results that support the drug 
trials.

969
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:32,350
But the ones that didn't.
It'd be nice if that was retroactive,

970
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,660
right?
Um,

971
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:37,120
but then there are other problems like 
fraud and so,

972
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:42,210
uh,
there was a pretty big study published 

973
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,421
in Jama a little while back by Java is 
Journal of American Medical Association,

974
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:50,611
you know,
very prominent prestigious journal and 

975
00:48:50,611 --> 00:48:53,551
it was a guy named Charles siefert and 
he basically looked at the FDA,

976
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,360
a monitoring of drug trials.
So the FDA's job,

977
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:04,150
one of their jobs is to make sure that 
the trial is being done to,

978
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,520
uh,
determine whether a medication is 

979
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:09,520
effective or done the way they should be
and that,

980
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,430
you know,
there's no falsification of patient data

981
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:14,310
or,
and that patients are being there,

982
00:49:14,311 --> 00:49:19,311
their health is being protected 
adequately and there's no fraud going 

983
00:49:19,311 --> 00:49:19,311
on.

984
00:49:19,311 --> 00:49:23,700
So what he found was that in a,
in a shocking number of cases where 

985
00:49:23,771 --> 00:49:28,771
there was fraud,
where the FDA actually I did identify 

986
00:49:28,771 --> 00:49:31,780
fraud and it was serious enough that 
they took action in 96 percent of cases,

987
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:36,550
the action that they took was not 
reported in any scientific journal.

988
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,580
So let me give you a few examples.
Like in one case,

989
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,180
a researcher changed patient data to 
hide the patient had preexisting kidney 

990
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:50,281
and liver problems and they gave this 
guy chemotherapy treatment and he died 

991
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:55,310
and then the researcher ended up 
spending six years in jail and that was 

992
00:49:55,310 --> 00:50:00,061
never mentioned in the study that was 
based on that trial data lake that was 

993
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:02,200
later published.
So that's one example.

994
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,890
Another example I did they do that.
What was the most note?

995
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,670
There's no,
uh,

996
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
the motivation is to get the drug 
approved and why would they hide the 

997
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,960
fact that this guy,
that the FDA doesn't require companies,

998
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:22,620
pharmaceutical companies to publish that
data and because they say in their 

999
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:26,410
language and according to,
to see for it in this paper,

1000
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:31,990
it's more essentially more important to 
the FDA to protect the commercial 

1001
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,530
interests of these companies than it is 
to protect public health.

1002
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:38,860
Even though this is an agency that is 
ostensibly there to protect public 

1003
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:38,860
health,

1004
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,910
skype.
So maybe I'm getting it wrong.

1005
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:45,160
He had preexisting liver disease,

1006
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:50,830
liver and kidney issues and cancer and a
researcher thought changed,

1007
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:57,220
falsified his data and covered up that 
he,

1008
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:02,610
that,
that this was known when he was given 

1009
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:02,610
this chemotherapy drug.

1010
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:05,960
But why would they do that?
I just don't understand why they would 

1011
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,450
cover up the fact that it guy was 
already sick.

1012
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:11,690
Like,
wouldn't you think that that would be 

1013
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:11,690
the opposite?

1014
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:14,370
Let me use another example because I 
think this will help show what's 

1015
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:18,540
happening here.
So there was a Chinese site,

1016
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,720
you know,
most drug trials,

1017
00:51:19,721 --> 00:51:24,070
they take place at different sites,
so they have multiple locations that are

1018
00:51:24,071 --> 00:51:27,040
testing so that they can get data on 
different populations,

1019
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,150
you know,
not just in white Americans,

1020
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,970
also Chinese people.
And so they do it different centers.

1021
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:38,971
And so there was a,
it was a trial for an anticoagulant 

1022
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:38,971
drug.
Um,

1023
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:40,520
and,
uh,

1024
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:45,720
they found that this Chinese center had 
falsified a whole bunch of patient data 

1025
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,831
and change the results.
And if they took that Chinese center's 

1026
00:51:49,831 --> 00:51:51,820
data out of the equation,
that drug would have failed.

1027
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,940
It wouldn't have been more effective 
than placebo.

1028
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,230
But even though the FDA busted this 
group in China,

1029
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:02,830
the study that was published on that 
drug,

1030
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:08,150
it's still included that data from the 
study in China and even studies that 

1031
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,950
were being published 18 months later,
still included that data in the original

1032
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:12,610
data set.

1033
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:16,540
So the FDA busted them,
it was clear that they had falsified the

1034
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:20,770
data and yet that data is still being 
included in the studies that doctors are

1035
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:25,771
relying on all over the world to make 
decisions about whether to prescribe 

1036
00:52:25,771 --> 00:52:27,260
these drugs.
So there's,

1037
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,800
there's fraud happening and whether 
it's,

1038
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:34,860
you know,
from financial interests or just human 

1039
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,141
error that's not actually being reported
and translating into clinical decisions 

1040
00:52:37,961 --> 00:52:39,520
that,
that doctors are making.

1041
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:43,570
So there are a lot of it.
And then the whole peer review process,

1042
00:52:43,571 --> 00:52:48,571
you mentioned peer review to a,
there was a pretty big study where,

1043
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,280
um,
the,

1044
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:51,900
the,
uh,

1045
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:57,060
paper was submitted to Bmj,
British Medical Journal and other big 

1046
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,330
medical journal with eight major errors 
and not a single one of the 221 

1047
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:01,960
scientists that were asked to review the
paper,

1048
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:06,961
caught all of the errors and only 30 
percent recommended rejecting the paper.

1049
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:12,690
And this was even more problematic 
because half of those scientists were 

1050
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,610
warned in advance,
we're going to give you a paper that has

1051
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:17,220
a lot of errors.
And,

1052
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:22,560
and the ones who were warned didn't get 
any more of the errors than the 

1053
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,180
scientists that weren't warned in 
advance.

1054
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:28,181
They broke them up into two groups.
Is that just lack of time to do the 

1055
00:53:28,181 --> 00:53:29,940
research and people being overwhelmed by
a workload?

1056
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,420
I think that's probably part of it,
but it's not really an excuse.

1057
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,930
I don't know.
I mean it's,

1058
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:39,980
it's just,
it's a problem with peer review because 

1059
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:39,980
our artist,
you know,

1060
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,140
it is a big part of the scientific 
method to,

1061
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,800
to have the results validated by 
somebody else.

1062
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:49,190
Or two,
to review the work and make sure that 

1063
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,681
it's sound,
but what this paper indicated is that a 

1064
00:53:51,681 --> 00:53:54,621
lot of findings that we take to be true 
and valid might not actually be true and

1065
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:55,830
valid.

1066
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,920
And you may have heard about this.
It actually made the news,

1067
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,080
um,
there was a recent,

1068
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:06,580
the open science collaboration did a 
review of 100 psychology studies and 

1069
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,940
that had never been replicated.
Replicating findings is really important

1070
00:54:11,941 --> 00:54:16,941
in the scientific method to like if you 
design a study and you do it and you 

1071
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:18,960
have,
you find a certain result in science,

1072
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:22,560
it's not really considered to be valid 
unless I do it and,

1073
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,210
and confirm your results,
you know,

1074
00:54:24,211 --> 00:54:26,880
or someone else does.
It's independent of you.

1075
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:30,570
And in a shocking number of studies,
this never happens.

1076
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:35,630
And so they,
this group went back and looked at 100 

1077
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:36,000
psychology studies and tried to 
replicate them using the,

1078
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:41,120
you know,
almost identical conditions from the 

1079
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,120
original studies.
And in they were only able to do that in

1080
00:54:42,121 --> 00:54:45,300
35 percent of cases there.
Uh,

1081
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:50,340
another group looked at a precancer,
a clinical studies and found they could 

1082
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,320
only replicate 11 percent of those.

1083
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,710
It's a well known saying in the 
pharmaceutical world that,

1084
00:54:55,770 --> 00:55:00,770
that,
like more than half of the drug trials 

1085
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:02,250
can't be replicated and have a group of 
researchers from Bayer,

1086
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:05,910
from a pharmaceutical company tried to 
do that in 2011.

1087
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:10,940
They took a bunch of trials and try to 
replicate them less than one quarter of 

1088
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,580
them.
They were able to replicate the results.

1089
00:55:11,581 --> 00:55:14,610
So what this means is,
um,

1090
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,560
you know,
a study can be done,

1091
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:21,890
it's never validated and then a whole 
bunch of other studies are done that 

1092
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:25,761
refer to that study and whole fields of 
scientific research are spawn on a study

1093
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:32,010
that was never confirmed or validated.
So it's like a house of cards built on a

1094
00:55:32,011 --> 00:55:34,210
foundation of falsehood.
Well,

1095
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,490
so,
you know,

1096
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,030
science is great.
We need to keep improving science,

1097
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:44,031
but there's a lot of problems with the 
way that studies are performed right 

1098
00:55:44,031 --> 00:55:44,031
now.

1099
00:55:44,031 --> 00:55:44,031
And it,
it's,

1100
00:55:44,031 --> 00:55:44,730
it's both,
you know,

1101
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,760
conflicts of interest that are based on 
money and it's just also human human 

1102
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,501
error.
And is it also just the overwhelming 

1103
00:55:54,501 --> 00:55:56,691
number of studies that are being done 
and how many people would have to be 

1104
00:55:56,691 --> 00:55:56,720
there to validate all the different 
money,

1105
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:59,310
money,
money basically like a,

1106
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:04,311
I've talked to some research,
I was just talking to some researchers 

1107
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:04,311
about this and they said,
look,

1108
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:06,750
nobody wants to be the second person to 
discover something.

1109
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,150
It's just not as cool.
I mean,

1110
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:15,170
it's not as prestigious for your career.
So like going around replicating other 

1111
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:18,390
people's studies is not as exciting as 
doing your own original verbally.

1112
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:19,410
Yeah,
exactly.

1113
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:24,450
You're a cover band and you,
it's hard to get funding for it to 

1114
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:24,450
replicate studies.
Whereas

1115
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:25,990
if you find you have an original 
finding,

1116
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:30,991
especially one that's tied that 
potential therapeutic use and a drug 

1117
00:56:30,991 --> 00:56:32,860
that can be made out of that,
that's where the real money and interest

1118
00:56:32,861 --> 00:56:33,550
is.
So,

1119
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,100
um,
that's one of the big problems.

1120
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,270
And uh,
another one is just how long studies are

1121
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:44,710
done for like a omega,
Omega three fats.

1122
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:48,070
We've all heard about the,
these are good for us and you know,

1123
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,060
fish oil and all of that.
When you look at studies,

1124
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:57,061
most of those studies are really short 
term and a back in the seventies or 

1125
00:56:57,061 --> 00:57:01,531
eighties,
some longer term studies that are were 

1126
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:02,290
like eight or 10 years we're done that 
found really different results for.

1127
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,470
And what they showed is that early on 
the results for one way,

1128
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:10,471
but the longer the study went on,
the results started to go back in the 

1129
00:57:10,471 --> 00:57:11,800
other direction for Omega threes.

1130
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,440
Yeah.
We allow,

1131
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,230
we can come back to that in a second,
but um,

1132
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:20,610
the point is like,
something that happens in two weeks is 

1133
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:21,790
not necessarily what's going to happen 
over four years,

1134
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:26,850
but the problem is that the typical 
studies are only lasts for two or three 

1135
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:28,150
weeks,
especially if they're a randomized trial

1136
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:30,450
because they're enormously expensive,
you know,

1137
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,680
to isolate all the variables and make 
sure that patients are not changing too 

1138
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,110
many different things and are just doing
the intervention and to,

1139
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:43,180
you know,
to do everything that needs to be done 

1140
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:43,180
is incredibly expensive.
And,

1141
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:43,180
and so,
uh,

1142
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:48,001
we have a whole bunch of research 
findings that are based on two week 

1143
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:49,030
periods that aren't applicable to how we
live our life.

1144
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,480
That is also,
I think,

1145
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:55,500
uh,
an issue with some anecdotal reports 

1146
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:55,500
that people have about changing their 
diet.

1147
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:00,640
There's a lot of people that change 
their diet and short term they feel 

1148
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,550
fantastic and they started having all 
these benefits.

1149
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,150
But then over the course of maybe three,
four or five years or so,

1150
00:58:05,151 --> 00:58:06,680
they started having real issues

1151
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:11,980
and they don't necessarily tie that to 
the Diet because they remember feeling 

1152
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,940
so much better when they first switched 
to it.

1153
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,460
So they don't think that what they're 
going,

1154
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,230
what's happening three or four years 
later.

1155
00:58:18,231 --> 00:58:23,231
It could be the cause of their problems.
I see this all the time with vegetarian 

1156
00:58:23,231 --> 00:58:26,381
and Vegan diets.
That's exactly what I wanted to talk to 

1157
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:26,381
you about.
Yeah.

1158
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:29,930
In terms of that,
because most people who switched to a 

1159
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:34,281
vegetarian or Vegan Diet,
you're going to see some instant 

1160
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:35,130
benefits because of the fact that you 
have much more nutrient dense foods.

1161
00:58:35,131 --> 00:58:36,720
You're eating a lot of vegetables.
You're,

1162
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:41,721
you're,
you're changing your diet and a lot of 

1163
00:58:41,721 --> 00:58:42,150
ways to the positive or towards a 
positive,

1164
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:47,420
away from what you were talking about,
those primary foods that Americans tend 

1165
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,841
to eat,
all the process sugar or the just 

1166
00:58:50,841 --> 00:58:51,630
nonsense and chicken tenders and all 
that crap that people eat,

1167
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,340
which is just so goddamn common,
right,

1168
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,120
so automatically over that you're going 
to see some longterm benefits,

1169
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:02,540
but one of the things that I've been 
reading is about people that have found 

1170
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,840
that over the longterm,
the lack.

1171
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,930
This is contrary to what a lot of people
think.

1172
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:12,320
Lack of saturated fat and cholesterol,
dietary cholesterol and saturated fat 

1173
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,720
leads to hormonal imbalances,
leads to your body having a harder time 

1174
00:59:18,811 --> 00:59:23,811
producing sex hormones and all these 
different with your health or your body 

1175
00:59:24,351 --> 00:59:29,351
almost starts robbing itself to make up 
for the nutritional deficiencies of your

1176
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:30,890
diet.

1177
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:32,170
Yeah,
yeah.

1178
00:59:32,171 --> 00:59:34,330
I mean,
we talked about this before,

1179
00:59:34,331 --> 00:59:36,960
but humans are animals.
We're,

1180
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:38,560
we're,
we're omnivores.

1181
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:39,620
And wait a minute,

1182
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:44,910
I saw a video on youtube.
Here's a guy that says there's no way 

1183
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:48,541
that we're herbivores,
and then if we were some fucking wacky 

1184
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:49,070
dude was saying,
if you're really a,

1185
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,660
an Omnivore,
you should be able to eat a squirrel.

1186
00:59:52,661 --> 00:59:54,520
Just grab it and eat it raw.
And like,

1187
00:59:54,521 --> 00:59:54,820
yeah,

1188
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:58,140
no,
this was the most bizarre,

1189
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,370
some strange arguments like we shouldn't
drink milk because,

1190
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:04,290
you know,
there were the only,

1191
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,560
uh,
you know,

1192
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:10,620
we're the only animal in nature in,
in nature that drinks the milk of 

1193
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:10,620
another animal.
Yeah.

1194
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,650
Well we're the only animal nature that 
uses iphones to have a whole.

1195
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,660
It's hilarious.
He said that.

1196
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,750
What else?
Appointed people do fly planes,

1197
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:23,990
movies,
call each other on the phone and tell 

1198
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:23,990
each other how awesome milk is.
It's a ridiculous argument.

1199
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,000
But,
um,

1200
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,730
so yeah,
getting back to,

1201
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:30,690
to their ideological arguments more than
scientific.

1202
01:00:30,691 --> 01:00:31,540
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1203
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,380
So it doesn't stand up to scrutiny,
but with,

1204
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:39,420
with a vegetarian or Vegan Diet.
So there's lots of different ways to 

1205
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,741
look at this.
This starting with an evolutionary 

1206
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:42,741
perspective,
which I was getting at,

1207
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:44,130
um,
omnivores or opportunistic,

1208
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:49,160
they will eat whatever is available and 
they'll eat the most nutrient dense 

1209
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,100
foods that are available if they have a 
choice.

1210
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,210
And that's just,
again,

1211
01:00:51,211 --> 01:00:52,560
that's survival.
You know,

1212
01:00:52,561 --> 01:00:57,561
that an animal that is able to utilize 
the nutrients that are available in its 

1213
01:00:57,561 --> 01:01:01,671
environment to its maximum advantage is 
going to survive compared to one that 

1214
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:04,080
doesn't.
That's basic evolutionary theory.

1215
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:05,980
So,
um,

1216
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:09,900
if you study traditional peoples,
as far as I know,

1217
01:01:09,901 --> 01:01:13,590
still there's never been a traditional 
pe group that,

1218
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:18,690
that has ever been identified that 
voluntarily followed a Vegan or even 

1219
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:22,851
vegetarian diet that I know of.
So that should tell you something right 

1220
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:23,520
there.
And ironically,

1221
01:01:23,521 --> 01:01:26,190
the fact that you and I are even having 
this conversation,

1222
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:31,380
this wouldn't even be happening if 
humans had not learned it's eaten meat.

1223
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:36,710
Basically.
There are a lot of anthropologists who 

1224
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,640
now believe that eating meat was 
essentially what made us human.

1225
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:43,670
You know,
we came down out of the trees and we 

1226
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:46,431
develop the development of tools that 
could crack bones to give us access to 

1227
01:01:46,431 --> 01:01:50,511
the marrow,
which is super nutrient dense or to 

1228
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:53,031
sliced meat,
which allowed us to be able to digest 

1229
01:01:53,031 --> 01:01:53,031
the meat more quickly.

1230
01:01:53,031 --> 01:01:53,820
Um,
number one.

1231
01:01:53,821 --> 01:01:58,821
And then to the development of fire,
which allowed us to cook meat and 

1232
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:00,360
cooking makes the nutrients in meat more
bioavailable,

1233
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:04,020
allowed us to spend less time foraging 
for food.

1234
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:09,290
So most large primates like gorillas or 
chimpanzees spend over 80 percent of 

1235
01:02:11,221 --> 01:02:16,221
their day foraging for food because most
of the foods that we eat are really not 

1236
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:20,870
nutrient dense.
So they have to eat a boatload of stuff 

1237
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:21,630
and just sit there,
chew on the plants all day to get enough

1238
01:02:21,631 --> 01:02:22,990
nutrients.
And,

1239
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:28,100
and so this evolutionary theory is that 
we learned to extract and harvest much 

1240
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:32,580
more nutrient dense foods from animals,
fats and,

1241
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,980
and other nutrients in the meats and 
organ meats.

1242
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:40,280
And we had,
we could then spend a lot less of our 

1243
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,501
time going around getting food which 
allowed us and then develop bigger 

1244
01:02:42,501 --> 01:02:47,061
brains and you know,
become human and have this conversation 

1245
01:02:47,061 --> 01:02:49,230
where we're talking about a vegetarian 
and Vegan diets.

1246
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,280
Yeah.
It is kind of interesting.

1247
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:56,580
And it's also important to differentiate
the difference between what you're 

1248
01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:00,091
saying is essentially the science behind
the development of the human animal 

1249
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:05,160
versus the moral and ethical debates 
that lead environmental and 

1250
01:03:05,921 --> 01:03:07,660
environmental debates.
Which is awesome.

1251
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:08,760
We can,
we can,

1252
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,060
we can talk about that too.

1253
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:15,120
Which would,
which is what influences people to 

1254
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,090
become vegetarians and vegans,
which I totally respect.

1255
01:03:16,091 --> 01:03:21,091
I understand what they're saying.
The real problem is when they distort 

1256
01:03:21,091 --> 01:03:23,830
the reality of the scientific findings,
the human animal and diet.

1257
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:29,160
And that's an issue with a lot of people
that are vegetarians and vegans that go 

1258
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,240
on about how healthy they feel and about
how awesome,

1259
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:36,241
but they're not doing blood lipid 
profiles and when they do like Sam 

1260
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:40,230
Harris,
who is from an ethical perspective for 

1261
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:42,750
ethical reasons,
just tried Vegan diet and his health is 

1262
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:46,141
suffering.
He's giving real issues with his blood 

1263
01:03:46,141 --> 01:03:48,361
lipids.
What can someone do if they want to 

1264
01:03:48,361 --> 01:03:48,670
follow that diet?
Like what,

1265
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,480
what is imperative as far as healthy 
fats as far as getting,

1266
01:03:52,481 --> 01:03:57,481
making sure that your body doesn't have,
you're not taking in too many simple 

1267
01:03:57,481 --> 01:03:57,780
carbohydrates,
like what,

1268
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:02,820
what,
what steps need to be taken place and 

1269
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:03,010
this is obviously not saying that you 
shouldn't follow a Vegan diet,

1270
01:04:03,011 --> 01:04:05,260
it shouldn't follow a vegetarian diet 
and you do whatever you want to do,

1271
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:10,320
but there's gotta be some ways to 
mitigate some of the health 

1272
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:10,320
consequences,
right?

1273
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:10,320
Yeah,
there are.

1274
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:15,021
And I believe that I agree with you that
people should be free to make their own 

1275
01:04:15,021 --> 01:04:16,890
choices.
I've never pushed a particular diet.

1276
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:18,180
You know,
people sometimes ask me,

1277
01:04:18,181 --> 01:04:20,280
how do you convince someone to go Paleo?
I said,

1278
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:24,030
I don't,
I don't spend my time doing that.

1279
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:26,190
If,
if someone wants my advice and asked me,

1280
01:04:26,191 --> 01:04:28,230
I'll give it to them,
but we're not going around,

1281
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:33,290
you know,
proselytizing for a particular way of 

1282
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:33,290
eating.
Um,

1283
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:33,330
so yeah,
let's break this down.

1284
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:38,331
We talked about the evolutionary 
argument for eating animal products and 

1285
01:04:38,331 --> 01:04:41,280
there's a scientific argument which now 
is what we're talking about,

1286
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:47,510
the issue with [inaudible],
we should even kind of distinguish 

1287
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:49,560
between vegetarian and Vegan diets 
because they're actually quite different

1288
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:54,620
and I think it is possible for some 
people to be healthy with a vegetarian 

1289
01:04:56,310 --> 01:05:01,310
diet.
I think it's a lot less likely with a 

1290
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:02,520
Vegan diet and I guess I would say it 
this way.

1291
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,290
Um,
if you have,

1292
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,360
if you're Vegan and you're eating a 
Vegan Diet,

1293
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:11,361
you need to have a perfect vegan diet to
be healthy and you need to know what 

1294
01:05:11,361 --> 01:05:14,601
you're doing in terms of supplementation
and how to meet the nutrient needs that 

1295
01:05:14,601 --> 01:05:15,770
aren't being met through diet.
And it,

1296
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:20,900
at least in my experience,
there are very few that actually do it 

1297
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:20,900
right.
Um,

1298
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,950
when it's done right,
I think it's possible for some people to

1299
01:05:23,951 --> 01:05:25,930
be,
to be healthy and thrive.

1300
01:05:25,931 --> 01:05:30,100
And that's obvious because there are 
people like rich roll who's out there.

1301
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:34,420
He's a Vegan triathlete who's out there 
doing centuries and killing it,

1302
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:35,730
ultra marathon.
He,

1303
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:40,030
he is just an amazing athlete and he's 
Vegan and so,

1304
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:45,031
you know,
you can't say that it's not working for 

1305
01:05:45,031 --> 01:05:45,480
it and if you try to say that you're 
going to,

1306
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,030
it looks like he's 30.
He's like,

1307
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:49,800
yeah,
he's a,

1308
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,620
he's a great guy.

1309
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,310
I've met him a couple times.
Um,

1310
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:56,230
and uh,
so certainly it works for some people,

1311
01:05:56,231 --> 01:05:59,980
but there are a lot of factors that 
determine whether it's gonna work.

1312
01:05:59,981 --> 01:06:02,080
So one is,
is how well you do it.

1313
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:04,660
I'm too is you know,
whether you know,

1314
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:09,661
what you're dealing with supplementation
in terms of getting the necessary 

1315
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:10,000
nutrients.
Three is genetics.

1316
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:15,030
So let me,
there are genetic differences that 

1317
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:19,501
determine how well we convert precursor 
nutrients into the nutrients that we 

1318
01:06:19,501 --> 01:06:24,031
actually need.
And let me give three examples to make 

1319
01:06:24,031 --> 01:06:24,970
this more real.
So one is EPA and Dha.

1320
01:06:24,971 --> 01:06:28,390
These are these long chain Omega three 
fats that we've heard so much about that

1321
01:06:28,391 --> 01:06:31,120
are crucial for brain function,
cardiovascular function,

1322
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,040
etc.
And we primarily,

1323
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:37,390
you get them by eating fish.
There Are no sources of those in a plant

1324
01:06:37,391 --> 01:06:41,590
based diet except for algae.
Um,

1325
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,830
but an lg is not the bioavailable.

1326
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,280
Right?
And how many people do you know that eat

1327
01:06:46,281 --> 01:06:48,050
algae?
Not.

1328
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,630
I don't know.
You can,

1329
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:55,020
you can.
There's that famous green 

1330
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:55,020
supplementation stuff.
That's okay.

1331
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:56,470
You can use it as a supplement,
but very few people are eating it.

1332
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,910
So,
um,

1333
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:03,040
but,
but there is something called alpha 

1334
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:03,040
linolenic acid,
which is in walnuts and flax seed.

1335
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:07,681
That's an omega three plant fat and 
humans in theory can convert some of 

1336
01:07:07,871 --> 01:07:12,850
that plant based omega three into this 
long chain epa and dha that we need.

1337
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,500
But the thing,
here's the thing,

1338
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:19,420
only about five to 10 percent of that 
gets converted into epa and even less to

1339
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:21,070
dha,
like two to five percent.

1340
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:26,130
So you have to be chugging tablespoons 
of flax oil in order to get as much epa 

1341
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:29,980
or dha that you would get from eating 
just a little bit of fish.

1342
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:35,340
And that's if everything is going well 
because if you have deficiency of any 

1343
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:39,541
nutrients that are involved in the 
enzymatic conversion of those plant 

1344
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:42,010
based fats into the long chain fats,
then you won't make those conversions at

1345
01:07:42,011 --> 01:07:42,970
that optimal rate.

1346
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:47,970
IT'll be even less and ironically many 
of those nutrients and nutrients that 

1347
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:50,530
are not well represented in a vegan or 
vegetarian diet.

1348
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,070
So that's one example.
Another would be vitamin k two,

1349
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:55,070
which is a,
uh,

1350
01:07:55,370 --> 01:08:00,040
a different form of vitamin k that's 
recently been discovered and it's really

1351
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:02,140
important for cardiovascular and bone 
health.

1352
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:06,040
It basically puts,
make sure that calcium gets in our bones

1353
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:09,220
and our teeth and our heart tissues 
where it belongs and keeps it out of the

1354
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:14,221
soft tissues like our arteries,
where calcium would make our arteries 

1355
01:08:14,221 --> 01:08:14,770
heart and increase the risk of a heart 
attack.

1356
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,440
So I'm two is only really in animal 
foods with the exception of some 

1357
01:08:21,081 --> 01:08:26,081
fermented foods like natto,
which is a japanese fermented soybean 

1358
01:08:26,081 --> 01:08:28,540
product that most people cannot stand.
Um,

1359
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,080
it's,
it's a strong taste.

1360
01:08:30,081 --> 01:08:33,680
Not very many people are eating it here,
a kefir and,

1361
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,410
and sauerkraut and kimchi.

1362
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:36,560
You have k,
k,

1363
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,040
two in.
It could fear.

1364
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:43,050
I've been dot kiefer my whole life.
That's how I've never heard it sets how 

1365
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:46,670
they say it,
where firas from every other person I've

1366
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:48,440
ever met so says key.
So don't worry about it.

1367
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,710
Okay.
I'm saying kaffir from now,

1368
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:55,820
ari shaffir fear you'll be in the select
few that know how to feel good about it 

1369
01:08:57,231 --> 01:08:59,990
already.
So yes,

1370
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:04,991
you can feel superior now.
Can I stop you real quick just because 

1371
01:09:04,991 --> 01:09:08,630
we're gonna want to get a little bit 
onto this track of what you were 

1372
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:13,061
describing.
Fish oil conversion and the difference 

1373
01:09:13,061 --> 01:09:17,471
between flax seed oil.
What convenience take in order to sort 

1374
01:09:17,471 --> 01:09:22,061
of recommend that vegans take micro 
algae because it has preformed dha in 

1375
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:27,761
it.
So you bypass that whole conversion 

1376
01:09:27,761 --> 01:09:28,100
issue.
If they do take micro algae,

1377
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:32,030
is that sufficient or how much different
is that than eating fish?

1378
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:34,790
Well,
it's quite different because fish have a

1379
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:38,360
lot of other nutrients aside from epa 
and dha team,

1380
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,390
they have salinium.
Um,

1381
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,470
they have a lot of other bioavailable 
nutrients.

1382
01:09:42,471 --> 01:09:43,160
But,
but,

1383
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,180
and the other disadvantages,
you have to take a boatload of,

1384
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:51,270
of algae.
Boatload give me a call.

1385
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,830
I think so there are different products 
have different amounts.

1386
01:09:54,831 --> 01:09:56,210
But um,
you know,

1387
01:09:56,211 --> 01:10:01,211
I think you'd have to take six to nine 
caps capsules a day of the average algae

1388
01:10:02,451 --> 01:10:05,370
supplement in order to meet your dha.
That's not bad.

1389
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:09,200
No,
it's absolutely possible,

1390
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:12,680
but that would be a good way to be 
healthy with the vegan diet.

1391
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:17,681
That would be one way to address the 
shortcoming of know of lack of dha on 

1392
01:10:17,871 --> 01:10:20,120
the vegan diet.
There are other shortcomings,

1393
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:23,350
other nutrients like b 12,
which are shoe.

1394
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:27,140
That's a big issue and vegans need to be
supplementing with that.

1395
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:32,620
TheRe's a myth out there that there are 
some plant sources of b12 like seaweed 

1396
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:35,750
and in spirit like spirulina and 
nutritional yeast,

1397
01:10:35,751 --> 01:10:40,390
but those actually contain a kind of 
phony forms of b 12 that,

1398
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:44,540
that can block the absorption of true 
b12,

1399
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:47,930
which is only found in animal products 
or supplements.

1400
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:51,140
So a 12 supplement would be really 
important as well.

1401
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:54,560
It's the source of a b 12 supplement.
Um,

1402
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,750
they,
it's synthetic,

1403
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,420
it's synthetic I think,
but they just,

1404
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,910
there's three forms of be 12,
there's,

1405
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:05,480
there's hydroxocobalamin and 
methylcobalamin or,

1406
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:10,650
or four forms that you can supplement 
with cyanocobalamin and 

1407
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:13,100
adenosylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin is 
a synthetic form.

1408
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,290
And then the other ones are natural 
forms of b,

1409
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:20,291
12 that you would encounter in food.
So people can supplement with any of 

1410
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:21,450
those,
the natural forms,

1411
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:25,380
they're better to supplement with 
because they're more bioavailable.

1412
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:31,010
But definitely if a vegan,
I would recommend supplementing with b 

1413
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:32,790
12 because there aren't any sources of 
it in the diet.

1414
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:37,170
And studies have shown that 68 percent 
of vegetarians are deficient in b,

1415
01:11:37,171 --> 01:11:42,171
12.
80 three percent of vegans are versus 

1416
01:11:42,171 --> 01:11:42,171
just five percent of omnivores.
Wow.

1417
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,710
So it's a big difference.
We're not,

1418
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:46,050
you know,
and that's a factor in,

1419
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,250
in many different issues,
right?

1420
01:11:47,251 --> 01:11:49,770
It's A factor in the production of 
muscle,

1421
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:55,120
uh,
all production of all red blood cells 

1422
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,000
depends on [inaudible] and full eight.
And so I mean that's pretty fundamental,

1423
01:11:57,001 --> 01:12:02,001
right?
And then the myelin sheath requires be 

1424
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:02,001
12.
And this is why b,

1425
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:06,020
12 deficiency can mimic the signs of 
parkinson's or alzheimer's to these 

1426
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,110
people who are aging.
B,

1427
01:12:07,111 --> 01:12:11,650
12 deficiency happens in elderly people,
not because they're on a vegan diet beat

1428
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:16,690
because they have low stomach acid and 
they don't absorb the b12 as well as we 

1429
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:20,841
do when we're younger.
And so a lot of people who are elderly 

1430
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:22,230
who have symptoms of parkinson's or 
alzheimer's,

1431
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:27,560
they can sometimes be misdiagnosed with 
these conditions when they're actually 

1432
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:27,560
just be 12 deficient.

1433
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,060
So it's a series.
It's a real,

1434
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,600
really important nutrient.
Now,

1435
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:35,601
how can a vegans be assured that the 
[inaudible] that they're buying does not

1436
01:12:35,761 --> 01:12:38,510
have a animal products?
Uh,

1437
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:43,670
do,
do they have betweeN when you bind the 

1438
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:43,670
supplement fat typically it's usually 
safe.

1439
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:44,100
Yeah.
Uh,

1440
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,970
I'm not the best person to ask about 
that because I'm,

1441
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,490
I'm not a vegan myself.
I was a macrobiotic vegan at one point.

1442
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:51,900
What does that mean?
What's the difference?

1443
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:55,920
That's deep.
It's like a macrame.

1444
01:12:56,970 --> 01:13:01,970
Macrobiotics is a,
is a whole nother system of way of 

1445
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:01,970
looking at food.
It's a job,

1446
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:03,390
You know,
japanese,

1447
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:06,630
uh,
approach and um,

1448
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:11,750
you know,
the whole reason I came to do what I'm 

1449
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:11,750
doing now.
So I goT really,

1450
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:15,330
really sick in my twenties.
I almost died and I spent about 10 years

1451
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,690
just trying to get back to health.
And what did you pick from?

1452
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:22,200
I was in Indonesia.
I mentioned earlier,

1453
01:13:22,201 --> 01:13:27,201
I'd traveled around the world.
I was surfing and I got the classic 

1454
01:13:27,201 --> 01:13:28,770
tropical illness,
like immediate dysentery,

1455
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,800
giardia and blast assistance,
hominis so to parasites and an amoeba 

1456
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,260
and was just,
you know,

1457
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,500
coming out of both ends,
delirious,

1458
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:39,840
didn't remember really anything for 
three days.

1459
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:45,440
Um,
luckily there was one other australian 

1460
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,381
guy in the village that I was in who had
some antibiotics and this medical kit 

1461
01:13:48,381 --> 01:13:49,500
that kind of brought me back from the 
brink,

1462
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:55,070
but between the parasites and then the 
multiple rounds of antibiotics I had to 

1463
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:56,580
take to get rid of the parasites after 
that,

1464
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,320
it just wreaked havoc on my gut and it 
took me basically 10 years to recover.

1465
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:04,290
Oh yeah,
10 years.

1466
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:09,410
It was like the last decade when I was 
at 10 years because you approached it 

1467
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:11,980
incorrectly and you could do it now or 
was

1468
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,890
it just such a devastating round of 
disease?

1469
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:19,990
I think a little of both.
I mean I'm 42 now and I was 25 when this

1470
01:14:19,991 --> 01:14:24,991
first happened and we didn't know 
anything about the gut and the 

1471
01:14:24,991 --> 01:14:29,101
microbiome compared to what we know now.
Like there was very little awareness on 

1472
01:14:29,101 --> 01:14:29,740
that point.
Yeah.

1473
01:14:29,741 --> 01:14:31,290
Just in 15 years,
it's just,

1474
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:32,160
or 20 years,
it's,

1475
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,600
it's crazy.
So,

1476
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:37,280
you know,
I Took way more antibiotics than I would

1477
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:42,290
have done in retrospect because that's 
what the doctors were prescribing and 

1478
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:42,610
saying,
look,

1479
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:44,580
you've got these parasites,
we got to get rid of them.

1480
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:49,630
This is how you do it and you know,
and I think the antibiotics if could 

1481
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:54,200
have been like the treatment was 
probably worse than the disease for me 

1482
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:54,200
at that,
you know,

1483
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,960
after the number of courses of 
antibiotics that I took.

1484
01:14:56,830 --> 01:15:01,830
So along that path I tried to spell 
everY special diet you can possibly 

1485
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:06,220
imagine including becoming a vegetarian 
and a vegan and then a macrobiotic vegan

1486
01:15:06,221 --> 01:15:07,420
and raw food vegan.

1487
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:11,050
I've been there,
done that and I'm.

1488
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:13,900
so I'm completely sympathetic like to 
all.

1489
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:17,410
And I'm also a longtime meditater in 
buddhist.

1490
01:15:17,411 --> 01:15:20,080
So I understand the ethical argument 
very well.

1491
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:23,270
Many of my friends don't eat meat.
I'm sympathetic and I'm,

1492
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:25,260
I,
I care about the environment.

1493
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:28,330
I'm sympathetic to that argument.
I'm certainly not,

1494
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:34,560
you know,
I'm coming to this from a place of I 

1495
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:34,560
think a pretty balanced viewpoint.
Um,

1496
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:37,630
and uh,
the,

1497
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:44,100
the issues for me,
the reason why I eventually brought 

1498
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,120
animal products back into my diet was 
that I,

1499
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,880
I,
it became clear that I needed to do that

1500
01:15:48,881 --> 01:15:53,881
for my own health and I was able to 
reach a level of understanding and a 

1501
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:59,170
about the moral,
ethical and environmental choices that I

1502
01:15:59,171 --> 01:16:00,460
was making.
Um,

1503
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:01,870
that,
that I felt good about.

1504
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:08,640
Sam has brought up mollusks.
He was saying that one option that 

1505
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:13,141
vegans might want to consider is 
mollusks and that mollusks mollusks 

1506
01:16:13,141 --> 01:16:16,240
mollusks what a weird word,
clams,

1507
01:16:16,241 --> 01:16:21,241
mussels.
Things along those lines are so 

1508
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:23,251
primitive that the argument can be made 
that although they have movement where 

1509
01:16:23,251 --> 01:16:26,620
they open and close,
that they lacked pain sensors.

1510
01:16:26,621 --> 01:16:29,890
They lack,
like the fundamental things that make us

1511
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:34,891
distinguish the difference between 
animal and plant life and that people 

1512
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:39,100
might want to consider the consumption 
of mollusks same way they consider it.

1513
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:44,770
People eat mushrooms,
mushrooms which are in a vegan diet or 

1514
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:47,500
healthy or closer to an animal than they
are to a plant.

1515
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:52,501
They actually take in oxygen.
They breathe out carbon dioxide and 

1516
01:16:52,501 --> 01:16:57,060
fundamentally they reSemble living 
organisms that we consider like animals 

1517
01:16:57,521 --> 01:17:00,130
more than they consider plants more than
they resemble places.

1518
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:00,570
Really

1519
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:01,920
good point.
And it starts,

1520
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:06,270
the lines start to get blurry because we
know that some plants,

1521
01:17:06,271 --> 01:17:11,271
for example,
when they recognize that they're being 

1522
01:17:11,271 --> 01:17:13,191
eaten by a,
they secrete toxins to protect 

1523
01:17:13,191 --> 01:17:13,191
themselves,

1524
01:17:13,191 --> 01:17:15,510
not just recognize that they're being 
eaten,

1525
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:20,690
but they've played recordings of the 
caterpillar eating a plant next to a 

1526
01:17:20,821 --> 01:17:25,770
plant and it's changed the actual taste 
of the leaves to the point where animals

1527
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:29,550
find them disgusting and it causes some 
animals to starve to death.

1528
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:31,930
Not some level of awareness.
I mean,

1529
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:35,760
you may not call that intelligence or 
sanctions,

1530
01:17:35,761 --> 01:17:36,840
but it's some,
you know,

1531
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,320
what's the difference there between um,
a mollusk for example,

1532
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:42,260
who,
that like you described blAcks,

1533
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:47,270
pain sensors and you know,
what should we be prioritizing in that 

1534
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:51,741
situation if we are,
if we're using an ethical argument 

1535
01:17:51,741 --> 01:17:54,300
against eating meat,
there's even thornier issue,

1536
01:17:54,301 --> 01:17:59,301
which is there's no system of food 
production that does not involve the 

1537
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:01,080
death of animals,
it and.

1538
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:04,590
correct.
So if you think about monocropping big,

1539
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,120
you know tiller with blades going 
through these fields,

1540
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:11,250
you're killing vols,
you're killing rabbits,

1541
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:16,251
you're killing snakes,
you're killing all kinds of small 

1542
01:18:16,251 --> 01:18:19,730
animals and is the value of a small 
animal life less than the value of a 

1543
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:24,411
large animal life.
Some philosophers or people who look at 

1544
01:18:24,411 --> 01:18:28,371
this morally have actually argued that 
killing a larger before like a cow that 

1545
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:32,370
can feed many people is superior 
ethically or morally.

1546
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:37,600
Then you know a method of food 
production that kills many small animals

1547
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,890
in order to,
you know,

1548
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:41,930
and won't feed as many people can.
People treat density per.

1549
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:42,950
Don't like to look at that

1550
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:47,980
because it's inconvenient.
But I have friends that I have a good 

1551
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:50,861
buddy of mine who has a farm in Iowa and
he says when they run the combines over 

1552
01:18:50,861 --> 01:18:53,660
corn and grain and chopped down all the 
different things that they grow.

1553
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:57,890
You'll see vultures and crows and all 
these things circling the fields because

1554
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:00,950
there's all sorts of animals that get 
chewed up in that process.

1555
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:06,010
And in fact,
more animals get chewed up to create a 

1556
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:08,780
pound of grain.
Like more animals,

1557
01:19:08,781 --> 01:19:10,780
more more insects,
more,

1558
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,340
I mean when insects are animals by the 
way,

1559
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:18,930
there are a life form and more different
things get chewed up in creating that 

1560
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,180
then would be if you've got a pound of 
meat,

1561
01:19:23,181 --> 01:19:26,910
because as you said,
one cow could to consolidate.

1562
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:29,790
A lot of people consume it over the 
course of a year and

1563
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:34,790
the nutrient density is far superior to 
a pound of grains or even an equivalent 

1564
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:35,970
amount of weight

1565
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:37,760
grains,
which you don't hear that argument.

1566
01:19:37,761 --> 01:19:41,510
You hear the opposite argument where a 
cow consumes so much grass,

1567
01:19:41,511 --> 01:19:44,090
it needs so much land to graze and that 
argument,

1568
01:19:44,091 --> 01:19:45,890
unfortunately it's actually been 
distorted.

1569
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:50,450
I had some guys on from the documentary 
cowspiracy,

1570
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:53,480
which I don't think they were 
intentionally trying to deceive.

1571
01:19:53,481 --> 01:19:55,340
I think they're really good guys and 
they're making,

1572
01:19:55,620 --> 01:20:00,620
they're,
they think they're making a really good 

1573
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,591
point,
but when you talk to ranchers and you 

1574
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:04,100
get the actual number of how much 
acreage it takes to feed a cow,

1575
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:05,830
it's not as much as they thought it was.
No,

1576
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,860
we can talk about that too.
Um,

1577
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:09,260
the,
the,

1578
01:20:09,261 --> 01:20:14,261
the,
the interest to ethical argument is 

1579
01:20:14,261 --> 01:20:14,261
really interesting too for all of these 
reasons,

1580
01:20:14,261 --> 01:20:16,080
but then you think about the method of 
death,

1581
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:19,620
right?
So let's take like a,

1582
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:24,810
a humane slaughterhouse where there's a 
lot of care and consideration that goes 

1583
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:28,611
into how the animals last moments are 
and how they actually slaughter the 

1584
01:20:28,681 --> 01:20:33,681
animals so that it's painless and quick.
I can hear the vegans going crazy right 

1585
01:20:33,681 --> 01:20:33,900
now.
This is jumbo shrimp.

1586
01:20:33,901 --> 01:20:37,360
This is military intelligence is versus 
let's see this,

1587
01:20:37,361 --> 01:20:42,361
this combine that goes through the field
decapitates the mother vole and her 

1588
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:47,810
babies in the nest die of starvation 
because their mother is not able to 

1589
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,080
provide food for them.
That's a,

1590
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:52,980
that's a arguably worse way for an 
animal to die.

1591
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,160
Right?
Or even any of your rancher friends know

1592
01:20:56,161 --> 01:20:57,450
what it's like,
you know,

1593
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,450
they found one of their animals that's 
been killed by a predator.

1594
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:05,870
And if you go on youtube and watch how 
like a hyena kill an animal to animal 

1595
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:07,600
will still be alive while it's getting 
disemboweled yeah,

1596
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:09,670
that's not a very nice way to die.
Right?

1597
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:12,360
And that's what wolves will do.
And that's what I mean,

1598
01:21:12,361 --> 01:21:13,950
that's a,
that's a giant issue.

1599
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:19,250
The difference between the way a 
predator kill something in the way a 

1600
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:19,250
person does,
but on the other hand,

1601
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:22,560
of course it's impossible to deny the 
real issues with factory farming and the

1602
01:21:22,561 --> 01:21:26,180
inhumane methods that are so common when
you're buying these chicken nuggets.

1603
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:31,340
I guarantee you these are not ethically 
sourced ethically and humanely raised 

1604
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:35,871
chickens.
They're just not and know when you're 

1605
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:37,050
driving on the highway and you see those
trucks that are stuffed full of chickens

1606
01:21:37,051 --> 01:21:42,051
and the chickens literally the little 
faces or poking out of the side of the 

1607
01:21:42,051 --> 01:21:42,051
truck that,
that,

1608
01:21:42,051 --> 01:21:44,850
that is in my opinion,
a bigger issue.

1609
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:46,410
Absolutely.
And this is,

1610
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,910
I mean,
interestingly enough,

1611
01:21:47,911 --> 01:21:52,911
this is something where I think I have 
more in common with vegans than I do 

1612
01:21:52,911 --> 01:21:56,310
with like the average person is we both 
care about how food is produced.

1613
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:58,560
We care about,
you know,

1614
01:21:58,561 --> 01:22:01,920
I don't eat factory farmed meat.
I don't eat factory farmed vegetables.

1615
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,090
You know,
like I,

1616
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:07,770
I try to eat meat that's from local,
from local farmer.

1617
01:22:07,771 --> 01:22:10,080
I'm lucky that where I live,
that that's accessible.

1618
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:13,380
Um,
I buy produce from the farmers market,

1619
01:22:13,381 --> 01:22:16,290
we grow a lot of produce in our 
backyard.

1620
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:21,730
Um,
it's this whole food system that needs 

1621
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:24,561
to change both in terms of conventional 
agriculture and the monocropping of 

1622
01:22:24,561 --> 01:22:24,990
wheat and corn and,
and,

1623
01:22:24,991 --> 01:22:28,920
and these kinds of and soybeans and 
plant foods,

1624
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:31,440
but also the,
you know,

1625
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:34,080
mass production,
conventional,

1626
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:39,200
um,
a animal operations need to change as 

1627
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,980
well.
So I'm not arguing for that.

1628
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:45,060
And I think that's absolutely a losing 
argument,

1629
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:50,800
but there is a lot of land that two 
thirds of the surface land in this in 

1630
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,680
the world is not suitable for crop 
production and we,

1631
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:56,360
but it is suitable for raising animals.
And,

1632
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,700
and if those animals are raised in a 
sustainable way,

1633
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:00,930
um,
it,

1634
01:23:00,931 --> 01:23:03,360
I think it is possible to feed the world
with,

1635
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:08,630
you know,
maybe not the amount of animal products 

1636
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:09,070
that the average american is eating now.
But,

1637
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:14,800
uh,
we can utilize the available land in a 

1638
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,540
much smarter way to produce nutrient 
dense foods.

1639
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,260
And we just,
you know,

1640
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,330
we need to consider the whole cycle.
Like we,

1641
01:23:20,331 --> 01:23:23,920
we like to remove ourselves from the 
cycle of life and from nature.

1642
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:26,740
We're not animals,
we're humans or separate from it.

1643
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:30,550
But when you consider that whole cycle 
and when you consider like the soil,

1644
01:23:30,551 --> 01:23:35,551
for example,
if you think you think of it as a bank 

1645
01:23:35,551 --> 01:23:35,551
account,
when you plant crops,

1646
01:23:35,551 --> 01:23:40,350
you're withdrawing from that bank 
account and if you want the soil to be 

1647
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:41,800
healthy and continue to be able to 
support life,

1648
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:43,030
you need to put input.

1649
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,370
You need To make a deposit back in that 
bank account.

1650
01:23:45,371 --> 01:23:48,100
And the way we've been doing that in 
conventional agriculture is with,

1651
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:52,270
is with chemicals and thOse chemical 
fertilizers,

1652
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:54,670
they do kind of make a deposit in some 
way,

1653
01:23:54,671 --> 01:23:59,671
but they also make it less the soil,
less able to sequester carbon.

1654
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:05,101
They cause all kinds of problems with 
runoff and gi toxicity and water and 

1655
01:24:05,101 --> 01:24:07,220
local watershed systems.
Um,

1656
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:12,330
and any organic farmer will tell you 
that the best way to add those inputs 

1657
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:15,190
back in is the poop of animals along 
with their blood and their bone.

1658
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:20,170
And so that's that cycle of life where 
the animal inputs go into the soil.

1659
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:22,010
Those inputs,
you know,

1660
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:25,000
the urine adds water to the soil,
the poop ads,

1661
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:30,090
microorganisms that help the soil 
sequester carbon so that studies have 

1662
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:34,771
shown that pasture raised animals are 
either net neutral in terms of carbon 

1663
01:24:34,930 --> 01:24:38,140
out put her,
they actually even help sequester carbon

1664
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:43,380
so you could even argue that raising 
animals and eating animals is necessary 

1665
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,760
for the benefit of our soils and our 
ecosystems in general yet,

1666
01:24:47,761 --> 01:24:50,200
so if someone has has a,
a large,

1667
01:24:50,201 --> 01:24:53,770
you know,
20 acre plot of land and the using it to

1668
01:24:53,771 --> 01:24:57,880
grow alfalfa or something that people 
eat or soybeans or something along those

1669
01:24:57,881 --> 01:24:58,210
lines.

1670
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:03,690
If they're not in some way contributing 
some sort of animal product to that 

1671
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:09,541
soil,
the soil is going to become 

1672
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:11,761
nutritionally deficient and then the 
people who eat the plants that come out 

1673
01:25:11,761 --> 01:25:14,260
of that soil are going to get 
nutritionally deficient.

1674
01:25:14,261 --> 01:25:19,261
Plants minerally deficient in particular
that it's a giant issue with the United 

1675
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:21,760
States farmlands.
There's a booklet.

1676
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:26,780
It's received a lot of criticism,
but it brings up some interesting 

1677
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:26,780
points.
It's called dead doctors don't lie.

1678
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:31,640
It's this guy dr joel wallach and a lot 
of is the things that he said have been 

1679
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:36,570
rightly criticized,
but what's interesting about what he's 

1680
01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:39,691
saying is when he's talking about 
minerally deficient plants and soil and 

1681
01:25:39,691 --> 01:25:41,520
that the United States is known,
you know,

1682
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:45,760
when they've done studies on farm lands 
in the 19 thirties and forties,

1683
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:48,970
that there was an issue with mineral 
deficiency and so,

1684
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:54,270
um,
that's where they started adding 

1685
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:54,610
nitrogen and from,
from the hopper method,

1686
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:55,120
you know,
in,

1687
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,880
into soil and it helps and you can grow 
crops,

1688
01:25:57,881 --> 01:26:02,881
but the difference between the food that
you're getting that is grown with 

1689
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:08,650
chemical fertilizers that address sOme 
of the issues that you're talking abouT 

1690
01:26:08,650 --> 01:26:12,821
versus the traditional method of compost
and manure and animal products.

1691
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:18,080
Like you're getting away healthier plant
and when you're consuming it,

1692
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:20,570
you're getting a far more nutrient dense
plant.

1693
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:25,630
Right?
Not to mention the environmental 

1694
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:25,780
implications of chemical fertilizers.
Pesticides,

1695
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:30,850
I know dial got bone cancer because he 
grew up next to a golf course and the 

1696
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:36,940
pesticides and all the shit that they 
would pump onto thE golf course to keeP 

1697
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:40,301
the weeds from growing.
Got into the well system And a bunch of 

1698
01:26:40,301 --> 01:26:41,960
people in this community like a huge 
amount got cancer,

1699
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:46,990
right.
I want to go back to something you were 

1700
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:46,990
saying about,
you know,

1701
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:50,210
vegans and vegetarians anD how to kind 
of optimize if you're doing that diet.

1702
01:26:50,211 --> 01:26:51,360
So,
um,

1703
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:56,680
two things that I wanted to address.
One was you asked about mollusks and 

1704
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:00,351
that I've actually argued that a 
vegetarian diet with shellfish and organ

1705
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:05,531
meats would be better than a paleo diet 
with no shellfish and organ meats.

1706
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:11,170
Interesting.
And that's Because what we talked about 

1707
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:11,170
earlier,
muscle meats,

1708
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:15,700
organ meats and shellfish are the two 
most nutrient dense classes of foods.

1709
01:27:15,801 --> 01:27:20,801
Like I,
I've just been finishing the curriculum 

1710
01:27:20,801 --> 01:27:24,431
for my clinician training program where 
I'm going through systematically every 

1711
01:27:24,981 --> 01:27:29,540
nutrient and I'm looking at in nutrition
data what the most,

1712
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:31,910
the highest food sources for those 
nutrients are.

1713
01:27:31,911 --> 01:27:36,911
And again,
I wish I had the thing to just lay it 

1714
01:27:36,911 --> 01:27:36,911
out and show you.
But you know,

1715
01:27:36,911 --> 01:27:39,950
in almost every case it's an organ meat 
or a shellfish.

1716
01:27:39,951 --> 01:27:44,951
that's the highest source of that.
Whether you're talking about 12 or iron 

1717
01:27:44,951 --> 01:27:47,810
or copper or zinc or full eight,
it's always beef,

1718
01:27:47,811 --> 01:27:48,590
liver,
chicken,

1719
01:27:48,591 --> 01:27:49,820
liver,
clams,

1720
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:51,260
oysters,
et cetera.

1721
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:56,680
And so if someone was a veggie 
vegetarian who was willing to fudge a 

1722
01:27:56,721 --> 01:27:59,480
little bit and eat organ meats and 
shellfish,

1723
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:04,750
I think that would be a healthier 
approach than someone who's just eating 

1724
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:04,750
lean muscle.

1725
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:04,960
Neat.
Um,

1726
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:07,730
organs get tossed out a lot.
It's a really.

1727
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:13,120
It's a real problem in the hunting world
where when people got an animal,

1728
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:18,580
they leave the gut pile and there's even
a gutless method that a lot of people 

1729
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:18,580
use when they,
uh,

1730
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:22,160
they take on a big game animal,
like an elk or something like that.

1731
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:23,960
They just,
they leave it behind.

1732
01:28:23,961 --> 01:28:25,430
They leave the heart,
they leave the liver.

1733
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:30,850
But I saw this documentary on wolves and
was really fascinating was one of the 

1734
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:32,000
ways that they distinguish who the alpha
is.

1735
01:28:32,001 --> 01:28:37,001
In the wolf pack is the alpha wolf is 
the one who eats the liver the liver 

1736
01:28:37,001 --> 01:28:41,260
faster.
There are other animals that that's 

1737
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:42,971
true.
And I think that was true in hunter 

1738
01:28:42,971 --> 01:28:43,250
gather societies as well.
And someone was trying to say to me,

1739
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:45,230
well,
we'll livers process toxins,

1740
01:28:45,231 --> 01:28:46,850
don't you think they'd be filled with 
toxins?

1741
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,640
That's a common misconception.
The liver processes then,

1742
01:28:49,641 --> 01:28:51,350
but the,
the fat stores them.

1743
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:55,130
So if you're concerned about toxins in 
food,

1744
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,190
you should make sure that you're eating,
you know,

1745
01:28:57,410 --> 01:29:02,410
pasture raised,
organic fats like butter and cream and 

1746
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:02,410
thing.
If you dairy products,

1747
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:03,780
animal fats,
grass fed,

1748
01:29:03,781 --> 01:29:08,781
grass fed butter,
if you eat lard or tallow or anything 

1749
01:29:08,781 --> 01:29:13,191
like that,
it should come from pasture raised 

1750
01:29:13,191 --> 01:29:13,191
animals because the fat is where toxins 
are stored.

1751
01:29:13,191 --> 01:29:14,260
The liver processes.
then,

1752
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:16,050
um,
so when you,

1753
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:21,080
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but so when you're eating anything that 

1754
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:21,330
comes from an animal that's been fed 
grain,

1755
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:26,570
you're dealing with an animal that has 
the same sort of inflammation issuEs 

1756
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:31,131
that a Person hAs from processing things
that it's not naturally supposed to 

1757
01:29:31,131 --> 01:29:34,911
process.
Like pat processed wheat and the 

1758
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:38,160
bleached flour and things besides 
antibiotic residue.

1759
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:43,670
Yeah.
So when you're taking in those animal 

1760
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:46,881
products that we traditionally do,
whether it's butter or milk or dairy or 

1761
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:51,021
cheese or things along those lines,
when you're taking those from an animal 

1762
01:29:51,021 --> 01:29:52,200
that's eating grain,
you're actually getting the fats.

1763
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:53,290
So your,
your,

1764
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:56,520
it's less healthy than actually eating 
the liver of that animal.

1765
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:57,570
Yeah,
I would.

1766
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:02,990
It may be.
I mean the liver is more nutrient dense 

1767
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:02,990
anyways.
But um,

1768
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:08,390
pasture raised animal fats a have a lot 
more nutrients than conventionally 

1769
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:13,311
raiseD fats because the animals are 
eating grass and grasses way more 

1770
01:30:13,311 --> 01:30:14,540
nutrient dense than the grains that,
you know,

1771
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:16,500
conventional animals are fed.
Also,

1772
01:30:16,501 --> 01:30:19,020
the omega threes and sixes are 
different.

1773
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:24,420
The ratio a mega six is the same,
but omega three is three or four times 

1774
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:28,050
higher in pasture raised animals.
Why does it make it six percent?

1775
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,850
It's a good question.
It's,

1776
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,000
it used to be the kind of a consensus 
was that omega sixes would be higher in 

1777
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:41,300
omega threes will be lower,
but it actually looks like omega six is 

1778
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:44,040
constant and omega three is higher.
The omega three is higher because of the

1779
01:30:44,041 --> 01:30:46,650
grass probably has more alpha linolenic 
acid,

1780
01:30:46,651 --> 01:30:48,400
which is the plant based form,
uh,

1781
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:48,780
that day.

1782
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:51,120
Then animal does the conversion.
I mean,

1783
01:30:51,121 --> 01:30:52,730
that's the thing that's really 
interesting to,

1784
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:57,890
to consider here too is humans are 
really inefficient at making these 

1785
01:30:57,890 --> 01:31:00,630
conversions of these less active 
nutrients to the more active ones.

1786
01:31:00,631 --> 01:31:03,090
We started talk about it with epa and 
dha,

1787
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:04,470
k,
k,

1788
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:09,530
vitamin k,
one is what's converted into k two cows 

1789
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:10,770
are experts at doing that.
They're really good at it.

1790
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,870
HumanS not so much.
So when we eat the animal,

1791
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:15,750
the animals basically done the work for 
us.

1792
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:20,810
We get the preformed final nutrient that
we need rather than having to do those 

1793
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:25,761
steps ourselves and starting to rub is,
is this a function of the adaptation of 

1794
01:31:25,801 --> 01:31:27,870
people developing while eating these 
animals?

1795
01:31:27,871 --> 01:31:29,070
I think so,
yeah.

1796
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:34,150
A beta carotenes another example that's 
a precursor to active vitamin a or 

1797
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:37,440
retinol and beta carotenes have some 
benefits in our bodies,

1798
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:39,300
but retinols is the real thing.

1799
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:40,920
You know,
what we need more than anything.

1800
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:45,980
And uh,
that conversion is as low as three to 

1801
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:46,380
five percent.
And some people on facts there,

1802
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:51,390
there are some who don't make the 
conversion at all and those are the 

1803
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:52,260
people who turn orange after a carrot 
juice fast,

1804
01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:54,900
ever see me when I'm with like the 
orange palms.

1805
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:59,920
but it happens.
My friend andy used to drink so much 

1806
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:03,540
characteristic the inside of his hands 
and his skin would turn orange so he 

1807
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:07,441
probably wasn't good at converting beta 
carotene into retinol because we should 

1808
01:32:07,441 --> 01:32:09,160
be able to do that.
But some people can't but isn't just the

1809
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:12,340
mass quantities.
I mean it could be that too,

1810
01:32:12,341 --> 01:32:17,341
but I'm a retinol is only really present
in organ meats and pasture raised fats.

1811
01:32:19,811 --> 01:32:21,750
It's not even really in muscle meats 
like,

1812
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:24,130
you know,
lean ground beef or chicken breast,

1813
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:29,340
boneless chicken breast or um,
so in order to get retinol we need to 

1814
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:30,010
consume these pasture raise.

1815
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:32,320
Fats are where we need to consume organ 
meats.

1816
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:33,950
And as you pointed out,
we're going to be.

1817
01:32:33,951 --> 01:32:36,580
It's really fallen out of favor in the 
us.

1818
01:32:36,581 --> 01:32:41,581
And this is only recent,
like I bet you our grandparents ate a 

1819
01:32:41,581 --> 01:32:44,500
lot more organ meats than we eat still 
in some parts of the world.

1820
01:32:44,501 --> 01:32:49,501
They still eat organ meats more try.
We do liver and onions are very famous 

1821
01:32:49,501 --> 01:32:50,210
dish.
Yeah.

1822
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,430
Yeah.
It's hard.

1823
01:32:51,431 --> 01:32:55,840
And so you'll see like within the paleo,
primal kind of world,

1824
01:32:55,841 --> 01:33:00,841
the organ meats are making a comeback 
because we understand now with the 

1825
01:33:00,841 --> 01:33:04,471
nutrient density of these foods is and 
there's less now even in the mainstream 

1826
01:33:04,471 --> 01:33:09,091
world,
there's less of a solid argument that 

1827
01:33:09,091 --> 01:33:11,821
can be made about these having 
cholesterol or high levels of saturated 

1828
01:33:11,821 --> 01:33:16,471
fat.
It would prevent us from meeting them 

1829
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:18,360
now,
will it be the difference in terms of 

1830
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,420
the nutritional density of mollusks 
versus organ meat?

1831
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:22,510
So like if you were trying,
if you had a vegetarian or a vegan who's

1832
01:33:22,511 --> 01:33:27,511
on the fence and you know,
you made these arguments that are very 

1833
01:33:27,511 --> 01:33:27,890
rational and logical and you said it,
look,

1834
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:32,770
mollusks are essentially a very,
very primitive form of life that doesn't

1835
01:33:32,771 --> 01:33:37,771
feel pain.
And you could argue that there's more 

1836
01:33:37,771 --> 01:33:40,630
evidence that some plants feel pain and 
plants also have some very intense level

1837
01:33:40,631 --> 01:33:44,020
of communication where there,
there's a really interesting,

1838
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:45,070
uh,
uh,

1839
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:50,180
addition of radio lab recently where 
they went into this were they sort of 

1840
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:51,910
are trying to understand the difference 
between,

1841
01:33:52,190 --> 01:33:53,290
uh,
the,

1842
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,440
not the difference rather,
but the,

1843
01:33:55,441 --> 01:34:00,441
the complicated relationship between 
these different plants and the mycelium 

1844
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:07,380
in the soil and all of the different 
fungus in the soil that also acts as 

1845
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:10,090
sort of a transportation method.
The various nutrients and minerals.

1846
01:34:10,091 --> 01:34:15,091
And they're actually pulling these 
minerals out of the rock and they're 

1847
01:34:15,091 --> 01:34:15,640
getting sugars from the plants and 
they're exchanging them for minerals.

1848
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:20,850
And that there's this really complex 
interaction that we have sort of just 

1849
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:22,030
looked at and said,
oh,

1850
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:23,390
there's dirt.
There's plants in it.

1851
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:26,770
But there's a lot going on between these
various life forms.

1852
01:34:26,771 --> 01:34:31,771
And one of them being fungus,
which again is closEr to an animal than 

1853
01:34:31,771 --> 01:34:36,701
it is to a PlAnt,
but is imperative for the life of these 

1854
01:34:36,701 --> 01:34:39,901
plants.
AnD then somehow know that there were 

1855
01:34:39,901 --> 01:34:42,021
actually even sharing resources where if
they find or they're allotting resources

1856
01:34:42,731 --> 01:34:47,731
to certain plants that are more 
deficient or they're trying to channel 

1857
01:34:47,731 --> 01:34:50,431
resources to them.
So there's some form of communication 

1858
01:34:50,431 --> 01:34:50,431
and exchange here.
Yeah,

1859
01:34:50,431 --> 01:34:51,370
that's,
that's intelligence,

1860
01:34:51,371 --> 01:34:52,110
right?
I mean,

1861
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:56,830
paul stamets has done amazing work on 
this youngest in.

1862
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:03,160
Yeah,
I would say that that's a really good 

1863
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:03,160
option.
I mean,

1864
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:06,970
when you look at nutrients like specific
nutrients that it goes back and forth 

1865
01:35:06,970 --> 01:35:07,280
between liver and,
you know,

1866
01:35:07,281 --> 01:35:09,740
organ meats and shellfish and some,
some nutrients.

1867
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:14,970
A organ meats are higher like vitamin a 
or iron and other nutrients.

1868
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:19,100
Shellfish are generally higher like with
zinc or copper.

1869
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:21,500
Um,
but certainly even,

1870
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:26,650
even a shellfish are higher in almost 
all of the key nutrients that we need.

1871
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:32,510
Then a lot of the plant based food 
alternatives that they would be choosing

1872
01:35:32,511 --> 01:35:37,511
from.
And so if it's a vegan was willing to 

1873
01:35:37,511 --> 01:35:37,670
eat molluscs I would say that that would
be a great idea.

1874
01:35:37,671 --> 01:35:38,030
And,
and,

1875
01:35:38,031 --> 01:35:43,031
uh,
the benefit there is you don't need to 

1876
01:35:43,031 --> 01:35:43,031
eat a lot,
like three ounces,

1877
01:35:43,031 --> 01:35:47,210
a single serving a can meet your copper 
requirement for the entire week.

1878
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:49,000
Oh wow.
just one time.

1879
01:35:49,930 --> 01:35:52,880
Waste oysters and I've history and same 
with iron.

1880
01:35:52,881 --> 01:35:54,530
I think if I'm going off the top of my 
head,

1881
01:35:54,531 --> 01:35:59,531
I'll iron and zinc.
It can nearly meet your entire weekly 

1882
01:35:59,531 --> 01:36:03,190
requirement.
So it's not like you have to eat a ton 

1883
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:03,190
of these things.
You,

1884
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:06,331
you know,
you have a serving of clams once a week 

1885
01:36:06,331 --> 01:36:06,331
and you have a serving of oysters once a
week,

1886
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:07,860
uh,
you know,

1887
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:09,300
on top of the,
uh,

1888
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:11,840
getting as much nutrient density as you 
can,

1889
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:14,510
that should do,
that'll be 12.

1890
01:36:14,511 --> 01:36:16,940
That's iron that sink.
That's copper,

1891
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:20,360
epa and dha.
The launching of omega three fats are in

1892
01:36:20,361 --> 01:36:21,150
these,
uh,

1893
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:24,030
in these mollusks because as well,
uh,

1894
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:27,380
and they're typically low on the 
toxicity,

1895
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,270
a scale to.
They're not,

1896
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:31,190
they don't tend to hAve a lot of 
mercury.

1897
01:36:31,191 --> 01:36:36,191
They don't bio accumulate a lot of 
toxins compared to some other predator 

1898
01:36:36,191 --> 01:36:40,630
species of fish that are higher in the 
food chain that accumulated a lot of 

1899
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:40,630
toxins.

1900
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:44,330
Is there any benefit to eating them 
cooked versus raw one way or the other?

1901
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,620
Well,
you know,

1902
01:36:45,621 --> 01:36:49,220
there's all,
there is the chance of disease in eating

1903
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:51,200
raw oysters.
Um,

1904
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:54,350
I think it's pretty minimal compared to 
some other risks,

1905
01:36:54,351 --> 01:36:56,900
but it is there and cooking,
you know,

1906
01:36:56,901 --> 01:37:01,670
mitigates that.
So definitely I think in general cooking

1907
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:06,730
makes the nutrients in meat and animal 
products more bioavailable rather than 

1908
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:06,960
less.
Uh,

1909
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:09,440
and that's in vegetables.
It's,

1910
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:13,310
it depends on the vegetable and the um,
and the method of cooking.

1911
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:14,290
But a,
it,

1912
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,800
it's a mix.
It's more of a mixed bag,

1913
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:19,520
but with me to generally improve the 
bioavailability.

1914
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:24,730
So it really is in a lot of ways an 
ideological issue where it's sort of 

1915
01:37:25,221 --> 01:37:27,200
framed that,
you know,

1916
01:37:27,201 --> 01:37:28,940
you don't want to contribute to 
suffering,

1917
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:32,570
but these things really don't suffer 
there.

1918
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,770
Yeah.
But even there,

1919
01:37:33,771 --> 01:37:35,060
you know,
as we talked about,

1920
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:37,370
you're going to control,
you're gonna contribute to suffering and

1921
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:40,880
potentially more if you're looking on 
the scale of individual lives,

1922
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:43,340
and it might sound like this is 
nitpicky,

1923
01:37:43,341 --> 01:37:46,040
but it's not.
we're talking about actual lives,

1924
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:46,790
you know,
and,

1925
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:51,791
and then you have to start evaluating 
like is a cow more attention or worth 

1926
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:56,010
the life of the cow worth more than the 
life of a rabbit or a

1927
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,620
fall or the kind of animals that are 
being killed.

1928
01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:02,700
And you know,
in the production of these plant foods,

1929
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,680
um,
it's a real question.

1930
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:07,980
And then you have insecticides and you 
have,

1931
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,000
you know,
the amount of insects that get her 

1932
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:13,000
killed.
Killed.

1933
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:13,560
yeah.
When you're processing crops,

1934
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:18,950
there's just no getting around.
If you're buying anything that is from 

1935
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:23,511
large scale agriculture,
you were involved in the death of some 

1936
01:38:23,511 --> 01:38:25,320
sort of animals or insects.
And I know the argument is like,

1937
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:27,930
there's an argument about intentionality
and whether,

1938
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:28,720
you know,
if,

1939
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:32,850
if,
if I intended to kill this animal to eat

1940
01:38:32,851 --> 01:38:35,430
it,
it's different than if you didn't intend

1941
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:37,080
to eat it.
To me that's,

1942
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:39,210
I'm not so sure about that.
Yeah,

1943
01:38:39,570 --> 01:38:43,260
because it's,
it's almost like willful ignorance that,

1944
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,160
that,
um,

1945
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:49,220
that these animals are being killed in 
the production of these plants that I'm 

1946
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:49,220
eating.

1947
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:50,020
I mean,
I see the argument,

1948
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:53,760
but I'm not sure I buy it.
I do as well.

1949
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:58,761
And I see the willful ignorance argument
up until the point where it gets 

1950
01:38:58,761 --> 01:39:01,821
explained to you.
So as soon as someone explained to you 

1951
01:39:01,821 --> 01:39:04,191
like you've just done about the combines
and how they're chewing up all these 

1952
01:39:04,191 --> 01:39:04,191
animals.
And by the way fonz too,

1953
01:39:04,191 --> 01:39:08,811
it's a huge issue with deers because if 
you've ever seen a baby deer out in the 

1954
01:39:08,811 --> 01:39:09,600
wild,
there's one of the weirdest things about

1955
01:39:09,601 --> 01:39:10,740
them.
When they're very young,

1956
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:14,280
they do not move.
So in the face of danger,

1957
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:19,281
they have this instinct freeze so you 
can literally go up to a fawn and 

1958
01:39:19,281 --> 01:39:23,511
they'll,
they'll be tucked up on the ground and 

1959
01:39:23,511 --> 01:39:23,511
they're healthy,
completely healthy.

1960
01:39:23,511 --> 01:39:24,570
And you could walk right next to the 
font and the headlights.

1961
01:39:24,630 --> 01:39:29,630
Yeah.
You could stomp on the ground next to 

1962
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:29,630
them.
They don't move.

1963
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:29,940
They sit around and wait for their 
mother to retail.

1964
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:32,820
It's really interesting.
They get chewed up by combines.

1965
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:37,850
It's really.
I mean because these animals bed in 

1966
01:39:37,850 --> 01:39:38,340
these fields all the time and if 
something happens to the mother,

1967
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:43,610
especially if she gets attacked by a 
coyote or something along those lines 

1968
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:44,190
and then the babies just get chewed up 
by the,

1969
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:46,130
by the combines.
There's,

1970
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:51,860
yeah.
There's another interesting question 

1971
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:53,490
here too,
which is more around like privilege and 

1972
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:58,530
again like whether we see ourselves as 
part of the ecosystem and the food cycle

1973
01:39:58,531 --> 01:40:02,160
or as separate from it.
Did you think about like native american

1974
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:07,660
or traditional hunter gather or even 
contemporary people living in let's say 

1975
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:10,830
in Afghanistan and all they can they 
have is a goat,

1976
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:12,900
you know,
and they.

1977
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:17,160
Or a poor family in India who has access
to a backyard cow,

1978
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:19,590
should they not eat,
you know,

1979
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:24,680
milk and butter and those animal foods 
because of moral or ethical argument 

1980
01:40:25,441 --> 01:40:30,441
against that,
or it seems like an argument coming from

1981
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:33,990
a tremendous place of privilege for,
for us to,

1982
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:39,250
to say that the choices that they make 
are somehow wrong or immoral because 

1983
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:42,780
they,
you know,

1984
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:46,230
we can afford to make these different 
choices in defense of vegans.

1985
01:40:46,230 --> 01:40:47,960
I never hear that argument honestly.
I see.

1986
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:52,440
I think I hear the argument that in 
America today you have the choice and in

1987
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:54,370
westernized you have the choice

1988
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:58,000
and so that you can choose to contribute
less to suffering,

1989
01:40:58,150 --> 01:41:00,880
which I think ideologically makes a lot 
of sense.

1990
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:06,510
The problem is when you deal with the 
reality of it that you've sort of 

1991
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:08,170
described about large scale agriculture,
you're not.

1992
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:12,490
It means you're not immune to the 
suffering of animals in the death.

1993
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:13,990
It's just,
it's just not the case.

1994
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:17,340
Especially when you talk about insects.
I mean it's just,

1995
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:19,960
there's no way.
It's just an insects,

1996
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:21,730
at least.
I mean,

1997
01:41:21,731 --> 01:41:26,170
in my mind are more complex and more 
complicated than mollusks.

1998
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,040
Yeah,
I mean certainly the,

1999
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:33,150
if you look at some of the studies on an
insect behavior,

2000
01:41:33,151 --> 01:41:35,430
that's,
I think that would be born out.

2001
01:41:35,490 --> 01:41:37,300
Yeah.
But we have these like weird hierarchy,

2002
01:41:37,330 --> 01:41:39,540
so we love bees.
Bees are super important.

2003
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:45,090
These are another species that gets 
totally decimated by factory farming.

2004
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,640
Pesticides.
Pesticides are really,

2005
01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:50,100
really harmful for the bees.
Um,

2006
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:51,990
yeah.
I mean I agree with you.

2007
01:41:51,991 --> 01:41:55,200
I think there is,
you can say we have this because we have

2008
01:41:55,201 --> 01:41:57,480
that privilege.
We have the imperative not to cause more

2009
01:41:57,481 --> 01:41:59,730
suffering,
but I think what I get out of looking at

2010
01:41:59,731 --> 01:42:04,731
those cultures is it's more clear to me 
how intertwined with with nature and the

2011
01:42:06,091 --> 01:42:09,570
natural food systems that humans are in 
those circumstances,

2012
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:13,950
they're less removed from the basic 
cycle of life and it,

2013
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:15,960
it seems natural.
And when you,

2014
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:20,040
you know,
for the mussai pastoralist people to,

2015
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:25,180
to,
to drink the blood of the cows and eat 

2016
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,940
and drink the milk and eat the meat 
because that's inexorably intertwined to

2017
01:42:26,941 --> 01:42:28,590
their culture and their way of life.

2018
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:32,640
So that's why they survived.
Absolutely.

2019
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:33,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

2020
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:34,500
So,
uh,

2021
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:36,990
you know,
I think this is a really nuanced,

2022
01:42:36,991 --> 01:42:41,991
complex topic and there's a lot more to 
it than is typically shows up in the 

2023
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:48,540
internet debates of that.
Just go back and forth.

2024
01:42:48,541 --> 01:42:53,541
But at the end of the day,
from what I've seen as a clinician 

2025
01:42:53,541 --> 01:42:54,600
working with a lot of patients,
a lot of ex vegans,

2026
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:59,601
a lot of ex vegetarians,
is that some people can pull it off for 

2027
01:43:00,271 --> 01:43:05,271
a relatively long period of time and I 
think this is because they have the 

2028
01:43:05,271 --> 01:43:08,841
genes and the preexisting nutrient 
status and allows them to make those 

2029
01:43:08,841 --> 01:43:11,460
conversions of a less active nutrients 
to the more active forms.

2030
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:16,500
I'm better than the average person.
Then you see someone who goes on a vegan

2031
01:43:16,501 --> 01:43:21,501
diet and falls apart within a couple of 
months and this is the person who does 

2032
01:43:21,501 --> 01:43:23,310
not have the genes to make the,
you know,

2033
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:28,360
they're poor converter and they also 
probably had preexisting nutrient 

2034
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:30,750
deficiencies which made them less able 
to make those conversions.

2035
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:33,810
and so this kind of solves the question 
of,

2036
01:43:34,110 --> 01:43:36,060
or addresses the question you hear some 
people say,

2037
01:43:36,061 --> 01:43:37,100
well,
why does that person,

2038
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:39,570
that person does a vegan diet?
And he's pretty healthy,

2039
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,190
you know,
like you're rich roll.

2040
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:43,680
Um,
so it can't be,

2041
01:43:44,130 --> 01:43:45,130
can't be problematic.
Well,

2042
01:43:45,131 --> 01:43:47,160
look,
we don't all respond the same way to the

2043
01:43:47,161 --> 01:43:49,110
same choices.
Yeah,

2044
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:50,400
of course.
BIo,

2045
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:51,980
the,
the difference in

2046
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:56,980
the way human beings respond to various 
foods can obviously be exhibited really 

2047
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:59,270
quickly and easily with allergies.
Food allergies,

2048
01:43:59,390 --> 01:44:00,750
absolutely.
How many people,

2049
01:44:00,751 --> 01:44:03,080
I mean,
we all know someone who has,

2050
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:05,540
like my friend brian,
his mother,

2051
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:10,720
if she eats a Brazil nut,
she's dead and she will chew those 

2052
01:44:12,231 --> 01:44:15,110
things all day and nothing happens other
than I get bored with them,

2053
01:44:15,630 --> 01:44:18,350
especially if she has to pay 600 bucks 
for an epi pen.

2054
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:19,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

2055
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:24,140
There's a lot of different things that 
show the biodiversity of just human 

2056
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:26,060
beings when we come from different parts
of the world.

2057
01:44:26,061 --> 01:44:28,130
Our ancestors came from different parts 
of the world.

2058
01:44:28,131 --> 01:44:31,910
They developed and evolved under 
different diets.

2059
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:35,720
And that's where I think paleo is kind 
of fallen like a.

2060
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:41,980
Maybe has been less successful as a 
concept then it could have been 

2061
01:44:41,980 --> 01:44:46,600
otherwise.
I really believe there's no one size 

2062
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:49,670
fits all approach to diet or life in 
general.

2063
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:51,390
But um,
you know,

2064
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,390
if you take two different people,
for example,

2065
01:44:53,391 --> 01:44:56,760
like a off a person who is primarily 
sedentary,

2066
01:44:56,761 --> 01:44:59,180
it works in an office,
60 pounds overweight,

2067
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:00,850
you know,
prediabetic,

2068
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:02,540
um,
you know,

2069
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:07,660
not doing really any physical activity.
And then you take someone like Michael 

2070
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:09,960
Phelps who's super athlete training,
you know,

2071
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:12,500
burning calories every day.
It's clear.

2072
01:45:12,501 --> 01:45:17,501
It's clear to me that they're going to 
need a completely different dietary 

2073
01:45:17,501 --> 01:45:20,951
approach.
Even if we talk about within a certain 

2074
01:45:20,951 --> 01:45:20,951
template or are,
you know,

2075
01:45:20,951 --> 01:45:21,620
choice of foods,
you know,

2076
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:23,900
Michael Phelps is going to need a lot 
more carbohydrate.

2077
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:26,600
He's going to need lot higher calorie 
intake in general.

2078
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:32,020
He's going to need more nutrients.
He's gonna need to be eating more 

2079
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:32,020
regularly.
You know,

2080
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:34,070
intermittent fasting is not going to 
work for him probably.

2081
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:37,220
Um,
but it's amazing to me how often that is

2082
01:45:37,221 --> 01:45:38,990
completely left out of the equation.

2083
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:39,590
When,
when,

2084
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:41,720
when there's discussion of diets,
you see,

2085
01:45:41,721 --> 01:45:44,000
you know,
the books on everyone should be on a low

2086
01:45:44,001 --> 01:45:46,640
fat diet.
Then the next crazy low carb,

2087
01:45:46,641 --> 01:45:47,340
everyone,
you know,

2088
01:45:47,370 --> 01:45:52,370
carbs are toxic.
We shouldn't eat carbs and then you 

2089
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:54,931
know,
everyone should be on paleo and never 

2090
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:55,760
touched another grain or lagoon or dairy
product for the rest of their life.

2091
01:45:55,790 --> 01:45:57,500
You know,
that's just stupid.

2092
01:45:57,530 --> 01:46:02,530
That's not the way it works is really 
important when you're talking about 

2093
01:46:02,530 --> 01:46:06,761
people like ultra marathon runners or 
people like Michael Phelps or just 

2094
01:46:06,761 --> 01:46:10,210
burning off massive amounts of calories.
When you think about how much energy is 

2095
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:14,441
involved in those sprints that he's 
doing across the pool and the training 

2096
01:46:14,441 --> 01:46:16,430
for those,
which is just unbelieVably grueling.

2097
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:21,670
Yeah.
I read this thing about him eating like 

2098
01:46:21,670 --> 01:46:21,830
several pizzas at night and you look at 
him and he's shredded.

2099
01:46:21,831 --> 01:46:26,831
It doesn't zero body fat,
like obviously his body's doing 

2100
01:46:26,831 --> 01:46:26,831
something with that.

2101
01:46:26,831 --> 01:46:28,790
It's kind of important.
I think that is very important.

2102
01:46:28,791 --> 01:46:31,100
Also when you're talking about sedentary
lifestyles,

2103
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:36,160
contributing to diseases and in factors 
like high blood pressure and clogging of

2104
01:46:38,571 --> 01:46:40,610
the arteries and you're just,
your,

2105
01:46:40,611 --> 01:46:45,611
your body is less likely to be healthy 
when you're not doing much with it,

2106
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:47,810
period.
AbSolutely.

2107
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:50,440
And uh,
I mean,

2108
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,770
I think that can work both ways.
On the one hand,

2109
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:57,270
phelps would probably be better off 
choosing a different calorie source than

2110
01:46:57,271 --> 01:46:59,040
pizzas,
you know,

2111
01:46:59,041 --> 01:47:00,200
arguably,
I don't know.

2112
01:47:00,290 --> 01:47:05,290
But uh,
so he can get away with a lot more than 

2113
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:08,390
I can say that he shouldn't be doing 
anything differently than what is the 

2114
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:11,600
most successful swimmer.
Isn't he like the most successful 

2115
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:11,600
olympian?
I think.

2116
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:12,360
Yeah.
I don't think anyone's one any more gold

2117
01:47:12,361 --> 01:47:13,770
medal.
So what the heck do I know?

2118
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:15,810
Just keep on doing whatever you're 
doing.

2119
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:16,710
It's working.

2120
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:17,640
Um,
no,

2121
01:47:17,641 --> 01:47:19,610
but I think genes play a role,
you know,

2122
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:23,190
for sure you take a coming back to 
people like michael are rich,

2123
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:26,370
like I think rich could probably eat,
almost,

2124
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:31,690
could have a lot of different diets and 
still be and still be phenomenal.

2125
01:47:32,570 --> 01:47:37,570
I've had rich on the podcast before and 
he sort of explained his transition to 

2126
01:47:37,570 --> 01:47:40,380
being a vegan and it came from being 
really unhealthy and eating terrible,

2127
01:47:40,381 --> 01:47:44,970
piss poor diet,
eating super healthy and eating a really

2128
01:47:44,971 --> 01:47:49,971
nutrient dense vegetables constantly and
only that primarily and you know,

2129
01:47:50,131 --> 01:47:54,780
obviously had a massive benefit from 
changing from the standard american diet

2130
01:47:54,781 --> 01:47:57,150
that you outlined to this vegan diet.
Right.

2131
01:47:57,580 --> 01:47:58,840
MAkes you wonder what he,
you know,

2132
01:47:58,850 --> 01:48:02,190
what might have happened if he had done 
switch to like a paleo diet.

2133
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:03,120
Oh,
don't say that.

2134
01:48:03,130 --> 01:48:07,410
So nobody wants to hear that.
Right.

2135
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,700
It's like,
it's not,

2136
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:13,720
it's,
it's one of those things that gets a 

2137
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:13,720
hit.

2138
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,070
There's an ideological wall that cannot 
be crossed and so no one even wants to 

2139
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:18,540
look at the possibility of it being 
physically beneficial.

2140
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:20,190
You just say,
that is not an option.

2141
01:48:20,191 --> 01:48:22,890
I'm a vegan and this is what I do.
That's fine.

2142
01:48:22,891 --> 01:48:23,880
You know,
I don't,

2143
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:29,180
like I said,
I'm not invested in changing anyone's 

2144
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:29,180
mind about that.
Nor should you be.

2145
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:29,180
Yeah.
Um,

2146
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:31,470
I want to go back to two things.
One thing I want to go back to was your,

2147
01:48:31,490 --> 01:48:33,720
you're talk about talking about fish 
oil,

2148
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:35,580
like the long term,
uh,

2149
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:39,780
negative aspects of consuming fish oil.
Like what were those?

2150
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:41,740
So,
um,

2151
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:46,970
early on,
I mean the history is kind of important 

2152
01:48:46,970 --> 01:48:50,031
to see how,
because it illustrates the number of 

2153
01:48:50,031 --> 01:48:50,031
principles that we've been talKing 
about.

2154
01:48:50,031 --> 01:48:50,130
So early research that,
you know,

2155
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:53,160
they looked at traditionally knew it 
people and said,

2156
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:58,190
wow,
these people don't really have heart 

2157
01:48:58,190 --> 01:48:58,190
disease.

2158
01:48:58,190 --> 01:48:58,190
What is it about their diet that could 
explain this?

2159
01:48:58,410 --> 01:49:03,410
Wow.
They eat mostly seal blubber and they 

2160
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:04,650
have enormous intake of omega three 
fats,

2161
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:09,710
so it could be an omega three fats and 
then they start doing research and they 

2162
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:13,911
find that there is an inverse 
association between omega three fat 

2163
01:49:14,761 --> 01:49:19,761
consumption,
like in seafood and cardiovascular 

2164
01:49:19,761 --> 01:49:19,761
disease risk.
In other words,

2165
01:49:19,761 --> 01:49:23,960
people who eat more fish have fewer 
heart attacks and die of cardiovascular 

2166
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:23,960
disease,
much less.

2167
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:25,800
Okay.
So pretty promising so far.

2168
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:27,600
So then it's like,
okay,

2169
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:31,230
why don't we then give people fish oil 
supplements?

2170
01:49:31,470 --> 01:49:34,110
And so they give people fish oil 
supplements.

2171
01:49:34,111 --> 01:49:35,820
They do some,
some research on that,

2172
01:49:35,821 --> 01:49:38,570
that short term.
And find that yes,

2173
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:41,130
there are,
there do appear to be some benefits from

2174
01:49:41,131 --> 01:49:42,990
fish oil supplementation,
short term,

2175
01:49:43,770 --> 01:49:48,220
but then over a longer period of time 
and met analysis

2176
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:53,220
of longer term studies.
They find that the benefits of fish oil 

2177
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:54,820
I've probably been significantly 
overstated.

2178
01:49:54,821 --> 01:49:59,440
And then in fact in some cases high 
doses of fish oil for an extended period

2179
01:49:59,441 --> 01:50:04,441
of time actually appear to cause harm.
And so there are few few important 

2180
01:50:05,711 --> 01:50:10,711
principles here.
Number one is the the folly of looKing 

2181
01:50:10,901 --> 01:50:15,901
at one super isolated unusual population
like the traditional in us who live in a

2182
01:50:16,331 --> 01:50:21,331
really marginalized environment and 
looking at their diet and then 

2183
01:50:21,331 --> 01:50:25,021
extrapolating that to us who don't live 
in the arctic and don't have their diet 

2184
01:50:28,271 --> 01:50:31,360
or lifestyle and didn't evolve.
You can evolve up there.

2185
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:33,730
And,
and interestingly enough,

2186
01:50:33,731 --> 01:50:38,731
some recent studies have found that the 
nun have certain genetic adaptations 

2187
01:50:38,731 --> 01:50:43,210
that allow them to thrive on very high 
doses of omega three,

2188
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:45,970
which we don't have.
So,

2189
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:48,400
so that illustrates the problem with 
taking,

2190
01:50:48,401 --> 01:50:48,940
you know,
saying,

2191
01:50:48,941 --> 01:50:51,430
oh this works for the anyway,
so it should work for us.

2192
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:53,920
it doesn't actually work that way.
And now we know why,

2193
01:50:53,921 --> 01:50:56,270
it's because of the genetics.
Um,

2194
01:50:56,650 --> 01:51:01,650
the second folly and this happens all 
the time and it's kind of a uniquely 

2195
01:51:01,931 --> 01:51:03,220
american thing.
It's like,

2196
01:51:03,310 --> 01:51:04,720
oh,
a little bit as good.

2197
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:06,940
Well,
a lot must be even better.

2198
01:51:07,050 --> 01:51:12,050
That's me as he stares.
Is bullet proof coffee over there?

2199
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:15,600
Yeah.
Um,

2200
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:17,350
so yeah,
I,

2201
01:51:17,351 --> 01:51:18,370
uh,
I,

2202
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:23,590
I think what is becoming more clear is 
that eating fish is good.

2203
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:28,890
Taking really high doses of fish oil for
a long period of time may not be now 

2204
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:32,821
what were the negative health benefits 
or the negative health effects rather 

2205
01:51:32,821 --> 01:51:36,540
well,
an increase in cardiovascular disease 

2206
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:37,840
risk in some cases and increase in some 
inflammatory markers.

2207
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:41,770
The thing to understand about omega 
three fats is they're very fragile.

2208
01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:47,010
so fats have different levels of 
susceptibility to something called 

2209
01:51:47,381 --> 01:51:52,381
oxidative damage,
which means a [inaudible] and they 

2210
01:51:52,381 --> 01:51:55,591
combine with oxygen and the fat becomes 
damaged and rancid and then can be 

2211
01:51:55,931 --> 01:51:56,590
harmful.

2212
01:51:56,740 --> 01:51:57,690
And that's,
you know,

2213
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:00,040
brief description without going into the
science.

2214
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:02,950
Um,
and so saturated fats,

2215
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:07,150
because they are saturated with hydrogen
atoms,

2216
01:52:07,151 --> 01:52:11,050
they're not susceptible to oxidative 
damage and they're relatively stable.

2217
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:14,050
It can tolerate the application of 
temperature,

2218
01:52:14,051 --> 01:52:17,410
like when you cook with it or light,
you know,

2219
01:52:17,411 --> 01:52:22,411
so if they're stored in a clear jar,
they're not going to decompose and 

2220
01:52:22,411 --> 01:52:25,510
become rancid.
Whereas polyunsaturated fats are,

2221
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:30,560
are lacking in hydrogen atoms.
They become more susceptible to 

2222
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,451
oxidative stress.
and the most unsaturated fats are the 

2223
01:52:33,451 --> 01:52:37,380
long chain omega three fats.
So this means that they,

2224
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:42,720
this is why you don't cook,
you never hear anyone saying that you 

2225
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:42,720
should cook with fish oil.
You know,

2226
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:43,390
if you cook with it,
you'll,

2227
01:52:43,570 --> 01:52:46,310
you'll damage the fats will become 
rancid and oxidize.

2228
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:51,500
This is why fish oil is stored in opaque
bottles to protect it from light because

2229
01:52:51,501 --> 01:52:54,260
if light hits it,
it will oxidize and become rancid.

2230
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:59,890
And the suspicion is that if we eat,
you know,

2231
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:02,480
we take these high doses of unsaturated 
fat,

2232
01:53:02,481 --> 01:53:05,060
we actually increased the risk of 
oxidative stress,

2233
01:53:05,061 --> 01:53:08,360
which can cause inflammation,
which in turn is the root of all chronic

2234
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:11,240
disease.
So,

2235
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:14,090
um,
what I advise my patients is,

2236
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:17,150
you know,
just eat fish and if for some reason you

2237
01:53:17,151 --> 01:53:20,840
can't eat fish or won't eat fish,
then taking some,

2238
01:53:21,050 --> 01:53:22,840
some fish oil.
Um,

2239
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:28,060
I prefer cod liver oil because it has 
vitamins a and d in addition to epa and 

2240
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:30,530
dha,
but at a relatively low dose or moderate

2241
01:53:30,531 --> 01:53:31,190
dose,
you know,

2242
01:53:31,191 --> 01:53:33,830
maybe like a teaspoon a day,
um,

2243
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:39,050
rather than going for like 20 grams or 
15 grams a day of fish oil.

2244
01:53:39,530 --> 01:53:43,250
So the real issue is in the oxidative 
stress.

2245
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:45,980
So,
and also the,

2246
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:50,990
the,
so the potential of something being 

2247
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:52,880
rancid sort of mitigates or a diminishes
all the positive benefits from it.

2248
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:58,200
But if you can be assured that there was
no rancid,

2249
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:01,220
well no because it can become damaged in
your body.

2250
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:06,420
So there's two types of data.
It can be damaged by heat or lighting 

2251
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:09,140
outside of your body.
That's less of an issue because storage,

2252
01:54:09,230 --> 01:54:10,520
you know,
people know this,

2253
01:54:10,521 --> 01:54:12,540
the producers of these oils,
no it.

2254
01:54:12,541 --> 01:54:16,010
So they store them in,
in a opaque bottles and when you get the

2255
01:54:16,011 --> 01:54:21,011
fish oil,
you're instructed to put it in the 

2256
01:54:21,011 --> 01:54:21,011
refrigerator,
preserve it,

2257
01:54:21,011 --> 01:54:23,650
but inside of your body,
the fats can become oxidized to.

2258
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,870
And historically,
when you look at traditional diets,

2259
01:54:26,871 --> 01:54:31,871
you see that the majority of fat is,
comes from saturated or mono unsaturated

2260
01:54:31,941 --> 01:54:35,090
fat and there's only a small amount of 
fat that comes,

2261
01:54:35,170 --> 01:54:40,170
it's polyunsaturated that they would get
from eating nuts or seeds which are 

2262
01:54:40,170 --> 01:54:42,010
pretty high in polyunsaturated fats and 
olives.

2263
01:54:42,050 --> 01:54:47,050
All of olive oil has some avocados,
has some polyunsaturated fats,

2264
01:54:48,891 --> 01:54:50,890
omega sixes,
um,

2265
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:52,980
but there weren't,
you know,

2266
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:58,060
there wasn't really an opportunity for 
them to be getting really high doses of 

2267
01:54:58,060 --> 01:55:02,170
polyunsaturated fat that you would get 
from taking multiple fish oil capsules 

2268
01:55:02,170 --> 01:55:02,690
in a day.

2269
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:04,850
Um,
so that.

2270
01:55:04,851 --> 01:55:09,851
So that's the issue.
And that's also actually why 

2271
01:55:09,851 --> 01:55:11,600
industrialized seed oils are bad for us.
You know,

2272
01:55:11,601 --> 01:55:13,790
things like corn oil,
soybean oil,

2273
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:19,120
a sunflower and safflower,
like all the stuff that's in chips and 

2274
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:22,691
crackers and cookies and restaurant 
foods primarily is that when those oils 

2275
01:55:23,811 --> 01:55:25,820
get heated,
they become rancid.

2276
01:55:25,821 --> 01:55:29,810
And those rancid oils can be harmful.
Wow.

2277
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:33,120
That is really important information.
You know,

2278
01:55:33,150 --> 01:55:38,150
it's also interesting,
you're bringing up cod liver oil that's 

2279
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:41,231
more like sort of ancient knowledge.
Grandma and grandpa people would have 

2280
01:55:41,231 --> 01:55:43,830
you take a tablespoon of cod liver oil.
You build

2281
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:46,710
your house.
When they were right,

2282
01:55:46,711 --> 01:55:48,780
we talked about retinol,
vitamin a,

2283
01:55:48,781 --> 01:55:52,110
the active form of vitamin a in how it's
not found in very many foods,

2284
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:57,111
just organ meats and pasture raised fats
and a cod liver oil is from liver cod 

2285
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:02,250
livers and the oil is very high in 
vitamin a.

2286
01:56:02,251 --> 01:56:06,230
It's also high in vitamin d,
which a lot of people are deficient in a

2287
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:08,980
and it's has epa and dha.
So again,

2288
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:11,520
this is traditional wisdom.
Our ancestors knew.

2289
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:12,690
They had,
you know,

2290
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:15,660
they may not have scientifically 
understood what the benefit was,

2291
01:56:15,661 --> 01:56:17,760
but they,
they knew through trial and error.

2292
01:56:18,030 --> 01:56:23,030
That is really interesting.
Here's another thing that I wanted to 

2293
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:25,800
bring up that we talked about earlier.
The misconception that unsat,

2294
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:30,860
that saturated fats rather saturated 
fats and cholesterol are bad for you.

2295
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:32,310
You know,
um,

2296
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:37,230
this is something that you hear vegans 
talk about all the time.

2297
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:42,350
They don't do videos about it as 
saturated fats are terrible for you and 

2298
01:56:42,350 --> 01:56:43,430
it's just not true.
Yeah.

2299
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,510
Unfortunately,
they're not current with the science.

2300
01:56:45,511 --> 01:56:50,511
I mean,
even the us dietary guidelines now have 

2301
01:56:50,511 --> 01:56:53,691
no restriction on dietary cholesterol.
So the most recent version of the 

2302
01:56:53,691 --> 01:56:54,840
dietary guidelines,
you look at him,

2303
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:57,240
there is no restriction on dietary 
cholesterol.

2304
01:56:57,270 --> 01:57:02,270
So the vegans are aligning themselves 
with science that's decades old at this 

2305
01:57:02,270 --> 01:57:04,500
point and they're out of step even with 
the conventional,

2306
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:07,590
totally vanilla mainstream dietary 
guidelines.

2307
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:11,370
I don't think they care.
I think it's an ideological thing.

2308
01:57:11,371 --> 01:57:16,371
Yeah.
I think this is something that they 

2309
01:57:16,371 --> 01:57:17,871
have.
They have their bullet points and 

2310
01:57:17,871 --> 01:57:17,871
saturated fats bad.
Yeah.

2311
01:57:17,871 --> 01:57:19,650
And they go to at saturated fats,
consumption of animal products,

2312
01:57:19,651 --> 01:57:21,450
bad cholesterol,
bad.

2313
01:57:21,451 --> 01:57:22,820
So this is based on,
uh,

2314
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:25,470
an old understanding of how heart 
disease develops,

2315
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:28,530
which is kind of the pipe analogy we can
call it.

2316
01:57:28,530 --> 01:57:30,140
So like break it down for us,
chris,

2317
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:34,350
saturated fat and cholesterol are like 
gunk that clog up your pipes,

2318
01:57:34,410 --> 01:57:36,300
right?
That's kinda how we all were taught,

2319
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:37,680
you know,
we all conceive of it.

2320
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:39,480
Um,
so you eat,

2321
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:44,510
you know,
a burger and egg yolks and that just 

2322
01:57:44,510 --> 01:57:48,411
gradually will build up and you know,
as gunk in your arteries and eventually 

2323
01:57:48,481 --> 01:57:52,250
those arteries clogged.
And the occlusion of the arteries,

2324
01:57:52,251 --> 01:57:57,251
this is what causes a heart attack 
because blood can't get through to the 

2325
01:57:57,251 --> 01:57:57,870
heart and it causes a,
an ischemic event,

2326
01:57:58,020 --> 01:58:00,240
no oxygen,
heart attack,

2327
01:58:00,870 --> 01:58:02,460
um,
or you know,

2328
01:58:02,461 --> 01:58:05,890
platforms.
And then the plaque ruptures and that in

2329
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:11,040
it blocks the artery and blood can't get
to the heart and you have a heart 

2330
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:11,040
attack.
So that's kinda the,

2331
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,830
the dominant idea.
And it turns out it's not actually true.

2332
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:15,810
Um,
for one thing,

2333
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:21,460
there was actually just a study 
published that reviewed all of the 

2334
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:25,311
randomized clinical trials that looked 
at substituting saturated 

2335
01:58:25,311 --> 01:58:29,300
polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat.
So they took away people's butter and 

2336
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:33,801
gave them corn oil and soybean oil,
which I don't know how they found that 

2337
01:58:33,801 --> 01:58:34,890
people were willing to take that trade.
But,

2338
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:35,960
um,
vegans,

2339
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:36,420
yeah.
This,

2340
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:41,750
this was at a time where saturated fat 
was seen as harmful and they probably 

2341
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:41,750
gave them margarine.
You know,

2342
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:41,980
some

2343
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:46,980
of that other stuff.
Remember when that was supposed to be 

2344
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:46,980
good.
I can't believe it's not butter,

2345
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:49,390
right?
So terrible for you.

2346
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:52,960
It's hard to find it now.
And so they reviewed 10 studies and they

2347
01:58:52,961 --> 01:58:56,110
found that only one supported this 
notion,

2348
01:58:56,260 --> 01:59:01,260
one of 10 supported this notion that,
that replacing saturated fat with 

2349
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:02,980
polyunsaturated fat,
which was good for you,

2350
01:59:02,981 --> 01:59:07,981
and even that study was flawed because a
much higher percentage of people in the 

2351
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:12,850
control group were we're smoke were 
smokers,

2352
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:17,910
and um,
had some other characteristics that 

2353
01:59:17,910 --> 01:59:21,661
would have made them more susceptible to
having heart disease independent of 

2354
01:59:21,661 --> 01:59:22,150
whatever,
what's going on with their diet.

2355
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:24,070
WaS that intentional?
No,

2356
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:26,930
It was poorly designed study.
Uh,

2357
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:28,630
I dunno,
I mean,

2358
01:59:28,631 --> 01:59:33,631
I guess it depends on whether you think 
the researchers were trying to get a 

2359
01:59:33,631 --> 01:59:35,410
particular outcome or whether you think 
it was just poor design.

2360
01:59:36,070 --> 01:59:41,070
Um,
so there's the early studies suggested 

2361
01:59:41,070 --> 01:59:43,120
that if you eat more saturated fat and 
cholesterol,

2362
01:59:43,150 --> 01:59:48,150
the cholesterol level in your blood 
would go up and they use that as a way 

2363
01:59:48,150 --> 01:59:52,621
of.
And then everyone knew that high 

2364
01:59:52,621 --> 01:59:52,621
cholesterol in your blood causes heart 
attack.

2365
01:59:52,621 --> 01:59:56,861
So if a plus b and b plus c equals c,
then a equals c,

2366
01:59:57,581 --> 01:59:58,690
right?
So,

2367
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:04,200
um,
but that turned out to not actually be 

2368
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:04,420
true on two counts.
Number one,

2369
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:09,450
when they just looked at the direct 
relationship between saturated fat 

2370
02:00:09,671 --> 02:00:11,920
intake and cholesterol intake and heart 
disease,

2371
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:17,070
just taking blood cholesterol completely
out of the equation like let's forget 

2372
02:00:17,070 --> 02:00:21,391
about the mechanism.
Let's just see if people who eat more 

2373
02:00:21,391 --> 02:00:21,430
fat and cholesterol actually have more 
heart attacks.

2374
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:24,610
When they did those studies,
no difference.

2375
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:30,450
People who eat more fat and more 
cholesterol did not have more heart 

2376
02:00:30,450 --> 02:00:33,331
attacks than people who eat less,
so that was a huge problem and then more

2377
02:00:33,821 --> 02:00:36,130
recent studies have found that on 
average,

2378
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:41,220
saturated certainly dietary cholesterol 
intake has nothing to do with serum 

2379
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:41,440
cholesterol levels.

2380
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:46,440
For the vast majority of people,
70 percent of patients won't see any 

2381
02:00:46,901 --> 02:00:51,901
change in their diet,
in their blood cholesterol levels by 

2382
02:00:51,901 --> 02:00:53,350
changing their dietary cholesterol 
levels one way or the other,

2383
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:58,380
and how do you account for the other 30?
They're called hyper responders and that

2384
02:00:58,961 --> 02:01:02,820
may be genetic,
so they may have a certain ape geno type

2385
02:01:02,830 --> 02:01:07,830
that predisposes them to be more 
susceptible to the effects of dietary 

2386
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:11,491
cholesterol.
They may be hyper absorbers of dietary 

2387
02:01:11,491 --> 02:01:14,221
cholesterol,
so they actually absorb more through 

2388
02:01:14,221 --> 02:01:16,060
their gut than a typical person.
But even those hyper responders,

2389
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:20,140
they found that both their total,
their total cholesterol went up,

2390
02:01:20,530 --> 02:01:25,530
but that was because both the good and 
bad cholesterol went up at the same 

2391
02:01:25,530 --> 02:01:29,761
time.
So the effects were seen as being not 

2392
02:01:29,761 --> 02:01:32,380
clinically relevant because although you
saw an increase in the total,

2393
02:01:32,381 --> 02:01:37,381
it was driven by good going up as well 
as the bad going up a little bit.

2394
02:01:37,420 --> 02:01:39,650
So it wasn't thought to be clinically 
significant.

2395
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:45,190
Is it possible that like what we're 
talking about before longterm studies 

2396
02:01:45,190 --> 02:01:48,560
would reveal more because we were 
talking about a certain nutrients.

2397
02:01:48,561 --> 02:01:53,561
When you eliminate them from the diet,
it takes a long time to find the effect 

2398
02:01:53,561 --> 02:01:57,821
or what we're talking about with fish 
oil that maybe if a longterm study 

2399
02:01:57,821 --> 02:01:59,570
showed an increase in dietary 
cholesterol,

2400
02:01:59,571 --> 02:02:00,740
you can see negative effects.

2401
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:06,560
Yeah.
I think long longterm studies could 

2402
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,751
certainly reveal different effects.
I think the biggest question here is 

2403
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:14,750
should we be looking at a blood 
cholesterol levels as the sole arbiter 

2404
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:17,910
of whether something is good or or bad 
for us?

2405
02:02:18,030 --> 02:02:23,030
You know what I mean?
Like let's say someone switches to a 

2406
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:26,550
nutrient dense low carb diet from that 
standard american diet,

2407
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:29,610
and let's say every single thing about 
their health improves.

2408
02:02:29,611 --> 02:02:31,080
They lose weight,
they,

2409
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:32,370
they,
uh,

2410
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:37,700
their insulin levels decrease.
Their blood sugar levels go down on 

2411
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:39,060
their blood pressure levels go down,
their inflammatory markers go down.

2412
02:02:39,550 --> 02:02:41,400
By the way,
this is not a theoretical thing.

2413
02:02:41,401 --> 02:02:43,920
This is something I see every day in my 
practice,

2414
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:49,320
but their total cholesterol goes up.
Is that a bad thing?

2415
02:02:49,350 --> 02:02:50,750
Is that a good thing?
You know,

2416
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:55,760
should,
should they go back to the standard 

2417
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:55,760
american diet eating?

2418
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:55,760
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but if you,

2419
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:59,940
could you explain what is the difference
between bad cholesterol and good 

2420
02:02:59,940 --> 02:02:59,940
cholesterol to the people that.

2421
02:02:59,980 --> 02:03:04,980
Yeah.
So this is a really big over 

2422
02:03:04,980 --> 02:03:09,351
simplification and it was created I 
think by the drug companies to make it 

2423
02:03:09,351 --> 02:03:10,120
seem very simple.
Like,

2424
02:03:10,510 --> 02:03:11,980
you know,
good cholesterol,

2425
02:03:12,370 --> 02:03:13,420
bad cholesterol,
bad,

2426
02:03:13,540 --> 02:03:15,730
our drug lowers your bad cholesterol.
Good.

2427
02:03:15,731 --> 02:03:17,860
You know that that's how simple they 
want it to be.

2428
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:23,460
It's not actually that simple.
So called bad cholesterol actually has 

2429
02:03:23,460 --> 02:03:25,720
some,
some important roles that it plays.

2430
02:03:25,721 --> 02:03:29,470
It wasn't actually just dare to give us 
heart attacks contrary to that,

2431
02:03:29,530 --> 02:03:31,120
you know,
what that model would assume.

2432
02:03:31,630 --> 02:03:36,630
Um,
and what's even more wrong about 

2433
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:41,910
referring to a cholesterol is we're not 
actually what's important is not really 

2434
02:03:44,861 --> 02:03:48,340
how much cholesterol we have.
What's important is the lipoproteins.

2435
02:03:48,341 --> 02:03:51,790
So let me see if I can use an analogy 
here.

2436
02:03:51,791 --> 02:03:56,791
So imagine your bloodstream is like a 
highway and uh,

2437
02:03:56,980 --> 02:04:01,980
the cars on the highway or the 
lipoproteins and the passengers in the 

2438
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:05,761
car are the cholesterol,
the lipoproteins carry around the body 

2439
02:04:05,761 --> 02:04:08,680
and a lipoproteins also carry fat 
soluble vitamins,

2440
02:04:08,681 --> 02:04:12,440
like vitamin a and vitamin d and 
triglycerides and other things that,

2441
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:13,690
that our body actually needs.

2442
02:04:13,690 --> 02:04:18,690
So they're like a taxi service that 
carries cholesterol aNd fats and other 

2443
02:04:18,690 --> 02:04:21,280
nutrients all around the body and takes 
them to the cells where they're actually

2444
02:04:21,281 --> 02:04:22,210
used.
Okay.

2445
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:28,080
So for years it was thought that the 
amount of cholesterol inside the 

2446
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:32,551
lipoproteins was the big issue.
And that's what's measured when you go 

2447
02:04:32,551 --> 02:04:34,300
and you get a liquid panel and uc,
you get your total cholesterol,

2448
02:04:34,301 --> 02:04:39,301
your ldl and your hdl cholesterol.
They're measuring the passengers in the 

2449
02:04:39,301 --> 02:04:43,980
cars,
like how much cholesterol is inside of 

2450
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:46,491
those particles,
and that was thought to be the driving 

2451
02:04:46,491 --> 02:04:49,431
factor for risk for heart disease.
We now know that it's not really the 

2452
02:04:49,921 --> 02:04:52,710
cholesterol inside of the particles that
makes a difference.

2453
02:04:52,711 --> 02:04:56,130
It's how many particles you have.
So to use,

2454
02:04:56,131 --> 02:05:01,131
come back to this analogy.
If you have a highway and you've got a 

2455
02:05:01,131 --> 02:05:04,101
whole bunch of cars on the highway,
it's as likely that want more likely 

2456
02:05:04,101 --> 02:05:05,880
when I'm gonna go off the road and 
crash,

2457
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:06,330
right?

2458
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:09,480
And they'll crash into the artery,
the site,

2459
02:05:09,490 --> 02:05:14,190
the endothelial wall of the artery,
and it'll damage the artery and they.

2460
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:19,250
And that's what initiates this whole 
process of plaque formation that 

2461
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:20,070
eventually leads to heart disease.
So it's literally like volume.

2462
02:05:20,490 --> 02:05:25,490
It's a gradient driven process.
So if you have a high number of 

2463
02:05:25,490 --> 02:05:27,130
particles in the luminal space of the 
artery,

2464
02:05:27,140 --> 02:05:31,110
they will try to diffuse across the 
lumen.

2465
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:34,790
So it was an issue with overeating.
No.

2466
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,000
So,
uh,

2467
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:41,600
so what we're talking about here is the 
number of particles and all of the 

2468
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:44,070
things that I talked about earlier that 
raised cholesterol.

2469
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:47,820
What I was actually referring to is 
things that raise ldl particles.

2470
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:52,880
I Just didn't want to go into all of 
this nuance at the risk of confusing 

2471
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,840
people.
So ldl versus hdl.

2472
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:59,870
Yeah.
So you have ldl particles and you have 

2473
02:05:59,870 --> 02:06:00,300
hdl particles.
Ldl stands for low density lipoprotein,

2474
02:06:00,301 --> 02:06:02,340
hdl for high density lipoprotein.

2475
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:07,020
And traditionally ldl particles have 
been viewed as bad.

2476
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:12,200
That's the bad cholesterol.
And hdl particles have been viewed as 

2477
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:13,740
good and there is something,
there's definitely something to that.

2478
02:06:13,741 --> 02:06:15,090
The,
um,

2479
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:18,690
the single most important risk factor 
like marker from a,

2480
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:23,770
from a blood lipid standpoint are the 
two most would be l,

2481
02:06:23,970 --> 02:06:28,970
ldl particle number,
and another lipoprotein called 

2482
02:06:28,970 --> 02:06:33,410
lipoprotein little a.
So I'm coming back to our analogy.

2483
02:06:33,991 --> 02:06:37,740
If you have a whole lot of ldl particles
are a whole lot of cars on the road,

2484
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:42,890
there's more of a chance that one of 
them's going to damage the artery and 

2485
02:06:42,890 --> 02:06:44,430
then that whole process of plaque 
formation is going to,

2486
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:50,180
is going to occur.
And that's what increases the risk of 

2487
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:54,171
heart disease.
So the name of the game is to keep your 

2488
02:06:54,171 --> 02:06:58,881
ldl particle number down.
and when we talk about the things that 

2489
02:06:58,881 --> 02:06:59,480
increase it,
you know,

2490
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:03,210
going back to early in the interview,
genetics do play a role.

2491
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:08,240
diet definitely plays a role.
But then also things like thyroid 

2492
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:08,340
function,
infections,

2493
02:07:08,341 --> 02:07:13,341
inflammation and leaky gut play a role.
So it's not happening in isolation,

2494
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:15,040
you know,
it's our,

2495
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:15,930
it's,
once again,

2496
02:07:15,931 --> 02:07:17,920
we have to look at our whole health,
you know,

2497
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:19,800
our diet,
how we sleep,

2498
02:07:19,801 --> 02:07:24,801
how we live,
whether we have infections or 

2499
02:07:24,801 --> 02:07:24,801
inflammation or guts,
guts,

2500
02:07:24,801 --> 02:07:28,050
stuff going on.
And I have many patients,

2501
02:07:28,290 --> 02:07:33,290
I'm often guys who kind of be their only
complaint is that they have high 

2502
02:07:33,290 --> 02:07:34,620
cholesterol and now I don't know if 
they're not.

2503
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:37,390
If they are,
they really are 100 percent healthy.

2504
02:07:37,391 --> 02:07:40,810
And that's the only complaint we test 
their ldl particle number.

2505
02:07:40,811 --> 02:07:43,420
It's high.
They say they have no gUt issues,

2506
02:07:43,421 --> 02:07:45,340
they have no fatigue,
no,

2507
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:50,370
no other health problems at all.
But then I test their gut and I do all 

2508
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:54,361
these testing and we find issues.
We address those issues and their ldl 

2509
02:07:54,361 --> 02:07:55,810
particle drops by 30,
40,

2510
02:07:55,811 --> 02:07:58,330
even 50 percent sometimes.
Wow.

2511
02:07:58,750 --> 02:08:00,840
Which is more than you would expect from
a staton.

2512
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,690
So.
So this again,

2513
02:08:04,691 --> 02:08:09,691
this is another one of those things.
It's way more nuanced than it than it's 

2514
02:08:09,691 --> 02:08:13,261
made out to be.
And it is true that ldl particles play 

2515
02:08:13,821 --> 02:08:17,620
an important role in the,
in how heart disease develops,

2516
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:22,980
but this dominant paradigm notion that 
saturated fat and dietary cholesterol 

2517
02:08:23,981 --> 02:08:27,460
are the main things that influence our 
ldl particle number is false.

2518
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:32,610
My friend anthony bourdain was taking 
statents cause he,

2519
02:08:32,620 --> 02:08:37,620
he,
he used to eat a lot when still eats a 

2520
02:08:37,620 --> 02:08:39,130
lot and he was developing high blood 
pressure and you know,

2521
02:08:39,210 --> 02:08:42,630
the,
all the issues that were just outlining,

2522
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:46,210
he started training every day doing 
brazilian jujitsu,

2523
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:49,350
like got really obsessed with it.
No longer has to take stanton's right.

2524
02:08:49,630 --> 02:08:52,410
Changed his,
changed his cholesterol profile,

2525
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:56,250
which is really kind of fascinating.
I'm sure he's eating healthier,

2526
02:08:56,820 --> 02:08:59,490
but to me that's a,
that's a,

2527
02:08:59,550 --> 02:09:01,200
that's,
that's a very strange thing.

2528
02:09:01,201 --> 02:09:06,201
Like what?
What is happeNing that's causing his 

2529
02:09:06,201 --> 02:09:07,360
cholesterol to drop because of exercise 
at 58.

2530
02:09:07,900 --> 02:09:09,820
Did he lose weight?
Lost a lot of ways.

2531
02:09:10,230 --> 02:09:15,230
Thirty pounds.
The fastest way you can normalize your 

2532
02:09:15,230 --> 02:09:15,370
cholesterol profile,
a profile in your,

2533
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:20,550
your really your ldl particle number,
which is even more important and your 

2534
02:09:20,550 --> 02:09:24,430
blood pressure is weight loss,
but why is it a contributing factor?

2535
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:29,700
It's just there's a whole constellation 
of metabolic changes that happens when 

2536
02:09:29,700 --> 02:09:33,130
we become overweight that include 
insulin resistance and leptin resistance

2537
02:09:33,200 --> 02:09:35,890
of the gut issues.
you outlines all the gut issues,

2538
02:09:35,891 --> 02:09:40,891
inflammation,
and this creates like a glue that leads 

2539
02:09:40,891 --> 02:09:41,200
to dyslipidemia,
which is this.

2540
02:09:42,430 --> 02:09:47,430
So each particles,
so we talked about this at the cars on 

2541
02:09:48,011 --> 02:09:50,320
the road,
a car can only hold so much,

2542
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:52,300
so many passengers,
right?

2543
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:57,840
and if you have a lot of fats,
the fats will take up all the space and 

2544
02:09:58,691 --> 02:10:03,691
the cars and you will need more cars to 
carry a given amount of cholesterol 

2545
02:10:04,330 --> 02:10:09,330
around the body because we need 
cholesterol for sex hormone production 

2546
02:10:09,330 --> 02:10:10,690
and other things that you mentioned 
earlier in the show.

2547
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:14,800
So if you have a lot of triglyceride,
a lot of fat in your liver,

2548
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:20,280
the liver will maKe more ldl particles 
because it needs more particles to carry

2549
02:10:20,771 --> 02:10:23,170
the amount of cholesterol that needs to 
get around the body.

2550
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:26,590
So that's actually what's happening and 
that might've been too much detail,

2551
02:10:26,620 --> 02:10:30,460
but that's why when you're overweight 
and you have more fat,

2552
02:10:31,090 --> 02:10:34,670
you actually have a higher ldl particle 
and when you loSe weight,

2553
02:10:34,750 --> 02:10:36,800
the converse happens,
you,

2554
02:10:36,810 --> 02:10:40,280
you need fewer particles to transport 
the same amount of cholesterol,

2555
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:43,670
so your ldl particle will go down,
your,

2556
02:10:43,820 --> 02:10:44,810
your,
uh,

2557
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:47,480
insulin and leptin sensitivity will 
improve,

2558
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:52,540
your gut may improve also,
and your blood pressure will typically 

2559
02:10:52,911 --> 02:10:56,360
go down because the heart doesn't need 
to work as hard to pump as much blood.

2560
02:10:56,580 --> 02:10:58,800
It makes sense.
Um,

2561
02:10:58,970 --> 02:11:00,920
the,
the terminology of

2562
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:05,150
bad cholesterol versus good cholesterol 
is Kind of problematic,

2563
02:11:05,151 --> 02:11:08,870
isn't it?
Because it doesn't ldl play some sort of

2564
02:11:08,871 --> 02:11:11,780
beneficial roles if you don't want to 
eliminate ldl?

2565
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:12,680
No.
I mean,

2566
02:11:12,681 --> 02:11:14,810
some have argued that it should be zero,
but I don't,

2567
02:11:14,970 --> 02:11:17,840
I don't think that that makes much sense
biologically.

2568
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:22,940
I'm one role that it plaYs is it's 
antimicrobial ldl particles are 

2569
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:24,630
antimicrobial,
um,

2570
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:27,280
so that if,
if toxins do get into the bloodstream,

2571
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:31,820
like lip lipopolysaccharide for example,
a ldl particles can be,

2572
02:11:31,850 --> 02:11:36,850
will be manufactured to deal with that,
and that's one reason why chronic 

2573
02:11:36,850 --> 02:11:40,091
infections increase ldl particle number 
because the body is attempting to deal 

2574
02:11:40,091 --> 02:11:42,380
with that infection and the toxins.
Um,

2575
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:47,980
as I mentioned as well,
the ldl particles are like a taxi 

2576
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:48,800
service that carry nutrients to 
different parts of the body,

2577
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:54,220
fat soluble vitamins and fats liKe 
triglycerides and antioxidants too that 

2578
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:58,160
we need to function properly.
So I think it's a question of balance.

2579
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:03,220
You know,
we want to keep our ldl particle and 

2580
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:05,990
arrange that contributes to health and 
doesn't increase our risk substantially 

2581
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:06,020
for

2582
02:12:06,270 --> 02:12:07,680
disease.
Yeah.

2583
02:12:07,681 --> 02:12:12,681
It's one of those things that it's,
it's so over simplified in the way 

2584
02:12:13,561 --> 02:12:16,680
people describe them.
That sort of leads people to think,

2585
02:12:16,681 --> 02:12:21,681
well,
I just need to take a stat and almost 

2586
02:12:21,681 --> 02:12:23,910
take a pill and this is the way it's 
being described to people that have 

2587
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:27,861
these issues by doctors and these very 
brief seven minute minute meetings that 

2588
02:12:27,861 --> 02:12:32,040
they're having with their doctors for 
the next person in line gets in this.

2589
02:12:32,370 --> 02:12:37,370
It's a really bad system.
It's a really bad system that and look 

2590
02:12:37,430 --> 02:12:42,430
where we're having this conversation and
I'm a person who obviously I didn't go 

2591
02:12:42,430 --> 02:12:46,521
to school for this and I'm trying to 
take all this stuff in over a period of 

2592
02:12:46,531 --> 02:12:51,210
years of reading and watching 
documentaries and talking to people like

2593
02:12:51,211 --> 02:12:55,090
you and dr rhonda patrick and and you 
know,

2594
02:12:55,170 --> 02:13:00,170
so many different people.
Rob wolf and so many dIfferent people 

2595
02:13:00,170 --> 02:13:03,291
that are experts in nutrition and the 
way the body processes nutrients and I'm

2596
02:13:04,231 --> 02:13:09,231
still baffled by a massive amount of it.
Given the many,

2597
02:13:09,241 --> 02:13:09,810
many,
many,

2598
02:13:09,811 --> 02:13:12,570
many,
many hours I've been paying attention to

2599
02:13:12,571 --> 02:13:13,130
it.
You know,

2600
02:13:13,390 --> 02:13:15,240
it's incredibly complex.

2601
02:13:15,490 --> 02:13:17,890
So complex.
I mean it's liKe any other pursuit.

2602
02:13:17,891 --> 02:13:20,490
I think the more you know,
the last,

2603
02:13:20,510 --> 02:13:22,320
you know,
the more you can just say,

2604
02:13:23,170 --> 02:13:25,660
you realize that you can spend your 
lifetime,

2605
02:13:25,990 --> 02:13:30,990
you know,
learning about this and you still have 

2606
02:13:30,990 --> 02:13:32,130
many lifetimes to go before you felt 
like you really could master it.

2607
02:13:32,290 --> 02:13:37,290
Yeah.
I think dennis mckenna had a great way 

2608
02:13:37,290 --> 02:13:37,290
of describing.
I'm learning something and realizing how

2609
02:13:37,290 --> 02:13:38,170
little you learn.
That one,

2610
02:13:38,230 --> 02:13:43,230
the bonfire of understanding increases.
IT illuminates the surface layer of 

2611
02:13:44,411 --> 02:13:45,520
ignorance greater.
Yeah.

2612
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:46,830
I love that.
Yeah,

2613
02:13:47,010 --> 02:13:50,700
that's exactly how I feel about this.
At the same time,

2614
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:55,740
I think our knowledge is advancing and 
we are in a different place even just 10

2615
02:13:55,741 --> 02:13:57,500
years ago than we were 10 years ago.
Yes.

2616
02:13:57,540 --> 02:13:58,980
We understand things.
So

2617
02:13:59,430 --> 02:14:01,410
I think maybe some doctors know,
right?

2618
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:03,710
Like there's a lot of people that would 
talk to their doctor and dr.

2619
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:04,480
Golf,
oh,

2620
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:06,200
that's nonsense.
Oh,

2621
02:14:06,210 --> 02:14:10,920
well these guys and these so called 
experts and they'll go on about it.

2622
02:14:10,950 --> 02:14:14,800
Here's the interesting thing about that.
Number one is that,

2623
02:14:15,090 --> 02:14:20,090
uh,
there's a real lag time between what's 

2624
02:14:20,090 --> 02:14:23,080
in the scientific literature that anyone
can access.

2625
02:14:23,081 --> 02:14:24,820
Now you know,
I mean they may not,

2626
02:14:24,821 --> 02:14:27,520
you may average person doesn't have 
access to the full text,

2627
02:14:27,521 --> 02:14:32,521
but anyone could go to pubmed.gov
and pull up abstracts from the hundreds 

2628
02:14:32,521 --> 02:14:37,030
of thousands of scientific studies that 
are published and you will see if you do

2629
02:14:37,031 --> 02:14:38,790
that.
I mean if you're inclined to do that,

2630
02:14:39,230 --> 02:14:40,490
that they're,
you know,

2631
02:14:40,650 --> 02:14:45,650
the,
the vast majority of recent research 

2632
02:14:45,650 --> 02:14:48,481
suggests that saturated dietary,
saturated fat and dietary cholesterol 

2633
02:14:48,481 --> 02:14:50,260
are not major risk factors for heart 
disease.

2634
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:55,800
But the time it will take for that 
knowledge to percolate down to the 

2635
02:14:55,800 --> 02:15:00,151
average primary care provider is not 
weeks or months or even years.

2636
02:15:00,340 --> 02:15:05,340
It's probably decades because that's how
long it took for the idea that saturated

2637
02:15:06,761 --> 02:15:10,120
fat and dietary cholesterol are bad for 
us to get hammered into our heads.

2638
02:15:10,121 --> 02:15:15,121
I mean,
that started in the fifties and it 

2639
02:15:15,121 --> 02:15:17,491
didn't really sink in,
I don't think until the eighties or the 

2640
02:15:17,491 --> 02:15:17,491
nineties,
you know,

2641
02:15:17,491 --> 02:15:21,481
with the boneless chicken,
skinless chicken breast and the bagels 

2642
02:15:21,481 --> 02:15:22,440
with no butter or cream cheese and the,
you know,

2643
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:24,980
like that was my generation like that,
you know,

2644
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:27,670
pasta,
carb loading and that whole thing.

2645
02:15:28,150 --> 02:15:31,210
That was 30 years aFter this whole 
campaign started.

2646
02:15:32,020 --> 02:15:37,020
and unfortunately I think it's going to 
take another couple of decades and 

2647
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:40,810
hopefully it will go faster this time.
And in there are some signs that it is 

2648
02:15:40,810 --> 02:15:43,300
going faster.
But the average primary care provider,

2649
02:15:43,630 --> 02:15:46,450
they're seeing patients 30,
40 hours a week.

2650
02:15:46,990 --> 02:15:48,880
They have families,
they have other,

2651
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:51,110
you know,
that theIr own health to consider.

2652
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:54,100
They're not going home at night and 
reading the scientific literature.

2653
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:57,430
They are trying to take care of their 
patients,

2654
02:15:57,431 --> 02:16:02,431
trying to live their own life and they 
only know what they were taught in 

2655
02:16:02,431 --> 02:16:02,470
medical school,
which,

2656
02:16:02,650 --> 02:16:07,650
you know,
unless they're doing continuing 

2657
02:16:07,650 --> 02:16:09,031
education and the medical school tech 
textbooks are out of date as soon as 

2658
02:16:09,031 --> 02:16:10,170
they're printed.
Uh,

2659
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:14,140
and they're based on studies that were 
done 50 or 40 or 50 years ago.

2660
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:19,860
So this is a huge problem in medical 
education is that the current research,

2661
02:16:20,590 --> 02:16:21,170
you know,
the,

2662
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:26,280
the public policy and the standard of 
care is not based on the most recent 

2663
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:31,231
research and,
and the peer reviewed evidence that we 

2664
02:16:31,231 --> 02:16:34,290
available to us now.
It's based off and on research that's 

2665
02:16:34,290 --> 02:16:34,290
decades old.

2666
02:16:34,290 --> 02:16:38,350
This stuff takes so long.
The process people have these podcasts 

2667
02:16:38,350 --> 02:16:42,461
and they go over him three or four times
and start taking notes and just try to 

2668
02:16:42,461 --> 02:16:46,331
make these changes in their life.
If you wanted to give someone advice as 

2669
02:16:46,331 --> 02:16:50,111
to what is the best way to proceed.
If someone's listening to this podcast 

2670
02:16:50,111 --> 02:16:50,111
and they say,
okay,

2671
02:16:50,660 --> 02:16:53,600
obviously I really need to know what's 
going on in my gut.

2672
02:16:53,690 --> 02:16:55,610
I need to know what'S going on with,
uh,

2673
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:56,690
my,
my,

2674
02:16:56,780 --> 02:16:59,110
my overall blood lipids,
my health.

2675
02:16:59,510 --> 02:17:01,220
Well yeah,
my nutrient density.

2676
02:17:01,221 --> 02:17:01,850
But what,
what,

2677
02:17:01,851 --> 02:17:03,680
what do,
what does the average person to do?

2678
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:03,940
Yeah.

2679
02:17:04,190 --> 02:17:08,390
So I think the first very first thing is
I can set them up in three words,

2680
02:17:08,391 --> 02:17:11,540
eat real food.
And you know,

2681
02:17:11,541 --> 02:17:13,400
you can talk about paleo,
primal,

2682
02:17:13,401 --> 02:17:14,600
paleo template.
Okay,

2683
02:17:14,601 --> 02:17:15,930
that's bad.
You know,

2684
02:17:16,190 --> 02:17:19,520
I would argue that that's a step above,
but just eating real food,

2685
02:17:19,521 --> 02:17:22,280
like avoiding things that come in a bag 
or a box,

2686
02:17:22,640 --> 02:17:24,080
you know,
butter comes into box.

2687
02:17:24,081 --> 02:17:25,910
All right,
let's not get too hung up on that.

2688
02:17:25,911 --> 02:17:27,400
But you know what I mean?
When can say that,

2689
02:17:27,470 --> 02:17:30,290
right?
Actual actual real food,

2690
02:17:30,650 --> 02:17:35,650
vegetables that come out come out of the
ground and fruits and nuts and seeds and

2691
02:17:36,141 --> 02:17:38,090
some,
even some tubers,

2692
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:40,790
sweet potatoes,
I think white potatoes get a bad rap and

2693
02:17:40,791 --> 02:17:43,070
they're fine for most people as long as 
they're not,

2694
02:17:43,150 --> 02:17:48,150
you know,
fried and crappy oil and the skins are 

2695
02:17:48,150 --> 02:17:48,150
actually really good for you.
Good for you.

2696
02:17:48,150 --> 02:17:48,830
And you know,
eat some,

2697
02:17:48,860 --> 02:17:51,770
some good pasture raised organic if 
possible,

2698
02:17:51,771 --> 02:17:55,490
animal products and wild caught fish.
Um,

2699
02:17:55,820 --> 02:17:58,340
if yOu can do that,
and I really think that,

2700
02:17:58,390 --> 02:18:03,390
that,
that would solve 80 percent of people's 

2701
02:18:03,390 --> 02:18:06,221
problems if you're already doing that or
you've already got that down and you're 

2702
02:18:06,221 --> 02:18:10,841
still having additional issues.
ThIs is where functional medicine comes 

2703
02:18:10,841 --> 02:18:14,321
in,
which we've kind of touched on at 

2704
02:18:14,321 --> 02:18:14,321
various points along the way.
Um,

2705
02:18:14,321 --> 02:18:18,820
but this is an,
is a relatively new and fast growing 

2706
02:18:18,820 --> 02:18:22,751
branch of medicine that is focused on 
addressing the underlying cause of 

2707
02:18:22,751 --> 02:18:22,751
illness,
you Know,

2708
02:18:22,751 --> 02:18:26,480
taking the pebble out of the shoe 
instead of just suppressing symptoms.

2709
02:18:26,570 --> 02:18:30,320
And there are several training 
organizations out there.

2710
02:18:30,321 --> 02:18:32,100
Institute for functional medicine is 
the,

2711
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:35,420
is been around the longest and it's 
pretty well known.

2712
02:18:35,830 --> 02:18:38,180
I have kresser institute which just 
started,

2713
02:18:38,570 --> 02:18:42,150
we're trAining the 200.
We have 200 doctors and other healthcare

2714
02:18:42,170 --> 02:18:43,880
professionalS in the program now.

2715
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:49,440
And you can go to these websites and 
look for practitioners that practice 

2716
02:18:49,791 --> 02:18:54,791
functional medicine and unfortunately 
it's not yet at the level where there's 

2717
02:18:54,791 --> 02:18:57,890
one on every corner,
like even like a yoga studio.

2718
02:18:58,470 --> 02:19:00,380
Um,
but it's changing fast.

2719
02:19:00,381 --> 02:19:02,000
And you know,
for example,

2720
02:19:02,390 --> 02:19:07,390
mark hyman,
who's a nine time number one New York 

2721
02:19:07,390 --> 02:19:10,730
times bestselling author dot a health 
expert.

2722
02:19:10,790 --> 02:19:15,790
He recently was tapped to start the 
center for functional medicine at the 

2723
02:19:15,790 --> 02:19:20,770
cleveland clinic,
which is a very prestigious medical 

2724
02:19:20,770 --> 02:19:22,700
institution and they already have a six 
month wait list and it's just,

2725
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:25,380
it's blowing up.
So I think the tide is turning and,

2726
02:19:25,381 --> 02:19:30,381
and pretty soon a lot of people will be 
seeing functional medicine 

2727
02:19:30,381 --> 02:19:31,500
practitioners,
um,

2728
02:19:31,970 --> 02:19:36,970
but these are the practitioners that are
likely to be knowledgeable about how to 

2729
02:19:36,970 --> 02:19:37,190
properly test your,
got,

2730
02:19:37,250 --> 02:19:40,380
how to assess your hpa access,
your stress tolerance and,

2731
02:19:40,440 --> 02:19:41,270
and,
and,

2732
02:19:41,350 --> 02:19:42,740
um,
resilience.

2733
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:46,190
How to look at your functional,
your blood chemistry panel.

2734
02:19:46,220 --> 02:19:48,140
So look at your blood sugar,
your lipids,

2735
02:19:48,141 --> 02:19:50,480
your metabolic function,
your vitamin d or b,

2736
02:19:50,481 --> 02:19:55,481
12 levels.
take all of that information and then 

2737
02:19:55,481 --> 02:19:59,770
create a customized individual plan for 
you based on all of your lab test 

2738
02:20:00,951 --> 02:20:04,400
results,
your current symptoms and signs,

2739
02:20:04,401 --> 02:20:06,650
your health history,
your family history,

2740
02:20:07,550 --> 02:20:11,840
and your lifestyle and put all that 
together and then make a plan for you.

2741
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:14,690
And as you can imagine,
that takes time.

2742
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:15,230
You know,
the,

2743
02:20:15,231 --> 02:20:18,140
the typical first appointment is more 
like an hour and a half,

2744
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:21,920
then seven minutes.
And it's also,

2745
02:20:22,510 --> 02:20:27,510
uh,
can be more expensive because there's a 

2746
02:20:27,510 --> 02:20:29,471
lot of lab work that's done up front to 
try to figure out what's causing the 

2747
02:20:29,471 --> 02:20:33,431
problems.
But I would argue that it's less 

2748
02:20:33,431 --> 02:20:36,320
expensive over the longterm because when
you address the root of the problem,

2749
02:20:36,770 --> 02:20:41,770
the,
the treatment is going to be way more 

2750
02:20:41,770 --> 02:20:42,170
effective and it's going to be way 
longer lasting.

2751
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:48,200
And I think I can say from my own 
personal experience from someone who's 

2752
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:53,091
changed their diet in eliminated almost 
all sugar in terms of like added sugar,

2753
02:20:54,330 --> 02:20:55,440
very,
very little.

2754
02:20:55,470 --> 02:20:57,750
Do I take in a daily basis are 
eliminated.

2755
02:20:58,050 --> 02:21:02,970
Almost all simple carbs and my energy 
levels are so much better.

2756
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:05,520
Um,
I don't craSh like I used to.

2757
02:21:05,610 --> 02:21:09,390
I feel like overall my health is better.
I talked about my,

2758
02:21:09,391 --> 02:21:14,391
um,
increased over the last few years of 

2759
02:21:14,391 --> 02:21:14,910
probiotics,
made a giant benefit,

2760
02:21:14,950 --> 02:21:19,950
made.
It made a huge impact in terms of my 

2761
02:21:19,950 --> 02:21:21,450
ability to recover from illnesses,
my ability to avoid on the sis.

2762
02:21:21,630 --> 02:21:24,300
And I have little kids so my kids are in
travel,

2763
02:21:24,301 --> 02:21:27,960
which I travel in airplanes and just 
like disease vector labs,

2764
02:21:27,961 --> 02:21:32,961
you know.
But I survived them so much better than 

2765
02:21:32,961 --> 02:21:34,020
a lot of my peers who don't take care of
themselves the same way.

2766
02:21:34,050 --> 02:21:39,050
It just,
it makes a big difference in that 

2767
02:21:39,050 --> 02:21:41,750
overall quality of life difference is so
significant and it has such an impact on

2768
02:21:42,421 --> 02:21:45,060
your productivity and your energy 
levels,

2769
02:21:45,070 --> 02:21:50,070
your happiness because you're not 
constantly fighting diseases and 

2770
02:21:50,070 --> 02:21:53,691
illnesses.
And that is another thing that people I 

2771
02:21:53,691 --> 02:21:56,691
think ignore or maybe you are not really
aware of is the function of your health 

2772
02:21:59,940 --> 02:22:04,940
and your immune system and your gut 
biome and how it translates into your 

2773
02:22:05,191 --> 02:22:06,600
actual personality.

2774
02:22:07,100 --> 02:22:10,010
That's a huge point.
I'm really glad you brought that up.

2775
02:22:10,130 --> 02:22:15,130
Um,
and it does that in a Couple of 

2776
02:22:15,130 --> 02:22:17,051
different ways.
One Is just the actual chemical 

2777
02:22:17,051 --> 02:22:17,990
influence that we talked about,
the year gut bacteria,

2778
02:22:17,991 --> 02:22:21,380
how it influences your brain.
Brain chemistry can affect your mood,

2779
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:24,570
but the other I think is more,
uh,

2780
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:29,640
related to just how you experienced your
life.

2781
02:22:29,641 --> 02:22:32,520
When you feel good versus when you feel 
crappy.

2782
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:35,160
like you pointed out,
your productivity increases,

2783
02:22:35,161 --> 02:22:38,220
you're just happier,
you have more time to be effective,

2784
02:22:38,250 --> 02:22:43,220
and you're probably able to be more 
present with your kids and your,

2785
02:22:43,310 --> 02:22:48,310
your,
if you're in a relationship with your 

2786
02:22:48,310 --> 02:22:48,310
partner.
And I mean it's,

2787
02:22:48,310 --> 02:22:52,510
it's a dramatic difference.
I think one of the downsides of how 

2788
02:22:52,510 --> 02:22:56,901
adaptable we are as human beings is we 
can get used to some pretty heavy stuff 

2789
02:22:57,540 --> 02:23:02,540
and people who,
a lot of people I think are sick and 

2790
02:23:02,540 --> 02:23:03,510
they're not,
or at least they're not.

2791
02:23:03,511 --> 02:23:04,410
Well,
you know,

2792
02:23:04,411 --> 02:23:08,390
they're not really healthy and there's a
kind of normalization of that.

2793
02:23:08,410 --> 02:23:11,520
The top that happens in our culture,
um,

2794
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:16,880
you know,
it's just common to that people are 

2795
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:18,810
taking drugs,
people are taking more than one drug.

2796
02:23:18,811 --> 02:23:19,340
Uh,
they're,

2797
02:23:19,410 --> 02:23:21,330
they're just,
they don't feel well,

2798
02:23:21,331 --> 02:23:23,720
they're not sleeping well.
Um,

2799
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:26,370
you know,
that's common,

2800
02:23:26,371 --> 02:23:31,371
but I don't think it's normal and 
there's a really important difference 

2801
02:23:31,371 --> 02:23:33,891
between what's common and what's normal.
I think that's an awesome point and I 

2802
02:23:33,891 --> 02:23:33,891
think

2803
02:23:33,891 --> 02:23:35,050
this has been a great conversation.
I really,

2804
02:23:35,051 --> 02:23:38,650
really thank you for coming in here and 
thanks for your awesome website.
