1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,850
Train by day Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,770
Where's Shane Carwyn going?

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,670
Shane Carlin's going Arisun.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,613
Okay.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,783
Yeah,

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,620
he couldn't take it no more.

7
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:12,370
The silence.

8
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:12,761
He's like,

9
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:13,570
fuck it.

10
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,180
I guess he wants to have some
fun while he's still shame.

11
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,310
Carwyn I salute that he could
still hit harder than McKinney did.

12
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,000
Did you see that Jason Ellis fight?

13
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,860
Do you see what crazy Jason Ellis did?

14
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,690
Jay Snell is fought.

15
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,090
Shane Carwyn with one hand tied up.

16
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:28,581
Shane.

17
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:31,960
Karlyn had his right hand tied
up to his body and so Jason,

18
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:32,291
I was like,

19
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,790
you don't realize how big Shane Carwyn is.

20
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,560
Like Jason Nelson is not the tiniest guy.

21
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,071
You know,

22
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:37,510
he's probably about 200 pounds.

23
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,400
Who any stand next to Shane Carwyn.

24
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,040
It is almost comical how it look at this.

25
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,180
Look how big car one is.

26
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:45,883
I mean,

27
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,030
he's a giant.

28
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,910
He's a fucking giant and
he's got one arm tied up.

29
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,850
Look at this and he looks good dude.

30
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:53,810
Like physically,

31
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,890
he looks jacked.

32
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,540
Like he hasn't fought in a while,

33
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,130
but obviously he's been working out.

34
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,520
I mean he looks better than he did
the did the last time I saw him,

35
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:02,900
the last time I saw him,

36
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:06,560
he was a recovering from some
injuries and he was still in the UFC.

37
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,990
So apparently he's a
free agent and I think,

38
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,501
you know,

39
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:12,920
he's,

40
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,560
he's fighting for rise
and I'm pretty sure,

41
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:15,801
I mean,

42
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:17,480
I know we put it on his Instagram page,

43
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,680
but uh,

44
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,690
he k man,

45
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,590
he,

46
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,770
it's really kind of wrong.

47
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,183
Look,

48
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:26,241
oh,

49
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:26,930
that was one,

50
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,040
that was one punch.

51
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,420
Did he hit him with that wasn't even
though the punch at that k Odom is it?

52
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,341
No,

53
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:36,640
that,

54
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,340
that was like at the end of around,

55
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,183
I think,

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,100
see this is where it k Odom right here.

57
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,270
So that was the second one.

58
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,760
I mean that one really Kayo and I'm like,

59
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:50,110
you could see when he
was down he was like,

60
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,340
fuck.

61
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,490
I mean that guy is so God damn big.

62
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,860
Carlin's a gigantic human.

63
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,690
So they were talking
about setting him up with,

64
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,330
or like fate or versus car when,

65
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,380
I don't know if that's gonna happen,

66
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:03,190
but if that does,

67
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,023
I'm in,

68
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,283
I'm in,

69
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:11,010
I'm paying to see that that's a dangerous
fight for faith for dangerous fires.

70
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:11,950
Right.

71
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,783
Japan,

72
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,050
it's essentially the same guy who
was a charge of a pride for awhile.

73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,233
Yeah.

74
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:19,901
And uh,

75
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:20,734
I believe so.

76
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,940
And so,

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,300
uh,

78
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,800
if he goes over and fights,

79
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,240
if Carl and goes over and fights in Japan
and he fights fade or as a giant fight

80
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,431
last time,

81
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:31,010
afraid off,

82
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,780
fought,

83
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,320
fought Fabio Maldonado and
barely squeaked by a fight,

84
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,600
a lot of people thought that he
should have lost you got hurt.

85
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,290
Fabio Maldonado tagged them
and there's no shame in that.

86
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,124
Fabio [inaudible],

87
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,830
Fabio Maldonado is a very good boxer.

88
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,140
He rocked Glover to
share before glow over,

89
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:47,974
finished him off.

90
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,120
And uh,

91
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,620
he's just tough as shit and he's a tough,

92
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:51,220
tough guy.

93
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,710
They always call that poor guy in like,

94
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:54,430
they always,

95
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,630
Fabio Fabio's like,

96
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,650
who are we going to get old fighter
who will be this fucking wacky fight on

97
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,484
short notice?

98
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,080
Fabio Maldonado,

99
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,050
you remember how he saved
that fight in Australia?

100
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,610
In Brazil?

101
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:07,600
Some way.

102
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,800
Phots steep bay at heavyweight steep
Emile chick when Steve Bay's is just

103
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,180
fucking tearing through the ranks.

104
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:13,451
Right.

105
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:17,530
Steve Bay's trying to get a shot at the
title and he fights Fabio Maldonado.

106
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,813
I just,

107
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,241
I mean,

108
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,620
Steve Bay just ran through them.

109
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:21,460
It was horrific.

110
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,031
And Steve,

111
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:26,560
but he's a scary guy as a heavyweight
and Fabio Maldonado just was not the same

112
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,200
size,

113
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,960
just did not belong in there with them.

114
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,793
You know,

115
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,080
just too big,

116
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:32,681
too strong,

117
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:33,401
too fast.

118
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,121
It's too hard.

119
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:35,080
It was a scary fight.

120
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,693
But um,

121
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,290
when you think about Fabio Rock and Faye
door and hurting him and his last fight

122
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,100
and you think good lord would if he gets
hit by Carwyn like car car when takes a

123
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:50,470
great shot and he hits harder
than anybody in the division.

124
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:50,801
He's,

125
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:51,634
he's probably,

126
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,760
he's probably one of the scariest
heavyweight punchers ever.

127
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,100
Literally ever when he fought mirror,

128
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:00,790
I remember he,

129
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,530
he tied near up in a
clinch and just ripped up,

130
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,620
cuts to his chin,

131
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,600
his face and put them down and just
beat him down when he's on the ground.

132
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:12,601
Like Carwyn could Faulk and
paunch scary punch her man.

133
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,330
So if he's healthy like he
looks like and that video,

134
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,820
it looks fucking healthy
to me and he looks huge.

135
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,100
It looks like he's like well over to 60.

136
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,930
Yeah,

137
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,790
I dunno fader.

138
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,310
I Dunno if that's the kind of fight
he wants at this stage of his life.

139
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,640
You know,

140
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,900
after he fought Maldonado,

141
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,270
he might be looking to
fight smaller heavyweights.

142
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,310
He might be looking to fight bigger names,

143
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,180
will actually comments pretty God damn
big name as far as the free market.

144
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,640
But who knows what's going to happen,

145
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:40,240
man.

146
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,073
You know,

147
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,161
with,

148
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:42,730
um,

149
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,950
one of the crazy things with
all these new organizations,

150
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,450
whether it's one FC,

151
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,381
whether it's,

152
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:47,800
uh,

153
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,250
you know,

154
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,230
fill in the blank Bella tour,

155
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,120
rise in all these other,

156
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,320
like everyone is scrambling to
pick up anybody who leaves the UFC.

157
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,570
So if people's contracts are up,

158
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,470
like they're starting to do and they
start bolting over and go into these other

159
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,640
different organizations,

160
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,080
stuff can get crazy.

161
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:09,940
Like things can heat up and you might
see like another pride UFC type rivalry,

162
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,890
which I think would be
great for everybody.

163
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,380
Like if if rise and really does take off,

164
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:18,610
like if rise and puts on fate or versus
shame Carwyn and then they come up with

165
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,860
a bunch of other crazy
fights for the undercard,

166
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,163
you know,

167
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,070
just,

168
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,810
there's just not right now the same level
of talent available outside the UFC.

169
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,213
Not right now,

170
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,301
but man,

171
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:34,330
it's been close a few
times and it used to be,

172
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:34,811
you know,

173
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,520
obviously it used to be with pride.

174
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,870
It's hard to make it
something like that happen,

175
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,290
you know,

176
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,000
I feel with like a Shane car when,

177
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:43,834
for example,

178
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,470
Shane carn was a great fighter.

179
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,380
He hasn't thrown a
punch in how many years?

180
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,180
Um,

181
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,840
he hasn't fought MMA since,

182
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,370
I want to say it's two years ago.

183
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,331
Two,

184
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:55,931
three years.

185
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:56,480
Okay.

186
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,313
If the,

187
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,400
in my world,

188
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,880
I dunno,

189
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,660
I dunno,

190
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,830
I'm not the professional here,

191
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:03,350
but I think the UFC marketing would know.

192
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,660
They could do something with
a Shane cow and if they,

193
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,890
if they passed on them,

194
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,870
maybe there's something they can do.

195
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:10,370
The heavyweight division is packed.

196
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,910
I Dunno.

197
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,430
I Dunno.

198
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,440
Parameters of this,

199
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,580
you know,

200
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,330
I feel like when a fighter hasn't fought
more than a year or two or maybe even

201
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:18,164
three,

202
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,360
I think about comedy.

203
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:21,194
Joe Rogan,

204
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,250
when I think about it,

205
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,470
probably just didn't do any
company for three years.

206
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,860
What would I be ready for?

207
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,731
What would you,

208
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:29,510
you didn't do any comedy for three years.

209
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:33,380
What would you honestly book
yourself for and fucking December.

210
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,940
It's October 31st what would you book
yourself on the December the garden,

211
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,341
you know,

212
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:42,380
you do like the laughing
skull and Atlanta.

213
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,523
Okay.

214
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,340
A nice cool intimate little room.

215
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:47,174
Very quiet.

216
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,440
99 Cedar.

217
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,820
Shane might not have a lot of money and
the rising might have offered them a big

218
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:53,121
chat.

219
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:53,271
No,

220
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:55,220
I understand all these parameters,

221
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,420
but I'm saying to you is,

222
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:57,740
you know,

223
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,630
it's like the GSP thing that was going
on and maybe they weren't what they were.

224
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,880
And I think even as a finer two,

225
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,714
three years,

226
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,010
shit is fucking change.

227
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,050
I can change.

228
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,913
Yes and no.

229
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,843
Here's the no,

230
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,320
depends on if you're still training,

231
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,280
see if you decide to take some time off
because you have nagging injuries or

232
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,090
some fighters like that.

233
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,830
Joseph volatility and you guy
were talking about earlier,

234
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,890
he stepped back because of concussion
syndrome cause he's getting,

235
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,160
he,

236
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,491
you know,

237
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:26,240
he had too many hits to the head and so
he recognized it was having some real

238
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,040
symptoms and he said no I have to resign.

239
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:28,371
So he,

240
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:33,371
he gave up his belt and taking two or
three years off if you're having any sort

241
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,660
of real problem,

242
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,790
maybe if you've got a
reoccurring back injury,

243
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,460
which I know Shane had some back issues.

244
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,520
He even had surgery.

245
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,090
Yes.

246
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,010
So maybe taking that time off.

247
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:48,011
So it was junior dos Santos was his last
loss and that was UFC one 31 and wow.

248
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,040
2011.

249
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,230
So that's five fucking years ago.

250
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,470
Fucking the Fado I love him to death.

251
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:54,771
You know,

252
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:56,270
I caught the tail and the Fado,

253
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,410
you know,

254
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,740
I caught like the two fights
before he got on board.

255
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,480
Right by a boy.

256
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,890
Well he got our bart first.

257
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,780
And you saw the fights
that he won before that?

258
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,111
Yeah,

259
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:06,944
like two fights.

260
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,723
Yeah.

261
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:09,711
And then,

262
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:10,544
uh,

263
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,350
he beat Brett Rogers and then,

264
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:12,830
um,

265
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,930
I think the next fight after Brett Rogers,

266
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,240
pretty sure it was fair to him.

267
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,110
I didn't catch fade or in his hay
day is what I'm trying to say.

268
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,990
So the last couple of times I went,

269
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,810
it was like how people said they wanted,

270
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,260
they went to watch x at the
end and they got all excited.

271
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:27,410
It went down so a lot.

272
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:28,780
And then he got submitted by,

273
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,540
uh,

274
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,110
for doom,

275
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,621
the doom.

276
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:34,100
What you and I discussed it this
could fucking be doing for him.

277
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,320
He's got a nasty guard.

278
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,810
There's another guy we
were talking about yet.

279
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,750
Nasty guard.

280
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,500
Yeah.

281
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,500
So then I saw a couple pieces of the
last fight that was fucking embarrassing.

282
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,073
That was fucked up,

283
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,700
both of them.

284
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,080
But at the Fabio I love,

285
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:55,100
I love his fucking jaw that he takes a
fight at short notice and then he fought

286
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,790
that Indian gentlemen before that.

287
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,170
Yeah.

288
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:57,750
So,

289
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,860
but Fado I mean,

290
00:08:58,861 --> 00:08:59,441
now you just,

291
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:01,830
we're exploiting the guy and
that's how people get hurt.

292
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,300
I don't think freight all wants to fight.

293
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:03,630
If he would've,

294
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,900
he fought for fucking years and he killed
was killing people and all of a sudden

295
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:07,740
he didn't fight for one.

296
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,150
My wants to make a comeback.

297
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,481
I don't know.

298
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:10,500
His brother got out of jail.

299
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,970
His brother just got out of jail.

300
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,630
Is that true?

301
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,930
Yeah.

302
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,201
Okay.

303
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,850
I did read that and get ready to fight.

304
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,810
Say you're doing nothing but pushups.

305
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,240
Yeah.

306
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,850
Working out in jail still come out.

307
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,860
Jack new tattoos.

308
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,290
I like,

309
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,260
if he wants to fight,

310
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,730
I want them to be able to fight.

311
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,730
Just like I wanted them to be able to
fight when he was 20 I want to deal with a

312
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:31,200
fight when he's 40 if he wants to.

313
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,393
Why not?

314
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,150
Okay.
