1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,460
Just press the music.
Let's just go right with music.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,830
We have no uh,
no commercials today.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,470
I like it.
Golden.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,730
What?
Commercial Free Ladies and gentlemen for

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,120
brought to you by the universe.
Okay.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,480
Experience Joe Rogan podcast all day.
Ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,940
a very special episode podcast,
sponsorship free,

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,390
Dennis Mckenna and Josh Twickenham.

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,130
Josh is from the Ethno Ethno Botanical 
Stewardship Council,

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,190
one of the founders of this.
And what exactly does that mean for 

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,451
folks who have no idea what ethno 
botanical or stewardship means?

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,580
A lot of people struggle with counsel.
It sounds like you're counseling people 

13
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,990
and ethno botanical stewardship.
Look,

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,430
imagine bringing that up at a party.

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,760
Well,
the ESC is dedicated to transforming 

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,570
lives through assuring the safety and 
sustainability of traditional plants.

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,900
So that means a trans transforming 
people's lives through experiences with 

18
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:12,121
plants.
But it also means the sustainability of 

19
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:15,000
plants and the safety in their use.
So we're starting with Iowasca and uh,

20
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:15,730
it bogus.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,540
Yeah,
you should.

22
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,350
You shouldn't start with like ferns.
People don't get excited about a,

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,700
it's hard to get eucalyptus.
People really want to get fired up about

24
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,230
that.
But Iowaska,

25
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,730
anything involving tryptamines for folks
who've experienced it,

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,100
it's something worth saving.
Exactly.

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,160
You guys find it odd that in this day 
and age,

28
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:41,161
in 2014,
the average person who you would go up 

29
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:44,020
to to try to discuss these issues with 
would have no idea what you were talking

30
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:44,290
about.

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,440
Actually,
I think over the last few years that's 

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,771
kind of changed.
A IOWASCA is emerging into mass 

33
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:56,430
consciousness and I think that's,
that's a good thing.

34
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:59,370
I would say 10 years ago,
15 years ago,

35
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:02,820
if you approach the average person on 
the street and you've said Iowasca,

36
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,280
they'd look at you like you had a speech
impediment or select,

37
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,390
but chances are people would recognize 
it now and not in necessarily know what 

38
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:18,201
it's about.
Not necessarily have a negative or a 

39
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:20,901
positive view of it,
but the meme is out there and I think 

40
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:25,371
that's a good thing.
Ultimately it's most certainly a good 

41
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:25,371
thing.
I agree with you.

42
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:26,310
That means it's certainly out there with
young folks.

43
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,560
But with folks,
um,

44
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,430
I'm 46 of folks my age and older,
it gets a little sketch,

45
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,540
you know,
it's like,

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,500
wait a minute,
what,

47
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,670
what are you doing?
Folks who already have mortgages and 

48
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,050
families?
Those are the ones that's very difficult

49
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:43,710
to get them to even consider what you're
talking about.

50
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,100
You'd be surprised the ESC has sent out 
a call for experts and we've been until 

51
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,010
infiltrated by the mainstream people 
that do evaluation work for the World 

52
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,570
Bank and USA id.
They're interested in Iowasca.

53
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:02,571
People are going down to south to have 
these transformative experiences to sit 

54
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:05,470
in ceremony.
There's a lot of underground activity in

55
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,710
the US as well in Europe where it's not 
legal,

56
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:13,711
but in South America and Peru,
Iowasca is protected as national 

57
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:13,711
patrimony.

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,180
That's awesome.
Yeah.

59
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,270
So beautiful.
Do you ever worry that you're being 

60
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:20,700
infiltrated by government agents who,
uh,

61
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,380
who would want that?
I mean,

62
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,010
I'm not doing anything illegal.
We're working in countries where Iowa 

63
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,640
Ska is,
has been used for hundreds of years 

64
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,221
traditionally,
and we're looking at increasing the 

65
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:38,450
safety of it so that we're creating a 
kind of self regulatory model.

66
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,690
So that we can take that model to places
where it's illegal and say this is a 

67
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,200
totally safe medicine if you do it 
right.

68
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,400
People with certain medical conditions 
shouldn't take Iowasca,

69
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,760
but uh,
done with a skilled curandero or shaman 

70
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,210
in the right setting.
It can,

71
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,270
it can be helpful for all sorts of 
psychological issues or ptsd or 

72
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,650
depression and just give people a new 
perspective on their lives.

73
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,540
Most certainly.
I mean,

74
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:11,090
I'm completely joking around,
but what I was saying when I was like,

75
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,350
you know,
that hasn't happened with marijuana 

76
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,480
marijuana is they're still fighting it 
tooth and nail despite all the evidence 

77
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,960
that it's not just beneficial but 
probably prevents a lot of cancers and 

78
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,731
does a lot of fantastic work with ptsd 
and with anxiety and all sorts of 

79
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:31,600
issues,
medical issues,

80
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:36,601
you know,
interocular pressure for people with 

81
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:36,601
Glaucoma and you know,
on and on and on.

82
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:39,160
People with aids that are having a hard 
time keeping their appetite up.

83
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:41,290
Cancer patients,
I mean it's still,

84
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,340
they fight it tooth and claw and Iowasca
is a completely different barrel of 

85
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,211
monkeys.
WASC is coming at this through the back 

86
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:54,381
door and I mean it's interesting that it
has gained recognition over time to the 

87
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:01,210
extent that it does and to a certain 
extent I would say it's,

88
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,590
you know,
Josh,

89
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,770
people like Josh and me,
we say we work for the plants,

90
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,190
right?

91
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,450
And ios has got its own agenda 
interestingly,

92
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:15,451
and people go down to South America and 
they have these experiences that are 

93
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:20,071
regulatory and self transforming,
but often they come back with an 

94
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:24,991
enhanced ecological consciousness and 
enhanced awareness of the connection 

95
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:29,200
between humanity and nature.
The idea that nature is threatened.

96
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,590
And I think if Iowasca is sort of a 
messenger from the community of species 

97
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,150
that's trying to,
you know,

98
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,940
tell the the,
these monkeys to wake up,

99
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:41,230
you clowns,
you know,

100
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,270
it's,
you know,

101
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,950
we're coming down to the wire it,
we're in a crisis here.

102
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:49,951
You've got to really understand where 
you fit into nature and do what can be 

103
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:54,580
done in the ever shrinking time that's 
left.

104
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,910
So people come back with this renewed 
sort of awareness of the 

105
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,920
interconnectedness of life and that we 
have a role in this.

106
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,950
You know,
we primates and we have to really 

107
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,741
understand what our role is as,
as stewards of nature rather than 

108
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,050
exploiters of nature.
And I was,

109
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,720
you know,
that's the message that delivers to many

110
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:21,220
people and unexpectedly they may not be 
going there to,

111
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,130
uh,
you know,

112
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,440
to experience that.
But that's what they come away with.

113
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,750
From your work and from your brothers 
work.

114
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,910
Terence Mckenna,
what,

115
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,930
what I got a that I'd never considered 
before was that psychedelics in,

116
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:41,101
in various forms may very well be 
responsible for why we are human beings 

117
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:46,591
in the first place.
And our separation from them might be 

118
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:50,041
the whole reason why we're so haywire.
Why we're missing a crucial ingredient 

119
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,770
involved in the creation of cognitive 
thought in the first place.

120
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:58,771
The creation of this ability to look at 
ourselves and communicate our ideas and 

121
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,950
really become a human being.
And then we were separated from the 

122
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,691
mother and left to our own devices and 
all of our wild animal instincts sort of

123
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:15,391
take over and our animal instincts sort 
of don't coexist peacefully in this 

124
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,930
weird world that we've created as human 
beings.

125
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,290
And then we create chaos because of it,
because we can't see what we're doing.

126
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,700
Right.
IOWASCA allows you to see what you're

127
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,160
IOWASCA.
Yes.

128
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:30,650
I asked her refocuses the whole 
understanding.

129
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,530
I think of the relationship that we have
that we have to nature.

130
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,550
And I think that's what,
you know,

131
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,560
if you believe in plant intelligence,
I mean there are different ways of 

132
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:42,720
looking at plant intelligence,
but it's,

133
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,860
it's interesting how often people,
you know,

134
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,350
they come out with this renewed 
understanding and I think that's,

135
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,630
that's,
you know,

136
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:56,631
a desperate to call on the part of the 
community of species and Ios has been 

137
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,940
delegated to be,
to kind of lead that conversation.

138
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,490
It's fascinating that Iowasca is the one
that's been in the forefront when 

139
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,990
mushrooms are so damn easy to grow.
You could,

140
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,740
I mean anyone can essentially get ahold 
of some spores and start cooking them in

141
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:17,741
your basement like really quickly.
Whereas IOWASCA is probably the most 

142
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:22,721
complex common atory beverage that we 
know of as far as like psychedelic 

143
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:27,371
bruise.
It's the one that requires the most 

144
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:27,560
knowledge.
It's the one that requires the most care

145
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:32,561
and creating.
And it's easier to extract DMT and than 

146
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:37,301
it is to create iom and get all the 
plants and brew it together and know 

147
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:37,460
someone who really knows what they're 
doing,

148
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:41,720
how to cook up a good batch.
It's weird that that's the one.

149
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,410
Yeah,
it has its.

150
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,540
I think it's because it is so 
interesting.

151
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,010
You know,
it,

152
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,910
it,
it's escaped from its home in the Amazon

153
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:57,150
and that's the area on the planet with 
the greatest bio diversity and all that.

154
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:59,490
But it's got all those associations,
you know,

155
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,260
people regard it.
I mean mushrooms are also important,

156
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:07,380
but they just don't seem to carry that 
same.

157
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,400
I don't know what it is.
Emotional kick Iowasca gives the one 

158
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,240
right now that's getting all the 
attention,

159
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,170
you know.
And,

160
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,780
and it's quintessentially a plant.
Mushrooms aren't plants,

161
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:23,730
so maybe that's part of the disconnect.
I'm not sure.

162
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:28,731
But you know,
all of these things in indigenous 

163
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:29,520
cultures are regarded as plant teachers.
And,

164
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,480
and as you mentioned,
a lot of it comes down to trip to being 

165
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,120
chemistry.
And you know,

166
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,170
our brains for some reason are 
evolutionarily prime to react to 

167
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,030
tryptamines.

168
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,180
I mean,
we have these tryptamine detectors for 

169
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,450
some reason and I think it's partly that
we can,

170
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,510
so that we can receive and interpret 
what they're trying to tell us and what 

171
00:09:57,451 --> 00:10:02,451
they're trying to tell us is there's not
much time left and we have to really,

172
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:05,010
really understand our relationship to 
nature.

173
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:07,860
We have to realize that we're not 
separate from nature.

174
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,890
Well,
you're trying to overcome at least 2000 

175
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:13,740
years of Judaeo Christian history.
And,

176
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,540
and you know,
the,

177
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,600
those traditions,
they're 10.

178
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,650
Their whole agenda in a certain sense is
to devalue nature.

179
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,990
You know,
nature is something that we own.

180
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,200
It's there for us to exploit.
It's up there for us to rape.

181
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:31,260
And,
and we're busy doing that because,

182
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,610
you know,
my,

183
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,780
my problem with those religions is the 
focus is always on the afterlife.

184
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:39,690
So it tends to make you devalue this 
life.

185
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:41,210
It makes you,
uh,

186
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,790
you know,
it,

187
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,100
it,
it teaches people to devalue nature,

188
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:49,101
to devalue their bodies,
to devalue personal experience,

189
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,200
uh,
all of these things.

190
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:56,970
And that leads to the very out of 
balance situation that we have going.

191
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,650
And uh,
you know,

192
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:03,651
what's,
what's disturbing to me is that we're 

193
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:04,680
all part of this circle of,
of the converted.

194
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:05,120
I mean,
we,

195
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,110
we got the memo,
you know,

196
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,070
and,
and the meme is spreading,

197
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,530
the memo is spreading,
but I'm not sure it's fast enough.

198
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,500
Do you think that it's possible that the
human race is essentially cramming?

199
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:24,130
You know how when you're about to do a 
test and you put it off till the last 

200
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,370
minute and then you know,
the day before you're like,

201
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:27,500
Holy Shit,
I gotta deal with this.

202
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,200
And then you'd go bananas.
You'd taken adderall.

203
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:32,930
You filed through books until your head 
wants to explode.

204
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,720
That is a characteristic that's very,
very common for people that want to 

205
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,690
attack a project.
Especially an important project.

206
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:47,130
It's almost like we have this thing 
where it has to be completely 

207
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,660
overwhelming where it can't be ignored.
And then we go into it full throttle.

208
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,170
Is it possible that the human race is 
and that maybe part of our self 

209
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,901
destructive tendencies are actually us 
recognizing that we're fucking up and 

210
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,390
going into it more chaotically,
more materialistically,

211
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:08,530
more shallow,
more nonsense,

212
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:11,380
more Kim Carr,
dash in more American idol,

213
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:16,381
more horse shit just to get you to the 
point where you get so sick of it,

214
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,880
you,
you,

215
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,000
you puke it up and then move on.
Yes.

216
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,600
Yeah,
and we're in the middle of an ecological

217
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,690
crisis and time is running out and we 
certainly are cramming.

218
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:30,580
We're,
we're destroying the Amazon.

219
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:32,510
We're destroying the climate.
We're destroying

220
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,040
the ocean.
We're destroying the air.

221
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,230
We're destroying everything.
We get our greasy little hands on,

222
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,540
and this is the first time in the 500 
years of European colonization of the 

223
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:47,451
Americas that there's a kind of reverse,
a reverse sort of message coming from 

224
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,480
the Amazon.
People are going there not to convert,

225
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,530
but to be converted,
to learn to learn the traditions and the

226
00:12:55,531 --> 00:13:00,531
indigenous people.
Ninety five percent of their population 

227
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,140
was wiped out by viruses or wars or 
plagues.

228
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,090
And,
and now we have this opportunity to come

229
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:11,091
back from the brink and work with 
Iowasca that grows in the canopy of the 

230
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:15,000
rain forest.
You can't have Iowasca without the trees

231
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,270
and it's so it's an alternative to 
mining and oil exploitation and there's 

232
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,760
money to be made in it.
And I think coming back to cannabis,

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the reason the dialogue is starting to 
change is because governments are 

234
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,730
realizing there's a lot of money to be 
made.

235
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,510
Taxation.
It's a solution to budget crises.

236
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,290
Um,
and the same with Iowaska tourism.

237
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:42,291
I don't like to say tourism because 
people are legitimately seeking a 

238
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:46,821
spiritual experience.
Some people just want to go have an 

239
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:46,821
experience,
but yeah,

240
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:48,070
assuming wrong with the word tourism.
But I know what you're saying.

241
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:51,550
Like the frivolous.
I think it does.

242
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,840
I think we,
you know,

243
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,120
I,
I think I asked it,

244
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:56,990
tourism is a beautiful way or a 
pilgrimage.

245
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:01,540
Yaps is [inaudible].
I think that tourism is a,

246
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,810
is a phase in our relationship to 
Iowasca.

247
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:08,710
I think that I think that potentially if
we couldn't,

248
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,010
you know,
what I view is going on now is kind of a

249
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:15,790
rough period.
But what is really being played out here

250
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,530
is the co-evolutionary relationship with
these plants that have gone on,

251
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,060
as you say,
ever since we became cognitive beans.

252
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:30,061
In fact,
it was the plants that triggered that 

253
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:30,630
and now and that conversation is going 
on and that,

254
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,640
but now the conversation has gone to a 
new level where Iowasca before was kind 

255
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,090
of,
you know,

256
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,770
the,
the,

257
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:43,771
it was under the stewardship of 
indigenous people confined to the 

258
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:43,771
Amazon.

259
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:46,180
Now it's circling the globe.
And I think this is partly,

260
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:51,181
this is what plants do.
They like to spread and they're 

261
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,350
spreading out into different cultures.
And the plant itself is now,

262
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,080
you know,
even if the Amazon is destroyed,

263
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,890
which it may well be,
I ask is not going to be destroyed.

264
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,990
It's too late.
It's already escaped.

265
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,780
But I think,
you know,

266
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,670
hopefully we can arrest this process.
But,

267
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:09,410
uh,
what you're seeing is,

268
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,130
has always been a evolutionary 
relationship where,

269
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,680
you know,
at some time,

270
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,900
some points it's more quieter,
it's underground,

271
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:21,530
but at some point says as the crisis 
deepens,

272
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:24,920
it's becoming more and more public in a 
sense.

273
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,910
Uh,
and,

274
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:28,130
uh,
I think that's what you see going on,

275
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,950
you know,
and,

276
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,170
and potentially I think that Iowaska,
you know,

277
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:38,171
we're now discovering that it's good for
so many things,

278
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,330
you know,
therapeutically for addictions,

279
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:44,510
for depression,
for ptsd and that sort of thing.

280
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,510
And that's all to the good.
But we shouldn't make the mistake of 

281
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:53,540
thinking Iowasca is only for sick 
people,

282
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,320
you know,
it's,

283
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:59,321
it's,
we're all wounded and we all need to 

284
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:00,680
understand something about our 
relationship to nature,

285
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:06,340
potentially the paradigms that are 
emerging in Ios get tourism or these 

286
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,870
more,
you know,

287
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:12,170
these eyewash gets centered spiritual 
communities in the states.

288
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,390
Potentially this has the,
uh,

289
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,340
this may transform mental health care in
this country.

290
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:24,341
It may transform psychiatry and from 
that it might transform medicine and it 

291
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:30,011
might actually transform all these other
institutions that we have to deal with 

292
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:34,361
whose values have become twisted over 
2000 years of,

293
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,510
of bullshit and,
and indoctrination.

294
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,130
Uh,
you know,

295
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,310
these institutions are not going away 
and they're fine.

296
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,340
They just need to rediscover a moral 
dimension to the consequences of their 

297
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:51,320
action,
if that makes any sense.

298
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,430
You know,
uh,

299
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:57,570
our cleverness far exceeds our wisdom 
and that's a problem.

300
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:03,731
That's the problem we've got to become 
wise and when we couple that with our 

301
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:10,211
ingenuity and our cleverness,
them will be on the way toward saving 

302
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:11,840
the planet,
saving ourselves.

303
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,130
I think there's also this growing 
understanding of all the factors that 

304
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,601
encompass a healthy person and how many 
of them have to do with your conception 

305
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:23,830
of reality.
How many of them have to do with the way

306
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:26,830
you think,
how many of them have to do with how you

307
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:29,890
view your environment.
If you view your environment as hostile,

308
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:32,410
stressful,
antagonizing,

309
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,820
angry,
negative place,

310
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:38,020
you'll get sicker and your body fight.
It doesn't know what to do.

311
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:43,021
It's fighting it constantly and you're,
you're in a battle and you're all 

312
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,970
stressed out and you're susceptible to 
all sorts of things and they're in.

313
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:50,971
In that sense,
there's a direct physical between 

314
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:55,401
psychedelic experiences and improved 
health and that's something that people 

315
00:17:55,401 --> 00:18:00,380
really need to understand.
And I think once that catches route,

316
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,450
once people grasp that concept and 
understand the incredible pressure,

317
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:08,320
alleviating alleviating properties like 
our.

318
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:11,280
I can remember one of the first times I 
ever did DMT,

319
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,870
the,
the,

320
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,910
the,
the day afterwards,

321
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,210
like I had this completely different 
view of the world that I had to sort of 

322
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:25,161
apply now all these other and like 
figure out like do all these,

323
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,670
the,
these factors that I've considered as 

324
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,131
being important,
how many of them am I going to throw 

325
00:18:34,131 --> 00:18:34,131
out?

326
00:18:34,131 --> 00:18:37,330
Like the way I described it as like my 
computer rebooted and now only has one 

327
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,231
folder on the desktop and that folder is
labeled my old bullshit and so now I 

328
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,950
have to open this folder and go,
okay,

329
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:45,990
how much of this is valid?
Like Jesus,

330
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,900
this is my whole thought process.
This is my whole mind.

331
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,230
This is how I interface with reality.
Unfortunately some of it made its way 

332
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,660
back in,
you know,

333
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:59,661
and then you know,
I had to do another trip a few months 

334
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:01,640
later and then I threw out more of it 
and it was a sort of a,

335
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,890
a,
a deliberate process of reevaluation.

336
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,530
You can't reject it.
All

337
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,570
good stuff in that folder.
But I think what the DMT experience,

338
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:13,510
the psychedelic experience does,
you know,

339
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,750
that's partly what it does.
I like your analogy of the folder 

340
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,600
because now you're looking at the folder
from the desktop.

341
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,950
You're outside the folder,
you know,

342
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,970
so it's liberated you,
you were imprisoned in the folder 

343
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,211
before.
Now you can look at it from the outside 

344
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:30,211
and you can go through and say,
oh,

345
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:30,211
you know,
delete,

346
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:30,700
delete,
delete,

347
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,660
oh,
this is good.

348
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,380
Let's keep this,
you know,

349
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,500
let's integrate it.
So,

350
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,430
uh,
you know,

351
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,490
ultimately this is a process of a 
personal cleansing both physically and 

352
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:47,581
emotionally and psychologically and your
encounters with these things,

353
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,800
but also cultural cleansing.
You know,

354
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,520
I mean,
there are,

355
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,090
there good memes out there and there are
good things going on,

356
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:56,210
but there's,
you know,

357
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,870
there's so much noise,
there's so much bullshit.

358
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,900
It's hard to sort out what's worth 
preserving and what needs to be 

359
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,340
dispensed with.

360
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,850
I think we're also kind of trapped in 
this weird world of our creations as far

361
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:15,070
as technology as well.
I think that technology,

362
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:20,071
just like corporations,
just like anything that sort of becomes 

363
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:23,570
a force that's constantly growing,
it becomes a,

364
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,950
it has a certain self preservation,
a aspect to it,

365
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,160
and I think that we're completely 
connected to the idea of constant 

366
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,571
innovation and constantly improving 
technology and that also is completely 

367
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:40,441
connected us to materialism because 
materialism is the real driving force 

368
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:43,150
behind constant innovation.
If we all just looked at our laptops and

369
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:43,990
said,
I'm good,

370
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:46,930
are you good?
There's no need to call apple right now.

371
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,270
Hey,
these are fucking great.

372
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,430
Stop right there.
Right?

373
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,610
You literally don't need to improve 
internet speed.

374
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,910
You don't need to improve the laptop.
Everything's wonderful.

375
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,120
Let's stop all this and let's move on to
something else.

376
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:02,470
Well,
that's not what everybody wants.

377
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:03,880
Everybody wants the newest,
latest,

378
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:07,870
greatest,
fastest dual video processor.

379
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:10,150
I want to screen that roles and folds 
and.

380
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,510
But that's part of the trap.
Yes.

381
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:17,100
This idea that we have to keep upgrading
to the iphone 10 or whatever.

382
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:20,310
I mean,
these tools work and there and it in the

383
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:21,800
proper way,
uh,

384
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,440
they can be tremendously important for 
consciousness,

385
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:29,130
evolution and transformation.
That's what the psychedelics are,

386
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,220
they're just tools.
There are kind of technology and like I 

387
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,511
say,
often to my classes and they'll 

388
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:39,750
elsewhere.
Technology in itself is neither good nor

389
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:41,670
bad.
Drugs are neither good nor bad.

390
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:44,280
These technologies,
it's all about how you apply them.

391
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,430
That's where the moral dimension comes 
in.

392
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,760
That's why,
you know,

393
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,700
you can use,
you can misuse technology,

394
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,380
internet technology to,
you know,

395
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,280
propagate whatever the Kardashians are 
doing lately over the Internet.

396
00:21:59,281 --> 00:22:01,590
But you can also change hearts and minds
with,

397
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,410
with those tools.
Like for example,

398
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,410
uh,
you know,

399
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,450
this live streaming symposium that 
we're,

400
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,680
that we're involved with that were our 
mandate is to plug this thing.

401
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,060
But it's important.
You know,

402
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,190
this conference coming up in Amhurst is 
just one example.

403
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,850
Amherst,
Massachusetts amherst.

404
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,740
Oh,
I know it well.

405
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:28,510
It's Capitol of Massachusetts.
Perfect place to do this symposium 

406
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:35,511
that's coming.
That's going to be live stream people 

407
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:35,880
should go to.
It's a cute name,

408
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,870
symposium,
p s y m p o s I,

409
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,260
u m,
and it's going to be live streamed.

410
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,660
And if you go to the website,
uh,

411
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,800
you couldn't sign up for tickets for 
live streaming at one more time for 

412
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,550
people that were struggling.
Posey,

413
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:53,070
m,
P,

414
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:56,220
s y m p o s I,
u m cute,

415
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,360
right?
Yeah,

416
00:22:57,361 --> 00:23:00,450
I'm hard.
I'm posing them.com.

417
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:03,300
And if you go to their website,
what you're going to see right now,

418
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,290
which I had nothing to do with.
You're going to see a little trailer for

419
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:10,410
live streaming and streaming and it's 
actually,

420
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,120
it looks like a stealth advertisement 
for my new product coming out,

421
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:20,300
which is the Dennis Mckenna bobblehead.
I'm in this trailer and I looked like I 

422
00:23:21,361 --> 00:23:23,530
have a movement disorder or something.
Then,

423
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,420
you know,

424
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:24,920
let,
let.

425
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,350
And why do you,
why does it look like you have a 

426
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,350
movement disorder?
Let's,

427
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,430
let's play it.
You want me to play?

428
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,840
I know we're playing it right now.
Okay.

429
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,490
Go to full screen.
You'll see what I mean.

430
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:40,510
I was,
I just looked at it this morning and I 

431
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,761
thought actually this bubble hand ideas.
What's going on here?

432
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,590
Let's see.
I'm just bouncing Hamilton.

433
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Maurice,
how high was the person who made this 

434
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,400
pretty high?
Pretty high.

435
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,080
This is,
he just made it last night.

436
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,580
I looked at it this morning and I said,
seriously,

437
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,400
she really liked this to be on your 
whole page.

438
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,500
There it is.
You know,

439
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,280
the important thing is get past the,
the,

440
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,620
uh,
the trailer and you can,

441
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,660
you can sign up for this symposium,
which is these guys,

442
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,160
these young fellows of NAM pursed are 
really enthusiastic and good,

443
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,340
good people.
They want this conference to have an 

444
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:24,340
impact and I think it will.

445
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,090
Amherst is one of the few places in 
Massachusetts I consider living.

446
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,510
I got familiar with it.
It's great.

447
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:31,680
It's A.
Yeah,

448
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:36,681
I've heard it.
I had an ex girlfriend who moved out 

449
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:36,681
there when I was in high school and I 
used to go out there and visit her.

450
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:36,720
Yeah.
And,

451
00:24:36,721 --> 00:24:37,890
uh,
I remember thinking,

452
00:24:37,891 --> 00:24:42,891
Whoa,
this is like a totally different world 

453
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:44,991
out here.
It's all like birkenstock wearing 

454
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:46,120
strange hippie openminded.
Right?

455
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,190
It's just a weird,
sort of a strange place in the middle of

456
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:54,120
western Massachusetts.
Western Massachusetts is a strange place

457
00:24:54,121 --> 00:24:56,890
in and of itself because you have Boston
w,

458
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,140
which is a very big city,
a very educated,

459
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:03,150
more colleges per capita than anywhere 
else,

460
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,340
but then as you get out of 
Massachusetts,

461
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:10,341
you might as well be in Kentucky for 
about an hour and 20 minutes and then 

462
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:14,421
you get to this weird oasis where like 
the the woods part and then you know,

463
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,820
you have this strange place in amherst 
was really highly educated and open 

464
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,870
minded liberal community.
Well,

465
00:25:21,871 --> 00:25:26,871
I'm not sure I've ever been there,
but I'm looking forward to this 

466
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:26,871
conference.
You did enjoy it.

467
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:27,280
A lot of fun.
Yeah,

468
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:32,540
it really is the perfect place.
It's very much like a very small Austin 

469
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,400
in the middle of of Massachusetts,
but with no music,

470
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,810
not as much music.

471
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,900
The guys organizing the conference 
really are working with the plants and 

472
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,310
for the plants and you don't have to go 
there to participate.

473
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,690
The the beauty beauty is this,
this live sign up for 10 bucks.

474
00:25:48,691 --> 00:25:53,691
You get a screening of neurons to 
nirvana a great film and access to all 

475
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:56,810
the presenters and interview.

476
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,460
Have you interviewed or shown neurons to
Nirvana on your.

477
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,310
No,
I mean it,

478
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,380
you know,
from a technical point of view,

479
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:10,381
I'm not a filmmaker,
you can criticize it from that point of 

480
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:13,831
view,
but as an educational tool for 

481
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:16,501
psychedelics,
I think this is really an interesting 

482
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:19,740
movie and it's the kind of thing you can
sit down with your parents and watch and

483
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:26,070
they will come away.
Maybe some of their assumptions will be 

484
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,070
shaken,
you know,

485
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,450
I mean,
it's a very good educational tool for,

486
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:33,451
under the subtitle is understanding 
psychedelic medicines and it's 

487
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:34,180
entertaining,
done.

488
00:26:34,181 --> 00:26:39,181
And it's a kind of a review of the 
cutting edge research on a,

489
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,210
bout four or five psychedelics,
Mtma,

490
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,330
Lsd,
mushrooms,

491
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:47,420
Iowasca,
uh,

492
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,180
and where the state of the art research 
is on that.

493
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,200
And these,
these,

494
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,870
these chemicals.
You know,

495
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,720
what we need to do,
as we were talking about before,

496
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:02,721
we need to change hearts and minds.
I know it's a Cliche,

497
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:08,180
but these chemicals under the right 
circumstances are actually a way to do 

498
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,860
that.
And coupled with that is education.

499
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Education is so important and that's 
kind of the vision of these gentlemen,

500
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,320
Brett Green and the and his colleagues 
that,

501
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,780
you know,
symposia like this are an important 

502
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,260
component of this because it's a way of 
getting the information out and the more

503
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:32,700
people that can be gotten out to,
the faster the change can be.

504
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,110
Can Be implemented.

505
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:34,710
Yeah.
They.

506
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,830
The change hearts and minds is an 
interesting cliche because we've heard 

507
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,800
it so many times.
It's almost like we've heard Wolf Wolf,

508
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,810
Wolf.
There's wolves,

509
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:43,440
there's wolves.
Holy Shit.

510
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:45,210
There's a wolf,
right?

511
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:50,870
The first time I did any psychedelics,
the first major one besides Mtma was 

512
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:54,180
mushrooms and then that was my first 
experience like,

513
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:56,050
oh my God,
there's a wolf like this is.

514
00:27:56,051 --> 00:28:01,051
This is a totally different thing.
This isn't something that you have to 

515
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:01,500
believe in.
This is something that's unavoidable,

516
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,090
right?
Doesn't matter if you believe in it.

517
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,870
Exactly.
He doesn't care if a parent for it to,

518
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,260
well,
you can't be.

519
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,990
I really don't think you can be.
I think you can be.

520
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,870
The best you can be prepared for is to 
give up.

521
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,030
Just let it go.
Don't fight it.

522
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,670
Being prepared for that.
Take a few yoga classes,

523
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,620
know what it's like to be uncomfortable 
and keep breathing and then just then do

524
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:24,660
it and then listen to it.

525
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,180
Surrender to us.
The message is there.

526
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,090
Yeah.
Will.

527
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,100
You said earlier,
which is a very controversial but oddly 

528
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,111
fascinating thing that plants are the 
reason why we are human beings today.

529
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:41,391
Why in these plant medicines and these 
these psychedelic compounds,

530
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:47,220
w why is that so controversial?
I find that to be incredibly amazing.

531
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,930
When I talked to really intelligent 
people and I bring that idea up and they

532
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:56,931
dismiss it like almost instantaneously 
and I don't understand why because I get

533
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:04,701
it,
that they're connecting the idea of a 

534
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:04,701
drug to a bad thing.
I get that,

535
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:09,620
but when you want to talk about powerful
influences on cognitive thought,

536
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,990
is there any more powerful influences on
cognitive thought than a psychedelic 

537
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,570
drug?
I don't think there is.

538
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,780
I think I.
I don't understand why that wouldn't be 

539
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:20,880
immediately considered at the top of the
list,

540
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,460
top of the short list,
but it's not.

541
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,750
It's Harrison.
See,

542
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,390
that's the thing.
It's an unconventional idea.

543
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,890
I mean,
if you look at,

544
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,080
you know,
we as a species,

545
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:36,081
we evolved in the rain forest initially 
and we evolved in an environment of 

546
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:43,120
incredible chemical diversity,
you know,

547
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,520
and it's absurd to assume,
you know,

548
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:50,580
and the reason they're such chemical 
diversity in the plant kingdom is that 

549
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,560
they're great chemists,
you know,

550
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,610
and they make all these chemicals for 
whatever purposes.

551
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,780
That's how plants mediate their 
relationship with their environment,

552
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,490
right?
They,

553
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,800
they substitute biosynthesis for 
behavior.

554
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,720
This is what I say,
this is a cliche.

555
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,170
They can't react to their environment 
through behavior.

556
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:10,300
They can't run away,
they can't fight.

557
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,640
They fight through chemistry.
At,

558
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,150
on the other side of that coin is we are
chemical systems.

559
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:18,070
I mean,
I hate to break it to you folks,

560
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:20,800
but we're made of drugs,
right?

561
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,550
That's why drugs work.
We're biochemical engines.

562
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,510
Our brains are biochemical engines that 
run on neurotransmitters.

563
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,710
These plant compounds are our 
neurotransmitters essentially.

564
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:34,080
I mean,
you know,

565
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,240
they were in plants a long time before 
they were in our brains before they was 

566
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,560
even complex brains of fte utilize these
things and are,

567
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,360
you know,
in the course of evolution,

568
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:47,380
we internalize these things,
have adapted them to our own,

569
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:52,381
like internal signaling processes.
So now we have the,

570
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,480
you know,
the neurological tools if you will,

571
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,970
to talk to the plants,
you know,

572
00:30:57,971 --> 00:31:02,971
they've always been talking to us.
Now we can actually have a conversation 

573
00:31:02,971 --> 00:31:05,170
and the ca you get into the conversation
and the conversation is,

574
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,440
you know,
uh,

575
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:09,010
you monkeys need to move to the next 
level.

576
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:14,011
You need to get more conscious of your 
place in nature,

577
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:19,321
our place in nature as a species.
A realize that we're not separate from 

578
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:19,321
it.

579
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:21,760
We're part of it.
And if it goes down,

580
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,990
we go down.
I mean,

581
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:25,420
there is no,
there is no escape.

582
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:29,740
There's no ticket out of here.
I'm not yet see any way and,

583
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:34,741
uh,
and the plants or the tools to 

584
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:34,741
understand this,
you know,

585
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:37,600
I mean,
there's good scientific studies now that

586
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:40,870
show that silicide button,
which is the one that's been studied,

587
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:46,380
can reliably induce a state that you 
might call a mystical experience.

588
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:50,440
I prefer to call it a transcendent 
experience,

589
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,840
but the,
you know,

590
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:56,220
the nugget of the experience that it can
elicit other,

591
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,030
the right experiences.
This is an understanding of a,

592
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,080
we are all one,
you know,

593
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:05,110
we're not separate.
That's the core of the,

594
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:10,111
I think the mystical insight that 
psychedelic spring about why should our 

595
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:14,821
brains even have evolve to have that 
kind of experience if it's not a way of,

596
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,470
you know,
kind of a,

597
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,510
I don't know,
uh,

598
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,260
being able to initiate that conversation
with,

599
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,030
uh,
with the rest of species.

600
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,650
I mean,
they're counting on us,

601
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:35,090
you know,
because never before we've civilization 

602
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,410
and humanity is impacted nature and 
adverse ways.

603
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,260
As long as we've been around,
as long as we've had fire,

604
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,320
you know,
fire back in the Paleolithic and even 

605
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,820
earlier was a tremendously,
not necessarily destructive force,

606
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,700
but it was a transformative force on 
ecosystems.

607
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,540
We didn't particularly use it in a 
conscious way.

608
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,750
We we used it in a way that that served 
our,

609
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:05,170
our purposes a,
but now with 7 billion people on the 

610
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:10,541
earth and counting and technologies that
no one ever imagined that we'd have at 

611
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:14,780
our fingertips.
What we do now really matters.

612
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,920
You know,
because we,

613
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,950
because before that nature,
the homeostatic mechanisms that tended 

614
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:25,010
to take nature,
keep nature in balance,

615
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:30,011
you know,
we could cause tremendous ecological 

616
00:33:30,011 --> 00:33:30,980
destruction and nature with eventually,
you know,

617
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:33,980
that would fade away in nature would 
come back into balance.

618
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:38,900
Now we're actually in danger of 
permanently screwing up those mechanisms

619
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:43,880
so we actually have to kind of 
consciously intervene or be conscious of

620
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:48,881
what we're doing because the 
consequences of what we do are just so 

621
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:49,730
much greater.
Does that make.

622
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,660
Oh,
it absolutely does.

623
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:56,661
It absolutely does.
I think there's another thing that we 

624
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,001
need to put into perspective is the 
relatively short amount of time that 

625
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:04,041
human beings have had access to the 
information that we have today and the,

626
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:10,190
the,
the terrible effects of propaganda and 

627
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,370
how long propaganda can stick.
You know,

628
00:34:11,371 --> 00:34:15,840
when we're talking about just the just 
say no era of the eighties,

629
00:34:15,841 --> 00:34:20,841
the Nancy Reagan nonsense.
I had Dr Carl Hart on recently who's a 

630
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,970
brilliant dive.
You aware of his work,

631
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,990
amazing work on,
uh,

632
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,170
addiction and,
and,

633
00:34:26,171 --> 00:34:31,171
and sort of educating people about the 
actual real reactions that the human 

634
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:35,691
body has to drugs.
But what he's talking about it was 

635
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:37,650
really interesting is like there has 
never been a drug free society,

636
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,340
nor would you want one.
You know,

637
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,950
it doesn't exist.
So this,

638
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:46,160
this idea is so stupid that it's been 
hammered into us this impossible ideal.

639
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:53,180
And it's,
it's because of the ability to 

640
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:53,970
communicate.
It's ironic that,

641
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:54,990
you know,
the,

642
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,440
the ability to communicate through mass 
amounts of people is so recent within 

643
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,400
the last few hundred years,
thousand years,

644
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:06,660
whatever it's been that we,
the impact of these things,

645
00:35:06,661 --> 00:35:10,170
although in our incredibly small,
finite lives,

646
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,320
seems like forever is a comparatively 
just a little tiny blip on the radar 

647
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:20,590
where,
where we've had this sort of cultural 

648
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,671
hiccup where we lost the script and the 
Internet seems to be what's resetting 

649
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,280
the,
the information.

650
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:28,710
And I think that's one of the reasons 
why marijuana,

651
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:32,070
besides the financial reason,
my marijuana has gained so much steam.

652
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,150
The,
the,

653
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,600
just the sheer overwhelming avalanche of
facts,

654
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:41,870
the of desks,
the ld 50 rate of 1500 pounds in 15 

655
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,550
minutes.
Like just the sheer absurdity of what it

656
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:47,340
takes to kill you.
And then the stats that come in.

657
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,460
I mean,
how many times can you see someone 

658
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:52,460
posted with the numbers?
People die by cigarettes,

659
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:52,460
uh,
numbers.

660
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,510
People don't buy prescription drugs.
The numbers of people don't buy alcohol,

661
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:59,511
the number of people.
And you just start looking at that and 

662
00:35:59,511 --> 00:35:59,511
then marijuana gets to the bottom.
Zero.

663
00:35:59,511 --> 00:35:59,640
Well,
what the fuck,

664
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,800
you know,
it's over and over and over and over 

665
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:04,800
again.
It's resetting.

666
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,300
This is strange propaganda,
but to people that have been alive 

667
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,330
through it,
it's indoctrination.

668
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:12,150
It's and how we've come to understand 
the world,

669
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:17,330
but the message is penetrating now.
It is now with all that cultural baggage

670
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:20,850
that that is,
that marijuana is loaded down with.

671
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:25,851
Finally,
the real message is coming through when 

672
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,851
people are exactly like you say 
beginning to wake up to it and compared 

673
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:31,950
to all the other recreational drugs that
we accept,

674
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,250
this one is benign and beneficial.

675
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,200
I've said that I think that in the 
future when people look back on this age

676
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:41,690
where people were being arrested in 
prison for marijuana,

677
00:36:41,691 --> 00:36:46,691
they're going to look back at the same 
way they used to look at at killing 

678
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:46,691
witches.
Yeah,

679
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:48,050
exactly.
It's really that ridiculous.

680
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:48,760
It's just,
it's so.

681
00:36:48,761 --> 00:36:53,761
It's such a a black mark on our,
our silly society and just an indication

682
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:57,440
of how disconnected we are.

683
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,610
This,
this concept of a drug free society,

684
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:05,611
as you say,
is totally absurd because you know 

685
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:06,510
we're.
We're made of drugs.

686
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,420
In fact,
we are drugs and uh,

687
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,020
you know,
uh,

688
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:16,070
our brains run on neurotransmitters and 
whether they're endogenously produced 

689
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:16,750
and we know,
for example,

690
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:21,751
that dmt is an endogenous 
neurotransmitter and that's a whole 

691
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:26,340
fascinating area of neuroscience now,
potential functions for Dmt,

692
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,100
uh,
you know,

693
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,110
are being found.
We know it's been there for a long time.

694
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,070
We've known it's endogenous,
but it's not so clear what the hell it's

695
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:40,071
doing in there.
Now we're beginning to get some 

696
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:40,071
indications that it really does have a 
function,

697
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:45,021
for example,
in places that you wouldn't expect 

698
00:37:45,021 --> 00:37:45,630
modulating the immune system.
For example.

699
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,990
All this stuff is emerging so,
you know,

700
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,840
uh,
I mean by any measure,

701
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:56,850
these internal chemicals are drugs.
They just happened to be drugs that we 

702
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:01,161
make ourselves.
We don't buy them from the local pot 

703
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:01,161
dealer or whatever.
So,

704
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,510
you know,
so the perceptions are,

705
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,880
are changing.
I think.

706
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:06,390
Yeah.

707
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,580
Three,
I think,

708
00:38:07,581 --> 00:38:08,720
um,
again,

709
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:12,130
I attribute the Internet and um,
some of the workload that uh,

710
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,700
rick strassman has done.
It's been pretty fascinating as well.

711
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:19,701
And the most recent work showing that 
DMT is actually produced in the pineal 

712
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:21,830
gland of of live rats,
which was always,

713
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:27,250
for whatever reason,
even though everyone knew dmt was a 

714
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,480
endogenous neurotransmitter and that 
human beings absolutely produced in the 

715
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:31,790
liver and the lungs and different parts 
of the body.

716
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,280
The pineal gland has always been 
ultimately incredibly fascinating 

717
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,610
because it literally is that third eye,
the seed of the soul,

718
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
and there was so much resistance to that
idea that this mystical chemical is 

719
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:52,261
actually produced by the third eye.
And I saw online like all this battling 

720
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:54,760
back and forth of,
well,

721
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:57,100
it's only anecdotal evidence that it's 
produced by now.

722
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,470
There's actual physical evidence.
There's know it's there.

723
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:05,570
We knew it had to be there,
all the enzymes to make it all the 

724
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:09,600
precursors to make it were there,
but nobody had actually nailed it down.

725
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:14,550
Now they've nailed it down.
So that's progress.

726
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:15,270
That's a step.

727
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,480
But that's the,
the,

728
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:21,481
the,
the resistance to the idea was very 

729
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:21,481
fascinating to me.
Like why,

730
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:24,430
why would anybody care whether or not it
was pretty.

731
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:29,450
I mean the body makes it for sure.
Like why is it such an issue that the 

732
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,360
pineal gland makes it,
but it is.

733
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,660
It is because that sort of opens up the 
door to eastern mysticism to all that 

734
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:41,100
traditional religious art that showed 
the glowing third eye and you know,

735
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:46,101
all these peaceful,
enlightened beings with a lit third 

736
00:39:46,101 --> 00:39:47,520
eyes,
like all of that is like,

737
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,420
oh well,
they probably knew something like,

738
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,690
oh,
there's something to it.

739
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,480
They did know a thing.
Well,

740
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,660
they knew quite a bit.
Right?

741
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:59,770
Because the other thing is the Egyptian 
artwork that so clearly resembles the 

742
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:05,331
pineal gland and the actual cross 
section of the human brain and there's.

743
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,220
There's so much of that in ancient 
civilizations,

744
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:13,221
in ancient cultures.
It just makes you really try to piece 

745
00:40:13,221 --> 00:40:13,230
together like,
when did we lose all this?

746
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:16,380
Like what have we figured that out?
When,

747
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:19,030
when did all that sort of slip away,
it gets lost.

748
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,800
I mean,
obviously it's not lost.

749
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,730
We're now rediscovering it.
It was just,

750
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,020
it was esoteric,
you know,

751
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:29,190
it was esoteric knowledge for a long 
time.

752
00:40:29,191 --> 00:40:34,191
Now it's becoming less esoteric.
More people are becoming aware of what 

753
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:39,831
the ancients knew,
what the visionaries of the mystics 

754
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:41,850
always knew.
This is no longer hidden knowledge,

755
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:45,750
you know,
it's becoming more accessible and that's

756
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:50,780
partly the effect of the Internet and 
partly the effect of a lot of very smart

757
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:54,080
people obsessing over this,
you know,

758
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,780
and sharing what they're finding out.
So again,

759
00:40:57,781 --> 00:40:59,010
this is a,
I think,

760
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,040
part of the general raising of 
consciousness in this area that's going 

761
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,350
on now.

762
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,910
Amber Lyon,
who's a,

763
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,200
she was a reporter for CNN and a sort of
lost their faith in mainstream news when

764
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:17,891
she did a piece on Bahrain and it got a 
redacted and edited and turned into like

765
00:41:18,051 --> 00:41:19,570
a tourist piece and she,
you know,

766
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,470
she left CNN.
It was this huge thing.

767
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,990
She was really like trying to figure out
what to do with their life.

768
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,270
And uh,
I,

769
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:28,250
I suggested psychedelic drugs.
So she goes down to Peru,

770
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,770
takes like,
just jumps on a plane,

771
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:32,990
like literally grabs what clothes she 
had in her,

772
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,450
jumps on a plane,
goes to Peru,

773
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:40,570
take seven.
A long Iowasca trips completely changes 

774
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,110
their life,
goes on a year round journey,

775
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:47,410
your long journey to discover various 
psychedelic medicines and in different 

776
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,580
indigenous cultures goes to Thailand and
does mushrooms,

777
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,860
goes to Mexico,
just does all that.

778
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:56,030
Now she's writing or making this website
called reset me.

779
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,870
She's dedicated her life to psychedelics
within one year,

780
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:04,990
one crazy transformative trip and it's 
people like her and people like you and 

781
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:11,531
people like you that are putting this 
information out and starting this sort 

782
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:17,231
of like undeniable tide is shifting,
is undeniable shifting,

783
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:17,900
right?

784
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,270
Right.
Psychedelics and neurotransmitters aside

785
00:42:21,271 --> 00:42:26,271
because people expect something big when
they take these things and people are 

786
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,520
rightly a little apprehensive.
I mean it will change your life if you 

787
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,480
take these plants,
but if you want to have a transformative

788
00:42:33,481 --> 00:42:36,720
experience with plants and you're leery 
of psychedelics,

789
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,800
try going on a an all plant based diet 
for a little while.

790
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:44,550
Change your intestinal bacteria and way 
you'll.

791
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,490
You'll have this sense of levity,
lightness.

792
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,790
It will change the way you think about 
yourself,

793
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:56,060
not as quickly as a psychedelic plant 
experience and it takes discipline or 

794
00:42:56,191 --> 00:42:57,990
try a fast.
I mean,

795
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,860
there are ways to have these,
these transformative experiences without

796
00:43:01,861 --> 00:43:03,600
drugs,
without plants,

797
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:04,260
but it's just

798
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:09,630
the only transformative experience that 
I've ever experienced from dealing with 

799
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,771
people that have gone in a completely 
transforming their life in a completely 

800
00:43:13,771 --> 00:43:17,161
plant based diet is they can never shut 
the fuck up about the fact that they're 

801
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:17,161
on a plant based.

802
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,760
Well,
you have to,

803
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:23,761
you over the head with it.
It's a hard lifestyle to maintain.

804
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,730
Yeah.
Um,

805
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,470
and in,
in light of,

806
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:27,990
of the

807
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:33,290
new information that's been discovered 
over the past decade or so about the 

808
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:37,440
intelligence of plants,
about plants' ability to calculate their

809
00:43:37,441 --> 00:43:39,060
ability to recognize,
um,

810
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,540
uh,
perhaps even a memory,

811
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:43,210
their,
their,

812
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,380
their ability to recognize dangers,
their ability to adapt.

813
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,650
There's a consciousness in plants that 
is undeniable and I think very 

814
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,290
misunderstood or not understood.
That's not a word,

815
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,360
but we're,
we're ignorant to it.

816
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:02,630
And that's one of the problems that I 
have with people that push the plant 

817
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,030
based diet.
Like I don't think.

818
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,150
I think life eats life and I think it 
always has.

819
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,400
And I think,
you know,

820
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:12,410
you can get to the very bottom of the 
Karma chain where you're,

821
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:17,510
you know,
you're a fun guy and you're living off 

822
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,431
of poop and you know,
basically things that things are thrown 

823
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:20,460
away or you can be a tiger,
you know,

824
00:44:20,461 --> 00:44:24,120
and they're all beautiful.
The whole system is crazy and beautiful.

825
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,980
And the only reason why we exist at all 
is that a fucking star had a die.

826
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,780
You know what I mean?
The whole thing is death.

827
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:36,650
But we're so obsessed with this idea of 
eating only plants or you know,

828
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:40,710
eating,
being on a plant based Diet connects you

829
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:45,711
more to nature.
I've become a hunter over the last year 

830
00:44:45,711 --> 00:44:46,200
and a half and I,
I couldn't disagree more.

831
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:51,710
One of the reasons being is that hunting
is a very psychedelic experience and 

832
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,340
weird way that I never would have 
believed.

833
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,620
Um,
the first time I ever went deer hunting 

834
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:58,860
and shot a deer and then wound up eating
it.

835
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:03,360
There's a weird connection that you have
with nature and with that animal.

836
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:08,361
When you do that,
especially if you do it and what's 

837
00:45:08,361 --> 00:45:10,710
termed a fair chase environment,
you go out into the actual woods,

838
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,540
you deal with an animal,
most likely,

839
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:17,541
that animal right there,
it never even seen a human being before 

840
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:18,420
I shot it.
And then we're eating it.

841
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,770
That deer had,
right?

842
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:21,750
They're not the alien,
the alien,

843
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,800
that motherfucker he's talking to you.
But I think that there's,

844
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,500
there's life in everything and there's 
most likely some form of a consciousness

845
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:36,890
in all life.
And,

846
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:37,230
um,

847
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,780
and I think brains are overrated.
You know,

848
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,640
nervous systems are overrated in a 
certain sense.

849
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:43,300
You could say,
well,

850
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,340
how could a plant be intelligent?
It's,

851
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:47,830
it doesn't have a nervous system.
It doesn't have a brain,

852
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,400
but it clearly displays intelligence.
And in fact,

853
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:57,490
speaking of that,
speaking of your hunting and experience,

854
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,620
you know,
the author Michael Pollan,

855
00:45:59,621 --> 00:46:00,720
right?
Uh,

856
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,090
he,
he had a great essay and I think the New

857
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,850
Yorker recently about plants 
intelligence,

858
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,460
that if you haven't read it,
it's worth reading.

859
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:15,340
But I also love his chapter in the 
Omnivore's dilemma,

860
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,420
which is,
uh,

861
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:20,350
which is subtitled the natural history 
of four meals.

862
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,920
And one of the meals is a meat meal 
where he,

863
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,570
where he wants to create a meal,
but he wants to do it.

864
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,780
He wants to put himself in the shoes of 
100 gatherer,

865
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,620
so he wants to gather all wild foods,
plant foods,

866
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:41,830
obviously mushrooms,
pine nuts and this sort of thing.

867
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:46,780
But he also wants to hunt down a bore,
I think it was,

868
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:50,170
and kill it and strip it,
skin it,

869
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,950
cut it up and eat it and have that 
experience.

870
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:58,951
And I think that what you say is totally
legitimate if you're gonna eat meat,

871
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:04,291
it's important that people realize where
that an animal died so that you could 

872
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:08,761
have that meal and native Americans,
indigenous people have always recognized

873
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:13,120
this because they are up against it.
So,

874
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,420
you know,
they'll always think the animal for what

875
00:47:16,421 --> 00:47:17,130
their kid,
aiden.

876
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:18,190
And that's,
uh,

877
00:47:18,191 --> 00:47:23,191
that's really important.
And that's something that we should try 

878
00:47:23,191 --> 00:47:24,530
to integrate into everything.
Why not thank the plants too.

879
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,470
Thank you.
Know,

880
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:30,570
thank everything we wouldn't be here if 
we weren't sustained this web of life.

881
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:35,710
So why are we being so disrespectful to 
it?

882
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,750
I mean,
I guess that's the crux of the question,

883
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:38,510
will we

884
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:42,130
can't really feel what we're doing to 
this earth in and we,

885
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:47,150
we have this diffusion of responsibility
thing got me to the grocery store and 

886
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:51,111
wrapped in plastic.
You have no notion where it actually 

887
00:47:51,111 --> 00:47:51,400
came from.
Yeah.

888
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:55,510
I've made a commitment this year to live
entirely off of a game.

889
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:58,690
Meat of wild game,
all wild to nothing that,

890
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,300
you know,
no pendant animals.

891
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:06,301
They just wind up shooting the hand that
I was telling you guys about before the 

892
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:06,640
show smoking ham.
That's a pig.

893
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:11,641
I killed a on this ranch to hone ranch 
and they actually have to have hunters 

894
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:17,110
come in because these,
these are invasive species,

895
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:20,110
these wild pigs and they will destroy 
everything.

896
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:25,090
They deer fawns,
they grounding a ground nesting birds.

897
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:26,380
They eat their eggs.
I mean they're,

898
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:31,470
they're unbelievably devastating to the 
environments that they,

899
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:33,280
uh,
aren't naturally a part of.

900
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:38,370
Right?
So there's a role for us as stewards of 

901
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:38,910
the environment,
these,

902
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,570
these wild boar,
sir,

903
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,850
unless you say they're devastating 
ecosystems.

904
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:45,430
I don't know in California,
but Hawaii,

905
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:50,320
this is their biggest problem and it's 
destroying ecosystems in Hawaii.

906
00:48:50,321 --> 00:48:52,810
So there is a role for us to step in and
say,

907
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:53,830
well,
you know,

908
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,860
we're going to kind of exert some 
control here and control that population

909
00:48:58,931 --> 00:49:02,920
because they didn't originate in Hawaii.
They are invasive species,

910
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:07,921
as you say,
from your agents need for some 

911
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:07,921
regulation.

912
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:08,190
Well,
there's an issue right now in San Jose,

913
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,830
San Jose,
they've started to make,

914
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,090
make their way into suburbs and they're 
destroying people's lawns and uh,

915
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,200
you know,
they'll,

916
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,630
they'll,
they'll have children.

917
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:20,910
Do you fucking shit.

918
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:22,540
Yeah.
Um,

919
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,150
it's,
it,

920
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:27,280
it is a weird connection.
The connection that,

921
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:28,720
uh,
that we have to,

922
00:49:28,721 --> 00:49:29,350
uh,
to,

923
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,440
to life itself and the,
our thoughts when we talk about native 

924
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,211
Americans,
like almost immediately we think of the 

925
00:49:39,211 --> 00:49:42,490
spiritual connection that native 
Americans had to the land,

926
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:47,491
the deep respect that they had for the 
animals that they killed in the fact 

927
00:49:47,491 --> 00:49:48,760
that they would use every single piece 
of that animal.

928
00:49:48,761 --> 00:49:53,270
They'd use the hide to make the a roof 
or close they would use Sydney,

929
00:49:53,271 --> 00:49:54,920
you for,
for uh,

930
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,040
for strings,
for their bows and arrows.

931
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:59,680
The,
they literally used every part tooth,

932
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:01,330
bone,
nail flesh.

933
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,240
They ate them and they worship these 
animals,

934
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,740
you know,
and it was,

935
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:11,040
it was a deep respect.
It was an inexorable part of the 

936
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:14,430
relationship to nature itself.
Yeah.

937
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:20,030
I really hear you on this.
I grew up in the woods of Michigan mile 

938
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:23,820
outside of a town of 150 people and my 
uncle is a hunter and a taxidermist,

939
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:29,090
but hunting for him as a spiritual quest
and experience and you feel the pain of 

940
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:33,200
the animal you kill and utilizing all 
aspects of it.

941
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:38,620
I'm not,
I'm not opposed to eating meat by any 

942
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,751
means.
I'm just saying that an Alpine plant 

943
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:42,440
diet when when you do it properly can 
transform consciousness.

944
00:50:42,441 --> 00:50:44,240
It's a,
it's a strange thing,

945
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,720
but going on an all meat diet and eating
that conscious,

946
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:50,590
conscious eating can change conscious,
conscious,

947
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,560
subconscious everything,
right?

948
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,830
Every design of institutions,
of,

949
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,080
of the Internet,
of our experiences.

950
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,950
Yeah.
Other people,

951
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,070
when you were talking about earlier 
about brains being overrated,

952
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:10,550
one of the things that I've really,
it's been inescapable for me over the 

953
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,720
last few years or so is this idea that 
we're the caterpillars that are giving 

954
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,651
birth to the moth and that our whole 
screwy system and our whole,

955
00:51:22,981 --> 00:51:27,981
you know,
are issues with ego problems and 

956
00:51:27,981 --> 00:51:30,171
materialism might be because we're just 
sort of a transitionary stage to this 

957
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:36,080
symbiotic relationship that we have with
technology and then we're going to give 

958
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,770
birth.
There's some artificial thing that 

959
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:41,160
doesn't carry the burdens of natural 
selection that doesn't carry the burdens

960
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:46,400
of primitive instincts,
the needs or survive all these animal 

961
00:51:46,651 --> 00:51:50,370
reward systems that were built into us 
from the time that we were monkeys.

962
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:52,870
Perhaps it doesn't sound like a very 
nice existence.

963
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:58,210
Sound like a nice existence,
but I'm not sure about that.

964
00:51:58,501 --> 00:52:01,260
This is why bounce it around because I 
don't know.

965
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,330
I don't know if it's better.
I mean the idea is that,

966
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,470
well,
if I'm not a person,

967
00:52:07,471 --> 00:52:11,220
well I'm fucked.
But is that the ego hanging onto that?

968
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:16,430
I mean,
is it is some sort of hyper intelligent 

969
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:20,700
artificial life that's capable of living
completely,

970
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:25,890
uh,
completely self sustaining existence 

971
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,371
where you're totally solar powered all 
garbage or any waste product whatsoever.

972
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,810
It's factored immediately into the 
equation instead of put off like nuclear

973
00:52:33,811 --> 00:52:36,060
waste where they just dig a fucking hole
and Oh,

974
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,030
we'll figure that out later.
That's madness.

975
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:44,031
To me,
the nuclear waste issue is one of the 

976
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:45,660
most maddening and insane issues ever 
where they take these things,

977
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:49,230
they build holes and then they put it in
there and then they seal it up.

978
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,480
Like,
what do you look a little kid like,

979
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:56,540
are you fucking crazy?
That's like what a little kid would do 

980
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:56,540
when they have to clean their room.
They lift up the carpet,

981
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,230
they sweep it under the,
they put the carpet down.

982
00:52:58,231 --> 00:53:00,270
It's a childish way of approaching an 
issue.

983
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,120
Instead of having a completely holistic 
approach to this,

984
00:53:04,121 --> 00:53:05,520
this thing like,
okay,

985
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,950
are we going to build this stuff?
If we are going to build this stuff,

986
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,750
what are we going to do about the toxic 
waste?

987
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,790
Okay,
well let's factor that in before we move

988
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:16,791
forward.
And then spend an extra few decades 

989
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:19,551
trying to figure out what to do with 
that shit and then maybe come up with a 

990
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:20,610
solution before you ever moved forward.
But we don't do that.

991
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:25,730
We have this weird thing that we just 
sort of put it off and we child 

992
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:26,430
companies have quarterly

993
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:31,430
reporting requirements.
If we just changed the financial 

994
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,581
reporting structure just one year,
a five year instead of this short term 

995
00:53:34,581 --> 00:53:36,810
thinking,
well solar panels are cheaper.

996
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,680
At least this is what has to be factored
into corporate planning,

997
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:47,811
as you say,
because in the operations have gotten a 

998
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:50,721
free ride for too long because they'd 
never pay the environmental consequences

999
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:53,010
of what they do,
you know?

1000
00:53:53,011 --> 00:53:58,011
And we have to change that where they 
have to be held accountable and 

1001
00:53:58,011 --> 00:53:59,250
responsible for the environmental 
impact.

1002
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,700
It's not just that you pay $200 for an 
iphone,

1003
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,520
you know,
you pay $200 for an iphone,

1004
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:10,550
but it cost $2,000
to deal with the environmental impact of

1005
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:18,550
the toxic waste.
That economic equation has got to 

1006
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:21,570
change.
And that's one of the biggest challenges

1007
00:54:21,571 --> 00:54:25,350
because it's a huge.
It's a huge challenge to capitalism.

1008
00:54:25,351 --> 00:54:27,330
It's,
it's laying down the gauntlet and say,

1009
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:28,560
look guys,
okay,

1010
00:54:28,561 --> 00:54:30,480
you can make money,
but let's make,

1011
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:34,860
let's look at the bottom line in the 
realistic way and you're making all this

1012
00:54:34,861 --> 00:54:39,861
profit,
but what are you costing the taxpayers 

1013
00:54:39,861 --> 00:54:42,840
and the rest of society for your profit 
making activities?

1014
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,730
How about a little payback here?
You know,

1015
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,120
how about,
you know,

1016
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:52,160
some fun,
some way to compensate for the damage 

1017
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,490
that,
that corporations do.

1018
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:54,630
And that's,
that's the,

1019
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,420
that's the biggest threat that I can see
right now.

1020
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:01,980
The corporations want to own everything.
They want to corporatize everything.

1021
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:06,981
And nature is just another commodity as 
they see it to be owned and exploited.

1022
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:13,340
And uh,
that's the perception that's got to 

1023
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:13,860
change.
And maybe one way to do it this to,

1024
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,690
you know,
I,

1025
00:55:14,691 --> 00:55:19,691
I think speaking of hearts and minds,
I think if you can get in there are 

1026
00:55:19,801 --> 00:55:22,560
ethical capitalists out there,
you know,

1027
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:27,930
chances are they're partly ethical 
because they took psychedelics at some 

1028
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:28,580
point.
I mean,

1029
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,200
Steve Jobs and people like that,
you know,

1030
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:33,120
and um,
we could name others.

1031
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,190
So,
you know,

1032
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:40,440
psychedelics are teaching tools to help 
people kind of understand their,

1033
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,260
their place,
their responsibilities,

1034
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,270
and uh,
uh,

1035
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,380
you know,
we have to,

1036
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,700
again,
that's part of this.

1037
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:53,120
It's not that we can't innovate,
we just have to be realistic about the 

1038
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:57,141
impact that our actions are having.
We also have this issue with 

1039
00:55:57,141 --> 00:55:59,040
incorporations having survival instincts
and corporations.

1040
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,940
This unlimited growth paradigm.
This is impossible,

1041
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:08,050
right?
Like what we're talking about with like 

1042
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:08,050
laptops that.
Can we just stop right here?

1043
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:08,520
No,
we can't.

1044
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,820
It's impossible.
And we also can't stop as far as profit.

1045
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:16,950
Well,
we made this much this quarter and this 

1046
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:16,950
quarter we showed a 25 percent growth.
Excellent.

1047
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:21,141
Let's keep moving on by 2075,
we should have all the money in the 

1048
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:21,141
world.
I mean,

1049
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:24,250
that's really what every corporation.
And isn't this

1050
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,570
what's happening?
Yes it is.

1051
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:27,390
It's madness,
right?

1052
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:28,840
Got,
what is it?

1053
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:33,841
Ninety five percent of the wealth 
concentrated in the one percent and the 

1054
00:56:33,841 --> 00:56:35,620
rest of us are,
you know,

1055
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:40,710
the rest of us is,
it's quickly evolving into a third world

1056
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:42,500
situation and,
and that,

1057
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,640
that is economic slavery in a sense.
I mean people do what they have to do 

1058
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:49,480
because they don't have a choice.
Their,

1059
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:53,410
you know,
their economic activity,

1060
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:56,130
they're priorities are dictated by 
corporations.

1061
00:56:56,170 --> 00:57:01,170
This idea that profit is the only thing 
that a corporation should be concerned 

1062
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:05,290
with.
We've got to evolve beyond that.

1063
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:09,790
Sustainability is more important.
Uh,

1064
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:15,570
helping people's lives be better as more
important than profits.

1065
00:57:15,731 --> 00:57:20,731
I mean sure profits,
but that should be down several notches 

1066
00:57:20,731 --> 00:57:21,540
I think,
on the,

1067
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,090
on the totem pole in terms of what they 
identify as

1068
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,340
important.
I think it should be like food.

1069
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:32,640
I think profit should be like food in 
that you can't eat poison and that if 

1070
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:36,520
you're eating something and look,
we have all these calories.

1071
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:36,880
Yeah,
yeah,

1072
00:57:36,881 --> 00:57:38,560
yeah.
But it's fucking killing you,

1073
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:40,240
right?
You understand that you can't eat this.

1074
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,370
This is bad for you.
Like don't like this,

1075
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:44,180
but it's got a thousand calories,
you know,

1076
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:45,240
I need calories to where,
no,

1077
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:45,400
no,
no,

1078
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:47,800
you don't need those calories.
That's poison.

1079
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:53,040
And,
and essentially the idea of profit is 

1080
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,870
profit overall and profit over humanity.
You know,

1081
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,880
the idea of financial,
financial gain over human suffering like

1082
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:05,440
that somehow or another it balances out 
is just like eating poison.

1083
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,850
I mean,
it really is.

1084
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,350
There should be no profit at all when 
this human suffering.

1085
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:13,840
It should be one of those things with.
It's factored in,

1086
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:16,270
oh we can't eat this.
It's poisoned for humanity,

1087
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:16,800
right?
Yeah.

1088
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,060
The corporation in the u s if it does 
not maximize profit,

1089
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:22,790
can be sued by its shareholders.
That's the law.

1090
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:26,390
They have a legal responsibility to 
maximize profit.

1091
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:31,670
That's so crazy.
And so we have to change the laws that 

1092
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:31,670
shareholders

1093
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:35,780
until the shareholders start demanding 
that they actually act responsibly.

1094
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,870
So that's.
I don't know how that works,

1095
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:43,900
but you know,
if the shareholders achieve a higher 

1096
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:48,431
level of consciousness,
maybe they can influence the way the 

1097
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:48,431
corporate.

1098
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:51,850
It was a NASA funded study looking at 
collapse of civilizations and one of the

1099
00:58:51,851 --> 00:58:56,851
major factors is the discrepancy in 
wealth that the wealthy people are using

1100
00:58:57,281 --> 00:59:02,281
up the resources and they're insulated 
from the effects and then it gets to a 

1101
00:59:02,281 --> 00:59:06,631
point where the people making decisions 
haven't been thinking about the the the 

1102
00:59:06,631 --> 00:59:09,700
consequences and the alternatives and 
it's.

1103
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:11,860
It's something's gotta change.

1104
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:13,160
Yeah,
that's a.

1105
00:59:13,161 --> 00:59:18,161
That was a fascinating and very 
terrifying report because this is not 

1106
00:59:18,161 --> 00:59:23,051
someone with any financial interest in 
relaying this message is not something 

1107
00:59:23,051 --> 00:59:25,340
that someone that's selling a solution,
they're just looking at all the data and

1108
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:27,770
go and look.
If you just follow these trends,

1109
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,270
this is where it goes.
No,

1110
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:32,980
there's no,
no indication whatsoever that it's going

1111
00:59:32,981 --> 00:59:34,420
to slow down.
This is,

1112
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,640
this is where we're going.
We have to figure this out before we hit

1113
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:38,150
this wall.

1114
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,320
[inaudible],
when I was an Undergrad,

1115
00:59:40,321 --> 00:59:44,580
I was in business school until I took 
five grams of siliciden mushrooms.

1116
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:49,581
Today I grew in my dormitory closet at 
the urging of Terence Mckenna's book.

1117
00:59:49,751 --> 00:59:53,940
See old generic method under buying 
civilization.

1118
00:59:53,941 --> 00:59:57,900
One chart at a time of civilization.
Radical,

1119
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:03,170
but I realized that I was fighting a 
losing battle if I wasn't speaking the 

1120
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:07,521
same language of making some profit of 
appealing to people's business 

1121
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:08,020
interests.
I.

1122
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:13,250
It was a long process.
I wanted to get out of this culture and 

1123
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:18,171
ended up in China teaching English and 
I've spent most of the last 10 years in 

1124
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:20,610
China.
I'm like a third Chinese now basically,

1125
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:25,790
and I became comfortable analyzing the 
situation I was in meeting people on 

1126
01:00:27,631 --> 01:00:32,631
their level because I can't.
One thing being in China teaches you is 

1127
01:00:32,631 --> 01:00:36,891
to be constructive with people to come 
at an issue from how they're thinking 

1128
01:00:36,931 --> 01:00:37,380
about it.

1129
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:42,710
So I began that.
Why is that people don't want to lose 

1130
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:43,410
face,
so it's a,

1131
01:00:43,411 --> 01:00:48,411
it's a top down culture so you 
understand the priorities of a leader 

1132
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,880
and they have some enlightened 
interests.

1133
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:55,881
They have their self interests as well,
and you appeal to their better image of 

1134
01:00:55,881 --> 01:01:00,231
themselves.
What's possible a win win situation 

1135
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:04,220
where,
so I think of myself now as a kind of 

1136
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,580
economic therapist.
I talked to corporations,

1137
01:01:05,581 --> 01:01:08,850
I talked to ngos,
the campaigning organizations,

1138
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:12,150
and I try to help people find a balance.
What is,

1139
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:17,180
what are the win win situation,
so the last six years I've been working 

1140
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:21,441
with the global sustainability standards
like the forest stewardship council and 

1141
01:01:21,451 --> 01:01:26,451
the Marine Stewardship Council and the 
ESC is modeled on these organizations 

1142
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:31,020
that you talk with enough stakeholders 
and you build consensus through dialogue

1143
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,440
and you have a transparent process that 
appeals to companies that appeals to 

1144
01:01:36,871 --> 01:01:40,500
regulators,
so take Mcdonald's for example,

1145
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:45,770
they realized that they were catching 
too much fish from the ocean and it 

1146
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:49,191
wasn't sustainable,
so they now all Mcdonald's fish 

1147
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:50,670
sandwiches are marine stewardship 
council certified,

1148
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:55,970
which means they can sell fish 
sandwiches into eternity as long as the 

1149
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,240
oceans are a viable for life.

1150
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:02,510
Or Kimberly Clark was cutting down the 
rain forests and cutting down the 

1151
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:06,891
arboreal forest in Canada.
Now all of their paper products are 

1152
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:10,101
going to be FSC certified.
An FSC certifies 15 percent of the 

1153
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:14,571
standing forest of the world,
which means that people have a fair 

1154
01:02:14,571 --> 01:02:14,820
share.
This worship reserves,

1155
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:19,170
stewardship I think is really important.
It's an important word.

1156
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,180
Gotten to be reintroduced

1157
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:26,180
into corporate thinking in corporate 
planning as opposed to profits.

1158
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:30,060
I mean,
we all have a stake in survival,

1159
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:35,450
not everybody has a stake in profits to 
the shareholders have a stake in 

1160
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:39,201
profits,
but there's no profits if we don't 

1161
01:02:39,201 --> 01:02:40,950
survive,
if this whole shooting match collapses.

1162
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:45,100
So the concept of stewardship and I 
think that is,

1163
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:50,190
is really important to get that message 
out and that's what people like Josh or 

1164
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:54,690
trying to do.
And I think psychedelics have a role to 

1165
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:56,700
play absolutely.
In educating,

1166
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,410
you know,
uh,

1167
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,240
I mean,
it's interesting the,

1168
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,750
you know,
we can't,

1169
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:08,870
it's going to be awhile.
I think before Iowasca gets integrated 

1170
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:12,630
in this country in a way,
for example,

1171
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,590
in therapy and in biomedicine,
it's not gonna happen,

1172
01:03:16,591 --> 01:03:21,591
but what you do see happening are the 
centers that are growing up and right 

1173
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:26,361
now it's in South America and Josh and 
Ethno Botanical Stewardship Council are 

1174
01:03:27,151 --> 01:03:32,151
trying to develop standards for these 
organizations so that,

1175
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,890
you know,
they're committed to a certain ethical,

1176
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:40,190
a set of standards,
safety and quality of their,

1177
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,120
of their brew and so on.

1178
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:47,120
But I can envision a time not too far in
the future where if a person,

1179
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:53,830
you know,
you can go to South America and if you 

1180
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,690
have issues,
if you have sickness,

1181
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:56,700
addiction or whatever,
you could get treatment,

1182
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:01,110
but even more importantly,
you can just get an education,

1183
01:04:01,111 --> 01:04:03,780
you can just get a,
you can,

1184
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:08,970
you can go there for purposes of 
spiritual discovery and self discovery 

1185
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,970
and all that.
Once you have that infrastructure,

1186
01:04:11,971 --> 01:04:14,730
which is growing,
then it partly becomes,

1187
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:19,760
you know,
we need to get people in positions of 

1188
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,380
power,
corporate ceos,

1189
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:27,381
other government leaders and so on,
to go and have these experience.

1190
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,470
That's the big one,
right?

1191
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:29,280
We've,
yeah,

1192
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:33,240
I mean you can't hold them in a headlock
and force them to drink IOWASCA.

1193
01:04:33,241 --> 01:04:34,350
Although I'd like to

1194
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:39,860
a catalyst for creativity.
Take your marketing team to South 

1195
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:42,530
America and have a ceremony together,
rebrand your company.

1196
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,410
Exactly.
Increase your profits in the process and

1197
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,140
the benefits to people.
That's people.

1198
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:50,600
That's where the economic,
that's where the model comes in.

1199
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:55,630
People have a negative reaction to that.
And I know this personally firsthand 

1200
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:55,800
because,
uh,

1201
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,340
I have a business on it,
on a.com

1202
01:04:58,341 --> 01:05:03,341
is a company we sell exercise equipment 
and supplements and healthy foods.

1203
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:09,870
And one of the ways that on it was 
created was a,

1204
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,000
my partner Aubrey and I talking about it
and Aubrey going to South America,

1205
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:18,070
doing Iowasca and then having these 
visions about his business.

1206
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:23,220
And when you talked about that,
he was met with so much criticism.

1207
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:25,210
So many people were like,
ah,

1208
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:28,360
you're down there doing Iowasca thinking
about your business.

1209
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:30,040
Oh,
that's so gross.

1210
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,300
Oh,
that's so based.

1211
01:05:31,301 --> 01:05:33,070
That's so egocentric.
That,

1212
01:05:33,071 --> 01:05:34,900
so the anti,
you know,

1213
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:36,670
the,
the message of the plant.

1214
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:41,970
But it's creativity and creativity.
It manifests itself in a million 

1215
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:47,581
different ways.
And it is the idea of business equals 

1216
01:05:47,581 --> 01:05:51,780
evil really has to get,
we have to get past that because we all 

1217
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:52,080
exchange,
you know,

1218
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:54,400
it's not evil.
If some guy could fix your car,

1219
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:56,440
it's not evil.
If someone can fix your,

1220
01:05:56,441 --> 01:05:57,070
your,
uh,

1221
01:05:57,071 --> 01:06:00,610
your refrigerator so you can store food.
All those things are businesses

1222
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,710
not evil.
If you buy fair trade,

1223
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:07,330
coffee promotes biodiversity and farmers
can send their kids to school,

1224
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,010
go to hell.
So it is.

1225
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:14,011
It's when,
when it's possible to develop these 

1226
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:15,630
economic models.
So I totally disagree with your,

1227
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,560
your partners,
critics.

1228
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:21,970
Your partner is exactly right on and 
it's okay.

1229
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:24,370
He,
with his background,

1230
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:29,430
I assume it's a,
he goes to South America and he already 

1231
01:06:29,651 --> 01:06:31,390
has the mindset,
right?

1232
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:36,800
Then Iowasca is a way to sort of flesh 
out the vision if you were.

1233
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:38,470
I mean,
he,

1234
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:41,530
he went there to learn something and boy
to Dillard's someplace.

1235
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:46,020
Clearly he went through a bunch of other
things about his life will,

1236
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:50,830
you've got to get the personal shit,
clear family history,

1237
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:55,890
open up that bullshit folder,
get hit over the head.

1238
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,530
None of us here has done that 
completely.

1239
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:02,150
I mean at some point the process.
Yeah,

1240
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:03,490
no,
no doubt about it.

1241
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,380
You know,
um,

1242
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:09,660
uh,
I got a tank session scheduled for 

1243
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:10,610
tonight on some little workout.
Um,

1244
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:11,550
the,
uh,

1245
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:16,600
the,
the word ethical company or the 

1246
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,690
expression ethical company I think is a,
is a big one.

1247
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:24,930
And I think that this,
this idea of the psychedelic experience 

1248
01:07:25,031 --> 01:07:27,640
for those who haven't experienced it or 
for those who,

1249
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,100
oh,
I dropped acid in college,

1250
01:07:30,101 --> 01:07:35,101
but I'm past that now.
I've got a 401k in a mortgage and 

1251
01:07:35,101 --> 01:07:36,870
college bills for my kids and I have a 
lot of.

1252
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:43,320
Yeah.
But that's an excuse for not wanting to 

1253
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:43,320
confront it.
That's just,

1254
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,560
that's just self self delusion.
Really.

1255
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:46,910
Nobody's ever passed.

1256
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:47,770
No.
No one ever,

1257
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,950
ever.
If you're a human being and you have,

1258
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:54,570
you're a constant sort of soup of 
chemicals,

1259
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,700
neurotransmitters,
adrenaline,

1260
01:07:56,701 --> 01:08:01,701
hormones,
all these different things are going on 

1261
01:08:01,701 --> 01:08:03,571
and you're trying to maintain balances 
and keep everything aligned and then 

1262
01:08:03,571 --> 01:08:05,460
keep the pattern of thought in a good 
place.

1263
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:10,461
So that maintains everything as well.
I think that to these people that are 

1264
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:12,600
perpetrating a lot of the issues that we
have,

1265
01:08:12,601 --> 01:08:17,601
whether it's the head of bp or you know,
it takes some guy wants to frack and 

1266
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,430
say,
before you do that,

1267
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:22,700
do this first.
And then let's talk,

1268
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:27,760
you know,
like confronted with your own mortality 

1269
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:27,760
should almost be mandatory.
I mean,

1270
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,870
you should show that you went before.
You start fracking,

1271
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:35,050
you should show that you have a degree 
that you understand the actual physical 

1272
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:38,810
process of removing these chemicals.
You should understand,

1273
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:43,811
you know,
whatever energy extraction degrees you 

1274
01:08:43,811 --> 01:08:44,750
have to have in whatever science is that
pertain to that,

1275
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:47,870
but you should also have psychedelic 
trips under your belt.

1276
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:49,010
Like you'd say,
well,

1277
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:49,840
you know,
here,

1278
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,260
uh,
I seen your documentation.

1279
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:54,140
You've gone through your five grams and 
what did you get out of that?

1280
01:08:55,110 --> 01:09:00,110
You know what I mean?
Like it should be one of those things 

1281
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:00,110
where it's reviewed,
like,

1282
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:00,110
okay,
you haven't,

1283
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:05,980
okay,
what you've gotten off your list before 

1284
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:10,091
you proceed.
It shouldn't be like a presidential 

1285
01:09:10,091 --> 01:09:10,820
council for psychological fitness.
And they,

1286
01:09:10,821 --> 01:09:12,140
they sit you down,
they go,

1287
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:15,550
you don't have any psychedelic 
experiences on your resume.

1288
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:16,820
Ready the brain now?
Yeah.

1289
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:20,250
What are you doing?
Opening up the fucking company that digs

1290
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:22,670
holes in the ground and you don't have 
any psychedelic experiences.

1291
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:26,600
That's a recipe for disaster.
So you're missing a key component.

1292
01:09:26,601 --> 01:09:31,601
You're,
you're missing this connection to the 

1293
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:33,311
mother Earth via some unfathomable bowl 
experience that literally is impossible 

1294
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:38,300
to describe [inaudible].
So you're missing that part.

1295
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:40,400
So go get that and then come back.

1296
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:43,190
Then we'll talk about your business.
Yes.

1297
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:47,470
Are People in the Department of Defense 
or the veterans affairs that are dealing

1298
01:09:47,471 --> 01:09:52,471
with all these soldiers with PTSD?
Another important aspect of the 

1299
01:09:52,471 --> 01:09:53,620
symposia.
Conferences,

1300
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:58,870
a new organization called Vet Veterans 
for NPO genic therapy.

1301
01:09:58,930 --> 01:09:59,650
Oh,
that's great.

1302
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:05,230
Founders participated in the maps ptsd 
study with MDA and they came away 

1303
01:10:06,371 --> 01:10:11,371
feeling so much better and they want to 
open this up to other veterans and 

1304
01:10:11,371 --> 01:10:14,791
others suffering from Ptsd.
So a portion of the proceeds from the 

1305
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:18,130
[inaudible] conference in the live,
the online live participation will.

1306
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:20,890
We'll go to this organization and to the
ESC.

1307
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,870
That's spectacular.
I'm a huge,

1308
01:10:22,871 --> 01:10:27,871
huge fan of maps.
I've done Rick Doblin on the podcast 

1309
01:10:27,871 --> 01:10:28,900
before.
It was just a fantastic guy and he,

1310
01:10:28,901 --> 01:10:33,901
uh,
they just tweeted me something and I 

1311
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:33,901
retweeted it about,
uh,

1312
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:36,050
they did a new study on autism,
uh,

1313
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:41,070
adult autism Mtma at assisted therapy 
for social anxiety and autistic adults 

1314
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,070
and some amazing,
amazing dinner.

1315
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,390
Charlie Grove working.
Was he working on that?

1316
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:51,570
He's Charlie Grove who's a at Ucla.
He's one of our heffter superstars,

1317
01:10:52,751 --> 01:10:57,751
if you will know his name so we can get 
them on the poster or ob Charles Grope.

1318
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:01,740
He's at Harbor Ucla.
He's done a.

1319
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:04,540
he's done a silicide.
Been end of life study.

1320
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:09,541
He's a member of the heffter board.
I may as well plug heffter here where 

1321
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:13,290
the sort of a small organization that 
nobody knows about.

1322
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:14,490
Heffter.org.

1323
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,810
A cow.
No,

1324
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:18,750
no.
F E,

1325
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:19,770
h e f,
F,

1326
01:11:19,771 --> 01:11:21,540
t,
e r after,

1327
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:26,600
but after it's a nonprofit and basically
we're committed to clinical development 

1328
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:32,700
and clinical protocols with a,
with a psychedelic,

1329
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:37,701
some of kind of staked out.
Silicide been in some ways the same way 

1330
01:11:37,701 --> 01:11:39,840
that Mtma is.
Map says things.

1331
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:44,841
Silicide business our thing.
And we've got several really interesting

1332
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:50,260
protocols.
FDA approved clinical studies right now 

1333
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:53,781
for end of life,
a existential anxiety at the end of 

1334
01:11:53,781 --> 01:11:53,781
life,
uh,

1335
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:58,820
for exploring actually what you might 
call experimental mysticism because a 

1336
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:05,610
psilocybin can reliably induce mystical 
states.

1337
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:08,910
Roland griffiths work at Johns Hopkins 
has shown this,

1338
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:14,120
so it's an actual tool for the first 
time we're actually able to approach 

1339
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,790
transcendent states of mind in a 
controlled clinical setting.

1340
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:19,900
We can reliably,
uh,

1341
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:24,120
induce these states and then study 
what's the brain doing when,

1342
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:28,110
when you're in a state of siliciden 
induced mysticism.

1343
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:33,260
Well,
that's doing a lot of things similar to 

1344
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:34,400
the state of a mystical experience when 
you're on the nat.

1345
01:12:34,401 --> 01:12:35,070
Sure.
Whatever.

1346
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,780
I'm not sure that even.
But anyway,

1347
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:41,781
heffter.org,
most of the leading researchers in 

1348
01:12:41,781 --> 01:12:46,070
psychedelic science right now are either
on our board are being funded by heffter

1349
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:50,940
and so we have funding and we're 
focusing on suicide,

1350
01:12:50,941 --> 01:12:54,510
but then we work closely with maps,
but maps gets all the attention,

1351
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,880
which is fine.
They are doing beautiful work,

1352
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:59,220
but we're also doing effective 
important.

1353
01:12:59,280 --> 01:12:59,790
Well,
we'll,

1354
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:04,791
we'll certainly get some people to you.
I'm heffter h e f f t e r.org.org

1355
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:09,540
named after Arthur heffter actually 
who's the.

1356
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:14,930
He was a 19th century scientist,
the first person to isolate masculine in

1357
01:13:15,151 --> 01:13:20,151
a pure form from pod and demonstrate 
that it was the main ingredient of,

1358
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:25,690
of payoti based on self experiments.
So he was kind of exemplifies what we 

1359
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:30,780
like to identify with,
you know,

1360
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:35,330
good science driven by curiosity and 
ethics and uh,

1361
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:36,840
yeah,
it's a good organization.

1362
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:41,930
The silicide been connection to 
dimethyltryptamine dimethyltryptamine 

1363
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:42,720
being an endogenous chemical,
a neurotransmitter,

1364
01:13:42,721 --> 01:13:46,080
and psilocybin being very close,
very close.

1365
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:49,050
What is the exact,
like what's the chemical?

1366
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:49,890
Was the.
Okay,

1367
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:55,100
very simple.
Dimethyltryptamine is simply 

1368
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:58,610
dimethyltryptamine a silicon,
which is the active principle of 

1369
01:13:59,671 --> 01:14:04,671
psilocybin.
PSILOCYBIN is converted to allison in 

1370
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:08,091
the body.
So it's what pharmacologists call a pro 

1371
01:14:08,091 --> 01:14:10,140
drug.
It's converted by a very simple chemical

1372
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:11,950
reaction to silverson.

1373
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,560
That's the one that actually interacts 
with the receptors.

1374
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,920
So silicon is chemically four hydroxy 
dimethyltryptamine.

1375
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:25,950
So it differs with one trivial 
substitution on the Indole ring.

1376
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:31,711
That oxygen,
that alcohol group at the top of the 

1377
01:14:31,711 --> 01:14:32,530
Indole ring is what makes it sill a 
sudden.

1378
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:37,531
And not DMT,
but it makes all the difference 

1379
01:14:37,531 --> 01:14:40,441
pharmacologically because silicon is 
orally active and it doesn't require an 

1380
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,940
Mao inhibitor.
And,

1381
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:43,830
and DMT does,
if,

1382
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:47,020
if you need,
that's the Iowasca secret,

1383
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:52,110
you know,
dmt plus Mao inhibitor makes the orally 

1384
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:56,230
active preparation by itself.
DMT is not orally active,

1385
01:14:57,370 --> 01:15:02,370
so you have to take it perennially by 
smoking it or indigenous people make 

1386
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:04,140
snuff out of it and so on.
And they get,

1387
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:08,620
get around that whole a detoxification 
mechanism.

1388
01:15:08,621 --> 01:15:13,621
Your gut is full of his full of Mao 
monetary amine oxidase and the reason 

1389
01:15:14,531 --> 01:15:16,600
it's full of monitoring the next day.
So it's a,

1390
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:21,690
it's a consequences of our evolution as 
omnivores because plants are full of,

1391
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,350
uh,
means,

1392
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:28,830
uh,
most of them are toxic and you don't 

1393
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:28,830
want those.

1394
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:31,950
You've got the,
so you have the detoxification 

1395
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:32,740
mechanism,
but they had also works for dmt.

1396
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:37,741
And for that matter,
we can't be dining on dmt containing 

1397
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:38,290
plants all the time and wandering 
around.

1398
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:43,291
I mean,
you do need to be able to function in 

1399
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:43,291
the world.
Um,

1400
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:48,340
your,
your brother had a fascinating idea 

1401
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:48,340
about,
um,

1402
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:51,830
the,
the idea of Panspermia in relationship 

1403
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:54,680
to a suicide and suicide and being the,
how did you,

1404
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:59,690
what is the exact nomenclature again for
a high four hydroxy four hydroxy trip 

1405
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,710
dimethyltryptamine yeah,
that silicide been,

1406
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:04,750
I don't want to get bogged down in 
chemistry,

1407
01:16:04,751 --> 01:16:08,110
but Phil Psilocybin for the chemists 
among you,

1408
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:13,111
it's got a phosphoryl group and that 
phosphoryl group is cleaved off and that

1409
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:14,840
yields Cilla sin.
Sin.

1410
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:17,690
Sin Is four hydroxy die methyl trip to 
me.

1411
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:22,700
What is silicide been and silicide 
business for phosphoryl dimethyl methyl 

1412
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:23,110
trip to me.

1413
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:27,730
So it's got that phosphoryl group that 
makes it stable,

1414
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:32,731
right?
So that's the form it's stored in the 

1415
01:16:32,731 --> 01:16:33,520
mushroom and it can be quite stable for 
a long time.

1416
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:37,960
Soon as you convert it to Siliciden,
it's very unstable and it's a femoral,

1417
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:42,990
which is one reason why it's so easily 
metabolized by human metabolism.

1418
01:16:44,621 --> 01:16:47,500
It's very compatible with human 
metabolism,

1419
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:50,170
which is a reason why it's so,
you know,

1420
01:16:50,171 --> 01:16:55,171
it's appropriate.
You can give it to people who are quite 

1421
01:16:55,171 --> 01:16:55,171
ill,
you know,

1422
01:16:55,171 --> 01:16:56,560
in terminal states and so on,
and they can tolerate it's,

1423
01:16:56,561 --> 01:17:01,561
it's not a,
it goes through a human organism like 

1424
01:17:01,561 --> 01:17:02,650
ice water.
It's very easily handled.

1425
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:04,220
Uh,
no,

1426
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:04,790
but,
uh,

1427
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:09,840
we don't,
we don't want to get to know down the 

1428
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:09,840
road.
Don't know.

1429
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:09,840
It's,
it's absolutely fascinating.

1430
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:09,840
But yeah,
the,

1431
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,220
uh,
the idea

1432
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:15,220
that your brother was promoting was that
this may have come from another planet 

1433
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:17,450
and that what you might be eating when 
you're eating mushrooms is you're eating

1434
01:17:17,451 --> 01:17:22,451
some sort of an intelligence,
which is the weirdest thing about 

1435
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:23,280
mushrooms is that it feels like they're 
talking to you.

1436
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:28,540
We do have that impression.
This I thou dynamic that's set up and 

1437
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:34,940
the content,
which I guess not everybody has this,

1438
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:35,650
you know,
this,

1439
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:40,220
this feeling of this science fictiony 
she cast to the experience,

1440
01:17:40,221 --> 01:17:43,850
but many people do and they,
they're not all terence Mckenna fans.

1441
01:17:43,851 --> 01:17:44,600
I mean,
if you,

1442
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:50,170
if you follow the terence mckenna recipe
and eat five grams and the absolute 

1443
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:52,310
darkness,
you'll be utterly convinced that they've

1444
01:17:52,311 --> 01:17:57,311
landed there here.
And whether that's just an impression or

1445
01:17:58,821 --> 01:18:00,040
whether it's,
uh,

1446
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:00,670
you know,
some,

1447
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:03,080
again,
I think this is possibly something,

1448
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:09,050
you know,
built into the structure of our nervous 

1449
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:10,010
system,
you know,

1450
01:18:10,011 --> 01:18:11,150
and it may be,
I mean,

1451
01:18:11,151 --> 01:18:16,151
we've always had this,
this fascination with,

1452
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,390
with space,
with,

1453
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:21,120
you know,
with,

1454
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:22,930
with the external,
uh,

1455
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:23,500
you know,
with the,

1456
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:28,900
the,
this sort of longing to maybe return to 

1457
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,410
space.
Maybe that's where we came from.

1458
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:31,550
I don't know,
you know,

1459
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,800
but certainly in,
in this,

1460
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:37,100
in this a evolutionary process of 
cognition,

1461
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:40,310
you know,
which we credit the plants for.

1462
01:18:40,311 --> 01:18:45,311
If we want to buy into that idea,
we credit the plants for bringing about 

1463
01:18:45,311 --> 01:18:47,210
cognition.
The ability to wonder,

1464
01:18:47,211 --> 01:18:49,070
the ability to speculate.
Well,

1465
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:52,970
we can't wonder if very much,
if you're looking down at the ground all

1466
01:18:52,971 --> 01:18:55,910
the time,
you got to look up when you look up,

1467
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:56,840
you,
oh,

1468
01:18:56,990 --> 01:18:59,840
you know,
there's this whole universe out here.

1469
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:02,930
And uh,
what's our connection to that?

1470
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:04,100
You know,
we,

1471
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:09,140
we,
we've always had this intuition that 

1472
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:09,140
there is a connection.
I mean,

1473
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:09,140
I,
I,

1474
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:11,690
uh,
don't go so far as to say,

1475
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,570
you know,
people ridiculed the idea that mushrooms

1476
01:19:14,571 --> 01:19:17,690
might've come from outer space and so 
on,

1477
01:19:17,691 --> 01:19:21,110
and I'm a surface,
it seems like a ridiculous idea,

1478
01:19:21,111 --> 01:19:25,010
but you look a little deeper and maybe 
not so much,

1479
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:30,070
you know,
it's certainly possible that spores are 

1480
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:31,610
one of the hardest substances in nature 
and they can survive.

1481
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:37,650
They can survive in a vacuum and 
radiation dense environments and they're

1482
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:38,800
not effective.

1483
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:43,850
Did the other thing that your brother 
had mentioned was that it was so 

1484
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:48,471
different than other life forms on earth
because of its chemical makeup that he 

1485
01:19:49,861 --> 01:19:54,861
thought that the four hydroxy or for,
for phosphoryl yeah,

1486
01:19:55,411 --> 01:19:56,780
the four hydroxy form

1487
01:19:57,060 --> 01:20:02,060
floral,
a biosynthetic pathway is really only 

1488
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,760
found in this group of mushrooms,
you know,

1489
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:08,180
actually unrelated species.
Yeah.

1490
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:10,500
He wasn't,
he wasn't a biochemist.

1491
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:15,510
I don't know if I agree with that.
I mean mushrooms are so clearly a part 

1492
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:19,320
of a,
you know,

1493
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:24,040
earthly evolution that you can't really 
say that they stand outside of it to.

1494
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,500
I mean,
we know that's true.

1495
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,350
I think if you want to make that 
hypothesis,

1496
01:20:28,351 --> 01:20:31,710
you have to go further back and you have
to say,

1497
01:20:31,711 --> 01:20:32,700
well,
you know,

1498
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:37,350
maybe a super civilization see did our 
ecology at some point,

1499
01:20:37,351 --> 01:20:42,351
not with the genes to make a silly one,
but the genes to make tryptofan and now 

1500
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:49,550
tryptofan all these silicon and 
Serotonin and all these tryptamines come

1501
01:20:49,801 --> 01:20:54,801
from tryptofan.
And tryptofan is one of those 20 amino 

1502
01:20:54,801 --> 01:20:59,151
acids that make up proteins.
So tryptofan is universally found in all

1503
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:01,570
organisms.
It's,

1504
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:02,960
you know,
it's an essential,

1505
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:05,550
a molecule of life,
right?

1506
01:21:05,551 --> 01:21:10,551
It's found in everything.
But to trivial steps away from tryptofan

1507
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:15,681
too.
Trivial enzymatic modifications away 

1508
01:21:15,681 --> 01:21:16,620
from tryptofan.
You've got DMT.

1509
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:19,140
You know,
you remove the carboxyl group,

1510
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:22,440
you stick a couple of methyl groups on 
Tryptophan and there you are.

1511
01:21:22,441 --> 01:21:24,420
You've got DMT.
And I've often thought,

1512
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:28,560
wow,
maybe this is a sort of sub text,

1513
01:21:28,561 --> 01:21:33,180
sub message of nature saying just around
the corner,

1514
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,740
just around the corner from Tryptofan 
is,

1515
01:21:37,741 --> 01:21:38,550
uh,
this,

1516
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:42,120
this compound that opens the door to 
other dimensions,

1517
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,260
pay attention monkeys.

1518
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:50,890
Fascinating that trip,
defend converts to eventually converge 

1519
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:51,710
to Serotonin.
That is

1520
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:54,860
Serotonin is just another trip to me.
Uh,

1521
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:59,870
in fact,
chemically Serotonin is five hydroxy 

1522
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:03,500
tryptamine.
Siliciden is four hydroxy die methyl 

1523
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,250
trip to me.
Blue photo name,

1524
01:22:05,251 --> 01:22:09,750
another one of these hallucinogens is 
five hydroxy methyl trip to me.

1525
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,360
So they're all,
you know,

1526
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,310
very close to each other.
You see the diagrams,

1527
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,230
I'll hail.
There you are,

1528
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:19,950
there you go.
Right?

1529
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,500
So you can see how,
how it works,

1530
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:25,710
the idea that mushrooms come from outer 
space,

1531
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:30,720
it seems ridiculous to some folks,
but the reality is we were made out of 

1532
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:34,281
stars that everything comes from outer 
space and I think that as we get further

1533
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,210
along in our understanding of the 
universe,

1534
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:41,540
I think we're going to realize that 
everything is kind of fractal and there 

1535
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,331
really is no separation between this 
planet and other planets of the whole 

1536
01:22:44,331 --> 01:22:45,150
thing is just one big soup.

1537
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,550
Right,
right,

1538
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,520
exactly.
And,

1539
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:49,110
you know,
any,

1540
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:52,140
um,
prebiotic environment,

1541
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:57,310
I mean,
we don't know that much about exactly 

1542
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:59,901
how life evolved,
but we know that in certain situations 

1543
01:22:59,901 --> 01:23:03,150
you've got to a buildup of organic 
compounds and,

1544
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:04,950
uh,
under the right,

1545
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,200
it just seems to be a property of 
matter.

1546
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:12,670
You know,
Adam's molecules fall together in such a

1547
01:23:12,671 --> 01:23:15,640
way that before you know it,
you've got living systems.

1548
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:20,770
You've brought this up twice and I can't
ignore it because he brought it up in 

1549
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:20,770
the last podcast as well.
You,

1550
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:25,330
you are fascinated by the idea of life 
being seated here by some intelligent 

1551
01:23:25,371 --> 01:23:26,480
force.
Uh,

1552
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,340
Amber Lyon,
who,

1553
01:23:28,341 --> 01:23:30,620
uh,
I discussed earlier,

1554
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:35,830
she had a vision of that actually 
happening on Iowasca and many other 

1555
01:23:36,741 --> 01:23:41,741
people have as well.
Do you think that that's something that 

1556
01:23:41,741 --> 01:23:43,010
is,
is a real possibility?

1557
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:44,000
Yes,
I do.

1558
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:46,040
Wow,
that's a heavy one.

1559
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:51,220
When you bring that one up,
you get thrown into that certain 

1560
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:51,220
category right away.
Oh,

1561
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:51,830
Dennis Mckenna.
It's fucking gotta.

1562
01:23:51,831 --> 01:23:55,370
Read my book.
We actually in my book,

1563
01:23:55,371 --> 01:23:56,150
I mean it was.
Which one?

1564
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:56,860
My book.
Oh,

1565
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:58,300
the latest one.
The Old Lady.

1566
01:23:58,310 --> 01:24:00,470
Latest one.
I wrote the Brotherhood of the screaming

1567
01:24:00,471 --> 01:24:01,250
abyss.
Oh,

1568
01:24:01,251 --> 01:24:02,960
that's the one you promoted last time 
you were on here,

1569
01:24:02,961 --> 01:24:05,040
which is excellent.
Which for that,

1570
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:07,760
that was really good.
If you haven't bought it,

1571
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:10,640
please folks go by.
It really gave her that.

1572
01:24:10,641 --> 01:24:11,990
You really gave it a boost.

1573
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:17,020
But I actually talk about that.
Talk about this at some length about 

1574
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:21,350
this idea.
Could this really be,

1575
01:24:21,351 --> 01:24:22,880
and I'm trying to,
uh,

1576
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:24,080
uh,
you know,

1577
01:24:24,081 --> 01:24:27,530
discuss it from the standpoint of a 
critic of the idea.

1578
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:27,920
Say,
well,

1579
01:24:27,921 --> 01:24:29,780
that's totally ridiculous,
you know,

1580
01:24:29,781 --> 01:24:32,240
how could that be?
And they just dismiss it.

1581
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,970
I tried to go a little deeper intuitive.
Say,

1582
01:24:34,971 --> 01:24:35,660
well,
wait a minute,

1583
01:24:35,661 --> 01:24:40,661
let's step back from this a little bit.
And if you think about our existential 

1584
01:24:42,441 --> 01:24:47,270
situation,
how unlikely it is that we are even here

1585
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:51,320
that consciousness exists,
that this civilization exists.

1586
01:24:51,321 --> 01:24:53,180
I mean in,
in,

1587
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:54,460
in the,
in the,

1588
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:59,500
from the standpoint of the improbables,
we're living in a very improbable 

1589
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,500
situation.
You know,

1590
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:01,670
if we should,
you know,

1591
01:25:01,671 --> 01:25:06,671
I don't think this is going on.
I think that life is probably a 

1592
01:25:06,671 --> 01:25:11,260
widespread in the universe,
but I think intelligence is rare and the

1593
01:25:11,661 --> 01:25:15,950
fact that we find ourselves in that 
existential situation,

1594
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:17,930
you know,
maybe we need to look,

1595
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,000
take another look at this and say,
well,

1596
01:25:20,001 --> 01:25:22,190
maybe this is not such a crazy idea.

1597
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:23,030
You know,
that,

1598
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:25,430
I mean,
I do think that intelligence,

1599
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:26,680
uh,
you know,

1600
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:29,030
is,
we're not the only ones.

1601
01:25:29,031 --> 01:25:30,830
And I think,
you know,

1602
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:32,670
and,
uh,

1603
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:35,990
I don't know if I generated into 
incoherence here,

1604
01:25:35,991 --> 01:25:40,991
but I think that intelligence can have 
an influence on the evolution of even 

1605
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:42,290
the universe.
You know,

1606
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:46,250
it's a force in the universe.
And I think that mind is probably,

1607
01:25:46,251 --> 01:25:47,330
uh,
uh,

1608
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,980
you know,
as primary,

1609
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:50,450
uh,
uh,

1610
01:25:50,451 --> 01:25:54,800
feature of reality as,
as the quantum foam.

1611
01:25:54,801 --> 01:25:55,610
I mean,
it may not,

1612
01:25:55,970 --> 01:25:58,460
it may not even be separate from it,
you know.

1613
01:25:58,461 --> 01:26:03,100
So it's okay to say we don't know.
And,

1614
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:03,950
and,
you know,

1615
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:04,160
one

1616
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,600
of the problems with science is,
uh,

1617
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:09,630
it,
it tends to be arrogant to,

1618
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:14,631
tends to assume that it knows a lot more
than it knows.

1619
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:20,050
And we actually have a,
we have a very detailed understanding 

1620
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:23,720
scientifically,
of very small pieces of reality,

1621
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:27,140
you know,
and so there's a tendency to say,

1622
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:29,090
well,
we've got it all figured out.

1623
01:26:29,091 --> 01:26:30,830
No,
you haven't got it figured out.

1624
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:33,290
You haven't got even a 10th of it 
figured out,

1625
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:38,860
which is another useful a message that 
Iowasca and other entheogens,

1626
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:43,020
other psychedelics a reminded us of,
you know,

1627
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:48,030
I mean,
Iowaska never fails to remind me and a 

1628
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:49,190
lot of people remember you don't,
Oh shit,

1629
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:52,250
you know,
you don't know shit,

1630
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:57,750
you know,
so get off your high horse and be a 

1631
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,800
little more humble and be open to 
learning.

1632
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:05,220
It's all right in front of us.
If we go back and look at what we know 

1633
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,930
about human history and what they knew 
and how we laugh at what they knew,

1634
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:12,730
then we will go back to the time when 
they thought the world was flat,

1635
01:27:12,731 --> 01:27:14,230
back to the time where,
you know,

1636
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:19,320
they were killing Bruno because he 
thought that the universe was infinite 

1637
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:19,840
back to.
I mean,

1638
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:22,780
there's all these different things that 
people like how to consensus.

1639
01:27:22,781 --> 01:27:27,781
Um,
there were absolutely incorrect that we 

1640
01:27:27,781 --> 01:27:29,500
go back then we were foolish.
That was a blink of an eye ego,

1641
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,570
right?
So the message is

1642
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:36,670
be aware of what everybody knows.
Beware of cultural consensus,

1643
01:27:36,991 --> 01:27:40,230
because chances are in 100 years what we
thought we knew,

1644
01:27:40,231 --> 01:27:42,390
we'll just be seen in that light.
I mean,

1645
01:27:42,391 --> 01:27:44,070
we were so stupid back then.

1646
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:46,630
Yeah,
that's also one of those things too,

1647
01:27:46,631 --> 01:27:50,550
when you're discussing aliens be 
discussing the possibility of a,

1648
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:53,560
an alien life form.
We want to think it's preposterous,

1649
01:27:53,561 --> 01:27:56,890
but we're preposterous if we,
if we didn't exist,

1650
01:27:57,250 --> 01:28:02,250
oh my God,
the most ridiculous thing ever right 

1651
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:06,480
behind me,
dead people that were locked in a cage 

1652
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,120
and I honored them.
This photos behind me of Jimmy Hendrix 

1653
01:28:09,521 --> 01:28:12,250
and the Elvis actually apparently wasn't
really a,

1654
01:28:12,251 --> 01:28:13,480
a,
a mugshot.

1655
01:28:13,481 --> 01:28:16,240
He was just a law enforcement not 
wanting to get his picture,

1656
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:19,240
which is even more ridiculous.
He loved the fact that people got locked

1657
01:28:19,241 --> 01:28:24,241
into cages so much.
He wanted to get a fake picture of him 

1658
01:28:24,241 --> 01:28:25,480
locked in a cage is most likely,
was high as fuck on pills,

1659
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:30,910
you know?
And he went to the Nixon to be a drug 

1660
01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:30,910
and.
Exactly.

1661
01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:32,290
And then this woman,
Rosa parks,

1662
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:37,410
she got arrested because she had too 
much melanin in our skin to sit in a 

1663
01:28:37,481 --> 01:28:40,510
certain spot on a moving piece of 
transportation.

1664
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:42,280
And then she was celebrated as a hero.
I mean,

1665
01:28:42,281 --> 01:28:44,020
we're fucking crazy.
Right?

1666
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:46,220
So totally why?
Wow.

1667
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:51,410
Just the fact that we exist at all.
Why would we deny the idea that 

1668
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,440
something else far more advanced than us
exists somewhere else?

1669
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,110
No,
no different than us looking at,

1670
01:28:56,380 --> 01:29:01,380
you know,
when we find primates using tools and 

1671
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:01,380
evidence of using tools without any 
human.

1672
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,800
Like they just figured it out how to do 
it on their own to get inside of and 

1673
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,270
hills and things like that.
We're fascinated by amazing.

1674
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,240
Look what we've discovered.
Jesus Christ.

1675
01:29:09,241 --> 01:29:10,020
It's easy.
Shit,

1676
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:13,440
you know,
like compare us to something else.

1677
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:15,120
They would probably look at us the same 
way.

1678
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:16,120
Look at these dummies.
They're,

1679
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:18,390
they're worshiping people that were 
locked in cages.

1680
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:24,540
Right.
You're a hero because you're sitting in 

1681
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:24,540
a different spot.

1682
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:24,540
That's the thing.
We're.

1683
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:27,120
Yeah.
We're observing experiment of some sort.

1684
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:28,470
And whether,
you know,

1685
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:30,170
we're,
you know,

1686
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:35,360
some civilization,
some super civilization as genetically 

1687
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:39,651
engineered this whole ecosystem and 
create a trip to fan and see did it into

1688
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:46,040
the ecosystem,
knowing that over the course of 

1689
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,711
evolutionary time it was going to 
develop things like siliciden and 

1690
01:29:48,711 --> 01:29:51,390
Serotonin.
It's almost as though the civilization,

1691
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:56,391
this hypothetical civilization wanted 
somebody to talk to and in order to do 

1692
01:29:56,581 --> 01:29:59,820
that it had to invent as primates,
you know,

1693
01:29:59,821 --> 01:30:04,821
and it had to get us talking first to 
our plants and maybe eventually we'll 

1694
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:07,440
get a chance to talk to them,
whoever they are,

1695
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:09,720
you know,
or maybe they're already here.

1696
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:14,750
I mean,
there are a lot of people say they're 

1697
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:14,750
already here,
you know,

1698
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:14,750
and I,

1699
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:15,460
yeah,
I don't.

1700
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:20,610
Who knows,
the other problem is there's so many 

1701
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:22,731
people that are full of shit.
Well that is the area where flakiness is

1702
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:27,950
flourishes hugely.
I had this Saifai show,

1703
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:33,430
um,
and we stopped doing it for and they 

1704
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:36,621
wanted to keep doing it.
But I didn't want to do it anymore 

1705
01:30:36,621 --> 01:30:37,980
because I got tired of talking to liars.
I couldn't handle it anymore.

1706
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:43,160
We interviewed bigfoot Pete Boone Ufo 
people and some of them are well 

1707
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:44,760
intentioned folks,
but there was a lot of liars.

1708
01:30:44,761 --> 01:30:45,950
There was a lot of people that were 
just.

1709
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:50,520
There was a psychological issue and I 
can clearly see it because when you have

1710
01:30:50,521 --> 01:30:53,520
a podcast with someone and he sit down 
with someone for three hours,

1711
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:57,720
you can bullshit someone for a seven 
minute interview on a news show,

1712
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:00,990
but you can't bullshit someone for three
hours after three hours.

1713
01:31:00,991 --> 01:31:05,991
Weird things start to show up like weird
patterns or will you just can't keep 

1714
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:06,330
the.

1715
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:11,570
Can't keep the rhythm up so to speak.
Especially if you could do multiple 

1716
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:11,980
podcasts like,
oh,

1717
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:13,380
crack you.
After two or three,

1718
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:15,300
I'll find you.
You might be very clever,

1719
01:31:15,301 --> 01:31:18,720
but after two or three little things get
exposed and you're like,

1720
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:23,820
hm,
we reveal the basis to keep the rhythm 

1721
01:31:26,461 --> 01:31:27,210
going.
You know,

1722
01:31:27,211 --> 01:31:29,820
it's just after a while if you're full 
of Shit,

1723
01:31:29,821 --> 01:31:31,410
you're full of shit.
Also to yourself,

1724
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:36,680
and that's something that I've found is 
that people that are constantly 

1725
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:40,491
deceptive,
there are also internally deceptive and 

1726
01:31:40,491 --> 01:31:43,790
that that manifests itself in weird 
things that they say that they don't 

1727
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:44,850
even realize.
They're bizarre because they,

1728
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:50,370
they're also easier to trick themselves 
I think because I think they lose their 

1729
01:31:50,461 --> 01:31:52,140
ability to really,
uh,

1730
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:53,660
to,
to see things objective,

1731
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:59,530
falsifiable facts,
things that you can prove that that's or

1732
01:31:59,531 --> 01:31:59,920
not

1733
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:04,690
the scientific method is important.
And all of this theoretical conversation

1734
01:32:04,691 --> 01:32:09,691
is nice about whether we had,
we have the imprints of other 

1735
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:11,500
civilizations in our,
our ecosystem.

1736
01:32:11,501 --> 01:32:16,501
But the fact is we have an ecosystem and
we have maybe we delude ourselves that 

1737
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:21,541
we have some control over its evolution 
or a stewardship of it,

1738
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,720
but we certainly have this opportunity 
to,

1739
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:27,700
to either destroy the planet or,
or preserve it

1740
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,840
well.
We certainly have an effect and we're 

1741
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:33,570
certainly conscious in some way,
shape or form of that effect.

1742
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:36,360
And when you extrapolate that to a 
$100,000

1743
01:32:36,361 --> 01:32:39,420
million years from now,
if the civilization or something similar

1744
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:41,940
survives,
well you got to think that it's going to

1745
01:32:41,941 --> 01:32:44,500
be something like an alien invasion that
we,

1746
01:32:44,501 --> 01:32:45,010
we,
we,

1747
01:32:45,030 --> 01:32:50,030
we really will be like that thing that 
wants to see the universe if we 

1748
01:32:50,030 --> 01:32:52,040
recognize,
especially if you're being,

1749
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,040
if you're an intelligent being and you 
recognize that a star is a out we did,

1750
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:57,720
a star is only good to support life for 
another billion years.

1751
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:03,180
That's not a lot of time.
If you really stop and think about how 

1752
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:07,581
long time has existed on earth and if 
you were an intelligent species that 

1753
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:08,760
lived 100 million years from now and 
you're like,

1754
01:33:08,761 --> 01:33:09,450
hey,
you know,

1755
01:33:09,451 --> 01:33:14,451
we only have nine more of these to go.
We have nine more of these 100 million 

1756
01:33:14,451 --> 01:33:18,261
cycles and then we're fucked.
Then the Sun Burns out and there's no 

1757
01:33:18,261 --> 01:33:19,110
life here.
We gotta get moving.

1758
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:19,680
You know,

1759
01:33:19,730 --> 01:33:22,240
we stuck here.
Yeah,

1760
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:27,320
that's very interesting.
I've often thought that these 

1761
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:30,440
cosmological models,
I think we got more than a billion 

1762
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:33,711
years.
The cosmological models say 10 to a 

1763
01:33:33,711 --> 01:33:34,660
hundred billion years,
maybe a trillion years

1764
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,850
with the sun,
I think.

1765
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:38,650
Hold the sun.
Yeah,

1766
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:41,420
the sun doesn't have our planet.
It's a support line.

1767
01:33:41,421 --> 01:33:46,150
It's got maybe 4 billion years.
But if we haven't figured out how to get

1768
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:50,080
out by that time,
we're not paying attention,

1769
01:33:50,081 --> 01:33:52,660
you know,
but getting these costumes or Gideon,

1770
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:54,160
exactly.
Or Gideon,

1771
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,740
that's a very important point that,
you know,

1772
01:33:56,741 --> 01:33:57,330
I mean,
this,

1773
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:02,360
uh,
I've been told on psychedelics many 

1774
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:04,000
times the only way out is to go in,
but,

1775
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:05,170
but this,
you know,

1776
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,870
these cosmological models,
if you look at them,

1777
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:11,740
which are kind of dreary and depressing 
when you think about it,

1778
01:34:11,741 --> 01:34:16,741
you know,
it's just now the current model is just 

1779
01:34:16,741 --> 01:34:18,850
endless expansion and not only expansion
but accelerated expansion.

1780
01:34:18,851 --> 01:34:22,300
You're talking about the heat death of 
the universe and you know,

1781
01:34:22,301 --> 01:34:24,700
not very much interested in is going to 
happen.

1782
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:30,420
But the key factor that these models do 
not a do not integrate into their 

1783
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,990
planning his mind and consciousness,
you know.

1784
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:38,440
And that makes all the difference that,
you know,

1785
01:34:38,441 --> 01:34:42,400
if you look far enough ahead,
that's gonna affect the way the cosmos.

1786
01:34:42,401 --> 01:34:45,190
He falls and uh,
uh,

1787
01:34:45,191 --> 01:34:50,191
you know,
and they don't take that into account 

1788
01:34:50,191 --> 01:34:50,350
and it's impossible to really know what 
the effects of it is.

1789
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:53,020
But I don't buy the fact that it's all 
going.

1790
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:58,021
It just kind of Peter out.
And finally the last flicker is going to

1791
01:34:58,611 --> 01:35:03,611
go out and it's just darkness and cold.
I don't by that I mean surely there's 

1792
01:35:05,511 --> 01:35:07,230
gotta be more to it than that.
Well,

1793
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:11,210
the trip might be what we're missing.
Our emr trip may be.

1794
01:35:11,211 --> 01:35:12,050
Yeah,
exactly.

1795
01:35:12,051 --> 01:35:17,051
I mean if you look at quantum models and
we know there's know three dimensions of

1796
01:35:17,151 --> 01:35:20,330
space and one of time,
but then there's the,

1797
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:25,360
what is it,
the six or eight other dimensions that 

1798
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,480
are all folded in and you don't see 
that,

1799
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:29,630
but what's in there,
what's it?

1800
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:35,080
But that's the feeling that you get on 
dimethyltryptamine is that you've 

1801
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:36,110
entered into a new area,
a new space,

1802
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:41,440
and that space is somehow or another 
inhabited with something that's 

1803
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:45,731
communicating in some nonverbal forum 
that reaches you as intent.

1804
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:51,010
It reaches you like content and that 
that might be where consciousness is 

1805
01:35:51,010 --> 01:35:53,510
headed.
Once we free ourselves from this sort of

1806
01:35:53,511 --> 01:35:55,490
carbon based shell that we're,
we're,

1807
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:58,820
we're clinging to that,
we might figure that out.

1808
01:35:58,821 --> 01:35:59,470
That like,
oh,

1809
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:00,010
we're,
we're,

1810
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:05,110
we're at a rest stop.
We didn't realize that we could drive 

1811
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:08,030
just a couple miles down the road and 
there's the fucking yellowstone national

1812
01:36:08,031 --> 01:36:08,390
park.

1813
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:10,600
Like,
we got that,

1814
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:15,780
the rest stop.
We thought that that's where we were 

1815
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:19,240
eating shitty food and breathing trucker
farts and we saw there was,

1816
01:36:20,190 --> 01:36:22,490
oh my God,
we just had to just figure it out.

1817
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:23,960
Yeah,
I don't,

1818
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:26,840
I don't,
I don't dismiss that possibility.

1819
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:31,990
I mean this,
this I vow relationship and that we say 

1820
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:32,270
that again,
I vow.

1821
01:36:32,271 --> 01:36:37,271
I vow this thing that mushrooms,
other psychedelics for their specialty 

1822
01:36:37,271 --> 01:36:39,980
mushrooms seep to set up this dialogue 
situation.

1823
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:42,080
You know,
when you're getting this information,

1824
01:36:42,081 --> 01:36:45,020
but it's very hard to evaluate whether 
it's,

1825
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:47,840
whether it's bullshit or whether there's
something to it.

1826
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:52,900
My,
my brother used to play games with the 

1827
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:52,900
mushrooms.
You know,

1828
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:55,700
what he would take them at these high 
doses alone and say,

1829
01:36:55,701 --> 01:36:57,230
well,
how do I know that?

1830
01:36:57,231 --> 01:37:02,231
What you're telling me is real,
tell me something I cannot possibly 

1831
01:37:02,231 --> 01:37:03,230
know.
You know?

1832
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:08,320
And they would never,
they would never cough it up because it 

1833
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:08,320
was like,
you know.

1834
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:09,260
But it was like,
all right,

1835
01:37:09,261 --> 01:37:14,261
I want the blueprints to the star ship 
now download the blueprints.

1836
01:37:15,021 --> 01:37:18,890
Now I don't believe that you're,
you are what you say you are.

1837
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:21,320
And they're very invasive.
You know,

1838
01:37:21,321 --> 01:37:23,690
they'd never give you that kind of 
thing.

1839
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:26,560
But they.
So,

1840
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:28,520
you know,
I don't know.

1841
01:37:28,630 --> 01:37:32,140
I have this thought on,
for people who've heard this podcast,

1842
01:37:32,141 --> 01:37:33,730
unfortunately,
I have to repeat myself.

1843
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:38,290
I have this idea that we have this,
uh,

1844
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,960
this dismissal of psychedelic 
experience,

1845
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:44,920
uh,
as hallucination and hallucination being

1846
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:49,950
frivolous.
And my thought is that if you absorb 

1847
01:37:50,351 --> 01:37:55,351
some sort of a psychedelic compound and 
have this intense moment where you do 

1848
01:37:55,771 --> 01:38:00,550
pass into another dimension and you,
you meet with pure love and the,

1849
01:38:00,551 --> 01:38:00,870
the,
the,

1850
01:38:00,871 --> 01:38:05,871
the very wiring of the universe is 
exposed to you and you get to see the 

1851
01:38:07,021 --> 01:38:10,530
fractal nature of reality and some 
incredibly profound for them.

1852
01:38:10,531 --> 01:38:12,210
And that is what you're actually 
experiencing.

1853
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:17,450
Or if it's just your imagination and you
go there and it's all in your mind,

1854
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:22,860
but you have the exact same experience,
it's still the same,

1855
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:27,600
like this idea that everything that's 
real has to be.

1856
01:38:27,601 --> 01:38:29,940
You have to be able to take a tape 
measure and touch it,

1857
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:35,090
that you have to be able to put it on a 
scale that you have to be able to 

1858
01:38:35,090 --> 01:38:37,731
quantify the ingredients.
Oh well it's made out of aluminum and 

1859
01:38:37,731 --> 01:38:38,700
this is glass and you know,
the keyboard is plastic that,

1860
01:38:38,701 --> 01:38:40,350
that.
Now I know a laptop's real.

1861
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:40,350
No,

1862
01:38:40,610 --> 01:38:43,190
but I'm here to tell you it's all 
hallucination,

1863
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:44,180
right?
Right.

1864
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,520
I mean,
we dwell in a hallucination.

1865
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:49,250
That's what,
that's what the brain does,

1866
01:38:49,251 --> 01:38:54,020
is it creates a model of reality that is
that we live in.

1867
01:38:54,021 --> 01:38:56,620
We never experienced reality,
you know,

1868
01:38:56,621 --> 01:39:01,621
I mean we take it on faith really,
that there's some external reality out 

1869
01:39:01,621 --> 01:39:05,231
there,
but everything comes to us through the 

1870
01:39:05,231 --> 01:39:07,841
filter and is processed and extruded,
if you will,

1871
01:39:07,971 --> 01:39:12,140
into a more or less comprehensible most 
of the time,

1872
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:16,550
a model of reality and that's where we 
live.

1873
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:19,580
Reality is out there somewhere.
It's unknowable,

1874
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,840
you know,
but we're getting signals through this 

1875
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,611
sensory neural interface and then the 
brain is basically a processing a device

1876
01:39:29,241 --> 01:39:34,241
that takes that information,
combines it with internal associations 

1877
01:39:34,241 --> 01:39:38,591
and everything and generates the 
hallucination that you and I and 

1878
01:39:38,591 --> 01:39:40,370
everybody else are living in at this 
very moment.

1879
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:45,370
You know,
we're all part of this constructed 

1880
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:48,280
reality.
So people dismiss it as psychedelic 

1881
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,610
experiences.
Hallucination,

1882
01:39:49,611 --> 01:39:51,680
I would say.
No it is,

1883
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:55,850
but it's just another hallucination and 
it's all hallucination.

1884
01:39:55,910 --> 01:40:00,910
It's all or at least interpretation of 
something personal interpretation and 

1885
01:40:01,130 --> 01:40:04,370
personal interpretation.
I mean the world physics.

1886
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:09,400
We know enough through physics about 
this supposedly external reality to know

1887
01:40:09,441 --> 01:40:12,550
that it doesn't look anything like what 
we're experiencing,

1888
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:15,110
you know,
it's all buzzing the electrons,

1889
01:40:15,111 --> 01:40:18,770
most of it's empty space.
This table is not solid.

1890
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:23,120
It's mostly empty space.
It's soul energy and energy flexes.

1891
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:26,810
We don't experience the world that way 
most of the time.

1892
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:30,800
Sometimes on psychedelics we do.
So maybe we're getting a,

1893
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:34,880
an actual peak into the way it's really 
constructed that,

1894
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:35,620
you know,
we get to,

1895
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:40,300
we get to look at the circuit board and 
turn it over temporarily and look at it,

1896
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:42,260
oh,
this is how it's wired.

1897
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:47,290
You know,
this is the reality generating machine 

1898
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:49,850
that you get to look at when you strip 
away,

1899
01:40:50,230 --> 01:40:51,290
uh,
you know,

1900
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:52,070
the,
the,

1901
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:54,010
when you take the cover and look at the

1902
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,960
way it's,
it's,

1903
01:40:54,961 --> 01:40:56,440
uh,
the diagram is wired.

1904
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:01,500
Then you get some insights into it.
So then that's a useful thing because 

1905
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:02,950
then you can go back and you can say,
well,

1906
01:41:02,951 --> 01:41:05,560
none of this is real.
Let's not get carried away that,

1907
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:11,060
you know,
this is any more real than anything 

1908
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:11,180
else.
And that seems to be like the,

1909
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:14,950
the information that's coming from folks
that study subatomic particles,

1910
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:20,110
that,
that inflammation is one of the most 

1911
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:21,991
undeniable pieces of information that 
the universe is not what you think it 

1912
01:41:21,991 --> 01:41:22,280
is.
It's not what you think.

1913
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:27,390
It's just,
it's impossible for it to be what you 

1914
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:27,390
think it is.
When you study subatomic particles,

1915
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:30,340
when you study things that can exist in 
two places at the same time.

1916
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:35,490
Like what are you talking about?
Like how they blink in and out of 

1917
01:41:35,490 --> 01:41:35,490
existence.
What does that mean when they go away?

1918
01:41:35,490 --> 01:41:40,200
What do you mean to go away?
They go when they come back with the 

1919
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,691
fuck.
Are you saying go away and they come 

1920
01:41:42,691 --> 01:41:42,691
back?
Are they here?

1921
01:41:42,691 --> 01:41:43,090
Are they not here?
Well they are and they're not.

1922
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:45,400
Well they move.
Yes.

1923
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:50,020
But they also stand still at the same 
time was like superposition.

1924
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:52,500
Like when someone.
I had Dr Goswami,

1925
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,390
he's a theoretical physicist.
He tried to explain super position to me

1926
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:57,100
and I was like,
wait a minute,

1927
01:41:57,101 --> 01:41:57,730
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1928
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:02,290
It's moving.
And it's still at the same time.

1929
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:03,260
Right,
right,

1930
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,170
right.
What are you talking about?

1931
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:08,920
Like what does that mean?
So here you have physics,

1932
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:13,950
you know,
the absolute sort of cutting edge 

1933
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:16,561
science,
the one that we've charged with 

1934
01:42:16,561 --> 01:42:16,960
explaining the fundamental nature of 
reality.

1935
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:21,610
And you talked to these people and it 
sounds like the rates of schizophrenia,

1936
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:24,780
it sounds like someone who's on drugs.
Yeah,

1937
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:29,850
it doesn't deem.
It sounds like someone who may have the 

1938
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:31,570
mathematics and the measurements and all
that to back it up and say,

1939
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:32,440
look,
I'm sorry,

1940
01:42:32,441 --> 01:42:37,441
this is how it is.
This what our math at our instruments 

1941
01:42:37,441 --> 01:42:41,281
tell us if you want to trust that.
It's like we send a scout and the scout 

1942
01:42:42,491 --> 01:42:45,130
went over the top of the hill and saw 
the impossible.

1943
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:46,300
Yeah.
And came back and go,

1944
01:42:46,301 --> 01:42:47,470
okay.
Yeah,

1945
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:50,890
yeah.
Don't go over there.

1946
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:56,060
It becomes a rainbow that talks to you,
right?

1947
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

1948
01:42:59,381 --> 01:43:00,250
Um,
that,

1949
01:43:00,251 --> 01:43:03,190
that is,
it's fascinating because the,

1950
01:43:03,191 --> 01:43:08,191
uh,
the explanations of reality by these 

1951
01:43:08,191 --> 01:43:12,091
physicists are in fact more bizarre than
the experiences that are relayed by 

1952
01:43:12,971 --> 01:43:14,710
people would take Iowasca.
Absolutely.

1953
01:43:14,711 --> 01:43:19,711
Those are way more believable than 
particles and superposition or the fact 

1954
01:43:19,711 --> 01:43:22,120
that it's all empty space.
Moving in a vibration.

1955
01:43:22,121 --> 01:43:24,470
And why do you know it's wood,
man?

1956
01:43:24,471 --> 01:43:27,290
What are you talking about?
This is would hear it and that's not.

1957
01:43:27,291 --> 01:43:28,630
I hit you over the head.
That shit's gonna hurt.

1958
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,580
This is real.
There's no empty space there,

1959
01:43:30,581 --> 01:43:31,480
dude.
You're crazy.

1960
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:33,120
But no,
that's.

1961
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:34,430
That is what it is.
Yeah.

1962
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:35,620
Well,
it's all real.

1963
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:38,140
Yes.
Anything you experienced,

1964
01:43:38,141 --> 01:43:40,690
you can't dismiss it.
You can't say it's not real.

1965
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:46,100
It's just not necessarily the absolute 
reality and I don't know if there is an 

1966
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:47,770
absolute reality.
I agree with you and I think that's also

1967
01:43:47,771 --> 01:43:51,010
one of the transformative parts of the 
psychedelic experience,

1968
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:56,200
that the experience itself is 
transformative because you're 

1969
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,520
experiencing it doesn't matter if it's 
not real.

1970
01:43:59,130 --> 01:44:01,760
What does that mean?
It means nothing means nothing.

1971
01:44:01,761 --> 01:44:02,720
Not Real.
These are.

1972
01:44:02,830 --> 01:44:03,320
These are

1973
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:06,760
dualistic delusions.
You know?

1974
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:09,010
It's none of it's real.
It's all real.

1975
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:14,400
So established,
established fact that when you get to 

1976
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,510
the lowest measurable portion of 
reality,

1977
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:20,050
when you get to subatomic particles,
it's fucking magic.

1978
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:25,230
Okay,
so we go from there and then let's look 

1979
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:25,230
at.
Well,

1980
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:25,990
it's all in your imagination.
Well,

1981
01:44:25,991 --> 01:44:30,991
let's look at what that means because 
everything you see on this planet that a

1982
01:44:31,541 --> 01:44:35,290
human being has made has somehow or 
other popped out of the imagination.

1983
01:44:35,291 --> 01:44:40,291
The imagination is a factory for 
televisions and the Internet and 

1984
01:44:40,291 --> 01:44:40,700
airplanes,
right?

1985
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:45,840
Condoms and eyeglasses and laptops.
I mean the imagination is a motherfucker

1986
01:44:47,230 --> 01:44:50,710
and we have this idea that the 
imagination is this frivolous thing.

1987
01:44:50,890 --> 01:44:55,890
Oh,
billy just sits in the field and 

1988
01:44:55,890 --> 01:44:56,530
imagined what the world could be.
How about your dig a ditch,

1989
01:44:56,531 --> 01:44:58,720
billy,
how about you go to work billy,

1990
01:44:58,930 --> 01:45:03,930
hammer some nails and be a man.
Pull yourself up by your bootstraps and 

1991
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:05,780
stop crying because you're freaking out 
about the fact that everything's air.

1992
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:09,420
Everything is particles and it's all 
know the whole thing.

1993
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:11,850
Or are you sitting in a field and you 
know,

1994
01:45:11,950 --> 01:45:16,760
you take LSD and you're steve jobs and 
you have all these fantasies except that

1995
01:45:16,761 --> 01:45:21,761
you actually make it happen.
You create the apple computer or 

1996
01:45:21,761 --> 01:45:25,981
whatever.
And that was a psychedelic vision and 

1997
01:45:25,981 --> 01:45:26,640
was at the time and remained so,
and you know,

1998
01:45:26,710 --> 01:45:31,710
this thing here,
I mean this is the little psychedelic 

1999
01:45:31,710 --> 01:45:31,710
toy of the future,
you know,

2000
01:45:31,710 --> 01:45:33,850
it's in my hand that it exists.

2001
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:38,520
Will you ask it questions and it goes 
online and it gives you the answer.

2002
01:45:38,521 --> 01:45:43,110
So the entire volume of human 
understanding and that subject,

2003
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:45,150
the consensus,
this is,

2004
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:46,830
you know,
like where you were just explaining,

2005
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:51,420
explaining what the chemical definition 
of silicon is or the description of it.

2006
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,300
You can find that out like that.
I had to go to you.

2007
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:55,490
You're an expert.
You,

2008
01:45:55,491 --> 01:45:57,960
you came to me with your,
your education,

2009
01:45:57,961 --> 01:46:01,170
you explained it to me and.
But anyone can do that.

2010
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:06,540
My phone just tapped into the database.
Yeah.

2011
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:11,640
So that's some,
that's a threshold we've crossed in the 

2012
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:17,820
last decade or so where basically the 
sum total of human knowledge is right 

2013
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:22,621
here.
And that's incredible for 

2014
01:46:22,621 --> 01:46:23,590
transformation,
for creative thinking.

2015
01:46:23,591 --> 01:46:27,040
All of these things.
That's something we've never had before.

2016
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:32,340
That and the conductivity.
The other thing is now there are 7 

2017
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:34,360
billion people or something like that on
the planet.

2018
01:46:34,361 --> 01:46:35,380
Well,
you know,

2019
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:40,870
I don't know what the statistics are,
but 4 billion of them have cell phones,

2020
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:43,330
you know,
so we've creating,

2021
01:46:43,331 --> 01:46:45,120
I mean,
they don't all have smartphones,

2022
01:46:45,130 --> 01:46:50,130
but they got some kind of a cell phone,
so they are tapped into this database 

2023
01:46:50,581 --> 01:46:54,340
and that's making a big difference,
uh,

2024
01:46:54,490 --> 01:46:55,950
in the way that,
uh,

2025
01:46:55,980 --> 01:47:00,980
you know,
formerly disenfranchised populations 

2026
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:00,980
interact.
I mean,

2027
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:06,020
you know,
you're a fish farmer and you have some 

2028
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:06,660
fish to sell.
You can go on your cell phone and say,

2029
01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:07,290
Oh,
well,

2030
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:08,950
you know,
if I go to this village here,

2031
01:47:08,951 --> 01:47:11,880
I'll get a better price for that,
a trivial thing.

2032
01:47:11,881 --> 01:47:16,881
But in fact that decision affects 
commerce on a global scale if enough 

2033
01:47:17,071 --> 01:47:18,960
people are tapped into that.

2034
01:47:21,740 --> 01:47:26,740
Anyway,
your brother was obsessed with December 

2035
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:28,901
20,
first 2012 being some sort of a 

2036
01:47:28,901 --> 01:47:29,780
transformative moment in our history.
And uh,

2037
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:34,100
a lot of people were me included.
I guess we can put that one to rest,

2038
01:47:34,101 --> 01:47:36,200
I guess.
Can we.

2039
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:41,500
That's,
that's one of the things that I've been 

2040
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:41,500
thinking.
Oh yeah,

2041
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:41,500
yes,
as a specific day.

2042
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:45,700
But if you really look at like the 
tipping point of technological 

2043
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:49,040
technology and our connectivity and you 
know,

2044
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:54,520
that's kind of where it is,
whether it's 2008 or 2012 when you're 

2045
01:47:55,161 --> 01:47:57,980
looking at a thousand years from now,
when they talk about the renaissance,

2046
01:47:58,180 --> 01:47:59,240
you know,
when they talk about,

2047
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:00,110
uh,
you know,

2048
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:02,270
what,
whatever great periods of,

2049
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:07,300
of human history,
whenever a very gigantic periods of 

2050
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:11,471
change,
this is going to be one of the biggest 

2051
01:48:11,471 --> 01:48:11,471
ever.
And it really,

2052
01:48:11,471 --> 01:48:15,900
really will boil down to these decades.
Are these at least these few years.

2053
01:48:16,730 --> 01:48:18,920
So his,
his error,

2054
01:48:18,921 --> 01:48:22,950
I thought as I was kind of a critic of 
the timewave for exactly this I,

2055
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:25,760
but for folks who don't know,
explain what that means,

2056
01:48:25,761 --> 01:48:30,761
that's his,
his idea that he created a mathematical 

2057
01:48:30,761 --> 01:48:35,021
model based on each thing that he 
claimed a describe the structure of 

2058
01:48:35,021 --> 01:48:35,690
time.
I mean,

2059
01:48:35,691 --> 01:48:40,691
he postulated that time had to structure
and time had an end or at least history 

2060
01:48:40,851 --> 01:48:44,180
had a damned and that that end was 
December 20,

2061
01:48:44,181 --> 01:48:45,940
first 2012.
And there's a,

2062
01:48:45,941 --> 01:48:49,130
you know,
a linkages to the Mayan calendar which

2063
01:48:50,860 --> 01:48:53,930
supposedly said similar things.
It was,

2064
01:48:54,410 --> 01:48:57,790
it was a mistake to link it to a 
particular day.

2065
01:48:57,791 --> 01:49:02,791
I think that's not the way that novelty,
the idea was that this wave described 

2066
01:49:02,791 --> 01:49:06,730
the way that novelty in grest into the 
continuum.

2067
01:49:06,731 --> 01:49:11,731
Well,
I think that novelty ingressives in the 

2068
01:49:11,731 --> 01:49:14,521
continuum.
I mean everyday there's something new 

2069
01:49:14,521 --> 01:49:17,281
under the sun.
There is something that never happened 

2070
01:49:17,281 --> 01:49:17,590
before in the history of the universe.
It happens,

2071
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:20,800
but it doesn't explode into the 
continuum.

2072
01:49:20,801 --> 01:49:23,220
It more like it seeps into the 
continuum.

2073
01:49:23,740 --> 01:49:26,800
But change does happen.
And uh,

2074
01:49:27,190 --> 01:49:30,610
we're going through a,
a period of tremendous change,

2075
01:49:30,611 --> 01:49:35,611
but it's not linked to a particular day.
So what I say is he was wrong as far as 

2076
01:49:36,191 --> 01:49:39,430
the particulars were concerned.
It wasn't December 20,

2077
01:49:39,431 --> 01:49:44,020
first 2012,
but he was totally right in terms of the

2078
01:49:44,021 --> 01:49:49,021
idea that novelty does increase and it 
has increased and it's increased,

2079
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:53,200
it's increasing them,
it's accelerating.

2080
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:56,590
And all you have to do is look around,
you know,

2081
01:49:56,591 --> 01:49:58,330
and he was clearly right.
I mean,

2082
01:49:58,331 --> 01:50:02,890
if you look at where we are now,
even from where we were 10 years ago and

2083
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:07,920
even 20 years,
can any of us even remember what it was 

2084
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:08,260
like 20 years ago?
You know,

2085
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:10,570
I mean,
the world has completely transformed.

2086
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,750
Yeah.
So he was correct in that sense,

2087
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:14,300
you know,
that,

2088
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:15,340
that,
uh,

2089
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:16,660
that,
you know,

2090
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:21,870
things are changing and well maybe in 
just putting a date to it and giving 

2091
01:50:21,870 --> 01:50:26,041
people something to focus on,
he made the idea more tangible for some.

2092
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:29,410
It made it more tangible.
But I think it wasn't,

2093
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:34,440
I think it was a,
not necessarily a good strategy because 

2094
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:40,330
it,
it people were giving into the 

2095
01:50:40,330 --> 01:50:43,150
temptation of focusing on that date and 
it was either on that date,

2096
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:45,400
either everything's going to collapse 
or,

2097
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:49,090
or we'll cross the threshold and 
everything will be great.

2098
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:50,780
And it was kind of a,
you know,

2099
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:54,100
consciousness will be transformed and 
won't be in this golden state.

2100
01:50:54,101 --> 01:50:56,080
And I,
I thought it was kind of a,

2101
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,800
uh,
for many people it was an excuse for not

2102
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:02,460
taking responsibility.
I mean it and,

2103
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:07,270
and just all we have to do is wait.
And then it'll all workout.

2104
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:08,410
No,
you know,

2105
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:12,730
that's not taking responsibility.
We've got to get cracking now.

2106
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,740
We can't wait.
We can't wait.

2107
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:18,550
So now that it didn't happen.
So the message is the same.

2108
01:51:18,551 --> 01:51:21,850
We've got to get cracking and we can 
relax.

2109
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:24,580
Okay.
The aliens didn't land.

2110
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:28,000
No wormholes appeared before our eyes.
Yeah.

2111
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:33,570
None of that happened,
but it doesn't mean that things aren't 

2112
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:34,210
happening and you know,
uh,

2113
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:39,190
to make things make change,
I think happened quietly,

2114
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:40,930
you know,
they're not noticed.

2115
01:51:40,931 --> 01:51:45,931
They're not tremendous with,
with obvious exceptions like a global 

2116
01:51:47,621 --> 01:51:48,820
asteroid impact.

2117
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:49,390
I mean,
hey,

2118
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:52,780
that's abrupt and it's transforming,
no doubt.

2119
01:51:52,781 --> 01:51:55,690
But that only happens once every few 
million years.

2120
01:51:55,980 --> 01:52:00,980
Uh,
events normally don't explode into 

2121
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:00,980
history that way.
I mean,

2122
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:03,000
tariffs used to talk about the,
you know,

2123
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:06,640
the explode,
the first explosion of the atomic bomb,

2124
01:52:07,180 --> 01:52:07,930
you know,
well,

2125
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:10,300
that was an abrupt event,
but not really.

2126
01:52:10,301 --> 01:52:10,720
I mean,
the.

2127
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:16,020
When did the actual novelty take place?
Was it when Einstein developed the 

2128
01:52:16,691 --> 01:52:21,691
equations that describe nuclear fusion?
Or was it the fishing rather?

2129
01:52:21,821 --> 01:52:24,580
Or was it the point where,
uh,

2130
01:52:24,581 --> 01:52:29,581
you know,
we achieved the first sustained nuclear 

2131
01:52:29,581 --> 01:52:29,581
reaction.
I mean,

2132
01:52:29,581 --> 01:52:31,120
these were not things that anybody 
noticed at the time,

2133
01:52:31,210 --> 01:52:36,130
but those were the transformative events
that made it possible to,

2134
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:41,160
a couple decades later,
dropped the atomic uttama on the atom 

2135
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:41,560
bomb on Hiroshima,
you know,

2136
01:52:41,610 --> 01:52:43,330
and that's the one that got the 
headlights,

2137
01:52:43,331 --> 01:52:45,950
but that wasn't really the roots of the 
novelty,

2138
01:52:45,951 --> 01:52:46,850
if you know what I'm saying.

2139
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:47,440
Yeah,
no,

2140
01:52:47,441 --> 01:52:52,441
I totally know what you're saying.
And it seems that they're all pile onto 

2141
01:52:52,441 --> 01:52:55,350
each other as well,
pile onto each other and they're 

2142
01:52:55,350 --> 01:52:55,350
cumulative.
Exactly.

2143
01:52:55,350 --> 01:52:58,120
And we haven't even started,
most likely.

2144
01:52:58,150 --> 01:52:59,350
No,
we haven't started.

2145
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:04,560
Which is why the concept of an alien 
invasion seems so ridiculous to us based

2146
01:53:05,111 --> 01:53:07,930
on our current capabilities,
but so inevitable.

2147
01:53:07,931 --> 01:53:12,931
When you think about the fact that we've
got robots wandering around on Mars 

2148
01:53:12,931 --> 01:53:13,030
right now as we speak.
I mean,

2149
01:53:13,390 --> 01:53:15,880
what would we,
where would we think we're going to do?

2150
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:17,470
I mean,
what we do,

2151
01:53:17,590 --> 01:53:20,560
the most spectacular thing we do,
we have two things we do.

2152
01:53:20,770 --> 01:53:25,770
We blow shit up and we explore space.
Those are the two things that gathered 

2153
01:53:25,781 --> 01:53:26,790
the most attention,
right?

2154
01:53:27,010 --> 01:53:27,790
You know,
we can,

2155
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:32,820
we can blow up a city or we can send a 
robot to wander around on Mars and send 

2156
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:35,320
back videos and you're like,
Holy Shit,

2157
01:53:35,321 --> 01:53:39,910
those are the two very distinctly 
different.

2158
01:53:39,911 --> 01:53:43,700
But this exemplify the limit

2159
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:44,900
higher power.
Yeah.

2160
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:49,901
We have the power to completely disrupt 
the whole shooting match and just,

2161
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:55,420
it all turns into radioactive slag or we
escaped some way and I think,

2162
01:53:55,941 --> 01:53:56,900
uh,
you know,

2163
01:53:56,901 --> 01:54:01,070
I think it's wonderful that we can send 
robots to Maurice and all this,

2164
01:54:01,071 --> 01:54:06,071
but space is so fast.
It's never really gonna become 

2165
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:11,690
accessible to us unless we can figure 
out this hyper light thing.

2166
01:54:11,691 --> 01:54:16,691
And I don't know if it's traveling the 
traveling faster than light or figuring 

2167
01:54:17,121 --> 01:54:19,400
out how to open up a portal.
I mean,

2168
01:54:19,401 --> 01:54:20,930
this idea that,
you know,

2169
01:54:21,050 --> 01:54:24,770
there's Tony Newtonian space separated 
by this vast distances.

2170
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:29,860
I don't buy it.
I think there's a way to get from one 

2171
01:54:30,091 --> 01:54:35,091
place to another without going through 
new to hyperspace as a real thing.

2172
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:37,490
Well,
it might get down to,

2173
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:42,530
to learn how to navigate it.
It might get down to we just have to be 

2174
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:46,550
stopped being carbon based life forms.
It might know that made it real space 

2175
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:47,120
travel.
Right.

2176
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:49,760
It may end up that way too.
When you,

2177
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:54,860
when you look at the possibility that 
dimethyltryptamine and similar 

2178
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:59,571
psychedelics are a gateway to,
to some other thing,

2179
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:04,700
whether it's another dimension and the 
state of being another access to a part 

2180
01:55:05,041 --> 01:55:06,530
of the mind that,
that doesn't,

2181
01:55:06,570 --> 01:55:09,150
doesn't exist.
Do you think that,

2182
01:55:09,151 --> 01:55:11,130
that.
Is that.

2183
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:15,000
Is that something that I'm trying to 
figure out how to say this,

2184
01:55:15,001 --> 01:55:20,001
but is that something that is like,
it's going to take a long time before 

2185
01:55:21,631 --> 01:55:26,631
that's something that you could pass off
to other folks that haven't experienced 

2186
01:55:26,631 --> 01:55:28,620
that and have them accept it and is 
there a bridge to sort of,

2187
01:55:28,621 --> 01:55:31,260
uh,
getting them to consider these ideas?

2188
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:36,710
Well,
I really,

2189
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:37,910
I,
I don't know.

2190
01:55:37,911 --> 01:55:40,820
I mean the bridge,
the most convincing thing is,

2191
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:41,530
you know,
here's,

2192
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:43,620
here's the pipe,
smoke the pipe.

2193
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:47,040
You don't need me to tell you.
As you mentioned before,

2194
01:55:47,041 --> 01:55:52,041
and it's quite true.
One of the beautiful things about 

2195
01:55:52,041 --> 01:55:52,290
psychedelics is you don't have to have 
faith,

2196
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:55,590
all you have to have is courage.
You know,

2197
01:55:55,591 --> 01:56:00,591
you have to have enough courage to sit 
down and put that pipe to your lips and 

2198
01:56:00,591 --> 01:56:04,410
you know,
we can get beyond this conversation very

2199
01:56:04,411 --> 01:56:05,270
quick.
Yes.

2200
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:09,360
Then we can have the real conversation 
about what is all that mean,

2201
01:56:09,361 --> 01:56:12,270
what did,
what happened and what is the real,

2202
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:13,920
what happened?
Are We,

2203
01:56:14,350 --> 01:56:19,350
you know,
are you a tapping into some external,

2204
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:20,820
again,
these,

2205
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:24,590
these ridiculous words that are 
dualistic,

2206
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:25,860
enhance,
you know,

2207
01:56:25,861 --> 01:56:30,861
but are you tapping into some dimension 
that is not part of you or is it,

2208
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:34,570
or are you looking at a,
you know,

2209
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:39,510
a certain neurochemical brain state that
has,

2210
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:44,690
that doesn't go beyond that.
And then it's like we can fall back on 

2211
01:56:44,690 --> 01:56:48,981
what we were saying.
Everything you experienced isn't 

2212
01:56:48,981 --> 01:56:48,981
neurochemical brain state,
right?

2213
01:56:48,981 --> 01:56:51,630
That's what we are.
That's what our brain does.

2214
01:56:52,190 --> 01:56:52,690
Um,

2215
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:57,850
so do you define it yourself?
Like when you,

2216
01:56:57,851 --> 01:56:59,550
when you do it,
what do you think is happening?

2217
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:02,410
DMT,
which is the most profound one

2218
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:06,320
I think.
Well,

2219
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:09,110
it's,
you know,

2220
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:12,340
the problem with psychedelics,
one of the,

2221
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:17,460
one of the problems that we experienced 
with psychedelics is they are 

2222
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:21,421
essentially an English language bull.
They're beyond language and you take dmt

2223
01:57:22,761 --> 01:57:26,210
or something like that has such a 
profound impact.

2224
01:57:26,211 --> 01:57:28,250
I mean,
you probably noticed it in yourself.

2225
01:57:29,390 --> 01:57:33,140
You're not even down from the experience
before.

2226
01:57:33,141 --> 01:57:38,090
You're trying to box it into some kind 
of a linguistic box that's,

2227
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:43,300
you know,
and you're reaching out and you're 

2228
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:43,300
babbling and then you're say that it,
that's it.

2229
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:43,820
Or my God,
my God,

2230
01:57:43,821 --> 01:57:48,821
or you know,
but you're trying to put it into some 

2231
01:57:48,821 --> 01:57:51,200
kind of a linguistic box because.
Because it's in comprehensible by nature

2232
01:57:51,201 --> 01:57:56,201
it seemed comprehensible.
It's like trying to describe what God 

2233
01:57:56,201 --> 01:57:59,840
looks like it is by definition 
undescribable and so,

2234
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:03,890
but our brain wants to conceptualize 
things.

2235
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,480
So,
uh,

2236
01:58:05,570 --> 01:58:08,240
so whatever model you create of what it 
is,

2237
01:58:08,241 --> 01:58:10,280
that's not it,
that's not the thing.

2238
01:58:10,281 --> 01:58:12,710
It's not what you experienced.
It's a memory of,

2239
01:58:12,770 --> 01:58:16,220
of what,
of what you experienced.

2240
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:18,860
And uh,
uh,

2241
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:24,760
I don't know how you get around that,
you know,

2242
01:58:24,981 --> 01:58:26,770
I think that,
um,

2243
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:30,640
well,

2244
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:35,700
I don't know.
It seems even exploring the concept 

2245
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:36,880
itself is almost impossible without the 
experience almost

2246
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:38,010
possible.
I mean it,

2247
01:58:38,370 --> 01:58:40,560
I mean,
so you're asking me to a supply,

2248
01:58:40,561 --> 01:58:42,610
a description.

2249
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:49,140
So I,
with the caveat that any linguistic 

2250
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:53,281
description is going to be an adequate,
I would say a lot of what my impressions

2251
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:58,890
of DMT are.
The most profound experiences are it 

2252
01:58:58,890 --> 01:59:01,240
strips away.
You get to see the raw data,

2253
01:59:02,050 --> 01:59:06,810
the raw data of experience in the 
unprocessed for,

2254
01:59:06,850 --> 01:59:11,850
you know,
how we were talking about how the brain 

2255
01:59:11,850 --> 01:59:12,070
takes experience and,
and you know,

2256
01:59:12,190 --> 01:59:17,190
puts it all together into some kind of a
more or less comprehensible model.

2257
01:59:17,561 --> 01:59:21,370
And extrudes out has,
as you know,

2258
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:23,350
your reality,
your movie,

2259
01:59:23,351 --> 01:59:27,730
the movie that your producer,
director and star of and uh,

2260
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:32,620
it does that dmt gives you a chance to 
kind of arrest that process.

2261
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,180
And again,
as I said,

2262
01:59:34,181 --> 01:59:36,670
step back from it and look at the raw 
data,

2263
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:41,700
look at the circuitry underneath free of
interpretation and say,

2264
01:59:43,210 --> 01:59:44,470
Oh,
okay,

2265
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:47,200
this is the,
this is the machinery.

2266
01:59:47,201 --> 01:59:49,870
This is the machinery that generating 
reality.

2267
01:59:50,620 --> 01:59:55,620
But again,
by even saying that I don't do it 

2268
01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:55,620
justice.
I mean it's,

2269
01:59:55,620 --> 01:59:56,900
it's slippery obviously it's a slippery 
cock onset

2270
01:59:57,210 --> 01:59:58,830
intensely,
intensely,

2271
01:59:58,860 --> 02:00:01,670
and I,
I've always wondered like what is the,

2272
02:00:01,950 --> 02:00:06,950
if there is a way to describe it to 
someone who hasn't experienced and I 

2273
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:06,950
don't think,
I think there is,

2274
02:00:06,990 --> 02:00:09,690
and even to those of us who have 
experienced it,

2275
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:14,720
you can't describe it after my memory,
I had been tricked,

2276
02:00:15,690 --> 02:00:19,650
like that's not anything like Terence 
Mckenna or Dennis Mckenna described it.

2277
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:21,330
What did,
what was your experience like?

2278
02:00:21,420 --> 02:00:24,420
No self transforming machine elves.
Well,

2279
02:00:24,421 --> 02:00:27,390
I'm thinking of of my first mushroom 
experience,

2280
02:00:27,391 --> 02:00:32,391
but now my first dmt experience was.
I mean it sounds trivial,

2281
02:00:33,211 --> 02:00:38,211
but it was sort of like some sort of 
gingerbread or play dough that was alive

2282
02:00:38,641 --> 02:00:43,410
and talking to me and just sort of one 
aspect of the godhead.

2283
02:00:43,630 --> 02:00:47,050
Just sort of gingerbread or playdough.
Yeah,

2284
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:52,120
it was sort of like alive gingerbread 
people I guess way it didn't look like 

2285
02:00:53,851 --> 02:00:54,580
an Elf but it.

2286
02:00:54,620 --> 02:00:56,580
And it kind of had that,
that aspect.

2287
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:59,520
Yeah.
It certainly felt alive like it had been

2288
02:00:59,521 --> 02:01:01,120
waiting for me.
Yeah.

2289
02:01:01,150 --> 02:01:03,660
That's the weird thing to see me.
Yeah.

2290
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:08,280
The weird one is the friendliness of it,
but I felt dead.

2291
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:11,190
That was my overwhelming feeling was,
oh no,

2292
02:01:11,191 --> 02:01:14,160
I've really done it.
But in the back of my mind I knew that I

2293
02:01:14,161 --> 02:01:19,161
was coming back.
I was still sitting in my chair and 

2294
02:01:19,161 --> 02:01:23,271
before I knew it,
it was over and I was Doug Stan hope 

2295
02:01:23,271 --> 02:01:23,271
who's a good friend of mine is a stand 
up comedian.

2296
02:01:23,370 --> 02:01:26,220
Did a dmt with me the first time you 
ever did it.

2297
02:01:26,221 --> 02:01:29,940
I had them over my house and he went 
into convulsions,

2298
02:01:29,941 --> 02:01:34,240
which I've never seen before.
And W five meo and um,

2299
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:35,610
he,
yeah,

2300
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:38,880
he started moaning and foaming at the 
mouth,

2301
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:40,240
like he was,
like,

2302
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:41,980
drool is coming out his mouth and he was
going,

2303
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:47,020
oh.
And I was thinking of the Qti from this 

2304
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:50,711
shit.
I've never heard of anybody that's 

2305
02:01:50,711 --> 02:01:50,711
fucked.
I just killed my friend.

2306
02:01:50,711 --> 02:01:51,680
Damn.
How am I gonna explain this.

2307
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:54,500
And um,
I've never,

2308
02:01:54,501 --> 02:01:56,190
I've never seen anybody have that one

2309
02:01:56,230 --> 02:01:59,140
experience before or since.
And uh,

2310
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:00,490
it was weird.
It was,

2311
02:02:00,820 --> 02:02:02,830
he was moaning,
it was a big dose.

2312
02:02:02,831 --> 02:02:05,950
He took a big dose and uh,
you know,

2313
02:02:05,951 --> 02:02:10,450
when he came back just for just filled 
with descriptions that were inadequate,

2314
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:11,920
you know,
which we all are,

2315
02:02:12,730 --> 02:02:17,730
but a five methoxy is even trickier.
DMT,

2316
02:02:17,921 --> 02:02:22,921
I don't know.
I mean I've had very limited experience 

2317
02:02:22,921 --> 02:02:26,320
with firefox seat because it's too much.
Yeah,

2318
02:02:26,321 --> 02:02:28,810
I didn't,
I didn't think I was coming back.

2319
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:34,320
That's my baby.
That's exactly the one we should be 

2320
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:34,510
looking into.
I mean,

2321
02:02:34,570 --> 02:02:35,440
I,
you know,

2322
02:02:35,590 --> 02:02:40,590
but it has more issues with toxicity and
all that and to uh,

2323
02:02:41,830 --> 02:02:44,830
but it's definitely puts you in this,
uh,

2324
02:02:44,890 --> 02:02:46,280
in this place to eat.
You know,

2325
02:02:46,390 --> 02:02:50,560
James horrocks book the trip to me 
palace.

2326
02:02:50,590 --> 02:02:51,580
No.
Oh,

2327
02:02:51,910 --> 02:02:56,910
you should.
You might want to get him on this show 

2328
02:02:56,910 --> 02:02:56,910
palace.
James Orac.

2329
02:02:56,910 --> 02:02:56,950
How do you spell it?

2330
02:02:57,650 --> 02:02:59,360
Oh,
R o

2331
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:04,400
I see.
I believe five methoxy DM.

2332
02:03:04,870 --> 02:03:08,280
This is all about 5:00
ctmt that's this whole book.

2333
02:03:08,330 --> 02:03:12,120
Yeah.
And he says you think DMT is something?

2334
02:03:12,210 --> 02:03:17,210
Five methoxy is where it's really at.
And I can't dispute that because frankly

2335
02:03:19,621 --> 02:03:20,490
it scares the shit out.

2336
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:24,640
It did.
It was different for me because,

2337
02:03:24,641 --> 02:03:29,641
um,
it didn't give me the sort of comfort 

2338
02:03:29,641 --> 02:03:32,491
that dmt did,
that it was sort of talking to me and 

2339
02:03:32,491 --> 02:03:34,120
communicating with me.
It was completely absent of any context.

2340
02:03:34,121 --> 02:03:35,170
It was impossible

2341
02:03:35,690 --> 02:03:37,100
play it.
That's what it was.

2342
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:39,200
There were no,
no friendly Elfin,

2343
02:03:39,640 --> 02:03:42,140
no gingerbread people,
no machines,

2344
02:03:42,141 --> 02:03:43,790
no nothing like that.
It was like,

2345
02:03:43,791 --> 02:03:44,960
you were,
you were.

2346
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:50,500
My apprehension was that was that I was 
part of this oort cloud of souls.

2347
02:03:52,071 --> 02:03:57,071
I was a part of this somewhere somewhere
if there's a place where all conscious 

2348
02:03:57,441 --> 02:04:02,441
entities arose from and go back to and I
was in the center of this galactic cloud

2349
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:07,130
of,
of being,

2350
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:08,020
you know,
um,

2351
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:13,270
I mean I sort of had that diem awareness
of my existence as a separate entity,

2352
02:04:13,971 --> 02:04:16,760
but mostly I was part of this,
the soul

2353
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:21,030
all out and a is the best I can describe
it,

2354
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:25,140
you know.
And by the time I came back,

2355
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:27,590
uh,
you know,

2356
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:32,600
that was,
that was all completely faded as it 

2357
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:32,600
tended to.
That was,

2358
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:32,600
that was,
uh,

2359
02:04:33,990 --> 02:04:38,990
that was 20 years ago that I had that 
experience and still resonating with me.

2360
02:04:39,331 --> 02:04:40,320
I haven't done it.
Sam.

2361
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:45,710
Yeah.
I've only had it a few times and I 

2362
02:04:45,710 --> 02:04:45,710
didn't want to go back again.
I was like,

2363
02:04:45,710 --> 02:04:45,960
ah,
I got it.

2364
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:48,990
I got that.
Whereas the on any time,

2365
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:54,000
ethel trip to mean was a,
it was different every time and it 

2366
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,490
seemed like it was a communication,
like something was talking to me.

2367
02:04:56,491 --> 02:05:01,491
Like there was a lot going on.
The visual aspect of it was way more 

2368
02:05:01,491 --> 02:05:01,491
compelling.
Yeah.

2369
02:05:01,491 --> 02:05:04,650
I did very little visual aspect with 
foxy was just white.

2370
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:06,770
Yeah.
It was like,

2371
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:10,670
it felt like I wasn't,
I didn't have a consciousness anymore is

2372
02:05:10,671 --> 02:05:13,370
the only thing that I've ever done that 
seemed to eliminate consciousness.

2373
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:15,420
It wasn't,
didn't matter.

2374
02:05:15,450 --> 02:05:20,450
Like the vaguely aware the Dolly aware 
of the fact that you exist at all was 

2375
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:22,800
one of the more terrifying aspects of 
it.

2376
02:05:22,801 --> 02:05:23,220
It's like,
oh,

2377
02:05:23,221 --> 02:05:24,690
this is probably what happens when you 
die.

2378
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:30,200
When you die,
you probably go into this thing and 

2379
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:31,910
become whatever part of this cloud you 
are

2380
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:36,560
community of over souls,
which is every conscious being that ever

2381
02:05:36,561 --> 02:05:38,570
existed anywhere in the universe.

2382
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:44,020
It also gave me the most tangible 
feeling of there not being an up and 

2383
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:45,210
then not being in down.
There's no laugh.

2384
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:48,290
There is no right or as the whole thing,
you know,

2385
02:05:48,291 --> 02:05:52,640
and then you're part of the whole thing 
and it just goes everywhere.

2386
02:05:52,641 --> 02:05:54,110
It doesn't,
you're not in the middle,

2387
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:56,330
you're not in the center,
you're not in the left,

2388
02:05:56,360 --> 02:05:59,180
not to the right.
It's just show the whole thing,

2389
02:05:59,690 --> 02:06:00,570
you know,
and you know,

2390
02:06:00,710 --> 02:06:01,980
it's an illusion.
And that,

2391
02:06:01,990 --> 02:06:06,990
that was the weird aspect of the planets
were an illusion that everything's a 

2392
02:06:06,990 --> 02:06:08,060
little wind,
all of it.

2393
02:06:08,061 --> 02:06:10,130
Nonsense.
You're just a part of the whole,

2394
02:06:10,131 --> 02:06:13,460
when you get down to the lowest thing,
you're a part of the whole soup.

2395
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:14,200
Yup.

2396
02:06:14,740 --> 02:06:16,330
Yup.
He thought that drug,

2397
02:06:16,331 --> 02:06:21,331
he refers to a zero energy point feel,
uh,

2398
02:06:22,390 --> 02:06:23,530
which uh,
yeah,

2399
02:06:23,531 --> 02:06:28,360
I mean that's a definitely a,
a worth putting on your map.

2400
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:31,600
And if you're brave enough or foolish 
enough,

2401
02:06:31,601 --> 02:06:34,100
it's probably worth exploring.
But I'm,

2402
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:36,340
I'm too old for that shit.

2403
02:06:36,430 --> 02:06:36,630
Right.

2404
02:06:43,190 --> 02:06:48,190
My friend Duncan took it and he took a 
huge dose because he didn't believe it 

2405
02:06:48,190 --> 02:06:51,601
was.
He had never done any dmt before and he 

2406
02:06:51,601 --> 02:06:51,601
had done acid and I had never done acid 
before.

2407
02:06:51,601 --> 02:06:54,290
And I was telling him about dmts.
I even ever even done acid.

2408
02:06:54,530 --> 02:06:59,530
So he takes a,
he takes dmt in a big dose and he calls 

2409
02:06:59,530 --> 02:06:59,530
me up.
He's like,

2410
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:01,760
what the fuck man?
I'm like,

2411
02:07:01,761 --> 02:07:03,020
I told you like,
no,

2412
02:07:03,021 --> 02:07:04,820
he didn't tell me.
You kind of told me,

2413
02:07:04,821 --> 02:07:06,040
but I didn't listen.
Right.

2414
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:09,320
Holy Shit.
Like he was convinced that he died.

2415
02:07:09,321 --> 02:07:12,080
He was a believer.
Oh boy.

2416
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:13,910
Was he ever.
Yeah.

2417
02:07:14,020 --> 02:07:15,260
Yeah.
It was a,

2418
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:18,590
you know,
it's a very disturbing.

2419
02:07:18,591 --> 02:07:23,591
But again,
impossible to ignore transcendent 

2420
02:07:23,591 --> 02:07:23,591
experience.
You know,

2421
02:07:23,591 --> 02:07:27,160
it is.
I think Salvia divinorum can take a 

2422
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:27,590
person to a similar space,
sort of.

2423
02:07:27,820 --> 02:07:32,820
You feel that you're,
you're no longer a point of 

2424
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:34,100
consciousness except it,
it doesn't feel like a cloud.

2425
02:07:34,101 --> 02:07:36,190
It feels like a Mexican dance party

2426
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:40,780
or geometric thing,
isn't it?

2427
02:07:40,781 --> 02:07:45,781
Because it slipped through that Salvia 
slip through and it took a while before 

2428
02:07:45,851 --> 02:07:50,851
people realize that slipped through.
You mean legally speaking through 

2429
02:07:50,851 --> 02:07:53,860
because it's,
its own best insurance against abuse.

2430
02:07:55,110 --> 02:07:57,370
Most people are like,
once there's enough,

2431
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:01,270
never again,
one of these ones like five.

2432
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:02,470
See,
I mean most,

2433
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:07,800
some people do seem to be fascinated by 
it and they keep going back to it and,

2434
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:15,220
but most people find it very disturbing 
and not,

2435
02:08:15,380 --> 02:08:18,640
not particularly enjoyable and actually 
just,

2436
02:08:18,970 --> 02:08:22,480
just bizarro no.
But again,

2437
02:08:22,481 --> 02:08:23,910
these are areas,
uh,

2438
02:08:23,911 --> 02:08:28,090
of consciousness.
These pharmacological tools are,

2439
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:28,960
are,
uh,

2440
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:34,060
you know,
their exploratory probes into these 

2441
02:08:34,060 --> 02:08:37,230
realms of consciousness.
And just because you're familiar with 

2442
02:08:37,230 --> 02:08:41,250
the psychedelic experience,
which is mainly the tryptamine mediated 

2443
02:08:41,250 --> 02:08:41,890
Serotonin,
you know,

2444
02:08:41,891 --> 02:08:46,891
dimension there all those other 
dimensions out there and are aspects of 

2445
02:08:46,891 --> 02:08:50,940
consciousness to Salvia divinorum 
happens to be the kappa opiates.

2446
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:53,590
You know,
it's a kappa opioid like end.

2447
02:08:53,591 --> 02:08:55,960
It's very selective for,
you know,

2448
02:08:56,080 --> 02:09:00,430
we don't think of opiates is going to 
those places,

2449
02:09:00,431 --> 02:09:01,920
you know,
heroin and morphine,

2450
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:04,120
those sorts of things.
They're euphoric,

2451
02:09:04,121 --> 02:09:05,700
gentle,
you know,

2452
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:09,730
almost sedated states of mind kappa OPA 
eight,

2453
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:10,800
which is,
you know,

2454
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:15,810
one of the three opiate receptors that 
happens to be the one that's Salvia 

2455
02:09:15,810 --> 02:09:16,300
divinorum exists.

2456
02:09:16,690 --> 02:09:18,880
It's a whole other ballgame,
you know,

2457
02:09:18,881 --> 02:09:21,340
I mean,
it's not a,

2458
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:25,660
certainly not anything that anyone would
seek out,

2459
02:09:25,780 --> 02:09:27,340
you know,
certainly not addictive,

2460
02:09:27,370 --> 02:09:32,370
but so that realm of consciousness is 
mediated by that whole network.

2461
02:09:33,820 --> 02:09:36,630
If you look at a,
the tourist,

2462
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:41,640
the night shades,
the anticholinergics that's working on 

2463
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:43,420
Acetylcholine,
Acetylcholine blockers,

2464
02:09:43,421 --> 02:09:46,600
so that's a whole other neurotransmitter
system.

2465
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:49,830
And if you look into,
you know,

2466
02:09:49,930 --> 02:09:54,930
the,
I may have a long history of use 

2467
02:09:54,930 --> 02:09:54,930
obviously,
and they seem to be,

2468
02:09:55,360 --> 02:10:00,360
if you look into the use of tollway in 
South America to weigh a brick band,

2469
02:10:01,201 --> 02:10:04,720
cea,
or you look at detour for another night,

2470
02:10:04,721 --> 02:10:09,721
shades in Europe.
This is the realm of race and ghosts and

2471
02:10:12,070 --> 02:10:13,090
that sort of thing.

2472
02:10:14,740 --> 02:10:17,520
Detour is a very interesting one too,
because of the,

2473
02:10:17,521 --> 02:10:22,521
uh,
the reality desolving properties of it 

2474
02:10:22,521 --> 02:10:23,340
where people think that there's 
somewhere that they're not,

2475
02:10:23,370 --> 02:10:28,370
and they have huge issues with memory.
You think that's the disruption of 

2476
02:10:28,370 --> 02:10:29,010
Acetylcholine?
Well,

2477
02:10:29,070 --> 02:10:29,820
yeah,
it does,

2478
02:10:29,910 --> 02:10:34,070
it does disrupt memory.
We know that Acetylcholine has a lot to

2479
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:36,910
do with the entrainment of memory and 
detour,

2480
02:10:37,380 --> 02:10:38,900
detour.
It disrupts that.

2481
02:10:39,950 --> 02:10:44,950
So it's hard to remember the state,
which is probably a good thing because 

2482
02:10:44,950 --> 02:10:46,910
the states are really bizarre.
Um,

2483
02:10:47,870 --> 02:10:52,870
I tell people detour it a night shade.
Detour is not a psychedelic,

2484
02:10:53,991 --> 02:10:58,991
but it's a true hallucinogen in the 
sense that it's not a psychedelic state,

2485
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:03,620
but you have hallucinations.
The problem is you can't tell if they're

2486
02:11:03,621 --> 02:11:06,800
real or not.
Usually a psychedelic hallucination,

2487
02:11:06,801 --> 02:11:08,030
you know,
it's not real.

2488
02:11:08,031 --> 02:11:10,160
You may be seeing something that's not 
there,

2489
02:11:10,820 --> 02:11:14,530
but there's a part of your mind that's 
saying this is a hallucination year.

2490
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:15,950
It's not there.
You know,

2491
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:21,400
you see things on detour.
You don't know if they're there or not 

2492
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:21,560
there,
you know,

2493
02:11:21,820 --> 02:11:22,700
you,
you,

2494
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:24,980
if I could,
I could have a hallucination.

2495
02:11:24,981 --> 02:11:29,981
I'm sitting across from you talking and 
you see ms dot real and solid as you do 

2496
02:11:30,771 --> 02:11:31,370
now.

2497
02:11:32,150 --> 02:11:34,010
You know,
but you're not there.

2498
02:11:34,610 --> 02:11:39,610
I'm having a conversation with you and 
then you sort of just fade away like 

2499
02:11:39,610 --> 02:11:40,970
kind of a wraith,
you know,

2500
02:11:40,971 --> 02:11:42,230
you sort of.
I'm like,

2501
02:11:42,231 --> 02:11:44,660
what the fuck?
Where did you go?

2502
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:46,910
Is that what has happened to you have,
you know,

2503
02:11:46,911 --> 02:11:49,760
that's what happens.
What happened to you when you did it?

2504
02:11:50,330 --> 02:11:52,070
That's what happened.
Like you were talking to someone.

2505
02:11:52,071 --> 02:11:53,690
They were.
They literally didn't exist.

2506
02:11:53,691 --> 02:11:54,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

2507
02:11:54,350 --> 02:11:54,820
Well,
I,

2508
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:58,070
I took a detour.
I described this in my book.

2509
02:11:58,071 --> 02:11:59,780
Actually.
I have old chapter of it,

2510
02:11:59,781 --> 02:12:04,781
a friend of mine and I took a detour up 
when we were 16.

2511
02:12:04,820 --> 02:12:09,820
Not even knowing what it was.
I mean this is how clueless we were at 

2512
02:12:09,820 --> 02:12:14,321
the time.
I actually thought it was a kind of 

2513
02:12:14,321 --> 02:12:14,321
morning glory.
I,

2514
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:18,590
I had had lsd once in my life and we 
took this detour it.

2515
02:12:18,590 --> 02:12:20,870
I thought it was a different species of 
morning glory.

2516
02:12:20,871 --> 02:12:23,810
So all this stuff began to happen and I 
thought,

2517
02:12:23,811 --> 02:12:26,060
oh,
this is what a bad acid trip is.

2518
02:12:26,061 --> 02:12:27,950
Like wow.
And no,

2519
02:12:27,951 --> 02:12:32,951
it's not what a bad acid trip is like.
It's what a totally typical a detour.

2520
02:12:33,411 --> 02:12:38,411
A trip is like.
And it's characteristic that you see 

2521
02:12:38,411 --> 02:12:42,020
entities,
you see things that are there.

2522
02:12:42,230 --> 02:12:47,230
And uh,
I was an and it was quite anxiety 

2523
02:12:47,230 --> 02:12:49,070
provoking.
And uh,

2524
02:12:49,580 --> 02:12:51,560
my friend,
I was in my bedroom,

2525
02:12:51,561 --> 02:12:53,370
I managed to,
you know,

2526
02:12:53,371 --> 02:12:56,540
you have to read the chapter,
but I finally got to my bedroom,

2527
02:12:56,541 --> 02:13:00,740
I barricaded myself in my bedroom and my
mother was completely freaked out.

2528
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:03,200
What was going on?
I just said,

2529
02:13:03,201 --> 02:13:04,190
mom,
how old,

2530
02:13:04,191 --> 02:13:06,230
you know,
I'll be out in 12 hours.

2531
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:12,770
16.
Oh,

2532
02:13:12,870 --> 02:13:16,820
that's awesome.
And so I'm in the bedroom and one of the

2533
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:21,940
weird things,
I guess people who take detours should 

2534
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:24,971
be for ward.
One of the things that does this dilate 

2535
02:13:24,971 --> 02:13:24,971
your eyes,
right?

2536
02:13:24,971 --> 02:13:28,800
It's used medically to dilate your eyes.
Atrophying is what they put in your eyes

2537
02:13:29,030 --> 02:13:32,220
to do an eye exam.
What means is your

2538
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:35,910
eyes are dilated so you can't see very 
well.

2539
02:13:36,510 --> 02:13:37,510
And,
uh,

2540
02:13:37,530 --> 02:13:41,580
so any modeled surface anything with a 
texture,

2541
02:13:41,670 --> 02:13:46,670
like a table cloth or wallpaper,
anything you're looking at starts to 

2542
02:13:46,670 --> 02:13:49,410
swarm and step.
And the next thing you know,

2543
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:53,070
they're bugs everywhere.
For me.

2544
02:13:53,071 --> 02:13:56,370
So it was like the bug experience.
There were insects,

2545
02:13:56,430 --> 02:13:59,520
all surfaces were covered with these 
swarming,

2546
02:14:00,570 --> 02:14:03,720
you know,
things which were the visual distortions

2547
02:14:03,721 --> 02:14:08,721
of not being able to focus on anything,
but I was totally freaked out by this 

2548
02:14:08,721 --> 02:14:13,341
and,
and so my friends or images of my 

2549
02:14:13,341 --> 02:14:17,601
friends kept appearing at the edge of my
bed at the end of my bed and they would 

2550
02:14:17,601 --> 02:14:19,470
appear and I would say,
help me,

2551
02:14:19,471 --> 02:14:21,570
help me,
get me out of here.

2552
02:14:21,630 --> 02:14:22,530
I'd be,
you know,

2553
02:14:22,710 --> 02:14:25,110
and they would sort of just look at me 
and like,

2554
02:14:25,111 --> 02:14:26,670
you know,
you pour sand,

2555
02:14:28,430 --> 02:14:30,500
shake their head and then just fade 
away.

2556
02:14:31,370 --> 02:14:36,370
That's awesome.
It's fascinating that it has something 

2557
02:14:36,370 --> 02:14:37,310
to do with Acetylcholine.
Yeah.

2558
02:14:37,311 --> 02:14:40,460
Have you ever experimented with taking 
acetylcholine before you go to bed?

2559
02:14:41,090 --> 02:14:42,290
Uh,
I haven't.

2560
02:14:42,490 --> 02:14:47,490
It's,
it gives you the most amazing lucid 

2561
02:14:47,490 --> 02:14:47,490
dreams.
Amazing Dreams.

2562
02:14:47,490 --> 02:14:51,021
I'm not surprised.
Fascinating what I called durable lucid 

2563
02:14:51,021 --> 02:14:51,480
dreams,
right?

2564
02:14:51,650 --> 02:14:54,680
Because I'm not a lucid dream.
I'm like,

2565
02:14:55,140 --> 02:14:57,650
I'm not disciplined in I,
I've never studied it.

2566
02:14:57,651 --> 02:15:02,651
I don't practice it.
Apparently there's techniques that you 

2567
02:15:02,651 --> 02:15:05,261
can,
you can learn how to successfully lucid 

2568
02:15:05,261 --> 02:15:07,880
dream on the Nash as it were,
but if you take acetylcholine before you

2569
02:15:07,881 --> 02:15:12,881
go to bed,
like a couple of hours before you go to 

2570
02:15:12,881 --> 02:15:14,741
bed,
you have lucid dreams whether you like 

2571
02:15:14,741 --> 02:15:14,741
it or not,
they're just more.

2572
02:15:14,741 --> 02:15:16,850
It seems like your dreams are more 
durable when you're aware.

2573
02:15:17,110 --> 02:15:19,880
It meets me personally when I'm aware of
my dreams.

2574
02:15:19,881 --> 02:15:21,500
Normally they'd fade away like,
Oh,

2575
02:15:21,501 --> 02:15:22,670
I'm dreaming,
and then it's gone.

2576
02:15:22,671 --> 02:15:23,090
I wake up.

2577
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:28,680
You're just boosting what's a natural 
process because when you go to sleep,

2578
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:33,740
your brain becomes flooded with 
acetylcholine and these detours,

2579
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:35,850
these,
these troll pain alkaloids,

2580
02:15:35,851 --> 02:15:40,280
what they do is block acetylcholine and 
they block the receptors,

2581
02:15:40,281 --> 02:15:45,120
so their acetylcholine that called the 
technical term is anti-cholinergic.

2582
02:15:45,121 --> 02:15:49,200
They block acetylcholine from binding to
its receptor,

2583
02:15:49,290 --> 02:15:54,290
so that's the basis of the altered state
of consciousness and interestingly 

2584
02:15:54,290 --> 02:15:59,061
enough,
the detour a state of mind resembles it 

2585
02:16:01,651 --> 02:16:06,651
resembles profound sleep deprivation.
If you keep yourself awake for five 

2586
02:16:09,181 --> 02:16:14,181
days,
you will have experiences and 

2587
02:16:14,181 --> 02:16:17,901
hallucinations that are almost 
indistinguishable from a state of 

2588
02:16:17,901 --> 02:16:19,930
deterrent intoxication.
That's bizarre.

2589
02:16:19,980 --> 02:16:21,720
I don't recommend it,
by the way,

2590
02:16:21,780 --> 02:16:24,770
I mean,
don't do Detroit or if you do deterrent,

2591
02:16:24,810 --> 02:16:29,810
have somebody there is looking after you
because you really can't distinguished 

2592
02:16:29,810 --> 02:16:30,220
reality.

2593
02:16:30,230 --> 02:16:32,430
Um,
you do silly things.

2594
02:16:32,431 --> 02:16:32,800
Uh,
you know,

2595
02:16:32,801 --> 02:16:37,801
I had a friend who took the literal one 
time and he spent the whole time a 

2596
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:43,660
dismantling his motorcycle engine on the
floor,

2597
02:16:43,690 --> 02:16:48,690
on his kitchen floor,
taking it apart and cleaning it and 

2598
02:16:48,690 --> 02:16:50,470
putting it back together.
He didn't own a motorcycle.

2599
02:16:56,830 --> 02:16:59,680
Oh my God.
What if he learned how to do to do

2600
02:16:59,690 --> 02:17:04,690
it though?
What if you gave a motorcycle engine is 

2601
02:17:04,690 --> 02:17:04,690
like,
Oh,

2602
02:17:04,690 --> 02:17:06,911
I've done this.
And then he starts doing it all the 

2603
02:17:06,911 --> 02:17:09,520
other Uber Bizarre.
What is that?

2604
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:13,910
Um,
there's that drug that they use for,

2605
02:17:14,330 --> 02:17:17,750
for air sickness.
Same One.

2606
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:18,530
Scope.
Paula.

2607
02:17:18,531 --> 02:17:19,190
Me.
Yes.

2608
02:17:19,191 --> 02:17:20,860
That's the one.
That's the same thing.

2609
02:17:22,380 --> 02:17:27,280
That's Columbia Dental psychoactive 
alkaloid in detour and Bella,

2610
02:17:27,330 --> 02:17:29,690
Donna,
and this is the one that does it.

2611
02:17:29,691 --> 02:17:32,280
There are other alkaloids,
but it's primarily sculpture.

2612
02:17:33,630 --> 02:17:36,210
And they used to use medically,
they used to use scope.

2613
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:39,230
Paula mean because it's a for 
childbirth.

2614
02:17:39,290 --> 02:17:44,290
Back in the days of barbarism when they 
thought women in order to give 

2615
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:45,890
childbirth,
give birth,

2616
02:17:45,891 --> 02:17:49,130
had to be put in,
it had to be drugged,

2617
02:17:49,131 --> 02:17:54,131
you know,
they use Capella mean to put them in a 

2618
02:17:54,131 --> 02:17:56,321
twilight state,
like a hypnotic state of semi 

2619
02:17:56,960 --> 02:17:59,050
consciousness,
and then they could have the baby,

2620
02:17:59,330 --> 02:18:01,890
of course they didn't remember any 
experience,

2621
02:18:02,330 --> 02:18:04,520
which was sort of the point,
I guess.

2622
02:18:05,270 --> 02:18:09,350
How does nicotine fit in?
Because one of my most intense,

2623
02:18:09,351 --> 02:18:12,770
lucid dreaming experiences with,
with a nicotine patch,

2624
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:16,280
nicotine has the opposite effect to the 
tropics.

2625
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:21,340
Nicotine is what's the trope?
Answer what's called a acetylcholine 

2626
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:25,220
antagonists.
Nicotine is an agonist,

2627
02:18:25,250 --> 02:18:30,250
so it has an Acetylcholine like effect,
which is why when you smoke you get this

2628
02:18:32,061 --> 02:18:34,400
sort of cognitive activation,
you know,

2629
02:18:34,401 --> 02:18:39,401
it's great to settle down and focus your
attention on a task.

2630
02:18:41,091 --> 02:18:46,091
It activates cognition.
A lot of the research now on Alzheimer's

2631
02:18:47,331 --> 02:18:51,740
and other dementias are finding things 
that either have this,

2632
02:18:51,741 --> 02:18:52,460
uh,
this,

2633
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:54,400
this colon,
colon nurture jake,

2634
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:59,700
a agonist effect like nicotine,
or they block acetylcholine from being 

2635
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:03,830
broken down their Acetylcholine esterase
inhibitors.

2636
02:19:03,831 --> 02:19:08,660
Acetylcholine estrace is the insight in 
that breaks down acetylcholine.

2637
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,940
I don't smoke cigarettes,
but I,

2638
02:19:10,941 --> 02:19:15,941
um,
I found it absolutely fascinating 

2639
02:19:15,941 --> 02:19:18,650
reading Stephen King's book on writing 
where he talked about when he stopped 

2640
02:19:18,650 --> 02:19:20,390
smoking cigarettes.
It really affected his writing process.

2641
02:19:20,391 --> 02:19:22,810
Absolutely.
I'm not surprised she didn't,

2642
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:25,630
you know,
didn't really fire up the way he is.

2643
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:27,450
That's right.
Yeah.

2644
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:31,520
Yeah.
So now we've again got off the track and

2645
02:19:31,521 --> 02:19:34,610
we're off in the jungles of 
pharmacology.

2646
02:19:34,690 --> 02:19:35,440
No,
it's fascinating.

2647
02:19:35,820 --> 02:19:36,910
I mean,
it's off track at all.

2648
02:19:36,911 --> 02:19:39,700
I mean,
it's all interesting because it's all in

2649
02:19:39,701 --> 02:19:44,701
relationship to what we understand 
currently about compounds that affect 

2650
02:19:45,281 --> 02:19:50,281
the human body and what you're doing 
with the ethno botanical stewardship 

2651
02:19:50,281 --> 02:19:54,430
council is to try to educate people on 
these things,

2652
02:19:54,431 --> 02:19:59,431
try to expand consciousness and 
awareness of these things and really 

2653
02:19:59,431 --> 02:20:00,910
just just promote it and put energy 
behind it.

2654
02:20:01,090 --> 02:20:01,290
[inaudible],

2655
02:20:02,010 --> 02:20:07,010
part of it is education.
It's developing a model of self 

2656
02:20:07,010 --> 02:20:11,001
regulation that can,
can improve the safety of people that 

2657
02:20:11,001 --> 02:20:15,051
want to use these traditional plants.
But one thing I want to be clear about 

2658
02:20:15,051 --> 02:20:17,340
is that we're ourselves not setting a 
standard per se.

2659
02:20:17,341 --> 02:20:22,341
We're engaging people in dialogue,
we're kind of setting the table for 

2660
02:20:22,341 --> 02:20:24,870
indigenous groups and people that run 
retreat centers,

2661
02:20:26,130 --> 02:20:28,630
people that are selling Iowasca online,
etc.

2662
02:20:28,710 --> 02:20:33,710
All the people that are involved in the 
kind of value chain of iowasca to come 

2663
02:20:33,710 --> 02:20:34,980
together and determine,
well,

2664
02:20:34,981 --> 02:20:37,910
what is sustainability at the site level
look like?

2665
02:20:37,930 --> 02:20:42,930
Like ecotourism,
how are you giving back to the 

2666
02:20:42,930 --> 02:20:45,741
community,
to the biodiversity of the place where 

2667
02:20:45,741 --> 02:20:45,741
you're,
where you have your site,

2668
02:20:45,741 --> 02:20:47,220
how are you making sure that people in 
the ceremony are safe,

2669
02:20:47,610 --> 02:20:50,460
that they're screen psychologically or 
for heart conditions.

2670
02:20:50,461 --> 02:20:55,461
They're not tAking antidepressants,
they have a people babysitting or 

2671
02:20:55,461 --> 02:21:00,231
watching,
so people don't wander off into the 

2672
02:21:00,231 --> 02:21:00,231
jungle.

2673
02:21:00,231 --> 02:21:00,231
The antidepressants wants is an 
interesting one.

2674
02:21:00,231 --> 02:21:01,200
What,
what's the issue with that?

2675
02:21:02,290 --> 02:21:07,290
Well,
the issue with antidepressants and 

2676
02:21:07,290 --> 02:21:10,170
iowasca is [inaudible].
Iowasca involves mao inhibitors,

2677
02:21:11,381 --> 02:21:13,060
right?
and so,

2678
02:21:13,790 --> 02:21:14,430
uh,

2679
02:21:15,550 --> 02:21:18,610
it prevents the breakdown of dmt,
right?

2680
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:23,640
And the butt.
And so there's a lot of dmt in your 

2681
02:21:24,251 --> 02:21:26,860
suit.
It's a serotonergic agonist,

2682
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:30,280
right?
And so are the antidepressants.

2683
02:21:30,310 --> 02:21:35,310
So you are essentially piling on one 
sarah to nurture agonist on another 

2684
02:21:36,650 --> 02:21:38,830
cause you're inhibited.
And the breakdown process,

2685
02:21:38,831 --> 02:21:43,060
man is involved in breaking down both 
dmt and serotonin,

2686
02:21:43,510 --> 02:21:46,120
so the,
the safety wise,

2687
02:21:46,121 --> 02:21:49,990
the issue is that it could lead to 
what's called a serotonin syndrome.

2688
02:21:50,440 --> 02:21:55,440
And the serotonin syndrome is something 
that happens when you got too much 

2689
02:21:55,440 --> 02:21:55,780
serotonin,
too much,

2690
02:21:56,530 --> 02:21:57,250
uh,

2691
02:21:58,780 --> 02:22:03,780
pushing the serotonin button a little 
bit too hard and it can lead to 

2692
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:07,680
hyperthermia and a cardiac,
your regularities and,

2693
02:22:07,681 --> 02:22:10,210
uh,
ultimately death if it's really bad,

2694
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:13,810
you want to avoid the serotonin syndrome
if possible.

2695
02:22:13,850 --> 02:22:18,850
That's fascinating because that's also 
an issue that people have if they take 

2696
02:22:18,850 --> 02:22:22,360
an ssri and they want to consume 
tryptophan or five htp.

2697
02:22:22,460 --> 02:22:23,990
Exactly,
exactly.

2698
02:22:24,050 --> 02:22:29,050
That's also a one way to do it.
And in some ways the psychedelic 

2699
02:22:29,050 --> 02:22:31,980
experience itself is kind of skirting 
this.

2700
02:22:31,981 --> 02:22:32,590
I mean,
you're,

2701
02:22:32,980 --> 02:22:35,580
you're pushing the serotonin button,
right?

2702
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:40,610
But in most cases with psychedelic you,
you haven't inactivated the instamatic 

2703
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:46,620
breaks that are,
that are metabolizing this stuff.

2704
02:22:46,621 --> 02:22:49,350
So It's not an issue with iowasca,
it's,

2705
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:54,920
it's really only an issue if you're 
taking an ssri or if you're taking mao 

2706
02:22:56,221 --> 02:22:59,070
inhibitors,
which most people,

2707
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:04,280
they're not used clinically anymore.
there was a whole older generation of 

2708
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:07,040
antidepressants that are mao inhibitors.
You shouldn't,

2709
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:12,200
you shouldn't combine those with iowasca
and you shouldn't combine ssrs with 

2710
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:13,570
iowasca.
The,

2711
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:18,150
that may be a theoretical hazard.
There's,

2712
02:23:18,151 --> 02:23:23,151
I haven't seen a lot of reports of 
serotonin syndrome happening with 

2713
02:23:23,970 --> 02:23:25,860
iowasca.
Um,

2714
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:31,040
but so it's a theoretical hazard,
but I'm sure there are people taking 

2715
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:35,030
serotonin uptake inhibitors that are 
taking iowasca given there is no 

2716
02:23:35,030 --> 02:23:38,220
problem,
but they're probably taking lower doses.

2717
02:23:38,580 --> 02:23:41,490
It's just a good idea to get off those 
things.

2718
02:23:43,170 --> 02:23:48,170
Before you take iowasca,
is it a good idea to get off those 

2719
02:23:48,170 --> 02:23:48,170
things,
period?

2720
02:23:48,170 --> 02:23:50,130
Yeah,
I mean is if you can,

2721
02:23:50,131 --> 02:23:53,400
if not for every day really helped some 
people,

2722
02:23:53,401 --> 02:23:55,770
but yeah,
but a lot of times,

2723
02:23:55,800 --> 02:23:57,000
uh,
you know,

2724
02:23:57,060 --> 02:24:02,060
uh,
antidepressants are over prescribed and 

2725
02:24:02,060 --> 02:24:03,150
overused for too many things.
They don't,

2726
02:24:03,300 --> 02:24:06,780
they don't really help people get to the
root of their problems.

2727
02:24:06,781 --> 02:24:11,220
They just kind of bandaid it over and 
you feel sort of normal,

2728
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:16,700
you know,
and you can be a productive citizen and 

2729
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:16,700
you don't really think about things too 
much.

2730
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:18,870
They're prescribed for ptsd,
you know,

2731
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:23,900
but they don't cure ptsd.
They just kind of dampen it down and 

2732
02:24:25,370 --> 02:24:27,900
bury it.
They don't give you an opportunity,

2733
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:29,550
uh,
to really,

2734
02:24:29,790 --> 02:24:30,770
uh,
you know,

2735
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:36,080
look at issues and work them through.
This is why psychedelics or not a good 

2736
02:24:37,621 --> 02:24:39,060
model for big pharma.

2737
02:24:39,090 --> 02:24:44,090
Big pharma wants things like ssri,
which you take everyday for the rest of 

2738
02:24:44,090 --> 02:24:45,750
your life.
That's the business model.

2739
02:24:46,140 --> 02:24:51,140
Psychedelics are things that you might 
take a few times and work through your 

2740
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:53,340
issues and you don't need 
antidepressants.

2741
02:24:53,341 --> 02:24:57,210
After that.
I've talked to many,

2742
02:24:57,211 --> 02:24:58,860
many people who said,
you know,

2743
02:24:58,890 --> 02:25:02,100
who have been on antidepressants.
They go to south America,

2744
02:25:02,101 --> 02:25:07,101
they take a few iowasca sessions.
They never have to go back to 

2745
02:25:07,101 --> 02:25:08,670
antidepressants again.
I mean,

2746
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:13,500
they can get off at for good.
Many people have that experience.

2747
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:17,970
That's a huge problem financially for 
pharmaceutical companies as well.

2748
02:25:17,971 --> 02:25:22,971
You don't see him pilate on exactly what
they need to start selling iowasca yeah.

2749
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:29,140
Yeah.
It's not gonna work that way because big

2750
02:25:29,141 --> 02:25:31,840
pharma,
they want drugs that people consume.

2751
02:25:31,841 --> 02:25:34,810
I think the way that.
I think one of the business model,

2752
02:25:35,380 --> 02:25:40,380
you can't use these drugs in therapy in,
in a therapeutic session without intense

2753
02:25:41,470 --> 02:25:43,750
psychotherapy,
whether,

2754
02:25:43,810 --> 02:25:48,810
whether that's actual psychotherapy or 
shamanism or some combination of those 

2755
02:25:48,810 --> 02:25:53,551
things,
these are drugs that have to be used in 

2756
02:25:53,551 --> 02:25:53,551
context,
know the,

2757
02:25:53,551 --> 02:25:58,070
you know,
the take two and call me in the morning 

2758
02:25:58,070 --> 02:25:58,070
model doesn't work for these.

2759
02:25:58,070 --> 02:26:01,480
These have to be used in a very highly 
controlled set and setting.

2760
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:04,270
So I think where they,
uh,

2761
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:09,300
where the business model come see it is 
you have places where people can go and 

2762
02:26:09,300 --> 02:26:13,720
get this kind of therapy.
So it shifts from the drug itself.

2763
02:26:13,721 --> 02:26:14,700
The emphasis is,
uh,

2764
02:26:14,770 --> 02:26:15,620
you know,
uh,

2765
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:20,670
our whole biomedical industrial complex 
is set up to encourage bandaid 

2766
02:26:22,541 --> 02:26:23,860
solutions.
You know,

2767
02:26:23,890 --> 02:26:26,470
you have a problem,
you go see your psychiatrist,

2768
02:26:26,471 --> 02:26:29,260
he has seven minutes.
If he's lucky to talk to you,

2769
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:31,840
here's the prescription,
get out of here.

2770
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:37,160
You know,
that's the way it works with 

2771
02:26:37,160 --> 02:26:37,160
psychedelic.
He actually have to have a therapist who

2772
02:26:37,160 --> 02:26:41,581
will sit down and talk with you.
This whole novel concept and uh,

2773
02:26:42,370 --> 02:26:47,370
you know,
so I think where the business potential 

2774
02:26:47,370 --> 02:26:50,341
comes in is that to,
to have centers of therapy where you 

2775
02:26:50,831 --> 02:26:55,831
couldn't go and get psychedelic therapy 
and the emphasis is more on the setting 

2776
02:26:56,591 --> 02:26:59,440
and the services provided than the 
actual chemicals.

2777
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:01,790
Yeah.
The setting and the,

2778
02:27:01,970 --> 02:27:02,480
uh,
the,

2779
02:27:02,550 --> 02:27:07,550
the new this is possible in other 
countries where it's legal in America 

2780
02:27:07,550 --> 02:27:10,560
started happening in America right now.
It's a huge issue.

2781
02:27:10,770 --> 02:27:15,770
But josh was talking about selling 
iowasca online.

2782
02:27:16,410 --> 02:27:18,930
I mean,
how many people do that in?

2783
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:23,960
What's the Legality when it comes to the
plants themselves are not necessarily 

2784
02:27:24,691 --> 02:27:26,180
illegal.
Right?

2785
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:28,800
Right.
Dmt is illegal.

2786
02:27:29,390 --> 02:27:34,390
Dmt is illegal,
but dmt is found in so many plants that 

2787
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:37,710
uh,
you know,

2788
02:27:38,680 --> 02:27:43,680
they,
they can't really make all those plants 

2789
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:43,680
illegal because,
you know,

2790
02:27:44,190 --> 02:27:45,080
I mean,
they can,

2791
02:27:45,110 --> 02:27:46,880
but they're not going to be able to 
enforce it.

2792
02:27:46,890 --> 02:27:48,650
Then it's going to be able to have 
salad.

2793
02:27:49,460 --> 02:27:54,460
Literally.
You're not going to be able to have 

2794
02:27:54,460 --> 02:27:54,460
salad.
I mean,

2795
02:27:54,460 --> 02:27:54,460
I'm,
you know,

2796
02:27:54,460 --> 02:27:59,200
hearkening back to what we were saying 
about how close dmt is to tryptofan two 

2797
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:00,650
steps away.
I'll bet you,

2798
02:28:01,310 --> 02:28:01,790
I mean,
I,

2799
02:28:01,791 --> 02:28:04,250
I wish somebody would do this,
there's no funding for this,

2800
02:28:04,251 --> 02:28:07,670
but I'll bet you if you had sufficiently
sensitive instruments,

2801
02:28:08,120 --> 02:28:12,140
you could find dmt in all plants.
You know,

2802
02:28:12,141 --> 02:28:17,141
you could just start randomly selecting 
them out of your backyard and run them 

2803
02:28:17,141 --> 02:28:19,580
through the mass spec or whatever.
You could pick up dmt.

2804
02:28:19,850 --> 02:28:24,850
Not in usable amounts,
but it's universally just nature is 

2805
02:28:24,850 --> 02:28:25,690
drenched in dia.

2806
02:28:25,820 --> 02:28:29,660
Why do you think that is?
Because it's so close to trip to fan,

2807
02:28:30,650 --> 02:28:31,720
you know,
and it's just the,

2808
02:28:31,950 --> 02:28:36,020
the compound tryptofan is universally 
distributed.

2809
02:28:36,530 --> 02:28:41,510
The enzymes that transform it to dmt 
have other cellular functions.

2810
02:28:41,511 --> 02:28:46,511
So they're found in all cells.
They're just part of metabolism and so 

2811
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:50,090
it's just an accident of nature,
you know?

2812
02:28:50,091 --> 02:28:52,280
it's just,
it's just the way it is.

2813
02:28:52,730 --> 02:28:57,730
What a fascinating war.
It's actually maybe nature's trying to 

2814
02:28:57,730 --> 02:29:01,220
send us on a little message if you want 
to interpret it that way,

2815
02:29:01,221 --> 02:29:06,221
but it's just the way it is or it's just
a part of the building blocks of the 

2816
02:29:06,221 --> 02:29:08,090
universe itself.
Part of the building blocks of.

2817
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:09,740
Exactly,
exactly.

2818
02:29:09,830 --> 02:29:14,830
And that,
that chemical doorway to another 

2819
02:29:14,830 --> 02:29:14,900
dimension exists in virtually everything
that's alive.

2820
02:29:16,220 --> 02:29:19,720
What a mind fuck that is selling iowasca
uh,

2821
02:29:19,790 --> 02:29:21,950
online.
I don't know if uh,

2822
02:29:22,130 --> 02:29:27,130
I don't know if people are selling 
iowasca prepared a iowasca bruce online 

2823
02:29:29,380 --> 02:29:33,770
are,
seems to be the kid in a gray area.

2824
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:37,380
yeah.
I think that's irresponsible because.

2825
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:40,010
Well,
because it's a,

2826
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:44,540
it's a drug that needs to be taken and 
an appropriate sentence setting.

2827
02:29:44,570 --> 02:29:49,570
It needs guidance.
So to sell it online is to be guilty of 

2828
02:29:52,281 --> 02:29:55,280
that whole thing.
Take two and call me in the morning,

2829
02:29:55,310 --> 02:30:00,310
go off and do this with your friends.
Well that's what went out in the 

2830
02:30:00,310 --> 02:30:02,490
operation and,
and the any real knowledge.

2831
02:30:02,491 --> 02:30:05,610
So that's,
that's not ethical in mind

2832
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:10,660
opinion.
That's how five mio is acquired until 

2833
02:30:10,660 --> 02:30:11,790
fairly recently when I bought five.
I mean,

2834
02:30:11,791 --> 02:30:13,060
you know,
I just bought it online.

2835
02:30:13,150 --> 02:30:15,630
It's just delivered me enough to get the
world high.

2836
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:16,750
yeah,
I mean it was a little,

2837
02:30:16,780 --> 02:30:21,780
I mean it,
you realize how potent it is and what a 

2838
02:30:21,780 --> 02:30:24,121
small dose he need.
And if they're sending you some giant 

2839
02:30:24,121 --> 02:30:24,121
supply of it,

2840
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:27,960
well that's an issue with,
with all of these things and the whole,

2841
02:30:28,340 --> 02:30:30,300
you know,
the whole designer drug thing,

2842
02:30:30,301 --> 02:30:32,270
there are,
you know,

2843
02:30:32,310 --> 02:30:36,630
hundreds and hundreds of these things.
So I sort of say,

2844
02:30:36,631 --> 02:30:37,450
well,
you know,

2845
02:30:37,560 --> 02:30:42,560
we should stick with the plants.
At least we know what the identity of 

2846
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:42,560
that.
But,

2847
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:43,140
you know,
I mean,

2848
02:30:44,490 --> 02:30:45,900
I think that,
I mean,

2849
02:30:45,901 --> 02:30:48,510
synthetic drugs are out there.
People are going to use them.

2850
02:30:48,511 --> 02:30:49,980
Uh,
it's,

2851
02:30:49,981 --> 02:30:50,530
uh,
it,

2852
02:30:50,540 --> 02:30:55,540
it comes back to education,
to teach people how to,

2853
02:30:57,630 --> 02:31:02,630
how to use drugs.
Basically you have to teach people how 

2854
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:06,231
to use drugs.
This is what so called drug education 

2855
02:31:06,231 --> 02:31:06,231
has,
won't quite,

2856
02:31:07,170 --> 02:31:09,960
hasn't quite grok to,
hasn't quite admitted,

2857
02:31:09,990 --> 02:31:13,020
but that is in fact,
that's real drug education,

2858
02:31:13,060 --> 02:31:14,300
not,
you know,

2859
02:31:14,580 --> 02:31:16,650
all drugs are bad.
Never take it.

2860
02:31:16,740 --> 02:31:18,450
I mean,
that's absurd.

2861
02:31:18,451 --> 02:31:20,130
That's now you've

2862
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:23,700
lived through several errors of 
psychedelic awareness.

2863
02:31:23,701 --> 02:31:27,570
you lived through the sixties,
you live through all that craziness.

2864
02:31:27,571 --> 02:31:31,500
He lived through the seventies,
you lived through the clamp down and now

2865
02:31:31,501 --> 02:31:32,610
you're here,
which is,

2866
02:31:32,660 --> 02:31:36,210
I think it's safe to call this the 
psychedelic renaissance.

2867
02:31:36,211 --> 02:31:41,211
I think this is.
This is a new time when we'd like to 

2868
02:31:41,211 --> 02:31:41,211
think so I.
I'm pretty positive.

2869
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:46,020
At least it isn't my reality there.
The reality that I experienced,

2870
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:51,560
I mean I've never in my time seen 
psychedelics more reference than I see 

2871
02:31:51,560 --> 02:31:55,920
them today and part of it's because the 
company I keep part of it is because the

2872
02:31:55,921 --> 02:31:59,040
message that I put out and the people 
that I interact with because of that,

2873
02:31:59,340 --> 02:32:02,130
but I think also it's just a.
It's just a matter of the cat got out of

2874
02:32:02,131 --> 02:32:03,420
the bag.
The stigma

2875
02:32:03,530 --> 02:32:08,530
is fading away.
The whole sixties baggage that 

2876
02:32:08,530 --> 02:32:12,790
psychedelics have been have been 
marginalized with for so long that's 

2877
02:32:12,951 --> 02:32:17,951
going away and a new more positive 
perception is appearing as some of these

2878
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:24,040
therapeutic uses are becoming more aware
in general consciousness.

2879
02:32:24,510 --> 02:32:28,220
So ptsd can be treated with mds,
mtma.

2880
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:30,980
We've got veterans out there who need 
that.

2881
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:35,870
That's a hugely powerful message and if 
the department of defense is behind it,

2882
02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:37,880
it can't be bad.

2883
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:38,780
Yeah.
I mean,

2884
02:32:38,790 --> 02:32:43,790
isn't that kind of ironic that the need 
for psychedelics has arisen from the war

2885
02:32:44,531 --> 02:32:48,100
culture that we totally ironic,
but so strange.

2886
02:32:48,101 --> 02:32:48,850
There it is.

2887
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:54,100
And so these positive messages are being
hurt more and more and there's less and 

2888
02:32:55,351 --> 02:32:57,960
less a sort of,
you know,

2889
02:32:58,830 --> 02:33:03,830
partly because a lot of people from the 
sixties are dying off or whatever they 

2890
02:33:03,830 --> 02:33:07,230
don't remember,
but the knee jerk negative message about

2891
02:33:07,231 --> 02:33:10,830
psychedelics is not happening this 
month.

2892
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:11,740
Yeah.
There's,

2893
02:33:11,780 --> 02:33:16,780
they're much harder to distinguish now.
The folks who use them then the hippies 

2894
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:18,680
with the beads and the,
you know,

2895
02:33:18,681 --> 02:33:19,080
the,
the,

2896
02:33:19,081 --> 02:33:22,800
the look which was so stereotypical of 
what,

2897
02:33:23,190 --> 02:33:28,190
you know,
the goldwater republicans found 

2898
02:33:28,190 --> 02:33:30,720
reprehensible about that generation.
They were lazy,

2899
02:33:30,750 --> 02:33:35,750
shiftless do for nothing.
People that just wanted to get high and 

2900
02:33:35,750 --> 02:33:35,750
escape reality and that,
that,

2901
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:39,990
that paradigm that,
that perception is passing.

2902
02:33:40,090 --> 02:33:41,490
Yeah.
That's all to the good.

2903
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:44,820
What has it been like for you to 
experience these different waves?

2904
02:33:47,240 --> 02:33:48,270
Well,
uh,

2905
02:33:51,130 --> 02:33:56,130
I don't know.
I haven'T really been personally 

2906
02:33:56,130 --> 02:33:57,350
impacted by this,
this thing,

2907
02:33:57,410 --> 02:33:58,040
you know,
I mean,

2908
02:33:58,090 --> 02:34:03,090
I've been where I've been all the way 
through and not particularly public.

2909
02:34:03,891 --> 02:34:06,680
I'm much more public now about it than I
have been.

2910
02:34:06,681 --> 02:34:08,720
So I may,
maybe that's a difference.

2911
02:34:09,160 --> 02:34:14,160
Uh,
but I don't feel that I have to be 

2912
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:16,520
careful about talking about it in 
public.

2913
02:34:16,521 --> 02:34:17,060
I mean,
I'm,

2914
02:34:17,770 --> 02:34:21,370
I consider myself an advocate for 
responsible use,

2915
02:34:21,790 --> 02:34:23,380
you know,
and good science.

2916
02:34:23,381 --> 02:34:26,770
And I'm not even saying people should 
even take these things take,

2917
02:34:26,910 --> 02:34:29,590
you know,
what I'm saying is that if you decide to

2918
02:34:29,591 --> 02:34:32,020
take it,
go into it with open eyes,

2919
02:34:32,410 --> 02:34:37,410
do some preparation,
pay attention to set and setting do it 

2920
02:34:37,410 --> 02:34:38,030
in a way that,
you know,

2921
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:41,200
if there are benefits to be had 
maximized the benefit.

2922
02:34:41,201 --> 02:34:46,201
So approach it as a conscious,
a conscious exercise and uh,

2923
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:49,930
you know,
um,

2924
02:34:50,050 --> 02:34:50,740
and,
and,

2925
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:54,040
and approach them with respect and in 
intention.

2926
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:55,510
These are serious thing.

2927
02:34:55,820 --> 02:34:59,750
What do you say to someone who has zero 
experience and he thinks I'm gay.

2928
02:34:59,751 --> 02:35:04,751
I guarantee you right now this podcast 
is reaching people that have no 

2929
02:35:04,910 --> 02:35:09,910
psychedelic experience whatsoever.
They don't know anyone who has had any 

2930
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:14,381
psychedelic experience.
They don't know where to turn or where 

2931
02:35:14,381 --> 02:35:16,901
to start,
but they're very intrigued and the 

2932
02:35:16,901 --> 02:35:16,901
door's been open to them.

2933
02:35:16,901 --> 02:35:20,630
Well,
the first thing to do is get yourself 

2934
02:35:20,630 --> 02:35:20,630
educated about it,
you know,

2935
02:35:20,630 --> 02:35:24,710
like sign up for this symposium.
I mean watch the online thing,

2936
02:35:25,021 --> 02:35:27,000
but there are many other tools.
Uh,

2937
02:35:27,001 --> 02:35:32,001
another group that I love to plug and I 
think they're doing a marvelous work is 

2938
02:35:32,001 --> 02:35:35,250
erowid.org.
It's online.

2939
02:35:35,251 --> 02:35:40,251
It's the best online source of 
information about psychoactive drugs,

2940
02:35:40,831 --> 02:35:43,320
of all kinds,
not just psychedelics.

2941
02:35:43,770 --> 02:35:48,770
It's the go to place on the web.
If you want real solid information,

2942
02:35:49,141 --> 02:35:53,310
not bullshit,
not put out by the propaganda put out by

2943
02:35:53,311 --> 02:35:58,311
people who,
whose commitment is to accurate 

2944
02:35:58,311 --> 02:35:58,770
information.
Start there.

2945
02:35:58,830 --> 02:36:00,300
It's fantastic.
Read about it.

2946
02:36:00,330 --> 02:36:05,330
There are trip reports,
there were safety reports that 

2947
02:36:05,330 --> 02:36:05,370
chemistry,
the,

2948
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:06,120
you know,
the,

2949
02:36:06,121 --> 02:36:08,490
uh,
the field botany,

2950
02:36:08,491 --> 02:36:11,280
the part of it that the shamanic 
traditions,

2951
02:36:11,281 --> 02:36:16,281
it's all represented there.
That's the place to start spelling out 

2952
02:36:16,281 --> 02:36:19,470
to for p,
r o w id erowid.org.

2953
02:36:19,830 --> 02:36:24,830
Go there and read up about it.
Educate yourself before you take the 

2954
02:36:24,830 --> 02:36:27,630
substance so that you can make an 
informed decision,

2955
02:36:28,180 --> 02:36:32,100
uh,
what's an appropriate method of use?

2956
02:36:32,430 --> 02:36:34,980
Uh,
what are the right circumstances?

2957
02:36:34,981 --> 02:36:38,700
What are the hazards?
What do you not want to do?

2958
02:36:39,570 --> 02:36:41,120
I think that's the first thing.
And I,

2959
02:36:41,230 --> 02:36:42,060
I think,
again,

2960
02:36:42,061 --> 02:36:47,040
I think this symposium,
a conference is gonna be great,

2961
02:36:47,070 --> 02:36:49,920
but it's also exemplary of what needs to
happen.

2962
02:36:49,921 --> 02:36:52,620
And I'm really impressed that,
you know,

2963
02:36:53,100 --> 02:36:58,100
young people like the folks that are 
organizing this conference or are 

2964
02:36:58,100 --> 02:37:02,451
stepping up to the plate and saying,
we want to make this a part of 

2965
02:37:03,480 --> 02:37:07,050
education,
an educational dialogue.

2966
02:37:07,110 --> 02:37:11,310
We want to have this happen on lots of 
university campuses.

2967
02:37:11,311 --> 02:37:16,130
Lots of places.
That's the thing we have better now than

2968
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:18,380
we've ever had for sharing the 
information.

2969
02:37:18,860 --> 02:37:21,300
Take advantage of those tools.
Uh,

2970
02:37:21,320 --> 02:37:23,900
you know,
before back in the sixties,

2971
02:37:23,901 --> 02:37:28,901
seventies,
you might not have had no experience 

2972
02:37:28,901 --> 02:37:31,640
with psychedelics and no real,
uh,

2973
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:36,700
you know,
no way to know how am I going to find 

2974
02:37:36,700 --> 02:37:36,700
out about these things.
You know,

2975
02:37:36,700 --> 02:37:39,230
now it's a click of a mouse and you're 
there,

2976
02:37:39,510 --> 02:37:43,280
and now there's no excuse for not 
educating yourself.

2977
02:37:44,130 --> 02:37:46,920
Another very good site is ice 
[inaudible] dot org,

2978
02:37:46,921 --> 02:37:51,921
I c e r s the international center for 
ethnobotanical ethno botanical education

2979
02:37:54,061 --> 02:37:59,061
research and service based in europe.
They have a ton of information about 

2980
02:37:59,061 --> 02:38:02,160
iowasca boga,
the plant based psychedelics.

2981
02:38:02,350 --> 02:38:05,550
There also a sort of incubation partner 
for the esc,

2982
02:38:05,910 --> 02:38:06,920
helping esc.

2983
02:38:07,510 --> 02:38:11,540
Ibogaine is another fantastic drug for 
dealing with addiction.

2984
02:38:11,610 --> 02:38:16,610
Uh,
I have a good friend who had a back 

2985
02:38:16,610 --> 02:38:18,921
injury and got hooked on pain pills and 
had a real problem and really couldn't 

2986
02:38:18,921 --> 02:38:18,921
kick it.
Uh,

2987
02:38:18,921 --> 02:38:21,090
wenT to Mexico,
did ibogaine,

2988
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:25,320
became completely fascinated,
cured,

2989
02:38:25,500 --> 02:38:30,500
and absolutely fascinated by obligation.
And how is this possible that this is 

2990
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:32,430
escape?
Western medicine started his own.

2991
02:38:32,520 --> 02:38:35,940
Um,
I became a center down there and now,

2992
02:38:35,970 --> 02:38:36,810
you know,
regular.

2993
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:38,730
I mean,
he's just a different human being.

2994
02:38:38,731 --> 02:38:41,130
When I talked to him,
he's just so at peace and just,

2995
02:38:41,410 --> 02:38:44,280
it's a different guy.
He knows himself in a different way.

2996
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:49,420
[inaudible],
it breaks that physical addiction to 

2997
02:38:49,420 --> 02:38:52,231
opiates.
Instantly the esc is of signing a 

2998
02:38:53,500 --> 02:38:58,500
memorandum of understanding with the 
global ibogaine therapists alliance to 

2999
02:38:58,500 --> 02:39:02,671
work on the safety and the 
sustainability of that traditional 

3000
02:39:02,671 --> 02:39:05,881
plant.
It's under extreme pressure from the 

3001
02:39:05,881 --> 02:39:09,660
growing global demand.
It's traditionally from africa and it 

3002
02:39:09,660 --> 02:39:12,901
takes seven years for a mature plant to 
be grown and then you have to take the 

3003
02:39:13,331 --> 02:39:15,640
root out and you kill the plant.
So,

3004
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:17,710
um,
there's a lot of Work to be done.

3005
02:39:18,300 --> 02:39:19,110
Um,
there's a,

3006
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:22,660
a global ibogaine therapist alliance 
conference in durban,

3007
02:39:22,940 --> 02:39:27,940
uh,
this may as well we're hoping to have 

3008
02:39:27,940 --> 02:39:29,200
some big announcements come out of that 
on the sustainability front.

3009
02:39:29,440 --> 02:39:31,750
So many things came out.
Again,

3010
02:39:32,130 --> 02:39:36,400
it was,
it never went away.

3011
02:39:36,401 --> 02:39:38,320
It was always there,
but it a,

3012
02:39:38,350 --> 02:39:41,590
you know,
it was suppressed essentially in western

3013
02:39:41,591 --> 02:39:45,010
medicine.
I mean they had a perception that it had

3014
02:39:45,011 --> 02:39:50,011
no place.
There were almost clinical studies 

3015
02:39:50,011 --> 02:39:52,830
approved by the fda and then they 
stepped back from it because of some 

3016
02:39:52,830 --> 02:39:57,540
supposedly neuro toxicity,
which I don't think they ever 

3017
02:39:57,540 --> 02:39:58,990
satisfactorily demonstrated.
But that's a good example.

3018
02:39:59,020 --> 02:40:01,990
You know,
the therapeutic community was saying,

3019
02:40:01,991 --> 02:40:06,991
well,
I gave is so useful for this addiction 

3020
02:40:06,991 --> 02:40:08,320
therapy that we're just not gonna put up
with this.

3021
02:40:08,321 --> 02:40:12,220
and so I began as not illegal.
It's illegal in the states,

3022
02:40:12,221 --> 02:40:17,221
but it's not in most of the world.
So these addiction treatment centers 

3023
02:40:17,731 --> 02:40:21,240
have blossomed all over the world.
There's Mexico,

3024
02:40:21,241 --> 02:40:23,260
south America,
even Canada.

3025
02:40:23,300 --> 02:40:28,300
There are treatment centers that use 
ibogaine to treat addiction and they've 

3026
02:40:28,381 --> 02:40:29,100
just said,
well,

3027
02:40:29,130 --> 02:40:30,450
you know,
fuck the fda,

3028
02:40:30,451 --> 02:40:35,451
we're going to step outside that 
framework and do it because it's 

3029
02:40:35,451 --> 02:40:39,120
important to get this therapy to people 
and that's all to the good.

3030
02:40:39,121 --> 02:40:42,600
I think that's a model maybe for what's 
going to happen with iowasca.

3031
02:40:43,010 --> 02:40:44,210
Yeah,
I would hope so.

3032
02:40:44,211 --> 02:40:49,211
And I would.
I would like to see what's going on 

3033
02:40:49,211 --> 02:40:49,211
right now with marijuana in this 
country.

3034
02:40:49,211 --> 02:40:50,630
Slowly started happening with iowasca,
ibogaine,

3035
02:40:50,910 --> 02:40:52,120
psilocybin,
all the,

3036
02:40:52,121 --> 02:40:54,110
all these various things.
Um,

3037
02:40:54,500 --> 02:40:55,490
do you have hope for that?

3038
02:40:56,640 --> 02:40:57,870
Totally.
I do.

3039
02:40:57,960 --> 02:41:01,950
History is on our side.
And first thing I'd tell people that are

3040
02:41:01,951 --> 02:41:06,951
considering psychedelics is put your 
preconceptions aside and just look at 

3041
02:41:06,951 --> 02:41:07,800
the facts.
What would you say that

3042
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:08,860
someone say,
look,

3043
02:41:08,890 --> 02:41:12,490
we're talking about young people.
What if a guy's 50 and you know,

3044
02:41:12,491 --> 02:41:15,330
maybe he's going through a rough divorce
and uh,

3045
02:41:15,331 --> 02:41:15,970
you know,
I was like,

3046
02:41:16,030 --> 02:41:18,730
man,
this fucking I need to reset my brain.

3047
02:41:18,760 --> 02:41:20,920
I need to figure this out,
but I don't know anybody.

3048
02:41:21,100 --> 02:41:24,790
Nobody at the office knows anything 
about this stuff.

3049
02:41:26,020 --> 02:41:27,310
Right?
Well,

3050
02:41:27,660 --> 02:41:31,060
a smoked a joint in college.
That's about it.

3051
02:41:32,300 --> 02:41:36,220
Take it in a traditional context that 
you feel comfortable with.

3052
02:41:36,250 --> 02:41:41,250
Take it in a.
If you're looking for psychological 

3053
02:41:41,250 --> 02:41:44,371
help,
maybe take it at a center that focuses 

3054
02:41:44,371 --> 02:41:46,681
on that if you want to,
if you've always been attracted to 

3055
02:41:46,681 --> 02:41:49,831
shamanic experiences,
then suss out which centers might be 

3056
02:41:49,831 --> 02:41:53,881
best for you and read revIews of them.
And in two to three years the esc will 

3057
02:41:54,431 --> 02:41:59,431
have a rating system or kind of star 
rating system for sites based on how 

3058
02:41:59,431 --> 02:42:02,740
sustainable they are,
how safe side psychedelics is.

3059
02:42:02,741 --> 02:42:07,741
Not so much a yelp or a deeper level 
than a yelp because they can't fake it 

3060
02:42:08,231 --> 02:42:13,231
though you can't take it,
but it's hard for somebody going in to 

3061
02:42:13,231 --> 02:42:16,771
see what kind of an impact a center has 
on the local community or where they're 

3062
02:42:16,771 --> 02:42:19,480
sourcing the iowasca come from,
comes from and that's where we're,

3063
02:42:19,540 --> 02:42:22,600
the esc is bringing that professional 
expertise to,

3064
02:42:22,770 --> 02:42:24,820
to supplement what the community is 
doing.

3065
02:42:25,390 --> 02:42:30,390
Um,
and certainly we will rely on feedback 

3066
02:42:30,390 --> 02:42:34,591
from visitors that will be part of the 
credibility and the transparency that 

3067
02:42:34,591 --> 02:42:38,131
we're building into the way of assuring 
the sites are sustainable and safe or be

3068
02:42:39,011 --> 02:42:41,710
grievance mechanisms.
If you have a bad experience,

3069
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:44,670
hopefully in five years,
five,

3070
02:42:44,790 --> 02:42:49,790
that's probably optimistic timeframe,
but hopefully in 10 years they'll be 

3071
02:42:49,790 --> 02:42:53,990
places you can go and have these 
experiences where you don't have to 

3072
02:42:53,990 --> 02:42:54,300
leave the country.
I mean,

3073
02:42:54,301 --> 02:42:56,970
you can already find them outside the 
country,

3074
02:42:56,971 --> 02:43:00,480
but it would be nice if there were 
places in the states where you could get

3075
02:43:00,481 --> 02:43:05,481
this and it would,
it would transform a psychiatric 

3076
02:43:05,481 --> 02:43:05,700
medicine.
Uh,

3077
02:43:05,930 --> 02:43:07,920
if there was,
which is again,

3078
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:11,560
threatening to many people with a stake 
whole estate

3079
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:15,760
in how it's done now,
but I talked to so many,

3080
02:43:15,810 --> 02:43:17,770
um,
psychiatrists,

3081
02:43:17,771 --> 02:43:21,460
other professionals that are involved in
the mental health world.

3082
02:43:21,820 --> 02:43:23,680
They're very frustrated.
They're like,

3083
02:43:23,681 --> 02:43:28,681
say these people are hurting and the way
that we're handling them is not solving 

3084
02:43:29,711 --> 02:43:31,870
the problem.
It's only making it worse.

3085
02:43:32,530 --> 02:43:34,270
Um,
so,

3086
02:43:34,360 --> 02:43:38,020
you know,
there needs to be a wholesale,

3087
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:42,130
I wouldn't say overturning,
but transformation of the model.

3088
02:43:44,240 --> 02:43:45,040
I,
um,

3089
02:43:45,730 --> 02:43:48,220
I think that we're on the right track.
I really do.

3090
02:43:48,221 --> 02:43:49,810
I'm,
there's a lot of people that are cynical

3091
02:43:49,811 --> 02:43:54,160
today and they look at today's culture 
and they look at the toxification of our

3092
02:43:54,161 --> 02:43:57,670
environment and the materialism and the 
nonsense on television.

3093
02:43:57,940 --> 02:44:00,300
They see it as a bad sign.
But,

3094
02:44:00,301 --> 02:44:05,301
uh,
I really feel like civilizations 

3095
02:44:05,301 --> 02:44:05,301
cramming.
Yeah,

3096
02:44:05,301 --> 02:44:08,300
I really do.
I really think we're just scrambling to 

3097
02:44:08,300 --> 02:44:11,221
try and maybe we need something like all
this nonsense that we experience on a 

3098
02:44:11,221 --> 02:44:13,950
daily basis to sort of really motivate 
this,

3099
02:44:14,010 --> 02:44:15,640
this global awakening.

3100
02:44:15,910 --> 02:44:18,880
We have to consume it to the extent that
we're sick of it,

3101
02:44:18,940 --> 02:44:23,940
that it makes us sick,
and then we purge the iowasca bottle.

3102
02:44:24,281 --> 02:44:29,281
We consume so much of it that eventually
you just regurgitate it all and you feel

3103
02:44:29,831 --> 02:44:31,730
much better afterwards.
You know?

3104
02:44:32,450 --> 02:44:36,070
Yeah.
I think that's partly what we're doing.

3105
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:41,640
I think the most exciting thing too is 
that we have a way out or we have a way 

3106
02:44:41,891 --> 02:44:44,650
up.
Whereas like it's not like we're in this

3107
02:44:44,651 --> 02:44:47,030
pit and there's no ladder,
like there's a fucking lie.

3108
02:44:47,090 --> 02:44:48,300
Hey,
we have,

3109
02:44:49,210 --> 02:44:50,680
we have the tools.
I mean,

3110
02:44:50,681 --> 02:44:53,680
and they're incredibly profound and 
real,

3111
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:56,080
you know,
these aren't theoretical things like,

3112
02:44:56,290 --> 02:45:01,290
you know,
we have a lot of these theoretical 

3113
02:45:01,290 --> 02:45:01,420
concepts about like fixing the plastic 
in the ocean.

3114
02:45:01,450 --> 02:45:02,110
Well there's,
you know,

3115
02:45:02,111 --> 02:45:05,140
some 19 year old kid figured out a way 
that there's a machine.

3116
02:45:05,141 --> 02:45:10,141
It scoops it up.
Then it converts it into something 

3117
02:45:10,141 --> 02:45:10,141
usable.
Then we could use that for energy.

3118
02:45:10,141 --> 02:45:11,680
And the same thing's true with nuclear 
waste.

3119
02:45:11,681 --> 02:45:14,020
There's some theories about how to.
But those are all.

3120
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:18,190
Those are theoretical.
They may or may not be effective.

3121
02:45:18,220 --> 02:45:23,220
They may or may not ever get built.
The ladder is not be in your life right 

3122
02:45:23,220 --> 02:45:23,470
there.

3123
02:45:23,740 --> 02:45:24,470
Let's,
you know,

3124
02:45:24,500 --> 02:45:26,870
I mean,
in respect to that,

3125
02:45:27,170 --> 02:45:29,990
we look at this dire existential 
situation,

3126
02:45:29,991 --> 02:45:34,991
the environmental crisis and all that.
I take heart in the notion of never 

3127
02:45:35,181 --> 02:45:38,450
underestimate human ingenuity.
You know,

3128
02:45:38,510 --> 02:45:43,510
there are a lot of really smart people 
working on all these problems and that's

3129
02:45:45,410 --> 02:45:46,870
my hope,
you know,

3130
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:51,860
for our survival,
I think that the ingenuity will prevail.

3131
02:45:51,861 --> 02:45:53,930
I hope so,
because otherwise we're in.

3132
02:45:54,380 --> 02:45:56,150
I mean,
we're already in deep shit.

3133
02:45:56,180 --> 02:45:58,940
The question is how do we,
how do we dig out of it?

3134
02:45:59,180 --> 02:46:00,240
And uh,
it,

3135
02:46:00,370 --> 02:46:01,340
it,
it,

3136
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:05,030
you know,
that's why we have these smart brains,

3137
02:46:05,031 --> 02:46:10,031
you know,
we're not going to get there by being 

3138
02:46:10,031 --> 02:46:11,741
stupid.
We've had of that and there's still 

3139
02:46:11,741 --> 02:46:15,290
plenty of it to go around and.
But we need to move beyond that,

3140
02:46:15,390 --> 02:46:18,800
you know,
stop listening to a lot of people,

3141
02:46:18,801 --> 02:46:20,930
like our politicians,
for example,

3142
02:46:21,260 --> 02:46:26,260
who seemed to make a profession of 
stupidity and they're actually proud of 

3143
02:46:26,691 --> 02:46:27,650
their stupidity.

3144
02:46:27,650 --> 02:46:32,650
And that's distressing in any way.
In what way do you feel like that would 

3145
02:46:32,650 --> 02:46:34,100
be like sarah palin mean people like 
that,

3146
02:46:34,101 --> 02:46:35,810
you know,
the science deniers,

3147
02:46:35,811 --> 02:46:37,060
the people that,
you know,

3148
02:46:37,100 --> 02:46:37,850
I don't,
you know,

3149
02:46:37,851 --> 02:46:40,850
don't bother me with your fucking facts.
You know,

3150
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:44,990
my mind is made up and you know,
when god told me this and you know,

3151
02:46:45,050 --> 02:46:46,430
this is horseshit.
I mean,

3152
02:46:46,460 --> 02:46:47,930
come on,
you know,

3153
02:46:48,380 --> 02:46:53,380
clear thinking at least should be a 
criteria and if you want to be a 

3154
02:46:53,380 --> 02:46:54,730
politician,
not somebody who's,

3155
02:46:55,080 --> 02:46:57,560
you know,
a buying into some,

3156
02:46:57,620 --> 02:47:02,620
some myth from the 14th century.
I don't necessarily even think most of 

3157
02:47:02,620 --> 02:47:07,361
them are buying into it.
I think what they've done is realize 

3158
02:47:07,361 --> 02:47:10,391
that there is a market for that.
There's just a gigantic chunk of the 

3159
02:47:10,391 --> 02:47:13,360
population is terrified of change,
terrified of the possibilities,

3160
02:47:13,370 --> 02:47:15,320
the unknown,
the intangibles.

3161
02:47:15,500 --> 02:47:18,290
And they would like something norman 
rockwell,

3162
02:47:18,470 --> 02:47:23,470
they would like you to paint some really
clear and easy to recognize a pattern 

3163
02:47:23,811 --> 02:47:24,350
that they could see.

3164
02:47:24,500 --> 02:47:26,510
Jesus,
thank you jesus.

3165
02:47:26,511 --> 02:47:27,650
You know,
and they just jumped.

3166
02:47:27,740 --> 02:47:32,740
The lord has blessed me in so many ways 
and they just fucking locked themselves 

3167
02:47:32,740 --> 02:47:34,490
in this box of perception.
And then politicians come along and they

3168
02:47:34,500 --> 02:47:34,760
go,
oh,

3169
02:47:34,761 --> 02:47:39,761
that guy,
I know how to fucking play his 

3170
02:47:39,761 --> 02:47:39,761
heartstrings.
Exactly.

3171
02:47:39,761 --> 02:47:43,540
You're part of the problem.
You're not really helping solve the 

3172
02:47:43,540 --> 02:47:46,331
problem.
You're taking advantage of what these 

3173
02:47:46,331 --> 02:47:48,791
people,
what I think even karl rove called 

3174
02:47:48,791 --> 02:47:49,910
useful idiots.
People that want simple answers,

3175
02:47:50,200 --> 02:47:52,880
I call them simple answers for simple 
people.

3176
02:47:53,150 --> 02:47:54,290
Hey,
get over it.

3177
02:47:54,291 --> 02:47:57,260
There are no simple answers,
you know,

3178
02:47:57,261 --> 02:48:00,260
and what we need to be doing this 
looking for the real answers,

3179
02:48:00,770 --> 02:48:05,770
asking the hard questions,
realizing that it's solve very 

3180
02:48:05,770 --> 02:48:06,920
complicated.
There are answers,

3181
02:48:06,921 --> 02:48:10,980
but we're not going to get there through
delusions and fairy tales.

3182
02:48:11,030 --> 02:48:16,030
You know,
we've got to actually acknowledge and 

3183
02:48:16,030 --> 02:48:18,820
start thinking about this and start 
talking about it to other people in a 

3184
02:48:18,891 --> 02:48:23,891
real way.
So sarah pailin these people in these 

3185
02:48:23,891 --> 02:48:25,010
mushrooms,
they're idiots.

3186
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:30,040
He's iowasca.
She needs a dmt trip that she needs a 

3187
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:31,450
head with transplant.
Yeah.

3188
02:48:31,550 --> 02:48:32,510
Fuck yeah,
she would,

3189
02:48:32,511 --> 02:48:37,511
she would,
she would realize that she's right and 

3190
02:48:37,511 --> 02:48:37,511
wrong at the same time.

3191
02:48:38,850 --> 02:48:40,900
Mind blown.
And um,

3192
02:48:40,910 --> 02:48:42,530
okay.
So the website,

3193
02:48:42,570 --> 02:48:44,010
uh,
for uh,

3194
02:48:44,060 --> 02:48:47,060
for the ethno botanical stewardship 
council,

3195
02:48:47,270 --> 02:48:51,170
it's ethno botanical council.org
and the,

3196
02:48:51,171 --> 02:48:56,171
um,
the symposium is spelled sim like as in 

3197
02:48:56,171 --> 02:49:00,970
psychedelic p,
s y symposium 2014.

3198
02:49:00,971 --> 02:49:04,250
It is April 12th and 13th in amherst,
Massachusetts.

3199
02:49:04,700 --> 02:49:06,950
Listen folks,
you've got to make it the upside of this

3200
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:08,730
symposium.org

3201
02:49:08,790 --> 02:49:11,890
or symposium symposia.
Simpler jose.

3202
02:49:11,891 --> 02:49:13,680
A.org.
Yeah.

3203
02:49:14,010 --> 02:49:15,360
Yeah.
And if you could make it there,

3204
02:49:15,361 --> 02:49:19,500
beautiful it can you pay to go there.
$30 out the door,

3205
02:49:19,530 --> 02:49:24,530
$20 in advance tickets,
a $30 at the door if you actually want 

3206
02:49:24,530 --> 02:49:28,371
to go.
But you can also watch it live for $10 

3207
02:49:28,371 --> 02:49:28,920
online deal deal.
It's a,

3208
02:49:29,190 --> 02:49:34,190
it's a great deal.
And you are contributing to something 

3209
02:49:34,190 --> 02:49:35,580
that is hugely important.
You are part of this whole movement.

3210
02:49:35,850 --> 02:49:37,710
There's something going on folks.
Uh,

3211
02:49:37,770 --> 02:49:39,210
dennis,
you're a huge part of it.

3212
02:49:39,211 --> 02:49:42,240
Josh are a huge part of it.
The people listening to this podcast are

3213
02:49:42,241 --> 02:49:44,580
a huge part of it.
It's all out there and it's moving.

3214
02:49:44,581 --> 02:49:46,410
It's moving in,
I think a good direction.

3215
02:49:46,650 --> 02:49:47,280
I really do

3216
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:52,520
one last plug if I made.
There's a congress that I'm going to 

3217
02:49:52,520 --> 02:49:55,701
next weekend in Mexico to luca,
a bringing together indigenous leaders 

3218
02:49:55,920 --> 02:49:58,110
with a boga,
a pod,

3219
02:49:58,140 --> 02:50:00,840
mushroom,
a iowasca experience,

3220
02:50:00,841 --> 02:50:04,810
and they need funding to attend to bring
more of the,

3221
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:07,440
the traditional healers to that 
conference.

3222
02:50:07,441 --> 02:50:12,441
It's called the the second international
congress on traditional medicine and 

3223
02:50:12,441 --> 02:50:12,960
public health,
sacred plants,

3224
02:50:12,961 --> 02:50:13,950
culture and human rights.

3225
02:50:14,440 --> 02:50:19,000
And is this information all available on
ethno botanical council.org?

3226
02:50:19,060 --> 02:50:20,320
Can you.
Can they find it there?

3227
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:25,920
No,
but I'll change that in the news 

3228
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:26,230
section.
So what the hell?

3229
02:50:26,460 --> 02:50:27,700
What the fuck?
Come on man.

3230
02:50:28,150 --> 02:50:29,770
We're all working together on this 
kitchen.

3231
02:50:29,771 --> 02:50:30,430
Say it.
Well,

3232
02:50:30,431 --> 02:50:33,850
I'd like to say joe also,
thank you for having us on and you,

3233
02:50:34,030 --> 02:50:37,900
you my friend are one of the change 
makers for sure.

3234
02:50:38,590 --> 02:50:40,870
Don't underestimate that.
I mean you're,

3235
02:50:41,980 --> 02:50:44,320
you're a hero of my.
Oh,

3236
02:50:44,321 --> 02:50:46,570
that's a huge honor.
I'm a useful idiot.

3237
02:50:46,840 --> 02:50:51,840
What I am is a no idiot.
I'm a repeat or have things that are 

3238
02:50:52,031 --> 02:50:57,031
fascinating,
but I appreciate that very much and I 

3239
02:50:57,031 --> 02:51:00,390
feel as compelled,
as all of you to try to broadcast as 

3240
02:51:00,390 --> 02:51:04,231
much of what I've stumbled upon and,
and talk about it as much as possible 

3241
02:51:04,260 --> 02:51:05,830
and it's impossible without guys like 
you.

3242
02:51:05,860 --> 02:51:07,570
So thank you all.
Thank you very much.

3243
02:51:07,830 --> 02:51:12,830
Thank you everybody listening to thank 
you for having us thank you to the list 

3244
02:51:12,830 --> 02:51:13,750
or we're all in this shit shit together.
People.

3245
02:51:13,990 --> 02:51:14,840
So,
uh,

3246
02:51:14,890 --> 02:51:17,920
please go to ethno botanical 
council.org.

3247
02:51:18,100 --> 02:51:20,320
Go to symposia with p,
s,

3248
02:51:20,321 --> 02:51:23,150
y symposia.org.
And uh,

3249
02:51:23,440 --> 02:51:28,440
that's it.
We'll be back next week with much more 

3250
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:28,440
