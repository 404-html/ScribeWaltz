1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,410
Three,
two,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:02,843
one.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,100
Here we are again.
Hey Joe.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,220
Hello Jordan.
How are you doing man?

5
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:11,054
I'm doing great.
You have the schedule that you have and 

6
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,374
the amount of energy and enthusiasm you 
maintain what the schedule is very 

7
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:22,490
remarkable because you're not stopping.
You're not slowing down.

8
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:25,430
I mean you've,
you've had your foot on the gas for like

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,270
two solid years now.
Make Hay while the sun shines.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,520
I guess that was what it.
Is that how you feel about it?

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,451
Well,
you know,

12
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:35,930
when you have an opportunity that's 
completely preposterous.

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,260
You're a fool to take it for granted.
I guess.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,253
So

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,543
Sierra,
so tammy and I have been to 100 cities 

16
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,390
since January,
so everywhere,

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,150
you know,
and part of what keeps us going.

18
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:50,770
Well first of all I have a really good 
crew,

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,390
you know,
like the ca guys.

20
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:54,700
They're really good.
Live nation has been really good.

21
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,340
They make sure that the theaters are 
smooth and,

22
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,263
and we've had no problems at all.
And then I have lots of people who are 

23
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:02,884
helping me with my scheduling and Tammy 
travels with me and then the lectures 

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,560
themselves.
Well,

25
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,920
I really like doing them partly because 
I do a different lecture every night and

26
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:12,754
so that keeps me sharp and it makes sure
that I'm thinking about new things all 

27
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:16,324
the time and trying to formulate my 
thoughts more precisely and there are 

28
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:23,560
also unbelievably positive.
So that's also,

29
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,450
that's also something that makes it a 
lot easier to do because you know,

30
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:33,190
I go to a city and there's 1500 to 2000 
people waiting for me there,

31
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:38,191
which is staggering in and of itself 
wherever I go and they're all,

32
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:40,750
they're listening intently and,
and it's,

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,500
it's a sophisticated discussion or at 
least as sophisticated as I can make it.

34
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,830
I'm communicating directly with the 
audience and all the people are there to

35
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:50,350
try to get their lives together.
And so the,

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,320
the,
the feeling in the,

37
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,640
in the hall is really,
really positive.

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,200
And then I usually talk to about 150 
people afterwards and you know,

39
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,780
they're all of them,
all of them.

40
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,123
While many of them they just say hi and 
they're polite and we have a photograph 

41
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:06,784
and all that.
But lots of them have stories about how 

42
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,124
they've been putting their lives 
together and they're thrilled to death 

43
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:11,261
about it.
You know,

44
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:12,094
that they're out of the hole they were 
in or they've started a new business or 

45
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:15,604
they've sold a new business or they just
decided to get married or they're going 

46
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:18,344
to have some kids.
Are they fixed up their relationship 

47
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:22,350
with their parents or they quit drinking
or.

48
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,600
And they're not addicted.
I talked to one guy in Europe,

49
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,883
he'd stop.

50
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,210
He was,
he was addicted.

51
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,060
I don't remember what to,
but it wasn't.

52
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,390
It was something that wasn't good.
He,

53
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,300
he'd stopped for nine months and got 
nine of his friends to quit too.

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,550
So he comes up,
he's just like bouncing,

55
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:37,384
you know,
he's so damn happy that his life is 

56
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:39,890
better at.
Not only that,

57
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:42,610
that he had this additional positive 
effect on other people.

58
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:43,444
So,
and it's so fun because I have these 

59
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:47,560
conversations with people.
They're brief,

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,110
but they're very personal and they're 
very intense,

61
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:51,630
you know,
because they,

62
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,783
they,
you think people have to trust you to 

63
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:57,580
tell you that their lives weren't going 
so well.

64
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,683
And then they have to trust you more to 
tell you that they're going better now 

65
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:01,894
because of course what you want when you
tell someone that things are going 

66
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,214
better is you want real encouragement 
and real sense from the person you're 

67
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:12,130
talking to that they're happy for you.

68
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,230
And I am absolutely thrilled to hear 
these things.

69
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,243
A guy was in whole foods this morning.
I went down near where I'm staying and 

70
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:20,704
two of the guys that work behind the 
meat counter came out to talk to me and 

71
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,993
independently and they'd both been 
reading my books and watching my 

72
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,084
lectures.
And one of them said he at a seven year 

73
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,390
old son,
he really wanted to do right by him.

74
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,373
He was looking for ethical and moral 
guidance and he found the books really 

75
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:37,410
helpful and that it was helping him put 
his life together.

76
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:38,244
And,
and so car guy at the car rental place 

77
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:43,330
last night told me the same thing as,
oh,

78
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:44,164
it's so exciting.
So ridiculously exciting to go 

79
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,513
everywhere around the world and to go 
into airports are to walk down the 

80
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:55,720
street and have people come up and say,
I've been watching you on youtube.

81
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,930
They often mention you.
I've been listening to what you say.

82
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:00,640
I've been developing a vision for my 
life.

83
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,620
It's really helped me out a lot.
Thanks a lot.

84
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,500
And Jesus like to be able to have that 
happen,

85
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,810
you know,
time after time,

86
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,760
day after day,
all over the place.

87
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:13,330
That's just absolutely.
It makes go into 100 cities,

88
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,380
like continually,
uh,

89
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,740
energizing because it's so positive.
And so.

90
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,630
And then there's all this weird crap in 
the press,

91
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:23,464
you know,
about my dangerous followers and all 

92
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:27,340
this outright nonsense.
And it's so ridiculous.

93
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,830
You know,
I've talked to 250,000

94
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:30,664
people in it in seven months.
We haven't had one incident that was 

95
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,360
negative in that entire time.
Not One.

96
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,480
Nothing,
no misbehavior on anyone's part.

97
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,660
We had one heckler who obviously not a 
fan of mine,

98
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,880
given that he was a heckler.
That was it.

99
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,240
Other than that,
the audiences behave perfectly.

100
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:51,310
They all dress up.
They come in suits,

101
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:53,080
which is really cool.
A lot of young guys,

102
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:55,930
they dress up so they have a little suit
competition with me,

103
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:59,350
which is quite fun.
So that's an additional bonus and yeah,

104
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:01,780
it's.
It's pretty damn good joe.

105
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,923
I think it's really fantastic and I 
think what's going on is it makes me 

106
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:07,034
very optimistic because I think that one
of the things that new media has 

107
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:11,684
provided as these new avenues for 
information to get out there and these 

108
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:17,654
new things like these lecture circuits.
When was the last time you saw public 

109
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,843
lecture circuits that were popular to 
the tune of thousands and thousands of 

110
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:26,834
people.
I saw the ones that you and Sam Harris 

111
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:31,850
did on Youtube and you know Sam's doing 
them with a lot of other people as well.

112
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:34,610
You're doing them with a bottle of Jay 
with Dave Rubin as well.

113
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,190
These are the.
I mean this is a very unique thing,

114
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,053
that's for sure.
And also this desire to understand new 

115
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,223
paths of behavior and patterns of 
thinking and that these are corrective 

116
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,940
paths and patterns that can lead you to 
a more fulfilled and happier life.

117
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,163
And recognize the pitfalls of certain 
types of behavior that people just fall 

118
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:57,980
into and I think oftentimes the between 
someone who

119
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,813
lives a fulfilled life and someone who 
lives a life filled with disaster is 

120
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,710
following incorrect patterns and not 
knowing what the correct ones are.

121
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,693
So there's a lot of good people out 
there that lives shitty lives and they 

122
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,534
don't do it because they're.
They're just dumb or because they're 

123
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,073
bad.
They do it because they've been 

124
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,520
influenced by certain patterns.
They fallen into patterns,

125
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:20,354
whether it's because of the people that 
they surround themselves with or the 

126
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,700
neighborhood that grew up,
the people that are around them and have

127
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,534
this way of being and they kind of fall 
into that or it's drugs or alcohol or 

128
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:30,284
whatever it is,
but then they find a new one and then 

129
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:33,494
they can slide right into that new one 
and all of a sudden they feel energized 

130
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:36,914
and they wake up in the morning instead 
of hung over there getting exercise in 

131
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:40,460
there,
eating healthy.

132
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,413
They're starting to think about things 
correctly and do good things in the 

133
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:44,684
momentum of them.
Doing those good things leads them to 

134
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:49,860
feel good about themselves and energized
and this,

135
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,773
these are all things that you promote 
and then I think are genuinely really 

136
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,290
significant,
really important,

137
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,680
but he gets.
But the thing is a gets maligned.

138
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,680
It gets you get pushed into this weird 
one,

139
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,543
but if what we were talking about before
the podcast by a small select group of 

140
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:08,894
people,
it's a very small but vocal minority 

141
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,363
that wants to misrepresent you and then 
there's the periphery that listen to 

142
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:21,470
this small group and then they sort of 
pair it those words out without any real

143
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:23,360
thinking about what you've said.
Well,

144
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,194
you know,
one of the things that I have made a 

145
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:29,300
mistake about in the past that I just 
realized in the last couple of weeks was

146
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:30,170
that,
you know,

147
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:32,810
people often accused me and they say,
well,

148
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,820
most of the people that listened to you 
are men.

149
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,700
And I think that,
you know,

150
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,500
when you're accused like that,
your automatic responses.

151
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,334
Well,
you wouldn't be accused if you weren't 

152
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:41,774
doing something wrong.
So there must be something wrong about 

153
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:43,851
that.
It's like,

154
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:46,490
why isn't it 50 percent women?
And so I've said things like,

155
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:47,390
well,
you know,

156
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:50,060
80 percent of the people who watch 
youtube videos are men.

157
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,530
And so the fact that 80 percent of the 
people who watch my videos are men.

158
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,570
Isn't that surprising given that base 
rate?

159
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,270
But then about three weeks ago I started
thinking,

160
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,690
well,
what,

161
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,220
what the hell am I doing?
It's like,

162
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,100
what?
Is there some wrong with talking to men?

163
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,390
Is that actually a problem?
So like I'm trying to,

164
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,553
I'm trying,
I mean I didn't set out to do that 

165
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:09,314
specifically,
but if that's the way it's working out 

166
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:12,920
and,
and there is a majority of men coming to

167
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:13,754
my shows say then is that,
why is that s all of a sudden supposed 

168
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:18,914
to be a bad thing?

169
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,110
I'm asking men to,
you know,

170
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:21,944
to be more honest and especially in 
their speech and their thinking and to 

171
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:29,810
be more responsible for themselves and 
for their family and for their community

172
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,033
and to grow up and to shoulder their 
burden and to live a responsible and 

173
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:35,054
meaningful life.
And putting those two things together 

174
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:37,610
conceptually.
And it's like.

175
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,850
And then there's an accusation about 
that is if there's something wrong.

176
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:41,870
And I thought,
well,

177
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,810
why am I even playing into this?
It's like,

178
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,350
fine,
I'm talking to men,

179
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,453
I'm encouraging them and I am absolutely
thrilled every time someone comes up to 

180
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:50,894
me,
um,

181
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,590
and that's happening.
I may be a 100 times a week or something

182
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:56,040
like that and tells me one

183
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,710
of these stories about how they put 
their life together.

184
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:01,200
It's like I'm absolutely thrilled about 
that.

185
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:06,201
And so I don't see,
it's just a sign of how pathological our

186
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:07,284
times have become in some sense that 
there would have been any guilt about 

187
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:12,360
that to begin with because how is that 
not a good thing,

188
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:13,710
man?
It's weird.

189
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,701
Uh,
I think,

190
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:15,534
uh,
a lot of that has to do with this 

191
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:17,454
concept that men are running everything 
and that men have this massive 

192
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:20,844
advantage.
There's a white male advantage and 

193
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:23,034
privilege that we all enjoy and share 
and that men have this advantage 

194
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:30,150
financially.
There's disparity in terms of the gender

195
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:35,151
gap in pay and income and that if you 
were really a good person,

196
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,953
you would be looking out.
He would be trying to balance that out 

197
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,270
and then you wouldn't be trying to pump 
up the winning team.

198
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,731
Well,
that's it,

199
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:47,100
and that's part of that narrative that,
well,

200
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:49,650
if there's winners there,
there has to be losers,

201
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:50,484
and the reason that there are losers is 
because there's winners and that's 

202
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:55,840
complete bloody nonsense because as far 
as I'm concerned that,

203
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,850
and I really believe this,
is that every single person who sets out

204
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:04,260
to put themselves together ethically is 
a net positive to everyone around them.

205
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,470
There's no downside to that.
You know,

206
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,050
my book has been criticized by people 
who've read it very poorly,

207
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:10,884
especially chapter one,
when I talk about hierarchies that I'm 

208
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:14,994
somehow supporting the idea that power 
in a hierarchy is the right way to be 

209
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:23,150
and there's absolutely nothing in what 
I've written that suggest that at all.

210
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,173
I'm suggesting that human hierarchies 
are very complex and that the way that 

211
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:32,601
you win in a human hierarchy is by being
competent and reciprocal and so and so.

212
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,190
I mean,
for example,

213
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,173
even if you're selfish,
let's say you got to think very 

214
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,624
carefully about what that would mean.
If you were selfish and awake because 

215
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,013
you have to work to take care of 
yourself and what you want say in this 

216
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:47,424
moment,
but then there's you tomorrow and 

217
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:51,440
there's you next week and there's you 
next month,

218
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,090
next year and 10 years from now and when
you're old.

219
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,200
So because you're self conscious and 
because you're aware of the future,

220
00:10:58,201 --> 00:10:59,034
you're actually a community unto 
yourself and if you're selfish and 

221
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:03,114
impulsive,
all that means is that you're serving 

222
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,543
the person you are right now.
You know in that impulsive way but not 

223
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:11,580
the person you are going to be.
And so that's not a good grounds for any

224
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:12,414
sort of ethical behavior.
And I see that if you serve yourself 

225
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:16,134
properly,
there's no difference between serving 

226
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:20,610
your family properly in serving your 
community properly.

227
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,700
That those things all mesh in a kind of 
a harmonious manner.

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,833
And one of the things that's really been
effective in the lecture tour is a 

229
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:29,214
discussion about that idea and its 
relationship between the relationship 

230
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:35,640
between that and meaning and 
responsibility.

231
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:40,641
Because one of the things that strikes 
the audience's silent constantly because

232
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:42,470
I'm always listening to them to see,
you know,

233
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,313
when,
when the attention is maximally focused 

234
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,624
is whenever I pointed out to people that
the antidote to the meaninglessness of 

235
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:50,724
their life and the suffering and the 
malevolence that they might be 

236
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,230
displaying because they're resentful and
bitter about how things have turned out.

237
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,363
The antidote to that is to take on more 
responsibility for themselves and for 

238
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:03,100
other people and that that's 
aspirational,

239
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,780
which is Kinda cool.
You know,

240
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,763
the conservative types,
the duty types and I'm not complaining 

241
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:09,370
about them,
you know,

242
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,230
they're basically saying,
well,

243
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,460
this is how you should act because in 
some sense that's your duty,

244
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:15,670
right?

245
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,760
That's how a good citizen would act.
And that's a reasonable argument.

246
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:21,130
But the case that I've been making is 
more of that.

247
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,900
Well,
there is a,

248
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,180
there is value distinctions between 
things.

249
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,300
Some things are worth doing and some 
things aren't.

250
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:29,134
And you can kind of discover what that 
is for yourself and then you should aim 

251
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:32,644
at the things that are most worth doing.
And what you'll find if you watch 

252
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:36,694
carefully,
is that the things that you find worth 

253
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:43,660
doing are almost always associated with 
an increase in responsibility.

254
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,700
Because if you think about the people 
you admire,

255
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,953
for example,
you spontaneously admire people and 

256
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,234
that's a manifestation of the instinct.
Imitate getting people are very 

257
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,374
imitative.
You don't admire people who don't take 

258
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:57,370
care of themselves,
like unless there's something wrong with

259
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:57,761
you,
you,

260
00:12:57,761 --> 00:13:02,230
you at least want an admirable person to
be accountable for themselves.

261
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,453
And then if they've got something 
leftover so they can be accountable for 

262
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:07,000
their family,
well then that's a net.

263
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:07,834
Plus obviously that's someone you think 
is solid and then maybe they take care 

264
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,720
of some more people.
They have a business or they're involved

265
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:16,210
in the community in some positive way.
You see,

266
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:19,870
well that's a person who's pattern of 
being is worth imitating.

267
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,063
And so and that's all associated with 
responsibility and it's so interesting 

268
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:28,180
because it's as if it's as if everybody 
kind of knows this,

269
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:30,340
but that it hasn't crystallized.
It's like,

270
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,830
well,
you should be responsible because that's

271
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:34,450
what a good citizen is.
It's known,

272
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,293
oh,
you should be responsible because you 

273
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:40,330
need to have a deep meaning in your life
to offset the suffering so you don't get

274
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,480
bitter and the way you do that is to 
bear a heavy load,

275
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,530
you know,
to get yourself in check for you now and

276
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,364
for you in the future and then to do the
same for your family and your community 

277
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,980
and that there's real nobility in that 
and there's real meaning and more.

278
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,840
The other thing that I've been 
suggesting to people,

279
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:59,140
and I also believe this is that,
and I think that the guys that have come

280
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:00,940
to talk to me,
especially the ones that have had real,

281
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,130
real rough lives,
they really understand this.

282
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,820
If you don't get your act together and 
you let yourself slide,

283
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,800
then what kind of moves in to take the 
place of what you could have been.

284
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:13,660
It's something that's really not good at
all.

285
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,770
So it's not only that if you're living a
like a dissolute life,

286
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,963
that you're not aiming at anything 
positive and so you don't have any real 

287
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:24,910
meaning and your subsumed by anxiety and
all of that hopelessness.

288
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,450
But something kind of hellish moves in 
there to,

289
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,740
to,
to occupy that place and so then you end

290
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:32,290
up making things worse.
And when you know,

291
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,860
one of the things I learned about 
studying totalitarian systems,

292
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,230
whether they were on the right or the 
left,

293
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:42,370
was that part of the reason that the 
totalitarian horrors of the 20th century

294
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:46,060
manifested themselves was because 
average people didn't take on the proper

295
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:48,400
responsibility.
They shut their eyes when they're,

296
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:52,010
I should have been open even though they
knew it and they did and said things

297
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,510
they knew they shouldn't have done and 
said.

298
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,000
And that was what supported those 
horrible systems.

299
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,320
So if you don't get your act together,
then you leave a little space for hell.

300
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,513
And I really believe that.
Don't you think when things are 

301
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:06,740
happening like something like Nazi 
Germany,

302
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:10,880
I would imagine that during that time,
the people that were not in supportive,

303
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,360
it felt helpless.
Whether you're in Germany,

304
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:15,194
you're a part of this country,
this country is turning towards this 

305
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,610
horrible situation where Jewish people 
are being put on trains.

306
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:23,444
And you know,
the people that didn't speak out in 

307
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,884
that,
I don't necessarily know if it's a lack 

308
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:34,781
of discipline or just complete fear and 
paralysis and fear for sure.

309
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:36,501
I mean,
you know,

310
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:41,270
knowledge of how to deal with it or to 
wanting to protect your family as well.

311
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,640
So wanting to step out of line.
Absolutely.

312
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,503
Oh well that's the thing.
The problem is that if you're going to 

313
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:48,344
forestall that sort of thing,
you have to do it early enough because 

314
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,210
the longer you wait,
the higher the price you pay for it.

315
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,103
But it's hard to take that jump early 
because you're not exactly sure where 

316
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:58,580
it's going.
That's true.

317
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,610
And you're not well and you're also 
likely to be jumped on.

318
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,650
I mean you can see that happening in our
own culture.

319
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:04,484
You know,
you make a mistake on twitter or even 

320
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,200
something that isn't a mistake and you 
know,

321
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,034
you can pay a well what feels to be a 
pretty high price or whether it is a 

322
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:13,544
high price or not.
It's hard to tell because twitter is so 

323
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,700
weirdly fictional,
you know,

324
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:21,701
it's so hard to to get your to get a 
grasp on exactly what's going on.

325
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,050
Let's say it's also your comprehension 
of what.

326
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,080
What is the emotional reaction to people
that you don't know being mean to you?

327
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,320
Like this is like,
what is that price and people.

328
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:37,220
Some people want to dismiss that as 
being not just nothing.

329
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,500
It's not that big a deal,
but it is a big deal.

330
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:42,110
It causes people to commit suicide.
I mean it has.

331
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:42,944
Absolutely.
Bullying online has caused many people 

332
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,190
to commit suicide.
Well,

333
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,040
the thing is,
you know,

334
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:46,874
when you.
The weird thing about that online 

335
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,574
communication is that like I find that I
tend to react to a negative twitter 

336
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:57,890
comment as if it's someone sitting 
across from me talking to me that I know

337
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,143
now it's not and I don't even know if 
the person is real or because their 

338
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,490
accounts are often anonymous.
Right?

339
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:09,110
So that person isn't really real,
but your emotional responses still.

340
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,243
Well,
someone's gone out of their way to be 

341
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:13,020
harshly critical to you.

342
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,173
You know,
and that doesn't happen that often in 

343
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:19,400
your day to day life and so you know,
if you're a reasonable person,

344
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,773
you're very sensitive to criticism 
because it's rare and because you might 

345
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:25,214
be wrong,
especially if there's a lot of people 

346
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:27,404
criticizing you because he kind of has 
to be psychopathic in order to just to 

347
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,730
brush that off.
You know,

348
00:17:30,731 --> 00:17:33,800
it's like 100 people think I'm wrong.
There's nothing to that.

349
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,843
It's like,
well if it's 100 people out of 100 

350
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,790
million but you can't tell on twitter,
then it's irrelevant.

351
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,850
But if it's a mob of 100 people that 
show up outside your house,

352
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:45,890
which is quite kind of what twitter 
feels like,

353
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:46,880
then you think,
well God,

354
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:47,714
you know,
I must have done something wrong 

355
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,390
otherwise,
why would all these people be here?

356
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,653
You know?
And I think that's why so many people 

357
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,380
are driven to apologize.

358
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,520
You know,
when they,

359
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,353
when they do something on twitter or do 
something and then the twitter mobs go 

360
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:02,340
after them,
they think,

361
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:03,990
Oh God,
I must've done something wrong.

362
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:05,070
I should,
I should,

363
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,870
you know,
do some soul searching.

364
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:09,690
And so some of that's not even fear,
it's more like,

365
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,010
it's in a sense,
it's a morality that's misplaced because

366
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:17,250
of our inability to calibrate the social
messaging.

367
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,353
I mean,
I've stopped almost completely stopped 

368
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,083
reading twitter comments in the last 
month and I'm definitely better for it 

369
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,110
to happier.
Oh yeah.

370
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:29,340
It's just,
it's too much.

371
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,230
It's too much.
It's too crazy.

372
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,073
Yeah.
Is your number up to now the number of 

373
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,920
followers,
but a million on twitter.

374
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,360
That's when it's about time to get out 
of dodge.

375
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,071
Yeah.
Yeah.

376
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:38,904
Well,
I mean I'm still following people in 

377
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:42,600
reading what people are posting,
but no,

378
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:43,740
the comments,
I'm just,

379
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,730
I'm just not worth it.

380
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,593
No,
it's not.

381
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,880
And,
and I think it does have something to do

382
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:48,714
with the technology itself.
Like I do believe that that small limit 

383
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,190
facilitates angry,
impulsive,

384
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:57,740
responding,
perhaps souls,

385
00:18:57,741 --> 00:18:59,070
you trying to get people to respond to 
you.

386
00:18:59,071 --> 00:18:59,904
But the alternative is facebook where 
you have these long posts that are just 

387
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,880
rambling first drafts that people put 
out.

388
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,930
Like when it was,
when I started ranting about politics or

389
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:14,730
what have you,
I just can't get involved.

390
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,120
They're just too big and then people 
jump in and comment on them,

391
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,250
and often their comments are massive as 
well.

392
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,353
It's just too verbose.
Whereas the good thing about twitter is 

393
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:28,560
it makes you boil down what you're 
trying to say to a very succinct thing.

394
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,370
Although I do enjoy when someone has a 
good twitter thread,

395
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,710
like there was a really good twitter 
thread.

396
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,640
What was that gentleman's name?

397
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,750
Respectable lawyer to belong.
Respectable law.

398
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,943
He wrote a long history of the sentinel.
These people that are uncontacted tribe 

399
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,310
in the Indian see where they,
uh,

400
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,303
the gentleman went there to try to 
commission your Christianity and shot 

401
00:19:53,781 --> 00:19:54,930
him four arrows.
Yeah.

402
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,020
And he wrote this long history of these 
people and what kind of,

403
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:00,420
what they've had to endure with being,
you know,

404
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,860
a few people going to them and doing 
some awful things and diseases and stuff

405
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:05,810
like that.
So I,

406
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:08,250
I enjoy when someone will do that,
like these long,

407
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,310
like every now and then someone will use
it in a novel way.

408
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,870
I really liked that.
But there's um,

409
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,273
you know,
a lot of it is just people just trying 

410
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:17,064
to get a reaction and what's the 
reaction they can get by pissing you 

411
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:20,100
off.
That's like the best one.

412
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:20,963
Well,
they also might be the ones that are 

413
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:22,824
most like,
we don't know exactly know what 

414
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:25,044
motivates people to respond on twitter.
And it might be that the fundamental 

415
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:29,874
motivation for twitter response is anger
rather than the desire to share 

416
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:34,914
something because we don't know anything
about how these new communication 

417
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,824
techniques function psychologically.
Like maybe twitter is skewed 90 percent 

418
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:44,010
towards people who are impulsively angry
at that moment.

419
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,940
It could easily be,
we don't know,

420
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,501
like,
you know,

421
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:48,280
if you're driving

422
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,200
in your car and someone cuts you off,
you curse,

423
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,970
you know,
or at least I do.

424
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,033
And it's often a situational issue 
rather than a personality flaw on the 

425
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,740
part of the other driver.
Even though it's easy to assume that,

426
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,903
but you respond impulsively.
I mean God only knows how much of our 

427
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:05,104
social media networks are setup to 
differentially reward impulsive 

428
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:09,994
behavior.
And it's also not that easy to hold 

429
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:16,390
people accountable in some sense.
And maybe there's some utility to that,

430
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:18,640
but with anonymous accounts and all of 
that,

431
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:23,110
the anonymisity immunity is also 
problematic because it certainly enables

432
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,080
people to allow their worst to manifest 
themselves,

433
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,970
especially if they're resentful and 
angry.

434
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,403
So the only benefit that I can see to 
anonymity is it gives you the 

435
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:35,880
opportunity to explore controversial 
ideas without true,

436
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
true,
I think used correctly.

437
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,201
Well,
that's it.

438
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:39,280
I think that that's true.

439
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,113
I think there's some utility.
I mean I don't think that it should be 

440
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:44,500
forbidden,
but well,

441
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:45,334
like most things it's,
it has its advantages and its 

442
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,640
disadvantages.
Like most things,

443
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,320
it's not entirely negative to be 
anonymous.

444
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:51,154
Okay.
So I figured something out that I 

445
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:52,654
thought I'd tell you about just took me 
like 30 years to figure out and I 

446
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:58,210
figured it out on this tour.
So there's this old idea,

447
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:00,130
you know,
that you have to rescue your father from

448
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:01,450
the belly of the whale,
right?

449
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,120
From some monster that's deep in the 
abyss.

450
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,780
You see that in Pinocchio for example.
But it's a very common idea.

451
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,590
And I figured out why that is.
I think so.

452
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,933
Imagine that we already know from a 
clinical perspective that you know if 

453
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,434
you set out a path towards a goal which 
you want to do because you need a goal 

454
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:24,250
and you need a path because that 
provides you with positive emotion,

455
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:24,460
right?

456
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,810
So you set up something as valuable,
so that implies a hierarchy is set up,

457
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:29,644
something as valuable.
You decide that you're going to do that 

458
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,434
instead of other things,
so that's kind of a sacrifice because 

459
00:22:34,391 --> 00:22:35,224
you're sacrificing everything else to 
pursue that and then you experienced a 

460
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:39,244
fair bit of positive emotion and meaning
as you watch yourself move towards the 

461
00:22:41,951 --> 00:22:42,784
goal.
And so the implication of that is the 

462
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,160
better the goal,
the the more full enrich your experience

463
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:51,100
is going to be when you pursue it.
So that's one of the reasons have.

464
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,253
That's one of the reasons for developing
a vision and for fleshing yourself out 

465
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,510
philosophically because you want to aim 
at the highest goal that you can manage.

466
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,430
Okay?
So you do that,

467
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,940
and then what you'll find is that as you
move towards the goal,

468
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:05,340
there are certain things that,
that,

469
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,600
that you have to accomplish that 
frighten you.

470
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,753
You know,
maybe you have to learn to be a better 

471
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:11,080
speaker,
a better writer,

472
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:11,914
a better thinker.
You have to be better to people around 

473
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:14,464
you,
where you have to learn some new skills 

474
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:16,960
and you're afraid of that,
whatever,

475
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,370
because it's going to stretch you if 
you,

476
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:22,000
if you pursue a goal and it's so,
that'll put you up against challenges.

477
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,480
Okay?
So all the clinical data indicates,

478
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,433
well,
the opposite of safe spaces as Jonathan 

479
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,923
Heit has been pointing out that what you
want to do when you identify something 

480
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:33,814
that someone is avoiding,
that they need to do because they're 

481
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,360
afraid.
You have them voluntary,

482
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,200
voluntarily confronted,
and so you break it down.

483
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,240
What you try to do,
if you're a behavior therapist,

484
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:44,074
as you break down the thing,
they're avoiding to smaller and smaller 

485
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:48,860
pieces until you find a piece that's 
small enough.

486
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,840
So they'll do it and it doesn't really 
matter.

487
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,673
As long as they start it,
they can put the next piece on in the 

488
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:54,974
next piece,
and what happens is they don't get less 

489
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:58,290
afraid.
Exactly.

490
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:00,020
They get braver,
they get.

491
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,020
It's like there's more of you can and 
here's why.

492
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:08,021
So imagine you do something new and 
that's informative,

493
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,193
right?
There's information in the action and 

494
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:13,820
then you can incorporate that 
information and turn it into a skill and

495
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:14,654
turn it into a transformation of your 
perceptions so there's more to you 

496
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:20,390
because you've tried something new.
So that's one thing,

497
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,690
but the second thing is there's good 
biological evidence for this now that if

498
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:31,001
you put yourself in a new situation,
then new genes code for new proteins and

499
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:35,030
build new neural structures and new 
nervous system structures.

500
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,130
Same thing happens to some degree when 
you work out,

501
00:24:37,131 --> 00:24:37,964
right?
Because your muscles are responding to 

502
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:41,630
the lote,
but your nervous system does that too.

503
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,420
So you imagine that there's a lot of 
potential.

504
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:49,421
You locked in your genetic code and then
if you put yourself in a new situation,

505
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,443
then then the stress,
that's the situational stress that's 

506
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:56,540
produced by that particular situation 
unlocks those genes.

507
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:57,374
And then builds new parts of you,
and so that's very cool because who 

508
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:02,720
knows how much there is locked inside of
you.

509
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,310
Okay,
so now here's the idea.

510
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,953
So let's assume that that scales,
as you take on heavier and heavier 

511
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:12,860
loads,
that more and more of you,

512
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,753
you get more and more informed because 
you're doing more and more difficult 

513
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:18,260
things,
but more and more of you gets unlocked.

514
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,203
And so then what that would imply is 
that if you got to the point where you 

515
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:26,570
could look at the darkest thing,
so that would be the abyss,

516
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:28,120
right?
That would be the deepest abyss.

517
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,963
If you could look at the harshest things
like the most brutal parts of the 

518
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:35,540
suffering of the world and the 
malevolence of people in society.

519
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,490
If you could look that,
look at that straight and directly,

520
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,743
that that would turn you on maximally.
And so that's the idea of rescuing your 

521
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:46,664
father.
Because imagine that you're like the 

522
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:49,424
potential composite of all your,
all of the ancestral wisdom that's 

523
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:54,404
locked inside of you biologically.
But that's not going to come out at all 

524
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,410
unless you stress yourself,
unless you,

525
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:03,770
unless you challenge yourself and the 
bigger the challenge you take on,

526
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,604
the more that's going to turn on and so 
that as you take on a broader and 

527
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:08,984
broader range of challenges and you push
yourself harder than more and more of 

528
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:17,090
what you could be turns on and that's 
equivalent to transforming yourself into

529
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:20,050
the ancestral father into all because 
you're,

530
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,920
you're like the,
what would you call it,

531
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:22,754
your,
the consequences of all these living 

532
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,753
beings that have come before you and 
that's all part of your biological 

533
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:30,800
potentiality.

534
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,873
And then if you can push yourself,
then all of that clicks on and that 

535
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:36,540
turns you into who you could be.
That's an,

536
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:40,280
that's the re representation of that 
positive ancestral father.

537
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,130
So that's why you rescue your father 
from the belly of the beast.

538
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,500
So you think that this ultimate goal of 
sack of sacrifice and of,

539
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:53,871
of risking your life in order to save 
someone who's truly important to you,

540
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,680
that this somehow or another maximizes 
your potential as a human being?

541
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,351
Well,
I think,

542
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,184
I think you can think about it 
religiously to so think about it this 

543
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:03,520
way.
So in,

544
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,310
in the Christian story,
for example,

545
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:07,980
you have Christ does two things that are
met.

546
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:12,981
Messianic one is takes the suffering of 
the world onto himself.

547
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,480
He's not weird idea.
Okay,

548
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:17,790
so what does that mean?
Let's think about it psychologically.

549
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:21,570
Well maybe it means that,
well that's your job is the world's full

550
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:25,380
of suffering and you should accept that 
as your responsibility past,

551
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:26,280
present,
and future.

552
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,413
You're supposed to do something about 
that as much as you can about it and 

553
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,970
maybe you start with your own localized 
suffering,

554
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:34,260
you know,
put yourself together,

555
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,900
but then you expand that outward and you
decide that it's,

556
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,520
you're not a victim of that even though 
you know your part and parcel of it,

557
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,210
but you're,
you're the potential solution to that.

558
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,460
And so you accept that as a 
responsibility.

559
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,590
So that's part of taking on load.
That's part of burying across.

560
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,563
You could look at it that way.
The cross is sort of a symbol of the 

561
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:55,770
place of maximal suffering.
Okay?

562
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:58,880
So you accept that as a challenge.
Not as a,

563
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,350
not as something that you're victimized 
by.

564
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,270
Maybe you accept that as the price of 
being.

565
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,440
Okay,
so that's one.

566
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:09,150
That's one responsibility you're 
responsible for addressing the suffering

567
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:09,984
in the world,
so that could give you some meaning 

568
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,113
seemed to me.

569
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,090
Then the next thing is there's a story.
Of course,

570
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:15,924
the Christ met the devil in the desert 
and so that's the encounter with 

571
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:20,190
malevolence,
so that would be the other thing because

572
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:23,550
the two major problems that people face 
obviously are suffering,

573
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,533
tragedy and malevolence,
and so that's the other thing that 

574
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:27,834
you're responsible for is that you're 
supposed to look at the capacity for 

575
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:33,540
human evil as clearly as you possibly 
can.

576
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,230
It's a very terrifying thing.
You know,

577
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,083
that causes posttraumatic stress 
disorder and people that aren't 

578
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,233
accustomed to it and in the mythologies 
that's associated with the encounter 

579
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:42,924
with evil,
it's almost always the case that the 

580
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:49,470
entity that does the encountering,
even if it does it voluntarily,

581
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,850
is is,
is hurt by it.

582
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,400
So the Egyptian God Horus,
for example,

583
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,790
who's the I and the Falcon,
the thing that can see and pay attention

584
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,320
when he encounters is evil.

585
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,660
Uncle Seth,
who's the precursor of Satan,

586
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,280
he loses an eye because it's no joke to 
encounter malevolence you know it.

587
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,143
It can really shake you,
but the idea would be that if you can 

588
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:15,240
face the malevolence and you can face 
the suffering,

589
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,253
then that maximally that opens the door 
to your maximum potential and then the 

590
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:24,650
option.
The optimistic part of that is this is,

591
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,480
this is why it's so useful to peer into 
the darkness.

592
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:28,314
Let's say the optimistic part of that is
is that although the suffering is great 

593
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:32,664
and the malevolence is his deep,
your capacity to transcendent is 

594
00:29:36,361 --> 00:29:40,770
stronger,
so what you get out of the most negative

595
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,613
viewpoint is the most positive possible 
consequence because one of the things 

596
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:45,154
you'd like to know if you want it to 
know something deep about yourself is 

597
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:49,120
that you could face the worst.
That there wasn't prevail,

598
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,880
and I believe that's.
I believe that's correct.

599
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,100
I believe that,
that people are capable of that.

600
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,570
I think that despite how tragic life is 
and how malevolent things are,

601
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,140
that fundamentally our spirit,
let's say,

602
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,500
has the capacity to to confront that and
to fix it like psychologically,

603
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,013
to to confronted courageously,
to be able to bear up under that if you 

604
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:13,024
do it voluntarily,
but also to address it not only to deal 

605
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:17,290
with it psychologically,
but to deal with it practically,

606
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,120
and that we could make things much 
better.

607
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,430
There's always

608
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,230
striving towards utopia,
right?

609
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:25,860
Like this is the ultimate goal that if 
you ask people,

610
00:30:25,861 --> 00:30:27,580
what would you like out of civilization?
Well,

611
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,423
I'd like everyone to be happy and 
everyone to get along and there'd be no 

612
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:30,930
war.
Nothing,

613
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:32,070
no suffering,
no anything,

614
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:37,470
but in order to really truly learn about
yourself and about life,

615
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:39,870
you have to overcome adversity.
You have to experience things,

616
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,220
and I firmly believe that in order to 
truly appreciate love,

617
00:30:44,221 --> 00:30:45,054
you have to understand.
I really have felt hate and to really 

618
00:30:48,571 --> 00:30:51,300
appreciate comradery.
You have to feel loneliness.

619
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:54,510
So this is just a part of being a person
for whatever reason.

620
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,491
Yeah.
Well,

621
00:30:55,491 --> 00:30:56,324
maybe you see,
the other thing that I've been thinking 

622
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,680
along the same lines is that,
you know,

623
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,960
it isn't so in the,
in the biblical stories,

624
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,060
in Abrahamic Stories,
for example,

625
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,760
Abraham basically hangs around his dad's
tent.

626
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:08,643
He's like 80.
He's one of these guys that fails to 

627
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:10,821
launch,
you know,

628
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:11,654
in a big way.
And God eventually gets sick and tired 

629
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:14,690
of him like,
you know,

630
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,553
playing video games in his basement and 
says get the hell out there into the 

631
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:20,990
world and have life.
And so he does.

632
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:21,824
He leaves this,
his father's tent in his community and 

633
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,840
his and his country,
which is what he's commanded to do.

634
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,640
And then he goes out and has an 
adventure,

635
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:29,474
but you know,
the first thing he encounters is a 

636
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:34,190
famine and then he encounters a tyranny 
and then he encounters a bunch of people

637
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,530
in the state that want to take his wife.

638
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,490
And so you can imagine the Abraham's 
response to that is like,

639
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,100
it was a hell of a lot better sitting in
my dad's tent playing video games.

640
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,323
But what's cool about that story,
what I realized when I was doing the 

641
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:49,340
lectures on it last year,
was that that was a call to adventure,

642
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,451
you know,
and,

643
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:53,780
and that the right way of 
conceptualizing what we're talking about

644
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:57,660
isn't that utopia would be a place where
everyone was happy because,

645
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,513
because,
and I think because of what you just 

646
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,540
laid out is you need that polarity,
you know,

647
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:06,710
and people need a load and we need 
adversity and we need difficulty.

648
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,300
We need all of that.
Um,

649
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,943
so maybe what you want is an adventure,
the greatest adventure that you could 

650
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:14,660
have and that would involve,
you know,

651
00:32:14,661 --> 00:32:17,630
something to push against it would 
involve real challenge.

652
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,643
And so just to seek that Dostoevsky knew
this because when he wrote notes from 

653
00:32:22,851 --> 00:32:23,684
underground,
which I would highly recommend to 

654
00:32:24,531 --> 00:32:25,364
everyone who's listening,
it's a great book and it's a very short 

655
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:27,584
book.

656
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:28,963
He,
he criticized socialist utopia back in 

657
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,990
18,
60 weight way before it became this sort

658
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:38,240
of widespread idea that,
that it is now.

659
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,730
And what does the FCC said was that,
well,

660
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,190
human beings are these very peculiar 
creatures.

661
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:44,024
And if you gave us a utopia so that we 
had nothing to do but eat cake and busy 

662
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:50,390
ourself with the continuation of the 
species,

663
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:51,680
that was,
that was his line,

664
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:52,883
um,
that the first thing we do is smash it 

665
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:56,950
all to bits,
just so that something unexpected and,

666
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,853
and troublesome would happen because 
we're built for adventure and not for 

667
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,910
peace and happiness.

668
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,650
Lower designed to overcome the natural 
world.

669
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,783
The natural world is filled with that 
natural world is filled with things 

670
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:11,340
trying to eat.
And this is just everywhere you look.

671
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:12,174
That's all you observed.
You observed predators and prey and 

672
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:15,840
animals eating vegetables.
And that's it.

673
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,273
And I think that this,
this concept of overcoming adversity so 

674
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,953
it's so human.
It's so a part of what we are that I 

675
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:27,720
want to bring it back to you because one
of the things that I've been considering

676
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,613
is that I've said this many times and I 
just had a conversation with my good 

677
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:33,930
friend Steve Rinella the other day where
he brought it up independently.

678
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,943
He said,
I think Jordan Peterson is the most 

679
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:38,520
misunderstood and misinterpreted guy in 
the world.

680
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,890
He's like,
people are always like,

681
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,030
not just Mrs,
but,

682
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,660
but misstating what you believe in 
misstating what you say,

683
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,360
this opposition to you.

684
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,570
This,
uh,

685
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,403
I mean,
like we were talking about this gq 

686
00:33:51,871 --> 00:33:54,180
interview,
which I thought was a,

687
00:33:54,181 --> 00:33:57,630
I thought that one was a far more 
intelligent than the.

688
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,733
And her approach was far better and far 
more reasoned and well thought out than 

689
00:34:02,851 --> 00:34:03,684
some of the other attacks on you before.
So the bringing in the varsity level 

690
00:34:05,971 --> 00:34:07,190
players is what I'm saying.
It's like,

691
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,603
but I think this is important.
I think this is part of what with what 

692
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:17,990
forges this message is that you are and 
you,

693
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,850
you,
and this.

694
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:19,683
One of the things that,
uh,

695
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,553
Eric Weinstein and I had said about you,
is that you're essentially the hoists 

696
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:25,584
Gracie of the intellectual dark web have
you don't know what that means is the 

697
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,693
early days of the UFC,
no one knew what the best martial art 

698
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:34,374
was.
And the idea was like it was all these 

699
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,073
martial arts that are running around 
independently and that they were all 

700
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,090
claiming that they had the best 
technique.

701
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,740
And let's see what happens.
And hoists.

702
00:34:43,741 --> 00:34:44,574
Gracie was the one who represented 
Jujitsu and went out there and beat all 

703
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:51,840
these people with superior technique and
superior strategy.

704
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,250
South American?
Yes.

705
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:55,220
He's from Brazil.
I know about him.

706
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:56,054
Yeah.
And he launched this Brazilian Ju and 

707
00:34:58,381 --> 00:35:02,730
his family launched his Brazilian 
Jujitsu Empire that has since taken over

708
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:03,564
the world of martial arts.
But you are the one who's consistently 

709
00:35:07,081 --> 00:35:09,560
engaging in these people.
You're the one who's involved.

710
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,413
These valley tuto events where you're 
debating these people who are coming at 

711
00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:14,964
you hostile with notes and I think is as
uncomfortable as those moments are like 

712
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,390
who was the woman that said so what 
you're trying to say?

713
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,630
Kathy Newman.
Yeah.

714
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,900
Her.
I think her approach,

715
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,080
I think she misunder estimated you.
I think she underestimated you.

716
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:29,914
I think she misinterpreted who you are 
and she thought that she could come at 

717
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:37,380
you with this Straw man sorta article 
and Oh,

718
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,100
argument.

719
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,570
Rather than frame your positions in a 
very unflattering way,

720
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,220
it just didn't work.
It was.

721
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,360
It was like the early days of hoists.
Gracie guys would come out,

722
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:49,200
I'm flailing and get them in an arm bar 
and they tap out and they'd go,

723
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:50,910
fuck,
that's Kinda what happened with you.

724
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,170
But now this woman who you had this 
conversation with in Gq,

725
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,410
she was much more skilled.
She was better verbally.

726
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,400
She's shooting her arguments have been 
more sense to seem more reasonable,

727
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:03,234
more well read.
She was able to think on her feet 

728
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:05,874
quicker,
but still these are really important 

729
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,570
conversations.
Well it

730
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:14,340
was a funny day because I went to the,
to the hotel room in Baltimore,

731
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,523
you know,
and I went out of my way to do it and 

732
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,100
she was hostile to me the second I 
walked into the room.

733
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,120
Really?
Yes.

734
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:23,600
And that really kind of put me off.
What is your,

735
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,480
how,
how so?

736
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,520
Well,
she basically told me that we were going

737
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:27,720
to have the war,
you know,

738
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:32,370
not so many words that,
but just there was a coldness to her and

739
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,360
a distaste for me that was sort of 
radiating from her.

740
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,453
So she had to.
She was animous possessed from a union 

741
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:40,344
perspective.
That's the right way of thinking about 

742
00:36:41,411 --> 00:36:42,244
it.
One of the ways of thinking about that 

743
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:45,150
is that she had a chip on her shoulder 
and relationship to me,

744
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:50,390
so she'd already formulated who I was in
her imagination and she was also maybe a

745
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:51,924
form of projection,
so like I was the embodiment of all the 

746
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:57,330
things that she found distasteful and 
that's who she was.

747
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,373
So there was no,
there was no willingness to consider on 

748
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:07,671
her part that I could be different than 
her preconceptions of.

749
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,320
Right.
And so she was,

750
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,783
she was hostile to me in the way that 
you would be if you were prejudiced 

751
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:17,040
against someone right from the 
beginning.

752
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,113
And so by the time it was uncomfortable 
in the room and by the time and there 

753
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:23,604
was a photo shoot.
And so by the time the conversation 

754
00:37:25,081 --> 00:37:25,914
started,
I was more impatient than I would 

755
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:28,494
normally be because one of the things 
that I do expect from journalists and 

756
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:33,060
Kathy Newman was like this,
by the way.

757
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:35,880
And so have some of the other people 
that go on and have gone after me.

758
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:41,270
At least they had the professionalism to
be civil before the interview started.

759
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,470
You know,
like because there's a certain amount of

760
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:49,680
politeness,
I would say that not that I'm owed,

761
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:52,080
but that someone you're interviewing is 
owed.

762
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,170
If they come out of their way to go talk
to you.

763
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:58,860
It's just human decency.
There's no real conflict.

764
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,900
Right.
Until you have this conflict,

765
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,950
it's just.
Hello,

766
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,993
nice to meet you guys.
Thank you for coming to human beings 

767
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:06,390
interacting with each other.
Yes.

768
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,100
Yes.
On,

769
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,890
on,
on,

770
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,480
on.
Relatively professional.

771
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,950
Well,
even just professional,

772
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,870
just professional grounds.
It's like,

773
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,140
well we're both here to do a job and 
I've agreed to come but,

774
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,101
but no,
the,

775
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:19,830
the,
there was palpable enmity in the air.

776
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:20,664
Right to begin with.
And you know what I actually thought at 

777
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:25,090
the end of that interview,
I thought Jews,

778
00:38:25,091 --> 00:38:25,924
you know,
maybe I'm,

779
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,023
maybe I've done enough interviews 
because I found that I was more 

780
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:31,890
impatient than I would've liked to have 
been.

781
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:32,724
Now,
luckily it doesn't seem to have gone 

782
00:38:34,141 --> 00:38:34,974
overboard because I'd watching the 
comments on that Gq interview and I 

783
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:40,690
think it's got about four and a half 
million views,

784
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:41,524
some ridiculous number of views and 
people have said that I was more 

785
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:47,920
impatient and a little harsher than 
usual,

786
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:48,940
which I think is true.

787
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,470
And I thought,
God,

788
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:51,304
you know,
maybe I'm starting to run out of 

789
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,620
patience,
which isn't good.

790
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:54,454
Right?
And I don't want to run out of patience 

791
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:56,883
because then it,
it will flavor the message that you're 

792
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:01,400
putting out.
Definitely.

793
00:39:01,401 --> 00:39:02,234
And people will take it in the wrong way
and they'll take it in with that 

794
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:05,920
bitterness.
Exactly.

795
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,783
When.
One of the things that I think is very 

796
00:39:08,441 --> 00:39:13,050
important is that you don't become 
resentful and well and,

797
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,850
and you know,
when I'm on this tour for example,

798
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,090
like there's no resentment for me 
because you think,

799
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:20,380
well this is.
You might think,

800
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:23,720
well this is a lot of work and I've been
running around like mad and,

801
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,933
and you know,
it takes a lot of organization and it's 

802
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:27,724
quite demanding and all of that.
And that's all true and that none of 

803
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:30,874
that is a complaint.
And I decided with Tammy right at the 

804
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:34,810
beginning that,
well,

805
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:36,310
first of all that this was going to be 
work,

806
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,410
not a vacation because we're not stupid.

807
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,420
We know you can't have everything at the
same time.

808
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:43,150
If you have any sense,
you're lucky if you get some things that

809
00:39:43,151 --> 00:39:44,230
are good at once,
you know.

810
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,243
So we're very grateful to have that 
opportunity and that I was going to 

811
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:52,600
continue to do this as long as I was 
thrilled to be in front of the audience.

812
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:53,434
And then when I meet people afterwards 
that I'm not looking at the end of the 

813
00:39:55,991 --> 00:39:57,610
line to see when the night ends,
you know,

814
00:39:57,611 --> 00:40:01,510
because I want to be sure that every 
single person that comes to meet me,

815
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,010
I'm,
you know,

816
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,410
president president for absolutely 
because I am,

817
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,440
I am actually quite taken aback and 
thrilled,

818
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,930
I guess is the right word.
Grateful grads.

819
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:16,270
Better apps that they're there.
It's like God,

820
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,440
man,
some of these people,

821
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:20,080
you know,
like I was in there coming from all over

822
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:21,250
the place,
you know,

823
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:23,560
people fly in from Australia into 
Europe,

824
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,970
they've flown,
they've flown,

825
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,150
it's lots of eastern Europeans came to 
England.

826
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,313
In fact,
they're making huge tracks or it's guys 

827
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:32,190
who came from like eight.
They took,

828
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,063
took him like 12 hours to get through 
Russia to come to Finland to watch the 

829
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:37,760
talk there,
you know,

830
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:38,230
and,
and,

831
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,150
and then not just a few people like 
that.

832
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:42,580
People are really going way the hell out
of their way,

833
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,860
you know,
and then,

834
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,693
and then they line up and it's not that 
it's not inexpensive because these 

835
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:49,810
venues are expensive and,
and all of that.

836
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,980
And I'm,
well I'm,

837
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:56,900
I'm due and it's the same with the damn 
interviews.

838
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:57,734
It's like I'm doing my best to not take 
any of this for granted and not get 

839
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:03,530
annoyed about it.
And,

840
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,830
and that goes for the conflict to.
It's like,

841
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,010
well,
you know,

842
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:14,230
I've tried to have my agent screen out.
Maybe the more egregious um,

843
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,020
interviews,
you know,

844
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,853
the ones that would just be nothing but 
combat because there I find them quite 

845
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:23,380
stressful though I wouldn't say I'm 
hiding from them,

846
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,483
but you don't know to begin with how an 
interview is going to go and I could 

847
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:28,474
just say,
well I'm done having interviews for 

848
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,010
awhile but I,
I can't

849
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,843
help but see that the conflict is a 
necessary part of this even though I 

850
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:38,654
don't find it pleasant.
Like people think they accused me of 

851
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:42,880
being a provocateur,
of enjoying the conflict.

852
00:41:42,881 --> 00:41:45,410
And it's actually not true at all.
I don't enjoy it at all.

853
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,393
It usually takes me about three days to 
recover from a particularly contentious 

854
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:50,894
interview,
you know,

855
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,730
because I find it,
I find conflict,

856
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:54,500
interpersonal conflict.
Quite stressful,

857
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,230
you know?
But I think everyone does.

858
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,730
Yes.
And to pretend you don't,

859
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,160
you're either a sociopath or you're a 
liar.

860
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:01,940
Yes,
yes.

861
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,240
Well there are people who seem to enjoy 
that kind of intellectual combat.

862
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,074
You know,
that the political types are more like 

863
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:08,744
that.
But,

864
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,673
but I think they still afterwards feel 
it and if they read the comments and 

865
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,400
people are against them,
it's just that unease it carries.

866
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,510
Well,
you would think so.

867
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,403
I mean I don't even know how people deal
with it because I mean I'm been 

868
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:23,200
fortunate because although,
you know,

869
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,880
I've had a fair bit of negative press 
coverage,

870
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,960
the comments in on Youtube in 
particular,

871
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:34,520
which is where the bulk of them are and,
and I would say among the general public

872
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,593
have been overwhelmingly positive.
I don't know what the hell it would be 

873
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:39,590
like to be in a world where that was 
reversed,

874
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,200
where,
you know,

875
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,530
the majority of people are against you.
I've seen this,

876
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:47,450
I've seen it happen with guests that 
I've had on the show where I've met them

877
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,230
afterwards and you see a physical effect
on them.

878
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,450
You see them beaten down like Jesus 
Christ.

879
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:54,620
Those comments are so me.
And I'm like,

880
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:56,630
you can't read those.
You can't read those.

881
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,870
And you see how it's affecting them.
Like they can't sleep.

882
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:00,400
They real.

883
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,490
Yeah.
It fucks with them.

884
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:03,290
They'll stay up for nights.
You know,

885
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,340
it's not good.
It's,

886
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,420
it's you're,
you're,

887
00:43:05,421 --> 00:43:06,254
you're taking in all of these opinions 
of hundreds if not thousands of people 

888
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:13,880
that you don't even know if they're 
coming from a healthy place and and most

889
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:16,820
of those opinions,
they would not express it that way.

890
00:43:16,821 --> 00:43:19,510
If they were talking,
they could get the same message across.

891
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,670
I think you were ignorant to these 
facts.

892
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:23,504
I think your bias and your perceptions,
even if they had an opinion that was 

893
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,960
unflattering,
the way they express it to you,

894
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:30,794
they'd be considerate about you and your
feelings as a human being and if they 

895
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,144
weren't,
you wouldn't take into consideration 

896
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:38,060
what they're saying because this guy's 
just an asshole,

897
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,390
but when you just see it in type,
we just see print.

898
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,740
It just doesn't.
It just,

899
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:43,450
it,
it.

900
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,370
It could be a smart person,
it could be a psycho,

901
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:47,330
it could be a fool.

902
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,050
It could be anything,
but it's also funny too because the,

903
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,970
the negative comments that are part of 
social media seemed to be just as potent

904
00:43:55,971 --> 00:43:56,804
as negative comments in real life,
but the positive comments don't seem to 

905
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:03,080
be as positive as the positive comments 
in real life.

906
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,313
Like,
and I don't,

907
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,173
they,
they don't seem as real and I guess 

908
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:10,370
that's partly because we're wired to be 
more sensitive to threat and to negative

909
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:11,600
emotion because,
well,

910
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:13,010
because we're,
we can be hurt.

911
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,230
Well,
it's also healthy to,

912
00:44:14,231 --> 00:44:15,064
to not stroke your ego too much if 
you're just like concentrating only on 

913
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:18,663
like if there's something distasteful if
you go to someone's page and they just 

914
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:21,704
retweet all the positive things that 
people say to them because then it has 

915
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:24,894
this sort of reinforcing cycle where 
people know that if I say something 

916
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:29,690
really positive with Jordan,
he's going to retweet me.

917
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,220
Like there are some people they engage

918
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,990
in this sort of commerce,
you know,

919
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:37,880
like you say something positive,
they retweet you and you know,

920
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:38,910
it's,
it's a little,

921
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,553
it's a little too strokey.
People get really into that stroke in 

922
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:43,470
there.

923
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:43,951
Yeah.
Yeah.

924
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:44,880
Well I guess,
yeah.

925
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:47,700
I guess the danger of that is that 
possibility of,

926
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:52,110
of that ego inflation that you really 
want to avoid because that's a bad idea,

927
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:53,630
bad idea.

928
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,463
You've done a wonderful job of avoiding 
those waters because this is a new this 

929
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,053
for a guy who's in his fifties who 
becomes famous out of nowhere and 

930
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,170
doesn't just become fame,
just just become famous,

931
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:11,171
but becomes this culturally significant 
sort of lightening Rod.

932
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,420
I mean,
that's how I view you and a lot of these

933
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:15,680
talks that you're dealing.
A lot of these,

934
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,970
these debates like you're having with 
this woman at Gq or some of your,

935
00:45:18,971 --> 00:45:19,804
your interviews.
What you're doing is you're expressing 

936
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:23,384
yourself in a brave but very 
controversial way and a lot of people 

937
00:45:27,531 --> 00:45:28,364
are paying attention to this,
but then you're backing it up with your 

938
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:33,020
research or backing it up with real 
science.

939
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:37,600
You're backing up with a tremendous 
amount of history of,

940
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,000
of,
of the human race and religion and,

941
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:41,843
uh,
the scientific studies that have been 

942
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,384
done that show correlations between 
different types of behaviors and human 

943
00:45:47,151 --> 00:45:49,400
beings.
And all this is rich.

944
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,390
It's,
it's very.

945
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:52,850
It's very rewarding if you could take it
all in.

946
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:53,953
But when it goes against what people 
have the preconceived notions or their 

947
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:00,890
own set of beliefs that they're bringing
to your conversations,

948
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:04,510
into your debates,
then it creates this hostile,

949
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,430
a battle where what you're saying is,
is,

950
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,380
is very contrary to the way they've been
living their life or the

951
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,670
really saw that in Scandinavia,
Scandinavia.

952
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,170
Well,
I was there.

953
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:23,590
I went to Stockholm twice in Oslo,
twice in Helsinki twice in Copenhagen,

954
00:46:24,411 --> 00:46:25,244
once in the last month and I spent quite
a bit of a lot of interviews and a lot 

955
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,890
of discussion about the so called gender
paradox.

956
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,800
Now it's a very interesting thing 
because it's really put their tails into

957
00:46:36,801 --> 00:46:37,634
not in Scandinavia and that makes sense 
because the scandinavians are going to 

958
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,984
have to deal with this first because 
they've gone the farthest down the road 

959
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:50,360
for like making their society gender 
equal.

960
00:46:50,361 --> 00:46:52,340
But explain that to me.
I will,

961
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:52,881
I will.
Okay.

962
00:46:52,881 --> 00:46:55,700
So,
so imagine first of all that there's two

963
00:46:55,701 --> 00:47:00,701
kinds of equality that you might pursue.
One would be equality of opportunity and

964
00:47:00,981 --> 00:47:05,981
so that would mean that there's wide 
range of talent across people regardless

965
00:47:06,951 --> 00:47:09,320
of their type,
whatever that might be.

966
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,300
Sex,
gender,

967
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:12,800
race,
ethnicity.

968
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:13,813
There's,
there's talent distributed everywhere 

969
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:16,603
and it's kind of a truism and I would 
say a truism of the West in the deepest 

970
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:22,124
sense that each of the individuals 
within those groups should be put in a 

971
00:47:24,981 --> 00:47:28,280
position where they,
their talents are.

972
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,233
They're encouraged manifest those 
talents partly because that would be 

973
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:33,220
good for them spiritually and 
psychologically,

974
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:35,950
but also because that would be a benefit
to the community,

975
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,570
right?
I mean talent's rare,

976
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,583
which people don't understand.
There's lots of different kinds of 

977
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:41,650
talent,
but it's.

978
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,573
But in each domain it's rare and so it's
to everyone's benefit to exploit 

979
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,150
talented people to the maximum possible 
degree.

980
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:49,984
So even if you're just selfish,
you want to push for equality of 

981
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:56,530
opportunity because the more talented 
people there are out there,

982
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:57,364
the more cool stuff you get to have and 
hopefully the more diverse and 

983
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:02,260
interesting your life is so.

984
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:03,483
So you can pursue equality of 
opportunity policies and the 

985
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:10,930
Scandinavians have done that.
Especially trying to knock down barriers

986
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,920
for women in the workplace and by all 
accounts,

987
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,653
by all standard theories,
the Scandinavian countries in places 

988
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,920
like the Netherlands,
Canada to a slightly lesser degree,

989
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,420
um,
have done,

990
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:26,254
uh,
have gone farther than any other 

991
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:32,971
countries in pursuing those policies.
Okay.

992
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,511
And,
and,

993
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:38,680
and part of the consequence of that is 
that some of the differences between men

994
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:39,514
and women have been minimized.
So obviously there's far more women in 

995
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:44,164
the workplace and there were 40 years 
ago and in many occupations there's 

996
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:49,840
actually dominance by women.
There's dominance in the universities,

997
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:53,020
there's dominance in the healthcare 
fields and so women have poured into the

998
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:53,854
workplace and hypothetically there's 
problems with that because it's put a 

999
00:48:57,491 --> 00:49:02,491
lot of stress on family structure.
But hypothetically that's for the best.

1000
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,363
And because it gives people a broader 
range of choices and it gives everyone 

1001
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:07,540
access to more talent.
So.

1002
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,430
And then also if you look around the 
world,

1003
00:49:09,431 --> 00:49:11,200
you see that one of the best predictors 
of,

1004
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:12,143
of the probability of economic 
development in developing countries is 

1005
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:15,784
their attitude is the attitude in those 
countries towards equal rights for 

1006
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:20,290
women.
And it looks causal,

1007
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:25,150
the more positively the country is 
predisposed to female rights,

1008
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:27,040
the more likely they are to develop 
economically.

1009
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:28,263
And maybe that's because that indicates 
that they're open to new ideas or 

1010
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:32,080
something like that are open to 
transformation.

1011
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,870
So okay,
so that's one kind of equality,

1012
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:35,943
open up the playing field so that 
everybody has a chance to compete and 

1013
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:40,390
cooperate and land and land where they 
will.

1014
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,120
But then the other kind of equality is 
equality of outcome.

1015
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:47,050
So and that's often described as equity 
in today's language.

1016
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:52,050
And so the ultimate equity Utopia would 
be take every job,

1017
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,313
every conceivable kind of job,
and then stratify that by every 

1018
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:57,514
conceivable level of authority within 
every job and then ensure that every 

1019
00:50:03,611 --> 00:50:07,660
single category of person is represented
in precise,

1020
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:12,670
a proportion to their,
to their prevalence in the population.

1021
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:13,893
So every job should be 50 percent women 
and 50 percent man and say 13 percent 

1022
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,070
non western ethnic minority and whatever
that happens to be.

1023
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:24,160
And then you could break that down and 
so and otherwise,

1024
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:27,290
there's evidence of systemic prejudice.
Okay?

1025
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:31,190
Now first thing to say about that is 
that's impossible.

1026
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,323
And the reason it's impossible is 
because there is no limit to the number 

1027
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:39,080
of ways that you can categorize people 
into groups so you know,

1028
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:39,914
you,
you know about sex and ethnicity and 

1029
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:42,650
race,
maybe those are the obvious ones,

1030
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:46,100
but now you have gender and then you 
have ethnicity and you know,

1031
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,013
and then there's attractiveness and 
intelligence and temperament and height 

1032
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,180
and age and socioeconomic background.

1033
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,070
And I mean,
let's say there's 20,

1034
00:50:55,071 --> 00:50:55,904
but there's a lot more than that.
There's no possible way that you could 

1035
00:50:58,971 --> 00:50:59,804
ever regulated society so tightly that 
every single one of those groups was 

1036
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:07,754
equally represented in every single one 
of those occupations at every single 

1037
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:11,924
level of the hierarchy.
That is what they want to concentrate 

1038
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:14,510
on.
The significant ones.

1039
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,160
Men and women and race.
Oh yeah.

1040
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:18,320
But who's to say those are the 
significant ones?

1041
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,840
That's the other thing.
It isn't even obvious that they are.

1042
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:21,674
Because I would say that like a more 
significant one is cognitive ability 

1043
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,760
because that's a way bigger predictor of
longterm life success than sex or race.

1044
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:29,923
So I don't even think that we've 
necessarily identified the canonical 

1045
00:51:32,961 --> 00:51:33,794
groups.
We've just decided that gender and race 

1046
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:37,190
are the,
maybe they're the most obvious,

1047
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,380
but isn't there a problem is that people
don't.

1048
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,640
What they don't do is they don't take 
in,

1049
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,530
in terms of cognitive ability,
they don't get on a team.

1050
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:49,750
They don't get on like there's people 
that are sexist yet,

1051
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,593
but there's.
It's very rare that someone is elitist 

1052
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:55,700
in terms of their cognitive ability.
Well,

1053
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,593
hard to say Joe.
I mean I think one of the reasons that 

1054
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,640
elitist prejudice is a better word.
I don't know.

1055
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,590
You could be right,
but look,

1056
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:05,710
I think one of the reasons that like if 
you.

1057
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:07,290
Here's something that's kind of 
confusing.

1058
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,710
It makes sense now that I'm thinking 
about.

1059
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:09,950
Of course they are.
Well,

1060
00:52:09,951 --> 00:52:10,784
there's one thing that's quite peculiar 
about the United States in that regard 

1061
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:16,820
is like most working class people,
let's say,

1062
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,253
are far more irritated with the 
intellectual elite than they are with 

1063
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:26,210
the wealthy elite and that's because 
they think they could become wealthy and

1064
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:27,044
they could,
but they don't think they could become 

1065
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:29,930
part of the intellectual elite.

1066
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:32,780
And it isn't obvious to me that the 
intellectual elite.

1067
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,673
So those would be the liberal left 
leaning types that dominate the media 

1068
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:38,930
and academia are particularly,
um,

1069
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,153
positive in their,
in their attitudes towards the typical 

1070
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:47,960
working class person.
I think they're prejudiced and elitist.

1071
00:52:47,961 --> 00:52:50,530
I do believe that that's the case and I 
think they're also,

1072
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,310
um,
what would you call it?

1073
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:53,144
Patronizing.
And I think that the typical working 

1074
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:57,920
class person say who voted for trump is 
very,

1075
00:52:57,921 --> 00:52:58,754
very sensitive to that.
And so they're much more concerned with 

1076
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:01,814
the one percent who are the cognitive 
leap than they are the one percent who 

1077
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:04,964
are the economic elite because at least 
they think that's a game they could 

1078
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:09,890
play.
So anyways,

1079
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,733
it was also because it was caricature is
right of the one percent of the 

1080
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:15,643
economically you just think of people 
that are in these lofty positions that 

1081
00:53:18,531 --> 00:53:20,330
are in control of the financial 
institutions,

1082
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:21,164
but the one percent of the 
intellectually you think of in terms of 

1083
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:27,720
like some of the more preposterous you 
hearing out of universities now and save

1084
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:30,000
spaces and oh yeah,
there's that too.

1085
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,740
There's two things that there's no,
well,

1086
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:33,683
there's no appreciation on the part of 
the intellectual elite for the 

1087
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:38,940
pathologies of rational of rationalism.
Right?

1088
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:39,830
I mean,
there's no,

1089
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:43,080
there's nothing stupider than a smart 
person who went wrong.

1090
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:44,760
You know,
like you,

1091
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,900
you can tank on.
I've,

1092
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:47,660
I've seen this in my clients,
you know,

1093
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,533
frequently,
like if I have a particularly smart 

1094
00:53:51,091 --> 00:53:54,020
client who's particularly disordered in 
their personality,

1095
00:53:54,021 --> 00:53:55,890
that that's just,
that's often just,

1096
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,620
that's so difficult.
It's almost unimaginable because there's

1097
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:00,360
so little,
for example,

1098
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:01,194
that one.
Yeah,

1099
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:01,950
yeah,
yeah.

1100
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,320
What is your approach to handling 
something like that?

1101
00:54:04,321 --> 00:54:05,154
Who's like super intelligent,
but yet completely their life is in 

1102
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,300
disarray?
Well,

1103
00:54:09,301 --> 00:54:10,830
you know,
I'm usually,

1104
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,930
I usually take a very practical 
approach,

1105
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:13,680
like,
you know,

1106
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,513
we try to identify,
because I start always in my therapy 

1107
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:18,960
practice,
always start with behavioral principles.

1108
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:19,501
It's like,
okay,

1109
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:22,110
well let's see if we can identify a few 
areas,

1110
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,373
you know,
through negotiation that are really 

1111
00:54:24,691 --> 00:54:26,790
causing you grief and misery,
you know,

1112
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:27,360
like,
what's,

1113
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,460
what's wrong with your life as far as 
you're concerned.

1114
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:30,623
And so that often takes a lot of 
discussion and then we might try to 

1115
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:33,384
figure out what's causing that.
And that's often very difficult to 

1116
00:54:36,211 --> 00:54:39,390
figure out too because it might be Jesus
might be something physical,

1117
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,753
you know,
you might be sick in some way because 

1118
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:46,170
depression has lots of depression,
is autoimmune related and anxiety can be

1119
00:54:46,171 --> 00:54:47,004
a side effect of all sorts of 
physiological disorders are eating 

1120
00:54:49,321 --> 00:54:52,620
improperly or sleeping badly or,
or not exercising,

1121
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,473
you know,
enough to kind of keep yourself 

1122
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:56,400
regulated.
She tried to figure out what,

1123
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,533
what's causing it.
And then you try to sketch out some 

1124
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:01,410
possible solution that we could both 
test.

1125
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:04,320
And then with the,
with the,

1126
00:55:04,321 --> 00:55:06,420
uh,
with the more intelligent ones,

1127
00:55:06,421 --> 00:55:08,430
you know,
often they can come up with all sorts of

1128
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:11,130
reasons why none of this is going to 
work or,

1129
00:55:11,131 --> 00:55:13,200
or a thousand reasons why.
Yeah.

1130
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,810
Well usually a thousand reasons why none
of this is going to work.

1131
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:16,973
And that with people like that,
sometimes it's useful to turn to their 

1132
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:19,884
dreams if they dream.
Because one of the things that's cool 

1133
00:55:22,261 --> 00:55:24,510
about dreams is that even though they're
hard to interpret,

1134
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:25,403
they never lie.
And so sometimes you can take someone 

1135
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:31,200
who's hyper rational and they'll have a 
dream and they'll tell you the dream and

1136
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:32,034
then you can work through an 
interpretation which is a tricky 

1137
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:34,554
business.
And the dream will tell them something 

1138
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:38,070
and there's just no denying it.
It's like,

1139
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:40,290
well,
it's a statement from nature.

1140
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:41,183
So what are you going to do?
You gonna pretend that that's not the 

1141
00:55:42,661 --> 00:55:44,100
case,
you know,

1142
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:45,270
so,
so that's,

1143
00:55:45,271 --> 00:55:47,970
that's often extremely useful.
So,

1144
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,260
so,
okay,

1145
00:55:49,261 --> 00:55:49,650
so,
well,

1146
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,240
back to the equality issue.
So,

1147
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:52,650
okay,
so here's what's happened.

1148
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,900
So psychologists have,
and this is what's putting a tale,

1149
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:58,560
not in the tail of the Scandinavians.

1150
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,633
Psychologists have come to a pretty 
decent agreement about standard 

1151
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:03,360
personality models,
right?

1152
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:05,070
So there's extroversion,
neuroticism,

1153
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:07,530
agreeableness,
openness and conscientiousness.

1154
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,110
And they look fairly stable 
cross-culturally.

1155
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,800
And that was all done by asking 
thousands of people,

1156
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:17,100
hundreds and hundreds of questions and 
then grouping them statistically.

1157
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,293
So it was a theoretical.
Basically compute took computational 

1158
00:56:21,841 --> 00:56:26,470
power and statistics to find out that 
these are how traits group,

1159
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:27,783
so I'm an extroverted,
people are sociable and happy and 

1160
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:34,070
neurotic people experience a fair bit of
negative emotion,

1161
00:56:34,071 --> 00:56:35,650
so that's the positive and negative 
emotion.

1162
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:36,484
Dimensions.
Agreeable people are maternal and 

1163
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:39,154
disagreeable people are competitive and 
there's a fair bit of male female 

1164
00:56:41,681 --> 00:56:43,540
difference.
They're conscientious.

1165
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:47,440
People are dutiful and industrious and 
orderly and the open people are creative

1166
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,360
and so those are your basic five 
dimensions.

1167
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,373
Okay?
So that's been established and everyone 

1168
00:56:51,431 --> 00:56:54,730
more or less agrees on it.
Now maybe there are seven dimensions and

1169
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,920
we've got a questionnaire that that 
breaks the five down into 10.

1170
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:03,910
That's called understand myself,
but,

1171
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:08,050
but basically there's good,
there's good consensus consent,

1172
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,180
consensus on the five.
Okay,

1173
00:57:10,181 --> 00:57:12,400
so now soon as you have the five basic 
traits,

1174
00:57:12,401 --> 00:57:13,930
you can ask some questions like,
well,

1175
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:14,764
do men and women differ?
And so what you do is you just give the 

1176
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:18,663
questionnaire.
You can either fill it out yourself or 

1177
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:22,240
have other people fill it out on your 
behalf.

1178
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,920
So,
and it could be a teacher,

1179
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,000
could be a parent,
you know,

1180
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:28,720
and that's all been done and what you 
find is there are systematic differences

1181
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:29,554
between men and women and the biggest 
differences are that women experience 

1182
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:36,430
more negative emotion and that and that 
they're more agreeable than men,

1183
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:37,953
so and that's borne out by the 
psychiatric evidence because I'm higher 

1184
00:57:42,401 --> 00:57:46,570
levels of negative emotion are 
manifested in depression and anxiety and

1185
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:50,530
women are diagnosed with higher levels 
of depression and anxiety all around the

1186
00:57:50,531 --> 00:57:53,020
world and with agreeableness.

1187
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:53,853
That's also borne out by the clinical 
literature in some sense the medical 

1188
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:57,724
literature,
sociomedical literature because 

1189
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:00,483
disagreeable people are more likely to 
be incarcerated because it's the best 

1190
00:58:03,341 --> 00:58:04,174
predictor of being incarcerated even 
though it's not a very good predictor 

1191
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,053
and men are incarcerated at about a 10 
to one rate compared to women and are 

1192
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:11,740
more likely to be antisocial and conduct
disordered.

1193
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:16,810
So the personality differences are 
mirrored in the sociomedical literature.

1194
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:17,560
Okay.
So,

1195
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,000
so now,
so there are differences,

1196
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:19,834
but then there's a question.
Are those differences a consequence of 

1197
00:58:22,241 --> 00:58:26,680
socialization or the biological?
And the answer to that is tricky because

1198
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,533
how much something is social and how 
much it is biological actually depends 

1199
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:35,440
on the social circumstances.
So while here's an example,

1200
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,600
if you have a society where no one has 
enough to eat and people are starving,

1201
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,460
then there's a huge cultural effect on 
people's intelligence.

1202
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:48,310
Let's say that's mediated by economic 
factors,

1203
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,100
even though it's got a biological 
origin,

1204
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,390
right?
This starvation.

1205
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,373
So the relationship between biology and 
cultures actually partly culturally 

1206
00:58:57,161 --> 00:58:58,660
dependent.
So it makes it complicated.

1207
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,673
But in any case,
here's how the scientists decided to 

1208
00:59:02,531 --> 00:59:04,300
address this.
They thought,

1209
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:09,580
well,
why don't we rank order countries by how

1210
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,473
egalitarian they're social policies are,
which you can do with a fair degree of 

1211
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:16,720
reliability.
You know,

1212
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:20,710
you've put the countries where women are
second class citizens at the bottom,

1213
00:59:20,711 --> 00:59:22,850
and you'd put the Scandinavian countries
at the top.

1214
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,713
You can get good reliability across 
raters for how you would rate those 

1215
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:26,984
countries.
And then look at the magnitude of the 

1216
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:32,780
differences between men and women,
by the egalitarian social policies.

1217
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,780
And so then you'll find out,
and here's the hypothesis,

1218
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:39,440
if the differences between men and women
are primary,

1219
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:40,483
primarily social,
then as cultures become more 

1220
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:45,380
egalitarian,
men and women will become more alike.

1221
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,220
That's not what happened.
The opposite happened.

1222
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:54,260
The more egalitarian society and it 
turns out the Richard This society,

1223
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:58,340
because that's also been discovered now 
the more different men and women become.

1224
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:02,840
And so the differences are not huge.
So with agreeableness,

1225
01:00:02,841 --> 01:00:06,560
for example,
if you took the average man,

1226
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,453
if took a typical man and a typical 
woman out of the population just 

1227
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:13,550
randomly and you had to bet that the 
woman was more aggressive than the man,

1228
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:18,790
you'd be wrong 60 percent of the time.
So there's quite a bit of overlap,

1229
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,250
right?
Because you'd be right 40 percent of the

1230
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,084
time.
But the problem is is that a lot of 

1231
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:26,384
selection takes place at the extremes.
Maybe you're only concerned about 

1232
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:30,523
disagreeable people when they become 
violent and maybe it's only the one in 

1233
01:00:33,471 --> 01:00:37,520
50 most disagreeable person who's 
violent and they're all men.

1234
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:41,990
So you can have quite a bit of 
similarity at,

1235
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:42,973
at the average level and big differences
at the extremes and the extremes is 

1236
01:00:46,341 --> 01:00:49,610
where people do things like,
like employment selection.

1237
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,060
So the biggest difference that's been 
discovered between men and women,

1238
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:56,210
and this is the one that gets biggest in
the Scandinavian countries,

1239
01:00:56,211 --> 01:00:57,044
is the interest.
Men are more interested in things and 

1240
01:01:00,261 --> 01:01:03,170
women are more interested in people and 
it's a big difference.

1241
01:01:03,171 --> 01:01:07,560
It's one full standard deviation.
And so what that means is that if you're

1242
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,413
a man,
you would have to be more interested in 

1243
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:12,134
people than 85 percent of men to be as 
interested in people as the 50th 

1244
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:17,744
percentile a woman,
and you'd have to be more interested in 

1245
01:01:20,601 --> 01:01:24,890
things than 85 percent of women to be as
interested in things as the typical man.

1246
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,900
And what do you,
how do you define things?

1247
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,480
Ob Gadgets,
gadgets,

1248
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:32,780
things,
non non non animate things.

1249
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,020
Cars,
yeah.

1250
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,210
Yeah.
Tools,

1251
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:36,950
you know,
technology,

1252
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:39,320
right?
Stem fields.

1253
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:43,070
Because the other thing that's happened 
is that the more egalitarian the society

1254
01:01:43,071 --> 01:01:45,470
that fewer women go into the stem 
fields,

1255
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,050
the fewer that's interested.
Yeah.

1256
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,063
Okay.
So,

1257
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,053
so now this unraveled in a big way,
it's like this is a hugely a relevant 

1258
01:01:56,121 --> 01:01:56,954
issue politically because it means that 
you cannot have equality of opportunity 

1259
01:02:01,491 --> 01:02:03,200
and equality of outcome at the same 
time.

1260
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,063
It's not possible because as you make 
your society more egalitarian and you 

1261
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:11,060
open up the opportunity for equality of 
outcome,

1262
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,673
you increase how different men and women
are are and that changes their 

1263
01:02:16,821 --> 01:02:20,280
occupational choice.
So if men are more interested

1264
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,180
in things which they are by a 
substantial margin than way more of them

1265
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:29,181
are going to be engineers,
wouldn't that possibly support this idea

1266
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:34,090
that in enforced model of,
of,

1267
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:38,250
of equality would allow people to be 
themselves more?

1268
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,110
I mean this is almost what you're 
saying.

1269
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:43,680
Well that is the optimistic viewpoint.
Like,

1270
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,053
well look,
it's so funny because the Swedish 

1271
01:02:46,081 --> 01:02:50,190
foreign minister told me to go crawl 
back under the rock that I came out from

1272
01:02:50,191 --> 01:02:54,300
under when I was in Scandinavia because 
I was describing this,

1273
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,820
these,
this science.

1274
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:59,160
I've read that,
but I'm not exactly sure why.

1275
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,033
Well,
she regards me as misogynists because I 

1276
01:03:01,381 --> 01:03:02,214
think that there are.
Because I think because I've been 

1277
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:04,763
putting forward the evidence that there 
are genuine differences between men and 

1278
01:03:07,381 --> 01:03:08,214
women,
but she should be held accountable for 

1279
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:12,230
that because that's just a flippant 
thing to say like you,

1280
01:03:12,231 --> 01:03:12,490
you,
you,

1281
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:13,323
you should have,
especially in a position of power like 

1282
01:03:15,121 --> 01:03:18,000
she's in,
you should have a very specific argument

1283
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:23,210
saying like for a leader to have such a 
base thing to say such a crude,

1284
01:03:24,511 --> 01:03:25,344
dumb thing to say,
crawl back under the rock that you came 

1285
01:03:27,451 --> 01:03:27,570
from.

1286
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:28,403
Well,
I thought she was making a joke about 

1287
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:30,780
lobsters,
but I don't think she was.

1288
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:33,510
The lobsters go onto rocks.
I guess they do the ground cracks.

1289
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,430
Yeah.
The bigger lobsters have better rock.

1290
01:03:35,431 --> 01:03:36,264
That was another very interesting thing 
in the Gq thing where the woman was 

1291
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:42,580
challenging you on your neurobiology,
your neurochemistry and that.

1292
01:03:42,581 --> 01:03:42,931
Yes.
Well,

1293
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:44,130
hardly,
hardly any.

1294
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:44,993
Hardly any psychologists understand that
serotonin is associated with 

1295
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:51,090
hierarchies.
It's like a truism.

1296
01:03:51,091 --> 01:03:53,730
It's been known for 30 years,
so we can definitely get back to that.

1297
01:03:53,731 --> 01:03:56,760
But I,
I'm very curious about this because this

1298
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:59,730
idea of enforced equality,
right?

1299
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,593
Ensuring that there is such a high 
emphasis played a place on equality 

1300
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,820
equality,
that you have the equal amount of men,

1301
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:08,673
the equal amount of women and the 
opportunities are absolutely available 

1302
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,530
as much to women as they are to end.
This is enforced.

1303
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:18,180
This creates an environment where 
there's less resistance.

1304
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:21,240
Now in an environment where there's less
resistance,

1305
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:24,210
perhaps women don't feel as compelled to
say,

1306
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:27,370
I'll show you that.
That is what seems to happen.

1307
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:29,040
Well,
here's a look.

1308
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:29,874
Here's an example.
So there are fewer women mathematicians 

1309
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,130
in the higher echelons.
Okay,

1310
01:04:35,131 --> 01:04:38,910
but here's something interesting about 
mathematical ability.

1311
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,050
First of all,
it's very rare,

1312
01:04:40,051 --> 01:04:41,640
so that's the first thing to keep in 
mind.

1313
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:47,100
Now it looks like if you look in junior 
high that give mathematically gifted men

1314
01:04:47,101 --> 01:04:50,430
and males and females are approximately 
as common.

1315
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,880
Now there's a little bit of debate about
that because there is some evidence that

1316
01:04:53,881 --> 01:04:54,714
maybe at the very upper extremes there's
a male advantage just like there's a 

1317
01:04:57,601 --> 01:04:58,434
male disadvantage at the low end because
the mail distribution for intelligence 

1318
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:02,484
might be flatter,
and so that's the greater married male 

1319
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:08,520
variability hypothesis.
There's been papers putting that forward

1320
01:05:08,521 --> 01:05:09,354
that had been retracted as a consequence
of pressure from politically correct 

1321
01:05:11,911 --> 01:05:12,744
people,
even though greater male variability is 

1322
01:05:15,061 --> 01:05:18,190
actually quite common in the animal 
kingdom for a variety of reasons.

1323
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,083
Men are more expendable,
that males are more expendable in some 

1324
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:21,994
ways,
or you could say that males are more 

1325
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:27,340
likely to purdue to pursue high risk,
high return strategies.

1326
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,440
You can look at it either way and it's 
certainly possible.

1327
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:31,960
In any case,
the men,

1328
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:35,110
the males in junior high who happened to
be mathematically gifted,

1329
01:05:35,111 --> 01:05:38,260
are less likely to also be verbally 
gifted.

1330
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,620
Whereas that doesn't seem to be the case
for the females,

1331
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:42,693
and so if you're a male math nerd,
then math is pretty logical pathway for 

1332
01:05:47,801 --> 01:05:50,320
you because you don't have as many other
options.

1333
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:51,154
Whereas if you're a female math nerd,
you have other options because you're 

1334
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,083
less likely,
you're more likely to also be verbally 

1335
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:58,234
gifted and so that's enough to at least 
in principle account for some of the 

1336
01:06:01,241 --> 01:06:04,240
reasons why there are fewer women 
mathematicians than men.

1337
01:06:04,241 --> 01:06:06,160
Mathematicians.
They have other options.

1338
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:08,890
They have other options and there's lots
of complex.

1339
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,053
There's lots of complex reasons like 
this and so we have this reflects of 

1340
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:17,380
idea and this is very much the case 
because this is like the core idea among

1341
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:22,381
the feminist Neil Marxist types is that 
if there's differences in outcome,

1342
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:23,823
that's that's proof of prejudice and 
that support for the idea of the 

1343
01:06:28,031 --> 01:06:28,864
patriarchal tyranny and that's like the 
core axiom of the radical left is the 

1344
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:34,450
patriarchal tyranny.
As far as I'm concerned.

1345
01:06:34,451 --> 01:06:37,690
That's that's God for them to 
patriarchal tyranny.

1346
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:38,823
It's like,
well,

1347
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:39,723
if it turns out that many of these 
differences in outcome between men and 

1348
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:44,950
women aren't a consequence of the 
patriarchal tyranny,

1349
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:49,660
in fact even get bigger.
When you reduce the tyrannical aspect of

1350
01:06:49,661 --> 01:06:52,150
the patriarch and even the patriarchal 
aspect to it.

1351
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:57,360
Then it makes that theory not only wrong
but opposite of the truth,

1352
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:00,220
which is the worst kind of wrong.

1353
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:05,230
And so you know,
if men are more likely to pursue careers

1354
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:06,064
in the stem fields,
which seems to be the case under 

1355
01:07:07,721 --> 01:07:10,270
conditions of optimal freedom for men 
and women,

1356
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,313
then that's going to drive income 
disparities because the stem fields pay 

1357
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:16,450
more and they pay more.
Partly because they're scalable,

1358
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,690
like it's really hard to scale care for 
people.

1359
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,400
You know,
like if you work in a daycare,

1360
01:07:21,401 --> 01:07:22,234
you're going to care for three infants,
you're not going to care for 50 because 

1361
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:26,020
you can't,
it's not scalable.

1362
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,290
But if you're like a software designer,
it's infinitely scalable.

1363
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:30,124
And so there's,
there's a much wider range of possible 

1364
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:36,460
of possibility for generating much 
larger,

1365
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:41,380
much larger income pools and much larger
pools of wealth,

1366
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,513
you know,
and men are also more likely to work 

1367
01:07:43,301 --> 01:07:45,970
longer hours.
And if you work 10 percent longer hours,

1368
01:07:45,971 --> 01:07:48,970
you make 40 percent more money.
There's a nonlinear return on.

1369
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:52,180
That's good thing for everybody who's 
listening to know if you have a job,

1370
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,253
you want to be the guy or the woman 
who's working that extra 10 percent 

1371
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,270
because the return on that is non 
linear.

1372
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:01,750
So that's a really useful thing to know.
Men are more likely to work outside.

1373
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:03,760
They're more likely to work in dangerous
businesses.

1374
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,713
They're more likely to run fulltime 
businesses rather than part time 

1375
01:08:07,481 --> 01:08:09,270
businesses.
And uh,

1376
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,070
they're more likely to move in pursuit 
of their career goals.

1377
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:15,720
And that all contributes to differences 
in and in,

1378
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:17,690
in Uber drivers,
they're,

1379
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:18,583
they make seven percent more money 
because they drive faster so and so 

1380
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:23,660
anyways.
That's not good though.

1381
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,020
I'll know.
But it's a high risk,

1382
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:29,260
high return issue.
It's a pattern mail.

1383
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,160
It's common,
it's more risk,

1384
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,023
there's more risk in it.
So there's more return as long as you 

1385
01:08:33,591 --> 01:08:34,424
don't get hurt.
And I think that's a pretty common male 

1386
01:08:36,621 --> 01:08:37,454
pattern is there's more risk is there's 
more return as long as you don't get 

1387
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:40,724
hurt.
Problem seems to be when discussing 

1388
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:42,974
these things in any way romanticizing or
glorifying male behavior or putting any 

1389
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:55,700
emphasis whatsoever on their being a,
a positive aspect to a lot of the things

1390
01:08:55,701 --> 01:08:59,960
that we think of as being negative,
like aggression or ambition or,

1391
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:02,060
or,
or competition.

1392
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:03,081
And Yeah.
Yeah.

1393
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:05,210
Well the competition amongst men is 
fine.

1394
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,630
Competition with men against women is 
often thought of as cruel.

1395
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,213
Yeah.
Well that.

1396
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:11,661
Yes.
Well,

1397
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:12,140
and,
and,

1398
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:12,973
and there's a certain amount of reason 
for that as well because obviously 

1399
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:19,730
physical competition is,
it's easy for that to border on.

1400
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:21,340
Cruel.
This is why we were shocked.

1401
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,980
We were talking before the show that 
instead of calling people,

1402
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:25,843
men and women when referring to like 
because there's this very disturbing in 

1403
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:34,400
my opinion,
trend of transgender women entering into

1404
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:35,503
these competitions now with women who 
are biologically female and dominating 

1405
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,780
them and that instead of calling people,
men and women,

1406
01:09:41,781 --> 01:09:44,550
let's dispense with them.
You can just say,

1407
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:46,280
yeah,
you can be a man or woman.

1408
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,530
That's your choice and you can change it
whenever you want,

1409
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,440
so your man or a woman and that's your 
choice,

1410
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:55,370
but we're going to have a new rule which
is that if you have an x,

1411
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:56,930
y chromosome,
so you're an x,

1412
01:09:56,931 --> 01:10:00,320
y person or an xx person than if you're 
an x,

1413
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,520
x person,
x,

1414
01:10:01,521 --> 01:10:02,150
y person.

1415
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:04,640
You don't get to engage in physical 
combat with an x,

1416
01:10:04,641 --> 01:10:05,870
y person.
Yes.

1417
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,110
Men or one x person mass.
Yeah.

1418
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,290
How would that.
If you're x,

1419
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:11,720
Y,
you can't engage in physical combat with

1420
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:12,480
Xs,
right?

1421
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,380
X Ys cannot hit xxs.
How's that?

1422
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:16,423
And maybe they can't run in cotton 
running contests against them and maybe 

1423
01:10:20,331 --> 01:10:22,510
they can't play tennis against them 
knowing within.

1424
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:25,740
And maybe that's just reasonable is 
reason.

1425
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:27,320
Yes,
it is certainly reasonable,

1426
01:10:27,321 --> 01:10:30,730
but if you talk about that,
especially someone like you was,

1427
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:31,603
you were against this bill that was 
going to enforce these pronouns and the 

1428
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:37,303
compelling the use of these pronouns 
that your thought to be transphobic 

1429
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:47,020
person because you feel like there maybe
should be some rational discussion about

1430
01:10:47,781 --> 01:10:50,780
the physical limitations of certain body
structures because that's what it is.

1431
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:53,600
If you're talking about my field of 
business,

1432
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:54,643
you're talking about combat.
I've been involved in combat sports my 

1433
01:10:57,111 --> 01:11:01,070
whole life and there is a difference.
And it's not to say that females aren't,

1434
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:04,820
aren't competent and I mean I had Miriam
Nakamoto on yesterday,

1435
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,833
she's a good friend of mine.
She's an eight time world champion and 

1436
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:09,463
she's a monster,
but she doesn't fight against men and 

1437
01:11:12,591 --> 01:11:14,160
you shouldn't fight against men,
although she's

1438
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,830
probably could beat a bunch of them.
Right?

1439
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:17,610
It's not.
She shouldn't have to.

1440
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,390
And she's a tough woman.
Can beat a variety of men.

1441
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,060
Oh yeah.
Really tough man can beat all women.

1442
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:24,841
Yes.
Right.

1443
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:26,800
So that's the problem.
That's the reality.

1444
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,210
And that is definitely,
you know,

1445
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:30,053
and people don't like to hear these 
things and they don't want to pretend 

1446
01:11:33,871 --> 01:11:36,360
that you can even out the playing field 
with hormones.

1447
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:37,403
No,
you can even at a little there certain 

1448
01:11:39,181 --> 01:11:40,014
things like I've always said you,
if you gave brock Lesnar a sex change 

1449
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:45,024
and put them in a dress,
he's going to run through every woman 

1450
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:49,380
that's ever lived in the history of 
women.

1451
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:53,040
There's not a single woman is going to 
be able to deal with that bone structure

1452
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,023
and that,
that mind that that guy has had with 

1453
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,770
testosterone pumping through it for 39 
years.

1454
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:02,420
So she's.
It's just preposterous that even to have

1455
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,910
to have the discussion.
It's so,

1456
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:04,763
so absolutely ridiculous.
The one thing that I was attacked on 

1457
01:12:07,171 --> 01:12:08,004
more than anything in my entire life is 
saying that I think it's ridiculous to 

1458
01:12:11,821 --> 01:12:15,000
have a trans woman compete against women
and mixed martial arts.

1459
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,160
I was like,
you want to have them do it in chess.

1460
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:19,470
You want to have them do it in something
that's nonphysical.

1461
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:21,450
Sure.
You want them to be a woman.

1462
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,313
Yes.
Okay.

1463
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,880
You want them to be recognized as a 
woman,

1464
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,030
you sure,
but it's Mr.

1465
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,420
compelling people like,
here's one that's going up lately.

1466
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:32,660
If you don't want to date a trans woman 
than you are some sort of a bigot.

1467
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,730
But if you're a man,
you know,

1468
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:37,170
even if you want a family,

1469
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:38,820
you know what you remember in,
in,

1470
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,700
in a brave new world,
in Huxley's book,

1471
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:42,923
It was considered immoral to reject 
anyone sexual advances because it was 

1472
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:48,540
prejudicial.
Oh yes.

1473
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:50,400
And the thing is,
it is prejudicial.

1474
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:54,110
That's the thing now,
but the seeds.

1475
01:12:54,111 --> 01:12:54,944
So that makes the question even more 
interesting because the question is at 

1476
01:12:57,661 --> 01:13:01,540
what point do you have the right to your
prejudices and what?

1477
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:04,290
One of the things that we seem to cling 
to,

1478
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:05,843
and I would say rightly,
is that we're allowed to be prejudice 

1479
01:13:09,391 --> 01:13:10,224
when it comes to who we interact with 
sexually and then and who we choose as 

1480
01:13:14,131 --> 01:13:15,630
friends.
And that's right.

1481
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:18,320
That's the right to association.
And you know,

1482
01:13:18,321 --> 01:13:20,760
you said only up to a certain point.
Well that's.

1483
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:21,743
This is because this,
this new logic is kind of leaking into 

1484
01:13:25,671 --> 01:13:26,504
your sexual preference.
Now like if you have a problem with 

1485
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:30,660
someone being overweight,
yeah.

1486
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:33,550
Then you're a scientist or something 
like that.

1487
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:34,830
Like what is that?
Well,

1488
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:35,664
the thing is is that you can't have 
preferences without having prejudices 

1489
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:39,310
course.
Right?

1490
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:41,010
So that's a big.
That's a big issue.

1491
01:13:41,011 --> 01:13:43,230
So what does that mean?
You don't get to have any preferences.

1492
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:44,123
How's that gonna work out in terms of 
like what you like to eat or what kind 

1493
01:13:47,491 --> 01:13:49,410
of films you enjoy or what kind of books
you read.

1494
01:13:49,411 --> 01:13:50,580
You're allowed to have these 
preferences.

1495
01:13:50,581 --> 01:13:52,590
But when it comes to what you're 
sexually attracted to,

1496
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:58,130
there's new emphasis now trying to draw 
that line and say like wait,

1497
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,113
but it's preposterous.
People that are pushing this and I've 

1498
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:01,283
almost everybody's pushing back,
but I find it interesting when these 

1499
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,224
things come logical,
it's a logical conclusion to all these 

1500
01:14:06,091 --> 01:14:06,924
other things that have been happening 
because that is where the rubber hits 

1501
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:10,170
the road.
It's like,

1502
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,160
you know,
when,

1503
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,030
when I,
when I.

1504
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,040
Well,

1505
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,570
I've seen this in debates that I've had 
publicly where people,

1506
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:17,573
you know,
talk about prejudice and I've pointed 

1507
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:20,734
out to them that they have prejudicial 
attitudes with regards to their sexual 

1508
01:14:23,051 --> 01:14:25,600
preferences because they don't just 
sleep with anyone who asks them.

1509
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:27,070
Right?
So it's like,

1510
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:28,630
well,
how is that not a prejudice?

1511
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:30,790
Well,
of course it's a prejudice.

1512
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,470
Well then the question is under what 
circumstances are prejudices justifiable

1513
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:36,483
and that's a conversation we don't like 
to have because we believe that there 

1514
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:43,750
are no circumstances whatsoever under 
which prejudices are are acceptable.

1515
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,480
There's a big difference between 
prejudice and discrimination.

1516
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:48,970
I think those two get conflated.
Yes,

1517
01:14:48,971 --> 01:14:49,804
there is a big difference between 
prejudice and discrimination and all 

1518
01:14:53,711 --> 01:14:54,544
totally discrimination has to do with 
setting your standards in relationship 

1519
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:02,650
to the task at hand.
That's what you'd hope for that.

1520
01:15:02,651 --> 01:15:05,710
That's the appropriate forms of 
discrimination.

1521
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,600
Rats,
that's like intelligence.

1522
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,570
Sure.
Everything is.

1523
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:11,860
Everything isn't the same about 
everything all the time.

1524
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:12,993
So you discriminate,
you rank order things and you need to 

1525
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:17,590
rank order them even to pursue things 
that are valuable.

1526
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:20,890
This is one of the problems with the 
people who are so anti hierarchy,

1527
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:24,250
like the like the radical leftists,
while there shouldn't be hierarchies,

1528
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:24,911
it's like,
okay,

1529
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:29,911
then why do something that that argument
is so foolhardy that it's.

1530
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,473
It's difficult to take seriously,
but you do have to engage in it and I 

1531
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:39,130
think when you engage in it,
it's really fascinating to watch because

1532
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:41,163
it's like you're playing a game of chess
with someone only has a couple of 

1533
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,450
pieces.
They have this strong move that they do,

1534
01:15:46,451 --> 01:15:48,250
but you've got all these other pieces 
and you're like,

1535
01:15:48,251 --> 01:15:49,084
well,
let's just keep this game going until 

1536
01:15:50,861 --> 01:15:53,260
this comes to this logical conclusion,
which is checkmate.

1537
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,450
There's hierarchies all throughout 
nature.

1538
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:57,850
It doesn't mean people should suppress 
people,

1539
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,560
doesn't mean people shouldn't have 
rights.

1540
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:00,543
It doesn't mean people should enforce 
themselves or force themselves on other 

1541
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:04,450
folks.
That's not what it means.

1542
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:06,160
It also doesn't mean that the 
hierarchies,

1543
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:10,660
especially if they're human hierarchies 
done well or or or that they're only.

1544
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:11,553
That's right.
Not that they're good necessarily or 

1545
01:16:13,121 --> 01:16:13,954
that they're predicated going power,
like one of the most pathological 

1546
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:17,494
elements of the postmodern types.
Especially people like food is their 

1547
01:16:20,621 --> 01:16:21,454
insistence that all hierarchical 
structures are predicated on power and 

1548
01:16:24,731 --> 01:16:27,820
that there's nothing other than power 
and that's completely preposterous.

1549
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:28,863
I mean,
I use examples of plumbers in my 

1550
01:16:30,701 --> 01:16:33,490
lectures more recently because it's 
rather comical,

1551
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:34,533
so like,
well,

1552
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:35,733
on what basis do you hire a plumber?
So imagine that there's a hierarchy of 

1553
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:41,350
plumbers ranging from very successful to
very unsuccessful.

1554
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:42,281
Okay.
And you say,

1555
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:44,200
well,
what makes plumbers successful?

1556
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:47,340
Well,
the power theory would,

1557
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,433
would imply that there are roving bands 
of mafioso plumbers who like come 

1558
01:16:52,211 --> 01:16:53,044
pounding on your door at three in the 
morning and tell you that if you don't 

1559
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:59,680
get their particular posy to fix your 
pipes leaking or not,

1560
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,450
that they're going to come and burn down
your house.

1561
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:02,890
Of course,
that's completely.

1562
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:04,123
It's completely absurd.
When you go to hire someone like a 

1563
01:17:07,451 --> 01:17:08,284
plumber,
well the first thing you want to know 

1564
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:12,410
his reputation,
can they actually fix a pipe because you

1565
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:14,420
actually want your pipe fixed and then 
you want to know,

1566
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:15,890
well,
do they deal with you fairly?

1567
01:17:15,891 --> 01:17:16,724
And part of what's tangled up in that in
all likelihood is do they deal with 

1568
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:20,384
their employees fairly because that's 
going to make their business function 

1569
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:25,250
properly.
And so the hierarchy of plumbers,

1570
01:17:25,251 --> 01:17:27,260
which is part of the patriarchal 
tyranny,

1571
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,990
is almost entirely predicated on 
competence.

1572
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:34,730
And almost every enterprise in the west 
is like that.

1573
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,990
Because I keep wondering,
well,

1574
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,270
where the hell is this patriarchal 
tyranny?

1575
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:42,490
Like is it massage therapists?
Is it nurses?

1576
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:43,603
Most nurses are female.
If you get females organized into a 

1577
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:48,110
hierarchy,
which you do in nursing,

1578
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:49,213
is that all of a sudden,
is that part of the patriarchal tyranny 

1579
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:54,350
or is it the fact that no,
all those people are women?

1580
01:17:54,351 --> 01:17:55,820
Does that mean it's no longer?
Well,

1581
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,610
it still hierarchy.
Is it no longer a tyranny?

1582
01:17:58,930 --> 01:17:59,763
Is it no longer patriarchal?
Like is it patriarchal only because 

1583
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:02,594
there's men in it?
Or is it patriarchal because it's a 

1584
01:18:03,891 --> 01:18:08,450
hierarchy of this stuff is so incoherent
that it just all you have to do is think

1585
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:09,284
about it and,
and that hasn't been done to any great 

1586
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:13,150
degree and it just dissolves in your 
hands.

1587
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,053
That's what I'm saying is that if you're
entering into a job straight out of 

1588
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:17,834
college,
you leave university and now you're 

1589
01:18:19,701 --> 01:18:20,990
entering into,
you know,

1590
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:23,550
your first year in the workplace,
it's,

1591
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:24,953
it's just a natural fact of life that 
there's going to be people that are 

1592
01:18:28,191 --> 01:18:31,700
further ahead in this race than you 
because they're better at what they do.

1593
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:34,310
Some of the more experienced and more 
education.

1594
01:18:34,311 --> 01:18:37,980
Some of them are more crooked and snitch
too as well because the.

1595
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:40,220
But it's the.
It's the agreeing.

1596
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:42,910
Everyone agreeing that this is a game.
Yeah.

1597
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,773
This is some sort of a competition and 
you're going to have hierarchies in 

1598
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:47,084
competitions.
You're going to have people who when 

1599
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:51,130
you're going to have people who do 
better no matter what the thing,

1600
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:53,770
so that's the fundamental issue.
As soon as you said,

1601
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:55,760
we could look at it this way,
as soon as you.

1602
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:59,570
Let's assume people have problems,
everybody can agree on that,

1603
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:03,290
then we could assume that people would 
like solutions to those problems,

1604
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:05,390
so we could agree on that.
Then we could say,

1605
01:19:05,391 --> 01:19:08,180
well then if you implement a solution 
socially,

1606
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:09,093
so with other people,
then you're going to cooperate and 

1607
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:11,954
compete in relationship to the solution 
and that's instantly going to produce a 

1608
01:19:14,631 --> 01:19:17,240
hierarchy because no matter what the 
problem is,

1609
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:18,163
some people are going to be better at 
solving it than others and then if you 

1610
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:21,464
have any sense,
you put the people who are good at 

1611
01:19:22,431 --> 01:19:23,264
solving it at the forefront because then
they solve it faster and cheaper and 

1612
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:29,270
better and then everybody benefits,
but then you get a hierarchy,

1613
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:29,780
right?

1614
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:30,613
The people who solve those problems get 
financial incentive to solve those 

1615
01:19:34,941 --> 01:19:35,630
problems.
Yes.

1616
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:39,260
And they it and they do that because the
rest of us are greedy and desperate.

1617
01:19:39,261 --> 01:19:40,430
It's like,
you know,

1618
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:41,264
we want the people who are good at 
solving the problems to keep solving 

1619
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,233
them,
and so what we're trying to do is to 

1620
01:19:45,861 --> 01:19:46,694
reward them so that they'll keep doing 
it even if it's difficult to give them 

1621
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:52,300
some status and extraordinarily if,
if necessary.

1622
01:19:52,301 --> 01:19:52,880
Yes.
Yes.

1623
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,150
When you look at the people that are the
head of giant industry,

1624
01:19:56,151 --> 01:19:56,984
the ceos of super successful companies,
they're the ones that have the giant 

1625
01:19:59,451 --> 01:20:00,284
yachts and the big houses and this is 
the incentive for people to try to get 

1626
01:20:03,261 --> 01:20:04,094
to that position and the idea that 
there's no incentive and that there 

1627
01:20:06,141 --> 01:20:08,160
should be no incentive,
but yet you're still gonna have all this

1628
01:20:08,161 --> 01:20:09,750
innovation is ridiculous.

1629
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:12,180
It's not how it works.
It's not how human beings work.

1630
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,910
If human beings are going to work really
hard,

1631
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,833
there has to be some sort of a reward 
and it can't be an equal voice and then 

1632
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,580
then what you could say like,
so okay,

1633
01:20:20,581 --> 01:20:23,280
so the right that that would be roughly 
speaking,

1634
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:24,114
a conservative position,
and then you can take a left wing 

1635
01:20:26,131 --> 01:20:27,660
position that's reasonable and you can 
say,

1636
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:29,880
yes,
there are hierarchies,

1637
01:20:29,881 --> 01:20:34,881
but we have to stay awake because they 
can degenerate into power hungry tyranny

1638
01:20:35,301 --> 01:20:36,134
so that it's no longer competence.
It's political machination and game 

1639
01:20:39,931 --> 01:20:40,764
playing and tyranny that that produced 
the positional positional 

1640
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:45,054
differentiation.
So we got to stay awake to that and so 

1641
01:20:47,851 --> 01:20:51,120
we got to criticize the hierarchies.
Not the fact of hierarchy,

1642
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:51,954
but the structure of hierarchy so they 
stay honest and then we also have to be 

1643
01:20:54,511 --> 01:20:56,790
careful because when you do set up a 
hierarchy,

1644
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,580
then a lot of people collect at the 
bottom.

1645
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,133
That's the necessary consequence of a 
few people collecting at the top and so 

1646
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:04,884
then you have to be concerned about 
those people at the bottom and so 

1647
01:21:06,811 --> 01:21:10,560
there's a variety of things that you 
would do to express that concern is one,

1648
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:11,394
you might want to have a lot of 
hierarchies so that people have 

1649
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:16,590
different talents,
could play different games and a complex

1650
01:21:16,591 --> 01:21:17,424
society is pretty good at that,
but you're still gonna have people who 

1651
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,480
stack up at the bottom of all 
hierarchies.

1652
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:22,680
Right?
And those are going to be people who are

1653
01:21:22,681 --> 01:21:23,514
sick mentally and physically and maybe 
people who are cognitively impaired or 

1654
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:30,420
you know or have experienced some kind 
of catastrophe in their life.

1655
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,553
And then you,
you want to set up your system so that 

1656
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:34,343
those people don't suffer unduly.
Partly because that's bad and partly 

1657
01:21:38,001 --> 01:21:40,140
because that destabilizes your whole 
society.

1658
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:43,920
And so you could say,
well that's the left's place is to speak

1659
01:21:43,921 --> 01:21:44,754
for the speak on behalf of the unjustly 
dispossessed and the rights position is 

1660
01:21:50,131 --> 01:21:50,964
to stabilize and maintain functional 
hierarchies and encourage competition 

1661
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:59,280
and encourage competition that's of 
benefit to the whole and,

1662
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,050
and to the individuals within the 
competition.

1663
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,033
And then the political dialogue is a 
continual discussion between the left 

1664
01:22:05,581 --> 01:22:06,630
and the right saying,
well,

1665
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:08,130
you know,
at this hierarchies getting a little too

1666
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:10,470
steep and a little too rigid and,
and,

1667
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:11,850
and,
and well.

1668
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:12,601
And that's,
for me,

1669
01:22:12,601 --> 01:22:17,070
that's also the fundamental reason for 
the necessity of free speech.

1670
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:19,980
It's because that's the only way to 
discuss this.

1671
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:20,893
It is the only,
that's the only way of working it out 

1672
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:23,003
and it is the case you need,
you're going to produce hierarchies if 

1673
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:25,974
you're going to pursue things of value 
socially going to pre produce 

1674
01:22:27,991 --> 01:22:30,720
hierarchies and they're necessary.
And there's also,

1675
01:22:30,721 --> 01:22:31,554
I have a giant issue with the concept 
that these things are mutually 

1676
01:22:33,511 --> 01:22:36,540
exclusive,
that you can't have competition and also

1677
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:41,130
have a good social environment.
I think that's preposterous idea.

1678
01:22:41,131 --> 01:22:41,964
I mean,
one of the things I really like about 

1679
01:22:42,871 --> 01:22:45,390
the psychologist,
Sean Piaget,

1680
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:46,253
who said I would say the world's 
foremost expert on games is that he did 

1681
01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:53,220
a very careful analysis of say,
competitive games.

1682
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:55,530
Okay,
so let's take hockey or soccer.

1683
01:22:55,531 --> 01:22:56,850
It doesn't matter.
Same example.

1684
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,253
You say,
well,

1685
01:22:58,310 --> 01:23:01,890
because people now they have kids play 
these games and don't keep score,

1686
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:02,903
which of course the kids keep score 
because they're not stupid like the 

1687
01:23:04,531 --> 01:23:05,710
adults.
But you know,

1688
01:23:05,711 --> 01:23:06,010
while we

1689
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,690
can't have it be competitive.
Okay,

1690
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:09,160
so let's take it apart.
It's like,

1691
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:10,203
well,
is hockey a competitive game or a 

1692
01:23:11,351 --> 01:23:12,940
cooperative game?
Okay,

1693
01:23:12,941 --> 01:23:13,990
well,
so first of all,

1694
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:18,010
everyone's trying to do the same thing 
that's cooperative.

1695
01:23:18,011 --> 01:23:20,470
It's not like half the people are 
playing chess and another,

1696
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:22,420
you know,
a third of them brought a basketball and

1697
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:23,373
two of them are boxing and well 
sometimes they do in hockey boxing in a 

1698
01:23:26,261 --> 01:23:27,094
corner,
but everyone's trying to do the same 

1699
01:23:28,181 --> 01:23:29,800
thing.
So that's cooperative.

1700
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,260
Okay.
Everyone plays their position.

1701
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:35,380
That's cooperative.
They all followed the same rules.

1702
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:37,330
That's cooperative,
right?

1703
01:23:37,331 --> 01:23:39,760
So,
so there's competition,

1704
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:44,380
but it's nested inside a fundamental 
structure of cooperation.

1705
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:49,300
And the cooperation is the cooperation 
is the basis of the game itself.

1706
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:50,283
Let's all arbitrarily agree that it's 
important to put this black disk in the 

1707
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:54,094
net,
which is to get your aim right and then 

1708
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:56,644
let's cooperate within our teams to do 
that because we're going to pass and 

1709
01:24:00,191 --> 01:24:01,930
we're going to,
we're going to pass each other and we're

1710
01:24:01,931 --> 01:24:04,420
also going to work so that each of us is
a good player,

1711
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:05,254
but so that we all work for the 
betterment of our team because we want 

1712
01:24:08,351 --> 01:24:10,630
to win games across multiple games.

1713
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:14,590
So that's also cooperative.
And then you want to interact with your,

1714
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:17,830
your enemies,
let's say the other team in a way that's

1715
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,730
indicative of good sportsman ship so 
that the entire league can flourish.

1716
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:24,310
And to think of that as competitive is 
absolutely.

1717
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:26,100
It's so,
um,

1718
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,233
I,
there's no other way of describing it 

1719
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:31,450
than stupid.
That's what it is.

1720
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:32,530
It's a,
it's a,

1721
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,140
it's an ignorant unit,
dimensional analysis.

1722
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,003
It's put forward by someone who's 
reflexively opposed to anything that 

1723
01:24:38,711 --> 01:24:41,860
smacks of competition and who isn't 
thinking it through at all.

1724
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:42,963
They're denying the benefits of 
competition and the fact that they 

1725
01:24:45,421 --> 01:24:49,170
reaped those benefits of competition by 
enjoying the products that are created

1726
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,460
by these corporations.
Yes.

1727
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:52,440
Well,
it's very hypocritical and.

1728
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:53,611
Well,
that's for sure.

1729
01:24:53,611 --> 01:24:55,590
That's called a performative 
contradiction.

1730
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:56,311
It's like,
well,

1731
01:24:56,311 --> 01:24:57,144
I'd like to.
I like to complain about left wing 

1732
01:24:58,561 --> 01:24:59,930
issues on my iphone.
Right,

1733
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:00,841
exactly.
You know,

1734
01:25:00,841 --> 01:25:01,441
it's like,
well,

1735
01:25:01,441 --> 01:25:02,850
yeah,
fair enough.

1736
01:25:02,851 --> 01:25:03,684
But you know,
used to have a little gratitude for the 

1737
01:25:04,681 --> 01:25:05,514
fact that you've got your iphone to 
complain about and those and those 

1738
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:08,783
organizations,
those corporations are unbelievably 

1739
01:25:11,491 --> 01:25:12,324
competitive unblend.
They fall apart almost instantly when 

1740
01:25:14,371 --> 01:25:16,920
that competition starts,
stops being a,

1741
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,053
an issue because then there's no 
constraint on the behavior of the 

1742
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:24,120
behavior of the system.
So yes,

1743
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:25,150
and you know,
the,

1744
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:27,630
the issue with men,
I think with young men,

1745
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:28,553
and this is one of the things I've been 
trying to address is that if your 

1746
01:25:30,661 --> 01:25:35,040
fundamental presupposition is that our 
culture is a patriarchal tyranny,

1747
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:39,390
which is an appalling presupposition 
along with the idea that the best way of

1748
01:25:39,391 --> 01:25:41,940
looking at history is that it,
it was the oppression,

1749
01:25:41,941 --> 01:25:44,220
the continual oppression of women by 
men.

1750
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:48,270
Which is also something that I regard as
absolutely reprehensible doctrine.

1751
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:49,591
Then,
okay,

1752
01:25:49,591 --> 01:25:51,030
so it's a patriarchal tyranny,

1753
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:52,103
but in their defense that did exist.
There has been continual oppression of 

1754
01:25:56,071 --> 01:25:56,904
women.
It's just not the only thing that's 

1755
01:25:57,691 --> 01:25:58,770
happened.
Well,

1756
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:01,230
there's been women that have been 
revered.

1757
01:26:01,231 --> 01:26:03,030
There's been women that have been 
celebrated.

1758
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,010
There's been women that

1759
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:06,560
have accomplished great things,
but there's been a lot of oppression.

1760
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,513
So if they concentrate primarily on that
oppression and that's their main point 

1761
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:12,770
of study and that's the thing they want 
to talk about all the time.

1762
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:17,000
They kind of have a point in the fact 
that if you're looking at all the events

1763
01:26:17,001 --> 01:26:17,834
that have ever taken place,
there's a significant number of them 

1764
01:26:19,701 --> 01:26:21,950
that have been women being oppressed.
That's a real thing.

1765
01:26:22,030 --> 01:26:22,863
I don't know if there's more women 
who've been oppressed than men who've 

1766
01:26:25,911 --> 01:26:27,230
been oppressed.
Very good point.

1767
01:26:27,231 --> 01:26:29,750
So I would say that the entire history 
of.

1768
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:30,793
I mean you look at it this way,
is that we oppress ourselves personally 

1769
01:26:34,491 --> 01:26:38,870
with our own malevolence and stupidity.
And then we're all oppressed by the kind

1770
01:26:38,871 --> 01:26:41,210
of the crushing hand of the social 
world.

1771
01:26:41,211 --> 01:26:43,400
That molds us in one way and not in 
another,

1772
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:48,050
and then of course nature is doing her 
best all the time to give birth to us,

1773
01:26:48,051 --> 01:26:53,051
but also to kill us and take us out,
and so there's this endless like there's

1774
01:26:53,661 --> 01:26:55,760
this endless,
what would you call it,

1775
01:26:55,761 --> 01:26:56,594
vulnerability that characterizes our 
existence psychologically and socially 

1776
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:00,644
and naturally and I would say a hundred 
and 50 years ago that was even more 

1777
01:27:03,321 --> 01:27:04,640
intense than it was now.

1778
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,473
You know,
because the typical person in the west 

1779
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:08,600
lived on less than a dollar a day before
18,

1780
01:27:08,601 --> 01:27:09,434
95,
and so the way I think that we should 

1781
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:13,304
view the history of the world is that 
men and women labored under virtually 

1782
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:16,784
impossible conditions for the entire 
bulk of human evolution and they did 

1783
01:27:20,121 --> 01:27:20,954
their best to cooperate and to compete,
but to cooperate so that they had some 

1784
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:27,403
modicum,
some possibility of a modicum of 

1785
01:27:30,441 --> 01:27:34,010
security and satisfaction and that 
that's the right framework.

1786
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:34,844
And then within that,
of course there's power games that are 

1787
01:27:36,681 --> 01:27:38,490
played by people who are corrupt.
Yeah.

1788
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:39,950
Within that,
there's horrible events.

1789
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,670
Of course they're taking place,
but there's a.

1790
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:42,523
there's a massive amount of hypocritical
thinking when you are criticizing the 

1791
01:27:46,251 --> 01:27:47,084
actions of so many people talking about 
how many people are complicit in these 

1792
01:27:50,811 --> 01:27:51,644
things while you're carrying around a 
phone that's made by someone who gets a 

1793
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,160
dollar a day.

1794
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,950
I was talking to a journalist in 
Slovenia,

1795
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:01,730
a who was a lefty and not a very 
sophisticated one,

1796
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:05,150
and she was talking about the one 
percent and I said,

1797
01:28:05,151 --> 01:28:05,984
well,
you know that if you make more than 

1798
01:28:06,561 --> 01:28:07,394
$32,000
a year that you're part of the one 

1799
01:28:08,721 --> 01:28:10,040
percent.
She said,

1800
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:10,731
well,
what do you mean?

1801
01:28:10,731 --> 01:28:11,181
I said,
well,

1802
01:28:11,181 --> 01:28:13,750
that's the worldwide statistic.
It's like,

1803
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,700
so you're part of the one percent.
Well,

1804
01:28:15,701 --> 01:28:16,850
she didn't.
First of all,

1805
01:28:16,851 --> 01:28:17,271
she said,
well,

1806
01:28:17,271 --> 01:28:19,060
I don't believe that statistic,
and I thought,

1807
01:28:19,061 --> 01:28:19,791
well,
that's fine.

1808
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:23,570
You can look it up yourself.
But what was so interesting was that for

1809
01:28:23,571 --> 01:28:26,900
her,
that characterization,

1810
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:28,063
the one percent victimizers was only 
relevant within the confines of her 

1811
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:33,280
national border.
Right?

1812
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:34,760
Soon as I said,
well,

1813
01:28:34,761 --> 01:28:35,594
no,
it's all you have to do is expand that 

1814
01:28:36,351 --> 01:28:38,990
out a little bit and you're the problem 
and not the solution.

1815
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:40,003
Then that was,
that was completely untenable for her 

1816
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:42,703
exam.
She couldn't include herself in the 

1817
01:28:43,671 --> 01:28:48,140
population of victimizers even though 
she lives in a Western country and she's

1818
01:28:48,141 --> 01:28:51,230
a well paid journalist and she's lived a
very privileged life,

1819
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:55,320
so to speak by historical standards to 
someone living in the Congo or something

1820
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:56,363
or or or anybody living anywhere in the 
entire history of the human race 

1821
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,113
opportunity.
Yeah,

1822
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,230
for sure.
If you make $34,000

1823
01:29:04,231 --> 01:29:05,064
today,
you absolutely are in the top one 

1824
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:08,070
percent of everybody who's ever though,
definitely.

1825
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:08,761
Well,
of course.

1826
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:09,750
Of course.
Yes,

1827
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:10,710
yes,
definitely.

1828
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:12,420
Especially given what you can buy with 
it.

1829
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:16,080
The only reason denied that is because 
it doesn't fit what you've come into.

1830
01:29:16,081 --> 01:29:17,490
The argument with,
it doesn't.

1831
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:22,491
It doesn't fit your pre k,
the pre predisposed notion that you have

1832
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:26,910
though your idea that you're.
It's so rigid.

1833
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:27,923
This idea that you are not one of the 
ones that's just carrying that iphone 

1834
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,433
with that laptop and all these different
things that you enjoy that are created 

1835
01:29:37,861 --> 01:29:41,940
by these corporations that you.
You support them financially,

1836
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,220
but yet they're the ones that are 
destroying this earth.

1837
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:47,160
These are the ones that you're rallying 
against these,

1838
01:29:47,170 --> 01:29:48,600
the ones that you hate against.
Yeah.

1839
01:29:48,601 --> 01:29:49,261
Well,
the victim,

1840
01:29:49,261 --> 01:29:52,320
victimizer narrative only works if you 
assume that you're a victim.

1841
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:53,213
Right,
and as soon as you assume that you're a 

1842
01:29:54,451 --> 01:29:56,430
victimizer,
well then it's not so much fun.

1843
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:01,640
One of the things I wrote the forward 
for the new version of of Solzhenitsyn's

1844
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:04,170
Gulag archipelago,
the abridged version.

1845
01:30:04,171 --> 01:30:05,004
It came out November first and I was 
trying to figure out why the Russian 

1846
01:30:08,011 --> 01:30:08,844
revolution went wrong so rapidly because
it went wrong right from the beginning 

1847
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:15,720
and they.
They sold units and quotes.

1848
01:30:15,721 --> 01:30:18,220
This guy named,
I think his name was Walter Lapsis,

1849
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,790
if I remember correctly.
He got the part right anyways,

1850
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:22,013
and he said,
when you're interrogating a member of 

1851
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:24,684
the bourgeoisie to decide whether they,
whether they constitute an enemy of the 

1852
01:30:30,391 --> 01:30:31,224
state,
you don't give any credibility to such 

1853
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:36,150
niceties as individual guilt or 
innocence.

1854
01:30:36,151 --> 01:30:36,984
All you care about is their group and 
their background and their economic 

1855
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:41,490
status,
and if they're in the wrong group,

1856
01:30:41,491 --> 01:30:44,130
the bourgeoisie,
then that's it.

1857
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:47,880
That's the end of them and and comments,
not just the end of them,

1858
01:30:47,881 --> 01:30:50,130
but the end of their children and their 
grandchildren as well,

1859
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:52,800
and lots.
This was eventually executed by Stalin.

1860
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:56,040
Somebody wrote me and just told me that 
after I wrote the forward,

1861
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,110
but one of the things I figured out was 
this,

1862
01:30:58,111 --> 01:30:59,940
and this is really worth thinking about 
man.

1863
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:04,350
So the intersection will claim is that 
you know,

1864
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:06,660
each person has more than one group 
identity.

1865
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:10,320
So fundamentally if you're going to 
calculate their victim status,

1866
01:31:10,321 --> 01:31:11,154
then you have to calculate it across all
the different groups that they might be 

1867
01:31:13,621 --> 01:31:16,260
victims in.
And so you know,

1868
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,830
maybe,
Oh,

1869
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:18,713
who knows,
a native American is one form of victim 

1870
01:31:21,001 --> 01:31:21,834
in this line of thinking,
but a native American victim is female 

1871
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:29,580
is like twice the victim or however you 
would calculate that mathematically.

1872
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:31,050
It's like,
okay,

1873
01:31:31,051 --> 01:31:31,884
and maybe you have,
maybe you can be put into six different 

1874
01:31:33,931 --> 01:31:34,764
groups.
We already talked about that a little 

1875
01:31:36,061 --> 01:31:38,040
bit,
but here's the bloody rub.

1876
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:42,120
If I put you in six groups in one of 
those groups,

1877
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:45,000
you're a victimizer.
You can bloody well bed on it.

1878
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:46,253
And then here's the next rule.
If you're a victimizer among any 

1879
01:31:49,501 --> 01:31:53,640
possible dimension of analysis,
then it's the gulag for you.

1880
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:57,390
And so that's the fundamental danger of 
that group identity,

1881
01:31:57,391 --> 01:31:58,500
victimizer,
victim,

1882
01:31:58,501 --> 01:32:00,010
new narrative is that you

1883
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:02,890
fragment your identity of multiple 
dimensions.

1884
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:05,650
You'll find out that you're a victimizer
and then everyone,

1885
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:08,350
then everyone's a criminal and then 
everyone's guilty.

1886
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:11,080
That's exactly what happened in Russia.
And then you think,

1887
01:32:11,081 --> 01:32:11,914
well,
wait a minute.

1888
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:14,590
There were a bunch of people who were 
really compassionate about the poor.

1889
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:16,750
It's like let's say just for the sake of
argument,

1890
01:32:16,751 --> 01:32:18,490
that at the beginning of the Russian 
revolution,

1891
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:21,850
that 20 percent of the communists were 
really concerned about the poor.

1892
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:26,860
Maybe we could say 50 percent just to be
arbitrary about it.

1893
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:30,730
The other 50 percent were jealous and 
resentful about anyone who anything more

1894
01:32:30,731 --> 01:32:32,110
than they did.
All right.

1895
01:32:32,111 --> 01:32:32,944
Now that you put those two groups,
head to head in a battle for four years 

1896
01:32:35,201 --> 01:32:36,034
and see who's standing at the end.
Even if you are one of those utopians 

1897
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:42,730
who actually cares for the dispossessed 
when the revolution comes,

1898
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:45,550
you can bloody well be sure that your 
head's going to be first on the chopping

1899
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:46,384
block because the people who are 
motivated by hate are going to be a lot 

1900
01:32:49,061 --> 01:32:50,950
more vicious in their attempts to 
eradicate.

1901
01:32:50,951 --> 01:32:53,260
Then you're going to be,
what would you call it,

1902
01:32:53,261 --> 01:32:54,094
effective in your,
in your attempts to save that whole 

1903
01:32:56,771 --> 01:32:57,604
game.
That whole identity politics game that 

1904
01:32:58,841 --> 01:32:59,674
is dangerous beyond belief and it's 
predicated fundamentally on resentment 

1905
01:33:03,731 --> 01:33:07,720
and the desire to devolve people back 
into tribal antagonism.

1906
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:09,043
I think it's so important that you talk 
about it this way and I think it's 

1907
01:33:10,851 --> 01:33:12,410
really interesting what I see the 
resistance.

1908
01:33:12,411 --> 01:33:13,244
Do you talk about it this way and how 
many people are unwilling to look at it 

1909
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,073
as this multilevel historical sort of 
record that you could look and see how 

1910
01:33:23,271 --> 01:33:24,104
this played out and you can look and see
what's going on right now with these 

1911
01:33:26,991 --> 01:33:27,824
control games that people are playing 
socially and that they are enforcing 

1912
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:32,173
certain types of behavior in certain 
ways of thinking and then trying to 

1913
01:33:34,551 --> 01:33:35,384
reign in earnings and raw rally against 
capitalism and support communism and 

1914
01:33:40,101 --> 01:33:42,800
socialism and doing so in this sort of 
weird,

1915
01:33:42,801 --> 01:33:43,634
trendy way without understanding the 
full scope of the historical 

1916
01:33:46,851 --> 01:33:47,684
implications when it's been tried in the
past and that it's not as simple as 

1917
01:33:50,301 --> 01:33:51,350
like,
you know,

1918
01:33:51,351 --> 01:33:52,220
uh,
you know,

1919
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:56,550
you got this and Ryan thing doing.
You're looking at this world.

1920
01:33:56,551 --> 01:33:57,880
DEB's,
you know,

1921
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:58,993
capitalism against socialism.
It's good people who care about folks 

1922
01:34:01,821 --> 01:34:04,820
versus people who are ruthless.
It's not that,

1923
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:06,533
well,
that isn't even how capitalism doesn't 

1924
01:34:07,781 --> 01:34:09,340
even work like that.
You know,

1925
01:34:09,341 --> 01:34:10,174
that managers are more stressed by the 
people they manage than the people they 

1926
01:34:12,791 --> 01:34:15,470
manage our stress by their managers.
I mean,

1927
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:16,450
then think about it,
right?

1928
01:34:16,451 --> 01:34:17,284
Just to all,
you have to think about that for a 

1929
01:34:17,921 --> 01:34:18,754
minute.
It's like you're an employee and you 

1930
01:34:20,441 --> 01:34:22,960
have a manager and the managers a bit of
a jerk,

1931
01:34:22,961 --> 01:34:24,490
let's say,
but there's 28,

1932
01:34:24,491 --> 01:34:26,760
you know,
so there's like you're kind of one slash

1933
01:34:26,761 --> 01:34:27,594
20th oppressed by the manager,
but now you're the manager and you're 

1934
01:34:30,251 --> 01:34:31,084
managing 20 people and you're 
responsible for them and we're assuming 

1935
01:34:33,311 --> 01:34:34,144
that you're not a psychopath and you're 
probably not because he probably 

1936
01:34:36,431 --> 01:34:37,264
wouldn't have been able to get to be a 
manager if you're a psychopath because 

1937
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:40,413
psychopaths generally aren't very 
successful and they have to keep moving 

1938
01:34:43,091 --> 01:34:47,620
as people figure out who they are.
So the idea that like psychopathic power

1939
01:34:47,621 --> 01:34:48,454
is a good route to power in a 
functioning organization is a stupid 

1940
01:34:50,831 --> 01:34:51,664
theory.
There are some organizations that are 

1941
01:34:53,441 --> 01:34:56,680
pathological enough so that works,
but they don't last very long either.

1942
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,010
So you're the

1943
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,843
manager and you're a decent human being 
and you've got 20 people who are 

1944
01:35:01,731 --> 01:35:04,460
dependent on you and at least two of 
those people are real trouble.

1945
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:07,080
Like they are serious trouble and 
they're there.

1946
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,233
They're your concern all the time.
And so you see this as and as people 

1947
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,124
move up the corporate hierarchies,
you think while they have more and more 

1948
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:15,880
power,
it's like,

1949
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,290
yeah,
but not really.

1950
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:22,850
They have more and more responsibility 
and their behavior is actually monitored

1951
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:24,013
with increasing severity.
It's like you're quite constrained in 

1952
01:35:27,981 --> 01:35:28,814
most high level positions of authority 
in complex organizations like you have 

1953
01:35:33,141 --> 01:35:33,974
to behave pretty damn carefully or 
you're going to get yourself in trouble 

1954
01:35:36,081 --> 01:35:37,010
very,
very quickly.

1955
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:40,130
We'll start today.
I think that that wasn't necessarily the

1956
01:35:40,131 --> 01:35:40,964
case a decade ago or two decades ago.
It was less the case unless the case 

1957
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:46,700
today it's far easier to get called out 
on things,

1958
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:50,150
but he but even so like you know,
even even 20 years ago,

1959
01:35:50,151 --> 01:35:50,984
like if you didn't treat your customers 
properly and carefully reciprocally in 

1960
01:35:55,551 --> 01:35:56,384
longterm relationships,
you are going to be a failure and you 

1961
01:35:58,401 --> 01:35:58,651
know,
in,

1962
01:35:58,651 --> 01:35:59,240
in,
in,

1963
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:02,330
in any corporation that,
that produces anything of any value.

1964
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:03,163
I mean the production is one thing.
So you have to be competent at the 

1965
01:36:04,911 --> 01:36:05,744
production,
but you have to be in constant 

1966
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,473
communication with your,
with your buyers and foster those 

1967
01:36:11,841 --> 01:36:12,674
relationships personally.
Because there's intense competition and 

1968
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:17,630
if those personal relationships aren't 
of high quality,

1969
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,673
then your business fails and one of the 
things I really learned because I spent 

1970
01:36:22,101 --> 01:36:25,040
a lot of time with business people as 
well as academics,

1971
01:36:25,041 --> 01:36:25,874
is that business people do a tremendous 
amount of socialization compared to 

1972
01:36:28,671 --> 01:36:29,504
academics.
Academics can judge each other's work 

1973
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,833
more or less on the basis of its 
scientific merit and so they don't have 

1974
01:36:35,991 --> 01:36:39,080
to establish personal relationships to 
the same degree,

1975
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:41,060
but business people are always 
wondering,

1976
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:42,020
well,
can I trust you?

1977
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:45,170
Can we enter into a reciprocal 
relationship that's going to be a mutual

1978
01:36:45,171 --> 01:36:46,004
benefit over the long run,
and so they're testing people out 

1979
01:36:47,991 --> 01:36:48,824
socially all the time and if you're not 
capable of reciprocating honestly over 

1980
01:36:53,331 --> 01:36:54,164
some decades say,
then you're going to screw things up in 

1981
01:36:57,051 --> 01:36:58,520
an absolutely horrible way.

1982
01:36:58,550 --> 01:37:00,650
It's one of the reasons why they like to
use golf as a matter of.

1983
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:01,461
Yes,
exactly.

1984
01:37:01,461 --> 01:37:03,470
That's as Dr is two things.
One,

1985
01:37:03,471 --> 01:37:04,304
you get to see how someone handles 
competition and we get to see if they 

1986
01:37:06,051 --> 01:37:06,800
cheat.
Yeah,

1987
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,670
because people do cheat and golf.
You know,

1988
01:37:08,671 --> 01:37:10,610
it was an interesting story.
A good friend of mine,

1989
01:37:10,611 --> 01:37:11,444
his,
uh,

1990
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:16,540
his dad was playing golf with this man 
and his wife was there as well,

1991
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:18,463
and the wife saw the dad moved the,
saw this man that he was playing golf 

1992
01:37:22,521 --> 01:37:24,440
with,
move the ball and she said,

1993
01:37:24,441 --> 01:37:27,380
do not go into business with this man.
Did not trust this man.

1994
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:31,010
He's a cheater.
He cheated at golf and he thought it was

1995
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:31,970
not that big a deal.
It's like,

1996
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:33,170
it's just a game of golf.
I'm just like,

1997
01:37:33,171 --> 01:37:34,130
no,
this is a big deal.

1998
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,050
It turns out the guy was a fucking 
criminal.

1999
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:37,790
Just took a while to find out.
I mean,

2000
01:37:37,791 --> 01:37:38,624
he wound up doing a lot of other things 
that how you do some things is 

2001
01:37:41,271 --> 01:37:42,740
oftentimes how you do everything.
Yeah.

2002
01:37:42,741 --> 01:37:46,310
Well that's why people are so interested
in games.

2003
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:46,960
Yes.
You know,

2004
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,190
because gave who a person really is well
games.

2005
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:51,433
This is again why I'm such an admirer of
Piaget because he knew very well that 

2006
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:56,010
game is a microcosm

2007
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,110
of reality.
That's why we like being.

2008
01:37:58,111 --> 01:38:00,690
You have to have an explanation for why 
people like games.

2009
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,570
I've been talking about this a lot in my
lectures too,

2010
01:38:03,571 --> 01:38:04,404
is you think,
well,

2011
01:38:04,910 --> 01:38:08,730
you know any game,
like any competitive game,

2012
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:09,593
soccer's a good example.
It's basically a hunting game because 

2013
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:15,990
you're.
You're firing a projectile at a target.

2014
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:17,640
Okay,
so the targets,

2015
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:19,020
the goal and the projectiles,
the ball,

2016
01:38:19,021 --> 01:38:21,410
but it doesn't matter is that so you 
have.

2017
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:25,260
You have teams that are figuring out how
to hunt properly.

2018
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:26,543
Then you think,
well to hunt properly you have to put 

2019
01:38:29,191 --> 01:38:31,980
the ball in the net as many times as you
possibly can.

2020
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:36,270
So and so you organize yourself in a 
hierarchy to facilitate that,

2021
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:37,373
but then that's,
that's not the whole story because you 

2022
01:38:39,571 --> 01:38:43,560
tell your kids,
doesn't matter whether you win or lose,

2023
01:38:43,561 --> 01:38:44,610
it matters how you play the game.

2024
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:49,050
And the kids all freaked out about that 
because he doesn't know what you mean.

2025
01:38:49,051 --> 01:38:49,591
And he says,
well,

2026
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:51,450
what do you mean doubt?
I'm trying to supposed to try to win.

2027
01:38:51,451 --> 01:38:53,010
And you say,
I don't know what I mean,

2028
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:55,050
but it's,
it's still true.

2029
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:59,310
But here's what you mean is that if 
you're in a league,

2030
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:00,960
you're not trying to win the soccer 
game,

2031
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:05,400
you're trying to win the soccer 
championship and to win the championship

2032
01:39:05,401 --> 01:39:06,234
you have to win a whole bunch of games 
and the rules to win a whole bunch of 

2033
01:39:09,331 --> 01:39:11,490
games aren't the same as the rules to 
win one game.

2034
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:12,773
You know,
like you could go flat out as the 

2035
01:39:13,471 --> 01:39:14,304
Premadonna and bend and bend the rules 
and cut corners and exhaust every one 

2036
01:39:17,401 --> 01:39:18,234
and win the game and then lose the next 
three because that's a stupid medium to 

2037
01:39:20,821 --> 01:39:21,654
longterm strategy.
Or You could be like the superstar and 

2038
01:39:24,421 --> 01:39:27,330
hog the ball at the time and never give 
your teammates a chance to develop.

2039
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:28,890
But then you're injured and you're team 
is out.

2040
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:31,320
So those,
that's a stupid strategy too.

2041
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,520
So you think,
well,

2042
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:34,013
what you have to do to win the 
championship is that you have to 

2043
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:39,210
organize your team so that the best 
players lead,

2044
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:40,223
but that everybody gets developed and 
that you play the medium to longterm 

2045
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:46,110
game in a fair way,
in a fair and decent way.

2046
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:47,161
Okay?
So you think,

2047
01:39:47,161 --> 01:39:47,994
well that's how you win a championship.
I talked to a coach a while back and he 

2048
01:39:50,371 --> 01:39:55,371
said one of the things he did to select 
athletes was to watch what happened when

2049
01:39:55,561 --> 01:39:59,730
they scored a goal and if they were 
celebrating on their own,

2050
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,710
you know,
in sort of an egotistical way,

2051
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:06,090
then that wasn't such a good sign,
but if they scored a goal or a touchdown

2052
01:40:06,091 --> 01:40:06,924
or whatever it was and their whole 
entire team came in and bombed them and 

2053
01:40:08,881 --> 01:40:09,714
then like lifted them up on their 
shoulders and he thought that guy is an 

2054
01:40:12,091 --> 01:40:16,020
athlete because not only can he put the 
goal,

2055
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:17,183
put the ball in the net,
but he does it in a way that benefits 

2056
01:40:19,321 --> 01:40:22,410
the entire team and that's the person 
you weren't around for the long run.

2057
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:25,800
And so then the goal isn't just to put 
the ball in the goal.

2058
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:26,663
The goal is to put the ball in the goal 
the the largest number of times while 

2059
01:40:30,661 --> 01:40:34,680
simultaneously benefiting as many as you
have your fellow players as you can.

2060
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:36,000
Although no,
I think

2061
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:36,833
that's a great strategy.
I don't think that's necessarily the 

2062
01:40:38,041 --> 01:40:40,140
meaning of it doesn't matter if you win 
or lose,

2063
01:40:40,141 --> 01:40:40,974
it's how you play the game.
I think what I don't think people think 

2064
01:40:43,111 --> 01:40:43,944
of it in terms of like a longterm 
strategy for championship leagues will 

2065
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:49,860
take when they're saying it doesn't 
matter whether you win or lose,

2066
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:52,860
it's how you play the game.
Meaning don't cheat.

2067
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:54,010
Do your

2068
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,050
best and learn.
Right?

2069
01:40:56,051 --> 01:41:00,310
But I think that's right.
While learn how to handle failure,

2070
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:04,960
learn how to handle victory will also 
learn from the experience itself.

2071
01:41:04,961 --> 01:41:08,680
Like if you make a mistake and you,
you're trying your hardest,

2072
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:11,770
but you make an error because someone 
has a counter to that.

2073
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:14,380
Then you learn from that.
That's how you play the game.

2074
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,033
You play it so stupidly and you don't 
think and you win just because you got 

2075
01:41:20,381 --> 01:41:21,214
lucky.
That's not as good as playing 

2076
01:41:22,661 --> 01:41:23,494
intelligently and expanding your skills 
and losing yes because the other people 

2077
01:41:26,621 --> 01:41:30,640
are superior and then you learn from the
fact that they figured out a way to have

2078
01:41:30,641 --> 01:41:32,930
solutions to all the problems that you 
presented this.

2079
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:33,491
Okay,
so,

2080
01:41:33,491 --> 01:41:34,324
so one of the things that you're 
pointing out is that while you're 

2081
01:41:35,831 --> 01:41:36,664
playing,
you want to be expanding your range of 

2082
01:41:38,111 --> 01:41:40,720
skills so that you get better at playing
the next game,

2083
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:41,793
but then you think,
well even the soccer championship isn't 

2084
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:45,130
the whole game,
right?

2085
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:47,260
Because your life is a whole series of 
games,

2086
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:48,123
of,
of,

2087
01:41:48,190 --> 01:41:50,350
of championships,
of different types of ideas.

2088
01:41:50,351 --> 01:41:53,920
The championships will come if you 
continue to excel and get excellent.

2089
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:56,590
Yes.
And also if people invite you to play.

2090
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:57,483
Yes.
So there's both of those are the two 

2091
01:41:59,591 --> 01:42:01,300
things.
So that's the goal,

2092
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:02,463
right?
The goal isn't to put the ball in the 

2093
01:42:03,161 --> 01:42:03,994
net,
the goal is to get excellent and to be 

2094
01:42:05,771 --> 01:42:06,604
invited to play.
And the mechanism is that you put the 

2095
01:42:08,981 --> 01:42:09,814
ball in the goal and that makes sense.
See that helps explain why people find 

2096
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:14,253
competitive sports.
So unbelievably compelling because you 

2097
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:18,550
can be cynical about it and you can say,
well look,

2098
01:42:18,551 --> 01:42:20,470
there's 50,000
people there watching,

2099
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:22,320
you know,
somebody kick a,

2100
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:23,273
uh,
a spheroid object into a net who the 

2101
01:42:25,121 --> 01:42:27,200
hell cares like,
and,

2102
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,690
but,
but that's not the issue.

2103
01:42:28,691 --> 01:42:29,524
What you're,
what you are in fact doing is you're 

2104
01:42:31,001 --> 01:42:31,834
going there to watch people develop 
expertise and to learn to play 

2105
01:42:36,731 --> 01:42:37,564
reciprocally in a noble and ethical 
manner and all of that sport when it's 

2106
01:42:41,741 --> 01:42:42,574
done properly is a direct physical 
incarnation of that ethic and so it's 

2107
01:42:48,011 --> 01:42:48,844
not surprising that that's why people 
get so excited when they see an athlete 

2108
01:42:51,731 --> 01:42:52,564
do something.

2109
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:53,403
Imagine the best thing that you can see 
at a sports event is someone who does 

2110
01:42:56,861 --> 01:42:57,694
something.
I'm purely in the spirit of fair play 

2111
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:03,820
and in a manner that's unbelievably 
excellent,

2112
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:05,860
right?
Wayne Gretzky was very good at that,

2113
01:43:06,490 --> 01:43:07,600
right?
Because he was an excellent,

2114
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:11,350
excellent sportsmen and also 
unbelievably skilled and so people loved

2115
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:13,210
them and that's,
that's perfect because he was,

2116
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,073
he was a player who played the game,
like it was more important to play it 

2117
01:43:17,201 --> 01:43:20,530
properly then to win and he was on the 
top of his game at the same time.

2118
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:23,260
And that's what you want to be 
enlightened and cut corners.

2119
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:25,210
That's right.
There is no cutting corners.

2120
01:43:25,211 --> 01:43:26,980
Yeah.
And so that's very cool.

2121
01:43:26,981 --> 01:43:29,770
And you see a very high order ethic 
emerge out of that.

2122
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:32,110
You want to be the kind of player that 
everybody.

2123
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:35,040
I kind of wrote about that in 12 rules 
for life when you know,

2124
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:36,033
because part of my advice in rule five 
was not to let your kids do anything 

2125
01:43:38,351 --> 01:43:39,184
that makes you dislike them,
and that's part of the idea there is 

2126
01:43:42,251 --> 01:43:43,084
that you know,
if you're really on the side of your 

2127
01:43:44,981 --> 01:43:45,814
children,
you help them develop in a manner that 

2128
01:43:47,351 --> 01:43:48,184
makes them eminently desirable to other 
children and capable of interacting 

2129
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:52,250
properly with adults

2130
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:54,020
because then the whole world opens up to
them.

2131
01:43:54,450 --> 01:43:55,283
Now it's a really and then you do that.
The thing that's cool about that too is 

2132
01:43:58,551 --> 01:44:02,510
that this is what makes the postmodern 
and the Marxists types so wrong,

2133
01:44:02,511 --> 01:44:07,250
is that your best strategy for success 
in life isn't the exercise of power.

2134
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:09,320
It's a really counterproductive 
strategy.

2135
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:11,780
Doesn't even work very well for advanced
animals.

2136
01:44:12,110 --> 01:44:14,630
Your best strategy is skill and 
reciprocity,

2137
01:44:17,570 --> 01:44:20,510
so when there's a real high order ethic 
in that that has nothing to do,

2138
01:44:20,511 --> 01:44:21,344
so the idea that our hierarchies are 
predicated on power and they're corrupt 

2139
01:44:23,841 --> 01:44:24,674
because of that,
and the whole world is a battleground 

2140
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:30,910
between hierarchies of different power 
hierarchies and it's winner take all and

2141
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:35,300
you know the devil take the hindmost.
That's just completely inappropriate.

2142
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:40,360
Psychologically.
There's a real situation where you

2143
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:41,623
very rarely find people who excel at 
competition and who have benefited from 

2144
01:44:46,911 --> 01:44:48,920
competition,
who are against competition,

2145
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:50,143
and you very rarely find people who have
no skill in competition at all and who 

2146
01:44:55,281 --> 01:44:57,800
have never engaged in,
have shied away from it their whole life

2147
01:44:57,801 --> 01:45:02,210
that support it and and believe that 
it's an important part of our culture.

2148
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:04,220
I think people want,

2149
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:09,320
they want to believe and they want to 
support things that reinforce their idea

2150
01:45:09,321 --> 01:45:11,820
of how they're living their life 
correctly and if,

2151
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:14,570
if they shy away from competition,
if it makes them nervous,

2152
01:45:14,571 --> 01:45:17,450
if they've never excelled at it,
if it doesn't feel right to them,

2153
01:45:17,451 --> 01:45:20,690
if it makes them uncomfortable,
they want to feel like there some better

2154
01:45:20,691 --> 01:45:23,600
way.
And this is one of the things that leads

2155
01:45:23,601 --> 01:45:25,160
young,
sensitive,

2156
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,593
kind,
compassionate people towards socialism 

2157
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:29,203
and this concept that capitalism and,
and any form of competition at all 

2158
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:33,523
ultimately,
ultimately is going to lead to a few 

2159
01:45:35,541 --> 01:45:38,960
people hogging up all the wealth and 
dominating all the people.

2160
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:41,250
Well,
the other thing that's kind of sad about

2161
01:45:41,251 --> 01:45:45,410
that is that no matter what system you 
set up that outcome,

2162
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:46,743
you know,
like if you look at the prieto 

2163
01:45:48,361 --> 01:45:51,240
distribution,
so if that's the distribution of wealth,

2164
01:45:52,110 --> 01:45:55,440
you'll find that in every society that 
we know of,

2165
01:45:55,441 --> 01:45:58,800
whether it's capitalist or socialist or 
communist for that matter,

2166
01:45:59,070 --> 01:45:59,903
a small proportion of the people have a 
disproportionate amount of the 

2167
01:46:03,241 --> 01:46:04,920
resources.
So.

2168
01:46:05,190 --> 01:46:08,100
So you.
So the other thing that I've been trying

2169
01:46:08,101 --> 01:46:08,934
to explain in my lectures is that if you
were really concerned about the 

2170
01:46:12,121 --> 01:46:12,954
dispossessed and the poor,
you wouldn't put hierarchical 

2171
01:46:15,601 --> 01:46:16,434
dispossession at the feet of capitalism 
because it's a way worse problem than 

2172
01:46:19,741 --> 01:46:20,574
that,
you know,

2173
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,050
because the Marxists types,
they think,

2174
01:46:22,051 --> 01:46:23,670
well,
if we didn't have capitalism,

2175
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:26,460
there wouldn't be hierarchies and there 
wouldn't be dispossession.

2176
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:30,300
And that's complete bloody rubbish 
because the problem of hierarchy and the

2177
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:33,330
problem of dispossession is way deeper 
than the problem of capitalism.

2178
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:37,290
So like if you look at Neolithic grave 
sites way before there was capitalism,

2179
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:40,860
you see that a small number of people 
are buried with all the gold.

2180
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:45,120
So the,
the fact of,

2181
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:50,150
of dis dis unequal distribution of,
that's his oldest,

2182
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:54,960
that's as old as hierarchies are old.
It's unbelievably old.

2183
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:56,213
And so for the leftists to take an 
anticapitalist position and assume that 

2184
01:46:59,401 --> 01:47:00,234
that's going to be a benefit to the 
dispossessed is an idea that's at least 

2185
01:47:03,061 --> 01:47:05,760
145 years out of date as far as I'm 
concerned.

2186
01:47:05,790 --> 01:47:09,720
But we do want to discourage tyranny.
We do want to keep keep that.

2187
01:47:09,721 --> 01:47:10,554
We want to keep someone from 
accumulating so much wealth that they 

2188
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:14,243
dominate the world and have a 
disproportionate effect on culture and 

2189
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:18,893
do things that are detrimental.
That could be in fact detrimental for 

2190
01:47:21,151 --> 01:47:23,460
decades and decades to come.
I mean,

2191
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:24,653
to this day.
Well that's where you have a balance of 

2192
01:47:25,561 --> 01:47:27,900
powers in the United States because.
Yeah.

2193
01:47:27,901 --> 01:47:32,901
Well the thing is it's not the case like
the fact that you can't characterize the

2194
01:47:34,411 --> 01:47:35,244
West as a patriarchal tyranny doesn't 
mean that hierarchies don't become 

2195
01:47:38,131 --> 01:47:38,964
tyrannical.

2196
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:39,923
Sometimes they do and yeah.
And we have to be alert to that and 

2197
01:47:43,051 --> 01:47:43,884
that's been known for a very long time.
So is it fair to say that the West has 

2198
01:47:46,741 --> 01:47:50,730
some aspects of a hierarchy,
hierarchical tyranny?

2199
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:51,820
Of course,
of course.

2200
01:47:51,830 --> 01:47:52,663
And I would say that's a mythological 
true is so like the way that society is 

2201
01:47:58,171 --> 01:48:01,530
represented in our deep narrative 
structures is always twofold.

2202
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:05,580
There's a wise king in a tyrannical king
and they're pitted against each other.

2203
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:10,290
And your job is to amplify the wise king
and keep the tyrant under control.

2204
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,450
That's the evil advisor to the king,
you know,

2205
01:48:12,490 --> 01:48:14,850
like scar in the lion king,
right?

2206
01:48:14,851 --> 01:48:15,684
So there's always this shadowy figure in
the background that's malevolent and 

2207
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:20,034
psychopathic and power obsessed that's 
attempting to take over the hierarchy 

2208
01:48:23,821 --> 01:48:27,900
by,
by ill gotten means that and that that's

2209
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:29,760
evil itself.
In some sense.

2210
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:30,593
It's the archetype of evil.
And so that has to be taken into 

2211
01:48:33,121 --> 01:48:33,954
consideration.
But the problem with the viewpoint 

2212
01:48:36,271 --> 01:48:38,970
that's so prevalent in our society right
now is that nuts,

2213
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:42,210
the patriarchal tyranny viewpoint is 
that it's only the evil king.

2214
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:43,343
And then that's particularly hard on 
young men because if you believe that 

2215
01:48:46,531 --> 01:48:50,040
all of our hierarchies are predicated on
nothing but arbitrary power,

2216
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:53,040
and then that's a natural consequence of
masculinity.

2217
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:56,160
Then whenever you see anyone whose 
masculine manifest,

2218
01:48:56,161 --> 01:48:59,520
anything that's associated with 
competence or confidence or,

2219
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:00,571
or,
or,

2220
01:49:00,571 --> 01:49:03,970
or um,
or let's say competitiveness or,

2221
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:05,580
or you know,
heaven forbid,

2222
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:06,414
aggression,
then you immediately assume that that's 

2223
01:49:07,921 --> 01:49:12,150
nothing but a manifestation of 
tyrannical power and that you discourage

2224
01:49:12,151 --> 01:49:13,020
it or,
or,

2225
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:13,943
or you certainly failed to encourage it.
And I think that that's a dreadful 

2226
01:49:16,981 --> 01:49:19,980
mistake because that,
that masculine energy,

2227
01:49:19,981 --> 01:49:22,440
whether that's characteristic of women 
or men,

2228
01:49:22,441 --> 01:49:24,300
because women can certainly manifest 
that,

2229
01:49:24,510 --> 01:49:25,343
that's something that should be 
integrated and celebrate it and the way 

2230
01:49:28,171 --> 01:49:29,004
you do that,
that's partly why mechanisms like 

2231
01:49:31,291 --> 01:49:35,640
competitive sports are so necessary,
is that you want to take kids,

2232
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:40,110
let's say boys are more competitive and 
aggressive boys just for this example.

2233
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:41,573
You want to take them and you want to 
socialize them intensely so that they 

2234
01:49:44,731 --> 01:49:45,564
take that aggressive,
competitive impulse and they're capable 

2235
01:49:48,131 --> 01:49:48,964
of manifesting it inside a social 
structure like a game so that it's a 

2236
01:49:51,981 --> 01:49:55,200
benefit to everyone and you can do that 
and did it.

2237
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:56,710
It's not a problem.
You know,

2238
01:49:56,711 --> 01:49:57,544
you teach an aggressive kid that it's 
beneath his dignity to bully someone 

2239
01:50:03,431 --> 01:50:06,880
weaker so you can attach that right to 
the competitiveness.

2240
01:50:06,881 --> 01:50:09,760
It's like you're a loser.
You bully someone weaker than you,

2241
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:12,720
you're a loser.
That's pathetic slide.

2242
01:50:12,930 --> 01:50:17,530
It speaks right to that competitive 
drive to want to be a loser.

2243
01:50:17,710 --> 01:50:19,570
Martial arts are so critical.
I mean,

2244
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:21,580
that's one of the major tenants of 
martial arts.

2245
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:22,563
You know,
this is a is a huge part of what's 

2246
01:50:25,211 --> 01:50:30,211
taught in traditional martial arts 
academies as there's a very clear way of

2247
01:50:30,611 --> 01:50:31,444
behaving and you're never supposed to do
anything remotely like bullied and 

2248
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:39,430
you're supposed to have your power.
Exactly.

2249
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:42,220
And you're supposed to have extreme 
reverence for the people who taught.

2250
01:50:42,221 --> 01:50:43,870
You know what I mean?
Your master,

2251
01:50:43,871 --> 01:50:47,950
you literally call them a master in all.
Almost all martial arts,

2252
01:50:47,951 --> 01:50:49,170
they're referred to somebody.

2253
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:51,100
Well,
so that's another thing that's really,

2254
01:50:51,260 --> 01:50:54,990
that's really interesting about a 
functional hierarchy is like because the

2255
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:55,833
leftist critics look at a hierarchy and 
they think every position is up looking 

2256
01:50:59,211 --> 01:51:00,720
down.
Right?

2257
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:01,783
But what you're saying,
what you're pointing out is knowing a 

2258
01:51:03,141 --> 01:51:07,700
functional hierarchy,
there's plenty of respect going up.

2259
01:51:08,090 --> 01:51:09,170
Right?
So it's not only,

2260
01:51:09,171 --> 01:51:11,120
it's not just power,
it's like its power,

2261
01:51:11,121 --> 01:51:11,990
its,
its,

2262
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,810
its authority and subordination.
At the same time,

2263
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:17,720
voluntary subordination,
because you should be,

2264
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:22,400
you should be properly subordinate to 
the people who are better at what you're

2265
01:51:22,401 --> 01:51:23,510
doing.
Yes.

2266
01:51:23,540 --> 01:51:25,940
And in a functional organization that 
happens naturally.

2267
01:51:25,941 --> 01:51:26,774
And the other thing that happens too,
and the radical leftist never take this 

2268
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:30,224
into account as far as I'm concerned,
is that one of the things I've learned 

2269
01:51:32,481 --> 01:51:34,820
about people who've run successful 
organizations,

2270
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:35,893
whether they're academic or business,
is that they really loved mentoring 

2271
01:51:40,851 --> 01:51:41,684
young people.

2272
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:42,673
It's a,
it's an intrinsic pleasure because you 

2273
01:51:44,431 --> 01:51:44,931
know,
you think,

2274
01:51:44,931 --> 01:51:47,000
well,
it's for the evil capitalist,

2275
01:51:47,001 --> 01:51:47,710
it's,
it's,

2276
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:49,250
it's winner take all and,
and,

2277
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:50,093
and to hell with everyone else.
And that's an unbelievably cynical view 

2278
01:51:53,301 --> 01:51:55,970
of human nature.
It only really applies to people who are

2279
01:51:55,971 --> 01:51:58,250
genuinely psychopathic and they're very 
rare.

2280
01:51:58,580 --> 01:51:59,413
And so most of the people I know that 
have been hyper successful are 

2281
01:52:02,931 --> 01:52:03,764
absolutely thrilled if they can find a 
young person and they don't care 

2282
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:09,920
generally speaking about sex or creed or
color or any of that crap.

2283
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:10,933
They care about competence.
They want to find a competent young 

2284
01:52:13,161 --> 01:52:13,994
person who's got a lot of possibility 
and then open up all sorts of doors of 

2285
01:52:17,631 --> 01:52:20,510
opportunity for them and to see how they
can help them develop.

2286
01:52:20,511 --> 01:52:22,460
And if they can do that with 20 or 30 
people,

2287
01:52:22,461 --> 01:52:26,660
then like my graduate,
my graduate supervisor had his,

2288
01:52:26,661 --> 01:52:27,510
uh,
he,

2289
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:30,800
he's getting old and he had his 
retirement party about two years ago and

2290
01:52:30,801 --> 01:52:31,634
about 30 of the people that he trained 
in to becoming scientists came to his 

2291
01:52:34,970 --> 01:52:38,750
party and they talked nonstop about the 
beneficial effect that,

2292
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:41,360
that he had on their life,
you know,

2293
01:52:41,361 --> 01:52:43,070
he found lot of them were,
you know,

2294
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:47,450
they were young and smart but didn't all
that properly oriented in the world.

2295
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:50,720
And he picked them out and gave them 
opportunities and he certainly did.

2296
01:52:50,721 --> 01:52:53,000
This for me,
has opened all sorts of doors for me.

2297
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:55,460
And that was a huge source of pleasure 
in his life.

2298
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:58,130
I think maybe the primary source,
he had a family as well,

2299
01:52:58,131 --> 01:53:00,980
and obviously his family was of primary 
importance,

2300
01:53:00,981 --> 01:53:05,981
but in his professional career,
it wasn't his name on papers in his,

2301
01:53:06,290 --> 01:53:07,000
you know,
his,

2302
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,220
his name in the mark.
Hey,

2303
01:53:08,230 --> 01:53:11,120
it was all these young people whose 
careers he could foster.

2304
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:13,100
It's never ending source of 
satisfaction.

2305
01:53:13,810 --> 01:53:14,643
Yeah.
I think that's a critical aspect of 

2306
01:53:15,671 --> 01:53:18,610
being a successful person,
that you have to realize that a,

2307
01:53:18,690 --> 01:53:19,523
there's a great personal benefit and 
helping other people and that you feel 

2308
01:53:22,961 --> 01:53:23,794
this.
This is not just like something that 

2309
01:53:24,791 --> 01:53:25,624
looks good on paper you when you can 
show some young person who's coming up 

2310
01:53:29,111 --> 01:53:31,990
the way you're 10 years ahead of them 
and you can say,

2311
01:53:31,991 --> 01:53:34,750
these are the mistakes that I made.
I can help you get through this,

2312
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:35,733
and then you see them flourish.
There's a great deal of personal 

2313
01:53:38,171 --> 01:53:39,004
satisfaction infinitely.
There's got to be some sort of an 

2314
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:42,190
evolutionary benefit to this.

2315
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:42,930
Well,
that's.

2316
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:43,860
Well,
that's part of.

2317
01:53:44,070 --> 01:53:44,903
See,
that's the thing is we are evolved for 

2318
01:53:47,011 --> 01:53:50,280
reciprocity really are.
We're not evolved for power,

2319
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:51,213
right?
This is what so deeply wrong about the 

2320
01:53:52,951 --> 01:53:57,090
damn postmodernists in the Marxist is 
that isn't what human first of all.

2321
01:53:57,091 --> 01:54:01,290
Power is not the best strategy to attain
success.

2322
01:54:01,470 --> 01:54:02,303
It's simply not.
It doesn't even work for chimpanzees 

2323
01:54:03,871 --> 01:54:06,840
because the more the brute chimps,
you know,

2324
01:54:06,841 --> 01:54:09,630
the ones that that rule purely as a 
consequence of force,

2325
01:54:09,810 --> 01:54:10,643
as soon as they weaken to subordinates 
that are reciprocally engaged so that 

2326
01:54:14,461 --> 01:54:16,470
have a friendship,
tear them into pieces,

2327
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:17,573
so I don't care how strong you are,
three guys that are like two thirds of 

2328
01:54:20,141 --> 01:54:22,800
your strength,
they're going to take you out so,

2329
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:28,500
so you're much better situated in,
in society and in your life if you,

2330
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:29,873
if you're in an interactive network of 
reciprocally beneficial relationships 

2331
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:35,213
that works in Games,
but it also works in life and to reduce 

2332
01:54:37,741 --> 01:54:39,640
that and,
and if you're competent,

2333
01:54:39,641 --> 01:54:42,000
so there's,
there's the killer combination,

2334
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:42,953
hyper competence and the capacity for 
genuine reciprocity that makes you 

2335
01:54:46,771 --> 01:54:47,560
unstoppable.

2336
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:48,393
Why is there this lack of understanding 
and appreciating this nuance in people 

2337
01:54:52,691 --> 01:54:57,691
that oppose these ideas?
Like what is,

2338
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:04,040
what's the willingness to be ignorant 
about all the variabilities,

2339
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:06,530
especially when you consider the bulk of
the research?

2340
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:07,453
Well,
I think some of it's justification for 

2341
01:55:08,691 --> 01:55:10,220
failure.
You know,

2342
01:55:10,221 --> 01:55:11,054
like if you're not doing very well,
then it's really easy to think that the 

2343
01:55:13,191 --> 01:55:14,024
game is rigged.
It's also easy to be resentful about 

2344
01:55:17,031 --> 01:55:18,950
people who seem to have more than you 
have,

2345
01:55:18,951 --> 01:55:21,110
especially if you're not thinking about 
it very clearly.

2346
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,333
You know,
and that's another thing that I've been 

2347
01:55:23,361 --> 01:55:24,194
trying to lecture to people about is 
that you should be very careful about 

2348
01:55:26,841 --> 01:55:29,060
assuming that someone else has more than
you do.

2349
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:30,313
I mean one of the best predictors of 
whether someone has money is how old 

2350
01:55:33,411 --> 01:55:34,244
they are.
So old people are Richard than young 

2351
01:55:36,351 --> 01:55:38,750
people.
Well obviously right?

2352
01:55:38,751 --> 01:55:40,850
Because they had their whole life to 
accrue wealth.

2353
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:43,680
So like,
well who's got it better?

2354
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:46,650
You want to be rich and older,
young and poor,

2355
01:55:47,790 --> 01:55:52,790
you know,
I mean you can't buy youth with money so

2356
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:55,920
it isn't obvious who's better off in a 
situation like that.

2357
01:55:55,921 --> 01:55:56,754
It's in fact,
I think most people who are old enrich 

2358
01:55:58,771 --> 01:56:01,380
would trade it for young and poor fairly
damn quickly.

2359
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:04,590
Well that's why people really get angry 
when they see young rich people.

2360
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:08,670
I know that's just too much to bear a 
young,

2361
01:56:08,671 --> 01:56:09,470
rich,
famous

2362
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:13,670
rapper.
Like what's that fellow that the 17 year

2363
01:56:13,671 --> 01:56:15,980
old little pump about that

2364
01:56:16,860 --> 01:56:18,740
famous 17.
But you know,

2365
01:56:18,770 --> 01:56:21,480
the folks in high school 17,
the funny thing too though,

2366
01:56:21,481 --> 01:56:22,291
is that,
you know,

2367
01:56:22,291 --> 01:56:24,540
even with people who have that,
that sort of,

2368
01:56:24,690 --> 01:56:27,720
let's call it good fortune,
you know,

2369
01:56:28,410 --> 01:56:29,243
independent of their talent,
you don't have to scratch beneath the 

2370
01:56:32,671 --> 01:56:36,060
surface very far,
even successful people's lives until you

2371
01:56:36,061 --> 01:56:39,470
find it pretty decent vein of tragedy,
you know?

2372
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:41,130
And so it,
it,

2373
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:43,050
that jealousy of,
of,

2374
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:43,973
of the successful is also based on a 
really unit dimensional view of exactly 

2375
01:56:48,511 --> 01:56:50,100
what constitutes success.
You know,

2376
01:56:50,101 --> 01:56:52,950
you see the trappings,
whatever they might be,

2377
01:56:52,951 --> 01:56:55,560
let's say it's a yacht and more money 
than you know,

2378
01:56:55,561 --> 01:56:56,394
what to do with and you assume,
well that's going to put that person at 

2379
01:56:58,561 --> 01:56:59,394
the pinnacle of a satisfying life.
But there's no shortage of dreadfully 

2380
01:57:02,701 --> 01:57:03,534
unhappy and addicted celebrities.
And it isn't obvious always that more 

2381
01:57:07,651 --> 01:57:09,670
money is good for people.
You know?

2382
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:10,470
I mean you say,
oh,

2383
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:12,000
that's a problem I'd like to have.
It's like,

2384
01:57:12,001 --> 01:57:12,834
look,
fair enough.

2385
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:13,673
I mean there are worse problems,
but celebrity and fame and fortune are 

2386
01:57:17,521 --> 01:57:20,880
also not that easy to deal with.
And they come with their own pitfalls.

2387
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:21,743
Plus,
there's lots of things they don't 

2388
01:57:22,681 --> 01:57:24,600
protect you against,
you know,

2389
01:57:24,601 --> 01:57:25,434
people still get divorced and they still
get sick and they still die and their 

2390
01:57:27,841 --> 01:57:29,820
parents still get Alzheimer's and all of
that,

2391
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:30,683
like the,
the fundamental tragic elements of life 

2392
01:57:32,491 --> 01:57:33,540
are still in place.

2393
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:34,963
One of the interesting things about 
people that are jealous of other people 

2394
01:57:36,591 --> 01:57:37,424
that are extremely successful is that 
you are missing one of the core lessons 

2395
01:57:40,910 --> 01:57:41,743
of competition.
One of the core lessons of competition 

2396
01:57:44,751 --> 01:57:45,584
is to be inspired by those who are more 
successful and not to try to chip them 

2397
01:57:48,141 --> 01:57:53,141
down and take away their accomplishments
because they don't make you feel good.

2398
01:57:53,420 --> 01:57:54,650
Yeah.
The people that are pis,

2399
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:55,484
port competition are always the ones 
that are trying to diminish the 

2400
01:57:58,071 --> 01:58:00,200
accomplishments of those who are 
extremely successful.

2401
01:58:00,590 --> 01:58:01,423
You see this in sports fans.
If you see a loser fat sports fan 

2402
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:06,583
talking about what a piece of Shit 
Lebron James is because he dropped the 

2403
01:58:09,741 --> 01:58:10,574
ball or I missed a shot,
this the extreme reaction that they 

2404
01:58:14,841 --> 01:58:15,674
could have to someone who's 
extraordinarily successful is almost 

2405
01:58:19,191 --> 01:58:23,600
always in direct proportion to how much 
of a failure they are in their own life,

2406
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:26,930
and that's one of the reasons why in 
contrast it looks so ridiculous.

2407
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:28,410
Yeah,
well that's part of the danger.

2408
01:58:28,411 --> 01:58:32,460
I would say that's part of the danger of
the entire identity politics movement is

2409
01:58:32,461 --> 01:58:33,294
that you know,
is that that reasonable care for the 

2410
01:58:36,271 --> 01:58:38,160
dispossessed,
which we already talked about,

2411
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:42,040
is easily contaminated by hatred and 
resentment for people are not only

2412
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:42,873
successful,
but who are the most annoying person 

2413
01:58:45,221 --> 01:58:47,410
who's successful is the person who 
deserves it.

2414
01:58:47,411 --> 01:58:48,244
Not the person who doesn't deserve it 
because you can write the person who 

2415
01:58:50,471 --> 01:58:52,420
doesn't deserve it off the lottery 
winner.

2416
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:53,561
You can say,
Oh yeah,

2417
01:58:53,561 --> 01:58:53,951
well,
you know,

2418
01:58:53,951 --> 01:58:55,240
he just got lucky.
Yeah,

2419
01:58:55,241 --> 01:58:57,520
exactly.
But then you see the person who's broken

2420
01:58:57,521 --> 01:58:58,354
themselves in half and you know come out
of a really pathological background and 

2421
01:59:01,311 --> 01:59:03,340
has been successful and you're like,
you're,

2422
01:59:03,341 --> 01:59:07,210
you're uselessly.
I'm wasting your life away.

2423
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:08,073
That's the sort of person that you 
really don't like because they cast you 

2424
01:59:10,361 --> 01:59:11,194
in a very dim light.
So this is where competition is so 

2425
01:59:13,001 --> 01:59:13,834
important because the person that has a 
background and competition has been 

2426
01:59:16,301 --> 01:59:20,800
involved in competition,
sees a person who's busted their ass and

2427
01:59:20,801 --> 01:59:21,634
and become something really 
extraordinary and it's incredibly 

2428
01:59:24,821 --> 01:59:25,654
inspirational and you look to those 
people and you want to read their 

2429
01:59:28,451 --> 01:59:29,284
biographies and you want to watch 
documentaries on them because it 

2430
01:59:31,361 --> 01:59:32,560
literally gives you fuel.

2431
01:59:32,890 --> 01:59:33,723
Whereas the person who shies away from 
competition is afraid of their own 

2432
01:59:36,941 --> 01:59:40,210
insecurities and failures and really has
never tested themselves.

2433
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:41,223
Those are the ones that find these 
people extremely distasteful because 

2434
01:59:44,141 --> 01:59:48,160
when they put themselves in comparison 
to these incredible people,

2435
01:59:48,161 --> 01:59:49,500
they they come up short.
I will.

2436
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:52,450
Every ideal experiences,
every ideal is a judge.

2437
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:53,590
Yes.
So what's,

2438
01:59:53,620 --> 01:59:55,930
what's the answer to that?
No ideals.

2439
01:59:56,270 --> 01:59:58,510
That's a stupid.
That's a stupid suggestion.

2440
01:59:58,511 --> 01:59:59,344
No,
it certainly doesn't because then it 

2441
01:59:59,981 --> 02:00:01,840
leaves people without any meaning in 
their life.

2442
02:00:02,250 --> 02:00:03,520
No,
so well,

2443
02:00:03,521 --> 02:00:05,440
I think it speaks to what you were 
talking about earlier,

2444
02:00:05,441 --> 02:00:07,780
that we needed diversity,
that we needed adversity,

2445
02:00:07,781 --> 02:00:09,220
we need difficulty,
we need struggle.

2446
02:00:09,221 --> 02:00:10,870
You need,
you need a weight to carry,

2447
02:00:11,530 --> 02:00:14,650
and if you don't have any of this,
you do not get your character tested.

2448
02:00:14,810 --> 02:00:15,643
You do not advance in your own 
perception of who you are in this world 

2449
02:00:19,391 --> 02:00:21,820
and how you,
how you engage with all the other people

2450
02:00:21,821 --> 02:00:22,260
around you.

2451
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:26,380
You don't call out what's best in you 
and then you can't live without that.

2452
02:00:26,410 --> 02:00:28,000
You need that.
You need that.

2453
02:00:28,001 --> 02:00:31,180
And so,
and the trick seems to be that voluntary

2454
02:00:31,181 --> 02:00:32,710
acceptance of the adversity.
See,

2455
02:00:32,711 --> 02:00:33,544
that's one of the things that I think is
core to the mythos of Christianity 

2456
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:41,020
because there's an idea that you should 
pick up your cross and stumble up hill.

2457
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:43,000
And that's really what that means is 
that,

2458
02:00:43,070 --> 02:00:44,100
you know,
you set your,

2459
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:47,500
you set your eyes on some high level 
vision,

2460
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:50,380
the city of God on the hill,
whatever that happens to be,

2461
02:00:50,381 --> 02:00:53,140
you know,
and then you take the burden,

2462
02:00:53,290 --> 02:00:55,390
whatever burden you're capable of 
lifting,

2463
02:00:55,391 --> 02:00:58,510
which is obviously going to be a burden 
of suffering at least to some degree.

2464
02:00:58,511 --> 02:01:01,230
And you carry that voluntarily.
That's the trick is that.

2465
02:01:01,530 --> 02:01:02,351
And then you say,
well,

2466
02:01:02,351 --> 02:01:03,580
you need a purpose in your life.

2467
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:04,271
It's like,
well look,

2468
02:01:04,271 --> 02:01:06,130
there's a lot of problems around you in 
the world.

2469
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:09,580
You have some problems,
some problems even that bother you.

2470
02:01:09,581 --> 02:01:10,391
Right?
Personally,

2471
02:01:10,391 --> 02:01:12,250
they seem to call out to you those 
problems.

2472
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:15,700
Maybe those are your problems.
Those are the problems you should solve.

2473
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:17,950
And those I think are the call to 
adventure.

2474
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,750
So like there's a problem.
It bugs me.

2475
02:01:19,751 --> 02:01:23,080
Okay,
do something about that is your problem.

2476
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:25,360
There's a certain amount that you could 
tolerate.

2477
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:27,400
I mean,
I think it's like weight training.

2478
02:01:27,730 --> 02:01:29,650
There's a certain amount where it 
becomes detrimental.

2479
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:32,200
Where you've overtrained your body's 
breaking down.

2480
02:01:32,201 --> 02:01:33,034
There's a certain amount of problems 
that you have in your life that are 

2481
02:01:34,751 --> 02:01:39,440
extremely beneficial because through 
going through these problems,

2482
02:01:39,441 --> 02:01:40,274
sorting them out,

2483
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:41,990
you,
you build your spirit,

2484
02:01:41,991 --> 02:01:42,824
you,
you build your character and if you 

2485
02:01:44,121 --> 02:01:47,660
don't accomplish anything and you never 
encounter any problems,

2486
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:48,703
you are this gelatinous soft,
atrophied soul and you don't have the 

2487
02:01:53,451 --> 02:01:55,930
intestinal fortitude or the spirit or 
the.

2488
02:01:56,050 --> 02:01:56,883
The human potential has not been 
developed to the point where you can 

2489
02:01:59,601 --> 02:02:02,210
overcome adversity.
The only way to overcome adversities,

2490
02:02:02,211 --> 02:02:03,080
to face it so

2491
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:05,840
that that optimism that you were talking
about.

2492
02:02:05,841 --> 02:02:10,090
So I've really been interested in 
neurophysiology of the.

2493
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:13,960
Of the sense of meaning because 
neurophysiology.

2494
02:02:14,050 --> 02:02:15,560
Yeah,
because of the meat,

2495
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:17,930
meaning the feeling of meaning is an 
instinct.

2496
02:02:18,290 --> 02:02:19,123
It's not a thought.
It's not a secondary consequence of 

2497
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:23,780
rational processes.
It's way deeper than that.

2498
02:02:23,781 --> 02:02:26,000
It's something that drives rationality 
itself.

2499
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:28,490
So now you were just very amongst 
people.

2500
02:02:28,491 --> 02:02:29,324
Definitely,
but it varies in this way as far as I 

2501
02:02:31,221 --> 02:02:32,240
can tell.
So that.

2502
02:02:32,241 --> 02:02:36,290
So imagine as you said that there's an 
optimal load,

2503
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:37,393
right?
You exceed that and to your detriment 

2504
02:02:39,210 --> 02:02:41,300
and you see that in the weight room.
You pull a muscle,

2505
02:02:41,301 --> 02:02:42,590
you hurt your,
you'll hurt yourself.

2506
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:44,600
You can injure yourself very badly,
right?

2507
02:02:44,601 --> 02:02:47,480
You can take yourself out for the count 
button.

2508
02:02:47,481 --> 02:02:48,314
Then if you,
if you work too little while then there 

2509
02:02:49,751 --> 02:02:50,810
is no gain in it.

2510
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:56,110
You have to find that thin edge where 
you're competent in what you're doing,

2511
02:02:56,871 --> 02:03:00,050
but you're pushing yourself.
That's going to be where meaning lies.

2512
02:03:00,650 --> 02:03:01,483
That's what meaning tells people.
It says you're on the edge where you're 

2513
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:05,533
competent and and out of undue danger,
but pushing yourself enough so that 

2514
02:03:10,491 --> 02:03:11,324
you're continually developing.
That's the instinct of meaning and that 

2515
02:03:13,761 --> 02:03:14,594
looks to me like it's a consequence of 
the interaction between the right and 

2516
02:03:16,771 --> 02:03:17,604
the left hemispheres and the 
consequences of the interaction between 

2517
02:03:20,121 --> 02:03:24,170
the negative emotion systems,
anxiety and pain that regulate you,

2518
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:27,530
that protect you from harm and the 
exploratory in place.

2519
02:03:27,531 --> 02:03:30,920
Systems that drive you forward.
You want the exploratory in place,

2520
02:03:30,921 --> 02:03:31,754
systems to drive you forward,
but then they're regulated by these 

2521
02:03:34,431 --> 02:03:36,200
negative emotions so you don't hurt 
yourself,

2522
02:03:36,201 --> 02:03:39,080
and if you get that optimally right,
then that's the maximal.

2523
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:40,093
That's the point of maximal challenge 
and that makes you really alert because 

2524
02:03:42,641 --> 02:03:44,270
your positive emotion is functioning.

2525
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:45,253
That's what's driving you forward.
This is worth doing and your negative 

2526
02:03:48,111 --> 02:03:49,730
emotions are alert to saying,
yeah,

2527
02:03:49,731 --> 02:03:53,240
but be awake and be careful and you know
what that's like in the weight room.

2528
02:03:53,241 --> 02:03:54,074
If you're lifting something that's at 
the edge of your ability and you've got 

2529
02:03:56,511 --> 02:03:59,480
a spotter,
you want a push and you can barely do it

2530
02:03:59,481 --> 02:04:02,720
and you want to make sure that you're 
not going to like pull your arm down and

2531
02:04:02,721 --> 02:04:04,990
rip the hell out of your muscle,
but you.

2532
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:08,690
You're right on that edge and now it's 
the place of maximal gain and that sense

2533
02:04:08,691 --> 02:04:09,524
of meaning.
That's what puts you on the border 

2534
02:04:10,581 --> 02:04:12,500
between chaos and order,
right?

2535
02:04:12,501 --> 02:04:13,334
Because too much order means you're just
practicing what you already know and 

2536
02:04:16,311 --> 02:04:21,260
then you then you stultify and stagnate 
and too much chaos means you better look

2537
02:04:21,261 --> 02:04:22,430
out because you're going to hurt 
yourself.

2538
02:04:22,430 --> 02:04:24,080
You're pushing yourself beyond your 
limits.

2539
02:04:24,380 --> 02:04:28,280
You stay right on that edge.
That's where there's maximum meaning and

2540
02:04:28,290 --> 02:04:31,550
you're wired for that edges.
Push it to push it.

2541
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:32,391
Yeah.
Well,

2542
02:04:32,391 --> 02:04:34,100
one of the things I recommend to young 
people,

2543
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:36,200
especially true for people in their 
twenties,

2544
02:04:36,201 --> 02:04:37,034
is that you should push yourself beyond 
your limits of tolerance in your 

2545
02:04:40,171 --> 02:04:43,620
twenties to find out where it is,
how much can you work,

2546
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:45,540
how disciplined can you become?
Like,

2547
02:04:45,541 --> 02:04:48,120
can you work 12 hours a day?
Can you work eight hours a day?

2548
02:04:48,121 --> 02:04:52,830
Can you work three hours a day like flat
out where's your limit and how much,

2549
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:56,220
how much work can you do and how much 
socialization you should find out.

2550
02:04:56,640 --> 02:04:57,473
Push yourself past and then back off to 
to that point where it's optimally 

2551
02:05:00,601 --> 02:05:02,310
sustainable.
That's what a lot of people do,

2552
02:05:02,311 --> 02:05:03,031
isn't it?
I mean,

2553
02:05:03,031 --> 02:05:04,650
they party too much when they're in 
their twenties.

2554
02:05:04,650 --> 02:05:06,100
They make a lot of mistakes.
It's,

2555
02:05:06,150 --> 02:05:06,983
it's,
it's what they're doing and I would say 

2556
02:05:08,041 --> 02:05:09,840
in sort of a haphazard way,
right?

2557
02:05:09,841 --> 02:05:12,840
Because there's that instinct to go out 
there and do more,

2558
02:05:13,330 --> 02:05:14,163
but it's unregulated and it's not.
It's not as self conscious as it might 

2559
02:05:18,061 --> 02:05:19,650
be.
It's good to know that there's,

2560
02:05:19,890 --> 02:05:23,520
it's good to think about that as a goal.
It's like you're trying to discover what

2561
02:05:23,521 --> 02:05:26,310
your limitations are when you're,
when you're in your twenties so that you

2562
02:05:26,311 --> 02:05:30,180
can hit that edge so that you can 
sustain yourself across the decades.

2563
02:05:30,570 --> 02:05:31,700
And so yeah,
because you don't,

2564
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:33,660
you don't want to.
You don't want to have too much fun,

2565
02:05:34,830 --> 02:05:35,663
too much fun takes you out.
You don't want to be the oldest guy at 

2566
02:05:37,831 --> 02:05:39,240
the disco,
you know?

2567
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:40,103
It's not,
it's not fun being the 40 year old at 

2568
02:05:41,491 --> 02:05:42,324
the singles bar.
Precisely so you want to make sure that 

2569
02:05:45,481 --> 02:05:46,314
what you're doing is age appropriate and
you want to push yourself in every 

2570
02:05:48,421 --> 02:05:49,254
direction that you can,
but you shouldn't be doing that with an 

2571
02:05:50,421 --> 02:05:51,080
aim in mind.

2572
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:51,913
It's like you're trying to make yourself
into a better and more competent person 

2573
02:05:54,450 --> 02:05:57,570
and so some discipline along with the 
fund is a good idea,

2574
02:05:58,110 --> 02:06:00,450
so to take care of yourself and the 
people around you.

2575
02:06:00,451 --> 02:06:01,284
That's one of the things I recommended 
to people and I've had quite a few 

2576
02:06:04,381 --> 02:06:06,780
people actually tell me that they've 
done this.

2577
02:06:06,781 --> 02:06:07,950
Interestingly enough.
I said,

2578
02:06:07,951 --> 02:06:08,784
well,
one thing you could aim at if you had 

2579
02:06:09,601 --> 02:06:10,434
any sense when you were young is to be 
the most worth you could be the most 

2580
02:06:13,921 --> 02:06:15,840
reliable person at your father's 
funeral.

2581
02:06:17,670 --> 02:06:18,503
And so I think that's a good challenge.
And I had a bunch of people come up to 

2582
02:06:20,551 --> 02:06:22,920
me in this last tour and tell me that 
that's exactly what they did.

2583
02:06:22,921 --> 02:06:24,300
These were often young guys,
you know,

2584
02:06:24,301 --> 02:06:28,680
like before 20 said my dad died suddenly
or died after years,

2585
02:06:28,710 --> 02:06:31,260
illness and it was just taken me out and
no wonder,

2586
02:06:31,261 --> 02:06:32,370
you know,
he said,

2587
02:06:32,371 --> 02:06:33,870
they said,
I was listening to your lectures.

2588
02:06:33,870 --> 02:06:34,703
You said you want to be the most 
reliable person at the funeral because 

2589
02:06:36,811 --> 02:06:39,410
everyone else is grieving and what the 
hell else are you going to do?

2590
02:06:39,430 --> 02:06:41,670
He said that's what they tried to do and
not gotten through it,

2591
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:43,223
so now that's part of that.
Picking up that load as far as I'm 

2592
02:06:46,381 --> 02:06:47,214
concerned,
you get a little self respect out of 

2593
02:06:48,661 --> 02:06:50,130
that two and a real sense,
right?

2594
02:06:50,131 --> 02:06:50,964
Because you know you're this sort of sad
suffering creature that's capable of a 

2595
02:06:54,091 --> 02:06:58,320
fair bit of malevolence,
but if you find out that you can carry a

2596
02:06:58,321 --> 02:06:59,154
heavy load and take care of yourself and
have a little leftover for some other 

2597
02:07:01,891 --> 02:07:02,724
people,
then you can wake up at three in the 

2598
02:07:03,631 --> 02:07:04,770
morning and think,
well man,

2599
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:05,760
I could be worse

2600
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:06,713
and this is not a political perspective.
This is a positive constructive way of 

2601
02:07:10,141 --> 02:07:10,974
looking at how to navigate the world.
But when you break down the sort of 

2602
02:07:16,831 --> 02:07:17,664
behavior types,
whether it's the people that generally 

2603
02:07:19,801 --> 02:07:20,634
support socialism or socialist ideas or 
their anti-competition versus people 

2604
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:29,940
that are pro pushing yourself.
They fall into these right wing,

2605
02:07:29,941 --> 02:07:34,941
left wing sort of paradigms and this 
really weird way that especially there.

2606
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:36,250
I think that's especially

2607
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:37,083
true on the radical ends.
But I think you get that on the radical 

2608
02:07:38,981 --> 02:07:40,840
right too.
Because you should have people who are,

2609
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:43,660
who are collectivists in their 
fundamental orientation,

2610
02:07:43,661 --> 02:07:44,494
you know,
and they're,

2611
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:45,353
they're trying to take undue credit for 
who their racial ancestors were or 

2612
02:07:49,230 --> 02:07:50,063
there.
Okay.

2613
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:51,033
What,
what I would say with the political 

2614
02:07:52,841 --> 02:07:56,020
issue is that I think that you can build
decent,

2615
02:07:56,021 --> 02:07:59,350
responsible people who are on the 
middle,

2616
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:01,600
right of the spectrum and the middle 
left,

2617
02:08:01,601 --> 02:08:02,434
you know,
because I think that you can have left 

2618
02:08:03,971 --> 02:08:04,804
wing political beliefs that are 
genuinely aimed at aid to the 

2619
02:08:08,561 --> 02:08:09,394
dispossessed without being resentful of 
the hierarchies and without 

2620
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:15,430
contaminating it with jealousy for the 
successful.

2621
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:17,100
It's hard,
right?

2622
02:08:17,170 --> 02:08:20,320
You have.
Because when I worked for the NDP when I

2623
02:08:20,321 --> 02:08:21,154
was a kid,
wouldn't.

2624
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:24,220
That was the Socialist Party in Canada.
The leaders,

2625
02:08:24,221 --> 02:08:25,840
some of the leaders were people like 
that,

2626
02:08:26,660 --> 02:08:29,410
like a lot of the low level party 
functionary types.

2627
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:31,540
They were the activist types that you 
still see today.

2628
02:08:31,541 --> 02:08:33,580
And there are mostly resentful.
I didn't like them at all,

2629
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:38,200
but some of the leaders were genuinely 
genuine advocates for the working class,

2630
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:39,760
you know,
and they,

2631
02:08:39,940 --> 02:08:41,530
they had their flaws obviously,
but,

2632
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:42,813
but there,
they put their money where their mouth 

2633
02:08:44,351 --> 02:08:45,184
was and they were trying to ensure that 
the hierarchies we're open to 

2634
02:08:48,341 --> 02:08:49,550
advancement for,
for,

2635
02:08:49,580 --> 02:08:51,280
for let's say,
the common person,

2636
02:08:51,281 --> 02:08:52,114
so to speak,
the person who stopped up at the bottom 

2637
02:08:53,470 --> 02:08:55,810
or for their children,
which might even be more important,

2638
02:08:55,980 --> 02:08:56,813
you know,
so that the hierarchy's remain open to 

2639
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:00,183
genuine competency based on competence,
which would be a perfectly reasonable 

2640
02:09:04,061 --> 02:09:06,010
thing for the left.
Who insist on right is that,

2641
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:07,133
let's bloody well make sure that it's a 
fair game and so that people don't get 

2642
02:09:10,631 --> 02:09:14,470
locked out of movement forward because 
of arbitrary positions of power.

2643
02:09:14,830 --> 02:09:15,770
And that's,
that's,

2644
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:16,653
that's a reasonable,
that's a reasonable part of the 

2645
02:09:19,121 --> 02:09:21,670
discussion.
So I think if you build better people,

2646
02:09:21,671 --> 02:09:22,504
you can build better people on the left 
and on the right and people that be 

2647
02:09:24,570 --> 02:09:25,403
good.
I appreciate that rules to the game or 

2648
02:09:26,861 --> 02:09:27,694
better for everyone.
They're better for the people that when 

2649
02:09:29,021 --> 02:09:30,430
they're better for the people that are 
coming up,

2650
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:31,473
they're better for us if that's a real 
structure in real rules and that you're 

2651
02:09:35,321 --> 02:09:37,210
better off being a guy like Wayne 
Gretzky.

2652
02:09:37,270 --> 02:09:39,480
Yes,
better off being a guy who's respected,

2653
02:09:39,481 --> 02:09:40,314
uh,
plays the game correctly and just does 

2654
02:09:41,561 --> 02:09:42,394
his best and really,
truly become the champion and loved by 

2655
02:09:43,901 --> 02:09:45,820
all because of it.
You're better off in every way.

2656
02:09:46,110 --> 02:09:47,210
Right?
And that's the most state.

2657
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:48,700
The other thing that's so cool about 
that.

2658
02:09:48,701 --> 02:09:51,540
So imagine this,
this is the antidote tomorrow.

2659
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:52,990
Relativism.
Okay.

2660
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:57,880
So the first thing is,
is that there are real problems and,

2661
02:09:57,950 --> 02:10:02,440
and hierarchical organizations can offer
real solutions socially and personally,

2662
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:05,560
so you can confront the problems 
courageously and you can solve.

2663
02:10:05,770 --> 02:10:09,430
So that's real and ameliorate suffering 
and limits malevolence.

2664
02:10:09,431 --> 02:10:11,440
And so there's nothing morally relative 
about that.

2665
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:14,650
The second is that sense of meaning that
we discussed.

2666
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:19,060
That's not some philosophical second 
order consequences of thinking.

2667
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:20,043
It's way deeper than that.
That sense of meaning tells you when 

2668
02:10:23,321 --> 02:10:26,350
you're the God ski.
The Russian psychologist called that the

2669
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:27,184
zone of proximal development,
which I believe is where the phrase the 

2670
02:10:29,411 --> 02:10:32,740
zone came from and so in the zone of 
proximal development,

2671
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,010
this is what adults do

2672
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:36,230
with children,
little kids that are learning to talk.

2673
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:37,393
Adults automatically talk to little 
children who are learning to talk at a 

2674
02:10:40,101 --> 02:10:43,460
level that slightly exceeds their 
current vocabulary.

2675
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:47,240
They do that without even knowing it and
that puts those kids in the zone,

2676
02:10:47,241 --> 02:10:48,500
right?
Because if you just talk baby,

2677
02:10:48,501 --> 02:10:49,334
talk to kids,
then all they learned is baby talk and 

2678
02:10:50,901 --> 02:10:54,200
if you just talk like an adult and they 
don't understand a word you're saying,

2679
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:58,940
so you'll find this happy medium in 
between where the kid mostly understands

2680
02:10:58,941 --> 02:11:02,120
what you're talking about and that 
you're pulling them forward so that puts

2681
02:11:02,121 --> 02:11:02,954
them in the zone.
Now it's a meaningful zone and so you 

2682
02:11:05,661 --> 02:11:08,600
can feel the operation of that zone in 
your own life.

2683
02:11:08,601 --> 02:11:10,820
That's what the Taoists are on a boat 
because they say,

2684
02:11:10,821 --> 02:11:12,230
well,
the Dow is the way.

2685
02:11:12,231 --> 02:11:14,150
Right?
And that's the pathway between chaos and

2686
02:11:14,151 --> 02:11:14,600
order.

2687
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:15,433
That's meaning and you can feel that in 
your life when you're deeply engaged in 

2688
02:11:18,621 --> 02:11:21,110
something like we have deeply engaged in
conversations,

2689
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:23,390
okay,
which is part of the reason that we keep

2690
02:11:23,391 --> 02:11:24,224
having them and I think why they're 
popular and we're not paying attention 

2691
02:11:26,601 --> 02:11:27,434
to how the clock is ticking or how time 
is flowing or even to the fact that 

2692
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:30,793
we're doing what we're doing.
We're just having a conversation and 

2693
02:11:32,781 --> 02:11:34,400
it's meaningful.
It's engaged,

2694
02:11:34,401 --> 02:11:36,590
it keeps our eyes focused and our 
senses.

2695
02:11:36,950 --> 02:11:37,783
I'm concentrated on what's happening and
the reason for that is that there's 

2696
02:11:41,691 --> 02:11:45,590
enough information flowing between us so
that we're being slightly transformed as

2697
02:11:45,591 --> 02:11:47,630
a consequence of the discussion.
Right?

2698
02:11:47,631 --> 02:11:50,540
So we're both comfortable.
We trust each other.

2699
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:54,530
We trust that the conversation is aimed 
at something that's a mutual benefit.

2700
02:11:54,950 --> 02:11:55,783
We trust each other to tell the truth to
the to the degree that we're capable of 

2701
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:00,344
doing that.

2702
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:01,273
And then when you engage in this 
exchange of information and to the 

2703
02:12:03,741 --> 02:12:04,574
degree that it's breaking you down a 
little bit and building you up in a 

2704
02:12:07,761 --> 02:12:10,460
different way,
that's a little death and rebirth.

2705
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:13,820
There's constant little deaths and 
rebirths in a meaningful conversation.

2706
02:12:14,090 --> 02:12:14,923
Then that keeps you alive and 
functioning and that that focus is like 

2707
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:20,093
that that speaks to you so deeply that 
that focus happens without any 

2708
02:12:23,211 --> 02:12:27,260
consciousness and that's meaning and 
that's that line between chaos and order

2709
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:29,090
and that's real.
That has nothing.

2710
02:12:29,091 --> 02:12:29,850
It's,
it's,

2711
02:12:29,850 --> 02:12:31,490
it's,
and I would say,

2712
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:35,030
here's another thing that's cool,
so that line between chaos and order,

2713
02:12:35,780 --> 02:12:38,720
that's the same thing that's happening 
when you're playing a game property,

2714
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:41,490
right?
Because you're in the game and you're.

2715
02:12:41,570 --> 02:12:44,120
You're exercising your skill,
but you're pushing it,

2716
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:45,313
but you're pushing it in a way that's 
also a benefit to your teammates and to 

2717
02:12:47,661 --> 02:12:51,500
the progression of the game as such and 
to being a better general player.

2718
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:52,333
You're doing all that at the same time 
and you're evolved with enough natural 

2719
02:12:56,901 --> 02:13:01,760
intelligence so that the sum,
total output of your nervous system says

2720
02:13:01,761 --> 02:13:02,594
to you,
you're in the right place at the right 

2721
02:13:03,891 --> 02:13:04,724
time doing the right thing,
and that's what makes your life 

2722
02:13:06,621 --> 02:13:08,150
meaningful,
and that's real.

2723
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:10,310
I then I think it's more real than 
anything else.

2724
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:11,383
I think it's more real than suffering.
I think it's more real than malevolence 

2725
02:13:13,881 --> 02:13:17,720
because it's the antidote to both of 
those and so the whole moral,

2726
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:20,770
moral relativism issue for me is a 
nonstarter.

2727
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,900
It's just wrong.
There's lots of ways of interpreting the

2728
02:13:23,901 --> 02:13:24,734
world,
but there aren't very many ways of 

2729
02:13:25,461 --> 02:13:29,330
interpreting it optimally and you can 
feel when you're doing that,

2730
02:13:29,390 --> 02:13:32,010
it makes you stronger.
And then people that come to me

2731
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:33,300
after my talks and say,
well,

2732
02:13:33,301 --> 02:13:34,710
you know,
I'd be putting my life together.

2733
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:37,950
I've developed a vision.
I've been trying to be more responsible.

2734
02:13:37,951 --> 02:13:40,620
I've been trying to be more honest and 
put my relationships together.

2735
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:41,573
They're all sparkly eyes because of this
or crying sometimes because it's really 

2736
02:13:44,671 --> 02:13:47,700
had an impact on them at a deep level.
They think,

2737
02:13:47,701 --> 02:13:49,110
Oh wow,
this actually works.

2738
02:13:49,111 --> 02:13:49,711
It's like,
yeah,

2739
02:13:49,711 --> 02:13:51,240
it actually works.
It's real.

2740
02:13:51,450 --> 02:13:52,283
It's real.
And I would say as well that that's 

2741
02:13:54,211 --> 02:13:57,750
associated with the idea of the deep 
western idea of the logos,

2742
02:13:57,751 --> 02:14:01,280
which is meaning in action and speech.
So you know,

2743
02:14:01,290 --> 02:14:03,570
if we have a conversation that's 
meaningful,

2744
02:14:04,290 --> 02:14:08,250
then that's a manifestation of the 
spirit of the logos and that's the thing

2745
02:14:08,251 --> 02:14:10,070
that destroys.
And,

2746
02:14:10,260 --> 02:14:11,093
and,
and recreates at the same time because 

2747
02:14:14,461 --> 02:14:16,230
you learn something,
destroy something,

2748
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:17,093
destroys a little presupposition that 
you had that was erroneous and replaces 

2749
02:14:19,861 --> 02:14:20,694
it with something that's healthier and 
every time you have a meaningful 

2750
02:14:22,921 --> 02:14:24,180
conversation that happens.

2751
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:26,460
It's like a little tweak now.
It wasn't quite right here.

2752
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:29,220
Kick that moves and something new takes 
its place.

2753
02:14:29,550 --> 02:14:30,383
So in,
that's a little death and rebirth 

2754
02:14:31,291 --> 02:14:32,124
instead of the catastrophic death and 
rebirth that you might have to have if 

2755
02:14:35,251 --> 02:14:38,790
you weren't paying attention.
So that's all tied together.

2756
02:14:38,791 --> 02:14:40,800
It's all tied together with that 
phenomenon of meaning.

2757
02:14:40,801 --> 02:14:43,230
And that's the same as the adoption of 
responsibility.

2758
02:14:43,410 --> 02:14:47,880
That all ties together so nicely.
The other concept of meaning,

2759
02:14:47,970 --> 02:14:50,280
like what is important,
that it's so,

2760
02:14:50,330 --> 02:14:51,163
it's so huge to people but so fleeting.
It's so difficult to like what is 

2761
02:14:54,631 --> 02:14:55,201
meaning?
Well,

2762
02:14:55,201 --> 02:14:56,340
you know,
there's a simple one,

2763
02:14:56,341 --> 02:14:57,174
so I like family and loved ones and 
companionship and community and finding 

2764
02:15:01,651 --> 02:15:05,010
something that you enjoy doing that you 
can do that.

2765
02:15:05,011 --> 02:15:07,260
It seems bigger than you or bigger than 
yourself but,

2766
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:10,980
but meaning like the meaning of life,
what is meaning?

2767
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:15,030
And it's one of the things that gives 
people so much existential anxiety and I

2768
02:15:15,031 --> 02:15:19,560
think is the cause of a lot of despair.
Because while you can question it,

2769
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:20,453
yes,
but the thing is is that that's one of 

2770
02:15:22,411 --> 02:15:27,411
the dangers of rationality is that see 
the Egyptians associated,

2771
02:15:27,661 --> 02:15:29,550
the Catholics did this to some degree 
too.

2772
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:30,653
They associated rationality,
rationality with a proclivity to 

2773
02:15:33,871 --> 02:15:37,140
malevolence,
partly because rationality tends to fall

2774
02:15:37,141 --> 02:15:37,974
in love with its own productions.
Intelligence has this like inbuilt 

2775
02:15:40,141 --> 02:15:44,880
arrogance and the Egyptians in 
particular were really insightful.

2776
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:46,073
They tried to replace the idea of 
intelligence as the highest virtue with 

2777
02:15:49,171 --> 02:15:50,004
the idea of attention as the highest 
virtue because something Elvis Huxley 

2778
02:15:52,621 --> 02:15:55,530
knew,
he wrote a book called Island Island was

2779
02:15:55,531 --> 02:15:58,770
an island that was populated by head.
A lot of birds on it and the birds could

2780
02:15:58,771 --> 02:16:01,920
talk and all they did was say,
pay attention to remind everybody on the

2781
02:16:01,921 --> 02:16:05,050
island to pay attention all the time.
But you,

2782
02:16:05,130 --> 02:16:08,160
you can undermine your sense of meaning 
and you can question it.

2783
02:16:08,190 --> 02:16:09,023
But the best thing to do is to actually 
pay attention to when it manifests 

2784
02:16:12,061 --> 02:16:13,480
itself.
Because it's a.

2785
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:18,720
it's a phenomenon like like color or 
like or like love or like beauty,

2786
02:16:18,721 --> 02:16:19,860
it,
it exists.

2787
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:20,993
It isn't something you created,
something that you discover and you can 

2788
02:16:23,551 --> 02:16:24,384
discover it.
You just have to watch it like you're 

2789
02:16:26,461 --> 02:16:27,840
ignorant about yourself.
You think,

2790
02:16:27,841 --> 02:16:28,820
okay,
well I'm gonna I,

2791
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:29,870
I,
I've taught,

2792
02:16:29,940 --> 02:16:30,130
told

2793
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:31,960
my clinical clients to do this,
and my students was,

2794
02:16:32,110 --> 02:16:34,600
watch yourself for two weeks.
Just watch,

2795
02:16:34,601 --> 02:16:35,434
like you don't know who you are and 
notice when you're doing something that 

2796
02:16:38,261 --> 02:16:40,600
you're engaged in,
so like you'll see it.

2797
02:16:40,601 --> 02:16:43,330
Maybe it's only 10 minutes because your 
life is pretty out of balance,

2798
02:16:43,331 --> 02:16:44,164
but you'll see that whole man,
I was engaged in something there for 10 

2799
02:16:46,121 --> 02:16:47,050
minutes.
It's like,

2800
02:16:47,051 --> 02:16:48,340
why?
What was,

2801
02:16:48,341 --> 02:16:50,410
what did you do that was right that 
engaged you?

2802
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:53,260
You were in the right place at the right
time,

2803
02:16:53,350 --> 02:16:56,140
doing the right thing for a few minutes.
What was it?

2804
02:16:56,170 --> 02:17:00,640
What were the preconditions?
There's this line in the new testament.

2805
02:17:00,850 --> 02:17:01,683
Christ says,
the Kingdom of God is spread across the 

2806
02:17:03,431 --> 02:17:06,070
earth,
but men do not see it and that's what it

2807
02:17:06,071 --> 02:17:06,904
refers to is that you.
You Wander into paradise now and then 

2808
02:17:10,750 --> 02:17:11,583
when you're engaged,
when you're deeply engaged in something 

2809
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:15,610
but you don't notice it,
you don't think,

2810
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:16,473
oh look,
I'm in the right place and everything's 

2811
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:18,513
working out right now.
It means I've got it right somehow and 

2812
02:17:20,921 --> 02:17:23,950
then I need to practice being there more
and more and more,

2813
02:17:23,980 --> 02:17:24,813
which is while that's the appropriate 
thing to try to practice and that's to 

2814
02:17:28,961 --> 02:17:32,500
make that,
to come to some negotiated,

2815
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:34,750
what would you call it?
It's it.

2816
02:17:34,770 --> 02:17:35,603
It's to come to a negotiation with that 
intrinsic sense of meaning and to 

2817
02:17:38,321 --> 02:17:39,154
realize it as a fact rather than just as
an opinion or or something that's 

2818
02:17:43,091 --> 02:17:44,520
secondary because it's annoying

2819
02:17:44,610 --> 02:17:45,443
concept for people though would be so 
aware of who they are and what they're 

2820
02:17:47,941 --> 02:17:51,300
doing.
They could recreate that so when they do

2821
02:17:51,301 --> 02:17:52,134
feel that feeling of meaning that they 
could figure out a way to get back into 

2822
02:17:54,601 --> 02:17:58,180
that state and what were all the 
extenuating circumstances and where,

2823
02:17:58,190 --> 02:18:00,500
where's my head at?
What caused me to have this,

2824
02:18:00,670 --> 02:18:02,250
this feeling like things were right?

2825
02:18:02,300 --> 02:18:02,841
Yes.
Well,

2826
02:18:02,841 --> 02:18:04,550
it's like someone gives you a gift and 
you think,

2827
02:18:04,551 --> 02:18:05,660
well,
I'd like that gift again.

2828
02:18:05,661 --> 02:18:06,171
It's like,
yeah,

2829
02:18:06,171 --> 02:18:09,110
well you have to figure out what it was 
that you did to deserve it,

2830
02:18:09,111 --> 02:18:10,500
so to speak,
and yeah,

2831
02:18:10,501 --> 02:18:12,680
no,
it requires a fair bit of.

2832
02:18:12,860 --> 02:18:15,320
It requires a fair bit of careful 
reflection,

2833
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:17,960
but it also requires that ignorance is 
you have to think,

2834
02:18:17,961 --> 02:18:19,040
well,
I don't know who I am.

2835
02:18:19,850 --> 02:18:21,410
I'm going to find some things 
meaningful.

2836
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:22,273
What are they?
They might not even be things you want 

2837
02:18:23,691 --> 02:18:25,760
to find meaningful.
They might be things that you might even

2838
02:18:25,761 --> 02:18:27,370
be ashamed of,
you know,

2839
02:18:27,380 --> 02:18:28,213
because sometimes people are interested 
in things that they don't think that 

2840
02:18:31,461 --> 02:18:33,290
they should be interested in.
Like maybe you'll,

2841
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:34,710
you'll,
you'll have a guy who was,

2842
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:36,840
who was kind of a cliche,
but who was,

2843
02:18:37,870 --> 02:18:38,703
you know,
socialized to be real tough guy and he 

2844
02:18:40,251 --> 02:18:43,520
finds out that he's kind of interested 
in art or aesthetics.

2845
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:44,001
It's like,
well,

2846
02:18:44,001 --> 02:18:47,000
he's shamed that because maybe it's too 
feminine or whatever.

2847
02:18:47,790 --> 02:18:48,623
Well,
it's doesn't matter because that's 

2848
02:18:49,521 --> 02:18:50,354
actually speaking that that's actually 
something that's speaking to him from 

2849
02:18:52,971 --> 02:18:56,300
the core of his genuine being.
He's gonna have to pursue that,

2850
02:18:56,420 --> 02:18:57,253
or you might find that someone who's 
really agreeable and kind of a pushover 

2851
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:03,313
stands up to someone just once at work 
says what they really think and then 

2852
02:19:07,761 --> 02:19:08,960
they realized afterwards,
wow,

2853
02:19:08,961 --> 02:19:10,730
you know,
that was exactly right,

2854
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:12,170
and they think,
oh my God,

2855
02:19:12,171 --> 02:19:14,060
you know,
I've decided when I was a little kid,

2856
02:19:14,061 --> 02:19:16,370
maybe they had a harsh father and they 
decided when they were four,

2857
02:19:16,460 --> 02:19:18,140
I've never going to be angry in my whole
life.

2858
02:19:18,260 --> 02:19:19,093
There's something wrong with aggression,
so they've gone out of their way their 

2859
02:19:21,321 --> 02:19:22,154
whole life to be free of conflict.
Then they find out the one day they 

2860
02:19:25,311 --> 02:19:26,144
stand up for themselves that that whole 
that they'd parsed off as inappropriate 

2861
02:19:29,841 --> 02:19:32,780
is actually contains exactly what they 
need to put themselves together.

2862
02:19:33,370 --> 02:19:35,720
Or do you find what you need where you 
least want to look?

2863
02:19:36,380 --> 02:19:39,730
That's the old chemical dictum in sterk,
wiliness infinite tour.

2864
02:19:39,770 --> 02:19:40,230
Right?

2865
02:19:40,230 --> 02:19:41,063
I want to talk to you about activists 
because it's something that you brought 

2866
02:19:44,471 --> 02:19:46,680
up earlier saying that you,
you know,

2867
02:19:46,710 --> 02:19:47,543
you find them appealing.
I want to know what you think the 

2868
02:19:51,161 --> 02:19:56,161
motivation of a lot of these 
particularly radical left wing activists

2869
02:19:56,500 --> 02:20:01,500
that want to shut down lectures and 
screen people down in these auditoriums.

2870
02:20:02,320 --> 02:20:06,160
What do you think the motivation of 
these people is and what do you.

2871
02:20:06,180 --> 02:20:07,540
What do you think is the root of it?

2872
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:12,140
Well,
I think that it's a quick route to moral

2873
02:20:12,141 --> 02:20:14,270
virtue.
You know,

2874
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:15,113
like it's actually really hard to put 
yourself together and you have to do 

2875
02:20:18,291 --> 02:20:21,160
that in ways that you can't trump it,
you know,

2876
02:20:21,170 --> 02:20:25,370
because most of the things that are 
wrong with you are kind of low.

2877
02:20:26,180 --> 02:20:29,720
What would you call it?
Second rate and embarrassing your all,

2878
02:20:29,721 --> 02:20:30,554
your stupid little habits and your 
proclivity to procrastinate and all the 

2879
02:20:32,961 --> 02:20:33,794
things that you're minorly ashamed of 
and then you have to work on those 

2880
02:20:36,321 --> 02:20:37,154
slowly because the probability that 
you're going to be able to fix them 

2881
02:20:39,891 --> 02:20:40,724
quickly is low and you can't really brag
about it because it's so embarrassing 

2882
02:20:45,181 --> 02:20:46,970
just to admit that they exist to begin 
with it.

2883
02:20:46,971 --> 02:20:47,804
You can hardly brag about it and it sort
of painstaking private work and you 

2884
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:53,233
don't get a lot of social,
you don't get a lot of quick social 

2885
02:20:55,191 --> 02:20:57,290
status for it.
It's effortful,

2886
02:20:57,470 --> 02:21:00,200
embarrassing,
humbling and difficult,

2887
02:21:00,590 --> 02:21:01,423
and then you can do something like be an
activist and you get all that public 

2888
02:21:05,301 --> 02:21:09,620
acclaim for being on the good side with 
no effort whatsoever.

2889
02:21:10,270 --> 02:21:12,720
And so it's a loss.
Do you think that

2890
02:21:12,940 --> 02:21:16,090
any motivation at all to try to make the
world a better place?

2891
02:21:16,091 --> 02:21:19,030
Yes,
I think that's part of it.

2892
02:21:19,031 --> 02:21:19,601
Sure.
Well,

2893
02:21:19,601 --> 02:21:24,601
I think it's flavored by this desire to 
broadcast your virtue.

2894
02:21:26,010 --> 02:21:26,843
Yes.
Because it's very difficult to make the 

2895
02:21:27,841 --> 02:21:29,520
world a better place.
You know?

2896
02:21:29,670 --> 02:21:30,503
That's the thing is no,
I mean young people have a messianic 

2897
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:36,330
impulse.
That's another thing that was documented

2898
02:21:36,331 --> 02:21:38,750
by piaget that there's a stage,
you know,

2899
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:41,740
in late adolescence where you want to 
make the world a better place.

2900
02:21:42,030 --> 02:21:45,630
I would say that's probably part of the 
impulse to,

2901
02:21:46,150 --> 02:21:46,983
you know,
establish a permanent relationship and 

2902
02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:51,750
have a family and take care of people,
you know,

2903
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:54,390
and to take on some of the burden of 
life.

2904
02:21:54,630 --> 02:21:55,463
It's the psychological precursor to that
and it's reasonable for smart young 

2905
02:22:00,361 --> 02:22:01,194
people to be concerned about broader 
philosophical issues if they tilt in 

2906
02:22:05,161 --> 02:22:05,994
that direction as well.
But it's all too easy for that to be 

2907
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:15,200
pathologized into resentment for,
for those who seem to have more unfairly

2908
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:21,360
and also to take the easy route out and 
there aren't easy routes.

2909
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:26,010
There are only difficult routes to doing
useful things and it's better just to

2910
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,390
do that.
And then.

2911
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:32,010
So I think that there's some impulse to,
you know,

2912
02:22:32,011 --> 02:22:32,844
there's some wish that things could be 
less unfair and that fewer people could 

2913
02:22:36,451 --> 02:22:37,284
suffer,
but it's kind of a low level virtue 

2914
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:41,670
that,
that reflects of compassion.

2915
02:22:42,810 --> 02:22:43,550
You know,
I,

2916
02:22:43,550 --> 02:22:45,990
I'm not saying it's,
it's without merit because it's the,

2917
02:22:46,340 --> 02:22:49,100
that compassion is the basis for the 
ability to take care of,

2918
02:22:49,490 --> 02:22:52,590
of people who are ill and and infants 
and so forth.

2919
02:22:52,610 --> 02:22:55,050
This low level like where's that?
It's not thought through.

2920
02:22:56,190 --> 02:22:58,470
Things are complicated.
It's hard to.

2921
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:03,030
It's hard to make complicated systems 
work better and it's really easy to make

2922
02:23:03,031 --> 02:23:03,864
them work worse.
What about activists that want to shut 

2923
02:23:06,031 --> 02:23:08,520
down certain speakers?
Like someone who's,

2924
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:13,980
in my opinion,
a fairly innocuous in terms of the net.

2925
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:16,110
Here's one,
Christina Hoff summers.

2926
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:18,750
I just don't see a good argument for 
shutting her down.

2927
02:23:18,750 --> 02:23:20,970
She's so polite.
She's a feminist.

2928
02:23:21,090 --> 02:23:25,790
She's well read.
She's a really nice person and Janice is

2929
02:23:25,910 --> 02:23:27,210
like that too.
In the Canada.

2930
02:23:27,350 --> 02:23:31,290
It sort of person doesn't make sense 
that people would shout her down.

2931
02:23:31,291 --> 02:23:34,470
Yet they do say horrible things about 
her.

2932
02:23:34,471 --> 02:23:35,304
They mischaracterize her in a really 
brutal way that it completely 

2933
02:23:40,741 --> 02:23:44,120
invalidates their argument or their 
opposition to her,

2934
02:23:44,121 --> 02:23:46,710
to anyone is paying attention to what 
she said.

2935
02:23:46,770 --> 02:23:47,161
Oh,
well,

2936
02:23:47,161 --> 02:23:48,840
a lot.
A lot of it is.

2937
02:23:48,900 --> 02:23:51,390
A lot of it is also just immature acting
out.

2938
02:23:51,470 --> 02:23:52,303
Yes.
There's an arrogance tolerated and I 

2939
02:23:55,080 --> 02:23:57,960
very strange way it is.
It is.

2940
02:23:57,990 --> 02:23:58,823
It is.
Well,

2941
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:00,360
yeah,
it's,

2942
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:03,390
it's,
it's part of our doubt,

2943
02:24:03,391 --> 02:24:04,224
I suppose about authority on a boat.
It's and our willingness to assume that 

2944
02:24:08,191 --> 02:24:11,100
all authority is contaminated by power.
It's like it's shunned.

2945
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:13,700
Heckling too.
It's almost like you have,

2946
02:24:13,710 --> 02:24:14,543
you're doing a play or a musical or 
you're singing a song and someone just 

2947
02:24:17,521 --> 02:24:20,160
decided to start screaming out,
well that person's an asshole.

2948
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:22,410
But if you're espousing and opinion,
Yep,

2949
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:24,690
and that person decides to scream out 
and they,

2950
02:24:24,691 --> 02:24:25,524
they do.
So under the guise of moral virtue on 

2951
02:24:28,400 --> 02:24:31,080
tolerated,
undeserved access to power.

2952
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:32,460
Yes.
You know,

2953
02:24:32,461 --> 02:24:36,660
and it's no wonder that radical leftists
in particular concentrate on power.

2954
02:24:36,750 --> 02:24:40,410
Everything's about power.
Well then it's okay if they use power as

2955
02:24:40,411 --> 02:24:42,420
part of their means of expression.
It's like,

2956
02:24:42,421 --> 02:24:44,430
well,
you're just playing power games.

2957
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:45,533
It's perfectly reasonable even 
appropriate for me to play power games 

2958
02:24:47,911 --> 02:24:50,100
because you know,
I'm oppressed compared to you.

2959
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:51,173
If everything's power,
then everybody gets to yell and there's 

2960
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:55,950
no.
One of the things I realized about about

2961
02:24:56,080 --> 02:25:01,080
recently as well is that there isn't a 
debate about free speech.

2962
02:25:01,350 --> 02:25:03,390
Exactly not the way that we think about 
it,

2963
02:25:03,640 --> 02:25:06,420
you know,
because there's the classical defense of

2964
02:25:06,421 --> 02:25:07,254
free speech,
so the classical defense of free 

2965
02:25:08,761 --> 02:25:09,594
speeches that it's better for both of us
if we're able to exchange our opinions 

2966
02:25:14,101 --> 02:25:18,210
because I have the opportunity to learn 
from you and you have the opportunity to

2967
02:25:18,211 --> 02:25:19,044
learn from me and you have the 
opportunity to learn from your own 

2968
02:25:21,601 --> 02:25:24,170
mistakes and social feedback and so do

2969
02:25:24,170 --> 02:25:28,060
I and negotiation beats war.
Okay,

2970
02:25:28,061 --> 02:25:28,894
so that's kind of the classical now,
but that's predicated on some 

2971
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:36,370
assumptions and those are.
You're an autonomous being.

2972
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:37,593
You're capable of formulating an opinion
that that's actually unique to you and 

2973
02:25:41,111 --> 02:25:41,944
that in dialogue we can mutually modify 
each other's unique opinions in a way 

2974
02:25:46,751 --> 02:25:50,050
that produces a mutually harmonious and 
beneficial outcome.

2975
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:52,150
That's all the predicate.
Well,

2976
02:25:52,570 --> 02:25:54,730
the people who are opposed to free 
speech,

2977
02:25:54,731 --> 02:25:55,564
you see,
it's not that they're trying to shut 

2978
02:25:57,341 --> 02:25:59,730
down people whose opinions are different
than theirs.

2979
02:25:59,740 --> 02:26:00,573
Exactly.
It's that they're opposed to the idea 

2980
02:26:02,951 --> 02:26:07,951
that free speech exists.
It's a way deeper problem because at the

2981
02:26:08,291 --> 02:26:11,890
bottom of the postmodernist mess is the 
following assumption is that,

2982
02:26:12,250 --> 02:26:14,050
well,
there's no.

2983
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:20,130
There's no one way of interacting with 
the world that's preferable to any other

2984
02:26:20,231 --> 02:26:24,910
way and so what people do is organize 
themselves into hierarchies of power and

2985
02:26:24,911 --> 02:26:25,744
then struggle for dominance within the 
hierarchies and then the hierarchy 

2986
02:26:28,211 --> 02:26:29,440
struggled between each other.

2987
02:26:29,650 --> 02:26:32,200
So it's a landscape of worrying 
hierarchies.

2988
02:26:32,201 --> 02:26:33,034
That's all it is and you think that 
you're a person and that you have an 

2989
02:26:36,191 --> 02:26:37,024
opinion but you're not.
You're just the mouthpiece of your 

2990
02:26:40,750 --> 02:26:45,750
privileged hierarchy and so am I and so 
and it's incommensurate.

2991
02:26:45,910 --> 02:26:46,743
If we're from different hierarchies,
there isn't a you talking to me that 

2992
02:26:49,841 --> 02:26:50,674
could come to an agreement.
There's just you acting as a mouthpiece 

2993
02:26:52,931 --> 02:26:57,100
for your power and me acting as a 
mouthpiece for my power and so since I'm

2994
02:26:57,101 --> 02:27:00,130
part of my group and I want to win 
because it's all about power,

2995
02:27:00,280 --> 02:27:02,380
then why the hell would I ever want you 
to talk?

2996
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:03,573
It's not like I have anything to learn 
from you or even that learning is 

2997
02:27:05,441 --> 02:27:08,620
possible,
or even that there are two people having

2998
02:27:08,621 --> 02:27:09,454
a discussion.
There's nothing but the mouthpiece of 

2999
02:27:12,670 --> 02:27:16,180
power.
There's two mouthpieces of power warring

3000
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:18,160
and so why should I listen to you?

3001
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:20,320
I'll just shut you down because then I 
went,

3002
02:27:21,330 --> 02:27:22,163
so this,
this free speech debate isn't about 

3003
02:27:24,750 --> 02:27:25,583
whose,
whose opinion should be allowed within 

3004
02:27:28,790 --> 02:27:32,590
an overarching framework where free 
speeches is a real thing.

3005
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:36,670
It's a debate about whether there such a
thing as free speech at all.

3006
02:27:36,950 --> 02:27:40,270
The radical postmodernist types.
They denied even that.

3007
02:27:40,271 --> 02:27:42,940
There's such a thing as an autonomous 
individual in any way.

3008
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:44,223
You're just.
You're just the nexus of economic 

3009
02:27:46,241 --> 02:27:48,430
forces,
economic and social forces.

3010
02:27:48,610 --> 02:27:51,850
You're entirely socially constructed.
There's no you.

3011
02:27:52,690 --> 02:27:53,523
These are deep criticisms like I've.
I've made this case before that the 

3012
02:27:56,771 --> 02:27:57,604
postmodern types,
although they have to ally themselves 

3013
02:27:59,981 --> 02:28:02,650
with the Marxist for for reasons that we
don't have to go into,

3014
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:05,800
they are going after things that are so 
fundamental.

3015
02:28:05,801 --> 02:28:07,570
You can't believe it.
They don't.

3016
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:11,650
There is no autonomous individual in the
postmodern world.

3017
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:13,473
That's,
that's a modern Western enlightenment 

3018
02:28:14,891 --> 02:28:15,370
viewpoint.

3019
02:28:15,370 --> 02:28:16,203
That's or a Christian viewpoint or a 
Judeo Christian viewpoint or maybe an 

3020
02:28:19,391 --> 02:28:23,180
abrahamic religion viewpoint.
Who the hell knows it might be that that

3021
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:27,020
deep.
You're the nexus of sociological forces.

3022
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:28,033
There's no integrated self.
You don't have ideas or opinions and 

3023
02:28:31,551 --> 02:28:35,030
there's no dialogue between us that 
doesn't exist.

3024
02:28:35,230 --> 02:28:37,730
There's your group,
your identity,

3025
02:28:37,850 --> 02:28:41,120
your struggle for power,
and that's all this is.

3026
02:28:41,121 --> 02:28:41,954
Your interpretation of this is.
This is the fundamental essence of 

3027
02:28:46,491 --> 02:28:48,290
postmodernism.
Especially.

3028
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:53,270
It's especially true in the format 
espoused by Derrida and foucault for Co.

3029
02:28:53,271 --> 02:28:55,790
Everything's about power.
Everything is about power,

3030
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:57,043
and dara dara was definitely.
That's why he criticized the idea of 

3031
02:28:59,241 --> 02:29:00,074
logo centrism.
Logos is that ability of the individual 

3032
02:29:03,501 --> 02:29:08,270
to engage in dialogue.
Route for dialogue is logos or logic.

3033
02:29:08,420 --> 02:29:10,700
That's all criticized.
That's all gone.

3034
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:13,280
The identity politics players,
the serious,

3035
02:29:13,350 --> 02:29:15,560
the people who are serious about this 
philosophically,

3036
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:19,970
they don't believe in the idea of the 
autonomous individual that's gone,

3037
02:29:21,430 --> 02:29:23,440
so it's not like they're playing a game 
within,

3038
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:24,311
you know,
you think,

3039
02:29:24,311 --> 02:29:25,240
well,
this is a game.

3040
02:29:26,230 --> 02:29:27,063
WE're all playing a game where we agree 
on some things and we're just 

3041
02:29:29,411 --> 02:29:31,030
disagreeing about the details.
It's like,

3042
02:29:31,031 --> 02:29:31,930
oh no,
no,

3043
02:29:31,931 --> 02:29:32,700
no,
no,

3044
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:35,920
you don't want to make that mistake.
This critique is way,

3045
02:29:35,921 --> 02:29:36,754
way deeper than that,
which is why derrida was opposed to the 

3046
02:29:40,331 --> 02:29:41,164
idea of logo centrism.
He didn't believe in the idea of an 

3047
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:44,273
autonomous individual that didn't exist.
That's just a fiction set up by those 

3048
02:29:48,730 --> 02:29:49,563
who have used the idea of the autonomous
individual to advance their power 

3049
02:29:53,981 --> 02:29:58,060
maneuvering within the confines of the 
colonialist.

3050
02:29:59,140 --> 02:30:00,310
The colonialists west.

3051
02:30:00,590 --> 02:30:01,423
No,
and what's the rationalization for that 

3052
02:30:02,551 --> 02:30:06,190
perspective?
Is this to enhance their argument to try

3053
02:30:06,191 --> 02:30:06,580
to,
to,

3054
02:30:06,580 --> 02:30:11,580
to push forth their ideas in less,
less debatable way.

3055
02:30:12,210 --> 02:30:13,043
Like what?

3056
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:15,460
I think the motivation is hatred for 
competence,

3057
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:18,610
hatred for competence.
I truly believe that I've been trying to

3058
02:30:18,611 --> 02:30:22,110
do down like go down as deep as I could 
to find out why the layers of the.

3059
02:30:22,111 --> 02:30:24,160
I think it's cain and abel.
Wow.

3060
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:25,113
I really believe that.
I think that because I can't understand 

3061
02:30:27,731 --> 02:30:29,110
the motivation.
Otherwise it's like,

3062
02:30:29,111 --> 02:30:29,944
well,
why are you tearing these things down 

3063
02:30:30,941 --> 02:30:32,300
while it's on the base?
You know,

3064
02:30:32,650 --> 02:30:34,750
we have sympathy for the oppressed.
It's like,

3065
02:30:34,751 --> 02:30:36,850
well,
well why?

3066
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:40,030
Like wearing,
you're wearing your conceptualization.

3067
02:30:40,480 --> 02:30:42,850
does that iDea of sympathy for the 
oppressed come from.

3068
02:30:42,851 --> 02:30:45,850
You don't even have the iDea of the 
individual in your conceptualization.

3069
02:30:46,420 --> 02:30:50,490
It's like that's just a.
I don't,

3070
02:30:50,491 --> 02:30:52,110
I don't.
I don't buy any of that.

3071
02:30:52,170 --> 02:30:54,870
I think it's cain and abel row all the 
way down.

3072
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:55,833
Do you think that when you're talking 
about the scandinavian model where 

3073
02:30:58,721 --> 02:31:03,721
they've made it incredibly equal and 
through this massive effort to take away

3074
02:31:09,460 --> 02:31:10,293
any opportunity or to to to rather open 
up every possible opportunity for women 

3075
02:31:14,440 --> 02:31:16,420
that men also have and you've seen 
these,

3076
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:20,160
these differences in genders actually 
accentuate because of this.

3077
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:25,760
Do you Think that maybe what we're 
seeing also,

3078
02:31:25,891 --> 02:31:30,660
even in terms of the postmodernists and 
the radical leftist versus people in the

3079
02:31:30,661 --> 02:31:31,494
right,
this same sort of competition aspect of 

3080
02:31:33,451 --> 02:31:34,284
it is also problematic because it's one 
of the reasons why there's so much 

3081
02:31:38,610 --> 02:31:40,830
debate in the first place and that if 
we.

3082
02:31:41,310 --> 02:31:46,140
If we had maybe more middle ground and 
more opportunity,

3083
02:31:46,141 --> 02:31:46,974
there would be less of an argument.
There would be less of a reason to have 

3084
02:31:50,911 --> 02:31:52,500
these,
these,

3085
02:31:52,580 --> 02:31:53,413
these extreme polar opposites that may 
be embracing of more like there's 

3086
02:31:58,021 --> 02:32:02,490
certain socialist aspects of our society
that we just accept.

3087
02:32:02,490 --> 02:32:04,140
Right?
Like the fire department,

3088
02:32:04,470 --> 02:32:05,303
right?
Yeah,

3089
02:32:05,310 --> 02:32:07,920
like universal provision of 
infrastructure.

3090
02:32:07,950 --> 02:32:08,441
Yes.
Yeah,

3091
02:32:08,441 --> 02:32:11,250
that's a good one.
It's schools should be,

3092
02:32:11,251 --> 02:32:13,290
I think more emphasized in that 
direction,

3093
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:14,273
but it it gears towards privatized 
schools for people with higher incomes 

3094
02:32:19,980 --> 02:32:24,980
which gets away more from socialism and 
sort of reinforces capitalist more.

3095
02:32:25,261 --> 02:32:26,094
Right,
but I think things like maybe perhaps 

3096
02:32:28,261 --> 02:32:32,020
even universal basic income or certainly
universal health care with you,

3097
02:32:32,220 --> 02:32:34,410
what you guys have in Canada,
which we don't have here,

3098
02:32:34,590 --> 02:32:39,590
and definitely a higher education making
higher education,

3099
02:32:39,931 --> 02:32:44,390
far more accessible and far less costly.
Stop subsidizing these student Loans.

3100
02:32:44,391 --> 02:32:46,740
Stop making student loan.
something that you can never ask.

3101
02:32:46,820 --> 02:32:47,653
Well,
I think this is part of the eternal 

3102
02:32:48,651 --> 02:32:49,371
debate,
right?

3103
02:32:49,371 --> 02:32:53,690
Because we've already talked about the 
utility of hierarchies and the necessity

3104
02:32:53,691 --> 02:32:57,530
of putting those who can in charge,
but the consequence of that,

3105
02:32:57,531 --> 02:33:00,920
which is an unequal distribution of both
talent and resources.

3106
02:33:01,190 --> 02:33:03,440
Well,
you don't want that to get so steep that

3107
02:33:03,441 --> 02:33:06,830
people stack up at the bottom because 
you're all society starts to destabilize

3108
02:33:06,831 --> 02:33:07,664
and so you have to have a continual 
discussion between the left and the 

3109
02:33:09,861 --> 02:33:14,150
right to see how you stop the bottom 
from suffering.

3110
02:33:14,190 --> 02:33:15,023
Yeah,
from hitting zero because zero is not 

3111
02:33:16,881 --> 02:33:17,714
good.
You can't play when you hit zero and 

3112
02:33:19,161 --> 02:33:19,994
that's not good,
and so I don't think there is a 

3113
02:33:22,730 --> 02:33:23,563
universal solution to that problem 
because the problem keeps manifesting 

3114
02:33:27,480 --> 02:33:28,313
itself.
Think about a death and eternal problem 

3115
02:33:29,510 --> 02:33:30,440
here.
Here's the problem.

3116
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:33,950
There's a set of problems that'll never 
go away.

3117
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:34,873
Now what the problems are change,
but the fact that there are problems 

3118
02:33:37,911 --> 02:33:39,170
never go away.
Okay?

3119
02:33:39,980 --> 02:33:40,813
The fact that you have to produce 
hierarchies to solve those problems 

3120
02:33:42,891 --> 02:33:46,790
never goes away.
The fact that the hierarchy's dispossess

3121
02:33:46,850 --> 02:33:51,440
never goes away,
but the detail shift all the time and so

3122
02:33:51,590 --> 02:33:52,423
the whole reason that you need the 
political discussion is to take a look 

3123
02:33:55,161 --> 02:33:59,150
at the particulars of the hierarchies 
and the particulars of the dispossession

3124
02:33:59,151 --> 02:33:59,661
and say,
okay,

3125
02:33:59,661 --> 02:34:00,494
well now we need to shim it up here and 
now we need to shim it up here and now 

3126
02:34:03,351 --> 02:34:07,310
we need to adjust this and now we need 
to adjust this because you can't come up

3127
02:34:07,311 --> 02:34:08,144
with a final solution to those problems.
I think that's partly why you have 

3128
02:34:11,031 --> 02:34:13,170
consciousness itself,
you know,

3129
02:34:13,190 --> 02:34:16,010
because if you could automate the 
solution,

3130
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:16,913
imagine there was a permanent,
well there's a permanent solution to 

3131
02:34:19,331 --> 02:34:20,164
breathing.

3132
02:34:20,590 --> 02:34:22,420
You have a paRt of your brain that just 
breathes.

3133
02:34:23,050 --> 02:34:23,883
You don't think about it.
You don't adjust it while you do a bit 

3134
02:34:25,331 --> 02:34:27,190
when you're talking,
but you get my point.

3135
02:34:27,191 --> 02:34:30,400
It's like problem taken care of.
Well,

3136
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:33,100
there's other problems that are so 
fluid,

3137
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:34,173
like they're eternal problems,
but they're so fluid in their detail 

3138
02:34:35,981 --> 02:34:39,730
that you need awareness and linguistic 
capacity to address them.

3139
02:34:40,060 --> 02:34:40,893
And I would say the problem of hierarchy
and dispossession fit exactly into that 

3140
02:34:44,891 --> 02:34:45,724
category is that we're going to organize
ourselves hierarchically because talent 

3141
02:34:49,781 --> 02:34:52,750
is unequally distributed.
It doesn't matter.

3142
02:34:52,751 --> 02:34:53,584
Like as soon as you invent basketball 
and instantly you know there's one 

3143
02:34:56,321 --> 02:34:59,200
percent of the population who are super 
great at basketball.

3144
02:35:00,700 --> 02:35:03,250
it doesn't matter.
As soon as you set up an arbitrary value

3145
02:35:03,251 --> 02:35:04,390
structure,
you get hierarchy,

3146
02:35:05,020 --> 02:35:05,853
then there's the whole schlubs at the 
bottom that can put a ball in the hoop 

3147
02:35:09,611 --> 02:35:10,600
to save their lives.

3148
02:35:11,140 --> 02:35:13,630
And,
and That's an eternal problem.

3149
02:35:13,870 --> 02:35:14,703
That's why it says in the new testament 
that the poor will be with us always a 

3150
02:35:17,171 --> 02:35:20,500
very pessimistic if there's two lines 
like that.

3151
02:35:20,501 --> 02:35:23,920
One is to those who have everything more
will be given.

3152
02:35:23,921 --> 02:35:25,930
And from those who have nothing,
everything will be taken.

3153
02:35:26,470 --> 02:35:27,303
That's a rough line.
And the second is the poor will be with 

3154
02:35:29,411 --> 02:35:30,910
us always.
Okay?

3155
02:35:30,911 --> 02:35:31,930
So why?
Well,

3156
02:35:31,931 --> 02:35:32,764
it's a reflection of what we just 
described is that you're going to get 

3157
02:35:35,441 --> 02:35:38,140
hierarchical structures in.
They're going to dispossess okay?

3158
02:35:38,141 --> 02:35:40,720
So then what we want to do is we want to
use mercy.

3159
02:35:41,170 --> 02:35:46,000
Say justice gives you what you deserve,
so that's on the competitive end.

3160
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:47,193
You get what you deserve,
but there's this old idea in old 

3161
02:35:49,121 --> 02:35:50,710
religious idea.
This is a good idea.

3162
02:35:51,490 --> 02:35:52,323
God rules with two hands,
right hand is justice in the left hand 

3163
02:35:55,571 --> 02:35:56,404
is mercy.

3164
02:35:56,530 --> 02:35:57,363
Justice means you get what you deserve,
but the world can't survive that way 

3165
02:36:00,431 --> 02:36:02,980
because people are flawed and make 
mistakes.

3166
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:05,680
And if you only got exactly what you 
deserved,

3167
02:36:05,890 --> 02:36:07,600
it would be a hell of a world,
right?

3168
02:36:07,601 --> 02:36:10,090
Because you'd be punished for every 
single mistake you make.

3169
02:36:10,330 --> 02:36:11,163
You know,
you be held accountable in a way that 

3170
02:36:12,161 --> 02:36:12,994
would be unbearable.
So that has to be tempered with mercy 

3171
02:36:16,440 --> 02:36:17,273
and and so maybe the left is the is the 
end of the distribution that tempers 

3172
02:36:21,551 --> 02:36:23,920
with mercy when,
when it's functioning properly,

3173
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:28,750
but it can degenerate into that came 
like resentment of the,

3174
02:36:29,080 --> 02:36:29,913
of the successful.
And that's a danger on the right you 

3175
02:36:33,311 --> 02:36:35,760
have the opposite danger which is well,
you know,

3176
02:36:35,761 --> 02:36:39,700
you advance because of your competence,
but then that can also fly.

3177
02:36:39,701 --> 02:36:42,130
And so you want to hang onto that,
that position,

3178
02:36:42,131 --> 02:36:44,860
even though your know your competence no
longer justifies it,

3179
02:36:45,100 --> 02:36:50,100
you start to use the advantages of your 
position to accrue benefits for yourself

3180
02:36:50,411 --> 02:36:53,740
that you did not earn,
and that's the proclivity of the,

3181
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:56,740
of the hierarchy to become blind and 
tyrannical.

3182
02:36:56,860 --> 02:36:58,720
And that's a.
That's an eternal problem.

3183
02:36:58,721 --> 02:36:59,400
The,
the,

3184
02:36:59,400 --> 02:37:01,150
the egyptians had a garden for that.
Oh,

3185
02:37:01,151 --> 02:37:02,550
cyrus.
Oh,

3186
02:37:02,551 --> 02:37:05,620
cyrus was the god of hierarchies and he 
was always threatened by seth,

3187
02:37:05,650 --> 02:37:10,210
who is evil brother in his evil brother 
was always conspiring to overcome him.

3188
02:37:10,211 --> 02:37:11,044
And that's the problem with hierarchies 
is that they tilt towards tyranny and 

3189
02:37:14,050 --> 02:37:16,440
the reasonable says that watch

3190
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:18,380
the hierarchies because they tilt 
towards tyranny.

3191
02:37:18,410 --> 02:37:19,243
It's like,
yes,

3192
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:20,593
it's true,
but that doesn't mean that the idea of 

3193
02:37:24,081 --> 02:37:24,914
hierarchy itself is flawed.
And that doesn't mean that all 

3194
02:37:28,191 --> 02:37:31,070
hierarchies are tyrannical.
That's going way too far.

3195
02:37:31,140 --> 02:37:31,973
Do you think that the scandinavian model
that has revealed that when you do make 

3196
02:37:36,931 --> 02:37:40,470
things more equal,
you will find that people generally tend

3197
02:37:40,471 --> 02:37:45,471
to gravitate more towards traditional 
gender roles that does this.

3198
02:37:46,830 --> 02:37:49,140
Do you think that this makes people 
happier?

3199
02:37:49,230 --> 02:37:53,160
Has it been observed that this is a 
happier results?

3200
02:37:53,880 --> 02:37:54,713
That's a good question.
The indices of life satisfaction are 

3201
02:37:58,401 --> 02:37:59,234
pretty high in scandinavia,
but I don't know if anybody has done an 

3202
02:38:02,361 --> 02:38:05,060
analysis that would indicate whether 
the,

3203
02:38:05,490 --> 02:38:09,920
the sexual sorting is a contributor to 
that.

3204
02:38:10,460 --> 02:38:11,570
Oh,
that's a good question.

3205
02:38:11,780 --> 02:38:12,613
I mean the general idea has been that 
the scandinavians are happier because 

3206
02:38:16,881 --> 02:38:19,820
their societies are more egalitarian,
but,

3207
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:20,833
but they're not more egalitarian in the 
sense that men and women are also more 

3208
02:38:25,071 --> 02:38:28,970
different.
So men and women are more different,

3209
02:38:28,971 --> 02:38:31,340
but the opportunities are more 
egalitarian.

3210
02:38:31,341 --> 02:38:32,121
Yeah.
Yeah.

3211
02:38:32,121 --> 02:38:32,990
So,
but so then,

3212
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,600
but then the societies are more,
are more satisfied,

3213
02:38:35,720 --> 02:38:36,553
but it's tough because there's other 
variables because the scandinavian 

3214
02:38:38,571 --> 02:38:41,750
countries are relatively homogenous,
right.

3215
02:38:41,751 --> 02:38:46,280
And more homogenous societies tend to be
more peaceful and happier,

3216
02:38:46,680 --> 02:38:48,500
not,
not more diverse societies.

3217
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:53,800
And they're also small countries,
so they're somewhat easier to govern and

3218
02:38:54,920 --> 02:38:57,530
they tend to be wealthy.
So those.

3219
02:38:57,950 --> 02:39:00,500
So it'd be hard to parse out all those 
contributors,

3220
02:39:00,501 --> 02:39:01,334
right.
To figure out what it is that's making 

3221
02:39:02,301 --> 02:39:07,301
the scandinavians relatively content.
This is almost like a super tribe versus

3222
02:39:07,911 --> 02:39:08,744
a country.
Yeah.

3223
02:39:09,010 --> 02:39:09,600
Yeah,
right.

3224
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:10,433
Well and those,
those sorts of societies in some sense 

3225
02:39:12,141 --> 02:39:14,640
are easier to manage so there are

3226
02:39:14,890 --> 02:39:15,723
benefit to this,
this model that we could perhaps bring 

3227
02:39:20,230 --> 02:39:21,063
to the United States or to Canada and 
maybe mitigate some of the issues that 

3228
02:39:24,851 --> 02:39:25,684
we have between the right and the left.
Like maybe there's some sort of a 

3229
02:39:28,211 --> 02:39:33,070
compromise that will lead to a less less
debate and dispute.

3230
02:39:33,290 --> 02:39:34,123
Well,
I think that you guys in the states are 

3231
02:39:35,931 --> 02:39:38,390
doing real well actually.
Personally.

3232
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:40,370
I mean,
you know,

3233
02:39:41,060 --> 02:39:43,880
your,
your system of checks and balances seems

3234
02:39:43,881 --> 02:39:46,070
to work out pretty well.
There's a fair bit of,

3235
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:50,300
let's say left domination right now of,
of the mainstream media.

3236
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:51,193
I think that's a reasonable claim and 
also of academia and have the 

3237
02:39:54,291 --> 02:39:55,124
intelligentsia,
but the political system is skewed 

3238
02:39:57,291 --> 02:39:59,660
pretty hard to the republican end of 
things at the moment.

3239
02:40:00,050 --> 02:40:02,870
And so that's not a bad balance.
And then in the last election,

3240
02:40:03,170 --> 02:40:04,003
I mean maybe you could make a case 
perhaps that things had tilted a little 

3241
02:40:08,001 --> 02:40:10,310
too far to the republican side,
but that,

3242
02:40:10,311 --> 02:40:11,144
that got balanced out because the 
democrats took the house again and it 

3243
02:40:14,251 --> 02:40:16,260
seems like they were more moderate 
democrats.

3244
02:40:16,261 --> 02:40:19,880
That seems to be the scuttlebutt.
So you know,

3245
02:40:19,890 --> 02:40:23,400
it isn't obvious to me that your system 
isn't functioning well.

3246
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:28,760
I think that one of the things that's 
happening that's making things look more

3247
02:40:29,131 --> 02:40:29,964
contentious than they are is that the 
mainstream media is under such assault 

3248
02:40:35,010 --> 02:40:39,660
by the up and coming media forms 
colluding.

3249
02:40:39,661 --> 02:40:40,494
People like you,
that as their financial models 

3250
02:40:45,090 --> 02:40:48,870
deteriorate and as their journalistic 
standards take a hit,

3251
02:40:48,871 --> 02:40:49,704
and as they lose their fact checkers and
their time to be careful with the 

3252
02:40:52,141 --> 02:40:52,974
stories,
they concentrate more on exaggerating 

3253
02:40:54,691 --> 02:40:57,840
the extremes to attract attention.
And so,

3254
02:40:57,870 --> 02:40:58,703
you know,
there was an article published in the 

3255
02:40:59,401 --> 02:41:02,680
atlantic monthly about a month ago 
showing that didn't.

3256
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:04,410
It depends on how you calculate these 
things,

3257
02:41:04,411 --> 02:41:05,244
but that the radical leftists and the 
radical right wingers are only about 

3258
02:41:07,681 --> 02:41:08,514
five percent of the population on each 
side and that most the vast majority of 

3259
02:41:12,631 --> 02:41:13,464
americans consider themselves something 
approximating the relatively silent 

3260
02:41:16,861 --> 02:41:17,694
majority,
and so I don't think that things are 

3261
02:41:21,151 --> 02:41:21,984
polarized,
is as badly as they seem and it is also 

3262
02:41:25,771 --> 02:41:29,760
the case right now that if you poll 
people and ask them about the conditions

3263
02:41:29,761 --> 02:41:30,594
of their life in the United States,
they tend to say that they're doing 

3264
02:41:32,551 --> 02:41:35,190
quite well,
but that other people aren't.

3265
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:38,550
And so I Think maybe,
I don't know this for sure,

3266
02:41:38,551 --> 02:41:41,850
but,
but I think maybe that the technological

3267
02:41:41,851 --> 02:41:42,684
pressure that's being put on the 
mainstream media is driving extreme 

3268
02:41:45,601 --> 02:41:46,434
political views as a means of gathering 
the attention of a shrinking market 

3269
02:41:50,401 --> 02:41:52,280
share.
That's,

3270
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:53,273
that's a very interesting take on it.
I wonder how detrimental that is to us 

3271
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:57,293
as a whole because we are constantly 
dealing with this click bait you 

3272
02:42:00,640 --> 02:42:02,500
nonsense headline,
you know,

3273
02:42:02,520 --> 02:42:03,241
in every,
every,

3274
02:42:03,241 --> 02:42:05,420
everything is a dispute.
Everything's a war.

3275
02:42:05,690 --> 02:42:07,680
Everything was nerve wracking.
Yes.

3276
02:42:07,690 --> 02:42:08,523
You know,
I mean I noticed this years ago because 

3277
02:42:09,601 --> 02:42:13,140
I really stopped watching the news or 25
years ago,

3278
02:42:13,141 --> 02:42:13,974
although I've been heavily involved in 
the last two years because I noticed 

3279
02:42:16,621 --> 02:42:20,040
that most of what passed for news wasn't
because my sense was,

3280
02:42:20,041 --> 02:42:21,750
well,
if it isn't important in a month,

3281
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:23,033
if it is an important month from now,
it was never important and almost 

3282
02:42:25,801 --> 02:42:28,140
everything that's news is important 
right now,

3283
02:42:28,910 --> 02:42:31,020
and so I tried to stay away from that.

3284
02:42:31,020 --> 02:42:35,550
It was better for my peace of mind and I
often recommended to my clinical clients

3285
02:42:35,551 --> 02:42:36,384
who were depressed and anxious that they
shield themselves from the news as much 

3286
02:42:39,841 --> 02:42:43,590
as possible,
but now there's the news is everywhere,

3287
02:42:44,010 --> 02:42:44,850
right?
It's everywhere.

3288
02:42:44,851 --> 02:42:45,990
It's twitter,
it's facebook,

3289
02:42:45,991 --> 02:42:48,720
it's youtube.
It's like we're just inundated by it.

3290
02:42:48,870 --> 02:42:49,703
It's like cnn on steroids.
It's 24 hour news cycle and it's 

3291
02:42:52,981 --> 02:42:53,814
produced by everyone whether they're 
informed or not and it's really high 

3292
02:42:58,261 --> 02:42:59,094
emotion and I think that that is making 
things look a lot worse to us than they 

3293
02:43:02,611 --> 02:43:03,444
actually are.
I think it's also similar to what we 

3294
02:43:04,791 --> 02:43:05,624
were talking about earlier when it comes
to reading comments on instagram or 

3295
02:43:09,301 --> 02:43:10,134
twitter.
I just think there's just an amount of 

3296
02:43:11,441 --> 02:43:12,220
data.
Yep.

3297
02:43:12,220 --> 02:43:14,560
That's incomprehensible.
I don't think you can handle it.

3298
02:43:14,561 --> 02:43:15,394
I don't think you would navigate it.
You can't navigate that many 

3299
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:17,740
relationships.

3300
02:43:17,980 --> 02:43:18,813
I mean,
the reason why we have this dunbar's 

3301
02:43:20,321 --> 02:43:21,640
number in our head,
we,

3302
02:43:21,790 --> 02:43:24,490
if you're dealing with hundreds of 
thousands of people,

3303
02:43:24,491 --> 02:43:25,324
in your case,
a million followers that are constantly 

3304
02:43:26,891 --> 02:43:29,530
interacting with you,
it's going to fucking drive you mad.

3305
02:43:29,700 --> 02:43:30,533
Well,
you don't even know what to do with it 

3306
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:32,440
because I.
Well,

3307
02:43:32,440 --> 02:43:35,800
I don't even know what my ethical 
obligation is to my twitter followers,

3308
02:43:35,801 --> 02:43:36,634
you know,
because like there's a million people 

3309
02:43:37,241 --> 02:43:39,040
following.
Can't react to all of them.

3310
02:43:39,430 --> 02:43:40,270
Definitely.
Well,

3311
02:43:40,540 --> 02:43:41,373
certainly I know one limitation which is
that having it drive me insane is 

3312
02:43:45,911 --> 02:43:46,744
probably not a good outcome for anyone 
except for those who hope that I would 

3313
02:43:50,231 --> 02:43:53,380
fall back.
Say this is a personal thing,

3314
02:43:53,381 --> 02:43:54,214
right?
Because they're responding and the 

3315
02:43:55,350 --> 02:43:58,660
mentions are to you personally,
but in a lesser way perhaps,

3316
02:43:58,661 --> 02:43:59,494
but still also overwhelming is just the 
sheer amount of information that's 

3317
02:44:04,301 --> 02:44:06,910
available constantly about everything.

3318
02:44:07,380 --> 02:44:08,213
There's,
there's a million stories every day 

3319
02:44:09,881 --> 02:44:12,040
about every single thing that's going on
in your life,

3320
02:44:12,310 --> 02:44:13,210
well,
everywhere,

3321
02:44:13,390 --> 02:44:18,390
everywhere on the planet and how are you
supposed to navigate that?

3322
02:44:18,730 --> 02:44:22,210
How are you supposed to get through life
and concentrate on things that are truly

3323
02:44:22,211 --> 02:44:23,044
meaningful for you in the present moment
without being completely detached from 

3324
02:44:27,041 --> 02:44:27,874
the outside world.
It's this balance that people try to 

3325
02:44:29,621 --> 02:44:30,454
find that is so elusive.
It's so hard to figure out how much to 

3326
02:44:34,301 --> 02:44:35,134
watch.
How much of this political process do I 

3327
02:44:36,551 --> 02:44:37,960
pay attention to?
Well,

3328
02:44:37,961 --> 02:44:40,180
that's the big technological challenge.
yes.

3329
02:44:40,210 --> 02:44:40,721
You know,
I mean,

3330
02:44:40,721 --> 02:44:42,790
we thought when I was a kid we thought,
oh my god,

3331
02:44:42,791 --> 02:44:43,624
you know,
kids are sitting in front of the 

3332
02:44:43,931 --> 02:44:46,000
television four hours a night.
It's like,

3333
02:44:46,001 --> 02:44:47,440
well,
you ain't seen nothing yet.

3334
02:44:48,090 --> 02:44:49,480
No.
All day long.

3335
02:44:49,481 --> 02:44:51,490
No kidding.
Phones all day long.

3336
02:44:51,550 --> 02:44:53,290
Yeah,
and the phones are so much more powerful

3337
02:44:53,291 --> 02:44:54,330
than television that there.

3338
02:44:54,360 --> 02:44:55,193
Well,
it's like a typewriter compared to a 

3339
02:44:55,901 --> 02:44:57,040
computer.
Yes.

3340
02:44:57,041 --> 02:44:57,611
You know,
and yeah,

3341
02:44:57,611 --> 02:44:58,660
it's,
well it's,

3342
02:44:58,700 --> 02:44:59,980
it's,
it's so,

3343
02:45:00,100 --> 02:45:02,620
so we don't know how to adjust to that 
psychologically,

3344
02:45:02,830 --> 02:45:03,663
but it's even worse than that because as
soon as you adjust to the degree that 

3345
02:45:07,901 --> 02:45:09,640
you do,
the technology changes on you.

3346
02:45:09,810 --> 02:45:12,550
Right.
So it was more immersive and it's always

3347
02:45:12,551 --> 02:45:16,510
leading in that direction.
So it's a real mean.

3348
02:45:16,790 --> 02:45:17,623
You know,
I see this especially with parents who 

3349
02:45:19,421 --> 02:45:22,600
have teenage kids.
It's like they know the phones aren't,

3350
02:45:23,060 --> 02:45:23,893
you know,
I've been talking to some teenagers 

3351
02:45:25,001 --> 02:45:26,290
lately about,
about,

3352
02:45:27,310 --> 02:45:28,143
you know,
maybe these are kids that are getting 

3353
02:45:29,291 --> 02:45:31,580
bullied on social media.
It's like think,

3354
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:33,910
well when I was 14,
you know,

3355
02:45:33,911 --> 02:45:34,744
it's kind of a rough time of life and 
you go to school and you've got your 

3356
02:45:36,761 --> 02:45:37,594
friends and you've got your enemies and 
then you come home and your friends 

3357
02:45:40,211 --> 02:45:41,740
aren't there and neither are your 
enemies.

3358
02:45:41,990 --> 02:45:42,740
Right.
You're,

3359
02:45:42,740 --> 02:45:45,700
you're outside.
There's an outside of that.

3360
02:45:46,630 --> 02:45:49,150
But now in social media there's no 
outside.

3361
02:45:49,500 --> 02:45:50,333
You know,
one kid I was talking to had moved 

3362
02:45:52,150 --> 02:45:54,700
schools and he's doing quite well in the
new one,

3363
02:45:54,940 --> 02:45:55,773
but the people from the person's old 
school are still after them on social 

3364
02:45:59,441 --> 02:46:01,720
media,
so you know,

3365
02:46:01,721 --> 02:46:04,150
and you think,
well just don't use your phone.

3366
02:46:04,151 --> 02:46:04,961
It's like,
yeah,

3367
02:46:04,961 --> 02:46:06,730
yeah.
You tell that to your teenager.

3368
02:46:06,850 --> 02:46:08,890
You try not using your phone for a whole
day.

3369
02:46:09,710 --> 02:46:10,191
You think,
well,

3370
02:46:10,191 --> 02:46:12,080
the teenager is going to be able to 
manage the phone.

3371
02:46:12,081 --> 02:46:12,681
It's like,
no,

3372
02:46:12,681 --> 02:46:14,510
they're not.
You can't manage the phone.

3373
02:46:14,570 --> 02:46:17,870
Nobody can manage the flow.
It's not just teenagers.

3374
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:23,080
My middle daughter is 10 years old and 
all of our friends have phones.

3375
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:24,833
All of.
There's like two of her friends that 

3376
02:46:26,181 --> 02:46:29,420
don't have phones and they come over the
house and we have a rule at our house.

3377
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:31,970
You can't use a phone like once you get 
inside the house,

3378
02:46:31,971 --> 02:46:33,770
there's no phones.
You have friends come over the house.

3379
02:46:33,771 --> 02:46:36,170
They want to constantly be on their 
phone and we said like,

3380
02:46:36,171 --> 02:46:38,270
you can't do that.
And they look you like,

3381
02:46:38,271 --> 02:46:40,010
what are you talking about?
This is my life.

3382
02:46:40,460 --> 02:46:41,293
My life is my phone.
They want to make twitter posts and 

3383
02:46:43,611 --> 02:46:46,270
instagram and they want to do facebook 
and they want,

3384
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:47,473
they want to snap chat with each other,
with bunny ears on and that these kids 

3385
02:46:50,691 --> 02:46:54,470
are just doing this all day long and 
they are mastering the technology.

3386
02:46:54,471 --> 02:46:55,304
That's the other thing.
It's not surprising that they're trying 

3387
02:46:56,631 --> 02:46:58,170
to adapt to it,
but.

3388
02:46:58,350 --> 02:46:59,183
But it's happening at a really early age
because if you're giving your kid a 

3389
02:47:01,971 --> 02:47:02,804
phone,
you're not putting any parental filters 

3390
02:47:03,921 --> 02:47:04,754
on it.
You're allowing that kid to have full 

3391
02:47:05,751 --> 02:47:08,420
access to google and the worldwide web 
and they're just going to.

3392
02:47:08,870 --> 02:47:09,703
If you give your kid to phone and you 
don't think they'll know how to use the 

3393
02:47:11,451 --> 02:47:13,580
phone better than you within a year,
you're a fool.

3394
02:47:13,850 --> 02:47:14,683
It's true.
No,

3395
02:47:14,690 --> 02:47:16,490
they're going to.
They're going to have that thing figured

3396
02:47:16,491 --> 02:47:18,350
out in ways that you haven't even 
imagined,

3397
02:47:18,351 --> 02:47:21,410
so you're not controlling it.
That's for sure.

3398
02:47:21,610 --> 02:47:22,443
It's a.
It is a very extraordinarily 

3399
02:47:26,600 --> 02:47:27,433
unprecedented time to sort of navigate 
this world and I don't think any does 

3400
02:47:34,680 --> 02:47:35,480
not have been.
I mean,

3401
02:47:35,480 --> 02:47:37,970
civilizations have a deal with worse 
things,

3402
02:47:37,971 --> 02:47:38,804
right?
In terms of violence and famine and 

3403
02:47:40,370 --> 02:47:41,203
disease,
but I don't think anyone's had to deal 

3404
02:47:42,981 --> 02:47:47,981
with such a,
like a radically transformative medium.

3405
02:47:48,970 --> 02:47:51,340
Like this range of possibilities.
well,

3406
02:47:51,341 --> 02:47:52,970
and you ain't seen nothing yet,
right?

3407
02:47:52,971 --> 02:47:54,800
I mean this is just getting going.
Well.

3408
02:47:54,801 --> 02:47:57,020
Have you been watching the boston 
dynamics videos?

3409
02:47:57,620 --> 02:48:00,100
Oh my god.
Those guys in here.

3410
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:00,860
Oh yeah.

3411
02:48:00,860 --> 02:48:01,693
I bet.
I mean the amount of progress they've 

3412
02:48:03,561 --> 02:48:05,910
made in five years is just absolutely 
staggered,

3413
02:48:05,911 --> 02:48:07,700
but they smell like sulfur and they 
don't even know.

3414
02:48:08,270 --> 02:48:10,430
I bet you bringing me in here.
Go on.

3415
02:48:10,460 --> 02:48:11,293
These guys are doing well.
Elon musk was on the podcast talking 

3416
02:48:13,851 --> 02:48:14,684
about some new development there,
work on called neuro link and that this 

3417
02:48:18,441 --> 02:48:19,274
is some radical new way of accentuating 
bandwidth between human beings and 

3418
02:48:23,391 --> 02:48:26,780
information and just increasing the 
access to it.

3419
02:48:26,781 --> 02:48:30,870
And he was very vague about it.
He said it was going to come out within,

3420
02:48:30,871 --> 02:48:32,300
you know,
x amount of months.

3421
02:48:32,370 --> 02:48:33,410
Yeah.
Well they've already,

3422
02:48:33,411 --> 02:48:34,244
you know,
there are scientists who've already 

3423
02:48:35,390 --> 02:48:38,870
managed direct brain to computer links.
Right?

3424
02:48:38,871 --> 02:48:40,370
So you can get monkeys,
for example,

3425
02:48:40,371 --> 02:48:42,470
to move a robotic arm.
And so,

3426
02:48:42,471 --> 02:48:44,250
and I suspect that,
you knoW,

3427
02:48:44,410 --> 02:48:45,470
you're,
you can,

3428
02:48:45,530 --> 02:48:48,530
you can learn to control single neurons 
in your face.

3429
02:48:48,860 --> 02:48:49,693
My suspicions are that we'll be able to 
develop technologies that'll be 

3430
02:48:51,891 --> 02:48:54,020
wearable,
that won't have to be neural implants,

3431
02:48:54,021 --> 02:48:55,900
that you'll be able to communicate with 
neurally.

3432
02:48:56,400 --> 02:48:59,110
And if that's not very far down the road
and the,

3433
02:48:59,111 --> 02:49:00,190
uh,
you know,

3434
02:49:00,200 --> 02:49:03,170
the probability that we're going to 
build,

3435
02:49:07,450 --> 02:49:08,000
you know,

3436
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:08,960
you know about,
uh,

3437
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:09,833
what's his name,
kurtzweil his idea of the singularity 

3438
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:15,060
and well,
that's a wild idea and it seems somewhat

3439
02:49:15,061 --> 02:49:17,460
improbable.
And I had a friend who once told me that

3440
02:49:18,210 --> 02:49:20,550
if something's impossible then it won't 
happen.

3441
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:24,060
There'll be something that will come up 
to stop it that you won't expect.

3442
02:49:24,061 --> 02:49:26,100
And maybe the singularity is one of 
those things.

3443
02:49:26,101 --> 02:49:27,270
But,
you know,

3444
02:49:27,271 --> 02:49:28,104
I know a lot of guys who were in the 
high end co computational world and a 

3445
02:49:32,101 --> 02:49:34,830
lot of them are convinced that we're 
within a decade of a machine.

3446
02:49:34,831 --> 02:49:35,664
This is powerful as a human brain.
And I know people have been saying that 

3447
02:49:37,561 --> 02:49:39,480
for a long time,
but jesus,

3448
02:49:39,481 --> 02:49:40,314
you know,
computers are getting good at emotion 

3449
02:49:41,761 --> 02:49:42,594
recognition.
They're getting really good at facial 

3450
02:49:43,981 --> 02:49:46,110
recognition.
They can communicate with one another,

3451
02:49:46,111 --> 02:49:46,944
they can imitate those boston dynamic 
robots are pretty damn impressive and 

3452
02:49:50,161 --> 02:49:51,420
they're mostly autonomous.

3453
02:49:52,200 --> 02:49:54,510
we've got all sorts of things that can 
navigate on their own,

3454
02:49:54,511 --> 02:49:57,180
like these autonomous cars,
like all these things are.

3455
02:49:57,950 --> 02:49:58,783
They're coming together real fast.
Have you ever watched black mirror on 

3456
02:50:01,591 --> 02:50:02,424
netflix?
The only one I watched was the one that 

3457
02:50:04,351 --> 02:50:07,200
outlined what the chinese are now doing 
to their own people.

3458
02:50:07,290 --> 02:50:08,500
Oh yeah.
The crisper.

3459
02:50:09,470 --> 02:50:10,051
No,
no.

3460
02:50:10,051 --> 02:50:12,610
The one where everything you do is rated
right?

3461
02:50:12,630 --> 02:50:14,500
The social network one,
right,

3462
02:50:14,501 --> 02:50:15,130
right,
right.

3463
02:50:15,130 --> 02:50:15,960
Yeah.
Switch,

3464
02:50:15,960 --> 02:50:16,793
which is quite frightening and 
reasonably probable 100 percent 

3465
02:50:20,011 --> 02:50:22,470
probable.
I was talking about the one,

3466
02:50:22,800 --> 02:50:23,633
I think it's called heavy metal.
It's about autonomous robots that seek 

3467
02:50:26,941 --> 02:50:27,774
out people and kill them and these 
artificial intelligence people that are 

3468
02:50:32,551 --> 02:50:35,730
making these boston dynamic robots and 
you know,

3469
02:50:35,731 --> 02:50:38,190
the.
The scariest one that I read about was a

3470
02:50:38,191 --> 02:50:41,950
darpa one called the eater robot,
ea t r.

3471
02:50:42,510 --> 02:50:45,900
It operates on.
It uses as a fuel.

3472
02:50:45,950 --> 02:50:50,790
It uses biological material as fuel,
which means if you're kidding,

3473
02:50:50,850 --> 02:50:51,661
no kidding.
No,

3474
02:50:51,661 --> 02:50:53,520
I'm not kidding.
jesus see a car,

3475
02:50:53,730 --> 02:50:54,563
so this is going to be able to eat dead 
bodies in the field theoretically and 

3476
02:51:00,871 --> 02:51:02,730
use it as fuel to kill.
good.

3477
02:51:02,790 --> 02:51:03,623
Oh good.
That sounds like a fine thing to 

3478
02:51:04,601 --> 02:51:09,601
develop.
Fucking imagine an army of robotic armed

3479
02:51:10,650 --> 02:51:13,290
artificially intelligent things.
Corp cedars,

3480
02:51:13,350 --> 02:51:17,100
eat corpses in order to have fuel to 
continue to kill someone's.

3481
02:51:17,101 --> 02:51:21,300
Obviously imagining that it's made and 
this is a real thing.

3482
02:51:21,301 --> 02:51:21,691
Yeah.
Well,

3483
02:51:21,691 --> 02:51:22,524
I mean,
part of the reason that I'm doing what 

3484
02:51:24,361 --> 02:51:26,340
I'm doing with regards to these lectures
is,

3485
02:51:26,341 --> 02:51:27,174
you know,
I think that we're in a time of 

3486
02:51:27,991 --> 02:51:28,824
unparalleled possibility,
so for good and for and for evil and 

3487
02:51:33,901 --> 02:51:36,870
that the more people that there are out 
there who have their acts together,

3488
02:51:36,871 --> 02:51:37,704
the better the probability that we're 
going to be able to manage it because 

3489
02:51:39,931 --> 02:51:43,080
we've all got some pretty hard decisions
to make coming up real fast,

3490
02:51:43,550 --> 02:51:45,300
you know,
and these guys that are working on these

3491
02:51:45,301 --> 02:51:46,134
ai systems,
I'm hoping that the ones that are more 

3492
02:51:48,271 --> 02:51:49,104
ethically oriented in a proper direction
will be the ones that have the upper 

3493
02:51:51,661 --> 02:51:52,350
hand.

3494
02:51:52,350 --> 02:51:56,010
I'm really hoping that so yeah.
Collectively,

3495
02:51:56,011 --> 02:51:59,370
and what I was looking into it,
because this came up before,

3496
02:51:59,371 --> 02:52:03,990
that it breaks the geneva conventions if
they actually eat dead bodies,

3497
02:52:04,290 --> 02:52:06,130
you can't do that.
Yeah,

3498
02:52:06,131 --> 02:52:06,964
whatever.
It's once we have a robot war dude that 

3499
02:52:09,840 --> 02:52:12,280
even conventions out the window.
Yeah.

3500
02:52:12,281 --> 02:52:13,114
No,
I,

3501
02:52:14,750 --> 02:52:17,950
I couldn't agree with you more and I 
think I'm personally,

3502
02:52:17,951 --> 02:52:20,770
this is important and collectively it's 
very important that,

3503
02:52:20,771 --> 02:52:21,760
uh,
I mean I just think it's,

3504
02:52:22,570 --> 02:52:26,680
I think what you wrote 12 rules to life.
We need rules.

3505
02:52:26,681 --> 02:52:30,040
We need rules to be able to figure out 
how to navigate this thing.

3506
02:52:30,980 --> 02:52:34,450
That's where I think that the individual
level of analysis is the right one,

3507
02:52:34,451 --> 02:52:36,310
is that I'm hoping that,
you know,

3508
02:52:36,311 --> 02:52:39,370
that like every time someone comes up 
and talks to me and says,

3509
02:52:39,371 --> 02:52:39,850
look,
you know,

3510
02:52:39,850 --> 02:52:42,550
I was in a dark place and I got my life 
together and this is how it's going.

3511
02:52:42,550 --> 02:52:47,550
I think that tilts the scales non 
trivially towards a good outcome and the

3512
02:52:49,241 --> 02:52:51,280
more people that that's happening to the
better.

3513
02:52:51,370 --> 02:52:52,203
And I don't think there's a more 
effective way of doing it than to 

3514
02:52:53,741 --> 02:52:55,600
concentrate on the individual.
Now.

3515
02:52:55,601 --> 02:52:57,640
I don't think there is either and it's 
happening a lot,

3516
02:52:57,700 --> 02:52:58,161
you know,
I,

3517
02:52:58,161 --> 02:53:00,220
I hear it every day.
I hear it everyday.

3518
02:53:00,310 --> 02:53:01,143
People that find you and find a lot of 
other inspirational people online and 

3519
02:53:04,540 --> 02:53:08,620
jocko and there's so many of them.
There's so many and there's so much fuel

3520
02:53:08,621 --> 02:53:11,260
now for inspiration.
There's so much pretty fun that,

3521
02:53:11,530 --> 02:53:14,110
that inspiration could become popular.
Yeah,

3522
02:53:14,170 --> 02:53:16,000
it's crazy.
I saw this company.

3523
02:53:16,010 --> 02:53:16,750
Yeah,
no kidding,

3524
02:53:16,750 --> 02:53:18,160
no kidding.
And encouragement.

3525
02:53:18,161 --> 02:53:18,994
And one of the things that's quite sad 
is how little encouragement people need 

3526
02:53:23,081 --> 02:53:24,630
and it's so touching,
you know,

3527
02:53:24,760 --> 02:53:28,330
because I'm constantly in a state of 
being overwhelmed.

3528
02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:29,253
Well,
even with what happened this morning 

3529
02:53:29,861 --> 02:53:31,270
when I went to whole foods,
you know,

3530
02:53:31,300 --> 02:53:34,240
because it's overwhelming to have people
come up and like they share these really

3531
02:53:34,241 --> 02:53:36,820
intimate pieces of their life with you 
in 20 seconds.

3532
02:53:36,820 --> 02:53:38,710
You know,
iT's like you're an old friend,

3533
02:53:38,711 --> 02:53:40,930
you know,
and here's what my life was like.

3534
02:53:40,931 --> 02:53:41,711
It's dark,
you know,

3535
02:53:41,711 --> 02:53:44,080
it's dark and here's a bunch of good 
things that are happening.

3536
02:53:44,081 --> 02:53:44,914
It's like this little blast of.
It's like the persona of the person 

3537
02:53:48,161 --> 02:53:51,160
disappears and you get to see the real 
person there for like 20 seconds.

3538
02:53:51,161 --> 02:53:53,140
It's like it's really,
it's overwhelming,

3539
02:53:53,470 --> 02:53:55,750
but every time that happens,
as far as I'm concerned,

3540
02:53:55,751 --> 02:53:59,050
it's a victory.
It's a victory that multiplies to as far

3541
02:53:59,051 --> 02:54:01,000
as I'm concerned.
So I'm hoping that,

3542
02:54:02,350 --> 02:54:04,150
well,
every little bit helps,

3543
02:54:04,151 --> 02:54:06,070
you know that.
It certainly does.

3544
02:54:06,130 --> 02:54:08,020
And by the way,
if you meet me and you have one of those

3545
02:54:08,021 --> 02:54:11,230
stories and I don't know how to react,
that's just how it is,

3546
02:54:11,530 --> 02:54:12,310
you know?
I go,

3547
02:54:12,310 --> 02:54:13,210
wow,
that's amazing.

3548
02:54:13,211 --> 02:54:13,820
Yeah.
Well that's,

3549
02:54:13,820 --> 02:54:15,790
that's good man.
Super happy.

3550
02:54:16,990 --> 02:54:19,390
Genuinely happy for you,
but I still don't know how to react.

3551
02:54:19,391 --> 02:54:20,760
That's how to react.
I don't,

3552
02:54:20,770 --> 02:54:24,250
I'll never will learn how to react,
how to react.

3553
02:54:24,251 --> 02:54:25,930
That's all you need is like,
that's great man.

3554
02:54:25,931 --> 02:54:26,764
I hope you keep doing it.
That's power today and it always feels 

3555
02:54:29,560 --> 02:54:30,850
flat,
you know?

3556
02:54:30,890 --> 02:54:34,140
I mean like with a set is so mind 
blowing and I'm saying terrific.

3557
02:54:34,320 --> 02:54:36,300
Yeah,
but it is terrific.

3558
02:54:36,301 --> 02:54:37,630
That is terrific.
It is,

3559
02:54:37,631 --> 02:54:38,680
it is.
Absolutely.

3560
02:54:39,460 --> 02:54:41,410
We just didn't have three hours.
It's gone.

3561
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:42,450
Thank you sir.
Oh,

3562
02:54:42,451 --> 02:54:44,440
it's good to see a Joan Pearson.
You're good,

3563
02:54:44,441 --> 02:54:46,170
man.
It's a pleasure to be here.

3564
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:48,070
Thanks very much.
