1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,500
Five,
four,

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,580
three,
three,

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,520
two live ladies.
Gentlemen.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,150
A thousand episodes.
Tom Scorah,

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,180
Joey motherfucking Diaz.
We're,

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,020
we're delayed in starting.
Ladies and gentlemen.

7
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,830
We did not have a lighter.
That was a real panic set in.

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,900
That's embarrassing.
Yeah.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,260
I thought I thought some shit was really
going to go down,

10
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,860
but thank God I am petrified of 
earthquakes and situations.

11
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:36,861
I don't put slippers on.
I sleep with sneakers on generator,

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,200
a dog store.
Water,

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,410
water tools.
I got two weapons.

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,880
I got an a on.
Have you been out here for an 

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:48,880
earthquake?
Uh,

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,580
one of them that didn't scare me but I 
was just sitting by the computer and I 

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,950
was looking at the cat bowls.
Yeah.

18
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,190
Yeah.
You get high and I was looking at the 

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:00:59,190
cat.
So it was another cat bowls and all of a

20
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,280
sudden the whole building tip.
Sure.

21
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,650
The cat balls up in the air spinning and
the cats running for their lives.

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,100
They acted.
They were acting with a couple of 

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,100
seconds before that.
And that's why I go.

24
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,100
Why are they so fucked up?
Oh,

25
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:13,750
they were acting weird before the earth 
quarter your.

26
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,030
So I started looking at the cat bowls 
dog stuff that they're doing that all of

27
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:25,731
a sudden the dog,
I just saw the cat bowls or it's like a 

28
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:28,371
cartoon went up in the air spending the 
earthquake and the whole building 

29
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:29,010
shifted.
I heard the bricks,

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,610
the whole thing.
I told her about it being at night's 

31
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:34,610
sleep apnea,
you gotta have a conveyor,

32
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,950
whatever the fuck.
And they sold for $600.

33
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:41,951
You get one with everything.
Lights an iron it fucking clean is your 

34
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:44,090
water.
It's scary as shit when Shit,

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,150
you panic about what earthquakes are 
likely if you,

36
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,060
when you before you move here,
you know,

37
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,460
and then you like,
I remember the first week I was here,

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,760
I was in an apartment in Sherman oaks 
and I was standing at the kitchen 

39
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,880
counter of this person's apartment on 
their laptop doing like sending an email

40
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,940
and I felt a little and I go in my head,
I go,

41
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:03,750
oh,
that's the subway.

42
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,350
And I kept typing and then he could feel
that.

43
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:08,070
And I was like,
yeah.

44
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,120
And he's like crazy,
right?

45
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,010
That's the earth shake underneath your 
feet.

46
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:11,820
And I was like,
ugh.

47
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,680
And it's like a panic sets in and you're
like,

48
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,830
oh my God,
like I've,

49
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,850
I've actually experienced the earth 
moving now.

50
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,860
And then the next step is like when you 
are,

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,360
you're like,
if you're asleep and then you hear like 

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,360
you feel the dresser,
the dresser,

53
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,360
you know,
or,

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
or something that's hanging on your wall
bumping,

55
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,540
you know,
what the fuck's going on,

56
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,500
it takes you that extra beat to figure 
out you're going through an earthquake.

57
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,450
That extra beat is fucked.
It's funny.

58
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:36,930
Have you been through?
Nothing big but like fives,

59
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,820
five point fives,
a couple of those.

60
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,750
The first one I was in was an aftershock
of the northridge earthquake.

61
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:47,751
I was uh,
staying in north Hollywood and I was in 

62
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,570
this shitty apartment.
It was made out of like fucking the same

63
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:53,571
boxes that they used to ship 
refrigerators and like literally the 

64
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:54,630
walls when the earthquake hit the walls 
just went to with this.

65
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,350
I mean,
like the whole thing was just like a 

66
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:00,350
giant was pushing on the scariest.
Fuck,

67
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:00,910
right.
Yeah.

68
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:03,120
Well it's humbling because you realize 
like,

69
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:05,500
this is nothing.
This isn't tune up the street,

70
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:10,501
this is not going over any houses.
Imagine what it felt like when that big 

71
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:13,690
one hit and it hit for 30 seconds for 
30,

72
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,770
30 seconds is so long to feel the ground
moving.

73
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,300
That's one of those people moved to 
boulder.

74
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,560
That's why that was just going to say 
that when you have that experience,

75
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,820
there's some people that because app for
a few days after the North Ridge,

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,730
there was aftershocks and there's people
that want.

77
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,760
They look at their kids and go,
I'm not going through this together and 

78
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,450
we'll.
We're working on Wilshire big building.

79
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,780
What if house.
So a lot of people just a bad.

80
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,750
That's what everybody's waiting for an 
earthquake here because then people 

81
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,270
leave and they sell their houses for 
dirt cheap.

82
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,800
But it does happen.

83
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,190
What gun?
They don't ever want to experience it 

84
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,561
again.
But then I see a guy like my uncles 

85
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:00,190
lived here 55 and I've asked him,
were you ever scared?

86
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:00,760
And he goes,
you know,

87
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:04,330
you're feeling but do.
When I first moved here,

88
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:09,390
before I first moved here,
I was out here for meetings and I went 

89
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,530
by a section of the highway,
I think it was the 10 that had collapsed

90
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,490
and they were moving cars around it and 
as we are.

91
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,700
Is this what happened?
Yeah.

92
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:22,020
What is this an apartment building that 
collapsed the North Ridge earthquake in 

93
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,020
northridge.
One.

94
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,180
Yeah,
dude,

95
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,990
that was a fucking serious earthquake,
man.

96
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah,
like fucking serious.

97
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,160
And when I was driving by this one 
section of the highway,

98
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:35,170
it collapsed on the lower section and I 
remember thinking that's just shit luck 

99
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,830
like this right here.
Yeah.

100
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,690
Yeah.
Like you could be there and that is just

101
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,710
shitload is really the thing lands on 
you and that's how you go.

102
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,910
I'm sorry.
I am a hardworking individual.

103
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,960
I really try to do anything I could to 
help myself.

104
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,830
But when people call me,
telling me they want me to go to a 

105
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,920
meeting in Santa Monica after like 
three,

106
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,310
unless I'm picking up an envelope,
I tell them no matter that kid won the 

107
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,481
Oscar for modern family and they said I 
was always the guy that went to ocean 

108
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:07,700
avenue,
would five of those were additions.

109
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,410
You deserve an Oscar because when you 
switched from the 10 zero five,

110
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,950
you've got to wait on that ramp first 
world privilege right there,

111
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,820
fucking high and you're in the middle of
that ramp.

112
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,050
Your mind starts playing.
I'm telling you,

113
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,540
I've been stuck on that ramp.
I mean,

114
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:28,300
I've gone never get a man.
I just want to go through this ramp.

115
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,610
I don't ever want to be in the middle of
that ramp.

116
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,960
That's not good.
Not Good.

117
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:36,961
Your mind starts playing with you and 
you remember that goes into images and 

118
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:36,961
you go,
fuck that.

119
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:37,210
Okay,
let me.

120
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,610
Let's plan this right now.
If the shit hits the fan,

121
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:41,770
this thing shakes to the ground.
Where are we going?

122
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,910
[inaudible]?
Listen,

123
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,960
one of the main reasons why I like being
in La is because I like you guys.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,780
Yeah,
so we're going to all go like I like for

125
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:51,370
real,
like 100 percent like that.

126
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,460
That was the thing that bothered me the 
most about Colorado.

127
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,300
I,
I,

128
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,890
there was a lot of Nice people out 
there,

129
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,640
but I didn't know you guys weren't out 
there.

130
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,460
It's a weird feeling when we work 
together on,

131
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,900
but there's something fun about running 
into you guys all the time.

132
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,420
Like it makes life better.
We do send it to the store,

133
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,260
the factory in wherever we're at,
we're.

134
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,820
It's more fun.
It makes life more fun.

135
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,960
This podcast,
100 percent I would do it.

136
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,060
Group moved to Colorado.
That's what I'm talking about.

137
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,180
State.
That's what we do.

138
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,130
The group moved to.
Colorado is the right way.

139
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,100
You've got to remember guys.
It's not a decision that it could be.

140
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,650
You go home.
Mrs Rogan sits you down and go,

141
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,680
that's it.
I'm not living this.

142
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,890
Yeah,
that's what.

143
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,660
That's how.
In fact,

144
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,410
I packed the bags,
get back Colorado without a whole cow.

145
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,730
People.
It affects that way.

146
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,780
Oh yeah,
but they go like this ends today with 

147
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:45,780
that,
with that earthquake.

148
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,310
Some you feel it.
If you feel that motherfucker,

149
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,190
the ones that take down highways,
if you feel that you're like,

150
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,010
oh my God,
like,

151
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,050
and this is not even a really big one.
Really big ones changed the shape of 

152
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,050
continence.
True.

153
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,320
I mean that's the real fear.

154
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,360
The real fear is,
is a giant one,

155
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:06,410
like a 10 or an 11 part of you by the 
way always feels kind of crazy.

156
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:11,411
Like when I was growing up in Florida 
with hurricanes that like after a 

157
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:11,800
hurricane you're like,
are we staying after?

158
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,600
This happens all the time.
That's Florida Florida's mentality.

159
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:19,601
Like we just brought up a good beer,
but there's a hurricane that for 

160
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:21,980
whatever reason I feel like if you just 
in the basement,

161
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,410
the top blows off the thing and you just
fucking strapped.

162
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,300
Or sometime like a wild ride at 
Disneyland,

163
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,700
but now they give you these warnings.
They're like,

164
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,150
you're definitely going to die.
You're at the beach and people still are

165
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:32,830
like,
fuck it.

166
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,530
Yeah.
Oh,

167
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,850
for sure.
My friend's mom,

168
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,500
his mom is like 70 something years old 
and this big one was coming.

169
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,030
They're like,
this time we're not fucking around,

170
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,060
this is a category five,
this is going to absolutely devastate 

171
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,060
this area.

172
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,120
And she was like,
absolutely not.

173
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,040
I've been here 40 something years,
nothing ever fucking happens.

174
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,850
And he begged her and she was like,
no.

175
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,120
And it's like,
you know,

176
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,740
those are all those reports are always 
rolling the dice because they,

177
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,770
they'll,
they'll say it's going to be this bad 

178
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:02,770
and then it'll,
you know,

179
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:02,770
it'll turn or to land different.
Yeah.

180
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,420
And it turned into like a tropical 
storm.

181
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,210
She was safe.
She was like the only person that stayed

182
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,690
like everybody else.
We would always bail.

183
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,780
I don't know if you were ever there for 
hurricane.

184
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,010
No,
but like we would always book it man.

185
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:18,160
As soon as they were like,
this thing is going to land,

186
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:18,670
we're like,
no,

187
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,710
there's no way.
And even driving in those tropical 

188
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,561
storms was an real men.
Like you can't see an inch in front of 

189
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:32,261
the car.
It's like you're driving through a car 

190
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:32,261
wash.

191
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:32,261
We had to stop once.
Will you with me?

192
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,430
When Eddie did that seminar in Miami 
when we were working at West Palm.

193
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,570
Did you go down with us?
No,

194
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,840
we went.
We Eddie's doing a seminar in West Palm 

195
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:40,910
or in in Miami.
We're in West Palm.

196
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:45,911
It's like a half hour away,
so we left to go to the seminar and we 

197
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:49,961
were stopped dead on the highway.
You could not see an inch in front of 

198
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,000
the windshield.
It's amazing.

199
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,580
It lasted for about 15 minutes,
but it was too damn sky opened up the 

200
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,740
time there all the time.
We don't even know what rain is.

201
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,800
No,
we don't even know and I never knew 

202
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:06,800
growing up,
like in Boston growing up,

203
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,180
growing up in Boston,
I never saw that we saw it rain.

204
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,910
We never saw that.
That's some next level.

205
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:14,060
I haven't really seen it duplicated 
since leaving there.

206
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,850
It's pretty crazy child.
I saw one bad rainstorm in Jersey with a

207
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:23,490
cloud's got dark.
Yeah.

208
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,630
It started hailing.
Well.

209
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,410
Have you been looped through Halan,
Colorado as well as the videos of what?

210
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,720
People's cars are just coming around it 
and there's one guy,

211
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,810
one guy had a film of a lake,
they were watching it and it slowly 

212
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:38,810
ramps up.
It's like one,

213
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,510
two,
one,

214
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:40,050
two,
and he's like,

215
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:41,220
well,
look at the size of this hail,

216
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,340
and then all of a sudden it's fun.
It's literally like being attacked with 

217
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,420
rocks from space.
Like,

218
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,600
look at this pool.
Yeah,

219
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,730
there's a gang of these men,
but like,

220
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:58,731
look at this one that that's rock rocks.
It fucks people's cars.

221
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,870
Destroys,
destroys call,

222
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:04,220
and that was just happening to Colorado 
water dude.

223
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Thousand roofers moved to Colorado 
because there's work for two fucking 

224
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,600
years.
Can you look at it?

225
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,570
It's getting worse.
This is insane,

226
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,240
dude.
You get K okay.

227
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:16,740
Especially if you're like a little kid.
Oh,

228
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,750
definitely.
Being a five year old out in this 

229
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,970
fucking pummeled to death.
Does anybody ever died from Hale?

230
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,880
Has to have happened.
Seems like it stops the girl.

231
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,740
The first week I moved to Atlanta Monday
and that Friday was the north Hollywood 

232
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,560
shootout.
Oh,

233
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,990
I'm not sure that we've got that Monday.
I came in.

234
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,830
I was living with Stan.
Yeah.

235
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,950
Went to find the job that Friday and 
there was a bunch of traffic and they 

236
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:46,950
were like,
Nah,

237
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,231
there's north Hollywood shooting north 
Hollywood shootout changed policing 

238
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:56,541
nationwide.
You know that that incident changed the 

239
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,410
way they viewed having weapons changed 
their training.

240
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:03,411
They never even competent contemplated 
that people would rob a bank with like 

241
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,740
fully automatic.
You're coming up with the body,

242
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,100
but just fucking blind.

243
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,110
It was laying by a car after he was hit 
just shooting up at helicopters and 

244
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,270
shit.
That was fucking crazy,

245
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:20,271
man.
I remember that national news that was 

246
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:20,271
just like a big.
You couldn't get on the one on one.

247
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,710
I was in the news radio break room.
We were,

248
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,720
we were getting ready to film a scene 
and we're watching me and candy 

249
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,300
Alexander huddled up together going,
what the fuck?

250
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,280
Everybody came in,
guys get in here,

251
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:33,570
get in here.
But they're all in.

252
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:35,010
They're watching.
They're like,

253
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:37,800
what in the fuck?
And it changed the way they,

254
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,830
uh,
what kind of tactics they use and the 

255
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,050
equipment they give police absolutely 
did 38 SPEC.

256
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,860
Then they still reference it all the 
time.

257
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:52,070
I did a ride along two months ago with 
the Hollywood division dude and I was a 

258
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:52,950
guy was still talking about.
He's like,

259
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:54,040
we have this because

260
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,240
of this shootout.
The end,

261
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:56,350
you know,
that's a lot of people say,

262
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,380
Oh man,
fuck in the militarization of the 

263
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,380
police,
man.

264
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,680
This is what.
There's a lot of it that's not good.

265
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,510
You give to people too much power.
It's not good,

266
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,110
but if some shit happens like that,
they need that.

267
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,130
Otherwise they're sitting ducks.
Yeah,

268
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,820
kind of weapons.
You get on the streets right now.

269
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,050
Oh Dude,
you only fuck crazy shit.

270
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,070
Fire firepower.
You get on the streets from Ar 15 and 

271
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,770
you get some wild shit on the fucking 
street.

272
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:21,120
Yeah.
Oh,

273
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,130
you have to do.
Is this number two real quick 

274
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,750
mathematics for anybody's interested.
There's $350 million people somewhere 

275
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,021
around in this country.
There's more guns in there are people 

276
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:31,021
and they're still making guns everyday.
They make guns.

277
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:33,310
There's a gun making industry.
It's gigantic.

278
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,610
They're making all kinds of guns all 
over the country.

279
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,420
Right?
Every year,

280
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:39,220
like every other,
maybe more higher tech.

281
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,640
Not Getting rid of any guns?
No.

282
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,370
No.
Like all those guns for toys.

283
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Oh,
give back to your gun and you'll get a 

284
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:47,400
toy.
Okay.

285
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,100
And then yourself?
Someone who's a factory going on right 

286
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,441
now.
They're cranking out ar as compassion 

287
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:52,441
and one person like,
here you go.

288
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:56,350
Some rusty old,
22 fucking handball court.

289
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:58,320
But you get anything like jumping.
Right?

290
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,770
I can't believe they're playing 
handball.

291
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:02,680
Still dedicated to handball who's like,
I'm going to be the best.

292
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:06,040
When you get out of prison doing prison,
they play handball.

293
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,260
So when you get out your claim 
disability,

294
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,160
you play handball and it's to cover for 
you that you were half a momo,

295
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:14,980
but you play handball.
So guns that kill,

296
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,560
you'll get a gun at a handball court for
$50.

297
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:22,561
That's shot three people that God has 
missed a motherfucking a motherfucking 

298
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,550
charlotte was so a motherfucker 
committed suicide.

299
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,760
Long range with those guns.
They don't give a fuck.

300
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,330
They got guns that don't miss that.
Handball courts.

301
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:36,450
Did you play?
You play handball in prison that you 

302
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,360
said?
I played handball like the first two 

303
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:38,360
weeks.
That just wasn't for me.

304
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,050
You played in Colorado and because there
was a few guys from the Bronx,

305
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,740
so when I went to summit county,
because I was arrested in boulder,

306
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,130
but once you start your state sentence,
they were going to send me to the 

307
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:50,980
Missouri or Texas.
I ended up going to summit county.

308
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,060
Summit County is like,
we don't really have bars.

309
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,290
Yeah,
don't know.

310
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,220
You could just do what you want here.
Yeah.

311
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,230
At night at 10:00,
the God would go to the pathmark 

312
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,990
pathmark like a supermarket and get his 
chips and soda.

313
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,140
It was like a fucking daycare.
Wow.

314
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,220
Everyone got along pretty well.
You're a young guy with a dude from the 

315
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,130
bronx that played handball and we became
friends together.

316
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,910
He had been on the run for 12 years,
but this guy was brilliant.

317
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,670
He was fucking brilliant.
Like the shit he had done.

318
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,830
He had driven the cop's car,
like,

319
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,480
what's that movie Leonardo Dicaprio cash
pay for your care.

320
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,560
That he was that guy and the final thing
he did for them was if they caught him 

321
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,330
and he set them up on the drugs thing,
like I read the paperwork.

322
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,160
It was brilliant.
He set him up on a drug drugs thing.

323
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,660
He said,
I know where I could go buy 10 kilos of 

324
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,720
coke.
The cops actually gave him $250,000

325
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:47,580
cash to buy the 10 kilos of coke.
He set it up with his friend,

326
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,530
didn't have a car behind the house.
The car was empty,

327
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,180
the house was empty.
There was no cops.

328
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:55,550
Never even did a background check to see
who lived in the house.

329
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,550
Jesus the house was empty.
He went through the front and went out 

330
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,950
the back and disappeared.
Travel for 10 years and he came back to 

331
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,270
the states because his dad died and they
arrested him.

332
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,660
He took a million years ago.
He went for like a rubric and just 

333
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:14,120
played shuffleboard.
Handball.

334
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
That's a dark world.
The world of the ex.

335
00:15:16,421 --> 00:15:16,850
Pat?
No,

336
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:19,630
South American tourists communities.
Yeah.

337
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,530
That's like that.
Or a sizable too,

338
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:23,720
right?
I mean all over.

339
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,290
All over Mexico.
There's a lot of people in Brazil and I 

340
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,331
had a friend that South American dad was
a island hopping all throughout his 

341
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,740
adolescence just to avoid taxes,
just to avoid taxes.

342
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:42,170
And then the crazy thing to me is that 
is that they came here like they came 

343
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,010
back eventually and so is he in trouble?
And he's like,

344
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,600
no,
how is he not in trouble?

345
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,830
He was like,
I don't know,

346
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,140
why aren't they going to catch him?

347
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:48,740
And he's like,
no,

348
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,680
what do you mean man?
Like he's here now.

349
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,950
Like is that a whole new identity?
No,

350
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,390
just don't worry about does he paid 
taxes?

351
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,130
He said No.
And he's like,

352
00:15:58,131 --> 00:15:59,590
well he doesn't,
she still does.

353
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,310
And then my friend was still like,
you know,

354
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:03,990
you don't have to pay taxes.
And I was one of those guys.

355
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,170
He goes,
ah.

356
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,130
He goes,
Google it.

357
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,390
It's like you have to pay taxes when 
that's your thing.

358
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:12,700
Like just look it up man.
God Damn it.

359
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,600
Pay Your taxes to lock you up so quick.
It doesn't matter if you pay them.

360
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,660
See if you owe money to say like Exxon,
you know,

361
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,490
whatever,
they'll sue you.

362
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,500
You have to pay the money.
You paid the money.

363
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,610
But if the irs,
if you owe money to the irs,

364
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,070
they put you in a fucking cage for sure.

365
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,330
Godless of if you pay,
let's say,

366
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,600
even if you don't,
even if you agree to pay it,

367
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,180
say,
yeah,

368
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,830
you're going to go in a cage first.
Yeah,

369
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,680
no,
pay your company money.

370
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,160
They file a judgment against you and 
then they sell the paper and then you 

371
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,160
get called a comedy clubs.
Like I used to,

372
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,730
you know,
when I first started comedy,

373
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:50,120
I owed so much money.
Did you really go to a comedy club?

374
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,270
The manager goes,
you just got a call to recall,

375
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,190
and I go,
Holy Shit.

376
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,940
If Hbo really like collection,
collect my mind,

377
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:01,070
that would go with HBO.
Oh Shit.

378
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,460
I don't ever go joey.
It's the same guy and I'd pick up the 

379
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:06,460
phone.
Joey a discover card.

380
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,550
We never got that payment.
Motherfucker.

381
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:12,820
Why fucking figure it out.
They have tremendous scabs.

382
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:17,821
Are People looking for you?
They have a computer that they'll go on 

383
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:21,430
to see what other numbers that usually 
call you and they'll get that number 

384
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:27,101
when they call you,
that number will come up over your 

385
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:30,311
caller id.
They do some illegal shit when they're 

386
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:33,281
looking for you,
but when you get a judgment from exon 

387
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:33,281
seven years,
you don't pay it.

388
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:34,850
It goes away.
The government,

389
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,970
that judgment never goes away.
That the student loan these 

390
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,640
motherfuckers to tell student loans to 
suck that Dick.

391
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:45,641
Oh yeah.
Student loans come even more intense by 

392
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:45,641
arrest.
Yeah.

393
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:46,060
Well,
you know,

394
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,070
that's all the government as well.
That's the thing about student loans is 

395
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,070
it doesn't get erased when you go to 
bankruptcy.

396
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,790
If you filed for bankruptcy,
anything else is gone.

397
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,040
You know,
I pay the student loan.

398
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,320
I thought it was cute.
I took the last one out.

399
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,200
The Twenty six,
25 the minimum.

400
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,180
Fuck you.
I've done a couple of people.

401
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,700
They showed up about three years ago.
Dog with a big old number.

402
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:10,050
I had to get an attorney to negotiate it
down and get off at the irs.

403
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,080
I didn't pay taxes from 90 to 2001 was 
talking.

404
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,270
I was crazy.
I was hiding.

405
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:19,220
I was doing.
What was that?

406
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:21,060
Making 8,000
years of road common.

407
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,100
Yeah.
What am I going to file?

408
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,610
So I didn't file.
I made money one of the 13 years or 11 

409
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,440
years and one day I walked in downtown 
downtown that we're going to shoot me in

410
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,570
that.
I took a number.

411
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,490
They called my name.
I went back there.

412
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,290
I told them I hadn't filed them 11 
years.

413
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,530
They asked me what I did.
I talked to a lady for a half hour.

414
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,700
She had.
She goes,

415
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,230
we don't go back for seven,
so you got seven for years.

416
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,560
Now they don't throw you and listen.
You have to be a dumb motherfucker for 

417
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,300
them to throw you in jail or you have to
be a public figure.

418
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,600
They give you every option.
Jonah,

419
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,570
the public figure,
you're actually worse off than if you're

420
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,440
just legitimate businessman.
If you a public thing.

421
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,900
I could go down there with my attorney 
and said,

422
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:08,901
look,
I'm going to shoot 10 movies and the 

423
00:19:08,901 --> 00:19:08,901
next time they wouldn't.
They would not let Wesley snipes do that

424
00:19:08,901 --> 00:19:13,431
because we gave him such a hard.
At first he was telling them all this 

425
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:14,310
shit that FEC rules and fuck the United 
States,

426
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:20,150
Africa,
and he was talking about all that shit 

427
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,180
and that shit drives them crazy.
I don't think he.

428
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,760
He was.
He made a case that he didn't owe them.

429
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,100
You got to go in there humble and 
they'll play with you once you start 

430
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,200
talking about amendment 11,
Thomas Jefferson,

431
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,960
reparations,
Chinese reserves.

432
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,300
Don't give a fuck those people out there
that convinced people that they don't 

433
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,050
have to pay taxes and people want to 
believe it,

434
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,640
like a conspiracy theory.
You know?

435
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,320
It might be,
here's the thing,

436
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,350
you might have a legal argument,
but it doesn't matter.

437
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:54,120
They'll put you in a fuck.
Can't get away.

438
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:59,210
Carriage tax,
evasion that money and put you in a 

439
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,770
fucking cage and you won't make any 
money from fucking the solution.

440
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,870
What's that?
That kid that we miss?

441
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,740
Illusion is that situation.
Whatever his fucking name is.

442
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,420
Let me get a tissue paper from.
Yeah,

443
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,130
he's a nice guy.
He's a really nice guy.

444
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,990
Very nice guy.
Wait,

445
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:16,730
what happened to him?
He tried to.

446
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,460
He actually didn't just not pay his 
taxes.

447
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,610
There were some shenanigans,
contended he made less than he actually 

448
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,290
did get you on why these pete rose's and
they got sinbad,

449
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,470
remember that they were putting them on 
the front page of the La Times for years

450
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,260
wise or dog Mike.
The situation.

451
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,410
More charges.
Yeah.

452
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,080
Coding,
tax evasion and structuring tax evasion.

453
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,600
Like once you structure it and you're 
the mastermind a,

454
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,890
you're definitely going the farm.
The

455
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,040
craziest part of the story was to me 
that for that period that they're like 

456
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,520
hitting them up about he made $9.
Million million dollars.

457
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
So friendly.
No,

458
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,380
I just was amazed that I didn't realize 
that from.

459
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,750
I mean I remember that show obviously a 
huge hit,

460
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:05,260
but that's incredible sum of money.
We should really pay attention to this.

461
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,830
Like not just his but what,
what they can do.

462
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,280
Because you think about what it is is 
we're just talking about money.

463
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:17,281
Right.
And we're talking about some deception 

464
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:17,281
on his part where he tried to keep some 
money.

465
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:19,660
Yeah.
Try to make them look like anybody else.

466
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,620
Yeah.
I say,

467
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:25,621
or you're in some sort of a deal with 
costco and he'd do some sneaky shit and 

468
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:25,621
just that they,
they can sue you,

469
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,660
neil owe them and you have to pay them,
but there's no threat of jail time.

470
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,470
Right,
right.

471
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:30,130
I mean,
is there,

472
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,870
have you tried to like cook the books?
Would they get just what they put you in

473
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:39,871
jail or were they just trying to find 
why fraud a today finds I'm guessing be 

474
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,450
the same kind of scrutiny and attention 
now that he's getting?

475
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,480
No,
I think it'd be all about paying a lot 

476
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:48,480
of money.
Let's,

477
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:48,480
let's put,
let's pretend that Mike Sorrentino,

478
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,290
was that his name?
Let's pretend that he had some sort of a

479
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,020
deal Chevrolet and uh,
you know,

480
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,040
he was using his name to sell cars,
but he was fucking around with some 

481
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,480
money and cooking the books and little 
bit of this,

482
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:01,720
a little bit of that to the same tune as
what was going on with the irs.

483
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,810
What do you think they would do to him?
Would you even be seeing this on TV now?

484
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,610
They would,
yeah.

485
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,600
It'd be like a suit,
right?

486
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Because what they're saying is this guy 
tried to fuck that big daddy,

487
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,890
right?
I mean that's what they're showing you,

488
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,220
showing you that big daddy gets mad when
you try to fuck him.

489
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,280
And in the grand scheme of things like 
in a lot of money for an individual to 

490
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,280
earn,
but it's,

491
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,760
you know,
it's not money that affects big daddy.

492
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,580
Daddy's coming after you.
But here's the strange thing,

493
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,780
big daddy is just people like,
well,

494
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,500
why don't we let anything be big daddy?
Like the,

495
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,960
I,
we used to think of it I think from like

496
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:37,450
almost like a primitive perspective.
Like you have a king,

497
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,820
you know,
or you have a leader of a tribe.

498
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:45,150
I think that's,
that's how people used to think of it 

499
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,150
and used to think of all these 
organizations,

500
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,440
whether it's the FBI or the dea as being
a part of that,

501
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,520
but there are just a bunch of fucking 
people and no,

502
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:55,521
no person should ever be big daddy to 
the point where if you have money that's

503
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,960
owed to someone else,
perhaps there's some sort of an argument

504
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:03,250
that you've been deceptive that they can
just swoop down and take all your money.

505
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,760
Like they lock it all up like they're 
go,

506
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:05,930
no,
no,

507
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:06,130
no,
no.

508
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,430
We're fucking freezing your funds.
Like Exxon doesn't get to do that.

509
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,730
Chevy doesn't get to do that over other 
corporations don't get to do that,

510
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:17,620
but big daddy has the overall say if you
violate big daddy's code,

511
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,040
even though big daddy like you don't 
need you to get a receipt from,

512
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,990
from big Daddy,
big daddy,

513
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:26,650
half your money and big daddy just takes
it and spends as fuck.

514
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:29,460
You want to whatever the fuck they want.
And you know,

515
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,860
you said you don't pay taxes.
You fucking hippie.

516
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,450
What are you a Bernie Sanders supporter?
Not even saying that,

517
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,440
not even saying that,
I think,

518
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,080
don't you think big data should be 
accountable if big daddy's gonna be able

519
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:43,081
to just throw us in a cage because we 
don't give him ones and zeroes don't 

520
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:44,490
think big daddy should be a little bit 
accountable.

521
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,190
Should be way accountable for their 
spending

522
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,900
way more accountable.
Hey,

523
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,640
you shouldn't just,
you should be able to check off boxes 

524
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,551
to.
There should be like still like needs 

525
00:23:57,551 --> 00:23:58,790
like healthcare check,
like a police department,

526
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,810
check fire department check things that 
you.

527
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,460
We all like have to pay and then there 
should be elective things.

528
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,890
A bunch of elective shit.
You know,

529
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:12,730
I feel like they should also like our 
representatives should be way more 

530
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,871
willing and like actually like mandated 
to explain in detail and like what 

531
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:19,990
they're doing,
what they're spending on it.

532
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,940
I feel like a lot of,
you know,

533
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,340
house represent Congress Senate.
There's just like an air of arrogance 

534
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,100
about the way that they even handle 
them.

535
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,330
You know what I mean?
They have power.

536
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,940
Of course they are big daddy,
big daddy and like it's.

537
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:36,941
Yeah,
I mean it's just like aloofness that 

538
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:36,941
they have is like,
it's always been upsetting to him.

539
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:41,750
It's fucking gross.
No one should be big daddy and you mean 

540
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,780
the,
the people in Congress should be humble 

541
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:45,780
and you know,
that's one of the things about Obama.

542
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,080
Say what you want about Obama,
whether you liked his policies as a 

543
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,831
human being.
That guy conducted himself better than 

544
00:24:53,831 --> 00:24:54,650
any president ever.
The way he spoke,

545
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:59,720
the way he interacted with people,
the way he even responded to criticism,

546
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,770
you know,
we're not just talking,

547
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:03,500
I'm not talking about his policies and 
you might hate to clap for them,

548
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,640
be as good as it's ever been,
which is why this trump thing is in such

549
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:11,540
direct contrast.
When he's yelling the other day,

550
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:13,240
it's some reporter and he said,
uh,

551
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,660
you know,
you're fake news.

552
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:15,950
He used that again.
Oh Man.

553
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:16,760
He said,
be quiet.

554
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:19,850
Fake news or something like that.
We're talking about something,

555
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,560
you know,
we can conflate the two,

556
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,580
like if you want to take,
talk about policy and effectiveness of 

557
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,170
it administration and just personal 
conduct.

558
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,540
Like let's say you take all the politics
out of it.

559
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,870
That's what bothers a lot of people to 
this moment still if you just even 

560
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:39,311
separate politics,
which a lot of people are in favor of 

561
00:25:39,311 --> 00:25:39,830
just the way he conducts himself.
Some people love it.

562
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,030
Listen,
let's be honest.

563
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:43,520
So it's very,
very small amount of people love it,

564
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,610
but a lot of people are on president.
Yeah,

565
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,620
yeah,
yeah.

566
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,820
You were saying before there's no 
debtor's prison.

567
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,550
Yeah,
there's no debtor's prison.

568
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,250
When I first got into comedy,
I was getting divorced.

569
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:58,590
I was getting squeezed by an attorney 
and as much as i.

570
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,720
I never forget the first day,
I haven't missed sending a payment or 

571
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,230
anything.
Like I'll never forget how sugar that my

572
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:11,231
credit rating and everything.
I worked all those years going down the 

573
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:12,620
toilet and then at that point is if I'm 
walking on nights,

574
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:13,580
I might as well dance.

575
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,960
I mean I was just buying cars and 
fucking around and know what.

576
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,980
They couldn't throw me in jail for all 
that shit,

577
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:22,640
but one discovery closed my account.
Yeah.

578
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:24,530
And I went home and opened up my drone.
One of those,

579
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,060
because when you,
when you want coke,

580
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:29,270
you get fucking Einstein,
creative Jack.

581
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,810
I went home and I opened the drawer and 
I saw all those checks.

582
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,790
Those three checks with discover sends 
you.

583
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,520
When you first went to card,
get the card.

584
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,380
I had a bank account to Bank of Boulder 
or whatever it was called.

585
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,500
I had my back,
my car finance through that.

586
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:43,980
I

587
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,140
wouldn't have had a 24 hour drive 
through.

588
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,620
I wouldn't at 1:00
and signed that check over to myself for

589
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:54,621
a thousand.
I waited for two seconds and all of a 

590
00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:55,590
sudden envelope came out with a 100 with
10 hundreds.

591
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:01,250
I peeled them,
did 90 out of the discover call,

592
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,840
said you got an hour to bring that 
fucking money back or we're going to 

593
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,180
charge you with fraud.
And I was put up against the thing.

594
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:14,181
I went to the bank.
I told them it was a mistake I didn't 

595
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:14,340
know and one lady said,
you know what?

596
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,720
I'll take that thousand dollars.
I will give you the thousand,

597
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,730
but I'm going to put it into your car 
loan and raise the payments by 25 bucks 

598
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,120
for every thousand dollars,
25 bucks,

599
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,080
and that's the only reason why I didn't 
go to jail for that fucking thing.

600
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,740
So they don't put you in jail for being 
in debt.

601
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,580
They put you in jail for deception.
You know how they get athletes and 

602
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,181
entertainers.
You know what that biggest downfall is 

603
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:42,750
when they go to comic cons and those 
autograph signings.

604
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,460
Oh they don't.
They don't get paid for.

605
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:46,200
Those are they get paid for those don't 
report.

606
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:49,670
There's two things.
There's the people who get $5,000

607
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,720
flat and you take pictures all day.
Then there's the people that get $10 for

608
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:59,160
their tee shirt and $15 for a headshot 
and a smile.

609
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,220
Yep.
Those 15 that I was going in your 

610
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,220
pocket,
Bro.

611
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,950
You know what I'm saying?
And what happens is you have to give a 

612
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,131
percentage to that $15 to the guy.
It's like when you sell a merchant at a 

613
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:14,131
comedy club,
now all of a sudden now they want 80 

614
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:14,131
percent of your merchant.
Same thing.

615
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:16,140
Well that guy reports it,
but pete rose.

616
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:18,710
I'm just saying Pete Rose,
I have nothing against Rosie.

617
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,730
My dog,
Pete rose.

618
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,050
We just put $15 in his pocket,
right?

619
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,000
What?
$60 or he took 10 pictures.

620
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:32,001
It's $150.
That's how they get you on all those 

621
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,570
autograph things.
What's going on here?

622
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,620
What's this is from an article.
That's what he's talking about.

623
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:43,110
This article is talking about walking 
away from comic con with garbage bags 

624
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,221
full of twenties.
This guy said he can make up to 250 

625
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:49,671
grand shit twice.
They didn't feel a need for 

626
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:50,160
representation because he's walking out 
with a bag full of cash.

627
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,210
What?
Who is he?

628
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,580
It's like an unnamed person.
He's a source.

629
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:58,581
Deeply involved.
The Steven Arnelle who became so 

630
00:28:58,581 --> 00:28:58,780
enhanced the festival business that he 
started his talent.

631
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,760
Talented.
You see the Arrow to show the arrow.

632
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,310
Oh,
okay.

633
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,590
Comic book show on Netflix.
Wow.

634
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,920
That's a lot of money.
Fuck,

635
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:10,500
that seems very strange.
Comic Con,

636
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:15,501
you pay for a booth and then I think 
you've given me three percent of the 

637
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:15,501
overall take.
Don't you think?

638
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:18,900
That's really bizarre.
Having people pay to come and meet you.

639
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,420
That seems weird.
Strange.

640
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,470
I think it's weird to charge somebody 
for a picture and,

641
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,750
and charge somebody to sign.
I mean,

642
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,550
I guess the signing thing,
I understand there's a bit,

643
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:30,790
especially in sports,
you know,

644
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,480
business selling a book,
but um,

645
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,380
or visa or thing that you're signing 
$500,000

646
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:42,381
a weekend.
Who the fuck gets that from the walking 

647
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:42,820
dead?
Norman Reedus $200,000

648
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,880
guarantee to back guarantee p 500 grand 
a weekend follow celebrities will get a 

649
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:52,330
flat and the ones that are the way real 
low,

650
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,710
like if you want Lucille Ball,
like if you want happy days or something

651
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,570
like that,
they get piecework.

652
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,550
I just changed my mind.
I'm all in doing the next weekend.

653
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
I'm taking pictures with your mom,
your kid,

654
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,100
you would never do this.
Joe Rogan,

655
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,480
like the other day,
a friend of mine called me and he goes,

656
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:15,040
I was at my dad's hospital room the 
other day and it was the funniest thing.

657
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,580
Joe Rogan,
a young Joe Rogan sitting around a 

658
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:20,580
campfire with people.
He goes,

659
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,261
I never saw that episode,
and all of a sudden he pulls out a bag 

660
00:30:25,261 --> 00:30:25,840
of dicks and he made every believer.
He dixie goes,

661
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:28,360
me and my dad would fucking Howard,
you know,

662
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:31,750
for some people in 10 years they're 
going to come to you and say,

663
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,180
can I get to take a picture for $10?

664
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,930
I love the fact that we.
And you're sit back on one picture now.

665
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,830
I understand.
I think it's a bad relationship.

666
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,250
It is,
but some people when they go to Comicon,

667
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:50,330
yeah,
they take their whole savings out there 

668
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:50,330
ready to go.
Now I'm sure I understood the shame.

669
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,650
I understand the chain,
but I can make a living.

670
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,450
What are you gonna do?
I don't have any problem with it.

671
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,660
I don't have any problem.
People do want to make a living know who

672
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,530
I was.
Just saying.

673
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:01,450
That's how you get nailed.
That's how they nail you.

674
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,150
Don't get that.
Could you see yourself doing that?

675
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,160
Talking to them back.
That's what I'm saying.

676
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,330
Listen,
when I was a coke fiend,

677
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:10,320
like sell cds after a show.
So what,

678
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,040
what does that tell you?
Why I couldn't yet.

679
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,110
I have to embarrass.
Wow.

680
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,280
I have a hard time.

681
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:20,280
I'd rather shake your hand and hug you.
I can get the fuck out then you not come

682
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:23,100
up to me because I'm selling a $25 seat 
there.

683
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,120
Yeah,
that's a funny thing about you joey.

684
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:25,910
You know?
Uh,

685
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,020
I've,
I've been friends with a lot of guys 

686
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,241
that had substance abuses.
Like I told you about my friend Johnny 

687
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:36,360
back in New York.
And one thing that you both had in 

688
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,140
common is that even though you have like
these issues,

689
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:43,170
there was never a point where I felt 
like I couldn't trust you with 

690
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:43,860
something.
You know,

691
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,050
like I,
you,

692
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,950
you never would sell anybody out.
You would never,

693
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:48,800
you know what I'm saying?
Like,

694
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,950
you know,
you're not a type of person who would do

695
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:55,951
something to hurt somebody else so that 
you could profit because you were sick 

696
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:57,420
and you needed drugs.
That was never you.

697
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,010
You always had like a strong code of 
ethics.

698
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,900
Get out that you were worth nothing.
I was a jam that had problems,

699
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,590
but when are we started telling people 
he's a junkie but he pays his bills.

700
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,050
Will you?
Will you know like,

701
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:16,051
what the fuck are you talking about?
You're just a guy struggling in and I 

702
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:20,940
recognized he knew a lot of what I had 
seen in my friend Johnny was that 

703
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,441
there's a lot of people that are 
brilliant people that for some reason 

704
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:29,160
the fabric of society just doesn't fit.
That just is.

705
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:34,350
There's something about getting up in 
the morning and go into a job and you 

706
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,401
know,
whatever it is about the way they were 

707
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:40,021
raised to experiences they had,
just who they are inherently from 

708
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:40,021
whatever the

709
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:44,980
factors are there.
Certain people that just can't do the 

710
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,550
regular thing and they just need to find
this other thing for you is obviously 

711
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,390
stand up and once you found that other,
the thing and became successful,

712
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:53,810
that other thing,
that's when your whole thing changed.

713
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,040
That's when you were.
I mean,

714
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,110
it was really proved positive.
I mean for sure.

715
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:59,300
You learned a lot of things about life.
You got older,

716
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:00,890
you get wiser,
you know,

717
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:05,891
but I think a big part of you becoming 
more comfortable and more relaxed and 

718
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:11,111
becoming who you are today is that you,
you started becoming successful as a 

719
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:14,750
comedian.
And when you started becoming successful

720
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:15,520
as a comedian,
like,

721
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,310
like,
well,

722
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,460
10 years ago things started really 
ramping up for Ya.

723
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,870
Uh,
noticeable,

724
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:24,200
relaxing,
a few noticeable change because you,

725
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,550
you,
you realize like,

726
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,650
oh,
this is what I'm supposed to be doing.

727
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,070
The problem is when this isn't working.
And then you think,

728
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:32,780
well,
maybe I should go back to selling cars.

729
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,520
Or maybe I should get a job in a 
factory.

730
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:39,550
Maybe I should.
Maybe I should do something a three or 

731
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:39,550
four nights a week.
Just bartend.

732
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:44,110
Make a little extra money,
lighten up the load on the family that 

733
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,370
when those types of things start fucking
with you and that's when you start doing

734
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:48,410
coke.
That's when you start going crazy.

735
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,140
That's when you stay up late.
That's when you fuck off.

736
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:53,990
That's when you make big mistakes.
Like you're unhappy,

737
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:56,540
you're upset,
you're in the wrong groove.

738
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:01,630
It wasn't the external struggles as much
as the internal struggle or maybe all of

739
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,730
it together.
No violent this November,

740
00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:08,350
so it'd be 10 years.
I haven't done a lot of coke and coffee.

741
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,080
It's amazing

742
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:14,210
with you.
The January after the November and 

743
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:18,040
you're like,
you haven't done it in 60 days and that 

744
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,040
was still.
I wasn't sweating it out.

745
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,620
Yeah,
but I still wasn't trusting myself.

746
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,690
Right.
I thought I could snap at any minute,

747
00:34:21,691 --> 00:34:26,691
some chicklet hot pits with a gram of 
coke or whatever,

748
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:34,150
but you gotta remember Bro.
For me it wasn't about success or or 

749
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:40,641
selling tickets or for me it was just 
doing something with my life where I've 

750
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:45,470
come from.
All I wanted was just to do something 

751
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,020
with my life.
If I could pay rent,

752
00:34:46,021 --> 00:34:49,080
feed the cats,
smoke pot and do spots,

753
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,210
that's a lot better than what I used to 
do.

754
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,520
Yeah.
That's how a lot better than when the 

755
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,090
life I had you understand that even if I
don't go on the road and I'm not Louis,

756
00:34:57,091 --> 00:34:57,740
c,
k,

757
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:02,770
it didn't matter to me.
Just that I didn't have to carry a gun 

758
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,050
or worry about people knocking on my 
door.

759
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,600
I was like Richard Gere and Austin's 
gentlemen.

760
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:11,630
I had nowhere else to go to the store 
and do that stupid spot at 12,

761
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:15,300
45 and look what happened.
You just keep showing up.

762
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,230
Yeah man,

763
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:21,500
there was a big part of it,
but another big part of it was getting 

764
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:21,500
you on the Internet.
That was the thing.

765
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,500
So we get a chance to show people what I
already knew.

766
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,710
You know,
with like the only way for you back then

767
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,530
to get exposure was you had to do 
something conventional.

768
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:35,650
The only thing that existed,
they had to put you in a movie or put 

769
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:35,650
you in a TV show and you got an a few 
movies,

770
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,340
movies and you got an a few TV shows,
but they didn't get to see you as Joey d

771
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,420
and c,
but they got to cut some fucking 

772
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,140
character actor and you know that mob 
movie with Robert De Niro.

773
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,720
But there's a big difference between 
that and you like this.

774
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,490
You just took the.
Took the right thing for you to be this.

775
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:58,570
You took like the Internet,
but the Internet has like for Joey is 

776
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,080
the best medium ever.

777
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,330
Yeah,
for sure.

778
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:03,000
It was exploded.
Well for you to know it's gone.

779
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,870
Yeah.
Yeah,

780
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,770
for sure.
Like it.

781
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:10,140
I like it.
You're just as good of an example.

782
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,470
Like you don't have a lot of success 
outside of the Internet.

783
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,040
No,
that's true.

784
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,500
The Internet has been your shit man.
I mean think about it.

785
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:21,501
You didn't have like a long running 
television series or a series of movies 

786
00:36:21,501 --> 00:36:22,980
or anything you do,
but you're selling out places that a lot

787
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:27,330
of those guys can't even fuck with all 
the time because of your podcast,

788
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:30,630
which is if you haven't seen it,
it's your podcast with your wife.

789
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:34,410
It's one of my favorite podcasts.
It's so fucking consistently silly.

790
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:39,090
That is so ridiculous and people get 
silly when they get on it.

791
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:42,720
They do and then you know,
I start seeing things like,

792
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,580
oh,
this is like your mom's house bit.

793
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:45,920
I need to send it to Tom.
Yeah,

794
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,160
you sent me a couple of good ones.

795
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:52,630
I can tell a story about taking this 
shit without 90 people hitting me up the

796
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,980
next day telling me that was the most 
brilliant story in the world.

797
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:57,920
We're going to send it to Tom.
Tom.

798
00:36:57,921 --> 00:36:59,790
I tell her shit.
Shit comic.

799
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,030
It's awesome.
Bought myself something.

800
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,490
Discussed two days later.
Sure enough,

801
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,760
I'm the fucking youtube videos.
Played Joey telling shit stories for 

802
00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:16,571
sure and he told us about when he shit 
in his backyard and somebody thought it 

803
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:20,370
was got the lady she leave.
She will let her dogs out everyday and 

804
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,940
she would clean up.
They will French poodles dogs.

805
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,700
It was just as high up in the air,
just reeling back from this shit,

806
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,630
this shit.
Joe Rogan.

807
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:41,631
She looked at it and she was like 58.
So she's squinting at this shit up 

808
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:46,631
against the wall.
I took a shit and I put my back against 

809
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:46,700
the wall.

810
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,130
So when I shift,
when you shit outside,

811
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,490
it's not going to be a decent shit.
It's going to be like explosive.

812
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:58,410
So when I got up it looks like somebody 
got shot in the head that we should all 

813
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,730
behind me.
So she's sitting there with a little 

814
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,650
French poodles,
Chihuahuas and she's looking at the wall

815
00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:04,760
like,
what the fuck happened?

816
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:09,761
Then all of a sudden she actually walks 
up to close to it and squint and look at

817
00:38:10,151 --> 00:38:14,090
it and looks around and runs it.
I'm watching all this.

818
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:19,210
I can't breathe.
And now I go to the computer because my 

819
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,421
wife's very decent sitting there for 
half and then my wife comes in and she 

820
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:23,930
goes,
were you home all day today?

821
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:25,510
I go,
yeah,

822
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,030
why?
She goes,

823
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:27,680
I just had a conversation with Susan.

824
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,150
She wanted to know if you heard anything
in the back yard.

825
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:40,090
Then I went to get Sushi,
but give it a go get Sushi.

826
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:41,710
I eat a lot of it.
Hey,

827
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,310
the rice pushes everything out.
Yeah.

828
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,500
You had plans to go get a weed store.
You will go to the post office.

829
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,780
But I made a detour.
I plan to go home,

830
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:53,290
but I left the house key in the house so
I had to climb around the window.

831
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,160
That's what happened.
Yeah.

832
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:55,960
Yeah.
So when I pulled myself up,

833
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,560
I actually landed with my stomach on the
window and now you've made it push it 

834
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:07,141
out more like fuck.
And my hands are struggling in the 

835
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:11,581
window and my feet are on the other side
and the cat's scratching at me.

836
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,570
Right.
And I might get to me.

837
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,800
So I ran out,
ran down the stairs,

838
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:21,520
shit outside.
Oh my God.

839
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:26,850
Nobody took a shit in favor in his 
backyard after a five hour drive from 

840
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,120
Colton or some weird town and not talk 
to you.

841
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:31,580
After that for awhile I took a shit and 
then he ran over.

842
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:34,380
It was called backyard.
Smelled like sewage.

843
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,110
He goes,
it smells back here.

844
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:44,111
Let's walk in the house.
I don't know what happened and you can 

845
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:46,840
see the brown shit.
He smashed it with this tire and a bunch

846
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:51,841
of flyers or talked to me for a month 
after that shit in somebody's backyard 

847
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,600
because I told him the truth.
I felt bad.

848
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,010
That's hard to clean up.
Yeah.

849
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,720
Shit,
dog shit.

850
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:09,550
It doesn't even make you gag like human 
shit.

851
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:11,800
Bomb Shit to clean up some wine.
Oh Shit.

852
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:13,590
If you had to use one of those scrapers.
Yeah.

853
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,580
It smells so much stronger,
man.

854
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,030
It's so much.
No,

855
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:17,340
no,
no.

856
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,440
When you kick a shit until you cut it in
half when that.

857
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,040
When that reese's peanut butter fume 
leaks out.

858
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,240
Oh my God.
He's like,

859
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,530
I've done studies.
When you go to jail,

860
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:36,610
when you,
when you go to prison you have to cut 

861
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,680
the shit,
the shit like in the tube,

862
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,990
but people watching TV,
like when you go to county jail you shit

863
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:45,991
right there.
So black guys will be laying there 

864
00:40:45,991 --> 00:40:49,141
watching TV with their feet up and also 
this little shit and they're like put 

865
00:40:49,141 --> 00:40:52,960
some water in that whole motherfucking 
like they'll just yell at the other side

866
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:55,360
of the fucking prison because that means
you,

867
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,650
you took a shit and just sitting there.

868
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,910
So imprisoned as soon as you shit you 
got to put water on it.

869
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:06,710
Yeah.
But then some bathrooms that only give 

870
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,900
you 20 ounces of water a day.
So whatever time you flush,

871
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:10,930
it's got to be a good flush.
You follow me.

872
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,940
So sometimes the pis has to stay there 
until the next day until you take a good

873
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:18,670
good shit.
But when you take a shit in jail bro,

874
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:23,671
that's what they'll tell you because of 
water with some hole in that 

875
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:23,890
motherfucking old dog.
I could smell that shit.

876
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:28,240
Right now I'm trying to watch oprah,
but that's what smells.

877
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:33,270
One stuff sucks.
It's like when you go to Vegas to have 

878
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,040
that sucking action.
If took the ship is

879
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,040
big.
That's 34 inches once it breaks and it 

880
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,450
looks like two new jobs.
Once that breaks,

881
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,870
it's over.
It's over.

882
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:43,640
And they put the bathroom right by the 
door.

883
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,610
The front entrance?
Yeah.

884
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:47,750
That have nobody come over.
That's why I always go downstairs,

885
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,640
take shit.
I don't Shit in my bathroom,

886
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:52,190
in the hotel no more because it kills 
the whole room for two hours.

887
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:54,880
We worked at the House of Blues in Vegas
and uh,

888
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,040
Joey left a,
an onshore shit.

889
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,560
You know what onshore shit is like,
he,

890
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:06,570
he was so fat at the time that he 
couldn't sit down and like the regular 

891
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:06,570
toilet.
You were like,

892
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,990
what were you four slash 15?
He was giant.

893
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,330
Giant.
So when he would take a shit,

894
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,360
he would had have to balance himself 
mostly on the very edge of the front 

895
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:22,340
because his ass was so big.
Wide Shit in the water on the deck.

896
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,150
No.
Oh,

897
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,580
so you ain't never seen shit like that 
before.

898
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,250
So you couldn't sit in the toilet.
I would sit on the toilet,

899
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:34,220
but I don't like the ad.
It wasn't that I was fat.

900
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,740
I don't like my dick inside the toilet.
Right.

901
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,930
Suck his dick and off the toilet.
I tell my wife,

902
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,340
don't even let my wife be in public 
because I want to eat her monkey.

903
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:45,400
I don't want that monkey touching the 
other thing.

904
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:50,940
So when I shit in a public bathroom,
I hope my balls and I shit towards the 

905
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:55,421
edge.
I don't give a fuck in somebody else's 

906
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:55,421
backyard.
So your soul,

907
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:59,150
your balls and sit where you are because
none of them to move forward because if 

908
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:04,331
I'm back there,
I got grabbed one time sitting on the 

909
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,721
toilet.
They'll jump from that toilet inward 

910
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:10,490
like they jumping over a month.
People who are saying they got crabs to 

911
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:10,490
the toilet isn't an excuse.

912
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:15,280
Well,
sometimes you can create crabs from 

913
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:15,280
anywhere,
but why they it take it from here?

914
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,880
They only cleaned the hairs.
I don't think they're like little stay 

915
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:18,880
on an actual toilet.
I think probably.

916
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:18,880
Definitely.
Right?

917
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:23,980
Yeah.
I would feel like that's one of the 

918
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,331
things about crabs.
I took a shot at the gas station that 

919
00:43:25,331 --> 00:43:26,060
had to be at.
That's what I haven't figured it was.

920
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,550
I'm sorry.
I always hold my shit.

921
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,730
My Shit.
It was long and red band.

922
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:34,160
Put Ketchup on it.
Remember red band?

923
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,670
We'll catch up.
Unfortunately.

924
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,150
I think that was a different time.
Okay.

925
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:42,470
This is not happening.
It has been many,

926
00:43:42,471 --> 00:43:47,471
many times.
Things just like sticking out of go in 

927
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:47,471
there.
There's a smell.

928
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:49,730
You know how when you take an epic shit,
it's an above water shit.

929
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:54,731
It comes out like,
like the fucking big island of Hawaii 

930
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:54,920
just rises through the water.

931
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:00,220
Like I've done that many times because I
eat too much now and I'll take these 

932
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,420
shifts that are just so big.
They're preposterous,

933
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:07,660
but there's a totally different smell to
those shits because you're smelling raw 

934
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,780
shit outside of the water.
I mean it's,

935
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:13,781
it's,
it's gone through the water and it's 

936
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:16,421
poking into the wrong.
What is it about that that makes you 

937
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:20,501
happy?
What is it about the sense of 

938
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:20,501
accomplishment?
First of all,

939
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:21,070
here's a good one,
right?

940
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,240
It doesn't come around that often 
either.

941
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,220
Yeah,
man.

942
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:26,690
It's like a comment like and it just 
like,

943
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:28,190
I don't.
This doesn't happen all the time.

944
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,320
It's always diarrhea too.
It's never like.

945
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,380
It's never like a super thick law.
It's weird when the second wave is 

946
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,950
diarrhea.
Like when you take a shit,

947
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,840
you're proud of yourself and then you're
like,

948
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:40,890
I think I got a little more in there.

949
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:41,930
And it's like,
God,

950
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,020
it's just a fucking,
you know,

951
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,660
that's from what healthy eating,
healthy eating does that.

952
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,540
Yeah.
If you eat some mct oil or coconut oil,

953
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:54,360
lubes up your pipes because where I 
moved to them and have the office to 

954
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,550
back office and it's connected to a 
backroom.

955
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:58,890
It's got a door so I don't live with 
distinct no more.

956
00:44:58,891 --> 00:45:01,900
I opened the door in the morning with 
backyard.

957
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,130
I shit.
I smoked a bowl backyard anymore.

958
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,370
No,
no,

959
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:07,740
no.
My dog goes faces to the backyard.

960
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,340
I had my own bathroom and the bedroom.
Then don't put a woman through one of 

961
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:16,580
your shit's back there.
Yeah.

962
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,450
Leave her alone.
Opened the back door.

963
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,390
Fuck the fuck.
I just opened the back door.

964
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,550
This is school behind their kids 
playing.

965
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,110
I'm shitting and smoking dope.
I don't give a freshman as fuck.

966
00:45:27,111 --> 00:45:27,780
I just don't smell.

967
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,190
And then I'm like,
light a candle.

968
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:30,870
That's beautiful.
Beautiful.

969
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,850
That's what you need is a bathroom with 
a door that faces out.

970
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:40,010
The worst is when you go over a girl's 
house and you go to use your bathroom 

971
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:40,460
and you smell matches.
Oh yeah.

972
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,150
Oh No.
She was lightened.

973
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:47,190
This motherfucker up tall.
You're thinking about burdening her off 

974
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,460
fumes.
Yeah,

975
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,560
the stinky.
But thinking about her math.

976
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,860
You ever get to a girl's place and then 
you feel the gurgles and you're like,

977
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,400
read one.
I could.

978
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,540
I've had that before.
I was dating a girl once.

979
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,140
She had ferocious diarrhea.
Ferocious.

980
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:09,290
So she was in regular time.
So she went to the bathroom and she just

981
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:13,710
turned on the shower and she turns on 
both things on the sink.

982
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,210
Whoa.
Yeah.

983
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,860
And just see what she tried to drown it 
out.

984
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,170
I'm like,
what the fuck is going on?

985
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:24,170
I was very young at the time.
It didn't understand what was super 

986
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:24,270
confused.
The fuck is going on in there.

987
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:29,510
I had,
I had once in college where I was at 

988
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:29,730
this girl's place and she was just like,
Hey,

989
00:46:29,731 --> 00:46:31,230
it's game on,
like go for it,

990
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:36,310
right?
Like I have to take and I could feel 

991
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:36,310
that it was a diarrhea,
explosive diarrhea shit.

992
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,890
And I also realized there was no way to 
do it that,

993
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:43,530
that it would just be a black toilet and
there's no way I could cover.

994
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:45,900
So you know what I did?
I went back to my place,

995
00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:46,540
I was like,
I'll,

996
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,950
I'll see you some other time or 
whatever.

997
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,630
And the next day her friends like,
you're like the fucking,

998
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,660
like they gave me credit,
let that guy that I was a good because 

999
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:56,820
they were like,
you're awesome.

1000
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:57,360
And I was like,
no,

1001
00:46:57,361 --> 00:47:02,361
I had to take my girls because they're 
not getting fucked and they don't want 

1002
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:02,670
their friend to get fucked.

1003
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,500
Right.
So they used reverse psychology on you.

1004
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,450
You're an amazing guy.
I got an amazing guy.

1005
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:10,170
Credit help you wait forever.
A cycle that you left out.

1006
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:11,760
Even when you get married,
tell her,

1007
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:16,290
get married to have sex after you're 
married.

1008
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,730
Never.
It's not about that.

1009
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:23,060
It's about real love.
If I had had bows that were intact,

1010
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,660
it would have been a different story 
that night.

1011
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,730
But bowels.
Bowels.

1012
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

1013
00:47:27,991 --> 00:47:32,710
There's a time when you know that it's 
in the sensitivity of your inner asshole

1014
00:47:32,711 --> 00:47:33,840
region.
Amazing.

1015
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:35,020
It is.
It knows.

1016
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:36,850
Especially when you go to seep out a 
Fart,

1017
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,000
right?
When you're about to cut a fart and then

1018
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:41,580
also the alarms start going off.
You're like,

1019
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,690
oh no.
Oh yeah.

1020
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:44,260
Oh No,
you've got to clamp shot.

1021
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,460
You're like,
Jesus,

1022
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:50,461
what is this?
We were having this debate yesterday 

1023
00:47:50,461 --> 00:47:51,850
about why are they sometimes hot,
like why is it hot and then why does.

1024
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,950
Why do you know that hot is going to 
smell bad?

1025
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:56,230
Spicy food bro is the.
But is that what it is?

1026
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,000
Solely?
I don't know.

1027
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,810
I was telling you guys at one time my 
freshman year,

1028
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:03,340
I didn't take your ship for a week and a
half.

1029
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,590
I was addicted.
This fake

1030
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,030
to how long is that?

1031
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:17,610
I was in when I was five.
I played freshman ball and we were 

1032
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,020
playing paterson eastside.
Wait,

1033
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:24,130
just a jungle over school.
Like you got to be careful when you're 

1034
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,690
going there and we went there to play 
the Christmas tournament.

1035
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,400
Well,
what kind of ball are we talking right 

1036
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,771
now?
Basketball and I hadn't taken a shift 

1037
00:48:34,771 --> 00:48:34,771
for like 10 days.
I was something.

1038
00:48:34,771 --> 00:48:37,070
I took acid,
something fucked my thought until nobody

1039
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,760
in those days I was really scared of 
doctors and I wouldn't say shit to 

1040
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:42,760
nobody.
Way Home.

1041
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,880
We got on the bus and while we will 
wait,

1042
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,970
their stomach started hurting and I 
said,

1043
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:52,910
Jesus Christ,
I don't know if I'm going to shit myself

1044
00:48:52,911 --> 00:48:55,010
a Fart,
but let me just take a chance.

1045
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,220
Good move.
And I blew this far.

1046
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,930
Joe Rogan.
That was so bad,

1047
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:05,670
right?
We want a bus and people started 

1048
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:05,670
running.
You know the school buses.

1049
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:09,690
People started running into the wind 
goes right to swing down the bus 

1050
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:10,450
windows,
but here's what it gets better.

1051
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:11,510
I father again,

1052
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,190
teachers would go,
oh my God,

1053
00:49:14,191 --> 00:49:19,191
he's changing flavors,
but what's the worst thing was the 

1054
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:25,881
cheerleaders are crying.
That's how bad they were sitting in 

1055
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:29,390
front of the bus going to.
The teachers yelled,

1056
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,880
Oh my God,
he's changing.

1057
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:37,000
That's how bad parts,
next tee shirt.

1058
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:42,770
He's changing bus.
I'll never forget looking at the 

1059
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,200
cheerleaders were like,
Oh my God,

1060
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,060
we've never smelled like this.
Big fight was fucking God awful.

1061
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:51,630
I wrote a blog about one enjoys farts 
wants because I don't have plain.

1062
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:52,680
Yes.
I think I read.

1063
00:49:52,681 --> 00:49:55,440
That's called happy pills and it was.
I was thinking about.

1064
00:49:55,441 --> 00:49:57,030
I was,
I was looking at this ad,

1065
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:02,990
take this.
I was looking at this ad for 

1066
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:03,170
antidepressants,
some girl,

1067
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:05,350
a field of wheat and shit.
You know those,

1068
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,030
those ads and a good.
I was just thinking about like,

1069
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,100
like what?
You know,

1070
00:50:10,101 --> 00:50:13,470
what depresses people and how crazy 
pills are and how great.

1071
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,460
Oh,
it's still up there.

1072
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:17,160
You can still find it.
Anyway,

1073
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:19,890
at the end of this is really like me.
We're both,

1074
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:23,370
both of us are barbecued.
I don't know what the fuck.

1075
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,800
What do we add?
Some sort of edibles in the beginning.

1076
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:28,060
Lolly pops way in the beginning of

1077
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,650
we were crucified.
Oregon was asleep.

1078
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,630
Yeah,
he was going in and out,

1079
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:36,540
but he wrote on the blog and I don't 
even have to look at the farm.

1080
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:41,860
Was strong.
He's lucky I fought it because it was a 

1081
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,390
lot better than the Antonio banderas 
movie he was watching something to do is

1082
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:47,210
on Antonio banderas moving in.
I don't remember what it was,

1083
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,240
what it was,
but I do remember the lady behind you.

1084
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,780
I will never forget hearing her over the
ear phones.

1085
00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:54,710
Yeah,
I hear.

1086
00:50:55,310 --> 00:51:00,310
Oh my God,
there it is.

1087
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:06,870
Over the salad in my ipod.
I hear a woman in the row behind us cry 

1088
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,150
out.
Oh my God.

1089
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:13,420
I look over at show and he smiles.
There's your fucking happy pill right 

1090
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:13,420
there.
That's your right.

1091
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,630
Antonio banderas it says.
Oh,

1092
00:51:14,631 --> 00:51:16,810
what was it?
Oh yeah.

1093
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,520
Teaching underprivileged youth.
How to salsa.

1094
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,230
Oh,
that's what I was watching.

1095
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,030
I was watching a terrible move.
Terrible.

1096
00:51:23,031 --> 00:51:26,380
We both were and Joey farted.
The fart of all.

1097
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,540
Do you remember?
By the way,

1098
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:33,820
the seat.
You haven't had those parts where you 

1099
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,581
actually feel your leg was jazz.
When you're in a plane and it's going to

1100
00:51:37,101 --> 00:51:38,810
go down,
what's the button you push?

1101
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:44,510
Your seat was seat belted into your 
waist.

1102
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:46,130
My God,
it was terrible,

1103
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,600
but another time I fought.
I used to,

1104
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:54,310
I used to take the number one bus from 
Jersey City to the high school and we 

1105
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:57,500
were on the bus one morning kids and 
there was a guy reading a paper,

1106
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:03,140
I can live to be 100 and never forget 
this reading the daily news and he had a

1107
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:07,610
connector of drool from his lift,
the Daily News,

1108
00:52:07,611 --> 00:52:09,560
and it was a puddle.
He was on heroin.

1109
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:15,790
They would go to Jersey City in those 
days and get Methadone so they would 

1110
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:15,790
take the bus up north with us.

1111
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:19,950
So I'm sitting there,
he's passed the fuck out and the drool 

1112
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,780
is connected to the daily news and this 
guy to be just six inches of public.

1113
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,980
This guy's been passed out for 20 
minutes.

1114
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,410
I point my ass at him.
I'm not sitting behind them.

1115
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:34,130
I'm sitting across from them and I lift 
up my hips a little bit.

1116
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,410
Kept my ass or just point that even if 
it wasn't pointed at him,

1117
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,060
he would ricochet off the chair and go 
straight and through his mouth.

1118
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:47,240
Like he's sitting there and I let a fart
go out.

1119
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,190
Oh,
I could live to be 80.

1120
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:54,420
He lifted his eyes like he went like 
this first,

1121
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,940
like,
man,

1122
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:03,250
who the fuck?
He goes,

1123
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,110
it smells like something.
Went up some of these as and died and me

1124
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,520
and my little buddies were like,
what?

1125
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:14,440
The center will fucking giggling.
He like,

1126
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:19,580
I should beat the fuck out of my.
Oh my God.

1127
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:23,750
Fantastic.

1128
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,160
This is why I hate people.
This is why I hate when I read.

1129
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:41,570
Give me a second.
This is the reason why I ain't read 

1130
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:46,071
posts from people going,
are you singing tonight as blue comedy 

1131
00:53:46,071 --> 00:53:50,340
will come down to the standard feeder in
Friday night and listened to intelligent

1132
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,720
comedy,
fought provoking comedy,

1133
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:59,990
and then I think about it,
how many times I'm 54 years old and at 

1134
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:03,370
night I got a sleep apnea machine on and
there's a little needle in the sleep 

1135
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:05,790
apnea machine because the hall was 
punches and into your fucking mouth.

1136
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:08,970
So there's an escape valve that's the 
size of a needle.

1137
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:14,310
You know how many nights I will sit 
there and be half asleep and I'll need 

1138
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:18,591
the fart and I'll wake up just to see if
I could smell the fucking fart.

1139
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:21,320
Come through that whole you?
Yes.

1140
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,350
If it comes through,
it's a tremendous fault.

1141
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,860
I just wake up my wife like I go on it.
You got it.

1142
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:28,290
Have it.
Like it's that good.

1143
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:33,230
I'm 54 years old.
That always makes me laptops to Gore.

1144
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:38,300
People say to me like,
I love thought provoking collie dog.

1145
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,620
If it makes you laugh.
It's comedy.

1146
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,130
It's comedy.
Stop with the fucking,

1147
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,680
you know,
you almost hospitalized me one time from

1148
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:48,090
laughing so hard.
Like,

1149
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:50,130
I don't know if you remember this.
I'm serious.

1150
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,300
I don't even know if I could tell it.
It was.

1151
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:58,770
It was backstage.
It was backstage at his show.

1152
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,280
We were somewhere and you were like,
how's the wife?

1153
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,680
You and I go,
you go where she.

1154
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,870
And I said,
I said some city in Tennessee,

1155
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:15,350
maybe Knoxville or Nashville,
and you go Nashville 90 six and you 

1156
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:19,470
started the story about working the club
and you're like,

1157
00:55:19,471 --> 00:55:23,190
I just riffed in between shows some 
crazy shit.

1158
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,620
Come chick who's talking?
There was eight people,

1159
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,900
there was 20 people for the first show,
Knoxville.

1160
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,570
It was a comedy zone show.
I have booked it.

1161
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:36,530
Knoxville's a great little fucking town,
like a cute little Tennessee town does 

1162
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:36,790
it?
It's like hip,

1163
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,670
it's,
you know,

1164
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:40,260
like a college town.
So I get down Friday night,

1165
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:41,760
Joe Rogan,
I'm headlining,

1166
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:46,761
I got 38 minutes,
I just moved to La and I signed with 

1167
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:49,110
creative management and they booked 
those wrongs.

1168
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:52,350
So booking me on as Atlanta.
I was just dying.

1169
00:55:52,351 --> 00:55:57,351
Slowed that.
So what they did was they put me in one 

1170
00:55:57,351 --> 00:55:58,030
nighters that paid like two 75 and nine.
They weren't bad.

1171
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,130
Tennessee,
you know,

1172
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,610
and we go to Knoxville for two nights 
and I go in there and you know me,

1173
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:08,690
I'm fucking crazy.
First night I go in there to Friday 

1174
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,320
night,
there's 20 people for the first show and

1175
00:56:10,321 --> 00:56:15,321
there's a girl,
Joe Rogan that's a 12 with a guy that's 

1176
00:56:15,321 --> 00:56:15,321
a four.

1177
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:17,130
Okay.
And it's her birthday,

1178
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,540
you know,
meanwhile through it,

1179
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,820
she just turned 21.
It's a birthday.

1180
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,640
Okay,
happy what's going on here,

1181
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:26,320
you know,
because once you start hearing noise you

1182
00:56:26,321 --> 00:56:28,450
have to react to it as a comment and you
go,

1183
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:29,770
what's going on?
And he was 21.

1184
00:56:29,771 --> 00:56:31,000
I said,
you're very beautiful.

1185
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:36,540
And then she just went and ran with it 
and started talking about how her 

1186
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,610
husband pimps are out.
He would have fights on and for 20 bucks

1187
00:56:39,611 --> 00:56:41,220
you could fuck her in the back room 
twice.

1188
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:46,260
Fights were on whatever.
I don't know that on Fridays he would 

1189
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:50,071
bring it to the construction truck,
a truck with her to the construction 

1190
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:55,690
site and put a mattress in the back and 
at lunchtime he will let her friends and

1191
00:56:55,691 --> 00:57:00,691
she's telling me this.
It's like she's 12 and people like just 

1192
00:57:00,701 --> 00:57:03,070
holding their breasts,
like what is going on here?

1193
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,660
This girl is beautiful and this retarded
just pimping up.

1194
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:11,740
So in between shows,
I go upstairs to do a line of smoke,

1195
00:57:11,741 --> 00:57:16,570
a joint or whatever the fuck I'm doing.
When I come back I see her by herself.

1196
00:57:16,571 --> 00:57:18,370
When we start talking to them about 
what's going on,

1197
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,110
oh my God,
I had such a great time.

1198
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,480
I go,
what's that stuff?

1199
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:23,110
True?
And she goes,

1200
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:24,250
yeah,
I go show me the monkey.

1201
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:27,310
And she me in the woman's bathroom 
pulled down her pants.

1202
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:31,030
The girl had a monkey that was spotless.
She didn't nearly stunk.

1203
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:33,140
I ate it.
I find that some.

1204
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,040
And then she sucked my Dick.
That was it.

1205
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,450
I went back to my room.
I didn't think nothing of it.

1206
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:38,350
I'm like,
Jesus Christ,

1207
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:44,470
I go back for the second show that AP.
But by the time I got back for the 

1208
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:44,470
second show,
Joe Rogan,

1209
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:45,850
she's sitting in the back,
she's doing,

1210
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,110
she's looking at me like this.

1211
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:54,190
She's fucked up and 10 minutes into my 
spot set because I was headlining.

1212
00:57:54,951 --> 00:57:58,160
She starts going,
I sucked the Comedians Dick Tonight.

1213
00:57:58,161 --> 00:57:59,690
And I was like,
what are you talking about?

1214
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,580
And she's like,
I suck this Dick.

1215
00:58:01,581 --> 00:58:02,930
And he came in my mouth,
he's like,

1216
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:08,110
what the fuck are you talking about?
The cops had to hold him back and he's 

1217
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:08,330
like,
I want my $40.

1218
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:13,810
That's all he wanted.
He didn't care his wife Suck my dick at 

1219
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:14,660
this comedy bedroom.
Oh my God.

1220
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:16,160
When the cops came,
he kept saying,

1221
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:18,620
man,
somebody is going to get hurt if I don't

1222
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:21,350
have my $40.
That's a 40 hour blow job.

1223
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:24,230
Did you come in her mouth?
Because if I wouldn't have come,

1224
00:58:24,231 --> 00:58:28,330
it would have been late 20.
Oh he cared about was the $40.

1225
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,030
So he told me that backstage at your 
show.

1226
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:36,890
And I fucking started hyperventilating.
$40 for his wife.

1227
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:42,410
This is the world of comedy,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

1228
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,380
this is the world of crazy fucking 
comedy.

1229
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,490
Jesus.

1230
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:54,630
I think that's crazy why she's crying.
Some of the hugging his wife and said,

1231
00:58:58,741 --> 00:58:59,500
you know,
no,

1232
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,210
he didn't care.
He just wanted the $40 with a blow job.

1233
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,620
I didn't give it to them.
It's got rules.

1234
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:09,000
You've got to give him that.
He's got like a line in the sand.

1235
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:15,310
Mrs Got.
He's got 40 fucking crazy animal when 

1236
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:17,710
you sit at home at night and you think 
about all the shit we were seeing,

1237
00:59:17,711 --> 00:59:20,370
we were learning a lot.
I don't think I've ever laughed as hard.

1238
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:25,470
Well,
that's probably second time right there 

1239
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:25,470
on that road.
We do a lot of things.

1240
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:25,910
You want a lot of things about human 
beings.

1241
00:59:25,911 --> 00:59:27,710
You.
One of the things about individual,

1242
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,460
you learn some grabbing my American 
home.

1243
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,680
It's uh,
uh,

1244
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,090
armed forces place in Idaho.
It's part of the triple rock.

1245
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:39,520
This was,
I walked in and I had to go meet,

1246
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,110
do a sound check her,
but he kept looking at me going,

1247
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:43,460
hi,
how are you?

1248
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,680
Have you met sandy yet?
And I go,

1249
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:48,350
no.
And they go and they can walk away.

1250
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:53,300
You ever see a movie with Eddie Murphy 
when he with Boomerang,

1251
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:58,930
when he goes to the black chicks out 
said to 80 and the Butler keeps 

1252
00:59:58,930 --> 00:59:58,930
laughing.
Remember the Butler would go.

1253
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:04,220
She wants to see in the kitchen.
He would go because she knew he was 

1254
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:04,220
gonna.
She was gonna rape him.

1255
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,310
So every time somebody will refer to 
Shirley,

1256
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,830
they go,
have you met Shirley?

1257
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:10,280
And you go,
no.

1258
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:11,690
And they go,
oh,

1259
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:16,750
and they'd walk away with Shirley,
wherever the capital that base was the 

1260
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,500
head of the base.
She was his wife.

1261
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,210
And if a band came to town or a comedian
came to town,

1262
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,760
she blue.
That's it.

1263
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:30,820
That was the rule.
Like he and he would sit out there with 

1264
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:34,691
his fucking military armed with all his 
shit and class and she'd be in the back 

1265
01:00:34,691 --> 01:00:37,460
color mink because the whole band,
I mean this is crazy.

1266
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:43,600
So I didn't know about this.
She came over and started talking to me 

1267
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:43,600
and then she started telling all your 
Cuban.

1268
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,470
I dated to Cuba one time.
He was such a big thick.

1269
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,420
You have a big thing.
I mean it was that white glove.

1270
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,940
It was quick.
Like she just gets to it.

1271
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,760
She's like 15.
I was maybe like 31.

1272
01:00:52,761 --> 01:00:56,060
She was maybe 50 and she just dropped 
behind the curtain,

1273
01:00:56,090 --> 01:01:01,090
took the hammer out.
I'm sitting there minding my own 

1274
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,190
business and all of a sudden somebody 
comes yelling for Shirley,

1275
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:04,790
Shirley,
Shirley.

1276
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:10,030
Now usually,
surely we get up and stop sucking your 

1277
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:10,030
Dick.
Not Surely.

1278
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:11,960
She moved her knees like I had neon 
belly.

1279
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:14,790
Belly.
He's supposed to move this way.

1280
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:20,350
That's what she did with a nice.
She kept sucking and just kept moving 

1281
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:20,350
this way.
She.

1282
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:21,050
I tried to take it out of her mouth.

1283
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,370
She wouldn't let it.
She's like,

1284
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:22,820
no,
no,

1285
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:23,630
no.
She,

1286
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:29,950
she wouldn't stop until I met Shirley 
out here and this is crazy shit.

1287
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:33,770
I can't.
I'm overstimulated.

1288
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:37,400
I feel like I feel like I need 
psychiatric treatment right now.

1289
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:43,460
We just finished that fucking drink.
My main greatest thing anyone's ever 

1290
01:01:44,391 --> 01:01:47,650
said that is the best word mean kid 
juice.

1291
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:53,590
But boy it's minky.
Ah,

1292
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,740
but when they say they cut it short,
what is the word?

1293
01:01:57,741 --> 01:01:59,150
What does it mean?
Get me,

1294
01:01:59,151 --> 01:02:00,330
suck my Dick.
Mika.

1295
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,800
In the Sukkah.
Right.

1296
01:02:03,801 --> 01:02:04,370
Okay.
You know,

1297
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:08,270
it's so weird how the morning.
This is Italian Sicilian.

1298
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:10,940
Really?
So the deeper you go down to boot,

1299
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:16,480
the more.
Is it closer to Spain or is it farther 

1300
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,120
from spraying?
The closer it Lee is from Spain.

1301
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,340
When people from that area speak

1302
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,860
Italian,
I don't care how fast they're talking,

1303
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,010
they can't put the wool over me because 
I can pick up every four words.

1304
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:31,490
Right.
So Sicilian say Sukkah what's sucking 

1305
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:31,490
Spanish?
Trooper.

1306
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,150
Trooper.
You're in the neighborhood,

1307
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:37,540
right?
So when they say it's like,

1308
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,190
you know what,
what are you gonna do today?

1309
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:41,680
I'm going to go and get my Minka suck.
But sue,

1310
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,470
I mean because just the short second 
shirt of this show.

1311
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,120
So on me.
Sure.

1312
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:53,730
And then you got minka juice comes at 
you where you want it.

1313
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,750
Cheers.
Cheers.

1314
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:03,510
When you,
when you hear those Latin languages like

1315
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:08,690
Spanish and you hear a Italian,
like those languages seem to like feel 

1316
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:12,420
like a let's have fun language.
You know,

1317
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,640
everything has got a thing to it.
It's kind of a rhythm.

1318
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:17,340
There's a way to talk.
It is fun.

1319
01:03:17,341 --> 01:03:18,390
Yeah.
Fun to listen to.

1320
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:19,180
Yeah.

1321
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:23,190
Especially not really knowing anything 
about what they're saying.

1322
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,740
I can pick up like one out of 100 words 
maybe.

1323
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:26,640
Right?
Yeah.

1324
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,170
And so I hear them talking and I'm like,
well,

1325
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,760
when bitcoin was in,
but it's.

1326
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:34,410
So for me it's almost just like hearing 
the rhythm of them talking.

1327
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:39,440
Yeah.
It's like a fun sort of a smooth relax,

1328
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:47,670
but I get you an express or talk to you 
and it's very hard when other gestures,

1329
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,950
hand gestures.
Yeah.

1330
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:53,490
You can always tell when a Latin person 
like across a room.

1331
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:58,610
Yeah.
Just by their hand gestures and they 

1332
01:03:58,610 --> 01:03:58,610
start,
you know,

1333
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:01,350
glad to see me les to see me like this.
Just hearing how long did it take you?

1334
01:04:02,911 --> 01:04:04,350
How long do you think it takes you for 
you?

1335
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:08,010
Just to get the book.
If you're in France for a week?

1336
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,710
Yeah.
Like it takes you three days just to get

1337
01:04:10,711 --> 01:04:13,530
the like I'm not going to learn French 
and three days,

1338
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:16,510
but let's take you three days to get the
Jif.

1339
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:21,780
I wonder like French,
like if they come up to you and ask you 

1340
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:24,870
what you want from the menu.
Like after you go to nine restaurants,

1341
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:27,780
three days he had a little something.
Yeah.

1342
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,570
You get.
Especially if you have like a Latin root

1343
01:04:30,571 --> 01:04:31,160
too though,
you know,

1344
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:36,590
like you're comfortable with it.
Does it ever bother you when you hear 

1345
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:38,450
stories about Americans going to like 
Paris and like,

1346
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:41,190
uh,
the Persians thinking the Americans were

1347
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:46,191
Dicks,
the Americans like acting like assholes 

1348
01:04:46,191 --> 01:04:48,270
to people from Paris.
Like what is that?

1349
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:50,730
Like?
How did that whole room or get started?

1350
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,960
The loud American.
Yeah.

1351
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:56,760
Had that whole like us versus Paris 
thing.

1352
01:04:56,761 --> 01:05:01,761
You remember when they wouldn't call 
things French fries that were calling 

1353
01:05:01,761 --> 01:05:01,830
freedom fries.
Bushier,

1354
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:03,150
right.
Do you remember that?

1355
01:05:03,151 --> 01:05:04,390
Yeah,
like freedom fries.

1356
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,410
It's always like the French,
you know,

1357
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:12,411
like there's always,
there's always some weird like right 

1358
01:05:12,411 --> 01:05:14,930
wing punchline about the French.
How much interaction do you.

1359
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:18,280
I think at point for me it's inherited

1360
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:18,550
or.
Yeah,

1361
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:20,200
that's what I'm saying.
I think it's every country.

1362
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:24,210
Remember that episode of the Sopranos?
Women with daily chef.

1363
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,190
Can I get some red shorts?
He's like,

1364
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:29,350
I want a red sauce.
Marinara,

1365
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:31,330
and the guy looked at the other guy.
He goes,

1366
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,740
if you think these Germans a class list,
you know what I'm saying?

1367
01:05:35,741 --> 01:05:36,900
Like,
look at this guy here.

1368
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,440
He's like,
they all have.

1369
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:41,740
Every country must have something 
towards.

1370
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:43,240
Yeah.
I hear that.

1371
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:47,410
We're hated across the world,
but then one person like you traveling,

1372
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:50,710
you go know pro people were very nice.
They are nice.

1373
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:52,990
If you are nice and I think that's 
universal.

1374
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:55,740
People are Nice if you're nice.
Yeah,

1375
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:58,960
pretty powerful that people appreciate 
it pretty much everywhere.

1376
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:00,880
People are Nice.
If you're nice,

1377
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:06,550
you know,
and and the way you are changes the way 

1378
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:06,550
they are,
you know,

1379
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:11,610
like if you run into someone and maybe 
they're a little bit defensive but 

1380
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:15,511
you're openly friendly,
a lot of times the relaxed that whereas 

1381
01:06:15,511 --> 01:06:20,190
if you run into someone in their sort of
defensive and you're aggressive with 

1382
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:26,011
them,
then it ramps up and the whole thing 

1383
01:06:26,011 --> 01:06:27,520
becomes like some sort of a weird ego 
disaster st person,

1384
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:31,480
different person interacting with them 
saying the same words.

1385
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:36,520
It's just the whole thing about people 
and the way we talk to each other.

1386
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,590
Yeah,
because we're,

1387
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:41,650
it's a,
there's no one person responsible for an

1388
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:42,790
argument,
you know,

1389
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:46,930
most of the time it comes from both 
sides and how you interact with people.

1390
01:06:46,931 --> 01:06:49,480
Even if you feel like you did nothing 
wrong.

1391
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:54,900
It's a lot of times,
like a big part of how the conversation 

1392
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,030
started shaping itself.
People don't want to.

1393
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,170
Everybody wants everything to be black 
or white,

1394
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:04,590
right?
It's either like if you got an argument 

1395
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:04,590
with the dude,
it's his fault or it's your fault,

1396
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:09,510
but it could easily be both.
Can easily be like just a mismanaged 

1397
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:10,450
situation.
You know,

1398
01:07:10,451 --> 01:07:14,590
you might have been coming there because
there might've been some fucking problem

1399
01:07:14,591 --> 01:07:17,980
that they were supposed to fix on your 
car and they didn't and you know,

1400
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:22,390
you are in your car headed to the comedy
store and you're like this mother fucker

1401
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:23,770
and the light starts going on again.

1402
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:28,770
Like God damn it and you get there.
You're already a little bit ramped up 

1403
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:31,860
and you run into someone and then you're
already coming at them at like a six and

1404
01:07:33,071 --> 01:07:34,870
if you get an interaction with them 
about like,

1405
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,430
hey man,
anything I can get in front of you,

1406
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,620
I got to go some where you're like,
fuck you man.

1407
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:40,300
Right?
That could happen.

1408
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:41,920
Totally does.
You don't know.

1409
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,480
You don't know.
That's why I've always learned the very 

1410
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,390
important lesson in life.
You don't know what that guy's going 

1411
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:51,390
through it today.
No one does.

1412
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:54,230
Right before you hit her members,
before you give that dirty guy,

1413
01:07:54,231 --> 01:07:56,560
it's the hardest thing to cut them off.
Yeah.

1414
01:07:56,650 --> 01:08:01,240
You don't know if his wife just left.
The kid just told him she was a lesbian.

1415
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:06,690
You know,
this is all of a sudden he's got a 

1416
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:06,690
girlfriend.
He goes,

1417
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:10,531
have a fucking gun car.
You don't know what somebody is going 

1418
01:08:10,531 --> 01:08:10,531
through.
Right?

1419
01:08:10,531 --> 01:08:13,000
You have no idea what time that mind 
coming up to you.

1420
01:08:13,001 --> 01:08:18,001
You know?
One of the most genius thing is I ever 

1421
01:08:18,001 --> 01:08:18,001
heard was

1422
01:08:18,001 --> 01:08:19,610
that a great Carlo Gambino.
Never answered his own door.

1423
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:26,590
He always had his wife answered the door
because no matter how mad a mobster came

1424
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:30,320
over,
no matter how,

1425
01:08:30,321 --> 01:08:35,321
like he just got off the phone with this
fucking guy and he won't give me 10 

1426
01:08:35,321 --> 01:08:38,411
kilos.
Carlos' going to resume this no matter 

1427
01:08:38,411 --> 01:08:38,990
how mad I came into the house,
his wife would stop you,

1428
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:44,600
make you sit down and give you an 
express on giving you a score and talk 

1429
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,590
to you.
So by the time you got into Carlo,

1430
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:49,970
you were slowed down.
He was very smart that way.

1431
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:53,840
That's beautiful because he always,
his wife was like,

1432
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:58,700
everybody's mom,
one of those ladies that you'll go ahead

1433
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:04,070
and come in and get me.
So that's why it's not good for 

1434
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:07,121
everybody.
If men get together for long periods of 

1435
01:09:07,121 --> 01:09:08,390
time,
I think that I think that people should.

1436
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:14,080
Anybody who's involved with customer 
service should take some type of 

1437
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:17,930
something to let to calm people down.
Like people who work at an airport,

1438
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:23,710
you know,
there's got to be a system out of slow 

1439
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:25,400
somebody down.
It's a brilliant system.

1440
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,520
Having a wife that like a very nice 
person that sits you down and you 

1441
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:32,660
realize like,
listen,

1442
01:09:32,661 --> 01:09:34,610
this is what's important in this kind of
friendship here.

1443
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:37,850
Like half of the issues that people get 
into.

1444
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:40,190
It's a perspective issue.
It's like,

1445
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:45,460
like especially if you're like a monster
and he thinks so much fucking you over 

1446
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:45,460
and you're like,
oh,

1447
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:45,460
you know,
where's my fucking money?

1448
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,910
And you sit down,
like come on.

1449
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:49,300
Perspective issue.
Yeah.

1450
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,120
It's most of what it is like how are you
looking at your relationship?

1451
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:56,000
Are you trying to fuck this person over 
here trying to work together in harmony?

1452
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,890
If you're just trying to work together 
in harmony,

1453
01:09:57,891 --> 01:09:58,880
I bet it'll work out.

1454
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:03,310
We all travel.
We ever have a bad travel day and we get

1455
01:10:03,311 --> 01:10:08,311
to a hotel and we'll fucking furious 
with that little lady at the counter 

1456
01:10:08,311 --> 01:10:11,070
made us laugh and for sure about what 
just happened.

1457
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:16,470
True.
And should we even do something that 

1458
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:18,590
will change your whole outlook for the 
day?

1459
01:10:18,591 --> 01:10:19,940
Like she'll go,
oh by the way,

1460
01:10:19,941 --> 01:10:24,941
I know you were delayed.
We told the kitchen to save your 

1461
01:10:24,941 --> 01:10:26,540
spaghetti and meatballs and you're like,
you bad motherfucker.

1462
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:28,280
You Wow.
You know?

1463
01:10:28,281 --> 01:10:30,200
So that's.
I liked it when that happens.

1464
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:35,260
I love when I'm furious and like walk 
into a hotel and somebody slows me down 

1465
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:39,600
and talks to me and it's really cool 
when people have that.

1466
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:44,620
That's a gift by the way,
to actually slow somebody down and be 

1467
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:45,010
able to touch him and go,
hey man,

1468
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,690
it's going to be fun and coming up.
Let me take it to the track them.

1469
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:53,460
If you have a business,
you have a customer service 

1470
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:53,460
representative,
someone who meets people at the door and

1471
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:56,990
that person has an amazing personality.
That shit is worth a lot of money.

1472
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,060
Oh yeah.
I can't coach it.

1473
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:04,040
You can't train whether it's a guy or a 
girl and I've met him on both sides.

1474
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:09,290
You know,
you meet people that work in a certain 

1475
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:11,471
place where you look forward to going 
back to that place to saying hi to that 

1476
01:11:11,471 --> 01:11:12,710
guy because that guy is just super cool.
You're like,

1477
01:11:12,711 --> 01:11:13,920
what's up?
What's up man?

1478
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:19,070
And like you've made like legitimate 
friendship with this person and that's 

1479
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:20,460
possible too.
You know,

1480
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:24,320
this idea that we all have to be 
constantly at odds with each other and I

1481
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:28,770
think even like security people,
like when I see when I'm in a restaurant

1482
01:11:28,771 --> 01:11:33,771
or a bar or a sporting event and I see a
security guy is what's that word is 

1483
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,620
dissolve the situation without throwing 
a punch.

1484
01:11:37,621 --> 01:11:41,010
Especially when a person a good one,
especially when a person's drunk.

1485
01:11:41,011 --> 01:11:42,540
Listen,
I can talk to you when you're sober.

1486
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:45,030
Once you got four cocktails on the,
I'm going to talk to you once.

1487
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,110
Some of my patients lead,
well,

1488
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:48,600
it's Donald,
you know it's fucking dark,

1489
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,810
but there are some people who stay calm 
and they go,

1490
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:56,811
we know man,
let's just take a walk over here and 

1491
01:11:56,811 --> 01:11:57,780
talk about it and you fall for it.
Next thing you know,

1492
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:58,830
you're out,
Brian.

1493
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:01,380
No matter if your girlfriends with some 
other guy,

1494
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:06,381
you know,
they come rushing into a bar and people 

1495
01:12:06,381 --> 01:12:07,140
were tremendous at that.
That's a great gift.

1496
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,500
You know who can do that shit?
Big John Mccarthy,

1497
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:16,400
big John McCarthy.
Who's the best at like separating shit 

1498
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,580
when shit goes sideways and the octagon,
isn't he an ex police officer and he's a

1499
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:22,600
giant because the giant.
I mean he's a big dude.

1500
01:12:22,601 --> 01:12:26,180
He's a black belt in Jujitsu and when,
when shit gets weird inside the octagon,

1501
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:31,190
the cop and hip comes out.
People if there's some chaos and some 

1502
01:12:31,190 --> 01:12:35,871
crazy shit,
he puts out fucking halt to that no 

1503
01:12:35,871 --> 01:12:36,540
more.
Yeah,

1504
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:38,370
those guys are important,
man.

1505
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:43,910
It's important to have people like that.
Now that is a skill though is it's a 

1506
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:45,300
giant skill.
It also be a good guy,

1507
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:50,540
which he also is like,
like big John McCarthy's a hell of a 

1508
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:51,180
human,
by the way.

1509
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:54,330
Formally congrats on a thousand men.
That's really awesome.

1510
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:57,600
Listen,
amazing party started.

1511
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,440
Hey guys.

1512
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,040
It's really incredible,
man.

1513
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:08,750
It's probably more right.
I think it's like a hundred and 43 or 

1514
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:09,300
something.
Probably real riddick.

1515
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:12,180
There's a bunch of other named ones.
Fight companions,

1516
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:14,730
fight breakdowns.
That would never,

1517
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:19,820
ever dream when you started doing these 
meaning either they would have the 

1518
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:22,650
impact that they have.
Let's just keep that shit known.

1519
01:13:22,651 --> 01:13:27,651
Void.
Fucking saying like people want to hear 

1520
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:30,370
this.
I remember him calling me up to the room

1521
01:13:30,371 --> 01:13:35,371
with me yelling at Joe and like fucking 
crazy fuckers home on a Friday night.

1522
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,450
Thirteen year old is.
Take that off.

1523
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:43,190
Take that shit off when I'm smoking pot.
We were in the green room at the 

1524
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:43,190
peninsula.
No,

1525
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:45,060
no carbs.
No.

1526
01:13:45,061 --> 01:13:48,250
This was somewhere else.
This is doing a podcast.

1527
01:13:48,251 --> 01:13:53,251
Meet him in red bank.
One of the first podcast we did was off 

1528
01:13:53,251 --> 01:13:56,061
this thing called Justin Dot TV.
Justin TV and we didn't agree and we did

1529
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:00,570
them back when there were cellular 
modems,

1530
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:04,260
so he'd be streaming like there wasn't 
like a lot of Wifi back then,

1531
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:07,740
so we'd be streaming from a cell phone 
hookup.

1532
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,060
Yeah,
it was terrible.

1533
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:12,220
Like real pixilated stuff.
But we were like,

1534
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:17,220
this could be fucking weird and have 
people like watch us get ready in the 

1535
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:19,360
green room talking to the camera.
We're just can be bizarre.

1536
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,620
So we decided to do a few of those,
but Joe,

1537
01:14:22,621 --> 01:14:24,760
he was like,
get this fucking thing away from me.

1538
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:30,570
But that was,
that was the different Joey Diaz back 

1539
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:30,570
then,
you know,

1540
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:31,570
you were still uncomfortable.
You know,

1541
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:36,780
it was funny with that.
That was the thing that set you free to 

1542
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:37,300
let people know who you are.
At the beginning when he was like,

1543
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:38,290
hey dude,
weren't you also like,

1544
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:40,240
what the fuck are you doing?
No,

1545
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:40,690
no,
no.

1546
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:46,240
I was like,
are you like a bird collar kind of guy 

1547
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,301
or something like,
I thought it was like one of those 

1548
01:14:48,301 --> 01:14:48,301
weird.
You know what I mean?

1549
01:14:48,301 --> 01:14:48,390
Things that people do though.
It was like a bird call.

1550
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:52,780
Are we talking about man,
he was onto it.

1551
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,370
He would be on there at night and I just
didn't like it.

1552
01:14:57,371 --> 01:15:02,371
I didn't know,
but then Dane Cook became a megastar 

1553
01:15:02,371 --> 01:15:04,150
would my space and everybody in that 
mother went on.

1554
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,350
That was before me,
but they were not cook.

1555
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:12,360
They was doing.
They just thought by going on my space 

1556
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:12,360
and going,
I got free tickets tonight.

1557
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:12,680
Yeah,
that.

1558
01:15:12,681 --> 01:15:14,200
That was gonna work.
They ain't cook.

1559
01:15:14,201 --> 01:15:19,201
Was communicating with them.
True and people would see the 

1560
01:15:19,201 --> 01:15:19,201
communication and go,
wow,

1561
01:15:19,201 --> 01:15:20,320
we can have live interaction,
blah,

1562
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:20,580
blah,
blah,

1563
01:15:20,581 --> 01:15:20,990
blah,
blah.

1564
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:26,070
Dane was doing that way before me.
He was doing that on my space and my 

1565
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:26,540
2002 or something like that.
Right.

1566
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:28,270
Wasn't it by the way?
Early on.

1567
01:15:28,271 --> 01:15:30,370
Yeah.
What about in 2003?

1568
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:32,980
We'll check the lineup.
Will check the old calendars.

1569
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:38,290
We did the fourth of July weekend in 
Nirvana and I'll never forget that.

1570
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:40,120
I said to you,
do you have radio?

1571
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:42,080
And you go,
I have no radio.

1572
01:15:42,081 --> 01:15:47,081
I'm a little panicked and that Thursday 
when we got down to the whole weekend 

1573
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:51,031
was so good and that's what I said,
Joe Rogan's onto something with that 

1574
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:53,320
fucking computer,
like,

1575
01:15:53,321 --> 01:15:56,570
fuck this shit,
because my philosophy was that computer.

1576
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:01,620
Do you think Richard Pryor would go home
before the morning coked up and get on 

1577
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,160
fucking facebook.
That was my thing at that time,

1578
01:16:03,161 --> 01:16:05,650
like sunglasses,
fucking thing,

1579
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:09,550
that fucking Richard Price and they go 
home and get on on my space.

1580
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:14,970
So I was exposed it,
but once I saw five sold out shows and 

1581
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,320
Irvine,
the older vine when it was known that if

1582
01:16:17,321 --> 01:16:19,600
you didn't do radio,
nobody's going to show up there.

1583
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:22,490
And that was it.
That was it.

1584
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:27,500
To me,
that was maybe a believer that there's 

1585
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:27,500
something there.
Yeah,

1586
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:28,640
it's amazing.
The,

1587
01:16:28,641 --> 01:16:33,641
uh,
the range of people that come up to me 

1588
01:16:33,641 --> 01:16:34,480
about your show,
you know,

1589
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:39,700
like the,
like all types of fucking pilots,

1590
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:43,480
a fighter I've had like amateur 
fighters,

1591
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:48,510
professional fighters,
the range of people that are interested 

1592
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:48,510
in your show,
you know what I mean?

1593
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:51,010
It's a really wide range of people.
It's fascinating.

1594
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,870
Like it's really reached a lot of 
people.

1595
01:16:52,871 --> 01:16:55,120
Man.
I was freaking me out,

1596
01:16:55,121 --> 01:16:57,700
man.
I was in burbank the other day.

1597
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:59,890
Okay,
so you got a haircut?

1598
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,800
We could go.
All right.

1599
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:03,880
You don't make the.
I had,

1600
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:06,370
I went to Jujitsu and had a half hour to
kill.

1601
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:08,800
So before they had cut,
I just smoked a joint.

1602
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:13,730
I was in my car on Magnolia Boulevard up
the block from Porto's,

1603
01:17:13,731 --> 01:17:18,731
which is fucking back.
And I opened up the sunroof and I just 

1604
01:17:18,731 --> 01:17:21,980
started smoking a joint before they had 
cut and I put a piece of gum in my mouth

1605
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:27,010
and I actually walked through the 
crosswalk to walk across the street and 

1606
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:31,421
there was a lady holding a kid with 
another one in the thing and she looked 

1607
01:17:31,421 --> 01:17:33,830
at me and when she looked at me and go,
fuck,

1608
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:35,030
this lady smells me.

1609
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:37,640
You know when you,
when you don't have a child,

1610
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:42,970
you don't give a fuck about refund.
But when you have a child and you see a 

1611
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:45,740
mom with a child,
you feel kind of fucking sorry man.

1612
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,600
I didn't say it until she looked at me 
and she goes,

1613
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:53,200
oh my God,
with the kid in her thing and with the 

1614
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:53,200
Stroller,
she looked at me,

1615
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,240
she goes,
blue cheese with your fucking mother.

1616
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:58,340
I loved it.
I'm from Buffalo.

1617
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:01,610
I looked at her and she just kept 
walking,

1618
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:06,940
but it was like the type of woman that 
wouldn't say that to me with the kid 

1619
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:07,790
ended up pushing.
She goes,

1620
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:09,680
blue cheese with wings and go,
fuck your mother.

1621
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:11,510
I love you.
And She just kept walking.

1622
01:18:11,511 --> 01:18:13,250
I was like,
oh my God.

1623
01:18:13,251 --> 01:18:15,450
Amazing man.
What?

1624
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:20,570
What about?
I went to Sacramento and families with 

1625
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:20,990
kids.
It's fucking crazy,

1626
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:25,470
but the realm of the people,
why they come up to you and Tsa?

1627
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:26,840
Don't forget about Tsa,
Tsa,

1628
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:29,990
but the realm of people and the reasons 
why.

1629
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,580
That's what I'm saying.
That's what the actual,

1630
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:36,581
which always killed me.
Like I've been around for 20 years and 

1631
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:38,780
what made you come to my show is I 
totally shit about.

1632
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,480
I told the story about taking a shit in 
somebody's back yard.

1633
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:44,350
I loved it.
We laughed like you.

1634
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:45,650
You're like,
oh my God.

1635
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,870
Yeah.
That's what,

1636
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:51,960
you know when somebody comes up to me,
it's always they came to a show for 

1637
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:52,790
something different.
I said on here.

1638
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,860
Yeah,
you know,

1639
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,750
that's really weird.
It's amazing.

1640
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:58,520
And the,
like you said,

1641
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,850
the contrast.
It's not just a six foot guy.

1642
01:19:01,851 --> 01:19:02,540
No,
it's everything.

1643
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:05,780
Steroid guy.
It's a mom with a baby in a stroller.

1644
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:11,300
I was saying I have people that so want 
me to give you things.

1645
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,270
It's so annoying.
They're like,

1646
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:18,700
because they always start with like 
trying to flatter me and like try and 

1647
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,550
they're like,
dude,

1648
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,050
I think you're fucking hilarious.

1649
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,100
I go,
thanks man.

1650
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,300
I love your shit.
I listen to it.

1651
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:27,050
I listened to on the way to work every 
day and I'm like,

1652
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:27,820
oh,
thanks a lot.

1653
01:19:27,821 --> 01:19:28,520
And they're like,
yeah man,

1654
01:19:28,521 --> 01:19:33,521
it's so funny.
Like I love this bit and that bit and 

1655
01:19:33,521 --> 01:19:33,521
I'll be like,
it's very nice you man.

1656
01:19:33,521 --> 01:19:33,770
Thank you very much.
Like,

1657
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:36,320
and I listened to your podcast and I 
fucking love it.

1658
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,780
It's so fucking funny.
I'm like,

1659
01:19:38,781 --> 01:19:40,040
thank you.
And then they're like,

1660
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:41,960
hey,
will you give this to Joe?

1661
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:47,700
That's their,
their whole thing like did you think 

1662
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:47,700
because you told me all those 
compliments,

1663
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,880
I'm going to be your messenger and 
they'd be like,

1664
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:50,530
no,
I mean,

1665
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:53,420
just like if you could give it to them.
Okay,

1666
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:56,420
sure.
I get this request every other week.

1667
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:02,290
What kind of weird shit?
I tell always fucking packages and 

1668
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:02,690
envelopes.
I don't open.

1669
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:03,890
The men could.
Yeah.

1670
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,750
No,
they go right.

1671
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:11,390
I tell them to send them directly to you
and like the cup he gave to him and tell

1672
01:20:11,531 --> 01:20:13,440
him to do that.
He gave me two cups.

1673
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,560
I gave one to Alberto and I gave one to 
you.

1674
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:19,110
This is a highly ineffective way to 
communicate with people.

1675
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:22,350
I sending them shit,
you know,

1676
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:24,870
people think that I want to have shit in
my car.

1677
01:20:24,871 --> 01:20:29,871
Like he gives us the time,
like I'm going to have this in my 

1678
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:29,910
fucking car.
I got the newest latest Bong.

1679
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:31,860
It's totally different than it is a 
bong.

1680
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:33,870
First of all,
you can drop it out of an airplane.

1681
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:36,210
It will not break.
It's military grade,

1682
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:37,650
bro.
This is the bog.

1683
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:42,680
The bog dwindled bongs.
The catastrophe apocalypto you've had 

1684
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,220
this pitch ended the world bomb,
Bro.

1685
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:47,860
This bond is made out of the same shit 
that Wolverine's claws.

1686
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:55,020
There's a closet in my office,
guy slide open and I cannot tell you.

1687
01:20:55,710 --> 01:21:00,710
I must have a 300 black tee shirts from 
different bands and shit and I got 

1688
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:04,530
every.
I mean look at me.

1689
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:06,240
I got every protein,
powder,

1690
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:12,320
fuel and energy thing that you can come 
and get me.

1691
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,250
I got more geese.
Most Jujitsu schools.

1692
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,650
Yeah.
That's how many gies a given to me.

1693
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,560
Mailed to me.
I have to mail them back.

1694
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,230
My wife says,
I seen one more fucking.

1695
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:30,740
I will throw that shit out.
It's just amazing albums because people 

1696
01:21:32,251 --> 01:21:37,251
know I like.
I come home with vinyl every fucking 

1697
01:21:37,251 --> 01:21:37,251
week.
Really?

1698
01:21:37,251 --> 01:21:41,580
Some of it is fucking atrocious,
but some of it is fantastic.

1699
01:21:41,581 --> 01:21:46,581
I listened to everything you do.
You have a hard time checking out old 

1700
01:21:46,581 --> 01:21:48,660
shit.
I feel bad for people.

1701
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:53,840
I understand that they've worked for it 
and I understand that they went out of 

1702
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:58,671
their way for it,
but if I haven't seen Duncan in six 

1703
01:21:58,671 --> 01:22:01,500
months and I got a bullish candle,
it goes in the garbage.

1704
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:04,930
Like once Dunkin moved to New York,
I grew all Duncan's shit.

1705
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:10,990
Only saved mushrooms.
Mvma for already come up to me and get 

1706
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:15,921
me heavy drugs for like I will bring it 
back on the plane for rob because he's 

1707
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:17,830
my brother.
Oh,

1708
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:23,190
you know what they come and get some guy
gave about a month ago gave me a book 

1709
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:26,640
about Stars and Oh Jesus.
When I looked,

1710
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:31,560
he was the author.
Like if that gets told everyone.

1711
01:22:31,561 --> 01:22:33,510
That guy gave me that book and I showed 
it to you,

1712
01:22:33,511 --> 01:22:34,790
like how to be a real man.

1713
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:41,940
One of his rules was be 40.
That'd be a real man.

1714
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,250
He was just like,
we went over it on your podcast,

1715
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,960
man,
that guy for a long time.

1716
01:22:48,961 --> 01:22:52,890
He gave that to like a bunch of us.
We have Hong Kong and he was like,

1717
01:22:52,891 --> 01:22:57,891
here's this book.
I'd rather let me look at it as him on 

1718
01:22:57,891 --> 01:22:57,891
the cover and it's all glossy and he's 
in.

1719
01:22:57,891 --> 01:23:01,430
He's looking off to the side and that 
was when I first did your podcasts.

1720
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:03,270
He was the first time I did it.
Yeah.

1721
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:08,790
That was how many years ago that.
That was probably when we started at 

1722
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:10,780
seven years ago.
It was probably five years ago.

1723
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:14,320
Yeah.
I do get a lot of Nice shit though.

1724
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:16,700
Oh yeah.
I do get a lot of new.

1725
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:21,220
I'm talking about when people might have
with the studio who made that thing.

1726
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:24,100
A kid in Cleveland thing is good.

1727
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:24,820
Uh,
I got,

1728
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:27,580
I get great books sent to me.
I mean,

1729
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:31,990
phenomenal money books.
I'm reading one right now.

1730
01:23:31,991 --> 01:23:36,991
That is the creepiest thing.
The three lives with Jimmy page from 

1731
01:23:36,991 --> 01:23:41,461
led.
Jump on that motherfucker traveled with 

1732
01:23:41,461 --> 01:23:41,461
a 14 year old girl,
Bro.

1733
01:23:41,461 --> 01:23:45,520
Never got charged with statutory rape.
Really just traveled with him for years.

1734
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:48,550
He's just a runaway on the tour,
on the tour,

1735
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:51,270
like fucking crazy.
He taught me.

1736
01:23:51,271 --> 01:23:53,060
Is that true?
You know,

1737
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,490
talking about his house and fucking,
uh,

1738
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:57,070
in uh,
where he lived.

1739
01:23:57,130 --> 01:23:58,350
He bought it from Alice,
took it,

1740
01:23:58,351 --> 01:24:03,040
was Alex to Crowley's all house,
a 24 karat warlock.

1741
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:07,720
He was,
he lived in his house and you know,

1742
01:24:07,721 --> 01:24:10,240
for some people it was like a way to 
sell records.

1743
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:15,630
Not for those,
for those four were onto something 

1744
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:16,010
magical,
you know,

1745
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:19,240
they were magical mine albums,
but this book kind of like,

1746
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:21,610
I got to put it down for two days at a 
time sometimes.

1747
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:22,630
Really?
Yeah.

1748
01:24:22,631 --> 01:24:27,631
He's a fucking nut.
That's what's called the three live 

1749
01:24:27,631 --> 01:24:30,900
looking.
The 10 wildest led Zeppelin led jazz 

1750
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:31,980
shit.
Scroll this shit down.

1751
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:34,450
Joe Rogan.
He did a 14 year old.

1752
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:38,080
Crazy man.
The truth Mannix was amazing.

1753
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:43,081
Just 14 when she met page paige page.
Did what he could to keep the 

1754
01:24:43,081 --> 01:24:43,120
relationship hidden.
Oh,

1755
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:43,810
that's true.

1756
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,230
That's crazy.
Wow.

1757
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:54,370
That's weird.
He was crazy when they shoved the 

1758
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:56,810
little.
What they've shoveled after a baby shark

1759
01:24:56,811 --> 01:24:59,540
of the schicks pussy was so weird,
man.

1760
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:02,570
Like you could.
You could do that back then,

1761
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:06,500
right?
Like you could do weird shit back then.

1762
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:11,770
Yeah.
It makes you stop and think like what 

1763
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:11,770
that is.
It's like the,

1764
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:13,670
just the beginning of the information 
age,

1765
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:18,880
right.
Newspapers regularly distributed 

1766
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,791
television shows on the news.
All that stuff was only like a few 

1767
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,140
decades old when the sixties and the 
seventies rolled around.

1768
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:29,380
I mean,
you really think about the timeline 

1769
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:29,380
there.
It's really kind of fascinating.

1770
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:32,280
Do you ever think about the jump from in
technology from like,

1771
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:37,330
you know,
like you know how it sites that there 

1772
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:37,330
was no us weekly there.
Right?

1773
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:41,150
Right.
So things kind of advance and now 

1774
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:41,150
everything's monitored and now for 
instance,

1775
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:43,760
you can record a phone call.
Right?

1776
01:25:43,761 --> 01:25:45,890
Which is like would be a difficult thing
to do back then.

1777
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:48,740
Or you can have a recorder running on 
you.

1778
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:51,710
Do you ever think about how that lack,
you know,

1779
01:25:51,711 --> 01:25:55,670
the privacy goes away and how to,
to to some degree,

1780
01:25:55,671 --> 01:26:00,671
we can't even conceive of it right now,
but how easy it will be to record 

1781
01:26:00,671 --> 01:26:02,800
everything at some point.
Like how it'll,

1782
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:04,040
you know,
we joked like it's in

1783
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:09,040
your watch or it's in your glasses,
but it will be like you'll walk out of 

1784
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:12,700
every conversation and there'll be some,
some form to document it.

1785
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:15,170
Yeah,
it'd be a total loss.

1786
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:20,000
So there's gonna be,
there's gonna be some changes.

1787
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:25,090
I don't necessarily agree are done.
I'm not convinced I should say not 

1788
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:29,351
agree.
I'm not convinced that they're going to 

1789
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:29,351
be bad to do that.
Yeah,

1790
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:29,351
I,
I just,

1791
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:30,930
I wonder like what,
what,

1792
01:26:30,970 --> 01:26:35,970
what's gained through this kind of 
privacy now I'm not talking about like 

1793
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:39,521
privacy,
like corporations or the government 

1794
01:26:39,521 --> 01:26:42,131
being able to look into your life.
I'm talking about we might get to a 

1795
01:26:42,131 --> 01:26:46,271
position as human beings within our 
lifetime where everybody looks into 

1796
01:26:46,271 --> 01:26:47,420
everything about everybody.
Everything,

1797
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:52,600
right?
Finances your day to day life sexually 

1798
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:56,540
here,
seeing you everywhere you go,

1799
01:26:56,780 --> 01:27:01,780
no matter what you do.
Like what we could get to a position 

1800
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,530
where there's no disconnection from any 
of us,

1801
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:05,480
but we're all connected to each other.

1802
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:07,880
If this keeps going the way it goes.
Right.

1803
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:11,600
So it used to be everybody lived far 
apart and you know,

1804
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:13,660
you have to ride a horse to get to the 
friend,

1805
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:18,700
say hi and talk to them and hopefully 
he's still alive when he came back the 

1806
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:19,610
next day know.
But there was no communication.

1807
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:24,910
Then it got two phone calls it in as as 
things have ramped up and now it's in 

1808
01:27:25,221 --> 01:27:30,221
your phone and now your phone's in your 
watch and now your watch can tell you 

1809
01:27:30,221 --> 01:27:34,781
who's calling you and you can.
You can look at your phone and you see 

1810
01:27:34,781 --> 01:27:35,450
the person start track type shit already
happening,

1811
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,530
right?
Yeah,

1812
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,320
and it's getting deeper and deeper and 
deeper.

1813
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:43,670
People are streaming live streaming live
streaming facebook.

1814
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:48,700
No matter what they do all day.
There's a slew of people paying video 

1815
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:49,010
games,
live streaming.

1816
01:27:49,011 --> 01:27:52,160
People are tuning in,
watching other people play video games.

1817
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:57,820
I mean we're getting deeper and deeper 
into this technological rabbit hole 

1818
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:00,380
where it becomes embedded in your life 
in a way that was unimaginable before it

1819
01:28:00,381 --> 01:28:05,381
was introduced.
Same thing as cell phones before cell 

1820
01:28:05,381 --> 01:28:06,800
phones were introduced.
Who would have ever believed,

1821
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,240
if you told them that you were going to 
get to a point in human history where it

1822
01:28:11,241 --> 01:28:16,241
is totally common to see people staring 
at electronic screens while they're all 

1823
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:22,001
sitting together at a dinner table,
that they could be five people sitting 

1824
01:28:22,001 --> 01:28:22,880
around and they not even talking to each
other.

1825
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:26,510
They're just staring at this electronic 
screen and that screen is compelling.

1826
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:27,890
You know it.
I know it.

1827
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:30,170
I get drawn to it.
You get drawn to it.

1828
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,240
When that was,
man might be some crazy news.

1829
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,670
Let me check Google real quick.
You never know.

1830
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:39,850
You never know what weird shit has been 
happening in the world and you get 

1831
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:43,271
sucked into this.
This thing is becoming a part of your 

1832
01:28:43,271 --> 01:28:43,490
life in a weird way that nobody 
anticipated.

1833
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:46,130
If it keeps going in the direction that 
it's going,

1834
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:51,400
it's going to get weirder in a way we 
never anticipated before where it's not 

1835
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,720
going to be just as simple as put your 
phone down and go outside.

1836
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:55,310
It's going to be your phone's a part of 
you.

1837
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:58,490
It's going to happen.
Your phone's almost a part of you.

1838
01:28:58,491 --> 01:29:00,170
Now,
if you have to have it,

1839
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:01,980
like I connected to this

1840
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,960
goddamn thing more than I touched my 
dog,

1841
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:05,760
right?
Total.

1842
01:29:05,761 --> 01:29:10,761
I love my dog,
but I touched that thing more than I'd 

1843
01:29:10,761 --> 01:29:10,761
touch my dog.
It's weird.

1844
01:29:10,761 --> 01:29:12,300
You want to protect.
It's not a pardon me man.

1845
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,270
I could just put it right there right 
there.

1846
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:16,050
Lenses right there.
Don't go anywhere.

1847
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:19,650
I got you right here.
That's basically a part of me.

1848
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:22,530
It's basically a part of me.
How long before I let them open me up?

1849
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:25,710
Still means there's a spot in my armpit.
I don't mean use those little.

1850
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,320
There's a great short about that.
There's a great short film about.

1851
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:29,670
Yes.
What's it called?

1852
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:31,080
I don't.
I don't remember the name of it,

1853
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:34,380
but it ends up like under the guise skin
out.

1854
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:36,420
It's going to happen.
It's really cool.

1855
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:39,030
I wish to stay away from this fucking 
thing.

1856
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:42,000
I tradjenta a different room at night.

1857
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:46,860
You know the Ipad I bought the right.
No fucking facebook.

1858
01:29:46,861 --> 01:29:50,520
Twitter or not that.
Neil Brandon rush on an IPAD.

1859
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:55,700
I bought an IPAD.
Do you have like one of those little 

1860
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:56,400
keyboard things you connect to a case 
like that bro?

1861
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:00,340
It's changed my life.
I used to have three hours of just shit.

1862
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:03,570
Time of day that it's not enough to work
out.

1863
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:05,970
So what are you writing notes?
Use the notes program.

1864
01:30:05,971 --> 01:30:06,520
What do you.
Yeah,

1865
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:11,550
I just write and fucking notes and if I 
don't like the joke that night I can go 

1866
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:13,110
back and add the tag.
You know what's real good.

1867
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:16,140
If you ever tried evernote,
evernote is real good.

1868
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:21,220
It allows you to use pictures,
all kinds of different things in black 

1869
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:21,220
out,
everything else.

1870
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:21,220
Um,
no,

1871
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:21,900
no,
that's a different thing.

1872
01:30:21,901 --> 01:30:24,420
That's a right room.
But ever note,

1873
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:25,340
uh,
you,

1874
01:30:25,341 --> 01:30:26,220
you,
if you,

1875
01:30:26,221 --> 01:30:28,260
uh,
write things like the things you want to

1876
01:30:28,261 --> 01:30:33,261
remember maybe before sets,
you can write them down in evernote and 

1877
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:36,390
then sync them from your ipad to your 
phone and back and forth.

1878
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:38,880
It's really good.
It's one that I use.

1879
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:42,420
I just got this ipad pro for three weeks
ago and it's changed my life.

1880
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:43,680
Yeah,
that's,

1881
01:30:43,681 --> 01:30:45,960
it changed my life.
I could give a fuck about twitter,

1882
01:30:45,961 --> 01:30:47,520
facebook hot,
nothing.

1883
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:49,920
When I go to that coffee shop,
the right,

1884
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:53,440
it's just that program.
I have everything else in there,

1885
01:30:53,441 --> 01:30:58,441
but I haven't even program.
I have the apps that I got my fitness 

1886
01:30:58,441 --> 01:31:01,290
plan and they're like a bjj training 
adrenaline and that's it.

1887
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:04,260
You know what I said about the Internet,
man,

1888
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:07,320
I think about the Internet,
like I think about foods that are sweet,

1889
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,590
like you can have them as long as you 
don't have too much,

1890
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,720
too much,
don't get crazy.

1891
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:15,120
That's how I feel about even going 
online.

1892
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:16,440
I think we're.
We're,

1893
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:21,530
we're,
we're getting to this weird point where 

1894
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:22,980
we're just relinquishing our,
our consciousness to this machine,

1895
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:27,570
relinquishing our consciousness 
connection that we all enjoy.

1896
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:30,480
It's not a consciousness.
It's the consciousness.

1897
01:31:30,481 --> 01:31:35,481
We're all sharing about a certain topic.
We all have to interject on what we 

1898
01:31:35,481 --> 01:31:38,070
think about Charlottesville or about 
trump and stuff like that.

1899
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:41,760
These days you get on facebook and 
twitter and you're fucking sad.

1900
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:44,730
You get sad.
You get sad for people.

1901
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:46,250
Okay.
I make it a habit.

1902
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:47,030
Friday,
Saturday,

1903
01:31:47,031 --> 01:31:48,780
and Sundays.
No reason to be on the Internet.

1904
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:53,810
You have to stay away from it.
There's no reason that the shows are 

1905
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:54,870
sold out.
Your family's at home.

1906
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,390
What?
What are you only go there?

1907
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,550
This is my.
This is my cheeseburger.

1908
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:02,140
Yeah.
I give a fuck.

1909
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:05,920
So on the weekends I don't touch it.
I forced myself,

1910
01:32:06,190 --> 01:32:08,800
don't touch it for what?
You have to have a life,

1911
01:32:08,801 --> 01:32:09,590
man.
Yeah,

1912
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,730
we are.
We are forgetting that there's a life.

1913
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:17,080
You ever go to a park and look at these 
fucking parents looking at their phones.

1914
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:19,090
You call it a park where your kid don't 
you?

1915
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,340
Yeah.
I don't take my phone out of the car.

1916
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:23,590
The park.
There's no recall.

1917
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:28,610
You,
your manager tell you they changed your 

1918
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:30,550
spot at the store from 10,
15 to 10:30.

1919
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:33,130
If you're with your kid and your wife,
you don't need your phone.

1920
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:37,540
You really don't show.
You got to get into floating man.

1921
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:40,570
How come you home float?
Because I smoked pot and I think of this

1922
01:32:40,571 --> 01:32:41,710
shit on my own.
Yeah,

1923
01:32:41,711 --> 01:32:43,360
but it's different.
That's why it's not.

1924
01:32:43,361 --> 01:32:45,390
It's not what you're thinking.
I can anxieties.

1925
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,320
Yeah,
but you'll be fine.

1926
01:32:47,321 --> 01:32:52,321
Becky works at the place in Pasadena and
we've been talking about a lot about it.

1927
01:32:53,381 --> 01:32:58,381
I'm really scared about these little 
dabs of anxiety that I get from time to 

1928
01:32:58,381 --> 01:32:58,381
time.
You'll be fine.

1929
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:00,340
It's good for your health.
No.

1930
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:05,360
I know it's good for my health,
but when I go get good blood with your 

1931
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:05,360
dad to go blood,
no problem.

1932
01:33:05,470 --> 01:33:10,470
Wait,
does weed make you more anxious or less 

1933
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:10,470
anxious and smoothing into out.
Okay.

1934
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:13,660
So then when it comes to certain things 
I have to see a window.

1935
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:19,340
Like it's really weird and right now 
there's not a window in it but I see 

1936
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:22,771
that fucking door.
Like when I walk up the steps at the 

1937
01:33:22,771 --> 01:33:24,760
original room and I get anxiety when a 
comics on stage.

1938
01:33:24,761 --> 01:33:26,440
It could be any,
it can be an open microphone.

1939
01:33:26,441 --> 01:33:30,880
I'm next and I start getting this,
the shortness of breath.

1940
01:33:30,881 --> 01:33:35,881
I have to turn around and look down the 
stairs at the comedy store just by me 

1941
01:33:35,881 --> 01:33:37,990
knowing that I could get out if shit 
goes down.

1942
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,900
I'm okay.
Hm.

1943
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,360
So I don't think a fucking tubs got 
windows are floating tank.

1944
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,460
They seal that thing over here,
you know,

1945
01:33:45,461 --> 01:33:46,360
they don't seal.
It's just,

1946
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:48,710
that's what I'm a little scared of it.

1947
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:51,580
I'm not claustrophobic either.
I was in the cell.

1948
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:54,370
None of that shit bothers me.
I just got to see a window.

1949
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,570
Yeah.
Well listen,

1950
01:33:55,571 --> 01:33:56,620
it's,
it's real easy,

1951
01:33:56,621 --> 01:33:58,300
like when you're in it,
it's right there.

1952
01:33:58,430 --> 01:34:00,700
You just lift your hand up and it's 
right there.

1953
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,500
The door's right there.
I know we had to stand up.

1954
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,180
You open the door.
It's on your hat.

1955
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:09,210
You know,
look what happened yesterday and in 

1956
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:09,210
Barcelona.
What a fucking shame.

1957
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:10,960
You can't conduct terrorist attacks to 
isolation.

1958
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:13,150
Well,
let me ask you a question,

1959
01:34:13,151 --> 01:34:15,130
Joe Rogan.
I even know that I asked you a question.

1960
01:34:15,131 --> 01:34:17,650
My brother,
you were an intelligent individual.

1961
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,050
You're an intelligent individual,
pumps or Jamie,

1962
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,860
you're not a fucking Phi Beta Kappa,
but you know,

1963
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,380
Jamie might be the smartest guy in the 
random.

1964
01:34:26,381 --> 01:34:27,880
I'm just teasing you,
Jamie.

1965
01:34:27,881 --> 01:34:31,300
How many people were looking down when 
they got hit by that car yesterday?

1966
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:36,340
Let's be honest.
60 five people got hit,

1967
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:37,960
but you know,
that's,

1968
01:34:38,030 --> 01:34:43,030
you know,
people are start paying attention as 

1969
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:45,090
Americans.
You cannot live in that fucking thing no

1970
01:34:45,091 --> 01:34:46,570
more.
We cannot.

1971
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:52,260
It's not smart.
It's not smart to be walking around 

1972
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:52,360
staring up fucking.
But sometimes you have to look at it.

1973
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,060
Oh,
there's,

1974
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:56,560
there's times where like someone of 
course sends you an address,

1975
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:59,210
you're meeting people there.
Then there's times you catch yourself.

1976
01:34:59,240 --> 01:34:59,850
You're like,
what am I going?

1977
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:04,160
What am I doing?
All three of us have children.

1978
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:07,430
Do we want our children to grow up on a 
fucking computer?

1979
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:12,460
Do we want them to have both?
They're going to grow up on computers.

1980
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,570
You're not going to.
I,

1981
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:18,010
I want them to grow up in computers,
but I don't want that whole lifestyle to

1982
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:20,120
be on the computer.
I want them to go outside.

1983
01:35:20,121 --> 01:35:21,330
I want them to get dirty.

1984
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:25,070
I want them to have life experiences.
Even if you know,

1985
01:35:25,071 --> 01:35:28,190
the only way you learn about life is 
sometimes by having a negative,

1986
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:30,170
something negative happening.
So true.

1987
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:33,460
Then these children that are on my 
computer to the 18,

1988
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:36,080
then they send them away and they 
fucking fractured.

1989
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:41,470
Yeah,
fractured with two different time now 

1990
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:42,500
for children guys and we're parents.
It's a different time.

1991
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:47,620
It's way different.
It's different in the way that I don't 

1992
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:47,620
think anybody's ever seen before,
so they don't know what the fuck.

1993
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:51,820
What the fuck to do Tom Scott under p 
lookout?

1994
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,360
Slimiest.
Beautiful,

1995
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:54,460
beautiful,
sexy.

1996
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:59,490
I try and keep it as normal as I can.
I try to keep it as normal as I can.

1997
01:36:00,051 --> 01:36:01,700
I never want to forget who the fuck I 
am.

1998
01:36:01,701 --> 01:36:04,970
Joe Rogan and I don't want to forget it 
for my children.

1999
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,280
My daughter,
you know,

2000
01:36:07,281 --> 01:36:08,350
I don't want them to be.

2001
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:13,550
I was driving home and I saw a little 
girl selling lemonade with her mom on 

2002
01:36:14,511 --> 01:36:19,130
the corner was 2000 degrees and in 
studio city I pull up to my house.

2003
01:36:19,131 --> 01:36:20,890
I go inside and get my daughter and I 
get the,

2004
01:36:20,891 --> 01:36:21,920
my,
my wife.

2005
01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:25,640
Let's go buy some fucking eliminated 
from this kid.

2006
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:29,270
All right.
My daughter's going to kindergarten next

2007
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:32,090
year at a school that's rated one of the
highest schools,

2008
01:36:32,091 --> 01:36:34,700
but it's a public school approach.
Kids go there,

2009
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:39,701
a bunch of kids go.
There is no reason to put your kid in 

2010
01:36:39,701 --> 01:36:39,701
these Notre Dame's and all these 
$25,000.

2011
01:36:39,701 --> 01:36:42,410
They want $34,000
a year for kindergarten.

2012
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:45,050
Why come on Joe Rogan?
What?

2013
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:47,000
Well,
how is your child going to benefit?

2014
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:49,160
Come on.
We're all intelligent here.

2015
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,770
That's $24,000,
monarch,

2016
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:54,680
Notre Dame,
all the other schools in the valley.

2017
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:59,210
They want 30 gs,
two g registration form to sign your kid

2018
01:36:59,211 --> 01:36:59,480
in.

2019
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,390
Really joke.
People want to keep their kids say no,

2020
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:07,450
that's not safe,
and so you could tell your friends that 

2021
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:07,880
your kids are fucking that school.
That's a little bit of size.

2022
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:11,840
Hold on.
My kids attend and you're like,

2023
01:37:11,841 --> 01:37:13,220
oh my God,
you're kidding.

2024
01:37:13,221 --> 01:37:18,221
Attempt to be a fucking dummy because 
he's in school with other rich people's 

2025
01:37:18,221 --> 01:37:21,821
fucking kids and they're all fucking 
dummies to you know that getting raised 

2026
01:37:21,821 --> 01:37:23,600
by Nannies.
I don't want that.

2027
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:25,340
I don't.
I go to the park.

2028
01:37:25,341 --> 01:37:28,070
How many fucking white kids do you see 
where Mexican women,

2029
01:37:28,071 --> 01:37:32,000
they got a fucking shame.
The Mexican women are adopting the white

2030
01:37:32,001 --> 01:37:37,001
kids at fucked up.
That's why they didn't want to build a 

2031
01:37:37,001 --> 01:37:38,090
wall because you got to raise their own 
fucking kids.

2032
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:44,190
That's why these white people didn't 
want Mexicans to go.

2033
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:49,690
California was going to raise their 
fucking kids swimming coach.

2034
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:53,290
I go to a swimming class Thursdays with 
my daughter jumping in front.

2035
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:55,630
There's no more white parents take of

2036
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,000
their nannies.
I run the fucking wire MCA with their 

2037
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,000
kids.
When your kid grows up and he's.

2038
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,080
What's his name?
My goal,

2039
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:03,150
Napa.
Low Mile.

2040
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:07,050
You know when he was one of those,
don't come crying to me.

2041
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,780
Don't come to me and let me tell you 
something.

2042
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:14,870
The pacifier,
I was raised to be a little cock sucker,

2043
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:19,380
but I snapped out of it.
Somewhat know when my father died,

2044
01:38:19,970 --> 01:38:24,970
when I was one of those little boys.
You see what that mom holding onto that 

2045
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:24,970
leg?
No,

2046
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:25,960
go.
I was one of those little fucking faggot

2047
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,450
kids.
Okay.

2048
01:38:27,451 --> 01:38:29,670
I stuck the pacifier until the age of 
six.

2049
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:30,990
Oh my God.
Okay.

2050
01:38:30,991 --> 01:38:35,130
I hope I had potential to be one thing.
One fucking thing.

2051
01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:40,190
You understand me?
But my mother would not allow that shit 

2052
01:38:40,190 --> 01:38:42,930
that happened.
Don't Latin mothers don't play that 

2053
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:42,930
Shit.
You know what I'm saying?

2054
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:44,010
Oh yeah.
Latin mothers do not allow that shit.

2055
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:45,180
I couldn't wear scarves.
You know?

2056
01:38:45,181 --> 01:38:47,010
It was on the west coast.
We wanted to wear a scarf,

2057
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:50,160
like a snoopy scarf,
like flags.

2058
01:38:52,210 --> 01:38:57,210
Like I was going to go fly a plane scarf
or what's it like one of those Randy 

2059
01:38:57,210 --> 01:39:00,861
coture scarves?
Which although I wouldn't where I think 

2060
01:39:00,861 --> 01:39:00,930
on him as quite fetching.
No,

2061
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:02,010
no scarves.
No.

2062
01:39:02,290 --> 01:39:04,620
You ever see the Randy coture scarf?
Yeah.

2063
01:39:04,621 --> 01:39:09,621
Randy called Torah will.
Where would I would call a tactical 

2064
01:39:09,621 --> 01:39:09,621
scarf.
Oh,

2065
01:39:09,621 --> 01:39:09,621
like that.
See,

2066
01:39:09,621 --> 01:39:14,340
that's the kind of scarf that like a 
navy seal would where randy wears a 

2067
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:16,770
bunch of those things.
But Randy is such a bad motherfucker.

2068
01:39:16,771 --> 01:39:18,870
It's almost like he's begging you to try
to choke him.

2069
01:39:18,871 --> 01:39:21,540
What that thing can come.
Come and try to grab that thing.

2070
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:28,460
I just leave.
That should be the name of that album 

2071
01:39:28,471 --> 01:39:29,820
right there.
That should be his album.

2072
01:39:29,821 --> 01:39:32,780
Cover scarf.
Scarf.

2073
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:36,960
It's crazy.
He's such a nice guy.

2074
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:41,210
A rennies or anything.
You know what?

2075
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:42,810
And His kid,
his kid,

2076
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:47,820
uh,
came to my show in Vegas and also has 

2077
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:47,970
like a,
a gym that coolest,

2078
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:48,930
coolest kid man.

2079
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:52,170
Like him and his wife,
I think both teach there too.

2080
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:53,080
Oh Wow.
Nice.

2081
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:54,870
Nice man.
His son,

2082
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:55,860
his son is.
Yeah,

2083
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:59,850
I think he was fighting in the world 
series of fighting,

2084
01:39:59,851 --> 01:40:02,640
which is now,
now is a new name,

2085
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:07,760
but yeah,
he fought for a bunch of different 

2086
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:07,760
people.
Right.

2087
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,931
To fight for strike force.
Now think he might've fought for Bella 

2088
01:40:09,931 --> 01:40:10,830
tour.
Ryan coture,

2089
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:12,720
talented fighter it.
While we're at it.

2090
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:17,730
Don't forget to remind you as fucking 
Gino giving you the CBD Roll-on on yet.

2091
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:18,950
Yes.
What do you think?

2092
01:40:18,990 --> 01:40:20,970
It's amazing.
How does that even work?

2093
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:24,000
Is that Buddha dogs?
I came home,

2094
01:40:24,001 --> 01:40:29,001
I scored it like a cream.
You Rub it on like spotify for my wife 

2095
01:40:29,001 --> 01:40:30,240
moves.
You really get out of the shower,

2096
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:35,430
done it gets in weird spots.
Dog must have some sort of anti 

2097
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:37,350
inflammatory properties or something 
like that.

2098
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:38,310
Do you like that?
Tie?

2099
01:40:38,311 --> 01:40:39,020
Lindemann.
Everybody.

2100
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:41,010
Anybody ever rubbed that stuff on?
You know,

2101
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:43,200
like ties,
like Thai boxers and shit.

2102
01:40:43,201 --> 01:40:48,201
They're like,
you got to realize they're always 

2103
01:40:48,201 --> 01:40:49,680
dealing with like bones slamming into 
their legs and they're all sore and shit

2104
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:51,880
and they rubbed this tie.
Linament.

2105
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:54,130
It's weird.
It's like Kiehl's

2106
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:56,200
valley stuff.
I don't think it heals up man,

2107
01:40:56,201 --> 01:41:01,201
but it makes sure it feels good.
It's a similar one.

2108
01:41:01,751 --> 01:41:03,280
Tiger Balm.
Like that girl Shit.

2109
01:41:03,281 --> 01:41:08,281
I have another thing.
It's called something juice and when I 

2110
01:41:08,281 --> 01:41:10,951
was a kid I used to have the I am poem 
bag and I rubbed it on my hands and do 

2111
01:41:10,951 --> 01:41:13,660
the I am poem technique and Shit.
With that it's called something that has

2112
01:41:13,661 --> 01:41:17,110
a weird smell to it.
Like does this stuff do like when?

2113
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:22,111
When,
when that stuff like heats your skin up 

2114
01:41:22,111 --> 01:41:22,111
and you're like,
Oh God,

2115
01:41:22,111 --> 01:41:22,690
like a icy hot.
Like that kind of shit.

2116
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:24,610
What does that really doing?
I have no idea.

2117
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:26,050
I think it's just tricking you into 
thinking.

2118
01:41:26,051 --> 01:41:29,360
So yeah,
I don't think it really is someone who's

2119
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:32,920
a friend of mine who's a doctor 
described it as a topical analgesic,

2120
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:35,890
meaning that it,
it does something to the surface of your

2121
01:41:35,891 --> 01:41:38,380
skin,
but maybe is it psychological that makes

2122
01:41:38,381 --> 01:41:39,670
you feel like it's healing up?

2123
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,460
Like when you have a muscle soreness or 
something like that,

2124
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,210
like if you have like a wound,
a little injury,

2125
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:50,740
there's a psychology psychological 
aspect to that heat and stuff.

2126
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:52,750
I feel like you think you're getting 
work done.

2127
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:57,810
You know,
there's probably a psychological aspect 

2128
01:41:57,810 --> 01:41:59,560
to healing in general.
I don't think it's 100 percent,

2129
01:41:59,740 --> 01:42:02,380
but I think you could sway it in a 
better direction.

2130
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:03,670
Yeah.
You know,

2131
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:06,340
I mean like that's got to be what the 
placebo effect is,

2132
01:42:06,341 --> 01:42:11,341
right?
They tell you they're going to give you 

2133
01:42:11,341 --> 01:42:11,341
a pill and it's gonna make you feel bad 
and you're like,

2134
01:42:11,341 --> 01:42:11,341
oh,
this is it.

2135
01:42:11,341 --> 01:42:13,450
This is the thing they gave me.
The gave me the pill,

2136
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:16,570
and you actually do feel better and even
show signs of recovery,

2137
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:20,500
like immediately corresponding to you 
taking that pill.

2138
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:25,650
Like your brain is convinced yourself.
What about that dude you've had on the 

2139
01:42:25,650 --> 01:42:28,741
podcast who's brain is like a fucking 
healing serum who can walk Wim Hof?

2140
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:30,220
Yeah.
Wim Hoff.

2141
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:30,880
Oh yeah,
dude,

2142
01:42:30,881 --> 01:42:31,650
he's.
I mean,

2143
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:33,820
he treats people.
He teaches people how to do it.

2144
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:38,910
He's as legit as they get.
He holds the world record for swimming 

2145
01:42:38,910 --> 01:42:39,430
under ice ice.
Yes,

2146
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:44,520
and by the way,
he fucked up and couldn't figure out 

2147
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:47,581
which way to get out because his retinas
had frozen over because the water was so

2148
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:49,510
cold.
How does he do this?

2149
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:53,980
He's an an em all.
He's a fucking savage.

2150
01:42:53,981 --> 01:42:56,260
That guy in the most beautiful sense of 
the word,

2151
01:42:57,190 --> 01:43:02,190
he just has incredible breath control.
That's a big part of his whole entire 

2152
01:43:02,741 --> 01:43:07,741
philosophy.
So the guys following this rope once 

2153
01:43:07,741 --> 01:43:08,710
he's committed to it,
by the way,

2154
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:13,760
like he's just got these little spots 
along the way where he can get some air,

2155
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:18,930
but he lost track.
He couldn't see good anymore because it 

2156
01:43:18,930 --> 01:43:22,051
was so god damn cold.
He couldn't figure out where the exit 

2157
01:43:22,051 --> 01:43:23,710
is,
so he went more than the full distance.

2158
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:27,910
That was his goal in the first place,
which was insane.

2159
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:30,610
All of it's insane.
Oh,

2160
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:31,930
fucking name,
man.

2161
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:36,280
I mean that guy is something special.
He teaches people,

2162
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:38,500
which is the crazier part even to me 
that he's.

2163
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:41,950
He's gotten people train them to swim in
freezing water,

2164
01:43:42,370 --> 01:43:45,520
walk through ice,
and also fight off a cold.

2165
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:46,690
Yes,
yes.

2166
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:51,720
Fuck me,
I use his breathing technique before 

2167
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:51,720
going on stage and when I do I have 
better shows.

2168
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:57,100
This is what I think.
I think you looked Kinda hyperoxygenate 

2169
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:58,580
and stimulate your mind how 
sophisticated breathing tick.

2170
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Well it's a lot of what he does that I 
find beneficial is like,

2171
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:07,190
and I've heard this concept in yoga 
before too,

2172
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:12,110
is breathing in like take a giant breath
and letting out,

2173
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:17,500
excuse me,
letting on about 20 percent and then 

2174
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,340
breathing in again as hard as you can,
let it out about 20 percent breathing in

2175
01:44:19,341 --> 01:44:23,330
as hard as you can and then continue 
that for like long periods of time.

2176
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:27,320
Dude,
I do that in the Cryo tank where I stand

2177
01:44:27,321 --> 01:44:28,550
in the cold air.
Yeah,

2178
01:44:28,850 --> 01:44:33,850
three minutes goes by like that.
There's a giant difference between when 

2179
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:35,870
I do that and when I don't do that.
So you focus on your breathing,

2180
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:38,180
it's a little bit of that.
There's definitely,

2181
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:43,210
there's something about people that are 
encountering any sort of stimulation 

2182
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:47,951
where it's real hard to manage the 
stimulation without letting everything 

2183
01:44:47,951 --> 01:44:51,311
get fucking crazy and haywire and being 
able to manage it has a gigantic effect 

2184
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:57,160
on what the actual results or the actual
experience of being this cold.

2185
01:44:57,830 --> 01:45:00,440
It's because it gets the same goddamn 
thing,

2186
01:45:00,441 --> 01:45:05,441
but if you can control your breath and 
control your consciousness and you're 

2187
01:45:05,441 --> 01:45:09,371
doing something that seems to be heating
up your body to and a little bit of a 

2188
01:45:09,371 --> 01:45:10,430
way,
almost like an internal exercise because

2189
01:45:10,431 --> 01:45:15,431
it's difficult to do because you're 
taking these big giant breasts of cold 

2190
01:45:15,431 --> 01:45:17,090
air and then you're letting out a little
and then you take it a big giant breath.

2191
01:45:17,091 --> 01:45:21,200
It's almost like you're flexing your 
lungs and when you do that man,

2192
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:26,830
I mean it might make it 20,
30 percent easier to deal with three 

2193
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:27,770
minutes supposedly.
I'm not kidding.

2194
01:45:27,771 --> 01:45:29,870
One of the Olympics,
I don't know what year it is.

2195
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:34,871
If you'd like to check whether the 
Russians beat the fuck out of the 

2196
01:45:34,871 --> 01:45:39,071
Americans.
Supposedly Americans came out walking 

2197
01:45:39,071 --> 01:45:41,150
you the flag and the Russian Joel Cave.
I'm going,

2198
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:42,970
Whoa,
Whoa,

2199
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:48,800
whoa.
And they couldn't figure out what the 

2200
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:48,800
fuck is wrong with these motherfuckers.

2201
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,810
That's what they were doing.
They warm up their lungs,

2202
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:54,080
looked back to think about what they're 
about to do,

2203
01:45:54,081 --> 01:45:59,081
the technique they're about to use,
and to let the blood go to the back of 

2204
01:45:59,081 --> 01:46:02,441
something fucking weird.
I read about that was pretty 

2205
01:46:02,441 --> 01:46:02,441
interesting.
Whether it's true or not,

2206
01:46:02,441 --> 01:46:06,281
I don't know,
but supposedly that cardio was so ahead 

2207
01:46:06,281 --> 01:46:10,381
of the United States because they were 
doing a pre breathing exercises.

2208
01:46:11,630 --> 01:46:16,630
Thinking had something to do.
Now is that the guy that also has the 

2209
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:19,640
record for the deepest drop?
I think it's a different guy,

2210
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:20,990
a different guy,
a different guy.

2211
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:23,630
He's the one that I wrote that I read 
about.

2212
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:28,920
He used the one that wrote about about 
how you have to prepare for all that 

2213
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:31,420
stuff and that it was learned when the 
Russians came up at the.

2214
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,440
It's interesting to focus on your 
breath,

2215
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,820
like I don't do it much.
I do.

2216
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:39,850
I actually been doing polities and it's 
way fucking harder than I thought it was

2217
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:42,050
gonna be,
but be like,

2218
01:46:42,051 --> 01:46:44,090
you're thinking about your breath for 
like an hour.

2219
01:46:44,091 --> 01:46:45,230
Basically.
You're always.

2220
01:46:45,290 --> 01:46:47,660
You're always working on your breath.
There's not.

2221
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:50,460
It's not a secret

2222
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:54,690
that like the greatest Jujitsu guy of 
all time had this crazy breath control.

2223
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:57,200
Really Hixon Gracie.
He had.

2224
01:46:57,210 --> 01:47:00,330
There's a bunch of videos of him.
He received a documentary choke.

2225
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:01,800
You ever heard of it?
No.

2226
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:05,040
It's an amazing documentary about this 
Guy Hixon Gracie,

2227
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:10,041
who's almost universally regarded as the
greatest Jujitsu player of all time and 

2228
01:47:10,041 --> 01:47:12,390
fought a bunch of fights in mma and 
strangled everybody fought,

2229
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:15,510
but he.
There's this video where he's doing this

2230
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:20,930
yoga warm up sort of thing that he would
do every day and he does this thing with

2231
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:26,541
his stomach that you watch them do this 
and it starts warming his stomach up.

2232
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,640
He's doing this like fire breathing 
shit,

2233
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:34,820
but then he starts sucking his stomach 
into like the upper corners of his rib 

2234
01:47:35,551 --> 01:47:40,551
cage,
like rhythmically in this like almost 

2235
01:47:40,551 --> 01:47:42,060
impossible thing.
Like can you watching them doing it?

2236
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:45,270
Like he's warming everything up and then
once he gets it warmed up,

2237
01:47:45,271 --> 01:47:47,580
you starts wiggling the internals.

2238
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:53,270
But look at this man.
Who the fuck has that kind of control of

2239
01:47:53,311 --> 01:47:56,670
your abdominal muscles to do this?
Every time he trained,

2240
01:47:56,671 --> 01:47:58,410
he did it all the time.
Did it constantly.

2241
01:47:58,411 --> 01:48:00,240
He did this,
he did yoga constantly.

2242
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:04,720
Gymnastics.
He did a type of yoga called a gymnastic

2243
01:48:04,721 --> 01:48:05,920
gun,
not trial,

2244
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:10,510
which is a Brazilian.
I'm a sort of a,

2245
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:16,670
um,
a combination of yoga and a lot of 

2246
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:19,230
movements like rolling and animal,
like movements,

2247
01:48:19,231 --> 01:48:21,750
natural movements,
amazing stuff.

2248
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:26,730
See if he could find the guy who created
that gymnastica natural.

2249
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:30,620
So you give the guy credit because 
there's a really amazing style carriers.

2250
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:36,020
Yes.
So her into gymnastics as a couple of 

2251
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:39,680
Brazilian guy teaching decimals is 
actually so much more bad ass than it's 

2252
01:48:40,231 --> 01:48:41,910
given credit for Jiu Jitsu.
No,

2253
01:48:41,911 --> 01:48:46,911
no,
I'm talking about like gymnast's for 

2254
01:48:46,911 --> 01:48:46,911
sure.
Or even like yoga masters.

2255
01:48:46,911 --> 01:48:49,920
Oh yeah.
Physical ability is so beyond.

2256
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:54,210
I think most people's perception of it 
when they first,

2257
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:55,260
you know,
think about it.

2258
01:48:55,350 --> 01:48:55,890
Like,
yeah,

2259
01:48:56,670 --> 01:48:58,230
fucking Psychos,
man.

2260
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:03,650
Professor Alvarado Romano is the guy who
created gymnastic unnatural and uh,

2261
01:49:05,311 --> 01:49:07,980
that was Hickson's thing and there's 
videos of him doing it,

2262
01:49:08,610 --> 01:49:11,760
doing it on the beach.
There's a video of Hicks and doing it,

2263
01:49:11,761 --> 01:49:14,760
and um,
you watch the movements and you go,

2264
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:16,260
oh,
this is almost like he's having,

2265
01:49:16,261 --> 01:49:21,261
like,
it's almost like shadow fighting with 

2266
01:49:21,261 --> 01:49:23,631
Jujitsu because you're being able to put
your body in these weird positions over 

2267
01:49:23,631 --> 01:49:25,020
and over and over again to balance 
yourself,

2268
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:30,740
saw a bunch of controlling your body in 
any weird way that you could possibly 

2269
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:35,451
encounter a position where you'd have to
be strong wild shit because he was way 

2270
01:49:35,451 --> 01:49:39,160
ahead of the curve man.
There was everybody back then was to,

2271
01:49:39,161 --> 01:49:44,161
in Mexican supplements and Dead Lifts 
and bench pressing and fucking running 

2272
01:49:44,401 --> 01:49:47,230
over each other and training camp,
beating the shit out of each other.

2273
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:50,280
And Hickson was just strangling people.
You know,

2274
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:53,260
it's really a fascinating thing when you
stop and think about it,

2275
01:49:53,261 --> 01:49:58,261
that this one guy was the best and so 
far ahead of the curve.

2276
01:49:58,571 --> 01:50:03,571
And so few people,
even people that really got into 

2277
01:50:03,571 --> 01:50:03,571
Jujitsu,
saw,

2278
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:04,510
well,
first of all,

2279
01:50:04,511 --> 01:50:06,740
he had amazing talent as dad was Leo,
grace it.

2280
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:11,750
Those are two giant factors,
but also the way he trained and the way 

2281
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:13,060
he controlled his breath and his own 
son,

2282
01:50:13,061 --> 01:50:18,061
Kron Gracie was world champion or the 
best grapplers in the world can do all 

2283
01:50:18,061 --> 01:50:22,771
that stuff too,
has massive breath control and he'll 

2284
01:50:22,771 --> 01:50:22,771
tell you,
it's all about your breath.

2285
01:50:22,771 --> 01:50:27,640
Like being able to control your breath 
is a massive part of your anxiety levels

2286
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:30,940
to massive part of how you can deal with
stress,

2287
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:36,420
how you can calm yourself down.
You have control and power over your 

2288
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:37,540
lungs.
What does this too?

2289
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:38,870
Oh,
this is another.

2290
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:44,500
He's out there in the jungle.
This guys actually doing it in the 

2291
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:47,691
jungle.
Jacques already does a lot of that 

2292
01:50:47,691 --> 01:50:47,691
stuff.
We all breathe naturally will make.

2293
01:50:47,691 --> 01:50:51,671
If you look at your children,
they are breathing the way that we're 

2294
01:50:51,671 --> 01:50:54,480
supposed to breathe somewhere with 10 or
12 or become a teenager.

2295
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:59,620
Yeah,
we go off like my breathing was 

2296
01:50:59,620 --> 01:50:59,670
complete.
I went to seminars.

2297
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,680
I went to digital.
Really,

2298
01:51:02,220 --> 01:51:07,220
when I went to Jujitsu,
I created so much fear in my mind from 

2299
01:51:07,321 --> 01:51:11,580
being on my back that I would 
immediately run outside and take my gear

2300
01:51:11,581 --> 01:51:16,170
off and pee my pants and people would 
quit.

2301
01:51:16,590 --> 01:51:18,640
Like I just pay a little bit of my short
term.

2302
01:51:19,370 --> 01:51:21,070
Most people would have quit.
Yeah.

2303
01:51:21,150 --> 01:51:22,430
I don't like that feeling.
Yeah.

2304
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:24,780
So I kept going back and I wouldn't 
improve.

2305
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:26,670
I would improve because of my car.

2306
01:51:26,700 --> 01:51:28,650
Yeah.
I had been smoking joints for 30 years.

2307
01:51:28,950 --> 01:51:30,030
Yeah,
I'm a fat fuck.

2308
01:51:30,090 --> 01:51:31,860
Yeah,
it was that I had a bill,

2309
01:51:31,861 --> 01:51:36,861
but like I had to get Bob's route,
his mouthpiece to build my diaphragm 

2310
01:51:36,861 --> 01:51:38,400
just to suck.
I had no therapy.

2311
01:51:38,401 --> 01:51:43,290
All of this because of Jujitsu is legit.
The boss routing thing is legit.

2312
01:51:43,291 --> 01:51:45,320
When I hit the bag,
I use the bus route and thing.

2313
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:50,440
Yeah.
I think what they're saying is the best 

2314
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:52,671
way to use it.
Just use it and it's an exercises 

2315
01:51:52,671 --> 01:51:52,671
exercise.
Use It,

2316
01:51:52,671 --> 01:51:56,211
use it like an exercise.
So let's do a few things with it and 

2317
01:51:56,211 --> 01:51:57,030
just blow some air out with it.
Like really good.

2318
01:51:57,060 --> 01:52:00,540
It's really helped me,
but that's how much I learned about like

2319
01:52:00,541 --> 01:52:04,800
I now I don't have as much anxiety.
I breathe it out.

2320
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:08,820
It really fucking.
So I've done a lot of reading about it,

2321
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:11,940
but that guy's article,
but the guy that dipped the longest,

2322
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:13,770
his was the most interesting.

2323
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:17,070
I didn't know about the fucking license 
shit,

2324
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:18,240
but it's true,
man.

2325
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:23,270
Once you.
Now I'm rolling and now I pulled guard 

2326
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:25,530
with time just to be on my back.
I want to be fearful.

2327
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:27,190
Yeah.
So I just couldn't.

2328
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:29,820
I just look back whenever I have a 
problem.

2329
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:33,960
I do a thing called who got hula bowl 
that the Indians did Hulu,

2330
01:52:34,020 --> 01:52:35,250
where you look,
hookah,

2331
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:35,850
hookah,
Lou,

2332
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:36,930
something like that.
Oh,

2333
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:40,920
who could allow hookah lounge where you 
look up and you center again.

2334
01:52:41,010 --> 01:52:44,490
Yeah.
That's helped me become a better comment

2335
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:49,520
sometimes up there talking shit and just
center yourself and all these little 

2336
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:52,871
things I learned because I joined 
Jujitsu like my breathing or I focus on 

2337
01:52:52,871 --> 01:52:55,400
it when I rolled.
Now I don't care about hands no more.

2338
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:57,650
I don't care if you're choked me.
I really don't give a fuck.

2339
01:52:57,890 --> 01:53:00,410
I'm horrible anyway.
I'm just,

2340
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:03,470
I'm just learning to breathe all over 
it,

2341
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:06,590
you know,
I'm just learning to breathe,

2342
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:07,580
you know,
you know,

2343
01:53:07,581 --> 01:53:12,581
I was grabbing you and trying to go for 
a cross collar and then fucking like 

2344
01:53:12,581 --> 01:53:15,530
doing something completely different for
assistant sweep and somebody like Joe.

2345
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:18,090
You got to exhale brother.
Do you do,

2346
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:18,860
do,
do,

2347
01:53:19,130 --> 01:53:24,130
do a yoga for Jujitsu?
Don't they have a class like shit down 

2348
01:53:24,130 --> 01:53:24,130
at um,
schools?

2349
01:53:24,130 --> 01:53:24,350
Yeah,
yeah,

2350
01:53:24,351 --> 01:53:25,130
yeah,
we do.

2351
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:30,520
I go early.
What's the name of the actual thing is 

2352
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:33,551
called TAC fit.
But I go to yoga with my wife once a 

2353
01:53:33,551 --> 01:53:33,551
week.
We'd just go there.

2354
01:53:33,551 --> 01:53:37,270
She goes four times.
I just go with the Tuesday one just to 

2355
01:53:37,270 --> 01:53:39,320
loosen up from 10 to 11.
I'm not that good at it.

2356
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:44,380
My rich fit is our friends tack for this
or Scott Sewn and fuzzy when they 

2357
01:53:44,830 --> 01:53:47,260
realized who he did the podcast with me 
fucking happen.

2358
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:52,270
A tremendous workshop.
This wreck ain't fucking nine to five 

2359
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:52,980
every day.
Shit.

2360
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:54,890
Saturday and Sunday.
Are they teaching you?

2361
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:59,950
Kettlebells meets club bells with glossy
and how it affects Jujitsu and mma and 

2362
01:54:01,161 --> 01:54:06,161
stuff like that.
So last week I got to meet Scott Simon 

2363
01:54:06,161 --> 01:54:07,430
and boy,
he's fucking great joe.

2364
01:54:07,450 --> 01:54:09,970
He's got a lot of great stuff about 
bell's yes,

2365
01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:11,920
scraping some of his videos.
Listen,

2366
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:14,210
I'm up to the 20 pounds from Barbara.
Yeah.

2367
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:17,360
I started when I first got the club 
bells from heartbreak.

2368
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:22,840
My wrist was hurting with five pounds.
I couldn't even do the simple five 

2369
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:24,490
pounds one.
Now I'm taking twenties,

2370
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:26,570
holding them,
going all the way back,

2371
01:54:27,190 --> 01:54:30,200
bringing them back and it's all focused 
on my back and breathing.

2372
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:32,770
That's it.
I just threw shit to breathe.

2373
01:54:32,771 --> 01:54:36,650
Now I don't give a fuck if I get beat up
because that's what was really bothering

2374
01:54:36,651 --> 01:54:39,050
me was the breathing and maybe getting 
better at it.

2375
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:41,000
Yeah.
But now I'm getting better at it.

2376
01:54:41,001 --> 01:54:43,220
Plus the sleep apnea had put a lot of 
fear.

2377
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:46,550
So being on my back and being out of 
breath,

2378
01:54:46,551 --> 01:54:50,670
have sleep apnea would kick in again.
You got fucking,

2379
01:54:50,690 --> 01:54:51,530
you know.
So

2380
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:54,570
do you ever do those shield casts?
What's that?

2381
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:59,660
Remember the iron sheik.
Remember the iron sheik used to hold up 

2382
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:03,471
those gigantic,
a Iranian clubs that they would use for 

2383
01:55:03,471 --> 01:55:08,151
wrestling training.
It's like it was a really strong move 

2384
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:09,090
for wrestling training,
see if he could find what would the iron

2385
01:55:09,091 --> 01:55:13,080
sheik cause he was like the iron sheik 
people don't know.

2386
01:55:13,230 --> 01:55:18,230
He was a pro wrestler in the wwe.
He was wwf back then and you know,

2387
01:55:18,421 --> 01:55:23,421
he was before he was that he was a super
successful Iranian amateur wrestler.

2388
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:29,100
He was a legit wrestler,
like legit wrestling skills and 

2389
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:33,140
ridiculously strong and he's holding 
these things and I don't know how much 

2390
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:33,840
these things way,
but they,

2391
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:39,470
it doesn't look like he's faking this 
because of the slow motion of how he's 

2392
01:55:39,470 --> 01:55:41,190
moving in.
They look like heavy objects.

2393
01:55:41,370 --> 01:55:45,510
I don't know how much they weigh,
but this is a really hard workout to do.

2394
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:46,660
You know,
I,

2395
01:55:46,770 --> 01:55:51,180
I can barely do that shit with like 15 
pounds and I'm not bullshitting with one

2396
01:55:51,181 --> 01:55:52,710
hand.
It's hard.

2397
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:58,550
It's a weird control thing.
And you realize like how you're strong 

2398
01:55:58,550 --> 01:55:59,760
in certain areas as a definitely 
heaviest,

2399
01:56:00,150 --> 01:56:03,090
heaviest fuck yeah.
You're strong in certain areas.

2400
01:56:03,091 --> 01:56:06,030
Like that guy is super jacked.
Who is that?

2401
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:10,140
Got Beautiful underwear.
Um,

2402
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:15,470
but it's,
it's a very difficult thing because you 

2403
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:17,400
could be really strong when it comes to 
like a straight shoulder press,

2404
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:22,720
you know,
like you could like hoist up like 70 

2405
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:24,561
pounds,
but there's no fucking way in the world 

2406
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:24,561
you're going to be moving around 70 
pounds of fat.

2407
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:25,680
You're just,
you just can't do it.

2408
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:27,870
Your arm's going to fall off.
Like if you have,

2409
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:29,820
especially if you have it in the form of
a club,

2410
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:35,000
like you can't even get close.
Like I can do a lot of shit with heavy 

2411
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:35,000
kettle bells.

2412
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:35,610
But when it comes to like one of those 
clubs,

2413
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:38,730
I'd take two hands to move around a 30 
pound one,

2414
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:41,430
which is like if someone says like 30 
pounds,

2415
01:56:41,431 --> 01:56:44,220
like do you bench press $30 Bro.
That's all we got here.

2416
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:49,290
Thirty pounds bro.
I can't even get up pump doing something

2417
01:56:49,291 --> 01:56:53,160
with one of these clubs.
That's 30 pounds is fucking insane.

2418
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:55,620
Saying you have to be so God damn 
strong.

2419
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,920
And that sounds weird because it seems 
like,

2420
01:56:58,921 --> 01:57:03,921
well 30 pounds is 30 pounds,
but when you start swinging that shit 

2421
01:57:03,921 --> 01:57:06,741
over your head and it's long.
And so like the leverage is going 

2422
01:57:06,741 --> 01:57:08,190
against you look at him like a fucking 
bulldozer too.

2423
01:57:08,191 --> 01:57:13,191
He was a bulldozer guy that's on twitter
calling everybody and everybody's all my

2424
01:57:13,550 --> 01:57:14,780
dates,
Nazis.

2425
01:57:14,781 --> 01:57:16,650
I retweeted them the other day about 
Nazis.

2426
01:57:16,710 --> 01:57:19,590
I love him.
I was onstage with him in Toronto is one

2427
01:57:19,591 --> 01:57:24,591
of my favorite moments as a human calm 
people that you're bronies called 

2428
01:57:24,591 --> 01:57:26,880
everybody a piece of shit.
I fucking hated everybody.

2429
01:57:26,881 --> 01:57:30,060
He was a good man though.
And he was a stud wrestler.

2430
01:57:30,061 --> 01:57:35,061
But there's the dark secret of not just 
professional wrestling but of I'm just 

2431
01:57:36,601 --> 01:57:38,310
real high,
real high level grappling.

2432
01:57:38,510 --> 01:57:43,290
So the damage that gets done to a lot of
those guys bodies is almost unfixable.

2433
01:57:43,291 --> 01:57:45,070
And he's all fucked up now he's got,
you know,

2434
01:57:45,170 --> 01:57:47,070
like flares,
like not in a coma,

2435
01:57:47,071 --> 01:57:50,880
but in the last four or five days.
I heard about that.

2436
01:57:50,881 --> 01:57:51,960
And how old is Rick Flair?

2437
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:56,310
You know?
Um,

2438
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:58,470
they pay a price,
they pay a price to,

2439
01:57:58,730 --> 01:58:01,020
to entertain in that way,
know it's very,

2440
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:03,270
very physically violent.
It just,

2441
01:58:03,271 --> 01:58:06,360
because it's not quote unquote a real 
fight,

2442
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:11,480
whereas like there's an unplanned 
outcome and they're just throwing 

2443
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:11,480
haymakers at each other,
like a real mma fight.

2444
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:16,430
Just because it's not.
That doesn't mean that they're not 

2445
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:17,360
taking in a lot of damage.
Hit with those fucking forearms.

2446
01:58:17,361 --> 01:58:20,010
Shivers and dropped a fucking chair on 
them.

2447
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:25,220
Like all that shit is fucking them up.
A lot of them had brain damage to a lot 

2448
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:26,610
of it.
I'm sure there's no sugar,

2449
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:31,640
there's no studies on it,
but I'm sure I'm sure some of them 

2450
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:31,640
avoided it.
You know,

2451
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:33,710
some of them fought smart.
And what is he saying?

2452
01:58:33,711 --> 01:58:35,220
What is that boy saying?
His Song?

2453
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:38,250
I thought it was Halloween.
Well,

2454
01:58:38,251 --> 01:58:41,990
this is a drop bees silo.
What does

2455
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:43,450
he say?
Ghetto boys.

2456
01:58:46,910 --> 01:58:49,570
What was that like?
Oh my God,

2457
01:58:49,571 --> 01:58:51,850
I haven't heard that in so long.
What song is that?

2458
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:54,010
Oh,
it's a halloween song,

2459
01:58:54,030 --> 01:58:56,950
right?
We with chicken up the place.

2460
01:58:56,980 --> 01:59:00,040
What's that face?
Somebody playing tricks on me.

2461
01:59:00,041 --> 01:59:00,670
Yeah,
that's.

2462
01:59:00,671 --> 01:59:05,671
It wasn't no more than every seven feet,
whatever.

2463
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:12,290
We triple team them,
dropping them motherfucking bed.

2464
01:59:14,730 --> 01:59:17,320
The more I do,
the more I swung,

2465
01:59:17,321 --> 01:59:22,321
the more blood flow.
Debbie disappeared and then my boys 

2466
01:59:22,321 --> 01:59:24,030
disappeared too.
Wow.

2467
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:26,060
That's a classic man.
Oh my God.

2468
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:27,850
Bushwick bill.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2469
01:59:28,330 --> 01:59:33,330
remember the cover?
The cover of a ghetto boy CD is 

2470
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:38,610
Bushwick.
Bill with his eye shot out in the 

2471
01:59:38,610 --> 01:59:38,610
fucking.
Not,

2472
01:59:38,610 --> 01:59:39,280
not even this one.
It's another one in the Gurney.

2473
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:44,260
The hospital and it's like we can't be 
stopped.

2474
01:59:44,261 --> 01:59:47,760
Is the name of the album he got shot.
Delirious man.

2475
01:59:47,790 --> 01:59:49,030
I think he shot himself in the.

2476
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:50,770
I don't even know what the fuck 
happened.

2477
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:52,780
Someone shot him in the eye and he's 
like,

2478
01:59:52,781 --> 01:59:55,000
we can't be stopped.
And he's in the Gurney,

2479
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:56,140
like look at this.
Oh yeah,

2480
01:59:56,150 --> 01:59:57,430
right.
Damn.

2481
01:59:57,490 --> 01:59:59,560
Yeah.
So he's on the phone.

2482
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:04,860
He's got one of them breaks.
He's got one of them brick cell phones 

2483
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:07,500
from the olden days,
from back in the Gordon Gekko days.

2484
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:12,510
Guys on playing games and so he got shot
in the eye and while that's happening 

2485
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:18,300
he's on the phone doing deals.
Do deals still doing deals and it was 

2486
02:00:18,401 --> 02:00:21,380
the comments they had because they were 
pushing this.

2487
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:22,050
Whoa,
Whoa,

2488
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:24,340
whoa.
Why don't we pick up pictures?

2489
02:00:24,341 --> 02:00:26,320
We could put this up.
Yo.

2490
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:27,250
Yo.
Yo.

2491
02:00:27,251 --> 02:00:28,930
Yo.
We got to take a picture of this.

2492
02:00:28,950 --> 02:00:33,950
Let me take this off right quick.
Let me take this bandage off right 

2493
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:33,950
quick.
Oh my God,

2494
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:34,510
man.
Yeah.

2495
02:00:34,570 --> 02:00:36,280
The WHO's the midget?
That's,

2496
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:39,460
that's horrible nomenclature,
sir.

2497
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:45,320
I,
I don't think John Wesley,

2498
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:51,360
John Wesley,
and saw him fucking changing the flat 

2499
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:53,090
one to Houston and he pulled over to 
help Bushwick bill was.

2500
02:00:53,091 --> 02:00:54,970
How cool was that?
I helped Bushwick bill.

2501
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:55,510
I met.
Well,

2502
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:57,630
he did a show once he came to a show.
Didn't you?

2503
02:00:58,030 --> 02:00:59,680
Skipped one of my favorite quotes all 
the time.

2504
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:01,130
He got a little hobby of,
whoa.

2505
02:01:01,170 --> 02:01:02,860
It's totally.
He's totally right.

2506
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,120
And he really did.
Shoot is io really did.

2507
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:09,130
Oh yeah.
That wasn't a publicity stunt.

2508
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:11,380
Look at that.
Damn.

2509
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:12,400
That's crazy.

2510
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:19,460
Imagine that face walking up to you.
They were like at a store and just be 

2511
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:19,460
like,
I'm a celebrity.

2512
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:24,070
God fucking ice shot out.
They were fucking huge at one time.

2513
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:28,540
Geto boys for sure,
to live crew that we can't be stopped.

2514
02:01:28,690 --> 02:01:30,820
We can't be stopped as a big fucking 
album.

2515
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:33,430
They were huge.
No,

2516
02:01:33,930 --> 02:01:38,930
I used to listen to them when I was on 
the treadmill master a fucking 

2517
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:38,930
stairmaster things.
Whatever.

2518
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:40,070
The.
His rap a lot.

2519
02:01:40,071 --> 02:01:42,500
Right.
And isn't that the Houston a label?

2520
02:01:42,550 --> 02:01:44,630
Wasn't that rap a lot?
They put us on the map.

2521
02:01:44,890 --> 02:01:46,510
Rap a lot.
That's exactly what it was.

2522
02:01:48,370 --> 02:01:52,010
That's right.
Because the white dude with the teeth.

2523
02:01:52,430 --> 02:01:53,390
Oh,
Paul Wall.

2524
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:57,040
He still makes teeth.
Teeth.

2525
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,450
Does he make grills?
He makes great show.

2526
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:04,790
You should get Paul Wall grills.
We should all get grilled.

2527
02:02:04,820 --> 02:02:06,140
That's a good idea.
For Real.

2528
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:09,710
That's a great Christmas and some death 
squad was let.

2529
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:12,030
Let's fucking do it.
Will you do it please?

2530
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,350
Please do it.
How many teeth?

2531
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:16,820
How many teeth?
Let's just get a row,

2532
02:02:16,821 --> 02:02:20,460
man.
Let's just do around when we go to Paul.

2533
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,480
What's up Joe Rogan?
One thousand days.

2534
02:02:23,481 --> 02:02:24,920
You've got your lips.
No,

2535
02:02:24,921 --> 02:02:27,740
it's fine man.
What if it gets hooked up on your wife's

2536
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:29,890
push?
That's cool too.

2537
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:31,620
If it's diamonds should be fooled with 
it.

2538
02:02:35,210 --> 02:02:37,880
For the denture grills,
how much denture grills?

2539
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:39,740
Let's see that.
What's the cost on that?

2540
02:02:40,630 --> 02:02:44,230
Those are the ones you slide right off.
Fucking diamond grill cheese.

2541
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:46,850
What about people that want to be 
diamond page?

2542
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:49,100
Twenty 400.
That's not bad.

2543
02:02:49,490 --> 02:02:54,490
Twenty $400 for jewelry and your teeth.
Just to let everybody know you're not 

2544
02:02:54,490 --> 02:02:58,760
playing by any.
You're definitely right.

2545
02:02:58,761 --> 02:03:01,190
If you meet a dude and he's a number of 
gold teeth,

2546
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:04,550
like the number of gold teeth,
he as direct proportion as to whether or

2547
02:03:04,551 --> 02:03:05,950
not he's a pirate.
Dude,

2548
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:08,860
shoot your next special.
Wearing these motherfuckers.

2549
02:03:08,890 --> 02:03:10,610
Let people know what time it is,
man.

2550
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:15,880
I'm serious.
J R dot e dot and then put the name of 

2551
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:16,610
the special in the bottom.
I need a hype man.

2552
02:03:16,611 --> 02:03:21,611
I've been thinking to call you on this.
Would love to figure out like what's my 

2553
02:03:21,611 --> 02:03:22,640
best strategy.
I'm trying to hype out.

2554
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:28,060
Is that a word?
You know what I would do as soon as you 

2555
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:30,401
hit like a big punchline,
I will go and that was fucking funny to 

2556
02:03:30,650 --> 02:03:35,650
get them wrapped up.
You fucking John.

2557
02:03:37,150 --> 02:03:39,350
What he makes her.
You just showing up and going.

2558
02:03:39,351 --> 02:03:39,940
Yeah.
Yeah,

2559
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:44,300
a lot.
Like 50 grand fucking I'm sure man.

2560
02:03:44,330 --> 02:03:49,330
Well,
wasn't John Stays pay was like Paris 

2561
02:03:49,330 --> 02:03:52,090
Hilton was like,
one of the biggest things she had was 

2562
02:03:52,090 --> 02:03:53,590
like those nightclub appearances.
She'd go and they would just pay her the

2563
02:03:53,591 --> 02:03:54,380
money.
Yeah,

2564
02:03:54,381 --> 02:03:59,381
just to just show up and I ended up for 
some guy gave her a club.

2565
02:04:00,471 --> 02:04:05,471
It was called club Paris.
Every one was supposed to come show up 

2566
02:04:05,471 --> 02:04:05,471
and like she was supposed to be there 
every weekend.

2567
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:07,640
She's not going to Orlando every weekend
obviously.

2568
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:12,720
So is that the idea that he had?
How cooked up are you when you get in 

2569
02:04:12,890 --> 02:04:15,330
business with Paris Hilton?
I got an idea.

2570
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:20,210
I'm going to give her a club.
Is that cool?

2571
02:04:20,350 --> 02:04:21,530
They see it.
You see the connection.

2572
02:04:21,660 --> 02:04:23,720
If you're.
If you're hearing this guy who made that

2573
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:24,920
deal.
I'm sorry,

2574
02:04:24,921 --> 02:04:29,921
I'm just joking around.
I don't really think that one day we'll 

2575
02:04:29,921 --> 02:04:31,970
fucking that like when we first go into 
the comedy store sunset,

2576
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:36,110
when you hit Laurel Canyon,
it was bumper to bumper traffic.

2577
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:37,560
Right?
Okay.

2578
02:04:37,561 --> 02:04:38,190
It was bumper

2579
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:43,190
to bumper traffic.
I remember getting a ticket one time 

2580
02:04:43,190 --> 02:04:43,800
because I had my spot was up.
I just want it in the Middle Lane.

2581
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:46,800
There was a cop right there.
Fucking wait with me by the standard,

2582
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:53,040
you know,
that was when Hilton and what's the 

2583
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:53,190
other chick that was getting in trouble?
Lindsay Lohan.

2584
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:57,510
She's got locked out every fucking nice 
true causing problems.

2585
02:04:57,511 --> 02:05:01,470
And then Lindsay Lohan and went to the 
griddle before court.

2586
02:05:01,471 --> 02:05:05,220
One day she went to that place that we 
went to the breakfast place,

2587
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:07,680
a good place and that was it.
After that,

2588
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:12,840
the griddle was packed for fucking 
months after that because people found 

2589
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:16,620
out lindsay was only going there for 
breakfast every morning and they had 

2590
02:05:16,620 --> 02:05:17,790
those crazy pancakes.
Pancakes.

2591
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:22,820
I mean,
but I'm saying that it's like 18 

2592
02:05:22,820 --> 02:05:24,771
pancakes.
I'm wondering like there's your pancake 

2593
02:05:24,771 --> 02:05:24,771
nuts kill you,
kill you.

2594
02:05:24,771 --> 02:05:29,090
Take care of for you.
Like 15 years ago there was French 

2595
02:05:29,810 --> 02:05:29,810
Press.

2596
02:05:29,970 --> 02:05:32,710
They were fucking years ago.
Yeah,

2597
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:33,210
friends.
Yeah.

2598
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:35,820
Fifteen years ago.
They had coffee from Hawaii there.

2599
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:39,390
They were doing a good job there.
I just don't like waiting on line.

2600
02:05:39,391 --> 02:05:40,110
Fags,
Bro.

2601
02:05:40,140 --> 02:05:45,140
I'm anti waiting on line.
I'm not waiting in line for a 

2602
02:05:45,140 --> 02:05:47,610
restaurant.
I mean when something kind of reasonable

2603
02:05:47,611 --> 02:05:49,210
fine.
Obviously it's like your table.

2604
02:05:49,220 --> 02:05:50,850
You don't have a table used to hang out,
but when they're like,

2605
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:53,210
this place is awesome.
Just hour and a half now.

2606
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:58,310
Ever done.
Franklin's barbecue in Austin stayed in 

2607
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,570
line.
I'm not paying somebody $8 an hour.

2608
02:06:00,810 --> 02:06:04,620
Get My fucking hell and come out and get
more fucking waitresses.

2609
02:06:04,910 --> 02:06:06,840
The one cent hamburger place,
they do it.

2610
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:11,850
They got people out there I don't like.
I think it's just a place to be cool.

2611
02:06:12,150 --> 02:06:15,660
Some people sit there for eight bucks an
hour for you already likes that Shit.

2612
02:06:15,870 --> 02:06:17,700
Doesn't sit in there and listen.
Nothing.

2613
02:06:17,701 --> 02:06:18,630
I don't want to wait for nothing.

2614
02:06:18,930 --> 02:06:21,270
When I go to breakfast and Hollywood,
if I got to go to the doctor,

2615
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:25,350
I stopped by the griddle first before I 
get there.

2616
02:06:25,860 --> 02:06:28,950
It's still a little wine,
but if they give me any drama,

2617
02:06:28,951 --> 02:06:33,951
there's a Bagel place across the street 
that's tremendous to get a nice clean 

2618
02:06:33,951 --> 02:06:36,000
Turkey,
bobby that make fresh Turkey and pull on

2619
02:06:36,001 --> 02:06:39,000
your Bagel,
bobby and he fucking around Jack.

2620
02:06:39,001 --> 02:06:41,850
The best wizard job at all.
Hollywood is pinks.

2621
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:43,960
Yeah.
That's the worst day.

2622
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:47,360
They are damned wizard.
Horrific.

2623
02:06:47,470 --> 02:06:52,470
I remember horrific coming like moving 
here to the first thing you do and 

2624
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:52,470
you're like,
wow,

2625
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:54,460
I hit that spot.
That line again.

2626
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:58,650
You get one of those hot dogs.
He went all dark during the hot dogs.

2627
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:01,800
No,
actually you actually bought into it and

2628
02:07:01,801 --> 02:07:02,970
you're like,
this is amazing.

2629
02:07:03,330 --> 02:07:04,770
And then.
Well then you take.

2630
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,060
Then you take another bite and you're 
like,

2631
02:07:06,061 --> 02:07:06,390
no,
I,

2632
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:11,480
I just,
I just hype myself wanting to take a 

2633
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:11,480
minute.
Yeah,

2634
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:11,480
but listen,
fuck us.

2635
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:12,760
That place is crowded every God damn 
near every day.

2636
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:18,620
No.
It's about cooking outdoors to having 

2637
02:07:18,620 --> 02:07:21,891
that open window.
When she walked by and you could see 

2638
02:07:21,891 --> 02:07:24,831
them cooking the hot dogs.
I went in there and the buttons were 

2639
02:07:24,831 --> 02:07:26,460
pink.
The bunge were yellow.

2640
02:07:26,900 --> 02:07:30,480
The Chili was God awful.
You know what the problem is?

2641
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:35,780
God awful.
The real problem for me is always going 

2642
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:36,550
to be that I've had real New York

2643
02:07:36,550 --> 02:07:41,550
hot dog snap when you bite them bread,
you know there's those type of hot dogs 

2644
02:07:41,891 --> 02:07:45,250
that they were making.
The buns were perfect.

2645
02:07:45,870 --> 02:07:49,190
Lungs go so far with Burgers,
amazing things,

2646
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:54,680
but there's something about when you 
snap into one of those and you taste 

2647
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:58,021
that real fresh,
real delicious hot dog tastes like a 

2648
02:07:58,021 --> 02:08:00,520
regular bullshit hot dogs.
They just don't fly anymore.

2649
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:05,760
Like when you go to dodger stadium,
those are the worst hot dog ever know 

2650
02:08:05,790 --> 02:08:09,370
Adam curls and some sort of a beef with 
fans about that.

2651
02:08:09,490 --> 02:08:11,780
If a dog's,
it's God awful.

2652
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:14,260
It's like you read.
Don't feel from American Airlines.

2653
02:08:14,660 --> 02:08:19,660
Think you're poisoning yourself.
Every time I get the oatmeal from 

2654
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:19,660
America and I'm like,
am I fucking poison?

2655
02:08:20,740 --> 02:08:24,640
Those dodger dogs are so fucking bad.
They're horrible.

2656
02:08:24,641 --> 02:08:26,890
I don't give a fuck what anybody says 
when I was in the

2657
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:32,530
from junior year.
Uh,

2658
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:33,520
what's that word?

2659
02:08:34,330 --> 02:08:38,890
Excoriates.
He excoriates the dodger dog.

2660
02:08:38,891 --> 02:08:42,560
Implores ramps to serve better beef.
What does that word have you ever used?

2661
02:08:42,890 --> 02:08:44,180
Lord,
wow,

2662
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:47,360
whoever you are,
word wizard of Google.

2663
02:08:48,890 --> 02:08:53,890
My junior year in high school,
Mr Hildebrand took us to the fucking sad

2664
02:08:54,621 --> 02:08:59,621
brett place to take this through a 
little walk,

2665
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:05,640
you know,
because his job was to do is to every 

2666
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:07,190
month to show is different career 
opportunities and we went to this,

2667
02:09:07,191 --> 02:09:10,280
this hotdog thing that like we had to 
take a bus down there.

2668
02:09:11,450 --> 02:09:12,980
Have you ever seen that?
No.

2669
02:09:13,010 --> 02:09:17,510
Okay.
So this for Puerto Rican and about boobs

2670
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:20,540
and they got yellow suits on and they 
got those boots on.

2671
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:24,150
Okay.
And there's a fucking I could,

2672
02:09:24,380 --> 02:09:29,380
you know when you're working on a 
construction site and you throw the 

2673
02:09:29,380 --> 02:09:31,841
sheet rock in the tube and the tube goes
down to the first floor into the 

2674
02:09:31,841 --> 02:09:31,841
dumpster.
Okay.

2675
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:37,060
So there's a tube like that.
And then this for Puerto Ricans were 

2676
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:41,480
brewing and then six Puerto Rican with 
bags of 80 pounds.

2677
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:45,620
Ninety pounds salt.
This is back in 1980.

2678
02:09:45,830 --> 02:09:50,830
Okay.
Ninety pounds and there's pallets of 90 

2679
02:09:50,830 --> 02:09:54,311
pounds at every once in a while,
but light turns red and this thing just 

2680
02:09:54,311 --> 02:09:57,800
body parts start falling heads,
shoulders,

2681
02:09:57,830 --> 02:10:01,340
eyeballs.
You just see it and then these guys,

2682
02:10:01,390 --> 02:10:06,390
the other Puerto Rican break the bags of
salt and put them on this shit that's 

2683
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:10,470
folly,
like it's not stopped and these guys 

2684
02:10:10,470 --> 02:10:14,021
sweep that into a fucking hole and 
that's how the hot dog gets.

2685
02:10:15,710 --> 02:10:18,720
But it's everything.
It's the leg the whole time,

2686
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:20,600
you know?
What do you think?

2687
02:10:20,780 --> 02:10:23,290
What happens to her leg when somebody 
gets into a car?

2688
02:10:23,310 --> 02:10:25,840
So the four or five when you think 
happens to the leg,

2689
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:27,820
you think they'd take it home?
Fuck No.

2690
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:32,050
They call Hormel Hormel.
We got a black leg for you.

2691
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:33,680
It's about three pounds.

2692
02:10:34,690 --> 02:10:38,240
I will call you back in five minutes.
Then they call white castle lizard,

2693
02:10:38,510 --> 02:10:43,510
but we have a deal for you.
Then they hang up with him and they call

2694
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:50,780
state comes and they send that Lego 
thing do with that big fucking leg that 

2695
02:10:51,411 --> 02:10:54,800
weighs 300 pounds.
You think they just put that leg away?

2696
02:10:54,801 --> 02:10:56,060
Fuck no,
that's you.

2697
02:10:56,740 --> 02:11:00,500
Could you imagine if they found out that
people were,

2698
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:02,410
were grinding up people,
they found them

2699
02:11:02,590 --> 02:11:07,340
morgue dogs.
If that was true,

2700
02:11:07,740 --> 02:11:12,740
the male will kill him and he had a 
friend that had a supermarket but owed 

2701
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:16,460
them money,
so at night he'd go kill them in the 

2702
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:18,761
supermarket and put them in the meat 
grinder and the next day people come in 

2703
02:11:18,761 --> 02:11:22,151
and put that meet.
What the fuck were you eating when it 

2704
02:11:22,151 --> 02:11:24,670
was over in net?
Fuck he ground Plato's leftover in 

2705
02:11:24,670 --> 02:11:24,670
there?
Yeah,

2706
02:11:24,670 --> 02:11:29,141
for a couple of a couple of his murders.
He had a guy that don't want the money 

2707
02:11:29,141 --> 02:11:30,710
for Shylock and he was like a.
It wasn't any training.

2708
02:11:30,711 --> 02:11:33,620
People training people training them 
upside down and training people.

2709
02:11:34,070 --> 02:11:36,670
The other guy from the Gambia and I was 
on the chain

2710
02:11:36,790 --> 02:11:39,640
supermarkets,
you know that.

2711
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:44,760
That was the guy from the gambling.
The other guy from the Gambinos owned 

2712
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:46,390
great web,
great white auto memo.

2713
02:11:46,650 --> 02:11:49,490
When you're in queens and shit,
they have those people that balance your

2714
02:11:49,491 --> 02:11:54,491
tires and shit.
All them was that bought into legit 

2715
02:11:54,491 --> 02:11:55,080
businesses.
That was a good way to declare income.

2716
02:11:55,110 --> 02:11:57,440
Yeah.
I think I had the guy that the the heavy

2717
02:11:57,441 --> 02:12:00,500
guy conti is something.
That guy was a known heroine dealer.

2718
02:12:00,501 --> 02:12:05,501
He was on the board of Director of news 
bombs of a supermarket you want me to 

2719
02:12:05,501 --> 02:12:09,071
say with this motherfucker that they had
about 30 rest their head about 30 

2720
02:12:09,071 --> 02:12:13,130
supermarkets in the Jersey area and one 
day he just called local two.

2721
02:12:13,131 --> 02:12:14,570
Oh,
two carpenters and said,

2722
02:12:14,571 --> 02:12:19,571
do me a favor,
go to every supermarket and add an 

2723
02:12:19,571 --> 02:12:19,571
aisle.

2724
02:12:20,740 --> 02:12:25,740
So every supermarket had an aisle that 
whatever they took went directly to the 

2725
02:12:26,031 --> 02:12:27,400
mom.
But.

2726
02:12:27,650 --> 02:12:31,130
So they had 13 supermarkets were like on
number five,

2727
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:34,280
wasn't really on number five.
Nobody knew about number five.

2728
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:39,940
So whatever was bought in that aisle,
that cash went upstairs for 13 

2729
02:12:40,041 --> 02:12:45,041
supermarkets on a daily basis.
They would just go into a supermarket 

2730
02:12:45,041 --> 02:12:49,450
and it had two lanes go.
We don't even worry about those two 

2731
02:12:49,450 --> 02:12:49,450
lights.
Wow.

2732
02:12:49,450 --> 02:12:51,350
How fucking bizarre is that?
Yeah.

2733
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:52,910
Yeah.
Just,

2734
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:57,350
it's crazy that the FBI,
all the people,

2735
02:12:57,650 --> 02:13:01,040
various law enforcement organizations 
figuring out a way to crack that,

2736
02:13:01,110 --> 02:13:06,110
break it down.
They cracked it after they made 10 

2737
02:13:06,110 --> 02:13:06,110
million.
Then they cracked it.

2738
02:13:06,110 --> 02:13:06,730
You know,
lives in studio city,

2739
02:13:06,750 --> 02:13:07,340
Bro,
who?

2740
02:13:07,550 --> 02:13:09,860
I just met him at the coffee shop about 
three months ago.

2741
02:13:09,861 --> 02:13:14,360
And I talk to them all the time and I'm 
about to sic 'em loose on people sick.

2742
02:13:14,370 --> 02:13:18,560
I'm loose on people who.
The last godfather in this country was a

2743
02:13:18,561 --> 02:13:20,930
guy by the name of Joe,
something big fat guy.

2744
02:13:21,230 --> 02:13:24,440
He came out and he may never be shut.
He was fucking genius.

2745
02:13:24,441 --> 02:13:26,360
Joe came out of jail,
man,

2746
02:13:26,361 --> 02:13:27,890
everybody's shut.
The social clubs,

2747
02:13:27,891 --> 02:13:31,440
everybody had to have a job.
Everybody had to have a job,

2748
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:33,710
no drugs.
Everybody stuck to it.

2749
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:37,060
They were doing phenomenal.
He was doing phenomenal Joe Massino,

2750
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:41,520
but somebody was shaking down a 
restaurant and he went in there and they

2751
02:13:41,521 --> 02:13:45,060
were giving him $20,000
a week for security.

2752
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:50,280
So they couldn't figure out how to get 
Messina because he wasn't doing anything

2753
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:54,330
outside.
And they got this forensic accountant to

2754
02:13:54,331 --> 02:13:56,640
go in there and they shut down the mine.
This guy,

2755
02:13:56,641 --> 02:13:59,550
well this guy retired lives in fucking 
studio city.

2756
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:02,520
We were talking to one day goes for a 
thousand bucks.

2757
02:14:02,730 --> 02:14:03,960
So it gives you a hard time.

2758
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:08,190
You have the right to go in there and 
look at their books.

2759
02:14:08,910 --> 02:14:09,810
He goes,
don't bring.

2760
02:14:09,811 --> 02:14:10,800
No,
he's fucking white.

2761
02:14:10,801 --> 02:14:15,801
It is from Hollywood,
bring me because I'll find everything in

2762
02:14:15,811 --> 02:14:17,280
there.
Plus I'm making a deal.

2763
02:14:17,281 --> 02:14:21,720
If they don't pay it,
I call my friends at the fucking irs and

2764
02:14:21,721 --> 02:14:24,580
I will have him here within a day 
looking through your ass hole.

2765
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:28,390
So we're ready to sick mother fuckers.
I got one guy I'm ready to say,

2766
02:14:28,391 --> 02:14:30,060
come on.
He keeps telling me,

2767
02:14:30,061 --> 02:14:31,170
Oh,
we haven't made any money.

2768
02:14:31,171 --> 02:14:36,171
Keep it up.
Keep it up because I'm going to stick 

2769
02:14:36,171 --> 02:14:36,171
this little fucking.
And this guy is one of those.

2770
02:14:36,171 --> 02:14:38,820
He's not even Jewish.
He's just crazy and white,

2771
02:14:39,660 --> 02:14:44,660
but for a thousand bucks he'll go in 
there and he was the same guy that 

2772
02:14:44,660 --> 02:14:45,360
brought down thousands of people for the
FBI.

2773
02:14:45,630 --> 02:14:49,650
When they can't figure you out forensic 
accounting,

2774
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:52,650
you're done the math better add up Jack 
Jesus.

2775
02:14:52,680 --> 02:14:57,680
Correct.
So anybody who gives you guys a hard 

2776
02:14:57,680 --> 02:14:57,680
time,
we don't know.

2777
02:14:57,680 --> 02:15:00,390
We haven't sold a lot of them.
Thousand Bucks and he'll go in there and

2778
02:15:00,391 --> 02:15:02,070
he's fucking.
When you look at him,

2779
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:06,390
he's one of those white dudes that did 
30 years in the marines that he's pretty

2780
02:15:06,391 --> 02:15:07,230
serious.
He goes,

2781
02:15:07,231 --> 02:15:09,750
I'll rip them fucking open for you.
Oh,

2782
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:14,600
I'll find every dime and then I'll make 
them an offer they can't refuse that.

2783
02:15:14,610 --> 02:15:17,640
They got three days to give you a check 
for the UN,

2784
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:22,700
whatever.
Or we contact our buddies and the irs 

2785
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:26,331
now having met in 24 hours to look in 
your asshole until they find something 

2786
02:15:26,331 --> 02:15:27,750
or is that true?
Can you really do that?

2787
02:15:28,470 --> 02:15:30,240
Whatever the fuck you call the irs and 
go,

2788
02:15:30,241 --> 02:15:35,241
hey man,
watch your ass or wait till you see the 

2789
02:15:35,241 --> 02:15:38,001
end of the year.
We went to all these people who've been 

2790
02:15:38,001 --> 02:15:38,001
talking shit about trump.

2791
02:15:38,001 --> 02:15:41,270
You think Kathy Griffin's they're not 
going to get harassed and anybody else 

2792
02:15:41,270 --> 02:15:44,570
you watch.
I don't trust trump when it comes to 

2793
02:15:44,570 --> 02:15:46,791
something like that.
I'm not saying he's a bad dude or 

2794
02:15:46,791 --> 02:15:48,891
anything like that,
but I'm saying is trump's one of those 

2795
02:15:48,891 --> 02:15:48,891
dudes.
You really don't want to mess with it.

2796
02:15:48,891 --> 02:15:53,780
I believe that.
I believe that if people want to put 

2797
02:15:53,780 --> 02:15:54,090
pressure on you,
they could get you to the irs.

2798
02:15:54,091 --> 02:15:56,220
I think agencies had been doing it for 
years.

2799
02:15:56,550 --> 02:16:01,550
I shouldn't even trump.
What did you guys think of this 

2800
02:16:01,550 --> 02:16:01,550
Charlottesville stuff and his reaction 
to it?

2801
02:16:01,710 --> 02:16:04,170
I think he's just a big failure man.
I mean he.

2802
02:16:04,190 --> 02:16:09,190
What was he,
what did you feel like when he fumbled 

2803
02:16:09,190 --> 02:16:10,440
on what I thought was two levels,
like,

2804
02:16:10,441 --> 02:16:14,070
so there's the,
there's the leadership like presidential

2805
02:16:14,071 --> 02:16:15,600
level,
right where you go,

2806
02:16:15,601 --> 02:16:19,560
like this is the office that we look to 
and then there's the person.

2807
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:23,250
So I think he,
it's weird how he makes,

2808
02:16:23,251 --> 02:16:24,690
you know,
everything is about him.

2809
02:16:25,050 --> 02:16:29,470
And he even started one of those press 
conferences and it went like

2810
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:31,890
how the economy's doing.
So like,

2811
02:16:32,110 --> 02:16:36,940
I think it's hard to view that dude 
morally as somebody that you're,

2812
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:40,690
I don't know that you would enjoy being 
around as a person.

2813
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:43,150
And then I get,
I actually,

2814
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:45,850
I get what he was trying to do.
I do to,

2815
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:46,600
with his,
uh,

2816
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:49,400
uh,
criticizing and tif and stuff like I,

2817
02:16:49,410 --> 02:16:50,280
I,
you know,

2818
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:55,380
I get it,
but like it's the lack of savviness is 

2819
02:16:55,380 --> 02:16:59,941
even maybe more like in,
in not knowing like this is a time where

2820
02:16:59,981 --> 02:17:03,280
you do this and not that,
that's also something you're like,

2821
02:17:03,281 --> 02:17:08,281
wow.
Like he just just feels like it's 

2822
02:17:08,281 --> 02:17:11,010
totally unfit for the job in my opinion,
while I also feel like when you're,

2823
02:17:12,300 --> 02:17:17,300
when you're the president,
the workload must be impossible to 

2824
02:17:17,300 --> 02:17:21,061
imagine before you get in there and then
once you get in there you're dealing 

2825
02:17:21,061 --> 02:17:24,871
with all these pressures,
all these super important decisions and 

2826
02:17:24,871 --> 02:17:26,680
all these different areas and then some 
new shit comes up.

2827
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:27,970
I've,
I really think,

2828
02:17:27,971 --> 02:17:30,430
and I'm not even seeing this as a 
critical of like I don't like him.

2829
02:17:30,670 --> 02:17:35,670
I really think he is the only a few 
other people can experience this is 

2830
02:17:36,010 --> 02:17:38,710
truly like,
Holy Shit with what this job entails.

2831
02:17:38,930 --> 02:17:43,930
I think so too.
I think it's really like one of those 

2832
02:17:43,930 --> 02:17:43,930
things where he's like,
wow.

2833
02:17:43,930 --> 02:17:48,130
And you can see that he's constantly.
Like he always refers to the campaign 

2834
02:17:48,130 --> 02:17:51,461
still always in any conversation we'll 
talk about like I beat those guys 

2835
02:17:51,500 --> 02:17:53,230
because I think that's the part that he 
enjoyed.

2836
02:17:53,231 --> 02:17:57,270
He enjoyed the competition days of the 
campaign and I think like,

2837
02:17:57,520 --> 02:18:00,130
and then you know,
he's always bringing up like the new.

2838
02:18:00,410 --> 02:18:03,220
But the dad was setting records for for 
months and months and months,

2839
02:18:03,221 --> 02:18:08,221
but like he'll still tweets will be 
about that or interviews will be about 

2840
02:18:08,221 --> 02:18:10,780
that.
He can't not make a conversation,

2841
02:18:11,050 --> 02:18:12,690
a statement with talking to.

2842
02:18:12,730 --> 02:18:15,360
It probably is a connection though 
between the Dow,

2843
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:20,460
the up and him being an office and 
people thinking that he's friendly to 

2844
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:20,460
business to business markets.
Love it.

2845
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:25,291
There's definitely no doubt about that.
But there's also no doubt that 

2846
02:18:25,291 --> 02:18:28,080
unemployment was at record lows and 
setting records beforehand and the Dow 

2847
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:30,370
has been breaking.
Has been on an upswing for years now.

2848
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:35,460
Isn't that how it always is?
Like presidents always come in and take 

2849
02:18:35,460 --> 02:18:35,570
advantage of the upward.
There's,

2850
02:18:35,810 --> 02:18:40,810
of course he's not the first highly 
predictive bucket that the economy does 

2851
02:18:40,810 --> 02:18:41,680
come in.
These ebbs and flows.

2852
02:18:41,770 --> 02:18:43,690
It does come in,
abs and flows in the market.

2853
02:18:44,170 --> 02:18:49,170
Inevitably,
at least in in the history of it always 

2854
02:18:49,170 --> 02:18:49,170
comes back,
always comes back.

2855
02:18:49,170 --> 02:18:49,170
You know,
if you.

2856
02:18:49,170 --> 02:18:51,760
Even if you stayed through like black 
Monday,

2857
02:18:51,761 --> 02:18:56,761
if you.
The market's still eventually comes 

2858
02:18:56,761 --> 02:18:59,431
back.
I'm too stupid to understand that I'm 

2859
02:18:59,431 --> 02:18:59,431
too stupid to get the market.

2860
02:18:59,431 --> 02:18:59,431
You know you're not.
No,

2861
02:18:59,431 --> 02:18:59,530
no,
no.

2862
02:18:59,531 --> 02:19:04,531
I mean I am in the sense that I'm not 
really interested in pursuing those 

2863
02:19:04,531 --> 02:19:04,531
lines of thought.
I get that.

2864
02:19:04,531 --> 02:19:05,530
That's different.
My brain is just like,

2865
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:08,770
yeah,
that seems like a pot of shit to me.

2866
02:19:08,771 --> 02:19:11,500
I gotta get Outta here.
If I tell you I to believe this,

2867
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:16,800
I don't know if it happened.
Market Street from white supremacists.

2868
02:19:16,850 --> 02:19:17,990
Somebody showed up.
Oh,

2869
02:19:18,430 --> 02:19:20,920
I don't pay attention to disconnect with
myself.

2870
02:19:21,510 --> 02:19:24,890
I don't watch world my whole life.
I tell you what happened.

2871
02:19:24,970 --> 02:19:27,970
Let me tell you what happens is through 
photo

2872
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:33,000
shoots,
they finished goods is that spray that 

2873
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,010
makes everybody gay that they put on 
frogs.

2874
02:19:34,011 --> 02:19:35,920
They're now using at j.
crew like you know,

2875
02:19:35,921 --> 02:19:39,720
like Abercrombie and Fitch does as you 
walk in and they hit you with that.

2876
02:19:39,880 --> 02:19:42,170
That gay frog spray you.
What I'm talking about,

2877
02:19:42,610 --> 02:19:47,610
it makes you guys.
So a bunch of dudes got crazy tattooed 

2878
02:19:47,610 --> 02:19:49,070
swastikas on themselves,
took their shirts off.

2879
02:19:50,030 --> 02:19:55,030
They're all walking around with 
citronella candles that they got from 

2880
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:57,791
like a hardware store.
That was the stupidest part of it all 

2881
02:19:57,791 --> 02:19:57,791
they had,
they had like torches out.

2882
02:19:57,791 --> 02:20:00,320
They're walking on the street with like,
come on,

2883
02:20:00,321 --> 02:20:02,930
you guys are walking around with lawn 
torches,

2884
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:08,020
pussies.
They didn't even make the Frankenstein 

2885
02:20:08,020 --> 02:20:09,701
one where you get the fucking blame,
the fucking gas run and chase to go 

2886
02:20:11,130 --> 02:20:14,180
fucking mosquito repellency shit.
Listen dog.

2887
02:20:14,210 --> 02:20:16,640
I tell you what this is.
You know what man?

2888
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:20,720
I have so many things on my plate.
I had to stop watching.

2889
02:20:21,150 --> 02:20:22,460
Tell you something else.
I,

2890
02:20:22,461 --> 02:20:27,170
I had to sit in my wife down like a man 
and tell about csm.

2891
02:20:27,171 --> 02:20:32,171
BC was not allowed of the house no more.
My wife is very political and I had to 

2892
02:20:32,171 --> 02:20:33,890
cut her off like I can't have too much 
drama.

2893
02:20:34,140 --> 02:20:36,590
It's overwhelming.
I can't have the tools to the table,

2894
02:20:36,830 --> 02:20:41,830
you know,
we would go out to dinner and somebody 

2895
02:20:41,830 --> 02:20:41,930
would bring something up and I had to 
kick her under the table and I feel bad.

2896
02:20:41,990 --> 02:20:44,000
Let's not talk about that shit.
Yeah.

2897
02:20:44,170 --> 02:20:45,280
There's no reason.
You know,

2898
02:20:45,290 --> 02:20:47,290
how you hear that expression more than,
you know,

2899
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:50,970
as a kid where people were like never 
bring up politics or religion,

2900
02:20:50,990 --> 02:20:51,860
religion.
Right.

2901
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:54,560
And as a kid you're like,
I don't understand why that,

2902
02:20:54,590 --> 02:20:57,500
but this is,
I feel like the age where it becomes the

2903
02:20:57,501 --> 02:20:58,730
most clear and,
and at,

2904
02:20:58,820 --> 02:21:00,710
at the time where you're like,
oh,

2905
02:21:00,711 --> 02:21:05,711
I told we can actually probably have a 
good time if no one talks about these 

2906
02:21:05,711 --> 02:21:05,711
things.

2907
02:21:05,711 --> 02:21:10,230
And it always comes up guys.
You can't see for people talk for five 

2908
02:21:10,230 --> 02:21:12,500
minutes about anything without somebody 
bringing something up political.

2909
02:21:12,980 --> 02:21:14,390
And you know what?
At the end of the week,

2910
02:21:14,391 --> 02:21:16,250
dog,
you still gotta get up and go to work.

2911
02:21:16,251 --> 02:21:19,010
You still gotta get up her groceries.
She still gotta wipe your ass.

2912
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:24,380
All of this knowledge and gops and slds.
I grew up in Hudson county,

2913
02:21:24,381 --> 02:21:27,230
New Jersey,
which comes into the Cook County,

2914
02:21:27,231 --> 02:21:28,350
Illinois.
Yeah.

2915
02:21:28,430 --> 02:21:32,680
So I learned about politics and a micro.
What's a smaller one?

2916
02:21:32,730 --> 02:21:36,350
Micro.
And it's a horrible thing.

2917
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:39,080
I benefited from it.
I had no show jobs.

2918
02:21:39,380 --> 02:21:41,210
I had to rip down,
show jobs.

2919
02:21:41,630 --> 02:21:45,320
I had a no show job at harvest med 
school when I was a kid going there once

2920
02:21:45,321 --> 02:21:47,800
a week and pick up a check and laugh at 
the old Japanese.

2921
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:49,790
I didn't.
I never moved the desk,

2922
02:21:50,270 --> 02:21:52,580
no Karma and got me the job,
got arrested.

2923
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:55,100
So.
But it's a,

2924
02:21:55,400 --> 02:21:57,530
I saw the level.
It never interested me.

2925
02:21:58,180 --> 02:22:03,180
Like I was like,
these people fucking pukes they're 

2926
02:22:03,180 --> 02:22:03,180
fucking puke.
Zoot suits on.

2927
02:22:03,180 --> 02:22:07,950
You know,
before you guys were talking about 

2928
02:22:07,950 --> 02:22:09,521
taxpayer pay money,
I want to see the agenda for the 12 

2929
02:22:09,521 --> 02:22:13,631
fucking idiots that sit there with suits
to the old and white and they sit there 

2930
02:22:13,631 --> 02:22:17,660
and 12 hours to make a decision.
That's where our money goes.

2931
02:22:17,710 --> 02:22:18,470
Yeah.
You know,

2932
02:22:18,471 --> 02:22:22,400
you don't know about bureaucracy till my
mother died.

2933
02:22:22,430 --> 02:22:24,830
That's where I learned about bureaucracy
to 4:15.

2934
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:27,360
That's why I don't like it because my 
mother died.

2935
02:22:27,361 --> 02:22:32,361
I couldn't even collect social security 
without coming up with 92 sheets of 

2936
02:22:32,361 --> 02:22:33,750
paper.
That's a fucking social security number.

2937
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:36,450
That's a fucking name.
And that's when she died.

2938
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:39,180
And that's an exit ticket.
Give me my fucking money.

2939
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:41,460
Oh No.
Oh No.

2940
02:22:41,910 --> 02:22:42,900
It's another letter.

2941
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:45,960
And another meeting,
and you paid your taxes,

2942
02:22:46,470 --> 02:22:50,490
you paid for this.
This is your fucking harder than money.

2943
02:22:50,850 --> 02:22:53,430
That's when you learn that it's all 
bullshit.

2944
02:22:53,530 --> 02:22:57,930
And this is all bullshit.
We are taxed in four years.

2945
02:22:57,931 --> 02:23:02,931
Your kids are gonna.
Come through and go daddy or your 

2946
02:23:02,931 --> 02:23:02,931
daughter's gonna come to you and go,
I want to play basketball.

2947
02:23:03,720 --> 02:23:08,720
You take them down there.
If they charge you 85 to sign up dirty 

2948
02:23:09,451 --> 02:23:14,451
too for the shirt,
which really is worth fucking $8 on a 

2949
02:23:14,451 --> 02:23:16,140
fucking in the black market.
And then you gotta pay the sneakers,

2950
02:23:16,141 --> 02:23:18,540
which are $100.
When I was a kid though,

2951
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:20,670
Texas willow,
I went to union city.

2952
02:23:20,671 --> 02:23:23,220
I told him I want to play basketball.
They put you on a team,

2953
02:23:23,221 --> 02:23:26,880
they give you a shirt and you played 
every week for free.

2954
02:23:26,881 --> 02:23:29,460
It didn't cost you anything.
Look at the fucking.

2955
02:23:29,461 --> 02:23:33,000
I don't even know about taxes or 
anything Joe.

2956
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:38,240
All I know about is when I go buy a 
plane ticket and I look at those prices 

2957
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:42,561
and I go,
what about the family or to that isn't 

2958
02:23:42,561 --> 02:23:42,561
doing that well?
Yeah.

2959
02:23:42,561 --> 02:23:43,560
What about the fucking,
if I was,

2960
02:23:43,561 --> 02:23:48,561
if I was really a tax or have felonies,
I can't vote so I don't even let that 

2961
02:23:49,291 --> 02:23:54,291
thing on my mind.
What about the $50 I got to pay for 

2962
02:23:54,291 --> 02:23:54,570
parking when I go to a UFC event?
Yeah.

2963
02:23:54,750 --> 02:23:59,750
What about the $184 for a fucking lake?
A ticket with a $100 for a fucking 

2964
02:24:01,141 --> 02:24:02,580
baseball ticket.
When does it end?

2965
02:24:02,610 --> 02:24:05,970
That's what I'm concerned about.
I don't give a fuck about anything else.

2966
02:24:06,270 --> 02:24:09,780
I want them to bomb fucking isis now 
today.

2967
02:24:10,890 --> 02:24:15,890
But everything else for me applies to 
the American family that the American 

2968
02:24:15,890 --> 02:24:17,250
family does not stand a chance in this 
country no more.

2969
02:24:17,580 --> 02:24:21,170
If your wife works and you have to pay 
date care,

2970
02:24:22,050 --> 02:24:22,920
what are you bringing home?

2971
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:25,170
What are you clearing after daycare?
Right.

2972
02:24:25,290 --> 02:24:29,520
Somebody was telling me for summer camp 
in studio city,

2973
02:24:30,150 --> 02:24:35,150
it's $200 a week.
That's $800 a month for the average 

2974
02:24:35,281 --> 02:24:40,281
person.
What's the average person making this 

2975
02:24:40,281 --> 02:24:40,281
fucking country?
Joe Rogan.

2976
02:24:40,281 --> 02:24:43,970
So your taxes are getting used for shit.
I taxes are getting used for shit shit 

2977
02:24:48,390 --> 02:24:52,530
because they're not going to where 
they're supposed to go $800 a month.

2978
02:24:52,531 --> 02:24:53,280
It's like,
what is that?

2979
02:24:53,281 --> 02:24:57,180
Like 900 $9,600
a year.

2980
02:24:57,330 --> 02:25:00,660
So a lot of money,
but for fucking and the girl was telling

2981
02:25:00,661 --> 02:25:05,661
me that her son has to volunteer and 
help other kids to get that rate city 

2982
02:25:06,571 --> 02:25:10,860
and I just was telling them,
kindergarten at monarch is 30,

2983
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:15,900
$34,000.
What is in the valley and you know,

2984
02:25:15,901 --> 02:25:20,901
don't even mind.
The other two were the daughter went to 

2985
02:25:20,901 --> 02:25:20,901
school.
I'm like,

2986
02:25:20,901 --> 02:25:20,901
ah,
oh.

2987
02:25:20,901 --> 02:25:21,540
And by the way,
we're talking about all this.

2988
02:25:21,541 --> 02:25:23,830
Like it's a big deal.
If we were living in Manhattan,

2989
02:25:23,831 --> 02:25:24,030
there'll

2990
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:27,070
be a goddamn bark.
Was a bargain bargain.

2991
02:25:27,310 --> 02:25:29,320
That's what I.
What I think about politics,

2992
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:34,680
I think about people who are fucking 
struggling that have two children and 

2993
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:37,480
they can't go to a dodger game with a 
fucking baseball games you go to.

2994
02:25:37,530 --> 02:25:40,570
As a kid.
I can't tell you how many I went to as a

2995
02:25:40,571 --> 02:25:41,450
kid.
Yeah.

2996
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:45,430
But with these families cannot afford a 
dodger game,

2997
02:25:45,970 --> 02:25:47,530
bro.
I'm a fucking savage.

2998
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:49,420
My uncle loves baseball.
He's on old man.

2999
02:25:49,421 --> 02:25:54,421
I would go to costco and for $50 I get 
two tickets to hotdogs to sodas and a 

3000
02:25:54,421 --> 02:25:56,770
parking spot.
I don't care about the fucking game.

3001
02:25:56,771 --> 02:26:00,430
I take can be 74.
Once magic took over the dodgers,

3002
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:02,820
they don't give you that deal no more.
You don't want.

3003
02:26:02,850 --> 02:26:05,710
It seems like.
It's like if you have a giant population

3004
02:26:05,711 --> 02:26:09,390
like we do in La and a something like a 
dodger take care of someone,

3005
02:26:09,430 --> 02:26:11,140
even though it's a giant number of 
people,

3006
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:14,860
it's still a small percentage of this 
huge population.

3007
02:26:14,860 --> 02:26:17,050
I guess they just realize anybody does 
this,

3008
02:26:17,150 --> 02:26:21,550
realizes he just jack it up higher.
You're going to get a smaller percentage

3009
02:26:21,551 --> 02:26:22,780
people,
but there's still enough people,

3010
02:26:22,781 --> 02:26:23,680
right?
Exactly.

3011
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:25,960
Like why would we do that?
Let's do that.

3012
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:31,440
Let's just make more and then if you.
You know how it is when you go to a 

3013
02:26:31,440 --> 02:26:31,990
theater or something like that,
it's got to be twice that.

3014
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:37,020
If there's some sort of a baseball game 
or something like that or one of those 

3015
02:26:37,020 --> 02:26:41,040
huge stadiums,
they about all the people that have to 

3016
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:43,261
get paid.
All the people that are working there 

3017
02:26:43,261 --> 02:26:45,181
while you're working.
They're like giant staff of humans that 

3018
02:26:45,181 --> 02:26:45,250
have to keep that thing running smooth.
Yeah.

3019
02:26:45,251 --> 02:26:48,850
What about the American family that 
flies a water?

3020
02:26:49,330 --> 02:26:52,760
It's $4 and fifty cents for bottled 
water recharging.

3021
02:26:52,870 --> 02:26:54,680
I thought water was free.
They give you a cup of water,

3022
02:26:54,750 --> 02:26:55,750
a cup of water.

3023
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:58,180
What if and then when you go through 
Tsa,

3024
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:01,160
you can't bring the water through.
You can't,

3025
02:27:01,170 --> 02:27:06,170
but you can.
You can buy water on the other side of 

3026
02:27:06,170 --> 02:27:09,071
the sun.
If Joe Rogan you just barely getting by 

3027
02:27:09,071 --> 02:27:10,660
and you have three fucking kids and it's
$3 a fucking water.

3028
02:27:10,850 --> 02:27:13,750
I mean that's the shit that has always 
concerned me.

3029
02:27:13,780 --> 02:27:18,780
I can break small guy.
The fucking guy that wants to take the 

3030
02:27:18,780 --> 02:27:18,780
guy that works,
he's divorced.

3031
02:27:18,780 --> 02:27:23,311
He pays child support.
He wants to take his kid to a dodger 

3032
02:27:23,311 --> 02:27:26,191
game and for him to get a ticket,
he's got to sit with gang bangers and 

3033
02:27:26,191 --> 02:27:28,320
wear a helmet and a fucking nodding God 
fucking suit and you know,

3034
02:27:28,330 --> 02:27:30,700
you can smoke pot and I just stayed 
really.

3035
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:32,330
There's a little section,
supposedly the,

3036
02:27:32,680 --> 02:27:35,070
you walk to the left and people's 
parking over there.

3037
02:27:35,340 --> 02:27:40,340
Is that through?
Let's just pretend that it make it 

3038
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:40,340
happen.

3039
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:40,540
Just do it,
man.

3040
02:27:40,630 --> 02:27:42,160
If anybody would let it go.
It's La,

3041
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:43,510
right?
Yeah.

3042
02:27:43,570 --> 02:27:45,890
He's got more tolerance for weeds and La
is.

3043
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:48,190
Did you see that video?
I don't know where the fuck it happened.

3044
02:27:48,191 --> 02:27:51,550
I think it was on the instagram feed.
Clowning the homie.

3045
02:27:51,670 --> 02:27:56,670
I don't know if you know that one.
They always have some fun stuff up 

3046
02:27:56,670 --> 02:27:59,941
there,
but there's a big giant white guy was a 

3047
02:27:59,941 --> 02:28:00,100
black cop.
Beats the fuck out of them.

3048
02:28:00,101 --> 02:28:02,800
Tasers them pizza.
Fuck out of him with a club.

3049
02:28:03,010 --> 02:28:05,530
And then uh,
eventually they tasered him from behind.

3050
02:28:05,531 --> 02:28:07,750
Another guy got him and he fell and 
banged his head off the ground.

3051
02:28:07,960 --> 02:28:09,200
And the whole time the guy was saying 
like,

3052
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:11,320
I am not fighting you,
I'm not fighting you.

3053
02:28:11,321 --> 02:28:16,321
And they're just beating on him with 
this fucking that job.

3054
02:28:16,390 --> 02:28:19,870
And I've said it a million times is not 
for everybody.

3055
02:28:19,870 --> 02:28:22,430
And it's one of the most difficult jobs 
in the world.

3056
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:23,480
Being a cop.
Yup.

3057
02:28:23,540 --> 02:28:24,920
Yeah.
And what we're seeing,

3058
02:28:24,930 --> 02:28:28,280
we're seeing that guy that shot that 
woman in the alley,

3059
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:31,500
this guy getting beat up by this metal 
pipe.

3060
02:28:31,580 --> 02:28:34,730
Baltimore cops planting evidence,
plant drugs.

3061
02:28:34,731 --> 02:28:36,620
How long have you known me Joe Rogan?
Twenty years.

3062
02:28:36,621 --> 02:28:38,180
I did time.
Now they use a verb.

3063
02:28:38,360 --> 02:28:39,640
Ever,
ever,

3064
02:28:39,910 --> 02:28:42,410
ever heard me say some crazy shit.
Crazy shit.

3065
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:44,390
But you've never heard me say the word 
pig.

3066
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:50,520
No,
I have the most respect for police 

3067
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:50,520
officers.
It's a small percentage of people.

3068
02:28:50,520 --> 02:28:53,630
A stressful job,
but something's going on now.

3069
02:28:53,810 --> 02:28:56,060
It's not just stressful.
What about two days ago,

3070
02:28:56,061 --> 02:28:58,790
the minutes with the gun to the black 
couple,

3071
02:28:58,820 --> 02:29:01,070
while he was getting his license and 
they kept saying,

3072
02:29:01,071 --> 02:29:03,650
please put the gun away and the guy held
the gun.

3073
02:29:03,651 --> 02:29:05,230
There is shit.
This is.

3074
02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:08,750
And then I love when if they shoot a 
black person,

3075
02:29:08,990 --> 02:29:11,240
they just get like the black da that go 
up there and say,

3076
02:29:11,241 --> 02:29:14,780
well we looked at this year,
be up that black metallic cat downtown,

3077
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:17,170
eight cops to beat up a black retard.

3078
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:22,540
And then the fucking kid died.
And they said it's a fucking black kids 

3079
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:22,540
fault.
He's fucking retarded.

3080
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:26,720
Eight cops on top of him beating them.
But this goes on constantly and you know

3081
02:29:26,721 --> 02:29:29,330
what's going to happen and you fucking 
know what's going to happen.

3082
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:31,400
You know exactly what's going to fucking
happen.

3083
02:29:31,700 --> 02:29:35,390
Two or three years from now,
all it takes is three angry black guys,

3084
02:29:36,260 --> 02:29:38,990
three angry black guys with a surplus to
spread the word.

3085
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:44,200
It was done with the Black Panthers.
It was dunphy is three angry back like 

3086
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:45,680
black guys.
And they're going to fucking start going

3087
02:29:45,681 --> 02:29:48,290
around in the cities and saying there's 
a fire.

3088
02:29:48,500 --> 02:29:51,170
And with all these cops show up,
they're going to be on Ruby's.

3089
02:29:51,171 --> 02:29:56,171
And they gotta open up on them.
This is going to happen in American 

3090
02:29:56,171 --> 02:29:56,840
cities.
Some reading happened after Dallas,

3091
02:29:58,320 --> 02:30:03,320
Dallas,
that was so don't fucking tell me this 

3092
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:03,320
is going to happen.

3093
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:05,390
Three black guys that went through the 
service that got weapons,

3094
02:30:05,450 --> 02:30:07,580
like I told you,
unless you're retarded,

3095
02:30:07,581 --> 02:30:09,050
you can't get weapons to that.
I get,

3096
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:14,080
I get you.
Whatever the fuck you want and 

3097
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:14,080
something.
I get you something in an hour,

3098
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:14,390
an hour,
I'll get you something to go fight.

3099
02:30:14,510 --> 02:30:16,100
I believe you,
so nevermind.

3100
02:30:16,550 --> 02:30:21,550
Assault rifles and shit like that.
That's all you need is five assault 

3101
02:30:21,550 --> 02:30:25,361
rifles and say that a woman is getting 
raped at the end of the fucking a 

3102
02:30:25,361 --> 02:30:28,040
Cherokee Street and wait for 20 cops to 
come and open up on them.

3103
02:30:28,041 --> 02:30:31,010
Dogs all headshots,
headshots and leg shots.

3104
02:30:31,430 --> 02:30:34,370
That's going to happen eventually 
because this cannot continue.

3105
02:30:34,850 --> 02:30:39,850
This cannot continue.
I think most people that become cops 

3106
02:30:39,850 --> 02:30:44,290
have a very difficult time doing it.
I think for some people it's 

3107
02:30:44,290 --> 02:30:47,681
unmanageable and I think if you think 
about all the interactions and all the 

3108
02:30:47,681 --> 02:30:49,880
police officers have with all the people
all day long,

3109
02:30:49,910 --> 02:30:54,910
all across the country,
the vast majority of it is 

3110
02:30:54,910 --> 02:30:54,910
inconsequential.
It's people,

3111
02:30:54,950 --> 02:30:57,530
traffic violations,
little things here and there,

3112
02:30:57,800 --> 02:31:00,860
but there's going to be a percentage.
What is that percentage?

3113
02:31:00,861 --> 02:31:02,780
Is it even one percent?
I don't know what it is,

3114
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:06,380
but if that one percent gets online,
we focused on that one percent,

3115
02:31:06,530 --> 02:31:11,530
so whether it's that guy planting drugs 
in Baltimore or these guys beating up 

3116
02:31:11,530 --> 02:31:15,941
this giant white guy was giant,
but he wasn't threatening them in any 

3117
02:31:15,941 --> 02:31:16,010
way.
Just didn't want these guys like fucking

3118
02:31:16,011 --> 02:31:20,130
danger in them and I think there's just 
way

3119
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:23,690
too few people that are capable of 
navigating the waters,

3120
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:27,450
the waters of that kind of job.
I think that kind of job is almost.

3121
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:32,130
It's almost as bad or as difficult 
rather as a being in the military.

3122
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:36,150
Your life is on the line.
You're at risk all the time.

3123
02:31:36,210 --> 02:31:38,550
Constantly.
You know when people will call you a cop

3124
02:31:38,551 --> 02:31:40,200
apologists,
if you look at it like that.

3125
02:31:40,620 --> 02:31:42,240
Listen man,
if this shit goes down,

3126
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:44,580
someone's breaking into your house,
you're calling the cops,

3127
02:31:44,581 --> 02:31:45,630
man.
Okay.

3128
02:31:45,631 --> 02:31:50,631
That's what they're here for.
And to pretend that you don't need them 

3129
02:31:50,631 --> 02:31:50,631
as well.
Okay.

3130
02:31:50,631 --> 02:31:54,210
Maybe someday we will,
but right now you need cops for sure,

3131
02:31:55,220 --> 02:32:00,220
and definitely they need each other.
They need cops to and they know it and 

3132
02:32:00,220 --> 02:32:04,371
they and they see it more than you do 
because they're the ones who respond to 

3133
02:32:04,371 --> 02:32:05,310
murderers and armed robberies and rapes.

3134
02:32:05,430 --> 02:32:10,430
They're the ones who have to show up and
handle car accidents on the highway 

3135
02:32:10,430 --> 02:32:10,920
with.
I mean how much special training do they

3136
02:32:10,921 --> 02:32:14,370
have that they get to deal with bodies 
that are torn apart for how much special

3137
02:32:14,371 --> 02:32:15,100
training?
No,

3138
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:16,170
I know.
I'm not sure.

3139
02:32:16,530 --> 02:32:19,740
I'm not sure you could even adequately 
train a person.

3140
02:32:20,130 --> 02:32:21,630
Some people can handle it,
period,

3141
02:32:22,020 --> 02:32:27,020
but there's some people they see some 
dark shit and they just don't recover 

3142
02:32:27,020 --> 02:32:31,550
and then you ask those people to just 
keep pulling people over and I also 

3143
02:32:31,550 --> 02:32:31,620
think that they should train the cops a 
little more.

3144
02:32:31,950 --> 02:32:33,870
I see a lot.
I don't think they have the money.

3145
02:32:34,230 --> 02:32:36,240
I say I agree with you.
I agree with you.

3146
02:32:36,480 --> 02:32:40,860
I see a lot of dumb shit in La Times.
You're on Hollywood boulevard,

3147
02:32:40,940 --> 02:32:45,940
bumper to bumper,
and you go to see what it is and it's a 

3148
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:45,940
fucking cop double park.

3149
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:47,800
Given a homeless guy a hard time pull 
the carpet.

3150
02:32:47,810 --> 02:32:50,010
You pull the car with you fucking 
scumbag.

3151
02:32:50,300 --> 02:32:52,560
Can't you tell at 4:00
when this fucking traffic?

3152
02:32:52,561 --> 02:32:54,090
They don't care.
They don't give a fuck.

3153
02:32:54,270 --> 02:32:59,270
You know what?
One day I yelled from the car and they 

3154
02:32:59,270 --> 02:32:59,270
looked at me.
I yell,

3155
02:32:59,270 --> 02:32:59,430
really?
Guys,

3156
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:01,770
eight in the morning,
double fucking parked.

3157
02:33:02,310 --> 02:33:07,310
Really no fucking genius here.
And there's smoke coming out of his 

3158
02:33:07,310 --> 02:33:09,160
mouth while he's screaming,
I'll fucking kill you.

3159
02:33:09,270 --> 02:33:11,490
You think I'm fucking kidding me?
I say Shit,

3160
02:33:11,700 --> 02:33:12,540
because it's true.
Come on.

3161
02:33:12,541 --> 02:33:13,580
It's common sense.
Yeah,

3162
02:33:13,590 --> 02:33:18,590
of course.
You want to give me a ticket when we go 

3163
02:33:18,590 --> 02:33:20,151
to court,
we'll talk about and now we all got 

3164
02:33:20,151 --> 02:33:21,981
phones now.
We all gotta fucking phones and videos 

3165
02:33:21,981 --> 02:33:22,410
and the whole fuck.
That's who it's very dangerous.

3166
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:25,050
Is these laws against people filming 
cops were.

3167
02:33:25,051 --> 02:33:27,150
They're doing shit like you can't have 
that.

3168
02:33:27,320 --> 02:33:28,520
No.
Is that really a lot of them?

3169
02:33:28,530 --> 02:33:33,530
Yes it is.
There are several places where it is 

3170
02:33:33,530 --> 02:33:34,760
illegal to film cops while they're doing
things.

3171
02:33:35,130 --> 02:33:37,110
Find,
make federally.

3172
02:33:37,111 --> 02:33:42,111
It's not know for sure.
The police have tried to tell people 

3173
02:33:42,111 --> 02:33:46,601
it's not,
but I'm pretty sure my spreading fake 

3174
02:33:46,601 --> 02:33:46,601
news.
I know that they can.

3175
02:33:46,601 --> 02:33:48,340
Let's find out if that's the case.
Um,

3176
02:33:48,690 --> 02:33:53,690
are there places where it's illegal to 
film the cops and know they can tell 

3177
02:33:53,690 --> 02:33:54,510
you?
Like if there's a situation going down,

3178
02:33:54,570 --> 02:33:55,850
I felt like I was lying when I said 
that,

3179
02:33:56,280 --> 02:34:01,280
that you can,
they can tell you that they need a 

3180
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:01,280
certain,
like a bit of space,

3181
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:01,920
but I don't think they can tell you to 
stop filming.

3182
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:03,130
Hmm.
That's interesting.

3183
02:34:03,290 --> 02:34:08,290
I tried to go to Vegas and there was all
vacation and there were these fucking 

3184
02:34:09,420 --> 02:34:14,420
smart kids and the cops kept telling 
them they had to get off and they would 

3185
02:34:14,420 --> 02:34:18,051
take,
they would shoot him the cops and 

3186
02:34:18,051 --> 02:34:18,051
telling them that it was there.

3187
02:34:18,051 --> 02:34:18,051
Right.
Here we go.

3188
02:34:18,051 --> 02:34:22,860
Taking photographs and videos of things 
that are plainly visible and public 

3189
02:34:22,860 --> 02:34:26,041
spaces as a constitutional right.
And that includes police and other 

3190
02:34:26,041 --> 02:34:26,041
government officials carrying out their 
duties.

3191
02:34:26,041 --> 02:34:30,331
However,
there is a widespread and continuing 

3192
02:34:30,331 --> 02:34:32,641
pattern of law enforcement officers 
ordering people to stop taking 

3193
02:34:32,641 --> 02:34:34,210
photographs or video in public places 
and harassing,

3194
02:34:34,211 --> 02:34:39,211
detaining and arresting those who fail 
to comply the right of citizens to 

3195
02:34:39,211 --> 02:34:40,840
record the police as a critical check 
and balance.

3196
02:34:40,841 --> 02:34:43,120
It creates an independent record of what
took place in,

3197
02:34:43,360 --> 02:34:45,370
in a particular incident.
Okay.

3198
02:34:45,371 --> 02:34:46,160
Well that.
That's.

3199
02:34:46,660 --> 02:34:51,660
So that seems like maybe what I was 
reading was about people that got 

3200
02:34:51,660 --> 02:34:56,371
arrested for it.
So the cops were arresting him for but 

3201
02:34:56,371 --> 02:34:59,041
he doesn't even though it's not really 
illegal and they can still arrest you 

3202
02:34:59,041 --> 02:35:01,771
for a lot of things,
then you go to court and you figure out 

3203
02:35:01,771 --> 02:35:03,460
the arrest and so if a cop arrest you 
for not listening to him.

3204
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:04,640
So like if you're.
If,

3205
02:35:04,660 --> 02:35:09,660
if say save a cop is arresting someone 
and you're filming it because he's 

3206
02:35:09,660 --> 02:35:12,391
kicking this guy's ass and you start 
filming it and the cop says if you do 

3207
02:35:12,391 --> 02:35:15,721
not put that camera down,
I will arrest you and they can still 

3208
02:35:15,721 --> 02:35:18,301
arrest you.
They could say you're obstructing 

3209
02:35:18,301 --> 02:35:19,621
justice or I would say not to turn the 
camera with who's doing something wrong.

3210
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:21,670
Well,
so I got you there.

3211
02:35:21,671 --> 02:35:26,671
Right.
It's like fucking hard to stay on the 

3212
02:35:26,671 --> 02:35:27,130
right path and not go straight dirty 
Harry.

3213
02:35:27,131 --> 02:35:28,750
If some guy's trying to kill you and 
you're,

3214
02:35:28,751 --> 02:35:29,400
you're,
you know,

3215
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:32,560
you're involved in some situation and 
then you see people filming it too.

3216
02:35:33,430 --> 02:35:38,430
Fuck man.
I wouldn't want to navigate any of the 

3217
02:35:38,430 --> 02:35:39,280
shit that cops have to go through on a 
daily basis,

3218
02:35:40,570 --> 02:35:41,370
but they also have

3219
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:46,700
to clean it up a little bit and when 
they do something wrong and we watch it 

3220
02:35:49,721 --> 02:35:54,721
on film,
they can't tell us that the cop was 

3221
02:35:54,721 --> 02:35:54,721
justified to do something.
Of course.

3222
02:35:54,721 --> 02:35:56,580
Suddenly there was a lot of shit going 
on that.

3223
02:35:56,650 --> 02:35:59,520
I mean there was 37 murders in Chicago 
last weekend.

3224
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:04,560
What did that fuck?
Somebody shooting murder or something 

3225
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:06,670
crazy like in those places.
A high level.

3226
02:36:06,671 --> 02:36:11,671
But there's a lot of times I've seen 
cops act a little too much for what the 

3227
02:36:12,191 --> 02:36:17,191
situation.
Cause where I grew up in Jersey were 

3228
02:36:17,191 --> 02:36:17,290
cops come in and they talked to you.
They asked you,

3229
02:36:17,291 --> 02:36:21,880
they separate you and they determine if 
this was even worth the fucking angle.

3230
02:36:22,420 --> 02:36:24,880
These guys today,
they'll come in,

3231
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:30,120
even if we do something at the store,
they'll come into the store and 

3232
02:36:30,120 --> 02:36:31,580
investigate them for what you do.
Go fucking chase,

3233
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:33,430
chase bank robber.

3234
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:38,730
The day after nine slash 11,
I pulled into fucking seven slash 11 and

3235
02:36:38,890 --> 02:36:41,260
a guy had pulled over the line.
Okay.

3236
02:36:41,730 --> 02:36:43,600
You know,
was called pulled over the line.

3237
02:36:43,601 --> 02:36:48,601
So my car was over the line.
The guy next to me and the whole cars I 

3238
02:36:48,601 --> 02:36:52,261
pulled in,
I was six inches over a handicap thing 

3239
02:36:52,261 --> 02:36:55,290
on the Blue Line,
cut and made au turn and came and gave 

3240
02:36:55,290 --> 02:36:56,050
me a $458.
I understood I was wrong,

3241
02:36:56,051 --> 02:36:58,000
but when we just blow up the World Trade
Center.

3242
02:36:58,180 --> 02:36:59,800
Yeah.
You ain't got nothing better to do.

3243
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:05,140
You ain't got nothing better to do.
You know,

3244
02:37:05,141 --> 02:37:09,640
I see fucking Kinky shit all the fucking
time if I'm not involved with it.

3245
02:37:09,940 --> 02:37:11,200
So it's got nothing to do with me

3246
02:37:12,150 --> 02:37:15,260
copses there's a statistic number that 
they have to reach,

3247
02:37:15,261 --> 02:37:20,261
right?
Like if they believed that certain 

3248
02:37:20,261 --> 02:37:20,390
amount of traffic violations taking 
place in la,

3249
02:37:20,830 --> 02:37:25,830
there's a strong influence on those guys
to write a certain amount of tickets,

3250
02:37:26,780 --> 02:37:30,080
whether you'd call it a quota anymore 
because I think those things are shawn.

3251
02:37:30,090 --> 02:37:31,980
They say they don't have a quota,
but they have something.

3252
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:37,790
They're out there.
There's some severe incentive and if you

3253
02:37:37,791 --> 02:37:42,791
don't meet the numbers that they expect 
and they in some way shape or form.

3254
02:37:42,921 --> 02:37:47,921
Thank you.
Are Not addressing some of the crimes 

3255
02:37:47,921 --> 02:37:48,830
that are being committed out there.
I'm sure you get a hard time for it.

3256
02:37:48,890 --> 02:37:51,020
Listen brother,
when I got arrested in [inaudible] 87,

3257
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:54,380
that detective,
that fucking moron from bolden,

3258
02:37:54,950 --> 02:37:56,780
who I liked,
you know,

3259
02:37:56,840 --> 02:38:00,260
he got me for four years and he thought 
he was fucking what?

3260
02:38:00,410 --> 02:38:01,000
You know,
like when,

3261
02:38:01,570 --> 02:38:03,200
like when they,
when they locked up,

3262
02:38:03,330 --> 02:38:05,930
Godaddy,
the Teflon Don,

3263
02:38:06,230 --> 02:38:10,250
he loved you by.
You could have gotten me for 22 years if

3264
02:38:10,251 --> 02:38:15,251
you've done your homework.
If that couple is just a little bit,

3265
02:38:15,630 --> 02:38:18,830
he would have done 22 years.
You don't know how many times I sat next

3266
02:38:18,831 --> 02:38:20,720
to him at the preliminary hearing and 
I'm like,

3267
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:23,930
hold this dude doing rug reminds me,
Oh,

3268
02:38:23,990 --> 02:38:28,990
you don't like him?
Because he had come to talk to me about 

3269
02:38:28,990 --> 02:38:28,990
something else,
the same fucking cop a year earlier,

3270
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:32,030
put it together and that would have got 
me more in the kidnapping,

3271
02:38:32,990 --> 02:38:35,720
so every time I saw this cop I would sit
there at the end.

3272
02:38:36,170 --> 02:38:41,170
I would just call them like a big dope 
because he was six foot four with the 

3273
02:38:41,170 --> 02:38:42,050
big chest,
with the bulletproof.

3274
02:38:42,051 --> 02:38:46,080
Your thumbing around like you fucking 
know it.

3275
02:38:46,090 --> 02:38:49,370
You're talking to me.
It's like that fucking kid.

3276
02:38:49,371 --> 02:38:53,240
A couple of weeks ago that pushed that 
fucking little Mexican hot dog cart.

3277
02:38:53,960 --> 02:38:55,980
You'll never hear from him again.
Who?

3278
02:38:55,990 --> 02:39:00,080
That little Argentenians dude that 
pushed that little Mexican dude with the

3279
02:39:00,170 --> 02:39:05,170
fruit cart when talking about.
We're talking about see that Jesus 

3280
02:39:05,170 --> 02:39:05,540
Christ,
Joe Rogan,

3281
02:39:05,660 --> 02:39:10,580
watch lions attacking a monkey,
but you haven't seen somebody that way a

3282
02:39:10,581 --> 02:39:15,581
couple of weeks ago with some poor 
little Mexican dude was selling hotdogs 

3283
02:39:15,581 --> 02:39:19,120
on the corner and some fucking little.
He thought he was one of those dudes 

3284
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:20,420
with the skinny jeans,
with a guns and roses shirt.

3285
02:39:20,660 --> 02:39:21,770
Him and his fat,
white,

3286
02:39:21,771 --> 02:39:25,100
ugly fucking girlfriend went up to the 
dude and told them to move.

3287
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:30,640
You never saw this.
They told him to move man harassing a 

3288
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:31,880
food vendor flipping over.
Oh my God.

3289
02:39:31,881 --> 02:39:33,200
Joe Rogan.
Huh?

3290
02:39:33,350 --> 02:39:36,680
Look at this fucking jerk off looking 
with a dog.

3291
02:39:36,710 --> 02:39:38,090
You can tell he's a fucking punch him.

3292
02:39:41,620 --> 02:39:42,900
What happened?
Watch.

3293
02:39:46,120 --> 02:39:51,120
He told him to move a little speck kid.
Turns out his camera.

3294
02:39:57,400 --> 02:39:58,660
Do you want to move it?
Why?

3295
02:39:58,690 --> 02:39:59,930
Because he's fucking he.
Well,

3296
02:39:59,931 --> 02:40:03,340
he's a skinny Jean guy with that dirty,
filthy white animal.

3297
02:40:03,341 --> 02:40:06,220
Have a girlfriend.
So he wants to be a tough guy.

3298
02:40:06,221 --> 02:40:08,290
Was Fidel Watch what happens though.

3299
02:40:19,180 --> 02:40:23,970
Mexicans through that red pepper right 
his fucking face.

3300
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:26,220
And I didn't mind it.
Look,

3301
02:40:26,250 --> 02:40:31,250
this is what we're calling the police.
That dude had a pickup and move.

3302
02:40:37,441 --> 02:40:39,750
Let me tell you what those colors.
You see those carts with the umbrellas.

3303
02:40:40,030 --> 02:40:45,030
How would you noticed a lot more of 
those carts that have the rainbow 

3304
02:40:45,030 --> 02:40:45,030
umbrella?
Thompson,

3305
02:40:45,030 --> 02:40:45,300
the girl.
I've seen a few.

3306
02:40:45,360 --> 02:40:46,260
You know why?
No,

3307
02:40:46,310 --> 02:40:49,770
that the cartel really remember years 
ago when you first moved to La,

3308
02:40:49,771 --> 02:40:52,140
that was star maps.
What's going on here at the rest of it?

3309
02:40:52,141 --> 02:40:53,550
Jamie got it.
Takes off his shirt.

3310
02:40:53,551 --> 02:40:54,930
Did they get in a fight after this?
No,

3311
02:40:54,931 --> 02:40:57,750
he fucking threw the pepper riders face 
the fucking hot pepper.

3312
02:40:58,170 --> 02:41:00,240
Tremendous.
He just took his shirt off.

3313
02:41:00,330 --> 02:41:03,450
Yeah.
She because he threw pepper in his face.

3314
02:41:03,451 --> 02:41:05,430
A little funny.
Still hanging out like right there.

3315
02:41:05,431 --> 02:41:07,890
It's weird because they thought the cops
are going to come.

3316
02:41:07,890 --> 02:41:09,720
People came to help this little Mexican 
dude,

3317
02:41:10,140 --> 02:41:15,140
but that dude had to leave town with 
this fat fucking disgusting filthy 

3318
02:41:15,140 --> 02:41:18,150
girlfriend hygiene because you don't run
into those things.

3319
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:20,590
The cartel.
That's why you see so many more voices.

3320
02:41:20,670 --> 02:41:22,650
He didn't like it.
They just didn't want them there because

3321
02:41:22,651 --> 02:41:27,651
it's like silver lake and he's special.
He's a white dude with the skinny jeans.

3322
02:41:30,110 --> 02:41:31,570
Baggy fucking thugged out,
be it.

3323
02:41:31,650 --> 02:41:32,760
You know what?
I've known this man.

3324
02:41:32,761 --> 02:41:37,761
There's a lot of people that think that 
it's okay to be aggressive because 

3325
02:41:37,761 --> 02:41:42,651
they're in the right,
but didn't you say during the right dog 

3326
02:41:42,651 --> 02:41:43,100
dog,
dog,

3327
02:41:43,350 --> 02:41:45,450
ain't nothing going to go down.
That's a pussy.

3328
02:41:45,451 --> 02:41:47,730
That dude was a pussy.
That poor kid.

3329
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:53,120
Let me tell you something.
The cocktail brings the coke cup and 

3330
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:53,120
fruit.
They chop up the fruit.

3331
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:54,120
Then they sell the fruit.
They don't make.

3332
02:41:54,300 --> 02:41:58,050
They don't make a loss.
They have these new umbrellas everywhere

3333
02:41:58,440 --> 02:42:01,260
and they have them even across the 
street from each other.

3334
02:42:01,530 --> 02:42:06,530
They don't sell drugs.
That's what they make the cash drop 

3335
02:42:06,530 --> 02:42:06,530
offs.
I've had people see him all the way from

3336
02:42:06,530 --> 02:42:09,410
San Diego all the way to fucking receive
it.

3337
02:42:09,780 --> 02:42:12,150
They're all on the main strips and they 
were all confused.

3338
02:42:12,180 --> 02:42:13,950
That's why they were around.
She said,

3339
02:42:14,020 --> 02:42:15,020
Da,
don't catch them.

3340
02:42:15,030 --> 02:42:20,030
They don't drop off drugs.
They just drop off an envelope with a 

3341
02:42:20,030 --> 02:42:20,030
number on it.
Number eight,

3342
02:42:20,030 --> 02:42:21,210
52.
That's where Joe Rogan's number and then

3343
02:42:21,211 --> 02:42:26,211
some guy comes that day and it picks up 
all the envelopes and it goes right to 

3344
02:42:26,211 --> 02:42:26,211
instant either and that's the end of the
day.

3345
02:42:26,211 --> 02:42:28,060
When we first got here,
we started maps.

3346
02:42:30,370 --> 02:42:32,460
That turned out to be a Spanish 
prostitution ring.

3347
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:37,520
Wasn't really fucked.
They will fucking those little Mexican 

3348
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:40,431
kids up there as they jumped the wall,
the stretch the muffler out white Duke 

3349
02:42:40,431 --> 02:42:42,400
and fucking Hollywood boulevard.
I got to pee.

3350
02:42:42,640 --> 02:42:47,270
I'm trying to hold the center.
You didn't know that.

3351
02:42:47,810 --> 02:42:52,810
I know that.
That star maps even made a movie about 

3352
02:42:53,831 --> 02:42:58,831
it.
What tall star maps really went out 

3353
02:42:58,831 --> 02:43:00,390
there with the title?
What's the weight?

3354
02:43:00,450 --> 02:43:02,290
They made a movie about it.
Yeah,

3355
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:08,840
and this was what you could a bro.
Look at the tagline down there.

3356
02:43:09,211 --> 02:43:12,190
If you can read it time.
Carlos wants

3357
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:14,800
to be an actor,
but his father,

3358
02:43:14,970 --> 02:43:17,170
pepper one sent me to work in the family
business.

3359
02:43:17,171 --> 02:43:22,171
That is male prostitution.
Carlos decides that he will be one of 

3360
02:43:22,841 --> 02:43:25,510
his fathers boys until he can.
What in the fuck,

3361
02:43:25,511 --> 02:43:26,610
man?
Star maps.

3362
02:43:27,310 --> 02:43:29,440
I had no idea.
Nineteen 97.

3363
02:43:29,470 --> 02:43:30,880
That's great.
That's so nuts.

3364
02:43:31,870 --> 02:43:34,690
No idea.
And that's for people that don't know,

3365
02:43:34,700 --> 02:43:37,510
that's the people that they sold map to 
celebrity homes.

3366
02:43:37,511 --> 02:43:39,820
Right.
That was the whole idea of a sunset when

3367
02:43:39,821 --> 02:43:41,500
you,
when I first got here in [inaudible] 98,

3368
02:43:42,100 --> 02:43:44,200
that was a thousand of those moocs on 
sunset.

3369
02:43:44,980 --> 02:43:48,430
Fucking uh,
uh,

3370
02:43:48,580 --> 02:43:49,940
you know.
Yeah.

3371
02:43:50,200 --> 02:43:52,760
Yeah.
And Hollywood and uh,

3372
02:43:53,490 --> 02:43:55,390
they're still out there.
They still are,

3373
02:43:55,391 --> 02:43:58,030
but just less heroin is involved with 
that.

3374
02:43:58,300 --> 02:43:58,770
Well,
not,

3375
02:43:58,771 --> 02:44:03,771
I don't see the star.
I see the star vans don't see the star 

3376
02:44:03,771 --> 02:44:06,070
maps.
I don't see the so much better.

3377
02:44:07,230 --> 02:44:10,760
I was holding that one crazy man.
Bitch.

3378
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:13,150
Fucking craziness.
It goes fast.

3379
02:44:14,080 --> 02:44:17,370
Great things we're do with our lives.
You know what I'm saying?

3380
02:44:17,650 --> 02:44:19,840
What are you going to do with our lives?
That's the thing.

3381
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:22,180
Where does it all go?
Man?

3382
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:26,650
Thousand podcasts now was exchanged.
Fucking a society.

3383
02:44:28,220 --> 02:44:29,210
You fucking stop.

3384
02:44:30,130 --> 02:44:32,040
Changed.
Changed us for sure.

3385
02:44:33,350 --> 02:44:35,010
It's a tapping.
All the people thing.

3386
02:44:35,011 --> 02:44:40,011
All the people you've had on the 
conversations you've had with those 

3387
02:44:40,011 --> 02:44:40,011
people,
you know,

3388
02:44:40,140 --> 02:44:44,100
how much of that would you ever have if 
it wasn't for doing your podcast?

3389
02:44:44,730 --> 02:44:45,630
No,
it changes you.

3390
02:44:45,631 --> 02:44:48,360
It changes the way you think of things.
It changes me for sure.

3391
02:44:48,780 --> 02:44:53,780
It changed a lot of the way I think if 
things are getting a chance to sit down 

3392
02:44:53,780 --> 02:44:55,200
with people for hours and hours 
uninterrupted,

3393
02:44:55,650 --> 02:44:57,750
no phone calls,
no messages,

3394
02:44:57,751 --> 02:45:02,751
no text messages,
and to be able to do that on a regular 

3395
02:45:02,751 --> 02:45:06,171
basis,
you get to know people and like a way 

3396
02:45:06,171 --> 02:45:08,751
different way.
We don't really get a chance to do that 

3397
02:45:08,751 --> 02:45:10,350
with each other that often to sit down 
and just have no distractions.

3398
02:45:10,770 --> 02:45:13,020
Just you and a friend having a 
conversation,

3399
02:45:13,021 --> 02:45:18,021
laughing,
talking shit about things or the cool 

3400
02:45:18,021 --> 02:45:18,021
thing is that's the experience.

3401
02:45:18,021 --> 02:45:20,820
People are getting listening to it.
That's why you know how much time,

3402
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:25,590
how many times have we been on the road 
and we went to a diner afterwards and we

3403
02:45:25,591 --> 02:45:30,591
were laughing literally until we in 
tears falling down like we were doing 

3404
02:45:30,811 --> 02:45:33,120
podcasts.
It was just nobody listening to lecture.

3405
02:45:33,190 --> 02:45:37,830
Crying and laughing was like the three 
of us and some fucking strange.

3406
02:45:37,831 --> 02:45:39,340
Nashville,
it's.

3407
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:41,370
I understand.
Totally is what happened today.

3408
02:45:41,490 --> 02:45:44,940
It's the same thing.
Exactly.

3409
02:45:45,030 --> 02:45:46,770
Exactly.
Exactly.

3410
02:45:46,890 --> 02:45:51,890
No,
it's so cool to replicate it left in 

3411
02:45:51,890 --> 02:45:51,890
that joint over there.
Yeah,

3412
02:45:51,890 --> 02:45:54,750
that's definitely more for open those 
reefer madness.

3413
02:45:54,770 --> 02:45:59,770
I brought another shout out to la speed.
We'd Gina.

3414
02:46:00,380 --> 02:46:05,380
Gina was keeping us keeping it strong.
I don't know what they got to do though.

3415
02:46:06,870 --> 02:46:08,640
They got to be careful with these 
fucking things.

3416
02:46:08,641 --> 02:46:09,590
They give these

3417
02:46:10,190 --> 02:46:15,190
suspended at an actual glass thing that 
the weed comes in and breaks in your 

3418
02:46:15,190 --> 02:46:15,990
pocket.
Oh,

3419
02:46:15,991 --> 02:46:17,320
that's no good.
That's not good.

3420
02:46:17,570 --> 02:46:22,570
This one is superior slick.
When you go to a bathroom at a hotel 

3421
02:46:22,570 --> 02:46:23,760
like a fine.
So they give you glasses in there.

3422
02:46:23,780 --> 02:46:27,140
There's two glasses by the sink.
Like what the fuck?

3423
02:46:28,160 --> 02:46:29,730
Those pretentious we'd guys.
Yeah.

3424
02:46:29,870 --> 02:46:32,300
Oh Man.
Well it's clearly an indycar.

3425
02:46:32,630 --> 02:46:37,310
Probably the south Americans trained 
like a micro dose.

3426
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:41,090
The other side.
It might be BC in my PBC.

3427
02:46:42,430 --> 02:46:43,030
Yeah,
sorry.

3428
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:44,240
I'm pretty sure.
Pretty sure.

3429
02:46:44,241 --> 02:46:45,890
It's like maybe,
maybe Seattle,

3430
02:46:46,040 --> 02:46:48,380
maybe Seattle.
Northwest,

3431
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:50,870
northwest.
It's like basically the good stuff.

3432
02:46:51,470 --> 02:46:55,250
Joe.
We motherfucking Dee Wade adrenaline.

3433
02:46:55,580 --> 02:46:58,490
Wow.
Podcast.

3434
02:46:59,150 --> 02:47:00,260
I forgot there's a show tonight.

3435
02:47:04,170 --> 02:47:06,700
We're going to forget a lot of shit 
along the way too.

3436
02:47:07,580 --> 02:47:10,970
I feel like it's St and pma.
We talked about some shit earlier.

3437
02:47:10,971 --> 02:47:12,560
That was the funniest shit ever said in 
my life,

3438
02:47:12,710 --> 02:47:14,870
but if anybody asks me like,
how is the podcast that I go,

3439
02:47:14,930 --> 02:47:17,300
oh dude,
Joey Diaz went on a rant.

3440
02:47:17,330 --> 02:47:20,510
It was the funniest fucking thing I ever
heard in my life.

3441
02:47:20,850 --> 02:47:22,050
Then he'd go,
what is it about ago?

3442
02:47:22,880 --> 02:47:24,770
Couldn't tell,
couldn't tell.

3443
02:47:26,690 --> 02:47:30,180
I also couldn't tell you what the last 
thing we talked about this or that.

3444
02:47:30,680 --> 02:47:32,060
Whatever it is.
I don't know what it is.

3445
02:47:32,420 --> 02:47:35,060
It's not that important.
It's not that important,

3446
02:47:35,560 --> 02:47:36,950
but these things change us,
man.

3447
02:47:36,951 --> 02:47:38,360
I know your,
your podcast,

3448
02:47:38,390 --> 02:47:39,790
changing new job,
you know,

3449
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:44,800
it's,
it's connecting you with a most people 

3450
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:47,681
that like to come out,
see you in a way that nothing else has 

3451
02:47:47,681 --> 02:47:47,681
ever had before,
you know?

3452
02:47:47,681 --> 02:47:51,180
No.
The biggest thing about the podcast is 

3453
02:47:51,180 --> 02:47:51,180
keeps me in check,
keeps Punjab substance check.

3454
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:53,480
We got to stick to what we say.
Yeah.

3455
02:47:54,020 --> 02:47:55,860
We got to preach what we talk about,
you know,

3456
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:57,010
acute system check,
man.

3457
02:47:57,770 --> 02:47:58,800
There's no more.
Uh,

3458
02:47:58,820 --> 02:48:01,930
we got somebody watching this now that 
you know,

3459
02:48:02,180 --> 02:48:03,950
so it's pretty fun.
And interesting to me,

3460
02:48:04,400 --> 02:48:05,900
it does keep in check,
but it also,

3461
02:48:05,901 --> 02:48:06,400
it's,
it's,

3462
02:48:06,410 --> 02:48:08,750
um,
ultimately satisfying to,

3463
02:48:08,751 --> 02:48:10,790
you know,
to just stay in check,

3464
02:48:10,830 --> 02:48:15,830
you know,
to like think about what you're doing 

3465
02:48:15,830 --> 02:48:15,830
and say,
say,

3466
02:48:15,830 --> 02:48:16,770
say things that are as accurate as you 
possibly know,

3467
02:48:16,780 --> 02:48:18,370
be honest about how,
you know,

3468
02:48:18,710 --> 02:48:23,710
how you're thinking about these things.
Like where are you drawing your 

3469
02:48:23,710 --> 02:48:23,710
conclusions from?
Totally.

3470
02:48:23,710 --> 02:48:24,080
People don't have a chance to do that 
that often.

3471
02:48:24,081 --> 02:48:26,120
They don't have to be accountable for 
their own thoughts,

3472
02:48:26,920 --> 02:48:27,590
you know,
not,

3473
02:48:27,591 --> 02:48:30,920
not to the level of like someone who,
uh,

3474
02:48:31,160 --> 02:48:36,160
is a hosting a podcast or someone who's 
constantly being reviewed by people you 

3475
02:48:36,921 --> 02:48:41,921
know,
like people do hold you accountable to 

3476
02:48:41,921 --> 02:48:41,921
do.

3477
02:48:41,921 --> 02:48:41,921
They do.
And that's what I like about it.

3478
02:48:41,921 --> 02:48:46,510
They showed if I get to do a periscope 
in the morning and I tell people I'm 

3479
02:48:46,510 --> 02:48:46,510
gonna,
go to Jujitsu today,

3480
02:48:46,510 --> 02:48:48,460
I get 20 tweets.
Sedna was it?

3481
02:48:48,500 --> 02:48:51,350
What did you learn that I didn't go 
because Ah,

3482
02:48:51,351 --> 02:48:56,150
you fucking pussy to you guys.
Listen Bro.

3483
02:48:56,151 --> 02:48:58,910
Let me tell you some good back told.
My mother stopped drinking.

3484
02:48:59,450 --> 02:49:01,910
She stopped drinking in 11 days later.
She was dead.

3485
02:49:02,480 --> 02:49:04,860
That's why I believe you always got to 
have a shot at something.

3486
02:49:04,880 --> 02:49:09,880
You know what I'm saying?
I'm not talking about drinking a bottle 

3487
02:49:09,880 --> 02:49:12,921
at night.
I'm not a big believer in anecdotal 

3488
02:49:12,921 --> 02:49:15,741
evidence unless it benefits me.
So in that case I'll go with one to two 

3489
02:49:15,741 --> 02:49:16,830
notes.
Ain't going to kill nobody.

3490
02:49:17,220 --> 02:49:20,660
You were saying Dr.
say do this circle.

3491
02:49:20,710 --> 02:49:25,710
Let me.
I was so much fun to you.

3492
02:49:27,250 --> 02:49:27,790
James.
James.

3493
02:49:28,090 --> 02:49:30,660
Motherfucker.
You good sir?

3494
02:49:34,230 --> 02:49:36,160
When you drink these things.
Like I said,

3495
02:49:36,180 --> 02:49:39,000
it's nothing.
I love the white dudes.

3496
02:49:39,630 --> 02:49:42,000
I love white people.
Do you like.

3497
02:49:42,001 --> 02:49:45,720
I don't like these like nice white 
people they dragged me with.

3498
02:49:45,740 --> 02:49:47,850
But what about Charlottesville?
Kinda crazy white people.

3499
02:49:47,851 --> 02:49:52,851
But like where do you draw the line?
I like white people who bring a bottle 

3500
02:49:52,851 --> 02:49:56,061
of Bourbon,
but the most important thing is they 

3501
02:49:56,061 --> 02:49:56,310
bring a bag of ice because then when you
fucking with that ice,

3502
02:49:57,240 --> 02:49:59,180
when a white dude shows up with a bad 
guys,

3503
02:49:59,220 --> 02:50:04,220
that's a man of class stylists.
Don't put it in the freezer and leave it

3504
02:50:05,971 --> 02:50:10,971
right there.
That means they dropped one ice cube in 

3505
02:50:10,971 --> 02:50:10,971
there every 20 minutes and they got a 
time.

3506
02:50:10,971 --> 02:50:13,640
That's the whole thing.
Just fuck fucking ice.

3507
02:50:13,730 --> 02:50:15,270
Yeah,
I totally agree.

3508
02:50:15,350 --> 02:50:17,170
Man.
Dude's house and he's gonna.

3509
02:50:17,190 --> 02:50:19,140
Walk in human door.
Filled with cigars.

3510
02:50:19,170 --> 02:50:20,850
Do you go,
Huh?

3511
02:50:21,690 --> 02:50:22,920
Yeah.
Malone the fuck.

3512
02:50:22,921 --> 02:50:24,480
Are you doing man?
What are you doing with your time?

3513
02:50:24,830 --> 02:50:29,830
You got a walking human door.
I feel like age is matches up with 

3514
02:50:29,830 --> 02:50:34,071
cigars in a way that few things do.
Like an old dude with a cigar is like,

3515
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:37,200
I want to hang out with him.
I wouldn't have a drink.

3516
02:50:37,470 --> 02:50:39,170
I want to hear what he has to say.
Yeah.

3517
02:50:39,180 --> 02:50:40,950
Like a 22 year old with cigar.
I'm like,

3518
02:50:40,951 --> 02:50:45,951
get the fuck Outta here.
You feel like you can't have a leather 

3519
02:50:46,321 --> 02:50:48,690
vest and you're like,
fuck tee shirt with a leather vest.

3520
02:50:49,370 --> 02:50:51,210
You don't smoke smoking.
You don't look cool.

3521
02:50:51,211 --> 02:50:52,680
Smoking the cigar.
Tony Soprano.

3522
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:55,790
Go turn it over.
You're like,

3523
02:50:55,791 --> 02:50:57,750
I need to fucking cigar.
You know why?

3524
02:50:57,751 --> 02:51:00,650
I Bet James Gandolfini really enjoyed 
smoking a cigar.

3525
02:51:01,030 --> 02:51:05,180
He's like actually enjoying the cigar 
while he's acting like he's enjoying.

3526
02:51:05,490 --> 02:51:07,320
Enjoys the it.
He was a bad motherfucker.

3527
02:51:09,450 --> 02:51:11,100
Hell,
you want me to tell you something?

3528
02:51:11,101 --> 02:51:13,700
That's the first guy I could say like 
doing.

3529
02:51:13,720 --> 02:51:15,720
A couple of weeks ago,
I went back to my hotel room,

3530
02:51:17,260 --> 02:51:21,180
the fucking original getaway with Steve 
McQueen and I forgot,

3531
02:51:21,181 --> 02:51:22,240
Bro.
I felt,

3532
02:51:22,250 --> 02:51:23,880
God,
you forget your roller.

3533
02:51:24,570 --> 02:51:25,980
Look,
I get tears in my eyes.

3534
02:51:26,250 --> 02:51:30,240
He's in the dumpster with that bitch.
After the thing,

3535
02:51:30,241 --> 02:51:33,150
tripped them over and she's fucking town
them on.

3536
02:51:33,480 --> 02:51:34,080
He's like,
well,

3537
02:51:34,081 --> 02:51:35,730
we should just break waves.
And she's like,

3538
02:51:35,731 --> 02:51:40,731
well obviously you can't get over me 
having sex with somebody else or you're 

3539
02:51:40,731 --> 02:51:42,060
a mental midget.
And Steve Mcqueen,

3540
02:51:42,061 --> 02:51:47,061
Bro.
He just grabbed me by the hand and then 

3541
02:51:47,061 --> 02:51:47,460
he goes back to the whole.
He shoots all those fucking rednecks.

3542
02:51:48,460 --> 02:51:50,820
Oh,
we forget how bad.

3543
02:51:50,821 --> 02:51:51,900
Steve McQueen.
We'll look at him.

3544
02:51:52,290 --> 02:51:57,290
Look at this fucking look at this 
fucking man of a man that he was my man 

3545
02:51:58,350 --> 02:52:00,210
so lot.
So from the Godfather.

3546
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:03,870
Watch Steve McQueen with a fucking suit 
on.

3547
02:52:04,110 --> 02:52:06,220
This is 1973 dog.

3548
02:52:09,400 --> 02:52:14,400
He's so smooth.
This is not the scene you got to put on 

3549
02:52:14,400 --> 02:52:17,970
the scene is when he beats up.
Allie mcgraw and she thought it was 

3550
02:52:17,970 --> 02:52:21,241
acting and he just lived.
He pretty much smack the shit outta her.

3551
02:52:21,401 --> 02:52:24,520
She didn't know,
but he would smack the shit out of every

3552
02:52:24,520 --> 02:52:28,120
other day for some reason or another.
He was like her up.

3553
02:52:28,570 --> 02:52:30,030
Yeah.
Seen Bro.

3554
02:52:30,040 --> 02:52:33,340
He just had funny,
funny thing.

3555
02:52:33,450 --> 02:52:38,450
I'll probably wear it with your listing.
I don't believe in violence towards 

3556
02:52:38,450 --> 02:52:39,850
women,
but if I wasn't married to Yoko Ono,

3557
02:52:39,851 --> 02:52:43,890
you know you gotta kick her once a day,
somewhere in the back and the stomach.

3558
02:52:44,380 --> 02:52:49,380
Shut the fuck up sheet.
Look how beautiful this woman was.

3559
02:52:49,870 --> 02:52:54,870
Number one,
look at the natural beauty of this 

3560
02:52:54,870 --> 02:52:55,870
fucking woman and look at this blonde 
savage of a man.

3561
02:52:55,871 --> 02:52:58,840
Look at him.
He's fucking.

3562
02:52:59,080 --> 02:53:03,070
Steve McQueen gets out of the car and he
just starts walking in front of the car.

3563
02:53:03,700 --> 02:53:05,880
Does he smack her after this?
He was little.

3564
02:53:06,210 --> 02:53:11,210
He had beautiful look at him with his 
black suit on and he's furious.

3565
02:53:12,560 --> 02:53:14,200
Fight hair.
I wear my hair like that.

3566
02:53:14,230 --> 02:53:16,560
Yes.
I will make my head start.

3567
02:53:16,570 --> 02:53:17,930
Okay.
Crazy glue.

3568
02:53:19,480 --> 02:53:24,480
I figured out,
but you don't want to lose you and put 

3569
02:53:24,480 --> 02:53:24,690
crazy glue in the morning.
They won't go nowhere.

3570
02:53:25,050 --> 02:53:27,090
Now she's getting out of the car.
She looks upset.

3571
02:53:28,030 --> 02:53:29,510
It was pretty emotional.
Yeah.

3572
02:53:29,750 --> 02:53:31,790
Look at this year,
this 72.

3573
02:53:31,791 --> 02:53:34,130
I was not and I went to see this the 
first weekend.

3574
02:53:34,670 --> 02:53:36,140
My mother goes,
what'd you go see?

3575
02:53:36,500 --> 02:53:38,900
Steve McQueen.
Are you fucking crazy?

3576
02:53:39,740 --> 02:53:42,290
Wow.
Oh Jesus Christ.

3577
02:53:46,460 --> 02:53:48,230
Okay.

3578
02:53:48,620 --> 02:53:49,970
Oh Dude.
He's hitting there for real.

3579
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:51,290
She didn't know she was going to get 
hit.

3580
02:53:51,380 --> 02:53:56,380
She didn't know.
Oh my God.

3581
02:53:59,510 --> 02:54:00,440
Fuck man.

3582
02:54:20,850 --> 02:54:21,570
Jesus,
man.

3583
02:54:21,980 --> 02:54:23,290
You.
When was the last time you saw this?

3584
02:54:23,300 --> 02:54:26,240
You got to see this shit and if you 
really want to see a beaten,

3585
02:54:26,520 --> 02:54:28,730
you got pull out on the longest year.
I will.

3586
02:54:28,750 --> 02:54:33,750
Burt rentals in the beginning when he 
grabs her by the throat and hits her 

3587
02:54:33,750 --> 02:54:35,490
with a bottle of something.
This Berg Grant,

3588
02:54:35,780 --> 02:54:37,080
we watched it here,
but this,

3589
02:54:37,081 --> 02:54:39,360
this is fucked up because it's crazy 
that you,

3590
02:54:39,410 --> 02:54:43,560
you know,
he's really hitting her a few times.

3591
02:54:44,040 --> 02:54:49,040
He told her.
It's like when Sean Penn did at close 

3592
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:53,091
range with with whatever and he kept 
shooting a gun and finally Sean Pengos 

3593
02:54:53,091 --> 02:54:54,510
Gimme the gun because you're not 
reacting to the right way.

3594
02:54:55,260 --> 02:55:00,260
You're not being scared.
So he shot a real gun at Christopher 

3595
02:55:00,260 --> 02:55:00,420
Walken,
Christopher Walken,

3596
02:55:00,421 --> 02:55:03,240
and talks about it all the time.
Look at this fucking savage.

3597
02:55:05,520 --> 02:55:10,520
Go knows the movie.
Opens this shit.

3598
02:55:11,370 --> 02:55:16,170
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.

3599
02:55:16,171 --> 02:55:18,630
It's amazing.
With 40 years has done.

3600
02:55:19,320 --> 02:55:20,390
Yeah.
People use a bb.

3601
02:55:20,740 --> 02:55:23,700
How beautiful.
She never seen anything like this

3602
02:55:25,070 --> 02:55:25,760
sledding.

3603
02:55:26,630 --> 02:55:27,830
Oh,
splitting man.

3604
02:55:28,130 --> 02:55:32,600
Look at his body because this guy was 
not juicing this guy fucking nuts.

3605
02:55:33,480 --> 02:55:38,480
You all American son of a bitch.
This is like a soap opera from Mexico.

3606
02:55:44,280 --> 02:55:47,000
This is fucking soap opera from Mexico,
Bro.

3607
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:52,540
Totally is.
Totally is.

3608
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:57,950
So in the seventies,
everybody had Busan that on TV.

3609
02:55:58,020 --> 02:56:01,960
Everybody's,
everybody's house had booze me.

3610
02:56:02,100 --> 02:56:05,820
So Burt Reynolds got it.
Yeah.

3611
02:56:05,980 --> 02:56:06,600
Day.
Yeah.

3612
02:56:10,660 --> 02:56:13,370
Well,
well,

3613
02:56:21,360 --> 02:56:21,980
wow.

3614
02:56:26,600 --> 02:56:30,110
So hostile.
Oh my God.

3615
02:56:30,111 --> 02:56:35,111
She bit him.
Oh,

3616
02:56:39,990 --> 02:56:44,990
she threw some shit out of him.
This is a Mexican soap opera side.

3617
02:56:49,520 --> 02:56:50,420
Jesus man.

3618
02:56:52,850 --> 02:56:53,660
Oh,

3619
02:56:55,320 --> 02:56:59,170
a fake slapped the guy that was a real 
throat.

3620
02:56:59,510 --> 02:57:01,860
We'll throw that,
throw the ground seems super real.

3621
02:57:01,861 --> 02:57:04,080
That would hurt your hip.
That's a hard floor.

3622
02:57:04,200 --> 02:57:06,270
Didn't even give her a cushion man.
Like,

3623
02:57:06,271 --> 02:57:07,220
look at what's going on.
Yeah.

3624
02:57:07,350 --> 02:57:11,340
There was an actress.
Would you let burt reynolds throw you to

3625
02:57:11,341 --> 02:57:12,030
the ground?
No.

3626
02:57:12,031 --> 02:57:13,160
Fuck No.
No.

3627
02:57:13,170 --> 02:57:16,770
That year dude.
Getting thrown to the hurts that she had

3628
02:57:16,771 --> 02:57:19,530
hurts.
Like she just ricocheted off the ground.

3629
02:57:19,531 --> 02:57:23,510
One hundred percent.
That wasn't a stockperson often.

3630
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:28,270
This stuff.
Weird question now dog gets into is cost

3631
02:57:28,320 --> 02:57:30,330
super weird.
He's got up Joe Rogan.

3632
02:57:30,960 --> 02:57:32,130
Joe Rogan.
You ready for this?

3633
02:57:32,610 --> 02:57:37,610
He gets in his fucking whatever.
He starts it up and all of a sudden you 

3634
02:57:37,801 --> 02:57:41,190
hear Saturday night,
fucking let it scan it.

3635
02:57:41,410 --> 02:57:42,580
Dad.
Uh,

3636
02:57:44,210 --> 02:57:45,500
he showed me.
That's all right ma'am.

3637
02:57:45,630 --> 02:57:48,000
Did Austin play that part?
Oh my gosh.

3638
02:57:48,390 --> 02:57:49,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

3639
02:57:49,800 --> 02:57:54,800
As soon as that,
he gets in his class and that's what's 

3640
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:55,360
on the right.
Here we go.

3641
02:57:55,480 --> 02:58:00,480
A Burt Reynolds v eight.
Oh yeah,

3642
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:07,100
yeah.
Black box.

3643
02:58:09,770 --> 02:58:12,090
That's a Maserati.
Levante.

3644
02:58:12,360 --> 02:58:13,040
It's.
Oh,

3645
02:58:13,050 --> 02:58:15,300
that's hilarious.
Wo The cops.

3646
02:58:15,900 --> 02:58:20,900
She called the cops.
Whoa.

3647
02:58:27,250 --> 02:58:30,930
That car is so fast.
Oh my God.

3648
02:58:33,350 --> 02:58:37,370
Meanwhile,
that car handles like total dog shit.

3649
02:58:39,020 --> 02:58:41,090
What is it?
I don't know,

3650
02:58:41,091 --> 02:58:44,870
but I mean those cars back then.
Even the best ones handled like shit.

3651
02:58:45,860 --> 02:58:50,810
That thing as skinny tires.
A fucking caveman suspension.

3652
02:58:53,710 --> 02:58:58,710
Well,
it probably did drive a lot better than 

3653
02:58:58,710 --> 02:58:58,990
those police cars.
Police cars were like the worst cars you

3654
02:58:58,991 --> 02:59:00,760
could drive.
Your trying to catch somebody.

3655
02:59:01,290 --> 02:59:03,640
They have four doors.
You want a car that has two doors.

3656
02:59:04,700 --> 02:59:06,760
That's true.
Sports car.

3657
02:59:06,761 --> 02:59:11,761
It's got a good balance and something go
wrong corners quick with you don't like 

3658
02:59:11,761 --> 02:59:11,890
race.
Cars aren't big long.

3659
02:59:11,891 --> 02:59:14,710
Four doors.
That's a lot of extra weight.

3660
02:59:16,960 --> 02:59:18,600
It's nuts.
Yeah.

3661
02:59:18,601 --> 02:59:22,750
Having a like a police car,
but today they have police cars today.

3662
02:59:22,890 --> 02:59:24,730
They're like,
they can make like mustangs.

3663
02:59:24,731 --> 02:59:26,980
They turn them into a police car 
charger.

3664
02:59:26,981 --> 02:59:28,180
Yeah.
Dude,

3665
02:59:29,250 --> 02:59:33,100
there's some scary cars today when it 
comes to like a a car pulling you over.

3666
02:59:33,250 --> 02:59:35,740
Like if the cops have that new dodge 
demon.

3667
02:59:35,980 --> 02:59:38,770
Have you seen that thing that's fucking 
nuts.

3668
02:59:38,771 --> 02:59:42,100
800 horsepower.
Zero to 60 in like two seconds.

3669
02:59:42,400 --> 02:59:43,600
Really fucking crazy.

3670
02:59:45,690 --> 02:59:49,180
Like they can love it.
They make sure it doesn't work.

3671
02:59:49,181 --> 02:59:53,830
If it's colder than 15 degrees out Dubai
has the world's fastest police car,

3672
02:59:54,210 --> 02:59:55,740
have a Bugatti.
Oh my God.

3673
02:59:55,910 --> 03:00:00,040
Two Pie ball in the fall and so strong,
so strong.

3674
03:00:00,400 --> 03:00:03,370
I mean if you disrespect bond,
you forget about cultural differences.

3675
03:00:03,371 --> 03:00:04,690
You got to respect their ball.
Oh,

3676
03:00:04,720 --> 03:00:07,960
divide does it up if you.
If you do it up even a little bit.

3677
03:00:07,961 --> 03:00:09,010
I don't give a fuck.
Stop.

3678
03:00:09,040 --> 03:00:11,880
Stop making excuses.
They ball harder than anybody.

3679
03:00:11,881 --> 03:00:16,881
Yeah.
They have an indoor ski place that you 

3680
03:00:16,881 --> 03:00:16,881
could have in the desert.
Did He.

3681
03:00:16,881 --> 03:00:18,040
Was there a fight there?
No,

3682
03:00:18,220 --> 03:00:21,640
but there was a fight in Abu Dhabi and 
we did the weigh ins and Dubai.

3683
03:00:21,850 --> 03:00:23,470
That's cool.
It was weird,

3684
03:00:23,471 --> 03:00:28,471
man.
There's so much money there that was 

3685
03:00:28,471 --> 03:00:28,471
interested in against Damien Maia.
Yeah.

3686
03:00:28,471 --> 03:00:30,640
And Frankie Edgar versus Bj Penn to 
like,

3687
03:00:30,660 --> 03:00:32,740
I'm pretty sure that we're there to 
really have crazy,

3688
03:00:32,741 --> 03:00:35,860
crazy money.
I think it's off the charts,

3689
03:00:35,920 --> 03:00:36,760
you know,
I think.

3690
03:00:37,120 --> 03:00:39,220
I don't think we even understand oil 
money.

3691
03:00:39,460 --> 03:00:41,590
You know,
what we make.

3692
03:00:41,650 --> 03:00:46,650
We think we're doing good these guys,
and it's like many generations of having

3693
03:00:47,201 --> 03:00:50,440
that kind of cash.
It's a different level of cash now.

3694
03:00:51,310 --> 03:00:55,000
The family wealth,
it gets passed down.

3695
03:00:55,060 --> 03:01:00,060
That's where the news is.
Old white money ain't no ganglion that

3696
03:01:00,230 --> 03:01:03,340
Jack.
They have interior a surf places too.

3697
03:01:03,780 --> 03:01:05,650
We can go surfing.
It's nuts man.

3698
03:01:05,680 --> 03:01:10,680
You run a surf board and is that where 
the government will give citizens money 

3699
03:01:10,680 --> 03:01:11,830
that just want to do anything?
Really?

3700
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:12,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

3701
03:01:12,430 --> 03:01:15,220
My Dubai,
I thought so maybe I have it wrong,

3702
03:01:15,221 --> 03:01:18,550
but my cousin came here to study English
like from Peru,

3703
03:01:18,700 --> 03:01:22,000
so he had a class with a bunch of people
from different countries.

3704
03:01:22,420 --> 03:01:25,150
I thought he said this classmate from 
Dubai will be like,

3705
03:01:25,360 --> 03:01:29,500
everybody want to go out on Saturday,
like it's all good and would pick people

3706
03:01:29,501 --> 03:01:33,790
up and like limo buses and he's like 
wait,

3707
03:01:33,791 --> 03:01:34,930
who's paying for this?
And he's like,

3708
03:01:34,931 --> 03:01:36,040
oh I got it.
It ain't shit.

3709
03:01:37,390 --> 03:01:39,940
And then was telling them like,
he was like,

3710
03:01:39,941 --> 03:01:41,440
how we you're just going to pave this?
He's like,

3711
03:01:41,640 --> 03:01:42,890
look,
it's just given to me man.

3712
03:01:43,120 --> 03:01:44,170
I got to spend all this shit.

3713
03:01:44,200 --> 03:01:45,630
I don't even know what the disease is 
current.

3714
03:01:45,720 --> 03:01:49,180
Just buying everybody drinks,
food,

3715
03:01:49,930 --> 03:01:52,810
going to vegas like 15 people.
He just in class with.

3716
03:01:53,400 --> 03:01:54,910
Yeah.
Nobody balls harder than them.

3717
03:01:55,150 --> 03:01:56,830
Yeah.
It's pretty out of control everywhere he

3718
03:01:56,831 --> 03:01:57,850
goes.
Ferrari's,

3719
03:01:58,480 --> 03:01:59,950
bentleys,
lamborghinis.

3720
03:02:00,340 --> 03:02:05,340
There's like ridiculous.
There's cars that I feel like it would 

3721
03:02:05,340 --> 03:02:07,711
be ridiculous to show up on one of those
boundaries that they have or one of 

3722
03:02:07,711 --> 03:02:08,800
those bugattis rather that they have as 
a police car for sure.

3723
03:02:08,890 --> 03:02:12,070
Since sandy now like two and a half 
million bucks so much.

3724
03:02:12,610 --> 03:02:14,350
I think floyd mayweather has like six.

3725
03:02:17,070 --> 03:02:20,170
He's hilarious.
His habits are hilarious.

3726
03:02:20,171 --> 03:02:23,050
I love him.
He's got like a whole list in white.

3727
03:02:23,380 --> 03:02:26,680
White is right.
I got a bunch of two though.

3728
03:02:26,681 --> 03:02:28,480
Man.
Does gang or cars?

3729
03:02:28,710 --> 03:02:32,550
All the money to the irs.
Why don't you just give him.

3730
03:02:33,370 --> 03:02:36,350
Because he went so deep so much.
Does he?

3731
03:02:36,351 --> 03:02:37,510
Oh,
well.

3732
03:02:37,590 --> 03:02:40,000
Uh,
it's more than you want to pay.

3733
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:43,270
It's in the 20 plus million dollar 
range.

3734
03:02:43,300 --> 03:02:44,140
It's a lot of money,
man.

3735
03:02:44,560 --> 03:02:48,520
But it's not something that he's been a.
it's not like deception.

3736
03:02:49,230 --> 03:02:54,230
No.
It's just neglect to neglect and it's 

3737
03:02:54,230 --> 03:02:54,340
also like,
I think there is truth to this.

3738
03:02:54,400 --> 03:02:59,400
He makes so much money,
there's probably a point where they're 

3739
03:02:59,400 --> 03:02:59,400
like,
hey,

3740
03:02:59,400 --> 03:03:00,160
it's time to pay your taxes.
And you go like,

3741
03:03:00,580 --> 03:03:03,730
all right,
here's a check for $25 million dollars.

3742
03:03:03,850 --> 03:03:06,280
That's an incredible amount of money.
And then they go,

3743
03:03:06,281 --> 03:03:07,960
that's true,
but you owe 50 more.

3744
03:03:08,470 --> 03:03:10,170
And he's just like,
that's,

3745
03:03:10,360 --> 03:03:13,990
that can't be right.
I've got $25,000,000.

3746
03:03:14,460 --> 03:03:19,460
Yeah.
Like what are you talking about when 

3747
03:03:19,460 --> 03:03:21,360
he's bought over 100 luxury cars from 
the same dealer and always pays in cash 

3748
03:03:21,800 --> 03:03:24,570
is $15 million worth of cars.
Congratulated.

3749
03:03:24,580 --> 03:03:26,260
She doesn't drive.
I like it.

3750
03:03:26,380 --> 03:03:27,460
Good.
You can sell those.

3751
03:03:27,461 --> 03:03:29,620
They're worth a lot of money.
He can get that money to,

3752
03:03:30,130 --> 03:03:31,630
you know,
it's um,

3753
03:03:31,740 --> 03:03:33,340
it's just,
it's,

3754
03:03:33,370 --> 03:03:37,240
it's really interesting in the amount of
money that he's able to generate,

3755
03:03:37,590 --> 03:03:42,590
you know,
he's figured out some pretty incredible 

3756
03:03:42,590 --> 03:03:42,590
shit.
He's a great villain to man.

3757
03:03:42,590 --> 03:03:46,860
He's just brilliant at it.
Mean was just a brilliant defensive 

3758
03:03:46,860 --> 03:03:46,860
boxer.
Oh,

3759
03:03:46,860 --> 03:03:48,770
skill wise.
Off the charts off the truck.

3760
03:03:48,771 --> 03:03:53,771
I'm saying that guy should get more 
credit for what he does as a skilled 

3761
03:03:55,570 --> 03:03:57,800
businessman and psychological

3762
03:03:58,460 --> 03:04:00,500
warrior.
Like he should get a lot more credit for

3763
03:04:00,501 --> 03:04:00,890
it.
Yeah,

3764
03:04:00,891 --> 03:04:03,800
I think so too.
I think it's arguable that,

3765
03:04:03,830 --> 03:04:08,830
you know,
he's enjoying it and he enjoys playing 

3766
03:04:08,830 --> 03:04:11,021
the villain role and enjoys like 
flashing on the money and if he is 

3767
03:04:11,021 --> 03:04:13,721
really enjoying it,
like don't you love that and respect 

3768
03:04:13,721 --> 03:04:13,721
that.
That fucking thing.

3769
03:04:13,721 --> 03:04:14,660
What is that car?
That thing looks amazing.

3770
03:04:17,060 --> 03:04:19,770
What is it a CCS?
Is that a con of Sig?

3771
03:04:19,830 --> 03:04:21,980
Yeah,
I'd say that cone.

3772
03:04:22,250 --> 03:04:23,870
That's a word that I've never said a 
name,

3773
03:04:23,871 --> 03:04:28,871
but I can't say it.
I love too that he starts his post with 

3774
03:04:29,451 --> 03:04:32,600
the amount.
Like to remind people that my new car.

3775
03:04:32,660 --> 03:04:34,280
Yeah,
my new four point $8,000,000

3776
03:04:34,281 --> 03:04:37,220
car.
You say that Koenigsegg,

3777
03:04:37,490 --> 03:04:40,800
Koenigsegg.
Koenigsegg coincide coding,

3778
03:04:41,070 --> 03:04:42,600
coding,
coding,

3779
03:04:43,010 --> 03:04:45,300
coding,
Koenigsegg.

3780
03:04:45,890 --> 03:04:47,680
Jesus Christ.
Koenigsegg.

3781
03:04:47,730 --> 03:04:50,390
Zec.
That's a ridiculous name.

3782
03:04:50,690 --> 03:04:52,550
Change your name,
but the cars dope,

3783
03:04:53,570 --> 03:04:54,590
you're saying?

3784
03:04:55,210 --> 03:04:55,880
I think so,
yeah.

3785
03:04:57,020 --> 03:04:58,090
Oh yeah.
I'm in DC.

3786
03:04:58,130 --> 03:05:01,330
Both of working during this fight.
You were headed already recruit.

3787
03:05:01,490 --> 03:05:04,910
I already booked way in advance.
Now it's my dad's birthday.

3788
03:05:04,911 --> 03:05:07,360
I'm going a big birthday celebration.
You got to try to,

3789
03:05:07,370 --> 03:05:09,860
uh,
avoid finding out what happened and then

3790
03:05:09,861 --> 03:05:10,440
watching.
No,

3791
03:05:10,460 --> 03:05:11,420
it depends,
man.

3792
03:05:11,490 --> 03:05:12,680
It,
I haven't.

3793
03:05:13,370 --> 03:05:18,370
I don't know.
I'm going to gauge also his interest in 

3794
03:05:18,370 --> 03:05:18,370
it.
You know,

3795
03:05:18,370 --> 03:05:21,160
I always try to get home before I find 
out anything or watch it before I find 

3796
03:05:21,351 --> 03:05:23,970
out anything and I always fail to do so 
you'll always,

3797
03:05:23,990 --> 03:05:25,100
I cannot give it,
uh,

3798
03:05:25,110 --> 03:05:29,570
give me any temptation.
I know it's hard to go online.

3799
03:05:29,571 --> 03:05:31,580
Let me check real quick.
Am I worthwhile?

3800
03:05:31,581 --> 03:05:36,581
Well,
what if they tell me it's a five round 

3801
03:05:36,581 --> 03:05:36,581
decision,
you know,

3802
03:05:36,581 --> 03:05:39,640
title fight or this one's gonna be 12 
rounds boxing and know it's going to be 

3803
03:05:39,640 --> 03:05:40,400
an exciting event.

3804
03:05:40,400 --> 03:05:43,760
It's one of those like you'll remember 
like the excitement to tune in.

3805
03:05:43,790 --> 03:05:45,590
So I think we are going to want to watch
it.

3806
03:05:45,740 --> 03:05:47,810
You know,
conor mcgregor is a magic person.

3807
03:05:48,080 --> 03:05:53,080
Yeah.
Like legitimately like to get this many 

3808
03:05:53,080 --> 03:05:56,540
people so hyped up about this fight.
It's not just about his performances,

3809
03:05:57,170 --> 03:06:02,170
his fights.
It's also about like wanting to believe 

3810
03:06:02,170 --> 03:06:02,600
that there's a dude who can pull it all 
off.

3811
03:06:03,100 --> 03:06:04,910
Yeah.
It was like a magic person.

3812
03:06:05,060 --> 03:06:06,800
Do you feel like in the lead up to the 
fight,

3813
03:06:06,801 --> 03:06:09,560
like as we get closer,
your opinion on it has changed at all?

3814
03:06:10,970 --> 03:06:12,830
Oh yeah.
I'm a sucker for a good hype job,

3815
03:06:12,831 --> 03:06:14,360
dude.
That's why I'm a good hype man.

3816
03:06:15,790 --> 03:06:20,790
Yeah.
I'm a sucker for believing all that 

3817
03:06:20,790 --> 03:06:23,441
stupid shit.
I thought Gerry Cooney had a chance 

3818
03:06:23,441 --> 03:06:23,441
against Larry Holmes when I was in high 
school.

3819
03:06:23,441 --> 03:06:25,830
I saw Gerry.
Gerry Cooney knockout Ken Norton and was

3820
03:06:25,831 --> 03:06:27,560
like,
he might have a chance.

3821
03:06:27,870 --> 03:06:29,610
I like,
was it.

3822
03:06:29,990 --> 03:06:34,990
Who was the other white dude that was 
the great white hope that I think for 

3823
03:06:34,990 --> 03:06:36,470
Larry Holmes and 82 and he wouldn't make
eye contact.

3824
03:06:36,650 --> 03:06:37,630
No,
not Chavala.

3825
03:06:37,880 --> 03:06:40,220
June of 82 82.
Oh,

3826
03:06:40,221 --> 03:06:41,730
Gelada.
Galana.

3827
03:06:41,890 --> 03:06:44,510
So you're talking about and you know.
Yeah.

3828
03:06:44,780 --> 03:06:48,170
Know Gerry Cooney is the guy that.
Is that the guy you're thinking of?

3829
03:06:48,590 --> 03:06:50,000
The Guy I was talking about,
the guy that.

3830
03:06:50,150 --> 03:06:50,630
Oh,
okay.

3831
03:06:50,631 --> 03:06:52,350
Yeah.
That's Gerry Cooney.

3832
03:06:52,370 --> 03:06:57,370
Yeah.
That's the guy was talking about some 

3833
03:06:57,370 --> 03:06:57,370
white dude.
Yeah.

3834
03:06:57,370 --> 03:06:57,370
When I was in high school,
I was

3835
03:06:57,370 --> 03:06:58,430
who?
Who's the white dude from Bayonne?

3836
03:06:58,470 --> 03:07:00,800
That fort.
Oh,

3837
03:07:00,810 --> 03:07:03,540
the Bale and bleeder weapon.
Yeah.

3838
03:07:03,541 --> 03:07:08,541
I guess he's the guy that they based the
movie rocky on because they didn't 

3839
03:07:08,541 --> 03:07:11,160
expect him to survive and he kept 
surviving.

3840
03:07:11,190 --> 03:07:14,670
You kept moving forward and Chuck Wepner
was the guy.

3841
03:07:14,671 --> 03:07:19,671
I think that was one of the inspirations
for the movie rocky because that guy 

3842
03:07:19,671 --> 03:07:22,860
just kept plodding forward and Muhammad 
Ali beat the shit out of him,

3843
03:07:22,861 --> 03:07:26,520
but I don't think he stopped them.
Damn.

3844
03:07:26,650 --> 03:07:29,540
Yeah,
look at that crackers face man too.

3845
03:07:29,580 --> 03:07:32,400
He got dropped there.
I get that man.

3846
03:07:32,910 --> 03:07:36,930
Muhammad Ali in his prime was so magic,
man.

3847
03:07:37,410 --> 03:07:42,020
What he could do as far as movement,
his ability to like move in and out,

3848
03:07:42,060 --> 03:07:47,060
slide around.
A lot of people thought he was doomed 

3849
03:07:47,060 --> 03:07:49,770
when he was gonna Fight Sonny Liston,
like there is no fucking way this kid is

3850
03:07:49,771 --> 03:07:51,060
in so much trouble.

3851
03:07:51,420 --> 03:07:54,630
All he could do is like box around and 
move and move fast.

3852
03:07:54,631 --> 03:07:58,110
But Sonny Liston is a murderer,
murderous puncher,

3853
03:07:58,410 --> 03:08:01,560
and he got like,
he beat the fuck out of Floyd Patterson.

3854
03:08:01,860 --> 03:08:03,540
So like the way he would beat those 
guys,

3855
03:08:03,541 --> 03:08:04,410
you'd be like,
oh Jesus,

3856
03:08:04,411 --> 03:08:07,050
nobody can stand in front of him.
Like very rumbled Johnson,

3857
03:08:07,950 --> 03:08:09,810
you know,
maybe even more so in his power.

3858
03:08:09,980 --> 03:08:14,980
Yeah.
It was like pitch that it's not taking 

3859
03:08:14,980 --> 03:08:14,980
place today.
Spot,

3860
03:08:15,230 --> 03:08:16,410
you know,
it sucks.

3861
03:08:16,740 --> 03:08:21,540
It sucks about not living through an era
is you can never fully appreciate it.

3862
03:08:21,600 --> 03:08:26,600
Totally much as you want to know.
Like I already know I've had enough 

3863
03:08:26,600 --> 03:08:27,600
lessons about Ali,
you know,

3864
03:08:27,630 --> 03:08:28,830
but like you're like,
Oh man,

3865
03:08:29,160 --> 03:08:30,630
I really wish I would have lived through
it.

3866
03:08:30,720 --> 03:08:35,720
Like I already see it now.
I became conscious of it now because of 

3867
03:08:35,720 --> 03:08:38,700
basketball because people are always 
always doing this Jordan or Lebron,

3868
03:08:39,210 --> 03:08:44,210
you know,
argument this hypothetical and like you 

3869
03:08:44,210 --> 03:08:46,490
go back and forth,
but like you real is the first time I 

3870
03:08:46,490 --> 03:08:48,771
realized there's people arguing who,
who weren't alive during that Jordan 

3871
03:08:49,201 --> 03:08:49,890
craziness.

3872
03:08:49,890 --> 03:08:50,940
And I'm like,
Oh,

3873
03:08:50,941 --> 03:08:53,190
you don't know what the fuck you're 
talking about right now.

3874
03:08:53,580 --> 03:08:58,470
You have no idea what that was like.
You can pull up any statistic you want.

3875
03:08:58,770 --> 03:08:59,470
You have to,
you don't.

3876
03:08:59,500 --> 03:09:04,500
You don't feel that you didn't watch 
that dude become a fucking savage,

3877
03:09:05,610 --> 03:09:08,320
like a God damn,
you know,

3878
03:09:08,430 --> 03:09:13,430
Spanish conquistador in fucking the NBA 
where you could not believe what a 

3879
03:09:13,430 --> 03:09:14,130
killer.
He was like,

3880
03:09:14,430 --> 03:09:19,430
you've never seen that level of 
competitiveness and how like how that 

3881
03:09:19,430 --> 03:09:21,000
dude could dominate.
We've never seen,

3882
03:09:21,150 --> 03:09:22,440
but there's people I realized they were 
like,

3883
03:09:22,560 --> 03:09:23,730
oh no,
I've seen highlights,

3884
03:09:23,731 --> 03:09:24,230
and I'm like,
no,

3885
03:09:24,240 --> 03:09:27,900
you don't get it.
Like you don't get how dominant he was.

3886
03:09:28,050 --> 03:09:29,400
Jordan,
Jordan,

3887
03:09:30,420 --> 03:09:32,850
Jordan dominant.
It was the craziest thing ever.

3888
03:09:33,030 --> 03:09:38,030
The first time I saw Jordan fly from the
foul line through the air and slam dunk 

3889
03:09:40,561 --> 03:09:42,180
a ball.
I remember thinking,

3890
03:09:42,181 --> 03:09:44,400
how.
How does a person,

3891
03:09:44,640 --> 03:09:46,650
how does a person even do that with our 
body?

3892
03:09:46,890 --> 03:09:47,460
Yeah.
Keith,

3893
03:09:47,520 --> 03:09:52,520
he literally flew through the air and 
slam dunked this ball and I'm not 

3894
03:09:52,520 --> 03:09:54,130
exaggerating where it was.
Basically

3895
03:09:54,130 --> 03:09:56,830
where the foul line was.
He fucking went flying to the.

3896
03:09:56,831 --> 03:10:01,831
An extra step job role.
Bowling favor you put on the top 10 dogs

3897
03:10:01,871 --> 03:10:04,570
by Julia survey.
Just one second.

3898
03:10:04,850 --> 03:10:06,460
Let's do that and then we'll go to 
Jordan.

3899
03:10:06,500 --> 03:10:08,890
We'll break it down because before 
Lebron,

3900
03:10:08,891 --> 03:10:13,891
that was Jordan for Jordan,
there was a guy from long island and 

3901
03:10:13,891 --> 03:10:13,891
Julia.
Sure,

3902
03:10:13,891 --> 03:10:18,570
and he used to kill one team.
The best dunks of all time with done by 

3903
03:10:18,570 --> 03:10:21,250
him against the Lakers.
Here guys.

3904
03:10:21,340 --> 03:10:22,480
This isn't.
This isn't.

3905
03:10:22,780 --> 03:10:24,640
This is a regular one.
Okay.

3906
03:10:24,641 --> 03:10:26,980
This is nothing.
Okay,

3907
03:10:26,981 --> 03:10:28,540
I'll look at that.
This is a guest look.

3908
03:10:28,570 --> 03:10:31,150
Watch this on one hand that that's just 
your job.

3909
03:10:31,710 --> 03:10:32,860
That's super.
Watch this.

3910
03:10:32,861 --> 03:10:37,861
Boom and bad.
Over seven foot four and he's six foot 

3911
03:10:37,861 --> 03:10:39,010
six.
He is against.

3912
03:10:39,220 --> 03:10:41,260
Look at this bad.
Okay.

3913
03:10:43,360 --> 03:10:48,360
My favorite was Daryl Dawkins destroyed 
the Baptist Joe Rogan over a hooker rice

3914
03:10:50,200 --> 03:10:55,200
or snorting coke with Darrell bock.
Look at that from the top of the 

3915
03:10:55,200 --> 03:10:57,670
refrigerator.
Put this back,

3916
03:10:57,671 --> 03:11:00,730
but just run this back dog.
He was.

3917
03:11:00,880 --> 03:11:03,220
He was going to call my podcast,
but he died three weeks later.

3918
03:11:05,110 --> 03:11:08,770
Three weeks before it was a dream.
I went to a psychic.

3919
03:11:08,980 --> 03:11:09,420
No,
no,

3920
03:11:09,421 --> 03:11:09,910
no.
He did.

3921
03:11:10,080 --> 03:11:11,710
That's against bill wall.
Look at this one,

3922
03:11:12,070 --> 03:11:14,820
I guess.
I guess that was a watch.

3923
03:11:14,840 --> 03:11:16,690
This one is against this guy.
Oh,

3924
03:11:16,720 --> 03:11:18,550
watch these tool.
That's beautiful.

3925
03:11:19,600 --> 03:11:24,600
The elevation man,
the problem is that's what everybody 

3926
03:11:24,600 --> 03:11:28,801
wants to say.
You don't want to see all the shit 

3927
03:11:28,801 --> 03:11:28,801
leading up to the.
It's like when I watched the whole.

3928
03:11:28,801 --> 03:11:30,360
This was dramatic.
Hurry up against the trump lexus.

3929
03:11:30,580 --> 03:11:34,600
Look at him because he kept calling for 
a file.

3930
03:11:34,810 --> 03:11:36,100
Look at him,
Bill Walton.

3931
03:11:36,100 --> 03:11:37,080
All his shit.
Look it up.

3932
03:11:37,360 --> 03:11:37,990
Look up,
bitch.

3933
03:11:38,020 --> 03:11:43,020
You're going to be this,
but I'm slamming right in your fucking 

3934
03:11:43,020 --> 03:11:43,020
face.
He but one was called for a foul.

3935
03:11:43,230 --> 03:11:47,590
He know what I feel like if you have a 
dishonorable claim at a foul.

3936
03:11:47,650 --> 03:11:50,230
If you're doing something like those 
soccer players do sometimes,

3937
03:11:51,280 --> 03:11:52,750
get this one.
You should lose points.

3938
03:11:52,780 --> 03:11:53,840
Look at this one,
Joe Rogan.

3939
03:11:53,841 --> 03:11:55,360
There's the one.
I Bet I won.

3940
03:11:55,630 --> 03:11:59,350
I had the sixes in Philly.
I guess Michael Cooper is shit.

3941
03:12:00,250 --> 03:12:04,180
Keep matching theme.
They gave their hamburgers.

3942
03:12:04,390 --> 03:12:06,970
I was down there looking at me.
He was getting they.

3943
03:12:06,980 --> 03:12:11,290
We're getting the point that game.
Okay.

3944
03:12:11,291 --> 03:12:16,291
Now go to 10 greatest Michael Jordan 
dunks about Mike Brown hair yourself for

3945
03:12:17,870 --> 03:12:20,290
fucking avatar movie.
Get on the toilet,

3946
03:12:20,410 --> 03:12:25,410
getting hit the ball boy for the niche.
Find out a lot about basketball players.

3947
03:12:25,571 --> 03:12:30,571
First of all,
do you know basketball players throw 

3948
03:12:30,571 --> 03:12:30,640
away their sneakers after every game?
It's crazy that a lot of them do.

3949
03:12:30,970 --> 03:12:33,510
So he would take the sneakers and sell 
them on the.

3950
03:12:33,610 --> 03:12:38,610
On the.
Before Ebay he would take the net 

3951
03:12:38,610 --> 03:12:41,911
sneakers and so look at this crazy shit 
man that looked like somebody press 

3952
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:47,960
controls and then about he did that.
He has some spectacular air time.

3953
03:12:48,210 --> 03:12:49,620
Oh man,
look at this.

3954
03:12:52,520 --> 03:12:57,520
He just flies in there man.
I wonder what's like the record 

3955
03:12:57,520 --> 03:12:57,520
distance?
Yeah.

3956
03:12:57,520 --> 03:13:01,110
I know I said from the free throw line,
but what's like the record distances 

3957
03:13:01,110 --> 03:13:04,290
someone's ever dunked from on top of the
key is way crazier yonker though 18.

3958
03:13:04,550 --> 03:13:09,550
It's 18.
It's 15 from the free throw and it's 18 

3959
03:13:09,550 --> 03:13:10,940
from the top of the key.
Somebody Julia serving.

3960
03:13:11,050 --> 03:13:12,290
Oh my.
All the time.

3961
03:13:12,320 --> 03:13:17,320
And the things that David Thompson,
he's shaking his head Jamie say saying 

3962
03:13:18,740 --> 03:13:20,690
no.
As far as anyone's done,

3963
03:13:20,960 --> 03:13:23,740
the free throws,
maybe $15.

3964
03:13:24,330 --> 03:13:29,330
That's still insane.
But now it's done like a foot or two 

3965
03:13:29,330 --> 03:13:33,731
behind it.
But have you ever seen Vince Carter's 

3966
03:13:33,731 --> 03:13:33,731
dunks?
No,

3967
03:13:33,731 --> 03:13:36,550
because that dude is 40.
Let's enjoy these first.

3968
03:13:36,560 --> 03:13:37,110
Yeah,
these are.

3969
03:13:37,330 --> 03:13:42,330
Go to Vince Carter,
but let's enjoy these for a moment 

3970
03:13:42,330 --> 03:13:42,330
because these are spectacular.
I mean,

3971
03:13:42,330 --> 03:13:43,620
Jordan was just another bar in it.
It's a.

3972
03:13:43,670 --> 03:13:46,280
it's a beautiful thing because the 
planet Thompson would go,

3973
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:52,000
I'm watching 30 for 30 and I want to 
call Joe Rogan and call them because I 

3974
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:56,201
know he's not that sport.
Like the one about Detroit when they 

3975
03:13:56,201 --> 03:13:57,300
beat him up really bad ass.
Yeah.

3976
03:13:57,320 --> 03:13:59,990
He decided to lift weights.
Trying to get on that maximum.

3977
03:14:00,790 --> 03:14:05,570
This ain't ever gonna happen again.
Look at the donkey was when he was done,

3978
03:14:05,720 --> 03:14:06,800
but Joe Rogan.
Oh yeah.

3979
03:14:06,801 --> 03:14:09,470
He used to wait.
Look at the way he held his hair because

3980
03:14:09,770 --> 03:14:14,770
he went and got on.
Really lifted against the Detroit 

3981
03:14:14,770 --> 03:14:18,610
Pistons,
but Joe Rogan has a basketball 

3982
03:14:18,610 --> 03:14:21,010
enthusiast and I called Dama wherever.
There's only one the greatest dunked the

3983
03:14:21,011 --> 03:14:24,830
ball time and because he jumped over a 
motherfucker who did that.

3984
03:14:27,020 --> 03:14:32,020
That's what I'm talking to Joe.
You Got Mad ally Drexler Against 

3985
03:14:32,020 --> 03:14:33,620
Louisville.
Nineteen 81,

3986
03:14:34,010 --> 03:14:34,350
right?
Right,

3987
03:14:34,450 --> 03:14:39,450
right.
Against the wizards or dunk and Houston 

3988
03:14:41,061 --> 03:14:44,630
was called five slamma Jamma because 
that's all they did was dunked.

3989
03:14:44,690 --> 03:14:49,690
There's a few athletes that I feel like 
even from our era you could bring to 

3990
03:14:49,851 --> 03:14:51,770
today and there will be super 
successful.

3991
03:14:51,771 --> 03:14:56,771
Like Marvin Hagler is one of them.
I feel like I'm going to go get ready.

3992
03:14:57,800 --> 03:14:59,170
Boom.
No,

3993
03:14:59,180 --> 03:15:00,200
that's not the ones are that.

3994
03:15:04,050 --> 03:15:05,520
That's not the one.
No.

3995
03:15:07,880 --> 03:15:12,880
There's a few athletes that I think you 
could take today and they would be super

3996
03:15:13,101 --> 03:15:14,860
successful.
Like for short,

3997
03:15:14,861 --> 03:15:18,320
Julia Surveying for sure.
Michael Jordan for sure.

3998
03:15:18,470 --> 03:15:20,330
For sure.
Magic Johnson for sure.

3999
03:15:20,390 --> 03:15:21,290
You know,
no matter what,

4000
03:15:21,291 --> 03:15:26,291
like you bring them into this era where 
there'll be successful in almost any 

4001
03:15:26,291 --> 03:15:26,610
area.
I'll never forget I was at a ball.

4002
03:15:26,640 --> 03:15:30,200
What Vince Carter did.
I was at a bar one night and there was a

4003
03:15:30,201 --> 03:15:32,870
Cuban dude and he was passed out like 
this.

4004
03:15:32,871 --> 03:15:34,940
Joe Rogan.
Can you find the video?

4005
03:15:34,941 --> 03:15:35,980
Joey?
Have the do the.

4006
03:15:36,140 --> 03:15:38,200
He jumped over the dude.
I've never seen it.

4007
03:15:38,970 --> 03:15:42,170
It doesn't look,
but look at this shit.

4008
03:15:42,800 --> 03:15:44,180
What's this?
This is Vince Carter.

4009
03:15:48,870 --> 03:15:50,550
Oh my God.
It's amazing.

4010
03:15:50,850 --> 03:15:54,030
He rubbed his nuts on that dude's head 
washed out again.

4011
03:15:54,390 --> 03:15:57,060
Watch this.
He rubbed his nuts on that detail.

4012
03:15:57,061 --> 03:15:57,410
Tell.
Yeah,

4013
03:15:57,420 --> 03:16:00,270
it's incredible.
He went over that do 10 just do to still

4014
03:16:00,271 --> 03:16:03,900
dumps like this and he's 40.
That's insane.

4015
03:16:04,080 --> 03:16:06,120
That's an athlete.
When we were in high school,

4016
03:16:06,180 --> 03:16:09,060
he was in high school for a minute,
close to us.

4017
03:16:09,090 --> 03:16:14,090
I jumped over that guy.
They would show his high school 

4018
03:16:14,090 --> 03:16:17,040
highlights on local news like it was.
They would cover it like an NBA game.

4019
03:16:17,160 --> 03:16:17,610
Dude,
look,

4020
03:16:17,770 --> 03:16:22,770
look,
I know he's rubbing his tick on that 

4021
03:16:22,770 --> 03:16:25,071
guy's ear.
Watch while you fucking my fucking is 

4022
03:16:25,071 --> 03:16:25,071
fucking face,
right?

4023
03:16:25,071 --> 03:16:27,310
He said mind fucking them directly 
through the ear and then slams that.

4024
03:16:27,390 --> 03:16:29,100
That's insane.
Yeah.

4025
03:16:29,280 --> 03:16:31,080
No,
Roy Jones Jr was like that.

4026
03:16:31,400 --> 03:16:33,450
Oh yeah.
Roy Jones Jr in his prime,

4027
03:16:33,720 --> 03:16:36,330
had some athleticism that didn't even 
make sense.

4028
03:16:36,480 --> 03:16:41,480
He was able to land a lead left Hook 
instead of a jab or a lot of guys shot 

4029
03:16:41,480 --> 03:16:42,810
in a jab.
Roy Jones Jr.

4030
03:16:42,990 --> 03:16:46,230
He like most of the time,
lead with a lead left hook.

4031
03:16:46,380 --> 03:16:49,410
WHoa,
jesus.

4032
03:16:49,830 --> 03:16:54,830
I got to fly around the rim and dunk.
That's the arman rim dunk.

4033
03:16:56,701 --> 03:16:58,800
Ladies and gentlemen.
It's much more difficult than the right.

4034
03:16:58,890 --> 03:17:03,890
Think about a.
You've got to worry about breaking your 

4035
03:17:03,890 --> 03:17:05,790
arm.
Thompson had a 48 junk vertical way 

4036
03:17:05,790 --> 03:17:05,790
inch.
I think about that.

4037
03:17:05,790 --> 03:17:10,191
That was 30 years ago.
I can't imagine the kind of vertical 

4038
03:17:10,191 --> 03:17:11,360
jumps.
College player.

4039
03:17:11,420 --> 03:17:15,750
I got to be up to 60 slash 55 inches.
those defensive backs.

4040
03:17:16,650 --> 03:17:17,790
michael irvin,
michael,

4041
03:17:17,791 --> 03:17:19,470
wherever we could jump four feet in the 
air.

4042
03:17:19,570 --> 03:17:21,840
Yeah,
that's how he became like a one one.

4043
03:17:22,090 --> 03:17:25,930
He's afraid because the giants with the 
blonde hair back.

4044
03:17:26,190 --> 03:17:27,840
I see him at jake waves.
Just put.

4045
03:17:28,070 --> 03:17:31,250
Ain't no bigger than here though.
A old though.

4046
03:17:31,260 --> 03:17:33,300
Back then it was not that much bigger 
than jake.

4047
03:17:33,440 --> 03:17:35,190
Glaser's got a hell of a gym.
Huh?

4048
03:17:36,120 --> 03:17:39,290
I saw stallone was working out there 
with chocolate dal's.

4049
03:17:39,300 --> 03:17:42,630
Like what kind of chris you have?
You go see that.

4050
03:17:42,810 --> 03:17:46,400
Football players.
Fighters all day long training.

4051
03:17:46,440 --> 03:17:47,370
Um,
what's it called again?

4052
03:17:47,550 --> 03:17:51,510
A something optimum performance and 
breakable.

4053
03:17:52,340 --> 03:17:53,140
Breakable.
Yeah.

4054
03:17:53,650 --> 03:17:56,550
The oWner is a man.
Good move on his part.

4055
03:17:56,551 --> 03:17:59,950
He wasn't back up from chicago.
That's a,

4056
03:17:59,970 --> 03:18:01,350
that's a smart move,
you know,

4057
03:18:01,380 --> 03:18:03,550
be a part of some sort of a cool 
strength.

4058
03:18:03,570 --> 03:18:07,630
We don't look at that dog.
This is a brand hand.

4059
03:18:08,370 --> 03:18:10,230
Well,
athletes are always getting better,

4060
03:18:10,260 --> 03:18:15,260
right?
If you go back to baseball from the 19 

4061
03:18:15,260 --> 03:18:16,920
fifties and then go to baseball in 2017,
it seems better and better.

4062
03:18:16,921 --> 03:18:21,921
Athletes,
you're seeing people that are Just 

4063
03:18:21,921 --> 03:18:21,921
faster,
smarter,

4064
03:18:21,921 --> 03:18:21,921
trained,
better use,

4065
03:18:21,921 --> 03:18:22,530
better nutrition.

4066
03:18:22,600 --> 03:18:24,840
They're optImizing themselves the best 
they can.

4067
03:18:25,120 --> 03:18:30,120
The question is like,
I wonder like genetically what's 

4068
03:18:30,120 --> 03:18:32,481
happening?
I wonder if like people genetically are 

4069
03:18:32,481 --> 03:18:35,001
getting bigger and faster.
I wonder if it's like a little slight 

4070
03:18:35,001 --> 03:18:35,850
uptick that will one day maybe 20 years 
from now,

4071
03:18:35,851 --> 03:18:40,851
30 years now registering in a big way 
because you've got to wonder with all 

4072
03:18:40,851 --> 03:18:43,950
these people competing in crossfit and 
all the strength and conditioning stuff,

4073
03:18:43,980 --> 03:18:48,190
people's bodies might start literally 
thinking they have to work harder again.

4074
03:18:48,660 --> 03:18:50,110
They have to get stronger and bigger.
Again,

4075
03:18:50,140 --> 03:18:55,140
people might get bigger.
This is my terrible understanding of 

4076
03:18:55,140 --> 03:18:56,980
genetics as applied.
I'm sold on it.

4077
03:18:57,270 --> 03:19:01,210
Just on that alone.
The public peer reviewed pApers did.

4078
03:19:01,270 --> 03:19:03,590
I've spent the cub dog.
I'm waiting,

4079
03:19:03,600 --> 03:19:05,860
I know the thRee weeks I spit in the 
cup,

4080
03:19:05,861 --> 03:19:08,560
just hit home related to.
I did it.

4081
03:19:08,561 --> 03:19:09,620
The mr.
Com,

4082
03:19:09,880 --> 03:19:12,870
do you see that thing about all those 
white racists were found out they were a

4083
03:19:13,150 --> 03:19:18,150
black people in their past and then they
credit the test for that reason.

4084
03:19:22,890 --> 03:19:26,800
You know who you can taLk shit about 
because if you find a certain percentage

4085
03:19:27,040 --> 03:19:29,260
like I could talk shit about italians.
Sure.

4086
03:19:29,500 --> 03:19:31,050
Because I'm mostly italian.
Yeah.

4087
03:19:31,090 --> 03:19:36,090
You know,
so most people wouldn't consider it a 

4088
03:19:36,090 --> 03:19:37,981
bad thing when you move.
Silliness got raped by the noise and 

4089
03:19:38,500 --> 03:19:43,500
then the more and then the sicilians one
night on the night of the vest was in 

4090
03:19:43,500 --> 03:19:45,910
1600 got up and they cut the dick off 
and shoved them in their fucking mouth.

4091
03:19:46,390 --> 03:19:49,300
That's why you can't talk about rape and
for the most resIlient.

4092
03:19:49,360 --> 03:19:52,270
Neither the vespers is an old sicilian 
tradition to go.

4093
03:19:52,570 --> 03:19:54,610
That's why those sicilians or go with 
knives.

4094
03:19:54,670 --> 03:19:56,920
Crazy.
Now millions of go with knives.

4095
03:19:56,921 --> 03:19:59,110
They tell you,
keep them at arm's distance.

4096
03:19:59,510 --> 03:20:04,510
Would olsher chileans don't fuck with 
them because they got those knives that 

4097
03:20:04,510 --> 03:20:05,920
go with those knives and shit.
It's crazy.

4098
03:20:06,460 --> 03:20:09,850
Cubans.
My sister's dark skinned and then I look

4099
03:20:09,851 --> 03:20:12,600
at my cousin who's my skin and his 
sister.

4100
03:20:12,610 --> 03:20:17,610
The singer is dark skin show.
I know there's some african shit in my 

4101
03:20:17,610 --> 03:20:18,610
fucking blood.
It's Cuba.

4102
03:20:18,710 --> 03:20:20,290
Who's um,
what's the band's name?

4103
03:20:20,291 --> 03:20:22,250
X alfonso.
Aggie.

4104
03:20:22,430 --> 03:20:25,510
Aggie band.

4105
03:20:25,530 --> 03:20:26,330
Phonto.
Is that it?

4106
03:20:26,350 --> 03:20:30,040
His name is becky and her name is emma.
I've got it on my phone.

4107
03:20:32,080 --> 03:20:36,430
If you ever go to his cousin's cousin,
amazing band.

4108
03:20:36,450 --> 03:20:38,130
Really do.
They're really,

4109
03:20:38,240 --> 03:20:40,060
really good.
But they the fuck the ria.

4110
03:20:40,570 --> 03:20:42,550
So yeah,
here iT is.

4111
03:20:42,590 --> 03:20:44,530
X alfonso,
back to my mail.

4112
03:20:44,740 --> 03:20:46,480
Gimme some gimme some volume on this 
shit.

4113
03:20:46,590 --> 03:20:49,120
They're really good dude.
I mean no bullshit.

4114
03:20:49,430 --> 03:20:52,360
Listen to this on my way to the comedy 
store all the time.

4115
03:20:52,630 --> 03:20:55,180
I get pumped up because I don't know 
what the fuck they're saying.

4116
03:20:55,360 --> 03:21:00,360
So just for me just feels good.
It's like celebratory and I get into my 

4117
03:21:00,360 --> 03:21:03,700
own head thinking about my material.
I get pumped up listening to this night.

4118
03:21:03,730 --> 03:21:08,730
you sent me a video you were looking at,
you were listening to something else 

4119
03:21:08,730 --> 03:21:08,730
like italian music.
I always do that.

4120
03:21:08,730 --> 03:21:13,380
Yeah.
I always listened to language that I 

4121
03:21:13,380 --> 03:21:13,540
don't understand.
So you don't think about the words?

4122
03:21:13,600 --> 03:21:15,070
Yeah,
I don't think about the words at all.

4123
03:21:15,550 --> 03:21:16,330
See,
this doesn't.

4124
03:21:16,331 --> 03:21:18,910
I don't understand what this is and 
there's.

4125
03:21:19,660 --> 03:21:21,820
There's ignorance in it,
but there's also a freedom.

4126
03:21:21,940 --> 03:21:26,940
So freedom is that I can hear the 
beautiful sound of his voice and not 

4127
03:21:26,940 --> 03:21:28,870
have any context to it.
No,

4128
03:21:28,871 --> 03:21:33,871
no.
Like whatever his messages or anything 

4129
03:21:33,871 --> 03:21:36,900
and I can have it in the background and 
100 percent concentrated on what I'm 

4130
03:21:36,900 --> 03:21:39,280
trying to do and just enjoy it.
And it's like an instrument.

4131
03:21:39,400 --> 03:21:41,890
Yeah.
Like if you like listening to a,

4132
03:21:42,430 --> 03:21:47,430
a shooting star by bad company,
you johnny was a schoolboy when they 

4133
03:21:47,430 --> 03:21:52,241
heard his first beatles' song.
That's going to change the way you feel 

4134
03:21:52,241 --> 03:21:53,120
like you hear about that.
If you're writing about a certain thing,

4135
03:21:53,121 --> 03:21:54,730
you're not gonna be able to concentrate 
on your subject.

4136
03:21:55,260 --> 03:22:00,260
I think it was from there.
It didn't take him long and when I was 

4137
03:22:00,260 --> 03:22:02,420
in high school,
everybody wanted to be that guy.

4138
03:22:02,600 --> 03:22:05,690
Everybody wanted to be that bright star 
that burnt out,

4139
03:22:06,280 --> 03:22:07,700
didn't fade away,
and everybody's like,

4140
03:22:07,701 --> 03:22:09,410
man,
we lost johnny.

4141
03:22:10,850 --> 03:22:12,920
When he goes,
I love when he goes,

4142
03:22:13,220 --> 03:22:18,220
don'T you know,
you know that you fucking tremendous.

4143
03:22:20,980 --> 03:22:23,370
It's great fucking mail.
Yeah,

4144
03:22:23,570 --> 03:22:25,270
I'll look at his sister if you scroll 
down,

4145
03:22:25,640 --> 03:22:28,940
show him my sister.
So my whole family is like this with the

4146
03:22:28,941 --> 03:22:33,510
male is light skin,
but my sister is dark skin.

4147
03:22:34,360 --> 03:22:35,820
I just said fuck it.
I got it.

4148
03:22:35,821 --> 03:22:40,821
And then some other kids sent me 
paperwork that I was related to some 

4149
03:22:40,821 --> 03:22:43,931
italian navy guy called Louis Diaz from 
ninth to from 1832.

4150
03:22:44,670 --> 03:22:45,920
So I said,
enough with this shit,

4151
03:22:46,370 --> 03:22:51,370
let me just spit in a cup.
Plus it also tells you where your 

4152
03:22:51,370 --> 03:22:53,090
genetics guy and what you might die of 
what you might get cancer have.

4153
03:22:53,091 --> 03:22:58,091
You might have cardiovascular disease.
It tells you what your family did a 

4154
03:22:58,091 --> 03:23:02,801
family reunion in 2000 and they hired 
this genealogy expert and they thought 

4155
03:23:02,811 --> 03:23:06,050
like this would be like the big 
culmination on saturday.

4156
03:23:06,230 --> 03:23:09,800
Who to present a family history that 
everybody in the family.

4157
03:23:09,830 --> 03:23:12,350
It's like 30,
40 people there this weekend.

4158
03:23:12,740 --> 03:23:12,970
No,
no,

4159
03:23:12,980 --> 03:23:14,720
no.
This was in the year 2000.

4160
03:23:15,290 --> 03:23:18,440
And then that guy started telling us 
about this,

4161
03:23:18,790 --> 03:23:23,790
uh,
our first guy that came over from Spain 

4162
03:23:23,790 --> 03:23:25,380
and then where he landed and like 17,
20.

4163
03:23:25,430 --> 03:23:25,890
Everyone's like,
oh,

4164
03:23:25,891 --> 03:23:27,810
that's cool.
And then he was just like,

4165
03:23:27,890 --> 03:23:32,890
he was a real piece of shit and like he 
killed somebody and he went to,

4166
03:23:34,040 --> 03:23:39,040
he went to prison and then he,
he was stealing from people and when he 

4167
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:41,570
died he left 60 slave to this person and
everybody was like,

4168
03:23:41,600 --> 03:23:44,300
well,
let's go have dinner now.

4169
03:23:44,750 --> 03:23:46,730
Yeah.
Hey,

4170
03:23:46,740 --> 03:23:51,740
we're baffled.
Every baffles me because diaz is a 

4171
03:23:52,790 --> 03:23:53,810
cuban.
Yeah.

4172
03:23:53,811 --> 03:23:56,030
And then there's the diaz brothers that 
are mexican,

4173
03:23:56,120 --> 03:23:56,470
right?
Yeah.

4174
03:23:56,471 --> 03:23:56,930
Yeah.
Okay.

4175
03:23:56,931 --> 03:23:58,950
So that means our relatives came from 
Spain spraying.

4176
03:23:58,951 --> 03:24:02,660
we went to an island and the other one 
went through Mexico through somewhere.

4177
03:24:02,670 --> 03:24:04,260
And I look at those deals,
brothers and like,

4178
03:24:04,261 --> 03:24:07,220
well I got this guy.
We're both with the of us retarded.

4179
03:24:07,850 --> 03:24:11,350
There's got to be some type of blood 
that we shed because we're not all bad,

4180
03:24:11,351 --> 03:24:14,120
you know what I'm saying?
But there's also a d as in puerto rico.

4181
03:24:14,121 --> 03:24:17,790
Right?
And that's a different kind of ds.

4182
03:24:17,800 --> 03:24:19,510
Then the mexIcan ds to,
you know,

4183
03:24:19,520 --> 03:24:19,990
it's,
it's,

4184
03:24:20,010 --> 03:24:25,010
you know,
it's really interesting once you hear 

4185
03:24:25,010 --> 03:24:27,101
enough spanish and you hear the 
difference between like being friends 

4186
03:24:27,101 --> 03:24:29,981
with you and listening to a lot of cuban
people talk like cuban people have like 

4187
03:24:29,981 --> 03:24:33,811
a very certain rhythm and then puerto 
ricans have like a different kind of 

4188
03:24:33,811 --> 03:24:34,250
rhythm and mexicans have their own 
rhythm.

4189
03:24:34,490 --> 03:24:36,040
All differenT changes.
Man.

4190
03:24:36,830 --> 03:24:38,690
the funny thing about hanging out with 
thomas,

4191
03:24:39,110 --> 03:24:43,880
people look it up and he looks like a 
brosky from like Wisconsin or something.

4192
03:24:43,890 --> 03:24:44,100
They don't

4193
03:24:44,100 --> 03:24:49,100
realize he speaks fluent spanish.
So people will talk shit in spanish in 

4194
03:24:49,100 --> 03:24:50,580
front of you all the time.
about me sometimes.

4195
03:24:50,620 --> 03:24:52,320
Yeah,
all the time.

4196
03:24:52,740 --> 03:24:54,350
They would never guess what,
what,

4197
03:24:54,540 --> 03:24:56,160
what happens when you drop it on them?

4198
03:24:57,810 --> 03:24:58,960
It depends,
man.

4199
03:24:58,961 --> 03:24:59,650
Like,
uh,

4200
03:24:59,770 --> 03:25:02,080
sometimes you get a,
like a big,

4201
03:25:02,081 --> 03:25:03,850
you can see the shame wash over them,
you know,

4202
03:25:04,230 --> 03:25:06,450
they say something rude at the end.
I'll say like,

4203
03:25:06,460 --> 03:25:08,140
have a nice day.
I think like,

4204
03:25:08,190 --> 03:25:09,670
I hope you have a great day rest of your
day.

4205
03:25:10,390 --> 03:25:14,920
And they're like.
And then sometimes they laugh,

4206
03:25:14,950 --> 03:25:15,850
sometimes,
you know,

4207
03:25:15,940 --> 03:25:18,250
I've had it go even.
I remember in high school my cousin came

4208
03:25:18,251 --> 03:25:20,770
from Peru and we went into,
it was the reverse.

4209
03:25:20,771 --> 03:25:24,340
We went into a gnc.
Yeah,

4210
03:25:24,370 --> 03:25:29,370
we were like 14.
And I go in spanish because he's 

4211
03:25:29,370 --> 03:25:32,641
visiting.
I tell them just places easy to steal 

4212
03:25:32,641 --> 03:25:34,070
from.
And then I don't realize that the,

4213
03:25:34,071 --> 03:25:39,071
uh,
the lady working at the store was 

4214
03:25:39,071 --> 03:25:41,631
spanish,
so instead of she just let us kind of 

4215
03:25:41,631 --> 03:25:44,581
look around and then,
and then she started speaking us in 

4216
03:25:44,581 --> 03:25:44,581
spanish and we were like,
oh,

4217
03:25:44,830 --> 03:25:46,660
we thought we were speaking to some 
crazy code,

4218
03:25:46,990 --> 03:25:47,680
you know,
like,

4219
03:25:48,310 --> 03:25:49,780
this isn't fucking,
you know,

4220
03:25:50,020 --> 03:25:51,730
farsi that you're going to run into a 
lot.

4221
03:25:51,731 --> 03:25:54,250
It was spanish,
but it happens all the time in.

4222
03:25:54,470 --> 03:25:55,930
They also,
I also realized it's probably,

4223
03:25:55,931 --> 03:25:58,330
I don't know if it happens to you 
because I don't look spanish.

4224
03:25:58,650 --> 03:26:02,680
A lot of times spanish speaking,
people don't want me to speak spanish to

4225
03:26:02,681 --> 03:26:05,380
them,
was that if they're here,

4226
03:26:05,740 --> 03:26:08,140
they're,
they're not appreciating that you're not

4227
03:26:08,141 --> 03:26:13,141
letting make,
letting them show you that they could 

4228
03:26:13,141 --> 03:26:13,141
speak english.
A lot of times that's,

4229
03:26:13,141 --> 03:26:13,141
it

4230
03:26:13,141 --> 03:26:17,140
just tanked because americans wouldn't 
give a fuck if you were over in Italy 

4231
03:26:17,140 --> 03:26:20,711
and so started talking english and you 
had like one of those translators you 

4232
03:26:20,711 --> 03:26:20,711
trying to like,
um,

4233
03:26:20,711 --> 03:26:25,450
yo soy,
try to talk to him and he just started 

4234
03:26:25,450 --> 03:26:25,450
saying,
no problem.

4235
03:26:25,450 --> 03:26:28,490
I speak perfect fluent english.
Thank god it's just talking here.

4236
03:26:28,491 --> 03:26:30,140
It's different though.
You would never be like,

4237
03:26:30,200 --> 03:26:35,200
oh,
let me struggle sometimes to somebody 

4238
03:26:35,200 --> 03:26:35,610
that I speak way better spanish than 
they speak english real.

4239
03:26:35,620 --> 03:26:38,630
It's still insist on keeping it english.
That's rough.

4240
03:26:38,660 --> 03:26:43,660
It gives them like with me,
they look at me for a minute and then 

4241
03:26:43,660 --> 03:26:44,540
once I start going off.
Yeah,

4242
03:26:44,870 --> 03:26:46,130
like those.
Hello?

4243
03:26:46,190 --> 03:26:48,130
Como?
Anybody could say those?

4244
03:26:48,190 --> 03:26:49,850
Yeah.
It's when they asked me,

4245
03:26:49,851 --> 03:26:54,851
how's your day going?
Like when somebody spanish system and 

4246
03:26:54,851 --> 03:26:57,741
get that,
I always say I eat for how long 

4247
03:26:57,741 --> 03:27:00,970
[inaudible] been compounded and they 
look at me and I tell them I'm here 

4248
03:27:00,970 --> 03:27:02,660
fighting with these fucking white people
on a day and they look at me and go,

4249
03:27:02,661 --> 03:27:03,150
oh,
okay.

4250
03:27:03,800 --> 03:27:08,800
He's okay.
But the guy at the weed store at 

4251
03:27:08,800 --> 03:27:08,800
cushman.
Yeah,

4252
03:27:08,800 --> 03:27:10,730
they used to be a little security guard 
and I didn't say nothing to him.

4253
03:27:10,760 --> 03:27:15,760
He never looked at my name.
He would just look at joey or something 

4254
03:27:15,760 --> 03:27:18,170
and he would go away that go the ate the
fat italian,

4255
03:27:18,840 --> 03:27:22,640
just let him roll for like eight times 
and one day I said,

4256
03:27:22,641 --> 03:27:27,641
oh yeah,
you're going to feel and look at that 

4257
03:27:27,641 --> 03:27:30,150
particular pet or the normal are porter 
and his face turned back like he had a 

4258
03:27:32,721 --> 03:27:34,970
gun and everything and he got paid 
because they said,

4259
03:27:35,430 --> 03:27:38,390
never disrespect me and I'll never 
disrespect you.

4260
03:27:38,391 --> 03:27:41,350
You son of a bitCh.
He just turned pale a week.

4261
03:27:41,351 --> 03:27:42,160
Ladies,
I come in,

4262
03:27:42,400 --> 03:27:44,670
I'm going to get you discounts on weed 
up in the valleys.

4263
03:27:44,680 --> 03:27:45,310
Sure,
sure.

4264
03:27:45,380 --> 03:27:47,170
Because he.
I lived in hollywood at the time,

4265
03:27:47,171 --> 03:27:49,630
but I would catch people,
but it's really weird.

4266
03:27:49,690 --> 03:27:50,830
Yeah,
some people don't.

4267
03:27:51,010 --> 03:27:52,420
Some people don't.
Some people are cool with it.

4268
03:27:52,870 --> 03:27:57,870
Dude,
you ain't seen somebody kill until you 

4269
03:27:57,870 --> 03:28:00,751
seen joey diaz do half spanish.
Half english in miami at the improv.

4270
03:28:00,911 --> 03:28:04,870
I bet in 2004,
2000.

4271
03:28:04,871 --> 03:28:05,740
Three,
2004.

4272
03:28:05,741 --> 03:28:09,140
When that place was crazy.
Crazy.

4273
03:28:09,720 --> 03:28:11,090
either one.
I could go off.

4274
03:28:11,170 --> 03:28:14,770
I'm sure I could go.
Was really funny in spanish.

4275
03:28:14,800 --> 03:28:18,700
People get grades I imitate is the 
people that you know.

4276
03:28:18,701 --> 03:28:21,570
I grew up around the cuban guys I grew 
up around with.

4277
03:28:21,590 --> 03:28:24,940
Very funny.
I was telling a friend of mine,

4278
03:28:24,941 --> 03:28:29,941
he that was bartending in highschool,
adequate highschool and bartend and 

4279
03:28:29,941 --> 03:28:29,941
there was this bookie that hung out 
there.

4280
03:28:29,941 --> 03:28:34,861
His name was our nardo and he didn't 
speak no english and I used to talk to 

4281
03:28:34,861 --> 03:28:35,140
him.
He was a cuban do built.

4282
03:28:35,150 --> 03:28:40,150
We had a big,
big gut and one day he was sitting on a 

4283
03:28:40,150 --> 03:28:42,931
chair like this and my buddy was joked 
and he's telling them about your yo yo 

4284
03:28:43,100 --> 03:28:43,790
come by.

4285
03:28:44,260 --> 03:28:45,460
And he goes,
I gotta go.

4286
03:28:45,461 --> 03:28:46,660
My friend goes,
what are you going to go home?

4287
03:28:46,720 --> 03:28:49,030
We didn't even speak spanish or nardo.
He goes,

4288
03:28:49,250 --> 03:28:52,690
well,
and my friend goes,

4289
03:28:52,691 --> 03:28:57,691
what he talking about?
I never forgot nardo was sitting in a 

4290
03:28:57,691 --> 03:28:58,870
bar chat and go back and he just started
going,

4291
03:28:59,170 --> 03:29:00,730
oh,
well when I go home now,

4292
03:29:01,150 --> 03:29:06,150
forget it.
And they started making believe like he 

4293
03:29:06,150 --> 03:29:06,150
was jerking off and he would make the 
noises.

4294
03:29:06,150 --> 03:29:08,740
I have never been to.
This bar is looking at a decade now,

4295
03:29:09,100 --> 03:29:11,130
but he's going,
I wouldn't,

4296
03:29:11,131 --> 03:29:13,420
he would come,
he would pop back in the chair and go,

4297
03:29:13,530 --> 03:29:14,650
blah,
blah,

4298
03:29:14,940 --> 03:29:16,140
blah,
blah.

4299
03:29:17,690 --> 03:29:22,690
The whole fucking bought fucking.
And then he would sit back and go,

4300
03:29:27,890 --> 03:29:29,270
oh,
oh,

4301
03:29:29,300 --> 03:29:30,190
you're living.
Yes,

4302
03:29:30,191 --> 03:29:34,060
I bought.
He would play out the whole thing.

4303
03:29:34,710 --> 03:29:36,910
Jerking off hands.

4304
03:29:40,530 --> 03:29:41,010
Oh,

4305
03:29:46,470 --> 03:29:50,220
the people you run into in your daily 
life.

4306
03:29:50,910 --> 03:29:53,040
If you do that today,
they'll put you in jail.

4307
03:29:54,030 --> 03:29:54,660
I,
uh,

4308
03:29:54,720 --> 03:29:56,010
have you.
If you do that today,

4309
03:29:56,340 --> 03:29:59,130
have you leaned back in a bar and start 
jerking off into the sky?

4310
03:29:59,220 --> 03:30:00,780
Oh my god.
Didn't put you in jail.

4311
03:30:00,900 --> 03:30:04,020
That's sexual assault just to do the 
impersonation.

4312
03:30:04,050 --> 03:30:06,600
I'm sure didn't jim morris and getting 
in trouble for that?

4313
03:30:06,660 --> 03:30:10,640
He pulled his dick out.
He pulled his dick out of my la.

4314
03:30:10,650 --> 03:30:11,110
Yeah,
it was.

4315
03:30:11,770 --> 03:30:14,070
He pulled his dick out.
Famous concert.

4316
03:30:14,520 --> 03:30:17,190
But I thought that during mr.
Mojo rising,

4317
03:30:17,640 --> 03:30:20,150
he would make believe he was whacking 
off when he got arrested.

4318
03:30:20,170 --> 03:30:20,640
I think,
uh,

4319
03:30:20,850 --> 03:30:25,850
our boy who got arrested,
the comedian for doing something on 

4320
03:30:25,850 --> 03:30:26,850
stage,
like a sexual something.

4321
03:30:27,240 --> 03:30:28,590
Which guy?
The original guy,

4322
03:30:28,660 --> 03:30:33,660
lenny lenny did.
I think he just got arrested for 

4323
03:30:33,660 --> 03:30:37,101
talking.
I don't think he ever pulled his dick 

4324
03:30:37,101 --> 03:30:37,101
out.
I think that.

4325
03:30:37,101 --> 03:30:38,940
I'm not saying it was thicker.
I mean like doing the motion.

4326
03:30:39,130 --> 03:30:39,800
Oh,
maybe.

4327
03:30:40,300 --> 03:30:41,360
Yeah.
Yeah,

4328
03:30:41,660 --> 03:30:46,660
yeah.
We definitely get prosecuted for 

4329
03:30:46,660 --> 03:30:47,640
profanity.
Was iT sam?

4330
03:30:47,910 --> 03:30:49,670
Jim morrison's.
Many of the,

4331
03:30:49,671 --> 03:30:54,671
nearly 12,000
youths said they found the bearded 

4332
03:30:54,671 --> 03:30:55,730
singers exhibition,
disgusting,

4333
03:30:56,090 --> 03:31:01,090
including included in the audience were 
hundreds of [inaudible] escorted junior 

4334
03:31:01,090 --> 03:31:05,831
and senior high school girls.
Morrison appeared to masturbate in full 

4335
03:31:05,831 --> 03:31:06,530
view of the audience,
screamed,

4336
03:31:06,531 --> 03:31:08,420
upset idis,
and exposed himself.

4337
03:31:08,540 --> 03:31:12,650
He also got violent slugged,
several and in parentheses,

4338
03:31:12,830 --> 03:31:17,830
concert promoters and through one of 
them off the stage before he himself was

4339
03:31:19,131 --> 03:31:21,680
hurled into the crowd with his dick 
hanging out.

4340
03:31:22,250 --> 03:31:23,750
Wow.
Interesting.

4341
03:31:24,560 --> 03:31:28,010
He says to this day,
Morrison's bandmates denied this version

4342
03:31:28,011 --> 03:31:30,980
of events as a guitarist.
Robby krieger explained the spinner.

4343
03:31:31,310 --> 03:31:33,520
They were complaining about jim whipping
out onstage,

4344
03:31:33,680 --> 03:31:38,270
which he didn't do.
500 photos were entered as evidence that

4345
03:31:38,290 --> 03:31:41,060
trial and not one of them showed 
anythIng of the sort.

4346
03:31:41,061 --> 03:31:43,040
Regardless,
after rejecting a plea bargain,

4347
03:31:43,230 --> 03:31:48,230
the singer was found guilty of 
misdemeanor counts of indecent exposure 

4348
03:31:48,230 --> 03:31:51,521
and open profanity and sensitive 
sentenced to prison time and find the 

4349
03:31:51,521 --> 03:31:54,080
case was on appeal at the time of his 
death.

4350
03:31:54,290 --> 03:31:55,490
July third,
19,

4351
03:31:55,491 --> 03:31:56,720
71.
Wow.

4352
03:31:57,020 --> 03:32:02,020
Interesting.
And cleMency board in 2010 voted to 

4353
03:32:02,020 --> 03:32:04,730
pardon the singer more than 40 years 
later.

4354
03:32:04,800 --> 03:32:09,800
I'm who the fuck those would happen if 
they don't have a picture of his dick 

4355
03:32:09,800 --> 03:32:09,800
out.
I thought they had a picture of it.

4356
03:32:09,800 --> 03:32:11,090
If they don't have a picture of his dick
out,

4357
03:32:11,150 --> 03:32:13,490
somebody could have yelled his dick's 
out,

4358
03:32:13,700 --> 03:32:15,800
which is just like yelling fire in a 
crowded building.

4359
03:32:15,830 --> 03:32:18,560
He started hearing thing at the end of 
the la woman,

4360
03:32:18,950 --> 03:32:23,950
ms dot mojo raja,
and then at the end he would make 

4361
03:32:23,950 --> 03:32:27,290
believers rise.
Rise route.

4362
03:32:27,920 --> 03:32:29,990
whoa.
Yeah.

4363
03:32:29,991 --> 03:32:32,870
Maybe to them it looked like 
masturbation to him.

4364
03:32:32,871 --> 03:32:34,370
It looked like he was playing like an 
air guitar.

4365
03:32:35,320 --> 03:32:37,010
Right?
He pretended to jerk off.

4366
03:32:37,790 --> 03:32:39,680
Yeah.
Maybe you're not allowed to do that back

4367
03:32:39,681 --> 03:32:40,220
then.
Really?

4368
03:32:40,370 --> 03:32:44,180
I would deny like a good 40 percent of 
all of our material.

4369
03:32:44,360 --> 03:32:49,360
It's a lot of it.
If someone told you you can't fake jerk 

4370
03:32:49,360 --> 03:32:50,870
off on stage of life,
am I going to make this bit work?

4371
03:32:50,900 --> 03:32:52,730
There's a couple of specials that are 
gone entirely.

4372
03:32:52,780 --> 03:32:55,280
Fuck.
That was one of my best ones.

4373
03:32:55,830 --> 03:33:00,830
Shit broke it.
They edit out all the stroke and their 

4374
03:33:00,830 --> 03:33:00,830
parts.
You'd be like,

4375
03:33:00,830 --> 03:33:01,220
oh,
I'm so limited in my game.

4376
03:33:01,890 --> 03:33:04,520
God dammit.
Get the fuck out of here.

4377
03:33:04,550 --> 03:33:05,640
What the fuck?
Joe diaz.

4378
03:33:05,690 --> 03:33:07,280
It's only three and a half hours into 
the show.

4379
03:33:09,690 --> 03:33:12,950
I got to pick the baby up.
Listen,

4380
03:33:13,160 --> 03:33:15,200
this is one of my favorite times ever.
Oh mY god.

4381
03:33:16,010 --> 03:33:18,050
I'm going to have to review it and find 
out what the fuck you said.

4382
03:33:18,051 --> 03:33:20,630
That made me laugh until I literally 
couldn't breathe.

4383
03:33:21,140 --> 03:33:21,710
But,
uh,

4384
03:33:21,740 --> 03:33:23,750
to everybody that's been on the show.
Thank you.

4385
03:33:23,900 --> 03:33:25,460
Thank you to everybody listening.
Thank you.

4386
03:33:25,880 --> 03:33:28,130
Thanks to all everybody from top to 
bottom.

4387
03:33:28,190 --> 03:33:30,470
I love the fuck out of you.
People more to come.

4388
03:33:30,740 --> 03:33:31,280
