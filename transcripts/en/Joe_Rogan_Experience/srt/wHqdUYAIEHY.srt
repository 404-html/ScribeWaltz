1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,730
The Joe Rogan experience from is taking
the adderall,

2
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:04,620
but uh,
the dropoff at the end of the day was

3
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:06,330
too much for him.
It was really starting to drive him

4
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,460
crazy because he would feel great
throughout the day and be very

5
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:10,280
productive.
And then he'd have this big dropoff

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,760
that's when you start your drinking
cocktail hour.

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,260
I'm not saying there's anything wrong
with adderall,

8
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:18,660
but I am saying a lot of people that are
getting a lot of shit done or taken

9
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,730
adderall,
just clean out,

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,110
clean out my closets,
which I have never done in my whole

11
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:32,700
fucking life because I can't focus to do
that,

12
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:34,290
you know.
But like I said,

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,293
fuck it.
I'm

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,850
fucking closet.
I'm have shit in there from 25 fucking

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,030
years that I was afraid to throw out.
I counted.

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,040
I had something like 1700 black plain
black shirts.

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,560
Wow.
Fuck.

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,590
I go.
How did you count those all I would have

19
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,490
gave up after the first couple of
hundred because I was gay donating them.

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,960
Wow.
That's incredible.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,840
So,
um,

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,770
I'm not going to do that again.
That's when I,

23
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,390
that was pre adderall behavior.
That was pre adderall.

24
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,570
Adderall made me see,
oh shit,

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,600
I had enough fucking black tee shirts.
So adderall give you clarity

26
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,790
on that because my kids are trying to
get me off at

27
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,540
my fucking kids like that.
I put through Rehab now they're giving

28
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,470
me shit about my fucking adderall.
Tell me.

29
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:35,480
It's like,
no,

30
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,460
it's not like I've never done math
except for,

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,530
you know,
two times I was married to Tom Arnold.

32
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,830
But aside from that,
I've never,

33
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,970
I would never get into math.
I don't think it's nothing like

34
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,030
adderall.
I think they've got it down to where

35
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,820
it's very effective for a lot of people.
I'll tell you one thing,

36
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:57,480
it's real effective because I got the
back and forth of everything.

37
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,510
Two way mirror thing going on all the
time.

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,060
It made me.
I used to bite my nails so bad,

39
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:08,520
you know,
like a down to nothing because my dad,

40
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,050
he did it too.
And uh,

41
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,230
and uh,
but I quit for a long time.

42
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,790
Then I went on adderall and um,
I started biting my nails and then I had

43
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,020
to keep it down to only two nails that I
could buy.

44
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,040
I allow myself to bite only tune,
but it perfected my fucking nail biting

45
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:31,580
too,
because there's like no nail left at all

46
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,880
and all so good at it now.
But you give yourself two nails.

47
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,410
Do you have specific nails?
Yeah,

48
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:38,940
these two are my binders.

49
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,680
So adderall let you save your other
eight fingers essentially,

50
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,200
but it kind of forced me to do these to
them.

51
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,870
So it's got its good and bad,
but I have clean closets and you know

52
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,920
what else I
learned it from to write scripts.

53
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,720
I was able to find a fucking focus.
Yeah,

54
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,160
I think there's a lot of things going
on.

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,650
There's a lot of things going on in this
life and um,

56
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,300
I think we should acknowledge all of
them.

57
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,700
You know,
we should acknowledge the,

58
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,350
most importantly,
the mystery of it all.

59
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,470
That's one of the big things that drives
me crazy about someone when they say,

60
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,330
you know,
that this is this and that.

61
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,530
Is that in the,
you know,

62
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:23,640
the way you should live is this and the
way the government should do is that and

63
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:27,310
the way we're going to solve this is by
that like maybe not.

64
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,010
Maybe not like are you,
are you really so sure that you're

65
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,630
paying attention to what the fuck is
going on?

66
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,790
We're flying through space like we're in
a spaceship spaceship was 100 feet wide.

67
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,590
You'd be freaking the fuck out right
now.

68
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,140
The only reason why you're not freaking
out,

69
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:42,250
it's because it's like thousands of
miles wide,

70
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,280
but it's still a spaceship.
You're on this spinning fucking thing

71
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,290
and at nighttime you could see the space
you're flying through and you're

72
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,470
spinning a thousand miles an hour in a
circle and you're floating around this

73
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:56,650
giant nuclear explosion and that's
around other bigger rocks that are

74
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:01,651
flying behind you and gas giants and
then other galaxies and other universe

75
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:05,950
and an on and on and on and you just
hurdling through it while you're worried

76
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:10,120
about what's on TV and why the walking
dead has so many commercials and why gas

77
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:13,030
is $4.
And if you imagine,

78
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,890
if this was the,
let's say,

79
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,700
put yourself in a position where this
really was a dream and you had a lucid

80
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,880
dream where you're aware,
is that what you would want to do with

81
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:22,360
your dream?

82
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,720
If you're going to sleep at night and
you were saying you would worry about

83
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,720
all of these inane things.
Never actually be in the present moment.

84
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:31,150
Never taken adventure,
never go on a risk,

85
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,480
never love because you could get hurt.
No.

86
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,230
If you,
if this,

87
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,340
if you really did treat this like a
dream,

88
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,980
you would do as much cool shit as
possible,

89
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,050
you know,
put his,

90
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:44,920
put as many good things into that dream
as you possibly could and not not be so

91
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:47,800
fucking stressed out about all this
nonsense.

92
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,251
You know?
And,

93
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:51,520
and I think we've been talking a lot,
it's kinda been the theme of this

94
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,860
podcast,
but if you actually did,

95
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,960
if this was a lucid dream,
you know,

96
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,200
you would live it in a different way.
You would live it to have some fun and

97
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:00,700
enjoy.
What can I fly?

98
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,240
Because all my lucid dreams I want to
fly or breathe under water.

99
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,760
Breathe under water is cool too.
That's a good one.

100
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,240
Yeah.
It would be very strange if one day it

101
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:11,320
was.
It was proven that we are really living

102
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:15,850
in some sort of self created reality.
It would be like really traumatizing for

103
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:17,910
a lot of people that have fucked it up
and be like,

104
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,930
this is what I made.
But it's like remember when you were in

105
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:22,780
school and like there was a project and
you had to use your hand and make a

106
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:27,130
Turkey and you put your hand down and
drew around and then everybody did their

107
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:29,840
own little Turkey painted it and then
the teacher would put them up and they

108
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:32,110
would all look at them.
Some people's Turkeys looked like dog

109
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,100
shit.
It looked.

110
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:34,870
I didn't know what the fuck a Turkey
looked like.

111
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,000
They didn't even know how to draw around
their hand.

112
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,410
Like everything was a disaster.

113
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,080
And other people that beautiful turkeys.
Well,

114
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,770
your life is a work of art.
Your life is like a hand Turkey that you

115
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:46,590
make in grade school.
It's.

116
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,190
You could do whatever you want with that
thing.

117
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,330
You can make it super dope.
You know you can.

118
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,020
You can make it so it looks really cool
if you put the effort and time into it,

119
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:57,590
if you really focus on it or you could
just half ass that motherfucker draw a

120
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,990
bunch of squiggly things.
Don't look anything like fingers.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,790
Some eyeballs are floating above his
stupid fake Turkey head and everybody's

122
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,110
like,
what the fuck's wrong with bob?

123
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,950
Fantastic.
I think one of the.

124
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,690
One of the coolest pieces that I've
seen,

125
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,900
and I have to go to the bathroom,
so I don't know if you want to play,

126
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,640
but it's Alan.
It's called Alan Watts.

127
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:20,240
Inception is the name of the video on
Google and that's a great video.
