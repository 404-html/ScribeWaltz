1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,470
The stars have aligned.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,180
The prophecy has come true.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,420
Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo
together on episode nine one one.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,660
So imagine thousands of emails
come out with them talking about,

6
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:16,860
we'll have the kids ready.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,551
Six,

8
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,580
seven and eight in the hot tub
at this time and there'd be,

9
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,690
I don't see anything like that.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:21,901
Oh,

11
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:22,301
it gets you.

12
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:22,890
It gets really great.

13
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,050
Where did it say that it was Jim's emails?

14
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,550
There's fricking thousands of them,

15
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,270
but it said,

16
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,070
we'll get the kids in the hot tub.

17
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,990
I never saw that.

18
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,350
Can you,

19
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,580
can you see if you could find that Jamie?

20
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,320
That seems like we are.

21
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,730
You have to be real careful in how you
describe these things in high talk about

22
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:42,960
these things because people were looking
for any little tiny thing to discredit

23
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:43,160
it.

24
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,400
Say,

25
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,660
I always wondered how
they're getting away with it.

26
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,560
It's so out in the open.

27
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:50,130
How come there isn't more of a psychic
vampires stealing the energy from the

28
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:50,490
kids?

29
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,061
Megan Kelly,

30
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:51,541
so pretty.

31
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,890
She can say whatever the fuck she wants.

32
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,360
She looks like an old trainee.

33
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,223
I love her.

34
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,090
Do you think she looks like an old tranny?

35
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,193
You're hilarious.

36
00:00:59,360 --> 00:00:59,640
No,

37
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,540
I don't like old trainings,

38
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,374
but I think she's hot.

39
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,260
You don't like,

40
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,640
you don't think Meghan
Kelly's not just one.

41
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:04,190
I insulted her.

42
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,023
She's a globalist.

43
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,510
So then site start accusing
me of covering up the,

44
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,050
the Podesta stuff before.

45
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:14,310
It's called pizza gate and then I get
blamed for being behind pizza gate and I'm

46
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:15,120
not even bitching.

47
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,910
I'm explaining what it's like to really
be trying to get at the truth and the

48
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,560
people take the fact that it's complex.

49
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,740
She'd be better at this to me jokes,

50
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,690
you know how to put stuff out,

51
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,650
clear and parse it.

52
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,910
I just know all this crap.

53
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:24,521
When you get crazy,

54
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:25,080
you still rent.

55
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,150
People won't listen to me
because I've got too much data.

56
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,350
You imagine what this is like.

57
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,520
I mean it's just,

58
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:30,271
I'm sick of it.

59
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:31,440
I don't know everything that's going on,

60
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,130
but I know this,

61
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,430
I have good CIA people and
FBI and secret service.

62
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:35,970
Okay.

63
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,451
Telling me.

64
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:37,021
Yes Alex.

65
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:37,441
It's worse than,

66
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:37,950
you know,

67
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,611
keep getting him.

68
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:40,860
It's going to come out and it's
starting to come out and say,

69
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:41,430
watch.

70
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,410
When we started arresting
the pedophile networks,

71
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,440
we're going to roll up the Democrats
and the Republicans that are involved.

72
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,510
And that's why Trump
said any speeches at the,

73
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:49,201
at the inaugural.

74
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,490
This is not about parties.

75
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,990
We're taking these people on.

76
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,280
We're bringing God back in.

77
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,850
Even somebody that wasn't very religious
like Trump has gotten religion learning

78
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,620
about this because let
me tell you something,

79
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:02,460
Trump's not a devil worshiper and he loves
God and he's been briefed on all this

80
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,340
and he's going to roll their ass up
so the pedophiles better get ready.

81
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,740
I foxes totally get anyone no matter what.

82
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:08,850
Fuck yeah,

83
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,420
dude.

84
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,253
Come on.

85
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,720
Get one for Eddie Bravo two I did.

86
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,620
Oh was just tobacco.

87
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:13,990
Yes.

88
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,211
Very.

89
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:15,630
It's strong tobacco from Mexico.

90
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:15,901
I guess.

91
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:16,651
I am in California.

92
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,461
This was for medical reason.

93
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:19,620
100% medical reasons and legal.

94
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:20,281
Okay.

95
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:20,911
Buzz Aldrin.

96
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:21,750
I do no buzz Aldrin.

97
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,950
Buzz Aldrin said,

98
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:24,450
I want to come on your show and I and I,

99
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,700
I'm not gonna get into all the heat.

100
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:27,660
I know he lives here in La
and one time I ran into him,

101
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:28,494
but let's leave it at that.

102
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,401
And he said,

103
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:30,270
I want to come on your show.

104
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:30,631
And I said,

105
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:30,871
all right,

106
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:31,704
well come on.

107
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,540
And it's the only interview
he said and he goes,

108
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,880
I'm going to tell you Alex
and your audience alone.

109
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:36,714
He said,

110
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,430
there is an obelisk just like
2001 it's on the moon of Mars,

111
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,450
the moon,

112
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,760
and it's sending a transmission and it's
all real and it's all Egypt and there's

113
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:48,780
aliens and everything else.

114
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,900
The word is they got military
bases on the other side.

115
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,900
Alex was in the fifties what
do you think we got now?

116
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,763
So you think they have no,

117
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,221
wait a minute.

118
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:57,330
They have bases on the moon.

119
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:57,721
Well,

120
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:58,860
I'll never get into all this stuff,

121
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,620
right,

122
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,220
don't do that.

123
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,990
But let's just say it's super advanced.

124
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,300
They sent a bunch of people to
their company and threatened them.

125
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,460
The next week after I heard
him and he laid it out,

126
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:10,750
he said in 1967 we certified
at the Stanford Research
Institute that he was able

127
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:11,950
to control hurricanes,

128
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,420
Korea,

129
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,180
hurricanes,

130
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,140
and steer hurricanes,

131
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,690
all that got black budgeted shutdown.

132
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,020
And then they got into these arrays
where they could use antennas.

133
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:20,891
And out of that,

134
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,120
and Westinghouse came,

135
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,021
came the,

136
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:23,380
uh,

137
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,681
the,

138
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:24,850
the whole heart program.

139
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,290
So in the 60s,

140
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,380
they could create control
and steer or kill hurricanes.

141
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,000
That's why you Google now bill and
Melinda Gates bought all those patents and

142
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:34,331
the quote,

143
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,730
Bill Gates is going to save
the world from bad weather.

144
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,410
Bill Gates wants to stop hurricanes.

145
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:39,244
Google.

146
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:39,761
Hell,

147
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,990
in 2005,

148
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:44,740
the Department of Energy Program for
Aerosol testing was $5 billion a year.

149
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,870
So under us code title 50,

150
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:48,970
Chapter 32 subsection 1,528,

151
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:49,804
paragraph B,

152
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,590
is that true?

153
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,131
You nailed that,

154
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:51,281
right?

155
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:51,610
Yes.

156
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,100
Yes.

157
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,740
We need from Mars under US code.

158
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,360
Do you live on that obelisk?

159
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,190
That was fucking insane.

160
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:58,024
Let me just tell you,

161
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,820
I need to remember the time and last
time the Cheetah fuck this mother fucker

162
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,110
listed under us.

163
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:09,000
Code title finish number
32 1,528 paragraph B.

164
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,990
That's insane.

165
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:11,651
Under that,

166
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,270
say it's slow that Jamie write it up,

167
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,080
but the big secret is once you have
a crystal ball and know the future,

168
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,550
you can add stimuli beforehand and
make decisions that control the future.

169
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,690
And so then it's the end of consciousness
and freewill for individuals as we

170
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:26,230
know.

171
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,140
And a true 2.0 and a very bad way.

172
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,550
Hive mind consciousness with an AI jacked
into everyone knowing our hopes and

173
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:34,300
dreams,

174
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,350
delivering it to us,

175
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:39,670
not in some PKD wire-heads system where
we plug in and give up on consciousness

176
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,960
because of unlimited pleasure,

177
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,050
but because we were already wired
in and absorbed before we knew it.

178
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,270
By giving over our
consciousness to the system,

179
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:50,080
our daily decisions that it was able
to manipulate and control into a larger

180
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:50,710
system.

181
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,880
There's now a human counterstrike taking
place to shut this off before it gets

182
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:58,960
fully into place and to
block these systems and to
try to have an actual debate

183
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:03,670
about where humanity goes and cut off
the pedophiles and psychic vampires that

184
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:08,020
are control of this AI system before
humanities destroy humanity is only

185
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,040
controlled of Ai.

186
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:09,790
How would they get,

187
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,740
how'd the pedophiles
getting controlling the pet,

188
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:14,260
the pedophiles it at whatever level,

189
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,951
the devil,

190
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:15,611
whatever you want to call it,

191
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:18,610
this inner dimensional thing that gives
them advanced Offworld technology.

192
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:21,700
The fallen one that's not of this world
is giving them advanced knowledge.

193
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,990
Top systems have been used
before on other populations.

194
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,340
What that Satan,

195
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,851
but what do you,

196
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:28,720
what are you talking about?

197
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,040
That's what it does was his rant.

198
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,720
I'm not sure we're going
to go back to that.

199
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,980
He's definitely high as fuck.

200
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,140
This is the stuff about buzz Aldrin is
telling him some fucking exactly crazy

201
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:39,220
shit and I'm like,

202
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,450
Oh my God,

203
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:41,830
I'm too fucked up.

204
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,090
You fucked up.

205
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,160
I told you we are going
to get them all dried.

206
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,590
We had to get her mind and there is a
full out war inside the government of guys

207
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:54,400
that like to eat steaks and drink beer
and having women versus a bunch of

208
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:55,510
Potbelly pedophiles.

209
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,733
Whoa.

210
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,390
I don't claim to have all the answers and
I'm not here to boost your Trump cause

211
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:03,470
I'm tied to his wagon.

212
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,490
If I attack Trump,

213
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:05,324
I'd make more money.

214
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,291
This isn't about money.

215
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,124
It's about the truth.

216
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,050
Trump really is trying to cut taxes
and make people successful and wealthy.

217
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,300
He really does care
about the average person,

218
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:16,460
the elite of set up a
plan to enslave people,

219
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,580
to make folks poor and all I'm asking you
to do is get past thinking that you're

220
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,040
part of the establishment or you're
smart because you're anti-Trump.

221
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,870
I'm asking you to actually look at what's
really been going on and understand

222
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:30,561
that Democrats,

223
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,730
Republicans come and go.

224
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:32,241
Some are good,

225
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,074
some are bad.

226
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,920
The whole power structure has been
against Trump for a very serious reason.

227
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,480
Trump is coming after them and really
is attempting to bring down this whole

228
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:43,760
global system and that's when
all hell is breaking loose.

229
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,940
So I just want your viewers and listeners
know I'm not some political hack.

230
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:47,661
Like you said earlier,

231
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,040
I used to be against Bush.

232
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,020
I wish Obama would have been real.

233
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,520
The point is they got to,

234
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:53,510
Obama would Trump,

235
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:54,800
he doesn't give a damn.

236
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,270
They admit they're offering and money,

237
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:56,601
everything.

238
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:57,434
He doesn't listen.

239
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:57,891
He's like,

240
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:59,450
is he in the middle of an awakening?

241
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,290
Yes,

242
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,850
because he could easily have been a
billionaire to me two years ago who?

243
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,800
Who bought all the mainstream shit,

244
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,490
but he was,

245
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,910
it's like they're interdimensionally
connected like why is it always blew?

246
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:11,750
You're a loser,

247
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,700
slap you in the face of
the back of the head.

248
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,331
It's like,

249
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:15,330
how are they so good at?

250
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:17,560
And it's not movie deal.

251
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,130
That was the greatest
thing you've ever said.

252
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,731
No,

253
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,564
I'm serious.

254
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,370
You just invited a door for people going
who you're a loser and then try to slap

255
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:26,110
you in the back of the head.

256
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,160
It's going to happen now.

257
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,340
Started turning our brain is able
to tune into the lowest dimension,

258
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,473
the highest dimension.

259
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,770
Humans are basically really powerful
creatures that can live right close to

260
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:37,604
sons.

261
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,780
They're highly radioactive,

262
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:39,461
nothing else can live.

263
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:42,560
It's close with very short
lives because we're like,

264
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:47,030
hey hive organism that actually lives
second to second in the space time

265
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:47,510
continuum.

266
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,261
It's like a hundred years,

267
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,094
it's a second.

268
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,450
And we transmit our data up to be able
to live next to likely the stargate jump

269
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,110
gates that are,

270
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,943
that are sons.

271
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,740
So because we live so close to the sons,

272
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,230
we only have like
milliseconds to be alive.

273
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,530
So we're actually a hive organism that
keeps transmitting up to the next species

274
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,291
in our,

275
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:06,651
in our,

276
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:07,940
in a hierarchical system,

277
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,140
and then down below us.

278
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,380
So we're alive right now in this continuum
and we're trying to progress and,

279
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,010
and,

280
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,280
and make things better.

281
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,570
And the elites are trying to make sure
that we don't dial into that incredible

282
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:23,300
knowledge we've got as a species.

283
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:28,220
It basically die as a species so that
we're not competitors on the next level as

284
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:30,500
the Bible says of their dimensional plane.

285
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,833
But yeah,

286
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,980
but you don't believe that.

287
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,390
You're just saying
that's what they believe.

288
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:35,931
Oh yes,

289
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:36,441
exactly.

290
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:37,580
I'm not going to believe in anything.

291
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,443
What do you believe?

292
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:38,900
No,

293
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,201
I mean,

294
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:40,970
I believe in research present to you.

295
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:44,970
We will try to do more to speed the
deportation of illegal aliens who were

296
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:49,550
arrested for crimes to better identify
illegal aliens in the work face as

297
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:53,660
recommended by the commission headed
by former congresswoman Barbara Jordan.

298
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,920
We are a nation immigrants,

299
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,770
but we are also a nation of laws.

300
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,590
It is wrong and ultimately self defeat.

301
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,380
Shut the fuck up about it will power.

302
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:03,930
That's not,

303
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,110
no.

304
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,351
Okay.

305
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:04,831
Let's uh,

306
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:05,720
that's about it folks.

307
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,563
Are you kidding?

308
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,410
Everybody take one day.

309
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,430
If I give you full power,

310
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,320
you're going to be in the photo pit
where I think we've hit it's five.

311
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,250
We're going to wrap this up.

312
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:17,701
We got it.

313
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:18,534
We did a good job.

314
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,490
We put together and ask one more question.

315
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:20,820
Go ahead.

316
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,470
One more.

317
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,770
And a super nice guy.

318
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:23,970
He seems like a nice guy.

319
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,360
He worked there like in college right now.

320
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:28,020
Beyond that,

321
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,650
beyond that,

322
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,483
he admitted it.

323
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,330
He's part of the like wimps.

324
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:32,164
CIA.

325
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,890
Real wait a minute.

326
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,780
CIA has a web division a
if you're the aster family.

327
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:40,500
Lucky is,

328
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,190
yeah.

329
