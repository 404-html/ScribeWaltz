1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,800
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,320
We all know there's treatment,

3
00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:06,090
different treatment,

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:06,250
right?

5
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,060
Celebrities,

6
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,271
well,

7
00:00:07,271 --> 00:00:08,620
especially in Scientology,

8
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:09,160
right?

9
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,650
Yeah,

10
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,340
it's highlighted.

11
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,120
It is like nothing you could ever imagine.

12
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,050
It is.

13
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,250
So when people say Tom doesn't leave
because they have information on him or

14
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:19,521
John,

15
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:20,354
that's not the reason.

16
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,960
The amount of power they receive from
this church is like nothing in Hollywood.

17
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,490
It is like nothing.

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,240
There is no reason for them
to leave this environment.

19
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:32,661
Right.

20
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:34,820
So it's super beneficial for
them to be attached to it.

21
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,683
Correct.

22
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,860
He has employees,

23
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:37,850
they work for him.

24
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,950
All these people will take
care of his every need.

25
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,051
Yes.

26
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:44,950
And there's a policy on
how to talk to somebody.

27
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,600
Like you wouldn't say,

28
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,640
I'm like if you said go get me a go
get me a coffee and I wanted this

29
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:52,480
temperature,

30
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,621
there's no,

31
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,431
I can't get it.

32
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:55,780
We're five miles from any,

33
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:55,991
you know,

34
00:00:55,991 --> 00:00:58,540
with 30 there'll be none
of that kind of talk.

35
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,250
Like not any con there's policy about
don't you don't talk back like ever.

36
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,290
You don't step out of line.

37
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,490
You don't give an opinion.

38
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:07,690
You don't make a face.

39
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,800
You don't make a gesture.

40
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:13,801
You don't sigh if you step out of line
in any way you are dealt with by the

41
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:18,220
Church essentially has servants.

42
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,293
Correct.

43
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,553
How many people?

44
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,993
A lot.

45
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:22,930
A lot.

46
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,231
A lot.

47
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:23,681
And by the way,

48
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't begrudge somebody would
have staff like if you can have it,

49
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:27,220
I go do it all day,

50
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:27,850
all night,

51
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,810
do it all day,

52
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:29,644
all night.

53
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,800
But when you believe as a scientologist,

54
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:37,801
you are working for somebody who single
handedly is saving the planet and you

55
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,650
deserve that kind of punishment.

56
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,310
That's something different,

57
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:43,541
baby.

58
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,650
You understand what I'm like that,

59
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,760
that's,

60
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,480
it's an abuse that is not justified,

61
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:54,481
but it is justified because you believe
that you are single handedly saving the

62
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:56,344
planet.

63
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:57,890
Hmm.

64
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,740
Capeesh yeah,

65
00:01:58,741 --> 00:01:58,921
no,

66
00:01:58,921 --> 00:01:59,370
I get it.

67
00:01:59,370 --> 00:01:59,970
I get it.

68
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,540
So,

69
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,373
um,

70
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,120
so he's the main figurehead,

71
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:03,381
right?

72
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:03,660
Right.

73
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,580
He's the main guy like
right up with Miscavige.

74
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:06,000
Right.

75
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,980
And then John Travolta
is somewhere in that,

76
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,230
I think John was given what a,

77
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,073
um,

78
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,590
a designation called [inaudible]
where [inaudible] not,

79
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,960
can't con con.

80
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,410
Yeah.

81
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,080
K.

82
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,080
H.

83
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,080
A.

84
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,080
K.

85
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,080
H.

86
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,080
A.

87
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,080
N.

88
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,090
Gacaca.

89
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,630
Okay.

90
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,440
Okay.

91
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,750
He's given this designation of cocoon,

92
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,860
which there's a policy that basically
says you can kill another human being.

93
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:32,000
If you were conned,

94
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,350
you're going to look the other way.

95
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,190
It was given that he was given that my
l Ron Hubbard don't make me laugh cause

96
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,430
you gonna make me please
don't make me repeat.

97
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,490
Don't let you out.

98
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,550
Sometimes you work on
a car all those years.

99
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,453
First of all,

100
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,300
not very well.

101
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,790
Do you have any takes I ruined
because of guys like Kevin Goes,

102
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,950
don't don't ruin this take.

103
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:51,150
I go,

104
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,370
no,

105
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,330
don't tell him you're
going to do with that.

106
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,290
And then I would ruin it.

107
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,280
I would ruin a gel because he hit me.

108
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,200
He would do some stupid shit with his
hands or something that he never rehearsed

109
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,810
that would make me cry from laughter.

110
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,190
Yes.

111
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,140
And he was really highly inappropriate
and moments that made me Pete almost fee.

112
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:08,830
Yeah.

113
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,250
Okay.

114
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:09,431
Yeah.

115
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:11,080
So he's a lot of kill people.

116
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,440
Yeah.

117
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,660
Just one or are you getting,

118
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,181
I don't know.

119
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:13,510
I don't,

120
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,770
I should look at the policy again.

121
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:15,660
I don't want to us,

122
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,000
we get it.

123
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
But you're supposed to look the other way.

124
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:20,370
So like if somebody said something
wrong to John Travolta Needs Polo,

125
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,850
Samurai sword and cut their head off,

126
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:26,140
you just got to clean up the body
clean up called ethics protection.

127
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,011
Oh,

128
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:27,340
okay.

129
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,760
Yeah.

130
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,610
So everyone would be
responsible for dealing with it,

131
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,473
dealing with it.

132
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,530
Don't just leave the room.

133
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,030
And he would know that you
guys would take care of it.

134
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,421
Correct.

135
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:35,770
And there's also another policy.

136
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:36,281
And by the way,

137
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:36,440
I,

138
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,360
the reason why I say these policies is
because I don't like when people say,

139
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:40,571
Leah,

140
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:41,321
I believe you.

141
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,430
I don't want you to believe me.

142
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,390
I want you to look it up.

143
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:43,870
Right?

144
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,180
I want you to look for yourself
and make your own decisions.

145
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:50,260
So I keep quoting these policies because
I want people to look it up so that

146
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:50,890
they can say,

147
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,760
that's shit's true.

148
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:52,870
She's not talking shit.

149
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,350
You know what I mean?

150
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,183
Right.

151
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,070
There's another policy
called ethics protection.

152
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,630
There's another policy
called the responsibility,

153
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,790
the responsibility of leaders,

154
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,210
which he actually says
exactly what you just said,

155
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,110
that,

156
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,943
uh,

157
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,731
basically,

158
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:07,310
you know,

159
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:07,510
the,

160
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,920
what you got to do to protect a leader,

161
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:09,550
you got to do it.

162
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,390
If you see a body,

163
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,310
then you clean it up and the
leader should never know.
