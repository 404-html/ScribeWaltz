1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
No,

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,350
the Joe Rogan experience

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,013
all day,

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,520
Ladies and Gentlemen,

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,410
International Man of leisure and
the first ever the youngest ever UFC

6
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,130
heavyweight champion,

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,761
Josh Barnett,

8
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:20,990
ladies,

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,540
gentlemen,

10
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,620
I highly stressed.

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,460
They can't take that.

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,271
They can't take that from,

13
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,390
you know what I'm laying
on top of it right now.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,090
Bag of Oreos and,

15
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,130
and my feet propped up on a,

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,240
and a lovely lady.

17
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,960
Unless some Mike Tyson type
character comes around.

18
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:36,794
When did at 20,

19
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,000
you got that shit locked up.

20
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,080
Don't really see that happening.

21
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:40,921
So weird,

22
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:41,131
isn't it?

23
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:42,420
The heavyweight division is weird.

24
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:42,661
Well,

25
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:44,790
ever since a lot of that
drug testing came into play,

26
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,990
you're not going to see an 18 year old
roll up into the UFC at over 200 and some

27
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:54,690
odd pounds and to start
laying into people.

28
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,620
Isn't it possible though,

29
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:59,490
like one of those freak athletes that
would normally make it into the NFL?

30
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,960
It'd be He's got a dad that had been a
martial arts instructor his whole life,

31
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,883
that kind of thing.

32
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,280
Sure.

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,060
I could see it.

34
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:06,930
But then again,

35
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,240
the poll is,

36
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,283
uh,

37
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,820
if you could make it into the NFL,

38
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,321
you're almost,

39
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:14,100
you're okay,

40
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,040
I'm going to take all that
money now and play in the NFL.

41
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,100
And then if I feel like being a fighter,

42
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:20,760
I'll do that.

43
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,510
Right.

44
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,650
Like Hershel Walker did,

45
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,000
like,

46
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,180
like Hershel Walker did.

47
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:24,451
Although,

48
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,430
I mean he is a freak of freak of freaks.

49
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:26,761
I mean,

50
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:27,720
when you look at Herschel,

51
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,170
he shouldn't be in the kind
of shape he is at his age.

52
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,620
Yeah.

53
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,340
And he says he eats like a bowl of soup
and a salad every day and a snickers bar

54
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:35,851
or something.

55
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:36,330
Yeah.

56
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,460
He's got some weird thing
going on too though.

57
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:42,030
He has multiple personality
disorder that's trauma induced.

58
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,110
Maybe one of those personalities eats
while the other one doesn't know about it.

59
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,570
The other one's working out all the time.

60
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,320
And so you're getting all your caloric
needs from one guy and the other guys

61
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,720
doing all the working out
the other dude jerky off.

62
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,843
Uh,

63
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,331
then,

64
00:01:56,331 --> 00:02:00,240
then you have the one dude that does
your taxes could be useful thing.

65
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,490
It would definitely be
useful thing for your mind.

66
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,170
You compartmentalize like that,

67
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:07,140
you could really pretend you don't jerk
off and really pretend that you don't

68
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:10,050
eat and you just have a bowl cell in
the soup and you're fucking superman.

69
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:11,230
I barely even have words.

70
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,173
Wow.

71
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,490
You got fucking white powder all over
your hands and chalk from Olympic lifting,

72
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,193
calluses,

73
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,790
calluses from man.

74
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,110
I don't know what you're talking about,

75
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:22,540
man.

76
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,280
Threatening me.

77
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,970
That's Mike.

78
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,800
A bunch of engine blocks
out in the front yard.

79
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:28,890
I'll overturned Mike lives
this part of my brain.

80
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,493
Mark did it.

81
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:30,811
Yeah,

82
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:31,770
he was unbelievable.

83
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:35,910
He was like 48 or 49 his last fight in
strike force and he just looks like a

84
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:36,930
fucking Greek God.

85
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:37,441
Yeah.

86
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:40,920
That's the kind of guy that I don't
even think science could make be that.

87
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:41,131
Well,

88
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:41,671
and you know what I mean?

89
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:44,580
Like there are guys out there that like a,

90
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,660
I have a buddy Mike O'hearn,

91
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:46,140
right?

92
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,010
He's 40,

93
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,761
I don't know,

94
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:49,470
46 something like that.

95
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,390
And he's a family friend
from way back in the day.

96
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:52,900
He's from uh,

97
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,180
Juanita or Redmond,

98
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,320
Washington originally.

99
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,730
He's friends with my,

100
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,960
my brother in law.

101
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:58,794
He,

102
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,470
everybody,

103
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,010
we all know

104
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,370
him,

105
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,330
know him for a long time,

106
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,910
ridiculous shape.

107
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:05,360
He can get up to monitor,

108
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,840
don't to 85 still fairly lean,

109
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,300
pull 700 pounds off the floor.

110
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,021
He a hundred pounds.

111
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:12,460
It's ridiculous amount of strength.

112
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,680
Then he can go ahead and shred down to
two 44 something because there have two

113
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,360
42 to do some photo shoot.

114
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,010
Mr Olympia a little,

115
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,300
I'm here,

116
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:24,460
I'm here for this uh,

117
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,110
Supplement company or that supplement
company or guests thing here and still in

118
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:30,100
training do,

119
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,120
I dunno,

120
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,540
600 for reps to squatting and
you're just looking at it and go on.

121
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,640
You know,

122
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,820
his whole thing is being a natural
bodybuilder his whole life and he's,

123
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,000
but it's,

124
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,740
I wouldn't,

125
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,370
you couldn't,

126
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,370
there's nothing you could say they
could ever diminish his what he's done

127
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:49,080
because no,

128
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,210
it,

129
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,190
it's just like there's
nobody else out there.

130
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:53,530
I don't care what you shoved in them
and what you didn't shove in them.

131
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,000
You can't be that guy.

132
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,690
Right.

133
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,070
He's just that sick,

134
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,910
strong.

135
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,110
And he still looks like
he's like 30 so you're just,

136
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,150
yeah.

137
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,840
Won The genetic lottery unless you
have some sort of crazy radical genetic

138
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:05,890
engineering down the pipe,

139
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,000
which probably is going to happen,

140
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:08,380
whether it be lifetime maybe.

141
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,753
But yeah,

142
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,810
like there's some dudes,

143
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:12,340
no matter how much steroids they take,

144
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,340
they're just,

145
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,600
you're never going to compete with
some ridiculous freak athlete.

146
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,081
Now,

147
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:22,081
Mike is one of the most genetically
gifted and a hardworking,

148
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:25,090
of course to people I have ever seen.

149
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:28,000
He also has a world record for
running through plate glass windows.

150
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,030
I know that.

151
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,730
I felt like,

152
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:30,881
yeah,

153
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:31,341
no shit.

154
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:33,000
He does right that race.

155
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,800
But I know you win football gear and a
helmet and they line up these plate glass

156
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:42,730
windows and this huge long line,

157
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:43,480
this light like a,

158
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,320
a two two line or three line deal,

159
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,203
Domino's.

160
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,691
No,

161
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:46,751
no,

162
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:46,960
no.

163
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,770
Each one is individually set up
and he smashes through the first,

164
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:51,231
the second.

165
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:52,180
And you need to keeps going,

166
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:52,481
you know,

167
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:53,540
and sometimes you run into them,

168
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,660
it bounces you back and you
just gotta keep driving.

169
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,860
Oh my God.

170
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,360
He's also got a black belt in judo.

171
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,970
Jesus Christ on the American gladiators.

172
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:01,331
He,

173
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:02,050
uh,

174
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,950
he was on battle dome,

175
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,780
Battle Dome,

176
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,643
Battle Dome,

177
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,150
a kind of remember that?

178
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:07,900
Yeah,

179
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,920
it was battle dome again.

180
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,690
Think lower rent,

181
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:11,650
American gladiators.

182
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:13,270
It was meaner and people got hurt more.

183
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,170
That's running.

184
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,950
Everybody had a very
obnoxious or ostentatious,

185
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,110
like very gregarious character,

186
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:20,950
very over the top.

187
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,020
And so he was Mike Odell,

188
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,640
like the perfect Greek God,

189
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,800
although come on,

190
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,710
that's not very Greek.

191
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,270
But uh,

192
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:28,691
but then,

193
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:28,841
uh,

194
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:29,950
you know who also it was on,

195
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:30,850
there was a,

196
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,291
God,

197
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:32,921
I can't remember his name.

198
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:34,270
He played in the NFL.

199
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,710
He's incredibly funny.

200
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,173
Uh,

201
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,223
Terry crews.

202
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,640
Terry crews is on battle dome.

203
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,301
Was He really?

204
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:40,451
Yeah,

205
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:40,960
he was,

206
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,561
I don't remember.

207
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:42,700
And then there was another guy,

208
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,770
Eric Paulson used to train them and
Eric even did the psycho Guy Gimmick,

209
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:48,850
the Hannibal Lecter deal.

210
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,180
And they had an event on there where
you'd have to get a guy off this platform

211
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,253
over the lines.

212
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,730
And Eric used to just murder
everybody in that event.

213
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,160
And then one of our guys who fights,

214
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,230
who is one of our CSW dudes,

215
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:08,060
he actually went on to
battle dome at one point,

216
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:08,470
uh,

217
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,470
j Martinez way back in the day and
he wrecked all the dudes that he saw.

218
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:14,400
Aunt who got,

219
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,640
he got onto the platform
that get the push out.

220
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:16,860
One,

221
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,550
he just fucked him all
up and they were so,

222
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:24,260
they hated him so bad because there was
like another event where it was football

223
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:25,094
ask,

224
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,000
you know,

225
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,720
Terry Cruz and Mike would just practically
take people's heads completely off

226
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:30,171
their body.

227
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:30,530
It was,

228
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,550
it was really bad.

229
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,271
I'm surprised.

230
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:33,560
And when they redid that,

231
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,910
they redid a,

232
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,841
not this one,

233
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:36,590
but the other one.

234
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,423
Gladiators.

235
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,630
Why didn't that take off?

236
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,740
It seems like that would take off.

237
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:41,510
They'd haul Kogan Laila Ali.

238
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,120
Gina Carano was one of the ass kickers.

239
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:47,840
What channel was that though
during the writers strike?

240
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,970
Was it during the writer's strike?

241
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,833
That's what it was.

242
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,600
But it's still a reality show.

243
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:56,330
Like those that seems like it
would be an easy one to do.

244
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:57,130
Like they,

245
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,330
you know that a wipe
out is kind of similar.

246
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,500
But no one kicks your ass.

247
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,150
Right.

248
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,230
And now people love that
American Ninja Warrior.

249
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:03,590
Yeah.

250
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:03,850
Yeah.

251
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,040
That's,

252
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,400
I don't know.

253
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,710
I don't know why I didn't
actually continue as well.

254
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:07,191
I figured,

255
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:07,371
well,

256
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:11,200
you know it has a little bit of distance
in it and two seasons and that shit was

257
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:11,280
it

258
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,113
done?

259
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:12,911
Well,

260
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:15,550
whenever you have like
people that you have hired,

261
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,350
like you hire a Josh Barnett and you,

262
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:20,800
you have to smash some
dude who's competing.

263
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,660
It gets kind of weird.

264
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:23,494
It's like it's not,

265
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,210
not really,

266
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,140
you're not competing
against another person.

267
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:28,950
You competing against a
hired guy who's does not.

268
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:29,500
So the,

269
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,580
if the guy gets hurt,

270
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,160
if someone gets hurt
and like you heard them,

271
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,550
like I could be pretty easy to sue
the company that makes that show.

272
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,270
Like you're an employee.

273
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,021
If you,

274
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:43,930
if you know some dude makes it run at
you and you fucking clothesline him and

275
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:44,764
he's paralyzed,

276
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,150
he have a waivers man.

277
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:48,460
They fight those things
and when you fight them,

278
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:48,910
if a,

279
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,040
if a lawsuit is strong enough,

280
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,420
it's got enough power behind it,

281
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,280
enough legal power behind it.

282
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,350
I wonder if that was it or probably not.

283
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,540
It's probably just writing.

284
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,810
So I think it was just ratings.

285
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,220
I think it was just ratings.

286
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,230
It's interesting when you think about
what guys are capable of like physically

287
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,650
with the maximizing
your genetic potential.

288
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,540
Like there's certain,

289
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,710
there's a certain level that you can't
get past and it's one of the reasons like

290
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,430
when everyone talks about like steroids
and performance enhancing drugs and

291
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,040
what's what's fair and what's not fair.

292
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,590
The hundred one thing
that's 100% not fair.

293
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:24,424
His nature.

294
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,370
That's true.

295
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,190
It not fair at all.

296
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,030
She's a bitch [inaudible] murder,

297
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:28,660
you will

298
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,051
drown,

299
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:32,950
you will set you on fire and
we'll also just let you show up.

300
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,430
You know,

301
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,970
the,

302
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,590
the proverbial gene pool has
been pissed and you know,

303
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,280
get born with stubby fingers or you know,

304
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,070
half a leg like down syndrome like well
good luck because you how that works.

305
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:45,781
Yeah.

306
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:47,040
And if you're an athlete,

307
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,240
no matter what you do,

308
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:49,580
like there's certain guys you just,

309
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,820
you know,

310
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,270
the Hershel Walker's to certain types
of dudes that just are always going to

311
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,650
have that advantage.

312
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,160
What

313
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,730
you do.

314
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,660
Herschel was a fan.

315
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,870
He was a really well versed,

316
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,740
uh,

317
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:01,951
you know,

318
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,390
he had a good career in the NFL,

319
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:08,391
but he never was the guy
more than anyone else.

320
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:08,761
I mean,

321
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:09,210
he had all,

322
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:09,450
he,

323
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,220
he had some years where he,

324
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,600
and you always knew he was solid,

325
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,630
but he never was the top dude.

326
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,501
Really.

327
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:16,981
I didn't know that.

328
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:17,101
No,

329
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:18,660
he was never the number one guy.

330
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:19,770
And often towards,

331
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,820
later on in his career,

332
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:23,790
he was usually the backup guy or the
dude who got brought in for all the,

333
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,090
all purpose yardage or a well,

334
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,620
because Herschel could run
and catch and possibly,

335
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,850
I bet you if you throw the ball to him,

336
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:30,684
he could,

337
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,560
you know,

338
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,940
he could throw a pass down field.

339
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:33,210
Right.

340
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,740
He could probably play defense event.

341
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,820
It's just right.

342
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:40,821
And then they would do those NFL
a off season competition things.

343
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,640
Right.

344
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,200
Or they take all these different players,

345
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,660
uh,

346
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,400
on NBC or something and they would all
compete against each other and little

347
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,230
events,

348
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,870
uh,

349
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,870
throwing the football through through
hoops and through tires and a sumo in the

350
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:55,471
beach,

351
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:55,891
sand,

352
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:56,730
all this different stuff.

353
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:59,940
Right of the network stars
like that kind of thing.

354
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,470
But just for NFL players,

355
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,980
the NFL would do it and Herschel
Walker won every single one of them.

356
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,020
He was delay every time,

357
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,590
but he was not the best running back
in the NFL during his entire career.

358
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,690
He was not the best fullback he would,

359
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,660
but he could play full back
running back quarterback.

360
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,580
He didn't get fucked up either.

361
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,310
It's like Bo Jackson's out there
crushing everybody eating yards up.

362
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,481
Boom.

363
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:28,930
His hip goes out right.

364
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,430
Or a Steve it and taking uh,

365
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,690
interceptions and running them back 90
some yards as a defensive tackle or dnd

366
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,531
and boom,

367
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:38,460
his need gets blown out.

368
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:38,941
You know,

369
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:39,774
stuff like that.

370
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,710
Not Herschel Walker,

371
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,150
he doesn't get hurt.

372
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:42,780
Yeah.

373
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,291
Was Weird,

374
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:43,560
right?

375
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:43,831
Yeah.

376
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:44,161
He's,

377
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:44,911
he's a specimen,

378
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:45,780
but he never was,

379
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:46,171
like I said,

380
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:47,970
he was never the number one guy.

381
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,833
Right.

382
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,880
Did you see that thing
recently about Jeremy Horn?

383
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,890
Jeremy Horn said zero injuries
are 117 fights or something.

384
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,180
That's insane.

385
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:57,991
I have no idea.

386
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,620
He must be made out of fucking
flubber rubber maid or whatever.

387
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:01,771
You know,

388
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:02,940
he just bounces back out.

389
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:03,481
Yeah.

390
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:04,314
They call them gumby.

391
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,610
That's always been his nickname.

392
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,050
Right.

393
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,690
You know,

394
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,350
he just says it just focuses
only on technique and he's
never been a strong guy.

395
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,010
Well,

396
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,760
he,

397
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,280
he's got a point and it's
something that I've stressed a lot,

398
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:14,910
uh,

399
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,910
when we talk about fighting and that
is so many guys have learned how to be

400
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:24,840
stronger and faster with or without
drugs and learn how to defend certain

401
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:25,591
positions and,

402
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:26,100
and,

403
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,000
and hit hard,

404
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,300
but they don't have a full
well rounded skill set.

405
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,860
They've all got these plan A's and no
plan and their plan B sucks and their

406
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,600
plants c isn't even a thing.

407
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,970
And then when they slowed down a step,

408
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,530
they lose a little bit.

409
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,670
They come up across the guy who's either
stronger and faster or just a little

410
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,720
better striker or too,

411
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,640
too good of a,

412
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,740
too good at something that
will just derail their plan a,

413
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,130
they start losing when they start losing,

414
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,040
they just nosedive.

415
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,370
They lose four or five,

416
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:56,110
it's five fights.

417
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,150
These guys that would go out
there and mop these dudes up.

418
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:58,421
Boom,

419
00:11:58,421 --> 00:11:58,751
boom,

420
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,081
boom,

421
00:11:59,081 --> 00:11:59,411
boom,

422
00:11:59,411 --> 00:11:59,741
boom,

423
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:00,011
boom,

424
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:00,844
turns a corner.

425
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,780
They can't sustain a career
because they have no technique.

426
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,030
They do not have the finesse,

427
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,141
the uh,

428
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:08,711
the touch,

429
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:09,544
the feel.

430
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,503
They don't own it.

431
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,130
They never developed it.

432
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,750
They just became really strong,

433
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:14,471
really fast.

434
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:15,280
Hit Hard,

435
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,600
overwhelmed out athlete,

436
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:17,230
their opponent.

437
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,430
What'd you call a front runner?

438
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,960
A yes.

439
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,243
For the most part.

440
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:21,941
And Watch,

441
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:22,151
you know,

442
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:22,321
you,

443
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:23,770
you watch these fights and how you all,

444
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:23,951
man,

445
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,120
this fight's going to be so good.

446
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,880
And then it's whoever's gets out first.

447
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,030
Oh that guy wins whoever's game.

448
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,700
Whoever's plan a starts
first wins a fight.

449
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,210
It's interesting when you look at MMA too,

450
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:40,090
it's so few guys or what
you would call durable.

451
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,020
You know,

452
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,251
it's,

453
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:42,620
it's very difficult to like,

454
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,870
like when you see like Steve Bay meo
chick versus a junior dos Santos.

455
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,081
Sure.

456
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:49,960
If one of those crazy
fucking five round wars,

457
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,140
there's so few guys that can
engage in those kinds of wars and,

458
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,441
and,

459
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:54,741
and,

460
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:55,574
and,

461
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,680
and make it out of there.

462
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:57,140
Okay.

463
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,800
Yeah,

464
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,371
that's true.

465
00:12:58,371 --> 00:12:59,600
And honestly,

466
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,830
especially as a heavyweight,

467
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,813
uh,

468
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,920
with all that power and strength,

469
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,810
you go through that,

470
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,500
what's your next fight going to be like
and your next one and the next one and

471
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,560
how many of those you really
want to get involved in?

472
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:11,941
Yeah.

473
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:15,510
Like when you see a guy like Jr and you
see those wars that he had with Cain and

474
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:15,781
you know,

475
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:17,100
you knowing your,

476
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,320
I mean you've had a long career man.

477
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,500
You knowing like the toll that a
fight like that takes on your body.

478
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,300
Do you see him diminished at all?

479
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:25,750
Do you see him slowed down?

480
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,110
He's

481
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,600
a step.

482
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,433
He's a step slower.

483
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,530
Junior is a step slower.

484
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:30,700
He's not quite as durable.

485
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:33,340
He doesn't react the same way
to getting hit as he used to.

486
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,623
Uh,

487
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:35,801
you know,

488
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:37,200
know and,

489
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,080
and here's the thing,

490
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,760
someone might get on
Twitter after this and go,

491
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:41,320
oh,

492
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,901
Josh Barnett,

493
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:44,080
it says that you're not as
good as you used to be junior.

494
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,471
I was like,

495
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:44,791
no,

496
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,760
that's not an insult.

497
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,210
I'm it.

498
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,560
What it's saying is that you're the,

499
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,820
what do you have been through what you
have done through to yourself and trading

500
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,260
and what your body is and isn't willing
to accept or isn't willing to or is able

501
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:00,094
to do.

502
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,240
Just buying the natural string of how
things went in terms of your career to

503
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:05,074
this point.

504
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,310
This is what it is.

505
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,570
Take what you have now and adapt it.

506
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,370
It's in the end.

507
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:16,300
It's really only it's up to you to to
decide whether or not what you're going to

508
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:17,560
do is going to be successful.

509
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,030
If you could only,

510
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,381
if you,

511
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:23,050
you're so set in your mind that it can
only be done one way then when that way

512
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:23,801
is no longer,

513
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:26,200
what is best for you to do as an athlete.

514
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,930
Prepare to have the
shit kicked out of you.

515
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,093
Now,

516
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,140
if you're willing to adapt,

517
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,920
reapply the things that you've already
done well at some new things in.

518
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,300
Just do them a little differently.

519
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:38,290
Make small changes.

520
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:42,160
Well then now you can go ahead and you
can have 19 years of career instead of

521
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,060
seven,

522
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,720
six,

523
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,553
whatever.

524
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,633
You know what I mean?

525
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,540
That doesn't make,

526
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,021
that doesn't.

527
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:50,500
If you could run out there and double leg
everybody in the beginning but now you

528
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:51,410
can't do that anymore.

529
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:53,390
But instead you were able
to set your double leg up.

530
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,730
Just makes people react,

531
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,060
hit him on the way up or hit him and
then get a body lock and finish that way.

532
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,300
How has that any fucking worse
than what you were doing before?

533
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,200
Just because you didn't do it how you
used to but you're still getting to where

534
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:07,034
you want to be.

535
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,960
To me that's still success.

536
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,890
It's an interesting situation where you
see there's some guys that still have

537
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:15,020
like a single minded pursuit,

538
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,970
single minded skillset,

539
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:18,800
like they just want to wrestle and box.

540
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:19,131
That's it.

541
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:20,360
They never throw leg kicks.

542
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:20,991
They never,

543
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:24,710
and those guys are going to get their
fucking shit pushed in once they come over

544
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:25,000
that,

545
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,240
that,

546
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,330
that magic every line.

547
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,040
You don't know when that's going to be,

548
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,180
but it's going to happen and then
they're going to fucking nosedive.

549
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,050
There are going to be washed up has beens.

550
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,800
So it seems like in this
day and age especially,

551
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:37,634
you kinda like,

552
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:37,971
okay,

553
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,200
like it's certain divisions,

554
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,640
like there's certain divisions like
say if you want to fight flyway,

555
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,100
you better be able to do everything.

556
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:43,640
You know,

557
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,200
mighty mouse is just so God damn good.

558
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:45,951
You don't have to fight that guy.

559
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:47,120
You better be able to do everything.

560
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:47,954
And he's a rarity.

561
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,610
Most guys are not going to be him.

562
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,270
Right.

563
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,170
And I've,

564
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,280
I've known DJ since he was just this
kid up at the gym who is too small to

565
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:59,990
really get any fights in a way
class that he really belongs in.

566
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,393
And uh,

567
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,130
he trained diligently over,

568
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,260
even when he knew he
wasn't going to get fights,

569
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,980
he was in the gym day after day
training and training and training,

570
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:10,491
training,

571
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:11,181
hard training,

572
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:12,470
easy training,

573
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,520
fast training,

574
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:14,660
slow training,

575
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,900
and doing what Matt had told
him that he needed to do.

576
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,600
And that's why he is the way he is now.

577
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,500
Uh,

578
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,580
when I trained under Matt,

579
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,260
I did the same thing.

580
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:25,340
I trained constantly.

581
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:26,840
I trained when Matt wasn't around,

582
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,700
when it was my own free time.

583
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,830
I spent that going over what we,

584
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,030
what was working,

585
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:32,901
what wasn't working,

586
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:33,740
why was this working,

587
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:34,760
why wasn't this working?

588
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,350
How can I make these better,

589
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,523
uh,

590
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,180
shadowboxing,

591
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,991
figuring things out,

592
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:40,270
altering and,

593
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,290
and the things that Matt would say,

594
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,501
well,

595
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,580
I need you to do this.

596
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,360
Ah,

597
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,650
I don't really understand why or
what can you explain it to me?

598
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,220
Well,

599
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,490
because I need you to do
this so that you can do this.

600
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,211
Create,

601
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,230
elicit this reaction,

602
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,093
whatever.

603
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,700
Well,

604
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,570
I still don't get it,

605
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:58,130
but I know what you want,

606
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,290
where this is supposed to lead to.

607
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,760
I'll figure it out.

608
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,970
I will play with it and play with it
and play with it and play with it.

609
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,890
Not talking about my cock,

610
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,620
but in addition to that,

611
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,890
I will keep playing with it
until it makes sense to me.

612
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:18,310
And then I can come back and now I can
ask a question that has purpose to it and

613
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:19,730
instead of just,

614
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,563
I don't get it.

615
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,980
Of course you don't get it.

616
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,180
You're not going to get it.

617
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:23,811
Lots of things.

618
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:27,860
You're just not going to get the first
time until you live in it until you wrap

619
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:28,430
it,

620
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,370
wrap it around you like
a skin and understand it.

621
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,573
Uh,

622
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,280
and then you might even
make a decision to go,

623
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,130
what you want me to accomplish with this.

624
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,550
It isn't that effective
for me to do it this way,

625
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,870
but if I just make a little change
to it because of the way I'm built,

626
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,090
because of my own natural tendencies,

627
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,553
what have you,

628
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,363
I can get that.

629
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,700
I can get what you want and,

630
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,500
and do it,

631
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,260
do what you want and till the
weekend end of that end point,

632
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:56,094
we can get there.

633
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:56,790
And,

634
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,690
but you can't understand that until
you've taken the time to make that thing

635
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:02,010
yours to fully understand it.

636
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:02,940
And there's some things,

637
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:03,770
you know,

638
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,900
something take techniques of Matt that
he's shown me over the years that I can

639
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:09,240
teach others I can't pull off or the shit,

640
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,830
it's just not my move.

641
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,210
I'm not really built for it.

642
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,920
He was built for it in May.

643
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:14,850
He made it work better.

644
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,110
And the same was with Paulson,

645
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:16,321
you know,

646
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:17,190
just sitting there and,

647
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:22,320
and taking all this information in and
understanding and pulses backgrounds even

648
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:23,520
more varied than that.

649
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,780
So he'll come at me and go,

650
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:25,051
okay,

651
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:25,201
Hey,

652
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:25,660
do this.

653
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,100
I'm like,

654
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,710
that's really from left field.

655
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,383
Okay,

656
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,540
but there's a reason I'll figure it out.

657
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,703
I'll figure that out.

658
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,190
Is that one of the more frustrating
things about being an MMA fighter when you

659
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:41,430
tried to talk to people
that don't know fighting is,

660
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,900
there's so much complexity and so much
technique involved and the person on the

661
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:46,411
outside,

662
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:49,560
it seems to be like a brute sport
involving strength and weight.

663
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,300
[inaudible] and it does
involve those things.

664
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:52,990
Uh,

665
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,640
but it's,

666
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,313
what's that?

667
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,260
Aliens.

668
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,570
But it's not take,

669
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,750
oh,

670
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,583
true.

671
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,960
We've had alarm issues
in this fucking building.

672
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,311
I heard,

673
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:04,971
I saw him.

674
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:05,810
I'll try and get in.

675
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,110
I had to fight my way through the front
to the front that you made it through,

676
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,410
dude.

677
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,130
Nah.

678
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:09,830
You know,

679
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,320
a lot of people don't understand how many
different techniques are involved are,

680
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:13,850
and how much,

681
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,830
how many variables are
involved in training.

682
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:21,060
I can't be too angry at the
ignorance of the casual fan.

683
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:27,030
It's not their job to be that first the
fan that that does go that extra mile

684
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:29,590
and learn about the history,

685
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,370
learn about why this technique would
work and who these people are and where

686
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:35,200
they come from and what
this is and what that is.

687
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:39,340
That's awesome and amazing
and I really appreciate that.

688
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,740
I don't begrudge the person that doesn't,

689
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,470
I don't like it when
they say really ignorant,

690
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,000
mean spirited stuff.

691
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,721
You know what I mean?

692
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:50,050
When there,

693
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,510
but that's a different thing altogether.

694
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,530
That's somebody trying to,

695
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:52,710
yeah,

696
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,860
be a dick on purpose to try and cut
somebody else down that that's a whole

697
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,694
different animal,

698
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,380
but just not understanding.

699
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,573
It's okay.

700
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,960
I personally,

701
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:01,980
when I get into something,

702
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:03,390
I do want to fully understand it,

703
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:05,850
but that's just the kind of person that
I don't even mean people that are into

704
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:05,971
it.

705
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,850
I mean the casual person
that is not aware of them.

706
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,091
A,

707
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:09,380
it's,

708
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,120
it's a fascinating thing
that so many people,

709
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,983
yeah,

710
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,853
that person

711
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,753
is,

712
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,820
you know what it could be anything.

713
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,110
And fighting is,

714
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:23,770
while it is something that is available
and exists within every human being,

715
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:24,050
right.

716
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:24,800
Ability to fight,

717
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,270
everybody has the ability to fight.

718
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,670
Never Seen Brian fight.

719
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,573
Obviously.

720
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,541
I didn't say fight.

721
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,760
Well he doesn't even have the ability.

722
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,000
He just starts falling down.

723
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,780
Yeah.

724
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,250
I just tried to kiss you or something.

725
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,510
Just make it really awkward.

726
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,221
Awkward.

727
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:43,130
So you just want to leave it open so
you don't want to punch his tongue.

728
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,300
Hold on.

729
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,180
Just hold on to your belt loops and just,

730
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,153
uh,

731
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,130
off here offers shoes up to you.

732
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,170
You would look really good.

733
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:54,810
And what's been the biggest
change over your career?

734
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:54,961
I mean,

735
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:55,794
cause you,

736
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,060
you've been around for,

737
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:57,601
you know,

738
00:20:57,601 --> 00:21:02,601
I think the first time I saw you
fight was 96 or 97 something.

739
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,140
Something along those lines.

740
00:21:04,141 --> 00:21:04,381
What,

741
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:04,620
what,

742
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,680
what year was super broad when
you fighting Superbowl 99.

743
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,693
99.

744
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,430
That's when it was,

745
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:09,761
yeah,

746
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:11,080
99 was the tournament.

747
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,040
Uh,

748
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,090
2000 was Dan Severn and then
2001 was my first UFC fight.

749
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,070
So what was your first MMA fight?

750
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,300
The first ever MMA fight?

751
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,290
Uh,

752
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,320
my first ever MMA fight was probably,

753
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,140
it was 1997 of January.

754
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,940
I was on winter vacation from
the University of Montana
and I got a call from an

755
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:31,900
old wrestling coach,

756
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:32,830
uh,

757
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,580
if I,

758
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,630
cause he knew I was trading,

759
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:38,590
he knew I was into it and at the time he
was actually doing Matt Hume's website.

760
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,630
And so he goes,

761
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:41,464
hey,

762
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,630
would you be interested in fighting?

763
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,950
Uh,

764
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,750
sure.

765
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,140
All right.

766
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,541
All right.

767
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,120
Woo.

768
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,410
Uh,

769
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,243
Chris Char Nos.

770
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,100
Oh,

771
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,661
that guy's fun.

772
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:50,141
Super Ball,

773
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:50,700
right?

774
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,200
Was like,

775
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,033
yeah,

776
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,323
okay.

777
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,860
Uh,

778
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,960
when I was like an 11 days,

779
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,340
okay,

780
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,821
what do I need?

781
00:21:57,821 --> 00:21:58,121
Where do I,

782
00:21:58,121 --> 00:21:59,020
when do I need to be there?

783
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,963
And I just,

784
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,710
I trained with a,

785
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:04,390
an old training partner of mine,

786
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,680
this Guy Edward Romana Rosa.

787
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,130
We used to do colleague and some
Thai boxing and self defense stuff,

788
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:09,731
knife fighting,

789
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:10,570
all kinds of shit.

790
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:11,230
Right?

791
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,520
But we're all neophytes,

792
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,031
uh,

793
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:13,721
at the time.

794
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:15,430
But we did the best we could.

795
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:18,850
I would run up the hill from
Ballard to Phinney Ridge.

796
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,140
I would meet him.

797
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,180
We would either go to the park and he
would have me do stuff like throw on the

798
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:25,601
bag,

799
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:27,670
the big army duffle full
of gear that we had.

800
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,590
I'd throw that on and I'd hit tie pads
on an incline because it was fucking hard

801
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:33,011
as shit.

802
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:33,311
Right.

803
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,110
So I haven't checked up and I had a crawl,

804
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,130
walk up this hill and kick these pads
and then he would have me do stuff.

805
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:41,050
Like we didn't have mats
and things like that.

806
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:43,150
So I would just be on the carpet.

807
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,010
I just sit there and take a position,

808
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,430
be blindfold me and
just fucking jump on me.

809
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,030
There are many manuals.

810
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:53,890
It fully just jump on me and I'd have to
figure my way out of whatever was going

811
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:54,071
on.

812
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:54,821
I had to feel it.

813
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:55,654
I couldn't,

814
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,410
I couldn't Tabay sloppy.

815
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,530
I had to figure out what was going on
and get to where I needed to be and then

816
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:03,100
finish.

817
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,470
It's like some pink
panther type Shit Dude.

818
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,160
You know,

819
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,090
just jump out at them.

820
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:07,490
Yeah,

821
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,440
just come out of the,

822
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:09,520
out of the closet or whatever.

823
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,230
Kendo stick and taking me out.

824
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,610
I mean it wasn't far from it.

825
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,120
Uh,

826
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,120
but in the end it was about sharpening
the mental aspect of it and just being

827
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:19,060
like,

828
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,893
all right,

829
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,810
you're going to go out there and you're
going to destroy this guy no matter

830
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:23,350
what.

831
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,360
And I choked him
unconscious in two minutes.

832
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,880
What was it was about sort of like
making up the training as you go along,

833
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:33,100
trying to figure it out
and have real MMA gloves.

834
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,620
We had to make 'em out of harbinger,

835
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,130
a bad gloves.

836
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:39,880
We had to cut the bar out of the palm
and cut something else off and there you

837
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:40,180
go.

838
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,810
There's an MMA glove and then
we didn't have real trunks.

839
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,800
We didn't have,

840
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,831
I didn't have anything.

841
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:46,431
I mean there was no,

842
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:47,390
imma make gear that you could just,

843
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:49,370
I went to a sporting good store to get,

844
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,030
uh,

845
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,500
some of my other equipment
and they're like,

846
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,880
what do you need this for?

847
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:57,410
Like fighting wha what
are you talking about?

848
00:23:57,411 --> 00:23:58,430
And even most of the time.

849
00:23:58,431 --> 00:23:59,340
So my first one,

850
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:00,111
it was 97.

851
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:05,111
Then I would fight guys
whenever I could on mats here,

852
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:05,481
there,

853
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:05,871
whatever.

854
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:06,980
It wasn't like I was Doji Star,

855
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,570
Dojo storming back in college.

856
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:09,404
I would just,

857
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,273
hey,

858
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,780
I see you're doing martial arts.

859
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,861
That's pretty cool.

860
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:13,850
He trained a while.

861
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:14,211
Yeah.

862
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:14,511
What do you,

863
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:14,721
Oh,

864
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,890
I did American Kempo and Da da Da.

865
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,803
That's great.

866
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,141
Uh,

867
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:19,130
what do you think of the UFC?

868
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:19,850
Ever watch that?

869
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,031
Oh,

870
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:21,080
that's fucking bad ass man.

871
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:21,450
I love it.

872
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,190
That's cool.

873
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,950
Awesome.

874
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,783
I want to fight.

875
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,183
What?

876
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,911
We'll just,

877
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:26,151
uh,

878
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:26,984
we'll,

879
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,690
we'll negotiate the rules and uh,

880
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,560
we'll just fight right here.

881
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,993
Uh,

882
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,463
okay.

883
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,260
And it's just back off,

884
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:36,951
you know,

885
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:37,551
no gloves,

886
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:38,070
no nothing.

887
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,240
Like,

888
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,073
let's go.

889
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:39,950
Boom.

890
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,120
I remember picking up this dude from the
east coast and shooting in on a double

891
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:45,990
picking him up sky and him booms,

892
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,390
slamming the shit out of him and we had
this big cargo net and hung down because

893
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:51,380
there was all these,

894
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,633
uh,

895
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,840
full courts basketballers like three or
four full court basketball courts that

896
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:57,390
went,

897
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,223
uh,

898
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:58,730
uh,

899
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,960
perpendicular to this whole thing.

900
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:02,060
So are you're running up
and down on the other side,

901
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,380
cargo nets to keep balls from flying
over into this other and onto the matted

902
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:05,720
area.

903
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,553
And also,

904
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:06,900
uh,

905
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,080
there was a rock climbing wall
and some other little stuff,

906
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:11,540
so to keep the basketball
stuff in the basketball area.

907
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,340
And then there was like a little room
that they had built for a women's workout

908
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:16,670
room.

909
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,960
So there was little cardio machines,

910
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:21,740
a little windows that they could
look out across the mats and onto the

911
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:22,574
basketball courts.

912
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,300
People would stop playing basketball
and hang on the cargo net thing and just

913
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:32,000
cheer and Talk Shit and whatever.

914
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,130
That's mad max beyond Thunderdome.

915
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,343
I mean,

916
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,450
one man,

917
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,610
it wasn't a lot of people,

918
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:38,820
but I remember I skyride,

919
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:40,220
this big old dude slammed him,

920
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,063
wham.

921
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,340
He turns over and I throw my hooks in,

922
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:46,730
I splat and face first on the Mat and
I'm just 12 to six elbowing him in the

923
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:47,960
back until he quits.

924
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:48,681
You know,

925
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:49,640
just stuff like that.

926
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,860
And you know the best was always,

927
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:54,410
you'd see a guy talking to his buddies
about how tough he is hitting the heavy

928
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:56,660
bag downstairs and that would
be the dude I'd always like.

929
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,011
Oh Hey man,

930
00:25:58,011 --> 00:25:59,480
I see you've got some experience.

931
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:02,060
You ever thought before like Oh yeah,

932
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:02,331
sure.

933
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:03,980
Whatever you want to fight.

934
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,060
Uh okay pal out.

935
00:26:07,061 --> 00:26:07,894
Just like

936
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,460
you get your training.

937
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,001
Yeah,

938
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,520
because I had that first
fight and that goes,

939
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,720
that was really cool.

940
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,240
We want you to come back and
fight again in the summer.

941
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,930
And at this point I was just
the dip shit who had showed up.

942
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:22,250
It was like,

943
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,240
who the fuck is this guy?

944
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,220
How old were you back to 1919.

945
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:25,551
In fact,

946
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:29,150
this dude in line is talking to me just
making conversation cause I'm this new

947
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:31,920
face around and Charlotte
was trains at AMC and he's,

948
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,430
and he's already a pro and he'd be,

949
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:35,450
he'd been known.

950
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,780
So I'm just this kid from Montana and
their highs even though I'm from Ballard

951
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,720
and uh,

952
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,401
he's just asking me,

953
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:42,531
well,

954
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:43,170
where do you train?

955
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:43,291
Go?

956
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,000
Well,

957
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,160
you know,

958
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,060
I used to train,

959
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,923
you know,

960
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,720
church basement with this
other dude and whatever,

961
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:50,670
and I train it a Jim Harrison's,

962
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:51,420
uh,

963
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,400
Bushido Ashita conquer Hurghada and,

964
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,323
and uh,

965
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,410
uh,

966
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,071
and Missoula.

967
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:56,670
And there was like,

968
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,503
oh,

969
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,770
okay,

970
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,700
well a cool cause everybody
thinks I'm going to get murdered.

971
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,100
I fucking trained in church basements.

972
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,990
What fucking idiot is this guy?

973
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:08,410
Where did they find this moron?

974
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,290
He's going to get murdered.

975
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,480
Like I can't believe even the guy sitting
next to my mom filming it is cheering

976
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:16,740
for Chris,

977
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,510
kick his ass back to Montana.

978
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,470
And my mom's like,

979
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,730
I'll come on as my son right now.

980
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:20,911
He's like,

981
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:21,181
oh,

982
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:21,631
I know.

983
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:22,230
I'm just,

984
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,740
I'm just,

985
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:22,981
you know,

986
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:24,090
I'm just playing around and you know,

987
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:24,361
Chris,

988
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:25,194
Chris won't hurt him.

989
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,460
What was like your motivation back then?

990
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:29,951
Do you think that,

991
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:32,310
did you think that this is going to
be a career or were you just enjoying

992
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:32,970
yourself?

993
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:33,301
No,

994
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:35,190
I intended fully to,

995
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,850
this was a point there.

996
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,860
I told the people that are trained
with back at Jim Harrison's place,

997
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,570
which is by the way,

998
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,550
that is a put up or shut up,

999
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,200
no bullshit.

1000
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,950
If you come in trying to be a big shot,

1001
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,980
you will get your fucking teeth
knocked out and you don't,

1002
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:56,820
that's not the place to
try and be a tough guy.

1003
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,451
And,

1004
00:27:57,451 --> 00:27:57,840
uh,

1005
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,270
Jim Harrison's is about as
tough and as mean as a come.

1006
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,021
Uh,

1007
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:01,854
he's,

1008
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,450
he's a,

1009
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:02,700
uh,

1010
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,880
was a big help towards me
developing who I am as a fighter.

1011
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,430
It was a first US light
heavyweight kickboxing champion,

1012
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:09,630
and he was a judo champion.

1013
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,660
He fought the bare knuckle
karate back in the day,

1014
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:14,070
like with Chuck Norris and all of them.

1015
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,440
He was a super foot Wallace's trainer.

1016
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,990
This dude is legit.

1017
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,980
And so when we'd get guys that come in
the gym and they'd start doing all this

1018
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:24,240
stuff and acting pretty cocky,

1019
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:25,680
and then we just take turns like,

1020
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:26,160
Hey,

1021
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,020
who's gonna kick the shit
out of this guy tonight?

1022
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,513
So,

1023
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,240
uh,

1024
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,240
so I'm out there a training and I
said to the junior instructor there,

1025
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:35,701
I said,

1026
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:36,534
well,

1027
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:36,901
you know,

1028
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:37,141
hey,

1029
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:41,040
my goal is by the time I'm
24 I want to be in the UFC.

1030
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,590
And that just kind of chuckle and he goes,

1031
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,540
by the time you're 24,

1032
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:46,650
you're going to win the UFC.

1033
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,800
They go,

1034
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,460
fuck you thought there was a career
in this from the very beginning.

1035
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:55,010
I watched the tapes in Japan.

1036
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,440
I saw that you,

1037
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,090
I just thought with this,

1038
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,120
I don't know what kind of
a living one would make.

1039
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,250
I imagine you could
probably sustain yourself,

1040
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,113
but uh,

1041
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,620
I knew that I would get a chance to
see the world and beat up it's people.

1042
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,420
So that was your actual approach
like you from the very beginning,

1043
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,700
the beaten up these guys
and the basketball court,

1044
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:15,840
you were thinking,

1045
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:15,991
well,

1046
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:18,450
this is just training
towards my ultimate goal.

1047
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:19,284
I need to fight.

1048
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:19,981
I all,

1049
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:23,700
these guys are showing up with 250 and
old records and all this crazy shit.

1050
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:24,001
And I'm like,

1051
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:25,380
I don't have to go under 50.

1052
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,570
I better get the I'm way behind.

1053
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,460
I better start fighting people,

1054
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,600
you know,

1055
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,260
what am I going to do when I re I
fight the guy that's got at least,

1056
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:34,710
you know,

1057
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,910
95 fights fun.

1058
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,770
You should really write a
book about all this shit.

1059
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,210
I know you were one of the,

1060
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:40,380
I mean if you really think about it,

1061
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:41,950
you were one of the pioneers

1062
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,461
that there was.

1063
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:47,461
You were around just a few years after
the beginning of the UFC and you know,

1064
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:49,870
you won the UFC title.

1065
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,570
What was that like five years
after you first started fighting?

1066
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,321
Uh,

1067
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:56,350
from 97 at [inaudible] oh
four oh four that you won?

1068
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,303
Yeah.

1069
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,653
Hmm.

1070
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,051
Wow.

1071
00:29:59,051 --> 00:29:59,884
Why did I think it was?

1072
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,250
No,

1073
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:00,700
sorry.

1074
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,510
2002,

1075
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,811
yeah,

1076
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:03,070
2002 because five years,

1077
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,640
cause I wasn't working for the UFC
when you weren't five or six years of

1078
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,110
training with three years
of three years of wrestling,

1079
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:11,950
two years did judo.

1080
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,301
That's pretty crazy,

1081
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:14,110
man.

1082
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:14,560
I was pretty cool.

1083
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,210
I mean if you really
stop and think about it,

1084
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:17,650
that is a really crazy path.

1085
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,000
You really should write a book then.

1086
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,080
We used to go to that.

1087
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,110
I like to be around and worry about all
the people that would get thrown under

1088
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:23,650
the bus.

1089
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,820
Not on purpose.

1090
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,020
Just man.

1091
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:26,950
I've seen some shit.

1092
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,210
I've heard some shit.

1093
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,410
I've been around some shit.

1094
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,320
I prefer to keep that on the DL.

1095
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,470
That brings us to one of the things we
were supposed to talk about on this show

1096
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:36,610
that we need to talk about.

1097
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,300
Um,

1098
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,320
John Wayne Parker was on the show and
John Wayne Parr who is a great guy.

1099
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,280
I love him to death.

1100
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:42,940
Uh,

1101
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,110
I really enjoyed talking to him,

1102
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:47,770
but he had one particular story that
pissed you off and it was a story about

1103
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,880
training with you.

1104
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:49,750
Uh,

1105
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,920
it was before you fought men.

1106
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:52,480
It's Haro in the new year show.

1107
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:52,900
Yeah.

1108
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,070
And um,

1109
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,700
well let's just play it and we'll get
you a reaction to it because I know you

1110
00:30:57,701 --> 00:30:58,900
really want to talk about this.

1111
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,920
He's got a little like catch
wrestling as a few sterndrive.

1112
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,030
Uh,

1113
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,180
it's,

1114
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,030
you want to hear a funny story?

1115
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:04,923
Sure.

1116
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:07,650
Say,

1117
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:07,910
I,

1118
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,330
I,

1119
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,130
um,

1120
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,170
I meet Cub Swanson.

1121
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,400
Cub Swanson is cool dude,

1122
00:31:11,401 --> 00:31:12,450
and they're hanging out.

1123
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,690
And then my first day,

1124
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,310
Eric Paulson,

1125
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,060
steam,

1126
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,893
uh,

1127
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,240
it's more tidy.

1128
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:18,961
Okay.

1129
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:19,351
And I'm the,

1130
00:31:19,351 --> 00:31:20,100
I'm the new guy.

1131
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,933
I have no nothing.

1132
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,990
No one knows who I am.

1133
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:22,970
And then it's like,

1134
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,820
I already post was like,

1135
00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:24,410
okay,

1136
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,070
[inaudible] has put your gear on guys.

1137
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:26,611
Okay.

1138
00:31:26,611 --> 00:31:28,290
So Josh Barnett,

1139
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,130
you spa this way,

1140
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,340
he points to me and,

1141
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,290
uh,

1142
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,930
suddenly start and I'll
moving around inside kick jab,

1143
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,430
and then Josh story,

1144
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:39,590
something I'm like out and,

1145
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:39,751
you know,

1146
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:40,051
I mean,

1147
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:40,221
boom,

1148
00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:40,341
boom,

1149
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:40,620
boom.

1150
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,453
And I'm going again.

1151
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,600
He throws to keep cool.

1152
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,423
And then,

1153
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,893
and then a quick,

1154
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,370
he's a big dude.

1155
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,490
He's a big dude in India
in fearing for my life.

1156
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:50,691
Just,

1157
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:51,524
just tapping a light.

1158
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:52,681
And then,

1159
00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:53,280
uh,

1160
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,210
we do two rounds.

1161
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:55,044
After two rounds,

1162
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,770
he takes his glove off and
he throws it across the room.

1163
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,180
He takes a shim pad off,

1164
00:32:00,181 --> 00:32:01,620
throws it across the room,

1165
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,610
he packs his bag,

1166
00:32:02,611 --> 00:32:02,931
he stole,

1167
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:03,764
stolen is out,

1168
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:04,531
and then,

1169
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:05,280
uh,

1170
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,230
they go on to Tokyo the
next day to find them.

1171
00:32:07,231 --> 00:32:08,250
The New Year's Eve.

1172
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:08,760
Um,

1173
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,593
pride tournament,

1174
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,740
I forget who it was against.

1175
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,053
Um,

1176
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,220
and then a bet a week passes.

1177
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,120
Um,

1178
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,200
Josh loses his flight.

1179
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:20,760
I get a phone call from Eric Paulson
about three or four days later,

1180
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,780
ones once I get back.

1181
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:22,500
And I said,

1182
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,070
oh,

1183
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,251
hey,

1184
00:32:23,251 --> 00:32:23,750
this is Eric.

1185
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,490
Hey going,

1186
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:24,870
um,

1187
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:29,870
I just want to let you know that we
blame you on Joshua's loss because he was

1188
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,430
fine right up until he spied you.

1189
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,360
And then some kid that had never seen
before owned him in the spine and took

1190
00:32:36,361 --> 00:32:37,290
away all his confidence.

1191
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,280
So when he got to Japan,

1192
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:39,114
he was a,

1193
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,980
and no

1194
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,720
way this is a true story.

1195
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:42,141
I kid,

1196
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:42,974
you know,

1197
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,371
well,

1198
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:44,090
first of all,

1199
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:44,990
how ridiculous,

1200
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:47,570
or they to take a guy like you would,

1201
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:48,100
they don't,

1202
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,830
you know,

1203
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,700
I was always just that.

1204
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,920
And you go and the gym and it's like,

1205
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,131
oh,

1206
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:51,271
Yay.

1207
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:51,900
You spot him off.

1208
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,733
You can cut it off there.

1209
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,950
So the,

1210
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,670
the fight that you fought in Japan
for the new year show was the,

1211
00:32:58,671 --> 00:32:59,270
the,

1212
00:32:59,270 --> 00:32:59,570
uh,

1213
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,720
Minotauro Nogueira fight,

1214
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,100
right?

1215
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,431
Which,

1216
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:01,910
uh,

1217
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,421
that was a fight.

1218
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:02,960
What you,

1219
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,520
it was very close fight.

1220
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:06,340
And you actually had a leg lock lock?

1221
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:06,550
No,

1222
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:06,680
no,

1223
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:06,811
no.

1224
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:07,550
That was the,

1225
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,630
the second time I fought him that year.

1226
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,770
And uh,

1227
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,420
it was definitely nasty
front choke on them.

1228
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,190
Then he managed to just barely escape.

1229
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,500
I picked him up and
slammed him on his head.

1230
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:16,920
I,

1231
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,940
I whacked out.

1232
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:18,450
I'm a bit,

1233
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,020
uh,

1234
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,190
up top and down below,

1235
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:20,941
but,

1236
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:21,180
uh,

1237
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,710
he pretty much stalled me out.

1238
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,780
He tried to hold me
down most of the fight.

1239
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:25,770
And uh,

1240
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,480
in the end they gave him the decision,

1241
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,350
in my opinion,

1242
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:29,670
what they wanted was a trilogy.

1243
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,890
So I think it was a bullshit decision.

1244
00:33:31,891 --> 00:33:35,190
But if I don't finish a guy and
that the judges make a shitty call,

1245
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:35,401
oh,

1246
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:36,360
well that's my fault.

1247
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,350
Still not the judges,

1248
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,280
but that's neither here nor there.

1249
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,060
Right in the store.

1250
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,781
Really pissed you off.

1251
00:33:40,781 --> 00:33:41,930
So express yourself well.

1252
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:42,220
Well

1253
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:42,750
first,

1254
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,150
all the,

1255
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,343
you could say,

1256
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:45,780
ah,

1257
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,030
this guy came in and,

1258
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:47,980
and,

1259
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,800
and I even made sure to go back through
my mental rolodex about this because

1260
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:52,490
I'll be honest,

1261
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:57,490
I had a pretty vivid memory about training
with John Wayne Bar because I knew

1262
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:00,020
absolutely who he was.

1263
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:00,854
And when he showed up,

1264
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,240
I know he was not unknown to
all these people at the gym.

1265
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,040
And not to mention Eric Paulson,

1266
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,341
it,

1267
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:10,250
we'll make sure to introduce if
somebody of notoriety came in,

1268
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:11,300
if you showed up right now,

1269
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:11,800
Joe,

1270
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,180
if people had been living in a cave,

1271
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,111
he would talk.

1272
00:34:15,111 --> 00:34:15,860
He would say,

1273
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,810
this is Joe Rogan.

1274
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,631
He did taekwondo,

1275
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:18,171
he did this,

1276
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:19,550
and now you may know he will.

1277
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:23,390
He always makes sure that everybody who
shows up gets their due respect and is

1278
00:34:23,391 --> 00:34:24,860
introduced properly to everybody.

1279
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,113
Uh,

1280
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,650
John Wayne Park,

1281
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:31,040
I watched him fight at the sands
before he came and trained with us.

1282
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,470
I watched him fight Muay Thai.

1283
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,150
I'd seen him fight in white tie
before I knew who his wife was.

1284
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:35,960
Uh,

1285
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,681
Angie Rivera,

1286
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:38,180
I had seen her fight before.

1287
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,000
I,

1288
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,170
I know all about John Wayne par
before he'd ever gotten to our gym.

1289
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,420
And he shows up and I'm going,

1290
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,111
Oh fuck,

1291
00:34:45,111 --> 00:34:46,310
that's so fucking cool.

1292
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,760
And I made a point to come
up to John and tell him,

1293
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,710
I watched your fight at the,

1294
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:52,491
at the sands.

1295
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:53,211
I was there,

1296
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:55,100
I've seen you five to know all about you.

1297
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:00,250
And I deliberately spent time
training with John as much as I could,

1298
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,880
as much as I could.

1299
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,040
So here's the thing,

1300
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,200
John had a MMA fight coming up against,

1301
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,223
uh,

1302
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,060
uh,

1303
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,893
Tony,

1304
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,823
Tony Brunello.

1305
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,360
So he's an RGM to try and
figure out this whole MMA game.

1306
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,790
And I even put extra time into
John trying to help him out,

1307
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:29,720
trying to teach him about defending the
take down and try to be more defensive

1308
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:30,420
as a grappler.

1309
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,310
And you know,

1310
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,120
we all,

1311
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,760
everybody there was really
kind and helpful to him,

1312
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,870
especially myself.

1313
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,600
And I tried to spar with him
as many times as possible.

1314
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:40,470
Why was at the gym,

1315
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,830
because he is such a good fighter,

1316
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,200
but at the same time he's
a lot smaller than me,

1317
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,570
so I'm not trying to win.

1318
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,610
I'm just trying to learn.

1319
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm not trying to take 250 pounds and
kick him and hurt him and bust him up and

1320
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,870
make this a competition
about who's better.

1321
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:58,951
If anything,

1322
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:00,210
I would just play,

1323
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,471
play,

1324
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:00,711
play,

1325
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:00,951
play,

1326
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,010
play and you know his,

1327
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:05,090
his striking is so
unorthodox versus a stand,

1328
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,590
a boxing rhythm and,

1329
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,990
and even what you might consider sometimes
the standard Thai boxing rhythm he

1330
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:12,960
punches on on on weird
timing and where we're at,

1331
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,960
timing signatures and weird rhythms
and his elbows are super high,

1332
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:17,130
which normally people would be like,

1333
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:17,964
that's Shitty,

1334
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,330
but he makes it all work and he's got
a great kick in good reactions and good

1335
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,560
footwork.

1336
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,690
So we played a lot,

1337
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,740
but there was never any
ass kicking on my part.

1338
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:29,430
There was,

1339
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,870
I never chucked my gloves across the
room because this new guy just showed up

1340
00:36:33,871 --> 00:36:34,680
and beat me up.

1341
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,100
It's like,

1342
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,450
that's all fucking bullshit.

1343
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,530
Why do you think you would say that?

1344
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,380
Maybe he's been punched in
the head too many times.

1345
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:43,470
Maybe he sees that as his
opportunity to get some sort of fame.

1346
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:45,420
I guess he's got a documentary out,

1347
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:46,254
which,

1348
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,621
you know,

1349
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,090
I dunno what he's lying about in that,

1350
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,140
but uh,

1351
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,030
clearly this guy is delusional.

1352
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,213
Um,

1353
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,071
and even still,

1354
00:36:53,071 --> 00:36:54,930
there's like that unwritten
rule about training,

1355
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:55,141
right?

1356
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:55,980
You don't talk about it.

1357
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,650
And you know,

1358
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,493
that being said,

1359
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,120
when we did spar,

1360
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:04,050
there was at least there was one time
where I put him on the floor by accident,

1361
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,440
just timed a right middle kick against
his right hand and it just clunked him

1362
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:10,260
right?

1363
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,570
And right in the right
spot down to the floor.

1364
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:16,410
He goes and we laughed because we thought,

1365
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,160
Huh,

1366
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,491
I go,

1367
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:18,540
I didn't throw that hard.

1368
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,201
He goes,

1369
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:19,421
man,

1370
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:19,861
that was just,

1371
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:21,960
that was just a hell a shift
that was really well placed.

1372
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:22,460
And we just,

1373
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:22,861
what we,

1374
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:23,431
what did we do?

1375
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:25,770
We figured out how to repeat
it because we thought,

1376
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,690
Huh,

1377
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,530
if if one could land that kicked,

1378
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:30,210
just write be a great quick,

1379
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,100
it'd be great thing to
have in one's arsenal,

1380
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,910
especially if you're not
even trying to hurt someone.

1381
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,830
They'd get hurt so bad.

1382
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:35,131
The drug.

1383
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:35,341
Well,

1384
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:35,481
and,

1385
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:35,851
and you know,

1386
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:36,684
I got a big,

1387
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,561
big heavy leg,

1388
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:37,831
you know,

1389
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:40,500
so I don't fault him for that.

1390
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:40,831
It's,

1391
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:41,041
no,

1392
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,360
it's not like we're trying to win.

1393
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,230
How many just sparked,

1394
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:43,950
sparked him,

1395
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:44,580
fuck,

1396
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,413
uh,

1397
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,081
six,

1398
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:46,501
seven,

1399
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:46,860
eight,

1400
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,521
eight times,

1401
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:47,881
whatever.

1402
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:48,061
I mean,

1403
00:37:48,061 --> 00:37:50,250
he was there for a good bit
and then he disappeared,

1404
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,070
which I guess he took
off to Thomas Denny's.

1405
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,150
I don't know why,

1406
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,920
but,

1407
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,753
uh,

1408
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,341
you know,

1409
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:58,950
it's not like he was having to
pay to be at CSW at the time,

1410
00:37:59,550 --> 00:37:59,821
but,

1411
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:00,120
uh,

1412
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,331
you know,

1413
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:01,310
when it came to MMA,

1414
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,620
he got murdered on the feed in,

1415
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:05,454
on the ground.

1416
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,380
And not because he's a bad Stryker,

1417
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,410
it's because he didn't
have the rhythm yet.

1418
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:11,930
You know,

1419
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:16,930
a little rhythm of stopping takedowns
there with the tension of the takedown

1420
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,821
distance,

1421
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:18,750
the clinch distance,

1422
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:19,110
which,

1423
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,070
which doesn't end,

1424
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,233
uh,

1425
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:21,691
you know,

1426
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:25,530
all kinds of little things that
change the way you pattern your shots,

1427
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,210
the way you would angle the
way you would foot work.

1428
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,493
Uh,

1429
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,340
so,

1430
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:29,581
you know,

1431
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:32,220
just in a straight Thai
boxing said scenario,

1432
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:33,360
of course he's very relaxed.

1433
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:34,580
But with MMA,

1434
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,980
with everything that comes with it,

1435
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,270
he's not so relaxed,

1436
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,740
which is no fault of his.

1437
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,101
Yeah.

1438
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:44,101
He talked about not pursuing MMA because
he was such an expert in Moitai Thai

1439
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:48,940
and he didn't like the fact that like
when he would do Jujitsu or wrestling or

1440
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:49,390
anything,

1441
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,920
he just was so out of his element.

1442
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,461
He didn't,

1443
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:52,780
didn't like being a beginner again.

1444
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,651
What does that well,

1445
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:53,951
you know,

1446
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:54,784
but that's,

1447
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,590
that's quitting.

1448
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,790
That's what that is.

1449
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,640
He wasn't fucking good at
Moitai to begin with either.

1450
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:01,474
I promise you.

1451
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,021
Right.

1452
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:05,380
But he was by the time you started and
that's hard for people to start over.

1453
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,820
It's like taking a guy who has,

1454
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,743
here's the thing,

1455
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:08,860
he,

1456
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,180
by the time he started MMA,

1457
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,410
he was already good at one thing.

1458
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,110
He got so used to being good at one thing.

1459
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:15,760
He couldn't stand to
be a white belt again.

1460
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,370
Well then it definitely wasn't for you.

1461
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,030
Right.

1462
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,630
And a,

1463
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:24,040
I guess you don't like potentially
learning new languages or a real reading,

1464
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:24,874
new books,

1465
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,630
learning,

1466
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,350
that's fine.

1467
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,130
You can stay in your little hole
and clearly MMA wasn't for him.

1468
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,211
Some people though,

1469
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:33,370
they get a little bit
of success a little bit.

1470
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,910
Obviously he got a large
amount of success and money.

1471
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,110
Do you think he made Thai boxing?

1472
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:38,381
I mean,

1473
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:39,180
very little.

1474
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,850
Exactly.

1475
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:44,850
So he probably thought MMA was going
to be a way to get more notoriety,

1476
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:45,551
more money,

1477
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:46,121
more whatever.

1478
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:49,750
And then when he realized that wasn't
going to happen the way he thought it was,

1479
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,823
he quit.

1480
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,041
Well,

1481
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:54,880
you'll see guys that have really decorated
Moitai careers and they struggle to

1482
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:56,650
make it an MMA serial.

1483
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:59,980
Dia Bata is good example is a guy
who's pretty successful in MMA.

1484
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,940
He was pretty successful
but really good at Moitai.

1485
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,410
Yes.

1486
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:03,971
You know what I mean?

1487
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:05,510
The world champion and Muay Thai and this,

1488
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,270
that transition is,

1489
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,040
is it ain't easy.

1490
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:09,581
If it was easy,

1491
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:10,271
everybody would do it.

1492
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:10,930
That's true.

1493
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,763
And uh,

1494
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,260
but as far as kicking my ass at man has
never kicked my ass and his entire life.

1495
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,980
That's weird.

1496
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,400
And you know what's so weird
is I was a John Wayne Park Fan.

1497
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,120
I meet the guy at my gym and make
a point to not only help him,

1498
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,920
but to train with him,

1499
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:30,910
to learn from him,

1500
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:32,230
to have that experience,

1501
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,490
to be there,

1502
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:34,960
you'd be like,

1503
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,201
Oh,

1504
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:35,381
you know,

1505
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:37,660
when am I going to get a chance to
train with John Wayne par again?

1506
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,060
I wanted to have the both
of you on a podcast next.

1507
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,500
It's going to be some fucking all could
happen is that he's just going to go,

1508
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,041
well,

1509
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:45,281
no,

1510
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:46,360
it happened this way and I'm just like,

1511
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,194
shut the fuck up.

1512
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,030
You know what I mean?

1513
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,900
Knocked me out right now then if
that's what you want to go along with.

1514
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,350
But it's just dumb.

1515
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,221
And a,

1516
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:57,220
and then recently someone dug up the
whole Hector Lombard stuff again.

1517
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:57,480
I'm like,

1518
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:57,780
Oh,

1519
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,613
why?

1520
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,260
And I thought that was done because we
have a mutual friend through the gym and

1521
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:02,650
he says,

1522
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:02,801
Oh,

1523
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:03,101
you know,

1524
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:03,581
Hector,

1525
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:03,911
you see,

1526
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:04,660
sorry.

1527
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,250
Apologize for all the crap before.

1528
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:07,000
And I'm like,

1529
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,541
that's cool.

1530
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:07,901
You know,

1531
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:10,810
we never had a problem
with Hector at CSW really?

1532
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:11,501
And,

1533
00:41:11,501 --> 00:41:11,650
uh,

1534
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,350
even the night that Hector
called me out at Bellator,

1535
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,920
I did the day before weigh ins.

1536
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,030
I'm Hector,

1537
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:19,781
how are you doing man?

1538
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:21,040
I think you're going to do really great,

1539
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:21,320
you know,

1540
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:21,480
blah,

1541
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:21,910
blah.

1542
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,410
Still backing him up.

1543
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,580
And then only to have him say,

1544
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:24,761
oh,

1545
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:25,720
I want to fight this guy.

1546
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:27,190
Like what the fuck man?

1547
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,630
He said down at the Wayne.

1548
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,990
When did say that after he won
his fight at Bella [inaudible],

1549
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:32,843
this is when he was the mill,

1550
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:33,723
the champion it.

1551
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,780
But who do you want to fight next to me?

1552
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:39,350
Like I want off fight Josh Barnett
and what we want to fight me for?

1553
00:41:39,351 --> 00:41:42,230
What the fuck dude come on
and people the wrong way.

1554
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,130
You ruffling feathers.

1555
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:43,964
What are you doing man?

1556
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,571
You know what?

1557
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:45,650
Maybe I will,

1558
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:48,230
I will accept that I ruffle feathers.

1559
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:49,400
I rub people the wrong way.

1560
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,430
I will ruffle feathers,

1561
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:55,100
especially in the case that I
will call things like I see it.

1562
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:58,550
I don't let bullshit slide
and I have absolutely no,

1563
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,770
I do not suffer fools.

1564
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,800
So if you come at me with
a bunch of just ignorant,

1565
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:04,401
stupid,

1566
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:04,821
whatever,

1567
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:06,050
if you built your whole life,

1568
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:10,010
this whole construct around who you
are and what you do based on a lie,

1569
00:42:10,011 --> 00:42:11,680
based on something fall,

1570
00:42:11,681 --> 00:42:12,620
something bullshit.

1571
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:13,700
Some I'm just,

1572
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,750
I'm not going to accept that and I'm not
going to respect you if you don't have

1573
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:18,620
to be the best.

1574
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,000
You could be the worst.

1575
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,470
But if you're an honest person,

1576
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:22,340
you're a real person,

1577
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:24,560
then I don't give a shit that's not,

1578
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,970
I'm not really impressed by people that
can try to portray being something that

1579
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:31,700
they aren't or make themselves
into something that they aren't.

1580
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,600
I'm more interested in the people who
are exactly who they are and that's fine

1581
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,110
and understanding that they
have weaknesses and strengths
and being able to grow

1582
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:43,130
and and be a person of integrity and being
a person that is true to who they are

1583
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,203
and true to me.

1584
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,570
So that will cause a lot
of issues with folks,

1585
00:42:47,571 --> 00:42:50,210
especially the fact is
ideal in entertainment,

1586
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,830
whether it be fighting,

1587
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:53,300
are they acting or anything that I do.

1588
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,440
There's a lot of false bravado.

1589
00:42:55,441 --> 00:42:56,900
A lot of made up,

1590
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,033
uh,

1591
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,023
you know,

1592
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,480
machismo posturing,

1593
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:02,811
right.

1594
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:03,171
So,

1595
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:03,590
Hector,

1596
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,161
the first time,

1597
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:09,161
so he says the reason that we had beef
was because he broke my nose the first

1598
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:11,690
day of sparring and I hated him ever.

1599
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:12,530
I want to,

1600
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,850
I hated him ever since then.

1601
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,550
And that's not fucking true either.

1602
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,040
The first day he ever showed up at CSW,

1603
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:20,330
he'd come up from team quest.

1604
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,560
He wasn't going to train there anymore.

1605
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:22,371
And,

1606
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:23,204
uh,

1607
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,980
I think he still hates Dan Henderson.

1608
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:25,880
Uh,

1609
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,990
why does it hit Dan Henderson?

1610
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,880
I don't know that whatever.

1611
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:29,240
I don't,

1612
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,080
I never asked.

1613
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,770
I just,

1614
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:31,041
Oh,

1615
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:31,380
he,

1616
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:31,821
he sucks,

1617
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:32,120
man.

1618
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,860
He's a Jerky Myeong whatever,

1619
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:34,941
you know,

1620
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:35,220
my,

1621
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,170
I didn't get into it,

1622
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,190
but the first thing he came and sparred
was actually one of the best days we

1623
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:42,560
ever had with sparring
because he got in the ring.

1624
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:44,120
He wasn't trying to murder everybody.

1625
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,050
And uh,

1626
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:45,201
you know,

1627
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:47,870
I fucking hit Victor Rolls Autumn
and took his knee and he's just like,

1628
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:48,471
holy shit,

1629
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:49,071
that's crazy.

1630
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:49,820
How did you do?

1631
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,810
We're all having a good time,

1632
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:52,250
but I'm tapping them out
and taking them down,

1633
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,180
whatever.

1634
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,620
But there's no animosity.

1635
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:55,680
We,

1636
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,190
everybody's training and training and
training and he's always amping it up now.

1637
00:43:58,191 --> 00:44:02,300
And then at some point I show up at
practice late and everyone's on the floor.

1638
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,710
Hecker doesn't have a partner.

1639
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,120
So I just threw my shit on real quick.

1640
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:05,691
No hand wraps,

1641
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:06,141
no nothing.

1642
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:07,040
No one's going hard.

1643
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,960
Like I'm just going to jump
in and start warming up.

1644
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:09,993
All right.

1645
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:10,671
Touch,

1646
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:11,001
touch,

1647
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:11,301
tap,

1648
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:12,134
tap.

1649
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,071
Oh boom.

1650
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:15,040
He throws the biggest
fucking punch he's gotten,

1651
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,010
tries to knock me out,

1652
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,660
starts my nose bleeding.

1653
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:18,591
I'm just going,

1654
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:19,730
what the fuck?

1655
00:44:19,731 --> 00:44:23,630
So then it's all on for like 20 minutes
and I put a giant egg on the side of his

1656
00:44:23,631 --> 00:44:25,130
head and shit and then pause.

1657
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,050
And you basically had a fight.

1658
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,810
It was broad it out and uh,

1659
00:44:28,811 --> 00:44:29,230
with,

1660
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:29,450
you know,

1661
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:30,080
boxing,

1662
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,510
kickboxing and Paula finally called,

1663
00:44:32,511 --> 00:44:34,140
called an nine to it and it's fine.

1664
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:35,400
And then later on,

1665
00:44:35,401 --> 00:44:39,660
at some point he sparring mighty moe
and mighty moe drops him and Paul like,

1666
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:39,931
all right,

1667
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:40,230
all right.

1668
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:40,590
So,

1669
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:41,423
you know,

1670
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,180
lighten it up.

1671
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:42,810
Lighten it up.

1672
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:43,261
Fuck man,

1673
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:43,981
I ain't scared of him.

1674
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,300
I ain't scared and mighty mo was like,

1675
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:45,871
man,

1676
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:46,501
fuck you.

1677
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:47,070
What?

1678
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,390
I don't need this.

1679
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,070
I'm here to help you out.

1680
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,100
I already got x amount
of cars and two houses,

1681
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:53,934
whatever.

1682
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:54,720
You know what?

1683
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,770
I don't need this shit.

1684
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,940
I've already made money.

1685
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,430
You're the one who's down here
trying to crawl up the ranks.

1686
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:00,481
You know,

1687
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:01,290
why you,

1688
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:02,490
what are you going to get out of this?

1689
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,360
And so then things started
getting a little worse here.

1690
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:08,130
He started beating up on civilians,

1691
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,320
which is what I call like
people that are not pros.

1692
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,333
And uh,

1693
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,830
and we would still spar and
things like that here and there.

1694
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:15,540
But I always knew that with Hector,

1695
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:16,680
he was always going to go hard.

1696
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,030
You never had a light?

1697
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,140
Not because he couldn't,

1698
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,153
but he wouldn't.

1699
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:20,731
And you guys,

1700
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:22,770
after you'd gone hard for 20 minutes,

1701
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:24,620
you basically fought
it out for 20 minutes.

1702
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:25,291
I was done with it.

1703
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:25,720
I'd never,

1704
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,553
I wasn't mad at him.

1705
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,490
So you were perfectly fine
with sparring him after that.

1706
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:30,330
He was,

1707
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,360
he made it clear who he
was going to be in the gym.

1708
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,140
Oh,

1709
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:34,651
that's fine.

1710
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:34,891
I mean,

1711
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:36,940
one time we had a,

1712
00:45:36,941 --> 00:45:37,830
a grappling tournament.

1713
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:39,960
I drove him out with me
so we could all hang out,

1714
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:40,980
everyone could be together.

1715
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:41,430
Uh,

1716
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:46,430
he came out to this fight out in palm
desert where we had some guys fighting and

1717
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,371
I mean,

1718
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:47,641
every,

1719
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:49,010
he was a part of everything with,

1720
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,040
with part of the team,

1721
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:53,280
but we knew that he was unstable,

1722
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:54,810
but we knew what to expect.

1723
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:59,370
So Bob Lou beat up on him one time in
the gym because he didn't like him at all

1724
00:45:59,371 --> 00:46:00,270
because he was,

1725
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,450
he would beat up on because Hector
would take liberties of people,

1726
00:46:03,451 --> 00:46:03,810
right.

1727
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:04,210
That he,

1728
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,130
that Babaloo felt like,

1729
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,251
well,

1730
00:46:05,251 --> 00:46:06,084
you shouldn't do that.

1731
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:06,961
And,

1732
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:07,794
uh,

1733
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:08,640
but uh,

1734
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,140
then the last time we sparred,

1735
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,543
uh,

1736
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,550
I get on top of him and I,

1737
00:46:14,551 --> 00:46:15,870
and I'm working him over pretty good,

1738
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:17,130
but I'm not trying to kill the guy.

1739
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,750
And he freaks out and he's like,

1740
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:19,660
oh,

1741
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,071
I'm good.

1742
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:20,380
I'm good.

1743
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:20,631
You know what?

1744
00:46:20,631 --> 00:46:21,121
I'm tired,

1745
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:21,331
man.

1746
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:22,141
Why is like,

1747
00:46:22,141 --> 00:46:22,321
what,

1748
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:26,190
what do you mean you to I do every day
you go hard and try to kill people in the

1749
00:46:26,191 --> 00:46:27,024
one day.

1750
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,470
You don't want to go hard,

1751
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:29,221
you don't say anything,

1752
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:32,100
but everybody just expects
us what's going to be bright.

1753
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:32,970
And so he says,

1754
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:33,121
oh,

1755
00:46:33,121 --> 00:46:34,760
and this one day I got on top of him,

1756
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,180
beat him near within an inch of his life.

1757
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:36,451
And I'm like,

1758
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:37,350
I didn't do that.

1759
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:38,760
I know I didn't do that.

1760
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:39,001
Yeah,

1761
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:39,390
I did.

1762
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:40,890
I pinned him and you know,

1763
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:41,400
I was,

1764
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,530
I was leather and m but
not hurting the guy,

1765
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:43,950
you know,

1766
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:44,783
and uh,

1767
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,000
you know,

1768
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,430
he thought he was going
to die or something.

1769
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:46,621
I'm like,

1770
00:46:46,621 --> 00:46:47,454
I'm not gonna,

1771
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:48,660
I'm not gonna do that to you.

1772
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:49,320
It's just,

1773
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,153
it's just training.

1774
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,263
And uh,

1775
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,730
now it's like this thing again,

1776
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:54,100
it's like,

1777
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:54,720
you know,

1778
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,220
you didn't beat my ass in the gym.

1779
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,960
You're an incredible fighter.

1780
00:46:57,961 --> 00:46:58,410
In fact,

1781
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,660
you're a better fighter
than you even understand.

1782
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:01,650
Hector Lombard,

1783
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,200
if his head was right,

1784
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,510
would be untouchable.

1785
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,550
He is one of the most gifted,

1786
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:09,301
strong,

1787
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:14,130
fast at throw aside the fact that
he just got popped for steroids.

1788
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:15,840
Even with,

1789
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,680
even with it,

1790
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,210
you could,

1791
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,260
you could find him,

1792
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:24,090
his fucking his peers and give them
all the same shit or different shit.

1793
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:24,953
It doesn't matter.

1794
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,510
They're not going to move.

1795
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,590
Have the strength and the speed.

1796
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,590
Like Hector's Hector's unreal.

1797
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,230
Hector's should be undefeated,

1798
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,960
the Hector's a headcase and that's why,

1799
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:35,561
you know,

1800
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:40,210
he'll never fully ascend to the top of
the throne or really keep it if he can

1801
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:45,211
get there because he doesn't understand
what it is that he has and how to use it

1802
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:46,570
best,

1803
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,530
but he is amazing.

1804
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:48,400
Don't get me wrong.

1805
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,050
That dude gnarly.

1806
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:50,441
Yeah.

1807
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:51,460
He's a super athlete.

1808
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,510
There's no doubt about that.

1809
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:54,820
I've never seen anybody
ragdoll Jake shields like that.

1810
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,290
He could judge shields around.

1811
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,570
He could do that to anybody
in his weight division.

1812
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,760
He can he can he now could somebody
have a counter for some something?

1813
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,271
Yeah.

1814
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:05,200
I'm not saying he's,

1815
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:06,430
he's invincible,

1816
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:11,410
but I'm saying that what he possesses
and athleticism and skill sets.

1817
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:12,850
He's actually a good leg lock her too.

1818
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,470
You won't see them necessarily go for it,

1819
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,090
but he is a good leg locker.

1820
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:16,511
Yeah.

1821
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:19,000
There's a video of him in
a grappling tournament.

1822
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,140
Breaks that guy's leg.

1823
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:20,530
Yeah,

1824
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,110
it's loud but a carrot and he's got,

1825
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,690
he's got even more
skills than he displays.

1826
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:26,620
But again,

1827
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:26,980
you know,

1828
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,090
you gotta be able to put it together.

1829
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:32,560
But isn't that part of the beauty of MMA
is that it is this weird thing that you

1830
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:32,890
just,

1831
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:37,780
you can't just be a super athlete
because there's other super athletes too.

1832
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:42,610
You can't just be a technical guy cause
there's other guys that are technical

1833
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:43,240
too.

1834
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,560
There's so many variables.

1835
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:45,423
That's true.

1836
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,580
And you could be the
best athlete out there.

1837
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,150
I know I fought people that were bigger
and stronger than me and faster and I've

1838
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:55,250
beaten them before and it wasn't
because I went and I fought there.

1839
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,040
Their speed with my speed or,

1840
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,440
or use my strength against their strength.

1841
00:48:59,441 --> 00:48:59,651
It was,

1842
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:03,700
I found a way to bypass those things
or to put them in such a way that they

1843
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:08,701
wouldn't even apply strength
or speed it where they should,

1844
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,080
they don't even understand that,

1845
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,760
that it's still available to them.

1846
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,280
It's just that they don't
understand the position.

1847
00:49:15,281 --> 00:49:16,540
They don't understand what's going on.

1848
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:20,320
They don't even realize what
opportunities are there for them.

1849
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:20,831
Well,

1850
00:49:20,831 --> 00:49:24,100
isn't it almost impossible unless
you spend decades in martial arts,

1851
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:28,690
it's all almost impossible to have all
the skills and all the knowledge at your

1852
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:29,261
disposal.

1853
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:29,651
Of course,

1854
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:32,470
it's such a deep pool of
information to draw from.

1855
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,373
It is,

1856
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,730
but you know,

1857
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:39,380
if you want to have the
biggest toolbox out there,

1858
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,140
then you have to spend the time to do it.

1859
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:46,070
When the coaches are done coaching
you and you've left practice,

1860
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,570
how do you spend your time?

1861
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,740
Are you watching video not just on your
opponent but just watching video on

1862
00:49:51,741 --> 00:49:56,741
things for fun or or to beat or two to
take a look at something and break it

1863
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,830
down and make it yours and in
a very highly technical aspect?

1864
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:05,480
Or are you a shadow boxing to make
sure that the work on keeping that jab

1865
00:50:05,481 --> 00:50:05,991
inside?

1866
00:50:05,991 --> 00:50:08,240
Are you thinking about the things
that you've been working on?

1867
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:11,720
Are you thinking about every
mentally drilling like gable says,

1868
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:14,450
are you sitting there going
through shot after shot,

1869
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:15,051
after shot,

1870
00:50:15,051 --> 00:50:17,060
set up after set up after
set up in your head?

1871
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:23,440
Are you having a garbage truck come
through in the signal right now?

1872
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,320
[inaudible] garbage trucks right now that,

1873
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:27,591
what's that?

1874
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:28,250
Is that what

1875
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,210
that was popping in the hood?

1876
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,620
Most of y'all can't even hear that.

1877
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,041
They're up there.

1878
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:31,251
Like,

1879
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:32,380
I got a fucking hot spot,

1880
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:33,243
motherfucker.

1881
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:37,310
Bring me your trash and your
recyclables and check your email.

1882
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,210
If you,

1883
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:39,650
if you were going to start someone,

1884
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:40,390
spam goes.

1885
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:41,180
Yeah,

1886
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:44,960
I know you trained with a bunch of young
fighters now you chain a bunch of young

1887
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:45,710
fighters right now.

1888
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,640
Jessamine Duke,

1889
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,200
uh,

1890
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,110
Marina Shaffir,

1891
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:49,940
Victor Henry show.

1892
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:50,070
Hey,

1893
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:53,270
I'm a moto Coleen Schneider Shana.

1894
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,010
And if you wanted to start it,

1895
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,260
say if you're going to start from scratch,

1896
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:02,090
if you were going to develop a program
and take a athletes that had never fought

1897
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:02,810
before,

1898
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,150
never had any martial arts
experience whatsoever,

1899
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:07,310
and turn them into professional,

1900
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:08,360
mixed martial arts fighters.

1901
00:51:08,361 --> 00:51:09,280
If you had a,

1902
00:51:09,281 --> 00:51:09,510
a,

1903
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:11,060
a curriculum as it were,

1904
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,410
how would you start that off?

1905
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,260
Uh,

1906
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:13,831
first,

1907
00:51:13,831 --> 00:51:14,850
first things first.

1908
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,760
What do you possess up top your brain.

1909
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:18,623
Exactly.

1910
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:23,690
If you don't have the type of
mind that can be that dedicated,

1911
00:51:23,821 --> 00:51:24,930
that obsessive that,

1912
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:25,860
that can,

1913
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,910
that can be easy going and you need to
be easy going and be completely unmovable

1914
00:51:29,911 --> 00:51:30,744
when you need to be.

1915
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:31,111
Yeah.

1916
00:51:31,111 --> 00:51:33,780
That unshaking and unfettered confidence.

1917
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,200
And how would you
develop that in a person?

1918
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,240
Is that something you either
have or you don't have,

1919
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:39,680
or is it something that you could develop?

1920
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,860
You can develop it,

1921
00:51:40,861 --> 00:51:41,370
but it's,

1922
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,110
I truly believe that for the most part,

1923
00:51:43,111 --> 00:51:45,810
it's something that you are
born with the ability to do.

1924
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:46,800
Uh,

1925
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,011
you,

1926
00:51:47,011 --> 00:51:50,940
you give them adversity right off
the bat and you give them struggles.

1927
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,420
You give them things that
will confuse them on purpose.

1928
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,040
And you see,

1929
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:57,240
how do they deal with that?

1930
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:01,500
Do they quit and they fold it in and they
throw a fit about it and they throw a

1931
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:02,340
temper tantrum?

1932
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:03,700
How do you,

1933
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,880
because what you have to do to get
to the end goal is really irrelevant.

1934
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:11,220
Getting to the end goal
is what's important.

1935
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:16,490
So if you had to fucking do coffee
runs for two weeks in a row,

1936
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:20,641
if that was all,

1937
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:20,911
I mean,

1938
00:52:20,911 --> 00:52:21,361
come on.

1939
00:52:21,361 --> 00:52:24,420
What is that in the length of what your
career would be in length of what your

1940
00:52:24,421 --> 00:52:25,060
training would be?

1941
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:25,601
Coffee runs.

1942
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,310
What do you mean?

1943
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,220
When one said,

1944
00:52:27,221 --> 00:52:27,670
hey,

1945
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,110
Josh wants you to go get them coffee.

1946
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:29,500
Yes.

1947
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,790
How the fuck is that
going to help anybody?

1948
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,940
I just made it up because
I've been drinking coffee,

1949
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:34,870
but,

1950
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:35,411
but uh,

1951
00:52:35,411 --> 00:52:36,430
if that was it,

1952
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,330
just to see them,

1953
00:52:37,331 --> 00:52:37,541
you're like,

1954
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:37,780
well,

1955
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,680
I want to go train.

1956
00:52:38,681 --> 00:52:40,210
I want to see what they do.

1957
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:40,541
Well,

1958
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:43,660
don't you think that you're
dealing with people like,

1959
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:43,961
okay,

1960
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:47,740
some people will come to the table with
a certain amount of mental toughness,

1961
00:52:47,741 --> 00:52:49,000
a certain amount of discipline,

1962
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:50,390
a certain amount of,

1963
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:50,651
uh,

1964
00:52:50,651 --> 00:52:53,110
the ability to overcome
adversity and some people won't.

1965
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,780
And you're only going to
take the ones that will,

1966
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,040
is it,

1967
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,680
is it possible to take someone who's
almost essentially a blank slate

1968
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:04,681
athletically and turn them into someone
who could understand what's going on in

1969
00:53:06,461 --> 00:53:07,294
their mind?

1970
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:07,511
Like,

1971
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:09,400
do you believe in like mental training?

1972
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:09,940
Yes,

1973
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:10,880
it is possible.

1974
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:11,641
But again,

1975
00:53:11,641 --> 00:53:14,520
they would have to exhibit
those characteristics.

1976
00:53:14,521 --> 00:53:16,530
Not through an athletic window per se,

1977
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:19,440
but just through a
determination standpoint,

1978
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:20,010
uh,

1979
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:20,843
just through,

1980
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,410
you know,

1981
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:26,640
it's like the reason why pro-wrestling
gyms and back in the day,

1982
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:27,960
or even even currently,

1983
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:28,600
uh,

1984
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:28,990
in,

1985
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:30,330
in Japan especially,

1986
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:32,090
and the lion's den and the,

1987
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,210
they had tryouts.

1988
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,410
I had to go through a tryout.

1989
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,350
I beat to profilers,

1990
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:41,550
my first two fights and I still
had to go through a tryout.

1991
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,290
I still had sparring.

1992
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:44,124
I still had,

1993
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:48,570
I had to have a meeting with the coaches
before I could join AMCs fight team

1994
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:51,060
because just winning,

1995
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:51,331
just,

1996
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:53,130
even being a good fighter wasn't enough.

1997
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,170
They needed to see what
does this guy made of?

1998
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,210
Is He coachable?

1999
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,073
Is He,

2000
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,363
um,

2001
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:04,790
is he have the mental capacity to
be in this environment and excel?

2002
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:06,840
Can he,

2003
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,870
can he be one of those people
that what we instill in him,

2004
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:11,243
we'll stick.

2005
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:11,541
Well,

2006
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:13,010
that was what I was kind of getting to,

2007
00:54:13,011 --> 00:54:16,250
is there a way you could
develop a mental curriculum?

2008
00:54:16,251 --> 00:54:20,150
Because it seems like that is
one of the biggest parts of,

2009
00:54:20,151 --> 00:54:23,180
of competing one of the
biggest parts of succeeding.

2010
00:54:23,181 --> 00:54:25,280
And I'm not tripping over your own Dick.

2011
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:25,551
Right.

2012
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:27,920
Which a lot of people do in
all sorts of things in life.

2013
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,300
You see with standup Comedians,

2014
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:30,800
you see it with musicians,

2015
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:32,000
you see with authors,

2016
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:35,780
there's people that just don't fucking
do the work or they fuck up or they don't

2017
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:38,420
fall through or they
take too much time off.

2018
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:42,560
Or w w the mental aspect of success,

2019
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:42,920
the,

2020
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,870
the idea of finding a goal,

2021
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:49,220
figuring out how to get to that goal and
then avoiding anything that trips you

2022
00:54:49,221 --> 00:54:50,054
up along the way.

2023
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,360
Yeah.

2024
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:51,751
Uh,

2025
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:55,800
I don't know about building a curriculum
that's one size fits all because

2026
00:54:55,801 --> 00:54:56,730
everybody's a little different.

2027
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:57,571
But,

2028
00:54:57,571 --> 00:54:57,811
uh,

2029
00:54:57,811 --> 00:54:58,201
of,

2030
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:00,780
of the difficulties that you,

2031
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,250
that you named are,

2032
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:03,080
uh,

2033
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,830
a failing or,

2034
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:05,360
you know,

2035
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,190
not trying to wear some
of these posey yeah.

2036
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,261
Sometimes it is.

2037
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:14,970
Sometimes it's very tight and small.

2038
00:55:14,971 --> 00:55:16,650
Sometimes you just never
know what you're getting at.

2039
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,360
I met Nikki said in rocky.

2040
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:19,920
Yeah.

2041
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,460
Well,

2042
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,293
here's the thing.

2043
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:22,943
Uh,

2044
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,190
some of those things are okay.

2045
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,460
Failing is okay.

2046
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,170
Failing is okay.

2047
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,190
As long as you learn from it,

2048
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:31,040
it's one of the best motivators ever.

2049
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:35,520
What's not okay is distractions
not doing the work.

2050
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:36,040
Not,

2051
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:41,040
there's a difference between not being
successful because it just isn't learned

2052
00:55:43,231 --> 00:55:43,590
yet.

2053
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,040
Isn't,

2054
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,430
isn't.

2055
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:46,170
You haven't developed the capability yet.

2056
00:55:46,171 --> 00:55:47,730
Maybe you're just not quite strong enough.

2057
00:55:47,731 --> 00:55:48,564
Quite fat.

2058
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,411
Things like that.

2059
00:55:49,411 --> 00:55:54,411
Things that you in time can be
learned and understood and grown from.

2060
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:00,300
And then there's shitting the
bed by not putting the work in,

2061
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,280
by having the wrong attitude,

2062
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,121
by showing up,

2063
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:04,230
trying to win all the time,

2064
00:56:04,231 --> 00:56:05,580
letting your ego get in the way.

2065
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,713
Uh,

2066
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:07,801
things like that.

2067
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:09,670
And that's what you want as a coach as,

2068
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:10,190
okay.

2069
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:13,440
Not even just as a coast was take the
coaching aspect out of it because this

2070
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:17,400
applies to life as someone that's going
to have somebody else apprentice under

2071
00:56:17,401 --> 00:56:22,401
them as somebody that has the ability
to instill knowledge and understanding

2072
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,830
towards something that somebody
else wants to work towards.

2073
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,700
That person who needs to learn this
stuff has to have the right head.

2074
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:33,791
My old coach,

2075
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,720
Billy Robinson said,

2076
00:56:34,721 --> 00:56:36,460
you need to learn how to learn,

2077
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:37,900
and that's a fucking fact.

2078
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,250
And so the coat,

2079
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:44,251
one of the mentors jobs is to try and
help guide this person to teach them how

2080
00:56:44,441 --> 00:56:44,921
to learn.

2081
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:45,970
Because once they learn,

2082
00:56:45,971 --> 00:56:46,271
it's the,

2083
00:56:46,271 --> 00:56:50,290
it's the stupid old analogy of
give a man a fish he'll eat today.

2084
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,460
Teach a man to fish.

2085
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:52,630
He'll eat for a lifetime.

2086
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:54,760
It is fucking that simple.

2087
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,950
When broken down to its smallest pieces,

2088
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,820
you have to learn how to fish
and you learn how to fish.

2089
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,440
It doesn't matter if I tell you,

2090
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,101
okay,

2091
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:06,280
well I want you to use your jab
to score on this guy's chin.

2092
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,470
You will figure out the way you need
to use your jab to score on that guy's

2093
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:12,040
chin.

2094
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,680
You will make the jab that you possessed,

2095
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,380
the most effective jab you have ever known

2096
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,080
because you understand,

2097
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,340
you know how to fish.

2098
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:25,750
You're not sitting there getting pissed
off because you don't like the fact that

2099
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:27,850
you didn't hit him every
time or you didn't.

2100
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,440
You're you're,

2101
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,273
you're,

2102
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,820
you're focusing on the wrong things.

2103
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:33,220
You're too busy trying to win
instead of trying to learn.

2104
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,270
Once you learn,

2105
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,193
you'll win.

2106
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,850
If he tried to win all the time,

2107
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:37,691
you're going to fail.

2108
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:38,950
Eventually does a big,

2109
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,420
that's a big problem in Jujitsu.

2110
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,790
Marcello Garcia talks about that a lot.

2111
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:46,660
He says that you have to open yourself
up and training and you can't worry about

2112
00:57:46,661 --> 00:57:47,290
being tapped.

2113
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:47,830
Nope.

2114
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,240
Being tapped as a part of the game.

2115
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,010
Get tapped and just move on.

2116
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,873
Don't worry about it.

2117
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,410
That's right.

2118
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:55,710
It's what's most important is that you
open up your game and then in open,

2119
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,690
instead of being like super defensive
and never taking any chances trying to

2120
00:57:58,691 --> 00:57:58,990
win,

2121
00:57:58,990 --> 00:57:59,560
you don't,

2122
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,610
you don't learn because you don't,

2123
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:01,450
you don't get tapped.

2124
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,870
But you don't learn Jack Shit and
there's always those guys like a,

2125
00:58:04,871 --> 00:58:05,890
every gym has that.

2126
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:06,131
God.

2127
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:07,330
It's almost impossible to tap.

2128
00:58:07,331 --> 00:58:08,530
It doesn't fucking tap anybody.

2129
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,190
Right.

2130
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:09,731
That's true.

2131
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:10,300
And,

2132
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,500
and what?

2133
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:11,771
Yeah,

2134
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:14,650
that's another thing that as a mentor,

2135
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:16,390
as a coach or whatever
you want to call it,

2136
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:20,700
that you have to look for is not the
person is there's always the person that's

2137
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:21,543
just fresh.

2138
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:22,683
The boat,

2139
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:23,250
you know,

2140
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,400
they just fell off the turnip truck,

2141
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:24,910
whatever.

2142
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:25,743
Just getting into it.

2143
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,633
Turn up trucks,

2144
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:27,370
turn up trucks.

2145
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,130
That's an old one.

2146
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:28,963
That's old school.

2147
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:29,831
Well,

2148
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:30,670
the school is stable.

2149
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,280
I mean there's turnip trucks that go
through those feelings all the time.

2150
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:33,761
Oh,

2151
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:34,970
they're all about condoms over there.

2152
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:41,030
There one turnip truck for the
whole entire state of California.

2153
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:41,750
It's organic.

2154
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,330
It is organic to turn traits.

2155
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:44,323
Gluten free.

2156
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,530
Gluten free turnip.

2157
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,393
Yeah.

2158
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,720
I'm not worried about booting
anymore mean either sugar and gluten,

2159
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,370
but that's what the gluten issue is.

2160
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:55,930
It's not like I'm,

2161
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:00,910
the real issue I believe with
gluten is that gluten is all sugar.

2162
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:02,830
Like when you're not dot gluten,

2163
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,450
but gluten containing products.

2164
00:59:04,451 --> 00:59:05,380
If you have a lot of bread,

2165
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:06,280
if you have a lot of pasta,

2166
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:06,761
a lot of sugar,

2167
00:59:06,761 --> 00:59:08,860
and the real issue is she glycemic carbs.

2168
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:09,760
That's the real issue.

2169
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,840
But it seems to be,

2170
00:59:10,841 --> 00:59:12,700
and I've talked to nutritious
about and they're like,

2171
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:15,970
well some people are more sensitive and
some people are the people that are most

2172
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:16,481
sensitive,

2173
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:17,270
it's usually

2174
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:19,490
cause they're Pachulia
is interacting with,

2175
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:20,550
ah,

2176
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:21,980
yeah,

2177
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,240
sure.

2178
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:22,550
It's,

2179
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:23,060
it's a,

2180
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:23,510
uh,

2181
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:24,000
you know,

2182
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,580
Crystal's and gluten,

2183
00:59:25,581 --> 00:59:26,460
haven't they?

2184
00:59:26,461 --> 00:59:27,560
They are the ones where they're,

2185
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:29,720
the intolerance is
within that combination.

2186
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:30,860
Not the person themselves.

2187
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:31,370
I get it.

2188
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:31,521
Yeah.

2189
00:59:31,521 --> 00:59:32,780
The body's okay with gluten,

2190
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:34,520
but if you have crystals
on it at the same time,

2191
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:35,930
depending on what harmony's,

2192
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:36,764
they're vibrating at,

2193
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,920
that gluten could be an
issue is very important.

2194
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:40,401
But,

2195
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:40,870
uh,

2196
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,020
I knew a girl named harmony.

2197
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:43,303
She annoying.

2198
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,020
Oh my goodness.

2199
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:45,191
Look,

2200
00:59:45,191 --> 00:59:46,024
color was orange.

2201
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,520
It's kind of a purpleish.

2202
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:48,890
But that,

2203
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:49,970
that whole thing,

2204
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,410
that gluten thing is like,

2205
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:52,250
there's some to it.

2206
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:54,590
Like you're not really supposed
to be eating bread all the time.

2207
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,230
You're not really supposed to be
eaten pasta all the time and your body

2208
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,160
somewhat.

2209
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,710
Obviously some people have a harder
time processing all kinds of different

2210
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:01,070
foods.

2211
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:01,821
Everybody's diet.

2212
01:00:01,821 --> 01:00:03,080
It's going to be different to the person,

2213
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:05,840
but the one thing that
will help everybody,

2214
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,130
everybody listening to this,

2215
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:07,581
if you're here,

2216
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:10,610
all this gluten frat is
cut the fucking sugar out.

2217
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,830
Just cut it way back.

2218
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:13,910
Eat Fruit.

2219
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:14,780
If you want some sugar,

2220
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:15,643
have a peach.

2221
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,720
I have a pair.

2222
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,260
It'll make a giant difference.

2223
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,320
Totally getting off top.

2224
01:00:19,321 --> 01:00:19,940
We're digressing,

2225
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:20,180
but,

2226
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,680
but we're not because we
were talking about learning,

2227
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:22,060
right?

2228
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:22,660
Learning true.

2229
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:26,000
And one of the things even about the
whole concept of this gluten stuff,

2230
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:26,320
right?

2231
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,560
And bread and pasta.

2232
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:29,630
How refined is the shit you're eating too?

2233
01:00:29,631 --> 01:00:33,500
Like if you had bread that was almost
as as least refined as possible.

2234
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,930
I mean it's going to be refined to some
degree because you made it into fucking

2235
01:00:35,931 --> 01:00:36,710
bread,

2236
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:38,480
but the least refined as possible,

2237
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:42,500
like sprouted grains is way
different from cheese ball,

2238
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:43,400
white bread,

2239
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:44,780
wonder bread type shit.

2240
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:45,450
Salt,

2241
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:45,880
sugar.

2242
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,590
Yeah,

2243
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:47,241
I'm cheese ball,

2244
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:48,890
white bread and I've been
known to be unhealthy.

2245
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:50,360
You're a little cheesy,

2246
01:00:50,361 --> 01:00:51,140
but it's,

2247
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:51,973
it's amusing.

2248
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,680
I love sprouted bread.

2249
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:55,640
I like like a Zeke,

2250
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:56,900
you'll bread and stuff like that.

2251
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,190
I'm not,

2252
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:59,330
my body doesn't seem to
react to that bad at all,

2253
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,470
but it does tend to burn a
little bit on initial uh,

2254
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:03,621
touch from me.

2255
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:06,800
But that's because I'm just
so unholy and say tonic.

2256
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,910
That's the problem.

2257
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,130
The [inaudible] no,

2258
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,940
it's just like starts glowing hot.

2259
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:12,200
I didn't know you were unholy.

2260
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:13,070
Ensay tenant,

2261
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,480
all of the above.

2262
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:16,310
How long have you been unholy?

2263
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:16,920
Uh,

2264
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,560
I think since the day I was born,

2265
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:21,060
I think when I was born out
of that sign or something.

2266
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:21,290
Or You,

2267
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,910
have you been down since I began to crawl

2268
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:26,480
on the night I was born,

2269
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:27,980
I heard the moon turn of fire red.

2270
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:29,983
But uh,

2271
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:30,711
so you get these,

2272
01:01:30,711 --> 01:01:31,491
these new guys,

2273
01:01:31,491 --> 01:01:36,491
but they're sprouted grain bread and
their beats and you get them to a certain

2274
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:36,801
point.

2275
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:37,634
Right.

2276
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:39,140
And then here's the real trouble.

2277
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,240
They experience some success.

2278
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:45,560
They get to some point of understanding
and of they feel like they know what

2279
01:01:45,561 --> 01:01:47,600
their game is and they
know where they can win.

2280
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,750
Getting that motherfucker
out of that hole,

2281
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:51,980
out of that Shell,

2282
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,640
that's hard and that's unfortunately
where a lot of times you just got to turn

2283
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:56,150
to a guy and be like,

2284
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:56,411
hi,

2285
01:01:56,411 --> 01:01:57,244
I'm done with you.

2286
01:01:57,370 --> 01:01:57,950
That's it.

2287
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,560
You have set your own
limitation at this point.

2288
01:02:00,561 --> 01:02:00,921
You have,

2289
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:04,310
you have created your own roadblocks
and you don't even understand it.

2290
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,530
Sort of like what you were
talking about with John Wayne.

2291
01:02:06,531 --> 01:02:10,430
Par like John Wayne Pard not wanting to
learn how to rappel because he was so

2292
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,660
good at Moitai eatery,

2293
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:15,230
cross the Gulf and become an expert
and didn't want to become a beginner.

2294
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:15,741
Exactly.

2295
01:02:15,741 --> 01:02:20,010
John Wayne Card decided he was going
to be a failure in terms of grappling

2296
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,550
and MMA.

2297
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:25,550
He decided that it wasn't a matter of
whether he could be successful or he are,

2298
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:26,250
you know,

2299
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,480
he could be mildly successful.

2300
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:28,560
Greatly successful,

2301
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:29,693
who knows,

2302
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:32,430
but he decided that he
was going to not be good.

2303
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:33,230
I had this guy,

2304
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:34,063
he wasn't sure.

2305
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:35,870
I had this conversation
with a God wants about,

2306
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:36,031
uh,

2307
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,700
this guy who's an MMA fighter.

2308
01:02:37,701 --> 01:02:38,870
I don't want to name his name,

2309
01:02:38,871 --> 01:02:42,230
but he's a really good kickboxer who gone
into MMA and kept getting tapped out.

2310
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:43,431
And this guy said,

2311
01:02:43,431 --> 01:02:45,260
well he just doesn't have
any talent for Jujitsu.

2312
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,221
And I said,

2313
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:47,000
that's crazy.

2314
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:47,181
I go,

2315
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:49,000
it's not that he doesn't
have any talent for Jujitsu.

2316
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:49,281
I go,

2317
01:02:49,281 --> 01:02:51,680
I'll tell you exactly what
happens because I know those guys,

2318
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,660
they are so good at kickboxing.

2319
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:57,140
They don't want to do Jujitsu cause if
they do Jujitsu or submission wrestling

2320
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:57,980
or whatever the fuck it is,

2321
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:00,440
they're going to get tapped out and
they don't like getting tapped out.

2322
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:03,740
So they spend as little time doing that
as possible and as much time hitting the

2323
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:05,000
pads in the bag,

2324
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:06,320
working on their strengths,

2325
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:07,790
not work on the weaknesses.

2326
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,980
No one likes to feel like
they're failing or you know,

2327
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:11,201
it's,

2328
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:15,600
it's a hard thing for people to do it
to go back to sucking again in some way.

2329
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,020
And I just started training kickboxing,

2330
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:19,950
karate and La.

2331
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:25,370
One of my students show he Yamamoto
is a junior world champion and uh,

2332
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:26,410
you know,

2333
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:27,800
junior world champion [inaudible],

2334
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:31,050
he's taken third and fourth
and the weight category,

2335
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,700
a champion world championships.

2336
01:03:32,701 --> 01:03:37,701
He is also the youngest guy to ever
compete in the world open weight.

2337
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,310
He was like 185 pounds or so at the time,

2338
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,680
19 years old or so.

2339
01:03:43,681 --> 01:03:48,060
And he made it to top 32
top whatever he fought.

2340
01:03:48,061 --> 01:03:50,040
Like Glau they or someone in law,

2341
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:50,880
something like that.

2342
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:51,843
Wow.

2343
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,003
Fucking kid.

2344
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,050
I know.

2345
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,430
Cut Out Day has a lot to offer.

2346
01:03:56,431 --> 01:04:00,090
I know all martial arts have something
to offer and I've always thought that

2347
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:00,780
kill chain was a,

2348
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,820
was a bad ass art and it'd be fun to do.

2349
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:03,930
And so what I do,

2350
01:04:03,931 --> 01:04:04,441
I show up,

2351
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:04,891
guess what?

2352
01:04:04,891 --> 01:04:05,760
I got to be a white belt.

2353
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:07,390
I had to go buy a cut out the [inaudible].

2354
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,011
I had the,

2355
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,950
I have to sit there and sit in the back
of the line with everybody else and be

2356
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:11,401
nobody.

2357
01:04:11,401 --> 01:04:14,340
And that's okay because people go,

2358
01:04:14,341 --> 01:04:15,174
I don't understand.

2359
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,380
How come,

2360
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,200
how come you're here with
a white belt training?

2361
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:23,700
Conte doing forms and because
I like being a white belt,

2362
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:27,780
I like learning and in a way it's kind
of like my yoga because I can throw a

2363
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:28,351
sidekick,

2364
01:04:28,351 --> 01:04:31,270
but if you make me do sidekick
from that with the heels,

2365
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:31,540
tea,

2366
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,120
it's just a different way of doing it.

2367
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:33,691
I don't know.

2368
01:04:33,691 --> 01:04:34,381
These forms,

2369
01:04:34,381 --> 01:04:35,220
I don't know,

2370
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:37,950
some of these positions to
do these sorts of things,

2371
01:04:37,951 --> 01:04:42,000
so it makes my body stretch and adapt
and all I'm doing is getting better,

2372
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:42,751
learning more.

2373
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,660
It doesn't mean that I have to go out
there and Sanchia in with my knees and and

2374
01:04:45,661 --> 01:04:48,360
whatever and give somebody
a karate chop in the neck.

2375
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:49,200
It's but

2376
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,560
so learning new movements.

2377
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:51,040
Yes.

2378
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,240
It's always good to learn new movements.

2379
01:04:52,241 --> 01:04:55,150
You were here once and you were saying
that after you left here you were going

2380
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:56,260
to go train savant.

2381
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:56,950
Yep.

2382
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:57,221
Yeah.

2383
01:04:57,221 --> 01:04:59,050
I've trained savant for
about a couple of years.

2384
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:01,240
I've never done any savant training.

2385
01:05:01,241 --> 01:05:01,880
What does what do it?

2386
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,713
Love it.

2387
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:03,101
Okay.

2388
01:05:03,101 --> 01:05:04,240
Here's the simplest way I can,

2389
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:05,380
I can describe savant,

2390
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,633
uh,

2391
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:12,780
think of [inaudible] as like the western
boxing equivalent of kickboxing gear

2392
01:05:13,751 --> 01:05:14,980
more Floyd Mayweather.

2393
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:15,880
Then you are,

2394
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,201
you know,

2395
01:05:17,201 --> 01:05:17,801
my exam,

2396
01:05:17,801 --> 01:05:18,634
it is

2397
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,960
hitting and getting hit.

2398
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:21,071
The idea of Nevada,

2399
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:22,360
it's a touch and not get touched.

2400
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,930
Lots of footwork using
your lead leg lead hand,

2401
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:27,130
uh,

2402
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:28,300
tons of footwork.

2403
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:30,700
So does not a lot of emphasis on power.

2404
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:31,121
No.

2405
01:05:31,121 --> 01:05:32,760
I mean you develop power and,

2406
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:33,200
and,

2407
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,110
and you have your kill shot opportunities.

2408
01:05:35,111 --> 01:05:38,110
But really it's about being scoring off,

2409
01:05:38,111 --> 01:05:42,580
balancing angling w there's a great
fight Raymond deckers versus Pinocchio.

2410
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:45,840
This Italian Slovak guy and it's fine.

2411
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:46,170
Fine.

2412
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:46,430
Yeah.

2413
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:50,280
If I will check with Jamie and
Christ Pinocchio Beats with vectors.

2414
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,300
Get the fuck you're watching it.

2415
01:05:52,301 --> 01:05:52,631
Wait a minute.

2416
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:52,931
Wait a minute.

2417
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:53,410
Wait a minute.

2418
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:56,740
This dude beat Ramon Dekkers off
savant guy beat Ramon Dekkers.

2419
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:57,420
Yup.

2420
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:57,670
Oh,

2421
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:58,200
five rounds.

2422
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,033
Decker like five.

2423
01:05:59,480 --> 01:05:59,921
No,

2424
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:00,341
he was,

2425
01:06:00,341 --> 01:06:01,174
he was a kid.

2426
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:01,721
No,

2427
01:06:01,721 --> 01:06:03,250
he was at least seven and a half.

2428
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,470
I think John Wayne Parr had just beat
him up really bad and practice and his

2429
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:09,400
confidence was shot.

2430
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,240
So a Pinocchio beats deckers.

2431
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,430
But how he does it is by scoring more,

2432
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,480
but being elusive.

2433
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,650
And you watch the two fighters and
you can see it absolutely different.

2434
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:22,450
This Nokia is a real boy.

2435
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:23,061
So,

2436
01:06:23,061 --> 01:06:23,380
uh,

2437
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:24,910
it's Panofsky oh bro.

2438
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:30,640
You Watch deckers and
deckers is full of power,

2439
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,690
tons of power.

2440
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,010
And when he kicks,

2441
01:06:33,011 --> 01:06:35,560
you can see this just bone
shattering type stuff.

2442
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,880
What year was this?

2443
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:38,890
Early nineties.

2444
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:41,140
Or Ramon was still under the prime.

2445
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:41,441
Oh yeah,

2446
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:41,740
he,

2447
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,110
Ramon was still knocking
out ties over in Thailand.

2448
01:06:44,111 --> 01:06:47,140
But the thing is Pinocchio was
almost never there to get hit.

2449
01:06:47,141 --> 01:06:49,030
And the other thing is when
he's taking these shots,

2450
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,650
he slides and moves with them.

2451
01:06:50,651 --> 01:06:54,340
He always takes the power out of it
and there's quite a few times he kicks

2452
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,950
deckers legs out from underneath
them while he's trying to,

2453
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:58,920
he's trying to wind up on them really,

2454
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:02,320
and tags him with a lot of shots
with up top with the hands.

2455
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,720
This is very interesting.

2456
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,411
And it's not,

2457
01:07:05,411 --> 01:07:08,740
the deckers is worst
fighter than Pinocchio.

2458
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:10,540
Don't turn it into that kind of thing.

2459
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:10,720
You know,

2460
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,260
listeners,

2461
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,300
it's about style right here.

2462
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,440
This is what it came down to.

2463
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:16,930
It was a guy using a
different tactic against,

2464
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:17,470
uh,

2465
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:17,681
you know,

2466
01:07:17,681 --> 01:07:22,681
he's not gonna match power with this
dude who could Raymond and was just a

2467
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:23,944
destroyer.

2468
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:27,130
Too much power kicked
in the Dick Right there.

2469
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,230
Now they're wearing those shoes.

2470
01:07:29,231 --> 01:07:30,200
Why are they wearing the,

2471
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:35,440
some sort of fucking your whatever
European leagues thing about,

2472
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:36,101
you know what I mean?

2473
01:07:36,101 --> 01:07:38,170
This is back in the day when
kickboxing was different,

2474
01:07:38,171 --> 01:07:39,060
everywhere you went in.

2475
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:40,180
This is kickboxing.

2476
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:40,911
There's no clinch.

2477
01:07:40,911 --> 01:07:41,744
There's no clinch,

2478
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:42,221
no claims,

2479
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:42,671
no elbows,

2480
01:07:42,671 --> 01:07:43,504
no knees.

2481
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,740
What do you think about that?

2482
01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:47,050
Like the glory rules
as opposed to full moy?

2483
01:07:47,051 --> 01:07:48,640
Moitai uh,

2484
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:52,750
[inaudible] has a tendency to get boring
as shit when they get in the clinch and

2485
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:55,780
there there's throwing side on the after
side knee and no one's really landing

2486
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:56,321
anything of,

2487
01:07:56,321 --> 01:08:00,610
and they're hanging on each other
and I understand why they want,

2488
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:01,923
uh,

2489
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:02,290
you know,

2490
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:04,900
people to be at that
mid range or long range,

2491
01:08:04,901 --> 01:08:06,100
just tagging each other,

2492
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:07,031
uh,

2493
01:08:07,031 --> 01:08:08,560
because it looks more exciting to the,

2494
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:09,610
to the casual fans.

2495
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,280
I kind of get it from that perspective,

2496
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:14,250
but I don't like it as far as uh,

2497
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,193
a style.

2498
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:19,670
You see that lead leg hook kick
and then invaded his low return,

2499
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:20,870
low kick at the same time.

2500
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:21,733
It was barely a,

2501
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:23,360
it was more like a ax kick.

2502
01:08:23,361 --> 01:08:24,260
It looked like a slap.

2503
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:27,380
I don't foot slap inside low high again,

2504
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,360
and he's just moving a lot constantly.

2505
01:08:29,361 --> 01:08:29,750
And look,

2506
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:32,750
it's just spinning off of his kick
and sliding away as he's kicking.

2507
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,290
Yeah.

2508
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:34,620
Pinocchio also beat,

2509
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,860
uh,

2510
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:37,120
or well,

2511
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,450
you don't want Voss fought,

2512
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:38,980
uh,

2513
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,400
in some matches too in lost.

2514
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:41,870
Wow.

2515
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:44,720
So I mean it's just apply it.

2516
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:45,680
So I love Hook,

2517
01:08:45,681 --> 01:08:46,430
kick to the face.

2518
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:47,420
I love the,

2519
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,560
the distancing,

2520
01:08:48,561 --> 01:08:49,400
the speed.

2521
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:49,840
You know,

2522
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:54,380
one of the things I like to do use if
at all possible on teach to people is

2523
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:55,100
that,

2524
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:55,431
you know,

2525
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:55,551
what,

2526
01:08:55,551 --> 01:08:56,930
how much do you think your leg ways,

2527
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:58,280
oh my 30,

2528
01:08:58,281 --> 01:08:59,000
40 pounds,

2529
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,790
if you just got it up there as
fast and as quick and as con.

2530
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:05,300
And it's to the point as possible if
you score as clean as possible and as

2531
01:09:05,301 --> 01:09:06,134
quick,

2532
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,210
I don't need to throw hard,

2533
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:12,530
I mean forces is a mass
times velocity squared,

2534
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:17,570
so let's work on the velocity squared
and not trying to generate more,

2535
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:18,860
more uh,

2536
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,113
uh,

2537
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,920
strength into that movement.

2538
01:09:21,921 --> 01:09:22,754
But just speed,

2539
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:23,091
right?

2540
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:25,190
So mean or killed kitchen style,

2541
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:26,270
then Muy Thai style.

2542
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:27,030
Well,

2543
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,290
Kilcoyne has a tendency to kick,

2544
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:32,210
try to really kick the baseball
bat to part two at times.

2545
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,470
But with savant,

2546
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,860
I mean if you can even watch some of the
old American kickboxing stuff back in

2547
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:40,130
the day and those guys were so adept at
going from foot to hand to hand to foot

2548
01:09:40,131 --> 01:09:40,964
and foot the hand,

2549
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:43,310
obviously it was tailored to the game.

2550
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,480
But if you thought,

2551
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:45,260
you know,

2552
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,030
just watch a Guy Metzger,

2553
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:47,893
uh,

2554
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:48,170
uh,

2555
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:50,600
what's his Arona they're
out there in this bit,

2556
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:52,760
just a nice little kick lead leg,

2557
01:09:52,761 --> 01:09:56,300
high kick and this whack and all of a
sudden a Rhone is on roller skates and it

2558
01:09:56,301 --> 01:09:57,410
didn't even look like much.

2559
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:57,740
Yeah.

2560
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:02,660
You seeing that sometimes today we
are seeing more of a karate style.

2561
01:10:02,661 --> 01:10:05,770
Like Machida is a perfect
example is no windup.

2562
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:07,940
There's no step before he
throws the back round kick.

2563
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:10,080
Well he just throws it
right from their pedis.

2564
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,000
Does that as well?

2565
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:11,480
Yeah.

2566
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,510
You've seen a lot of guys that are front
kicks taking people out as if that was

2567
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:15,800
never a legit technique.

2568
01:10:15,801 --> 01:10:16,311
You know what I mean?

2569
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:18,060
And there's a bazillion
ways to throw front kick.

2570
01:10:18,061 --> 01:10:18,891
You can throw a tie us to,

2571
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:19,700
I'll push kick.

2572
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,770
You could throw the
taekwondo one where you like.

2573
01:10:21,771 --> 01:10:26,771
Victor Webster has one of the nastiest
push kicks ever and he'll fuck and he's

2574
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,790
out here and he steps in,

2575
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:32,180
he rides into it and then he hits you
right in the hip and makes you sit on the

2576
01:10:32,181 --> 01:10:33,014
floor.

2577
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:33,711
It was like,

2578
01:10:33,711 --> 01:10:34,461
fuck dude,

2579
01:10:34,461 --> 01:10:35,360
that sucks.

2580
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:38,910
He just stomps right through your
hip and then you've got cut out.

2581
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:39,441
They style,

2582
01:10:39,441 --> 01:10:43,490
we pick it up and fold it and then punt
as Jim Harrison would say with the ball

2583
01:10:43,491 --> 01:10:45,710
of the foot and you get
them right in the chin,

2584
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:46,910
the solar plexus,

2585
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:47,960
diaphragm area.

2586
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:50,390
You could turn it over like
Savannah likes to do and,

2587
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:52,070
or even Kilcoyne has it too.

2588
01:10:52,071 --> 01:10:52,904
That's a,

2589
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:54,640
uh,

2590
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:55,401
Kiko knows,

2591
01:10:55,401 --> 01:11:00,290
kick the McCaw Zwicky Gary and punt
it right into the liver and it's,

2592
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:00,650
you know,

2593
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:01,281
ball of the foot.

2594
01:11:01,281 --> 01:11:02,780
How much surface area is that?

2595
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:03,620
It's just a,

2596
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:04,520
the end of the Hammer,

2597
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,260
the head of the hammer
hitting right into the point.

2598
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:09,950
And then there's a lot of
old school taekwondo guys
that would throw round kicks

2599
01:11:09,951 --> 01:11:10,131
butt.

2600
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:13,070
They would throw it and land the
ball of the foot like a front kick.

2601
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:13,740
Sure.

2602
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:14,010
That was

2603
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,500
a big thing that used
to do back in the day.

2604
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:16,900
Kicked it where at the air,

2605
01:11:16,901 --> 01:11:18,570
Paulson ways Ho holds this camp.

2606
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:19,440
Uh,

2607
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,660
every year it's a big full on,

2608
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,180
there'll be multiple instructors teaching
all this stuff and all these people

2609
01:11:24,181 --> 01:11:27,900
come from all over his affiliate gyms
and they pile into our gym during our

2610
01:11:27,901 --> 01:11:28,531
training time.

2611
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:30,480
So he just integrates everyone together.

2612
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,370
And I always just tell Paul and I go,

2613
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:35,610
don't stick the Newbie fucking
goof balls in there with me.

2614
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:38,010
If I've got a fight coming
up and these user in here,

2615
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:39,270
they're going to get wrecked like that.

2616
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:39,540
That's,

2617
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:42,510
this is not my job to help this
dude have a good time at camp.

2618
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:43,381
I'm getting ready.

2619
01:11:43,381 --> 01:11:44,280
Please just don't do it,

2620
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:44,760
right.

2621
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,000
No,

2622
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:45,421
you could just,

2623
01:11:45,421 --> 01:11:46,111
you could just take it easy.

2624
01:11:46,111 --> 01:11:46,321
I'm like,

2625
01:11:46,321 --> 01:11:46,681
no,

2626
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:50,640
they're not going to go easy on me for
one because I'm me and they want to

2627
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:51,690
either they're excited,

2628
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:52,560
scared,

2629
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,760
or want to prove something,

2630
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:55,140
so I don't want it.

2631
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,340
I don't even want to deal with it.

2632
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:57,630
But if I have to,

2633
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:58,703
I'm burying them.

2634
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:00,750
So that's just the way it is.

2635
01:12:00,751 --> 01:12:01,141
So anyways,

2636
01:12:01,141 --> 01:12:01,501
we're in there.

2637
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:04,050
We're kickboxing that
this kid and fucking,

2638
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:04,741
he turns it up.

2639
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:04,951
I'm like,

2640
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:05,784
God damn it.

2641
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:06,900
So what do I do?

2642
01:12:06,901 --> 01:12:07,711
I step up,

2643
01:12:07,711 --> 01:12:08,760
throw a left high,

2644
01:12:08,761 --> 01:12:09,750
kick off the lead leg,

2645
01:12:09,751 --> 01:12:11,430
but I turn it over to hit
with the ball of the foot.

2646
01:12:11,431 --> 01:12:13,650
I just stabbed him right
in the jaw with it.

2647
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:14,953
He stuns,

2648
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:18,300
puts his hand up quits for the whole day.

2649
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:19,134
He's done.

2650
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:19,960
He says that,

2651
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:20,670
I don't,

2652
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,210
I'm done.

2653
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:22,043
Forget it.

2654
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:23,940
It was probably a good idea.

2655
01:12:23,941 --> 01:12:24,390
It was lovely.

2656
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:25,171
It was a good idea.

2657
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:27,810
I got a concussion for all I know.

2658
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:29,123
Whenever we learn,

2659
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,410
that's my problem with tournaments.

2660
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:33,710
Like especially those are
kickboxing tournament,

2661
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:34,171
they're doing,

2662
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:34,771
large guys are,

2663
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:37,080
they're getting essentially
knocked out in their first fight.

2664
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:37,913
They recover,

2665
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:38,680
you know,

2666
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:38,950
they,

2667
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:39,360
they,

2668
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,120
they get dropped or stunned or
fucked up and then they have like,

2669
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:42,510
you know,

2670
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:42,841
20,

2671
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:46,500
30 minutes for everything to cool down
and really hurt and then they get back in

2672
01:12:46,501 --> 01:12:47,340
there and do it again.

2673
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:48,271
Yeah,

2674
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:48,870
I hear Ya.

2675
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:49,261
And uh,

2676
01:12:49,261 --> 01:12:52,320
I was just having this conversation
with somebody the other day about,

2677
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,363
uh,

2678
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:54,660
I was with a referee actually,

2679
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:55,021
and I go,

2680
01:12:55,021 --> 01:12:55,854
you know,

2681
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:57,600
we need tournaments back in MMA.

2682
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:58,740
And he's like,

2683
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,131
and they go,

2684
01:12:59,131 --> 01:12:59,790
well,

2685
01:12:59,790 --> 01:12:59,930
you know,

2686
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:00,661
we can run a tournament.

2687
01:13:00,661 --> 01:13:01,050
And I go,

2688
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:01,883
no,

2689
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,900
I know the fucking stupid
ruling where they say,

2690
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:04,111
oh,

2691
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:05,250
as long as you don't exceed a five,

2692
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:06,630
five minute rounds in a night.

2693
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:07,110
And I go,

2694
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:07,920
that doesn't,

2695
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,420
if I'm fighting pro boxing,

2696
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,490
I'm out there for 36 minutes.

2697
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:15,240
You're telling me that an MMA
fighter can't go 36 minutes.

2698
01:13:15,241 --> 01:13:15,721
If it was,

2699
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:17,250
if you gave me 36 minutes,

2700
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:20,400
then you could go to fives
and three fives and a final.

2701
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,170
And he was like,

2702
01:13:22,171 --> 01:13:22,471
well,

2703
01:13:22,471 --> 01:13:24,420
there's guys who can barely
get through one five now.

2704
01:13:24,421 --> 01:13:24,660
I go,

2705
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:25,890
Oh fuck good.

2706
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:28,890
Hopefully they get the shit kicked out
of them and they fucking figure it out.

2707
01:13:28,891 --> 01:13:29,371
Either a,

2708
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:32,010
how to be able to go past the five or B.

2709
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,330
This ain't the sport for you.

2710
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:34,380
I mean,

2711
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:35,340
we're not supposed to make it.

2712
01:13:35,341 --> 01:13:36,630
So when you're a professional,

2713
01:13:36,631 --> 01:13:38,430
everybody doesn't need
to be able to compete.

2714
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:39,360
When you're an amateur.

2715
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:40,920
I have some understanding.

2716
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:42,690
Everyone should be able
to get in the ring with,

2717
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,820
with a modest amount of training,

2718
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:45,720
uh,

2719
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,620
to go out there and do it,

2720
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:47,790
but not pros.

2721
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,680
Why do you think that they
should bring back tournaments?

2722
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:54,120
Every combat sport in the
world has tournament day,

2723
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,073
everything.

2724
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:56,820
And we love it.

2725
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:58,680
We love the shit out of tournaments.

2726
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,180
Japan loves everything.

2727
01:14:00,181 --> 01:14:02,640
Fighting and going to tournaments
so much they fucking make,

2728
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:05,130
they'll have a TV show and it's battle.

2729
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:07,500
And there was a piece of celery
versus a Yam like which is,

2730
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:10,290
I don't even know how you
compare those tube or why,

2731
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,260
how you make them fight.

2732
01:14:11,261 --> 01:14:11,980
They didn't even give him a little

2733
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,720
knives or anything,

2734
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:18,280
but for a shield and tried and salary
fighters don't want to do tournaments

2735
01:14:18,281 --> 01:14:18,941
because they feel like,

2736
01:14:18,941 --> 01:14:21,460
like say if there's a four man tournament,

2737
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:26,490
you have a fight in the first round and
you win in 10 seconds by knockout and

2738
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:30,340
then they go to rounds and there's a draw.

2739
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:32,620
So they go to a third
round and it's brutal.

2740
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:36,610
They're all bang the fuck up and then
they have to fight you in the finals and

2741
01:14:36,611 --> 01:14:40,060
you went through 10 seconds of
fighting and they've been good.

2742
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:42,790
They've got the fuck beat out of
them and they're all banged up.

2743
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,380
It should have been a
better fighter I guess.

2744
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:45,370
Is that really what it is?

2745
01:14:45,371 --> 01:14:49,090
What if the draw is what have you
got fade or and a your opponent,

2746
01:14:49,091 --> 01:14:53,500
God willing to wimp willy the wimp
in his Cadillac coffin and willy,

2747
01:14:53,501 --> 01:14:54,070
the Wimp guy.

2748
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:57,460
K owed and the first
round and then you went,

2749
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,590
or what if it's raining hard rounds

2750
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:04,070
and then the other guy gets
Vandelay and he's cro cop.

2751
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:04,671
Yeah,

2752
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:05,510
well you did do that,

2753
01:15:05,511 --> 01:15:06,920
but fuck it.

2754
01:15:06,921 --> 01:15:07,521
You know what I did?

2755
01:15:07,521 --> 01:15:08,211
I laid in the back,

2756
01:15:08,211 --> 01:15:08,991
I had ivs,

2757
01:15:08,991 --> 01:15:09,890
I had ice on me.

2758
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:12,830
And honestly the biggest problem
wasn't even the fighting,

2759
01:15:12,831 --> 01:15:15,590
it was getting heat exhaustion before
you even showed up for the tournament

2760
01:15:15,591 --> 01:15:20,540
because dead summer of Orange County and
we had no air conditioning whatsoever.

2761
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:22,100
No breezeways and that old gym.

2762
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:25,010
And I started off doing 10 minute rounds,

2763
01:15:25,011 --> 01:15:27,530
just going through name profilers,

2764
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:28,423
owning them,

2765
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:30,050
and then all of a sudden eight minutes,

2766
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:31,130
then six minutes,

2767
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:34,160
then for then I can barely get a two
minute round off without falling apart.

2768
01:15:34,161 --> 01:15:34,590
And I'm just going,

2769
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:35,750
what the fuck is wrong with me?

2770
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:41,450
And then people start packing me with
ice bags in between rounds and in between

2771
01:15:41,451 --> 01:15:41,901
sessions.

2772
01:15:41,901 --> 01:15:43,880
And all of a sudden my energy
would start to come back.

2773
01:15:43,881 --> 01:15:45,020
Some I just go,

2774
01:15:45,021 --> 01:15:46,060
oh well this is fucked.

2775
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:47,110
Oh Wow.

2776
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:48,320
Let's get over there and do it.

2777
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:50,810
So you were training and
as you were training,

2778
01:15:50,811 --> 01:15:53,540
you had no air conditioning in the gym
and you're getting a heat exhaustion.

2779
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:56,110
It was fucking a hundred
degrees outside at times.

2780
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,580
Fucked with your conditioning when you
actually went to fight because you never

2781
01:15:58,581 --> 01:16:01,340
were able to push by the time tosh.

2782
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:04,230
But I mean there were things
like when Nogueira mounted me,

2783
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:04,890
right,

2784
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:08,670
I gave him my arm on purpose because I
couldn't get them off of mount because I

2785
01:16:08,671 --> 01:16:09,331
couldn't expand.

2786
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,250
That kind of energy just wasn't there.

2787
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:12,150
So if he,

2788
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:14,040
I know if he goes to try and arm bar me,

2789
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:14,874
that shit ain't going to happen.

2790
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:16,320
So this is just because of the,

2791
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:19,960
all the time that you spent in
the gym under heat exhaustion.

2792
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:20,680
Yes.

2793
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:20,970
So you,

2794
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:23,440
you were never able to do
those 10 minute rounds,

2795
01:16:23,441 --> 01:16:25,110
those long rounds in the gym because just,

2796
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:25,540
no,

2797
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,410
it just got too hot.

2798
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,960
Why didn't you guys would fucking
air conditioning and your gym?

2799
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:29,741
Not My gym,

2800
01:16:29,741 --> 01:16:30,700
not my decision.

2801
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,620
Now Eric Paulson has Jim.

2802
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:33,011
Yeah.

2803
01:16:33,011 --> 01:16:33,844
Was it cesium?

2804
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:34,810
But fuck,

2805
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:36,090
I,

2806
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:36,440
uh,

2807
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:36,800
I love,

2808
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,580
I struggled

2809
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:37,770
to,

2810
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:38,070
uh,

2811
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:38,903
to get back,

2812
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:39,753
uh,

2813
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:44,190
until it took me about until next year
before I really finally fucking felt

2814
01:16:44,191 --> 01:16:44,821
better again.

2815
01:16:44,821 --> 01:16:45,780
When I find master law,

2816
01:16:45,781 --> 01:16:47,810
I was still just struggle.

2817
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:48,221
My,

2818
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:51,300
my CNS was shot central nervous system.

2819
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:51,821
Oh yeah.

2820
01:16:51,821 --> 01:16:53,040
My adrenals is from,

2821
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:54,610
from the helix you off so bad.

2822
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,481
Wow.

2823
01:16:55,481 --> 01:16:56,830
What about Kronk Gym?

2824
01:16:56,831 --> 01:16:57,790
The fucking Detroit,

2825
01:16:57,791 --> 01:17:00,670
they would crank up the
heat and I hate that shit

2826
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:04,260
is I'm more susceptible to it,

2827
01:17:04,261 --> 01:17:08,900
I think than others because
I'm so white viking like that.

2828
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:09,620
If,

2829
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:09,861
you know,

2830
01:17:09,861 --> 01:17:11,930
a little bit of cold would probably
would have done me some good.

2831
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:12,141
Right.

2832
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:12,610
If you were,

2833
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:12,850
yeah.

2834
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:14,970
Some African dude in
there sparring with you,

2835
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:16,190
you'd have an advantage.

2836
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:16,701
But,

2837
01:17:16,701 --> 01:17:16,820
uh,

2838
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:21,080
some people don't take the heat as
well as others and some people do.

2839
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:21,441
You know,

2840
01:17:21,441 --> 01:17:22,580
it's just a matter of fact.

2841
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:23,040
And,

2842
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:23,873
and here's the thing,

2843
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,190
I got over there.

2844
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:26,630
I fought my ass off.

2845
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:27,980
I was exhausted.

2846
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:29,510
I could have been bowed out and be like,

2847
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:30,580
oh no cro cop,

2848
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:30,731
he's,

2849
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:31,151
he's gonna,

2850
01:17:31,151 --> 01:17:33,650
he's just going to walk over into the
finals and everybody who was going to be

2851
01:17:33,651 --> 01:17:33,770
like,

2852
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:34,340
oh,

2853
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:35,930
he had a really tough fight with Nogueira.

2854
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:36,770
That's acceptable.

2855
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,540
We'll give him a pass on that,

2856
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,860
but I wouldn't give me a pass.

2857
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,753
Fuck that.

2858
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:41,750
So what did I do?

2859
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,700
They put ice bags on anything.

2860
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:44,534
It was banged up.

2861
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:45,770
Doctors came back,

2862
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:50,771
gave me an ivy and some vitamins and a
hung it off of the locker door and I just

2863
01:17:50,781 --> 01:17:54,500
laid on the ground and I had been gloomy
Fuji with me and my ex girlfriend at

2864
01:17:54,501 --> 01:17:59,501
the time and Eric and [inaudible] and
my friends with me and I just was there

2865
01:17:59,871 --> 01:18:00,321
with them.

2866
01:18:00,321 --> 01:18:02,690
And the refs come,

2867
01:18:02,691 --> 01:18:03,890
the officials come back and go,

2868
01:18:03,891 --> 01:18:05,270
so are you going to fight the last fight?

2869
01:18:05,271 --> 01:18:05,451
And like,

2870
01:18:05,451 --> 01:18:05,661
yes,

2871
01:18:05,661 --> 01:18:08,030
I am damn right I am,

2872
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:10,610
because that's what a man does.

2873
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,133
And uh,

2874
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:13,101
I fought,

2875
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:13,641
it doesn't run,

2876
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:14,930
man does is in a tournament.

2877
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,480
[inaudible] get the fuck out of here.

2878
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:18,800
You know,

2879
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,520
I didn't show up to,

2880
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,040
to take second place.

2881
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:26,350
I showed up to take first
or die trying and uh,

2882
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:27,561
fuck it,

2883
01:18:27,561 --> 01:18:28,160
you know?

2884
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,860
But why do you think that that
it's better to have a tournament?

2885
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:31,850
Like what is it about it?

2886
01:18:31,851 --> 01:18:34,310
Just because the public
anticipates having those fights,

2887
01:18:34,311 --> 01:18:35,510
watching how it plays out.

2888
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,320
Interesting to see how,

2889
01:18:37,321 --> 01:18:37,581
I mean,

2890
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:37,851
come on,

2891
01:18:37,851 --> 01:18:38,840
look at March madness.

2892
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,400
It's one of the biggest things ever.

2893
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:41,720
And if it wasn't a tournament,

2894
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:43,070
people would not be as excited.

2895
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,140
But that's a terminal over
a long period of time.

2896
01:18:45,141 --> 01:18:46,670
They're not to a bunch
of games in a night.

2897
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:49,040
That's actually a perfect
example of why it doesn't apply,

2898
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:50,510
but it just,

2899
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:53,660
I just mean the concept of tournaments
and even doing tournament's over over

2900
01:18:53,661 --> 01:18:54,051
time,

2901
01:18:54,051 --> 01:18:54,831
it's still great to,

2902
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:57,260
but the one night tournament is,

2903
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:58,420
well,

2904
01:18:58,420 --> 01:18:59,780
let's see who comes out on top.

2905
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:02,240
Plus it's a great way to try and read,

2906
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,700
establish a orders.

2907
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:05,890
So you,

2908
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:06,081
if,

2909
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:07,640
let's say you have a whole bunch of pool,

2910
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,970
they got a handful of all these guys and
you don't know who really fits where,

2911
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:12,470
boom,

2912
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:13,760
they go through this one night tournament.

2913
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:13,961
Oh,

2914
01:19:13,961 --> 01:19:14,541
there's a winner.

2915
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,620
Someone was able to gut it out
and come out on top and come over,

2916
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,270
come out with all that dealing
with all that adversity.

2917
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:24,200
And then you look down the
line like who did what?

2918
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,540
And then even the guy who did
the worst and the tournament,

2919
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:28,910
let's say all of a sudden
non tournament style,

2920
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:30,770
they start racking up
the wins and it's like,

2921
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:31,431
Oh wow,

2922
01:19:31,431 --> 01:19:31,761
you know,

2923
01:19:31,761 --> 01:19:32,630
look at that story.

2924
01:19:32,631 --> 01:19:37,010
That person's coming back from what we
consider to be a disaster and now their

2925
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,540
Phoenix rising from the ashes.

2926
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:40,910
It gives such an opportunity to uh,

2927
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,320
to exempt,

2928
01:19:42,321 --> 01:19:43,640
to show human spirit,

2929
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:45,920
to show overcoming adversity.

2930
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:48,510
And it's an instant trade off.

2931
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,110
I think it's a great idea for grappling.

2932
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:53,330
Eddie Bravo had the
Eddie Bravo invitational,

2933
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:57,260
the Ebi last week and it was a tournament
and it was really exciting to watch,

2934
01:19:57,261 --> 01:20:00,380
watch guys make it to the
finals and watch guys,

2935
01:20:00,381 --> 01:20:00,591
you know,

2936
01:20:00,591 --> 01:20:02,120
you see the brackets play out.

2937
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:03,380
I think it's great for grappling.

2938
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:05,510
What I worry about it
is with head injuries.

2939
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:08,220
I worry about guys
fighting the first round,

2940
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:09,660
getting their bell rang,

2941
01:20:09,661 --> 01:20:11,460
having some internal bleeding perhaps.

2942
01:20:11,461 --> 01:20:12,510
And then fighting in the final.

2943
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:12,890
I don't,

2944
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,640
I don't think that the medical,

2945
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:15,533
um,

2946
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:16,280
uh,

2947
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,600
observation should be,

2948
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:18,180
should be,

2949
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,200
should be overlooked.

2950
01:20:19,201 --> 01:20:20,130
I think that's important.

2951
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:20,461
But,

2952
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:21,210
uh,

2953
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:22,190
I really think tournaments,

2954
01:20:22,191 --> 01:20:24,850
we would help bring some
excitement back to him and May,

2955
01:20:24,851 --> 01:20:26,190
but then here's the other thing,

2956
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,140
I think five minute rounds
are not long enough.

2957
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:29,670
I think we do a 10 minute rounds,

2958
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:30,540
at the very least.

2959
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:31,500
I knew.

2960
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:32,200
Agree.

2961
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,960
I see you nodding your
head over there guys.

2962
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,860
Let's not even talk about how the 10
point must system doesn't belong in MMA.

2963
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:39,780
Not all terrible,

2964
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:40,560
but,

2965
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,393
uh,

2966
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:45,570
and I understood why they use the 10
point because it's to try and keep people

2967
01:20:45,571 --> 01:20:46,404
honest.

2968
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:50,340
All you can see that they scored the
round that there no one's sitting.

2969
01:20:50,341 --> 01:20:52,140
That's as it's been explained to me.

2970
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,340
But uh,

2971
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:54,131
well they just borrowed,

2972
01:20:54,131 --> 01:20:54,791
it doesn't box.

2973
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:55,640
It doesn't need it.

2974
01:20:55,641 --> 01:20:55,930
You know,

2975
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:56,370
he just,

2976
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:56,941
I liked it.

2977
01:20:56,941 --> 01:20:59,060
And Japan where they just look okay.

2978
01:20:59,310 --> 01:20:59,850
And pancreas,

2979
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:02,640
it used to be two judges
on the outside and the ref,

2980
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:05,730
their judgements at the end,

2981
01:21:05,731 --> 01:21:08,040
if they decide all three
of them convene up,

2982
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,113
he won.

2983
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:09,631
I see,

2984
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:13,800
I disagree with that using the ref
cause I think a referee should,

2985
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:15,900
I think that's a very singular job.

2986
01:21:15,901 --> 01:21:18,720
And I think the referee's job
should be making sure that I can,

2987
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:19,613
I can see,

2988
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:20,850
I can see the argument.

2989
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:22,530
I'm just saying how it used to be,

2990
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,400
but even still,

2991
01:21:23,401 --> 01:21:24,630
no matter what the idea was.

2992
01:21:24,631 --> 01:21:24,781
And,

2993
01:21:24,781 --> 01:21:25,830
and back in pride,

2994
01:21:25,831 --> 01:21:26,100
it was,

2995
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,030
you had your criteria.

2996
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:29,940
Matt would sit ringside
with a piece of paper,

2997
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:32,980
one name and then another name and a
line down the middle for each side.

2998
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:37,510
And he would sit there and he would put
hash marks and each box and those hash

2999
01:21:37,511 --> 01:21:40,440
marks meant something along
those criteria that were,

3000
01:21:40,441 --> 01:21:41,274
uh,

3001
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,300
that were important that he could look
back and it would help him remember how

3002
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:46,134
this fight went.

3003
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:46,431
Well,

3004
01:21:46,431 --> 01:21:46,661
Matt,

3005
01:21:46,661 --> 01:21:47,760
it's an excellent referee.

3006
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:48,511
Oh well yeah.

3007
01:21:48,511 --> 01:21:48,691
Well,

3008
01:21:48,691 --> 01:21:49,950
and this is just same as a judge,

3009
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:51,293
but uh,

3010
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:53,310
so I agree with,

3011
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:54,720
I'm more towards that side,

3012
01:21:54,721 --> 01:21:57,900
but even still now you see guys
just gaming a five minute round,

3013
01:21:58,470 --> 01:21:59,820
stifling doing this,

3014
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:00,301
doing that,

3015
01:22:00,301 --> 01:22:02,520
and then petering off to the fucking,

3016
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,080
the stool coming back out.

3017
01:22:04,081 --> 01:22:08,310
And just trying to run the same thing
or when two out of three and then they

3018
01:22:08,311 --> 01:22:09,730
walk out and look at me.

3019
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:09,961
It's like,

3020
01:22:09,961 --> 01:22:10,081
well,

3021
01:22:10,081 --> 01:22:11,850
you didn't even really try
to kick that guy's ass.

3022
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,970
Well at one have fun with that.

3023
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,640
What do you think about standups?

3024
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:19,290
Do you think the standup
should be a part of MMA?

3025
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:19,890
Yes,

3026
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:20,370
you do,

3027
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:22,770
but that has to be with
the other thing with him.

3028
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,101
Amazing.

3029
01:22:23,101 --> 01:22:26,100
He needs to be more attention to stalling.

3030
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:30,570
If you're not trying to finish
your opponent and damage them,

3031
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:31,404
take them out.

3032
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:32,603
You're stolen.

3033
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,950
What do you think about
if they do have rounds?

3034
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:37,170
Like say if you go a 10 minute round,

3035
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:38,190
at the end of 10 minutes,

3036
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:38,501
you're,

3037
01:22:38,501 --> 01:22:39,570
you're on top of the guy.

3038
01:22:39,571 --> 01:22:40,170
Mount doom.

3039
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:40,410
Yeah.

3040
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:42,570
Start right back with the
mount on the second round.

3041
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:44,460
That's an interesting concept.

3042
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:45,001
But a,

3043
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:46,800
I like standing in
backup on the feet again,

3044
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,290
but why that gives us
striker a big advantage.

3045
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:51,090
You need to be a well rounded fighter,

3046
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:51,501
right?

3047
01:22:51,501 --> 01:22:53,550
But if you work so hard to
get a guy to the ground,

3048
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:55,230
he didn't earn getting
back up to his feet.

3049
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:56,820
Why should he be able to
get back up to his feet?

3050
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:56,941
Well,

3051
01:22:56,941 --> 01:23:00,200
that's the whole concept of rounds
is the restart of the contest.

3052
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,080
Right?

3053
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,480
Restart of you getting
a chance to get back up.

3054
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:04,343
That's true too.

3055
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:04,930
Yeah.

3056
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,400
So if he can survive the round,

3057
01:23:06,401 --> 01:23:06,901
what does that mean?

3058
01:23:06,901 --> 01:23:07,030
If,

3059
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:08,560
if it is that dire to you,

3060
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:13,240
that you cannot afford to have that guy
ever get back to his feet either by the

3061
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:17,830
round ending or by him escaping or the
referee standing up for an activity.

3062
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:18,480
Well,

3063
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,313
one,

3064
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,420
you're fucked as a fight or anyways,

3065
01:23:21,421 --> 01:23:21,580
you're,

3066
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:22,960
you have a huge deficit.

3067
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:24,243
Number two,

3068
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,090
you better finish him,

3069
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:25,840
right?

3070
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:26,631
You better finish them.

3071
01:23:26,631 --> 01:23:27,290
That also goes to,

3072
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:27,431
so,

3073
01:23:27,431 --> 01:23:27,611
hey,

3074
01:23:27,611 --> 01:23:30,400
if you're the greatest grappler submission
guy in the world and you have no

3075
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:32,770
takedowns enjoy getting your ass kicked.

3076
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:33,101
Well,

3077
01:23:33,101 --> 01:23:36,850
there's a few fighters that are really
good at holding guys down and I don't

3078
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:39,430
think there's anything wrong with that
because I think it's important to know

3079
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,510
that a guy can hold you down.

3080
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:41,560
Like Ben aspirins.

3081
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:42,640
My perfect example,

3082
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:46,960
Ben Asterisk is such a good fucking
wrestler that he gets ahold of guys and he

3083
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:49,150
puts them on their back
and they can't get back up.

3084
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,680
And if that's the case,

3085
01:23:50,681 --> 01:23:54,910
like standing a guy giving a guy a free
shot to stand back up because Ben asked

3086
01:23:54,911 --> 01:23:55,040
her,

3087
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,630
may or may not be as active
as you would like or it might,

3088
01:23:58,631 --> 01:24:02,210
but still the guy who was on the
bottom wants to get up but you can't.

3089
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:02,680
Right.

3090
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,281
But you know,

3091
01:24:03,281 --> 01:24:04,540
you've got 10 minutes to work.

3092
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:06,400
I F I C and uh,

3093
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:07,930
I think honestly with 10 minutes,

3094
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:11,290
I don't think ask him wouldn't have as
many decisions as he does because we'll

3095
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:13,390
ask her and has kept a lot
of people on their back.

3096
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:16,360
I've seen him work a lot
too looking for submissions.

3097
01:24:16,361 --> 01:24:17,194
Punching.

3098
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,290
He's not a power puncher would you say?

3099
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:20,350
He's up til a puncher,

3100
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:23,200
but one FC allows them to do
knees to the head on the ground.

3101
01:24:23,201 --> 01:24:23,710
That makes a big,

3102
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:25,060
that's another thing I would change,

3103
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:26,990
I think needs of the head soccer kicked,

3104
01:24:26,991 --> 01:24:27,311
stomped,

3105
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:27,521
you know,

3106
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:28,660
I'm all for all that.

3107
01:24:28,661 --> 01:24:29,590
But at the very least,

3108
01:24:29,591 --> 01:24:31,540
knees to the head change things and uh,

3109
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:32,350
a lot,

3110
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:33,610
especially even for the grappler.

3111
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:34,600
Uh,

3112
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,960
but with 10 minutes you want
to call Ben Aspirin boring.

3113
01:24:37,961 --> 01:24:40,240
I think in 10 minutes he's got finishes.

3114
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:41,590
Yeah.

3115
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:42,550
I think that,

3116
01:24:42,551 --> 01:24:43,384
uh,

3117
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:44,680
a lot of guys would have finishes,

3118
01:24:44,681 --> 01:24:47,080
but the other thing that changes that
is when a ref is standing over the top

3119
01:24:47,081 --> 01:24:47,350
going,

3120
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:48,183
action,

3121
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:49,203
action.

3122
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:49,720
Action.

3123
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:50,553
Okay,

3124
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:51,310
get up.

3125
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:52,030
You're stalling.

3126
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:52,391
Your cool.

3127
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:52,751
You know,

3128
01:24:52,751 --> 01:24:53,510
when a guy is stalling,

3129
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:54,430
you don't want a guy is not.

3130
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:55,301
Yeah,

3131
01:24:55,301 --> 01:24:57,340
but I think a guy who's stalling,

3132
01:24:57,341 --> 01:24:58,930
if you can't get that guy off you,

3133
01:24:58,931 --> 01:24:59,890
fuck you.

3134
01:24:59,910 --> 01:25:01,420
Well that's a different fight then.

3135
01:25:01,421 --> 01:25:03,400
That's that settle
because the guy you are,

3136
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:04,181
you're on the bottom.

3137
01:25:04,181 --> 01:25:05,014
You're still fighting.

3138
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:05,350
No,

3139
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:05,770
no,

3140
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:06,970
I hear you that way.

3141
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:09,580
But we're talking about prize fighting.

3142
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:09,790
Right.

3143
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:10,590
Entertainment.

3144
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:11,170
Mm.

3145
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:11,620
Okay.

3146
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:11,851
If,

3147
01:25:11,851 --> 01:25:12,091
if,

3148
01:25:12,091 --> 01:25:12,251
if,

3149
01:25:12,251 --> 01:25:15,970
if it's the fight that you're talking
about that's not for entertainment,

3150
01:25:15,971 --> 01:25:17,140
no one wants to pay to see that.

3151
01:25:17,141 --> 01:25:17,974
You know what that is?

3152
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:20,590
That's catch wrestling in the 18 hundreds.

3153
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:26,070
That's pro wrestling in the 19 hundreds
where three hours plus of guys trying to

3154
01:25:26,081 --> 01:25:30,910
get an advantage and can't because
they're so well versed of each other.

3155
01:25:30,911 --> 01:25:31,631
They're so tough.

3156
01:25:31,631 --> 01:25:32,351
They're so skilled.

3157
01:25:32,351 --> 01:25:33,850
One guy getting stuck on the bottom,

3158
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:34,840
he can't get up.

3159
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:35,891
There's no restarts,

3160
01:25:35,891 --> 01:25:36,611
there's no nothing.

3161
01:25:36,611 --> 01:25:37,360
There's no,

3162
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,140
there it goes.

3163
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:39,460
Let's see when that first fall comes,

3164
01:25:39,461 --> 01:25:40,690
but that died out.

3165
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,553
It didn't work.

3166
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:44,140
If you look at like say like what
they were doing with a lead Xc,

3167
01:25:44,141 --> 01:25:46,900
that's like the worst case example of
trying to make it an entertainment.

3168
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:47,760
Sure,

3169
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,100
sure,

3170
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:51,100
and I'm not suggesting that
you just do it on the DC.

3171
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:51,851
Do they used to make,

3172
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:52,411
they used to Dan,

3173
01:25:52,411 --> 01:25:53,244
Dan people.

3174
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:55,390
They would take seconds on the ground.

3175
01:25:55,391 --> 01:25:56,240
They stand you back up.

3176
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:57,550
He stood up big country.

3177
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,960
He was on top of our Lawsky inside control
working with Kamora or would you call

3178
01:26:01,961 --> 01:26:02,560
it double risk?

3179
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,400
I've devoted like,

3180
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:03,621
yes.

3181
01:26:03,621 --> 01:26:04,460
Now he,

3182
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,050
I don't know if he was
ever going to get it,

3183
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:08,070
but he was in an advantage.

3184
01:26:08,071 --> 01:26:08,631
His position,

3185
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:09,800
he was working for a finish.

3186
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,300
He should not have been stood up and he's
an expert in that particular style of

3187
01:26:14,301 --> 01:26:14,661
fighting.

3188
01:26:14,661 --> 01:26:15,650
He's in a submission next,

3189
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,900
he's a ground guy and he
wasn't just laying on him.

3190
01:26:17,901 --> 01:26:20,890
He was trying to submit our Lawsky and uh,

3191
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:21,170
you know,

3192
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:23,570
of course with anything you need,

3193
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:27,740
even as a sports sits now we need better
referees and we need better judges.

3194
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,533
Yeah.

3195
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:30,291
That stoppage.

3196
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:33,170
Last week they reversed that.

3197
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:33,351
Oh,

3198
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:34,430
did they reversed it?

3199
01:26:34,431 --> 01:26:34,641
Yeah,

3200
01:26:34,641 --> 01:26:35,540
it's a no contest.

3201
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:37,010
Even when Faber's down,

3202
01:26:37,011 --> 01:26:39,890
they're getting walloped on
his shoulder and it's like,

3203
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:40,993
show me something.

3204
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:42,913
One,

3205
01:26:43,450 --> 01:26:45,020
you couldn't see his thumbs up.

3206
01:26:45,021 --> 01:26:45,854
I got it.

3207
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:47,090
On the second hand,

3208
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:50,000
you can tell he's not getting
his ass kicked right now.

3209
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:51,463
Let it go.

3210
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:55,250
Let them go when a guy's turtling and
the guy was just hitting your gloves and

3211
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:56,084
arms.

3212
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:57,200
And then if I get stopped,

3213
01:26:57,201 --> 01:26:58,220
that is very frustrating.

3214
01:26:58,221 --> 01:26:59,120
It is this problem with that.

3215
01:26:59,121 --> 01:27:00,980
But I watched all these
fights back in the day.

3216
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:03,950
I'd seen dudes getting
shellshocked on top,

3217
01:27:03,951 --> 01:27:08,030
just just artillery dropped
on him and surviving it.

3218
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,650
Then reversing the fight.

3219
01:27:09,651 --> 01:27:10,520
Dude's all totally,

3220
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:15,500
totally petered out and Brock Lesnar
changes and just kicking the shit out of

3221
01:27:15,501 --> 01:27:15,650
them.

3222
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:16,160
Yeah,

3223
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:16,670
it happens.

3224
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:17,720
And Brock Lesnar and car when,

3225
01:27:17,721 --> 01:27:18,710
that's a good example too,

3226
01:27:18,711 --> 01:27:20,900
but no one wants to let
that happen anymore.

3227
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:21,771
Well as too brutal.

3228
01:27:21,771 --> 01:27:21,941
Well,

3229
01:27:21,941 --> 01:27:22,251
we're not,

3230
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:22,731
we're fighting.

3231
01:27:22,731 --> 01:27:23,750
We're not doing patty cake.

3232
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:24,261
Well,

3233
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:28,160
there's always that thing about trying
to make it more appealing to the

3234
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:29,060
mainstream.

3235
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,950
It will be better for everybody,

3236
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:34,850
and yet it's not better for the
people that are actually doing it.

3237
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:35,360
No,

3238
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:39,110
it's definitely not better for someone
who gets stuck in a position and they

3239
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,420
intelligently defend yourself.

3240
01:27:41,421 --> 01:27:41,571
Well,

3241
01:27:41,571 --> 01:27:42,404
guess what?

3242
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:44,690
There's some positions where
willing guys wailing on you.

3243
01:27:44,691 --> 01:27:46,610
It's intelligent to just cover up.

3244
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:47,120
Sure.

3245
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,920
Remember a tank and a seven,

3246
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:52,470
seven kept palm striking him and just
throwing all these shots and the seven

3247
01:27:52,471 --> 01:27:52,910
wasn't,

3248
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:55,640
it wasn't palm striking because you're
not a punch just because he didn't want

3249
01:27:55,641 --> 01:27:56,474
to break his hand.

3250
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:57,530
No gloves,

3251
01:27:57,530 --> 01:27:58,363
no wraps.

3252
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,800
So he smack and a tank,

3253
01:28:00,801 --> 01:28:01,340
the tank,

3254
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:02,270
he tries to get up,

3255
01:28:02,271 --> 01:28:03,104
but he can't.

3256
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:04,183
Now,

3257
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,590
one of these modern reps are
probably stopped that fight.

3258
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:06,771
Oh,

3259
01:28:06,771 --> 01:28:08,210
you're not intelligent
that defending yourself.

3260
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:10,160
He's not going to go out.

3261
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:12,110
He's not getting his bell rung.

3262
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:14,090
He's not getting the
shit kicked out of him.

3263
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:15,920
He just can't get up right now.

3264
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:17,241
Frank talked about,

3265
01:28:17,241 --> 01:28:17,411
Oh,

3266
01:28:17,411 --> 01:28:18,680
when a tank talked about it,

3267
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:20,000
he said a hell nightmare.

3268
01:28:20,001 --> 01:28:21,750
I was getting molested by Freddie Mercury.

3269
01:28:21,751 --> 01:28:22,584
Yeah.

3270
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:23,920
Uh,

3271
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:24,150
and,

3272
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:24,660
and,

3273
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,450
and tank tried to get up.

3274
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:26,750
He was,

3275
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:28,010
he was just getting controlled.

3276
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:29,300
He couldn't get up at seven.

3277
01:28:29,301 --> 01:28:31,040
Didn't have the ability to
really finish him either.

3278
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:31,430
Right.

3279
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:33,260
So it is what it is.

3280
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:33,981
That's what it is.

3281
01:28:33,981 --> 01:28:34,330
You know,

3282
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:35,510
I needed to keep going,

3283
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:36,770
but I don't think that should be stood up.

3284
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:37,430
What about,

3285
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:37,731
no,

3286
01:28:37,731 --> 01:28:40,430
not in that case cause cause
seven was incredibly active.

3287
01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:40,940
Right.

3288
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:41,870
He was trying,

3289
01:28:41,871 --> 01:28:43,430
he just didn't really have the,

3290
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:44,290
the,

3291
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:44,940
the,

3292
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:46,370
the scalability yet.

3293
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:47,690
And here's another one.

3294
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:51,710
Ruan Pot's getting punched in the ribs
and then stopping it because he's just,

3295
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:52,870
he's stuffing Elton.

3296
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:53,150
Yeah.

3297
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:54,020
Do you see him tapping?

3298
01:28:54,140 --> 01:28:54,680
No.

3299
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,180
Do you see him saying I want out?

3300
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,073
No.

3301
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:57,471
Yeah,

3302
01:28:57,471 --> 01:28:59,870
I didn't agree with and I know how much
he's getting punched in the fucking

3303
01:28:59,871 --> 01:29:00,230
ribs.

3304
01:29:00,230 --> 01:29:01,590
Did Adam get punched in the ribs?

3305
01:29:01,591 --> 01:29:04,440
They stopped that fight just to rescue
everybody from how boring it was.

3306
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:06,930
Cause he was just on top of him
punching him in the same spot.

3307
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:07,710
Everybody's like this.

3308
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,310
We've seen it now.

3309
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:09,170
Who Look at that Bruce.

3310
01:29:09,171 --> 01:29:09,930
So what?

3311
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:10,950
It is bruised.

3312
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,030
This is a bruise.

3313
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:12,873
Very bad.

3314
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:15,720
So sore tomorrow he's going
to have a black and blue spot.

3315
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:17,573
Yes.

3316
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:18,880
A real black and blues Paul.

3317
01:29:18,881 --> 01:29:19,281
Oh my God.

3318
01:29:19,281 --> 01:29:20,970
And I even turned yellow
and purple at some point.

3319
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,050
It could very well turn
like orange Ygrene.

3320
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:25,170
Oh God,

3321
01:29:25,171 --> 01:29:26,010
we can't allow that.

3322
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:26,903
That's what I'm saying.

3323
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,230
What if stand them up?

3324
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:29,123
Yeah.

3325
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:29,760
Yeah.

3326
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,050
Or stop the fight all together.

3327
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:32,580
That's not intelligent defense.

3328
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:33,450
There's not enough.

3329
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,460
There's certain guys
that fight in the UFC.

3330
01:29:35,461 --> 01:29:36,180
We got to go,

3331
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:36,600
man,

3332
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,130
who the fuck let you fight in the UFC?

3333
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,930
Well they need a lot of fighters.

3334
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,640
They have so many events,

3335
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:42,331
so,

3336
01:29:42,331 --> 01:29:42,871
so,

3337
01:29:42,871 --> 01:29:43,770
so many events.

3338
01:29:43,771 --> 01:29:46,150
They got to fill them up
and there's just too many.

3339
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:47,173
Do you think there's too many?

3340
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:47,710
Yes.

3341
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:48,090
Yeah I do.

3342
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:48,923
There are,

3343
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:49,950
you know,

3344
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:54,360
they have a plan for what they're trying
to accomplish and this is what they see

3345
01:29:54,361 --> 01:29:54,871
is the,

3346
01:29:54,871 --> 01:29:55,830
is the path to doing.

3347
01:29:55,831 --> 01:29:56,100
So,

3348
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,120
you know what I think there should be,

3349
01:29:57,150 --> 01:29:58,920
I think should be an a
league and a B league.

3350
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,470
I agree that there should
be a UFC and a strike force.

3351
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,333
I agree.

3352
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:07,430
If that fight should have one headliner
type dude or one main card type guy and

3353
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:08,850
arrested just up and comers.

3354
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:09,331
Yeah,

3355
01:30:09,331 --> 01:30:09,870
why not?

3356
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:10,141
I mean,

3357
01:30:10,141 --> 01:30:12,540
and then those guys
will graduate to become,

3358
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:13,370
you know,

3359
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:13,620
well,

3360
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:14,520
can you imagine if it,

3361
01:30:14,521 --> 01:30:15,690
you even even this,

3362
01:30:15,691 --> 01:30:16,260
what if,

3363
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:21,260
what if they kept Strikeforce and UFC and
let's say Strikeforce went pride style

3364
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:27,810
and UFC was the UFC and then they had
a super bowl match every year and each

3365
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:29,280
year with switch one this year.

3366
01:30:29,281 --> 01:30:30,000
It's pride.

3367
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,970
It's pride world rules
this year at UFC rules.

3368
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:34,223
Oh God,

3369
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:35,370
I can hear it now.

3370
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:35,851
Oh.

3371
01:30:35,851 --> 01:30:40,500
But the difference in that if you
can't fight and one of the other,

3372
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:43,500
if it is that dire to you as an athlete,

3373
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,490
that you can only can,

3374
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:46,740
you can only be successful in one arena.

3375
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,420
You're just not that good.

3376
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:48,811
Well,

3377
01:30:48,811 --> 01:30:49,800
you're not that well rounded.

3378
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:50,730
Well for sure.

3379
01:30:50,731 --> 01:30:51,211
But I mean,

3380
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:53,700
anything you can do on one you
can do in the other really well.

3381
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:56,910
We did see big differences between of
guys fighting in the cage and got us

3382
01:30:56,911 --> 01:30:58,830
fighting in the ring
that had to do with it.

3383
01:30:58,830 --> 01:30:59,100
No,

3384
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:01,930
you don't think cro cop was talking
about how big of a different it's,

3385
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:04,590
it was elbows on the ground
was a big difference as well.

3386
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:06,000
That definitely changes some things,

3387
01:31:06,001 --> 01:31:06,301
but no,

3388
01:31:06,301 --> 01:31:07,134
I don't think that was it.

3389
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,160
So you think it's just the
lack of preparation pop?

3390
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:12,900
I personally don't have a
perfect answer for that,

3391
01:31:12,901 --> 01:31:13,770
but I don't believe it.

3392
01:31:13,771 --> 01:31:14,604
It was that,

3393
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:14,911
well,

3394
01:31:14,911 --> 01:31:16,740
obviously he did much better after that.

3395
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:17,041
Yes.

3396
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:20,160
He got better at figuring out of the
cage and the elbows on the ground and the

3397
01:31:20,161 --> 01:31:20,701
defense.

3398
01:31:20,701 --> 01:31:21,060
Yes.

3399
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:25,530
So it's probably just a lack of the proper
preparation that maybe this is only a

3400
01:31:25,531 --> 01:31:26,341
few places.

3401
01:31:26,341 --> 01:31:27,060
Like if you,

3402
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:29,760
if you really looked at
a young athletes today,

3403
01:31:29,761 --> 01:31:30,990
they want to compete in MMA.

3404
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:35,460
Is there a dozen places in this country
that you could go and get a proper

3405
01:31:35,461 --> 01:31:38,950
education as far as like being a
real professional MMA fighters,

3406
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:39,803
even a dozen.

3407
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:40,110
I,

3408
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:40,790
you know,

3409
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:45,330
I can't say I've done all the research
to say conclusively one way or the other.

3410
01:31:45,331 --> 01:31:48,240
I know that AMC CSW one of the best,

3411
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:49,103
uh,

3412
01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:50,340
AMCs I mean,

3413
01:31:50,341 --> 01:31:53,310
Matt Hume is about as knowledgeable
as anybody has ever lived well,

3414
01:31:53,311 --> 01:31:54,570
and looks at me and Matt human,

3415
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:58,710
Eric Paulson or kind of cut from the
same cloth and that their lineage comes

3416
01:31:58,711 --> 01:31:59,890
down from Karl Gotch,

3417
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:00,910
from the shoot,

3418
01:32:00,911 --> 01:32:04,780
from a Siama and finicky and you know,

3419
01:32:04,781 --> 01:32:05,770
well rounded,

3420
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:07,600
full meal deal dues.

3421
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:08,470
They could do everything.

3422
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:09,010
Yup.

3423
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:09,371
And,

3424
01:32:09,371 --> 01:32:10,204
uh,

3425
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:11,560
you know,

3426
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,790
so there's that.

3427
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:13,061
But,

3428
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:13,590
uh,

3429
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:13,820
I,

3430
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:14,180
I'm,

3431
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:14,681
I mean,

3432
01:32:14,681 --> 01:32:15,221
I don't know.

3433
01:32:15,221 --> 01:32:15,491
I mean,

3434
01:32:15,491 --> 01:32:19,390
I imagine Greg Jackson's could
probably make you a con for us.

3435
01:32:19,391 --> 01:32:20,020
A hobby.

3436
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:20,650
Yeah.

3437
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:21,040
Maybe.

3438
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:21,341
I mean,

3439
01:32:21,341 --> 01:32:21,491
I,

3440
01:32:21,491 --> 01:32:22,810
I've never trained her to these people.

3441
01:32:22,811 --> 01:32:25,510
I knew that I was very,

3442
01:32:25,511 --> 01:32:30,511
when I moved from when I moved from
maths gym to go train somewhere else,

3443
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:34,420
it was really hard for me to find,

3444
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:39,990
there wasn't very many people back then
and I felt like I could go there and

3445
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:44,980
learn where I wouldn't be the one
dictating all the training all the time.

3446
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:49,840
I would be somewhere where I
could learn and be trained.

3447
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:53,660
What made you decide to go from Seattle
and then live in southern California?

3448
01:32:53,661 --> 01:32:55,220
How come you don't stay up
there and train with Matt?

3449
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:56,203
Uh,

3450
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:59,060
at the time it just
wasn't really feasible.

3451
01:32:59,061 --> 01:33:03,230
I didn't have the sparring partners and
Matt wasn't really around that much,

3452
01:33:03,231 --> 01:33:06,590
so I was ending up having to do a lot of
my own training because he was going to

3453
01:33:06,591 --> 01:33:07,700
pride to judge.

3454
01:33:07,701 --> 01:33:09,590
He had a lot of stuff on his plate.

3455
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:10,011
And,

3456
01:33:10,011 --> 01:33:10,650
uh,

3457
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:11,030
and,

3458
01:33:11,030 --> 01:33:12,140
and especially like I said,

3459
01:33:12,141 --> 01:33:13,700
I had no sparring partners.

3460
01:33:13,701 --> 01:33:14,534
I had nothing.

3461
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:15,171
Uh,

3462
01:33:15,171 --> 01:33:15,711
I was re,

3463
01:33:15,711 --> 01:33:19,820
sandy was my main dude and we would do
a lot of training together every night,

3464
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,410
somewhat Jeff months in.

3465
01:33:21,411 --> 01:33:25,310
But a lot of time I ended up teaching
Jeff and even teaching Reese and they were

3466
01:33:25,311 --> 01:33:26,900
great guys and I learned a lot from,

3467
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:27,770
they were very,

3468
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:28,011
very,

3469
01:33:28,011 --> 01:33:28,844
very helpful,

3470
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:33,710
but I didn't have sparring
partners and then I just thought,

3471
01:33:33,711 --> 01:33:34,340
well,

3472
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:35,330
this isn't the place to be.

3473
01:33:35,331 --> 01:33:40,331
Seattle is my barn on favorite place in
the U S and one of my favorite place in

3474
01:33:40,741 --> 01:33:41,191
the whole world,

3475
01:33:41,191 --> 01:33:42,290
and then she was an amazing city.

3476
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,153
Do you like clouds?

3477
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:44,150
I like clouds.

3478
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:44,841
I like Flan.

3479
01:33:44,841 --> 01:33:45,440
Russian.

3480
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:48,380
I'm into suppression
and heroin altogether.

3481
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:49,080
Coffee?

3482
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:49,360
Yup.

3483
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,640
Stinky post lost.

3484
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:51,840
Hey,

3485
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:52,860
what'd you come up with that?

3486
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:53,310
Yeah.

3487
01:33:53,310 --> 01:33:54,010
What the hell?

3488
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:54,220
Why?

3489
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:55,040
Why do you have Megan?

3490
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,790
Seattle's think he puts
his stories are what?

3491
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:57,091
Yeah.

3492
01:33:57,091 --> 01:33:57,924
What are you talking about?

3493
01:33:57,930 --> 01:33:58,890
They just never clean it.

3494
01:33:58,891 --> 01:34:00,390
They're just all in bed sleeping,

3495
01:34:00,391 --> 01:34:01,290
crying and shit.

3496
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:02,790
That's not true at all.

3497
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:03,930
No Way.

3498
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:04,501
First of all,

3499
01:34:04,501 --> 01:34:06,270
they don't clean your pussy.

3500
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,153
Yeah.

3501
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:09,280
Then the self cleaning org,

3502
01:34:09,281 --> 01:34:14,281
they have a lot of probiotic stuff up
there like yogurts and Kim cheese that

3503
01:34:14,311 --> 01:34:16,530
they made from the farmer's market there.

3504
01:34:16,531 --> 01:34:16,980
They're good.

3505
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:20,340
It's actually important for women and
not do that like douchey and stuff that's

3506
01:34:20,341 --> 01:34:21,390
like super bad for you.

3507
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:24,740
It not amazing these to promote
that all the time girls stuff,

3508
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:25,560
they had to do it.

3509
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,790
My mom did it all the time.

3510
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:27,150
She,

3511
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:28,710
you know this because when I was a kid,

3512
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:29,591
when I was a kid,

3513
01:34:29,591 --> 01:34:30,424
I used,

3514
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,130
what's that vacuum noise

3515
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,850
opened up the Hoover dam gates of hell.

3516
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:42,840
When I was a kid I saw one of those empty
bottles in the trashcan and I used it

3517
01:34:42,841 --> 01:34:45,900
to drink koolaid out if cause I thought
it was a cool bottle cause I had that's

3518
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:46,980
cool straw thing.

3519
01:34:47,010 --> 01:34:47,960
I believe my mom,

3520
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:51,030
she never told me what it
was until like years later.

3521
01:34:51,031 --> 01:34:53,010
And then when he found out he
thought it was even cooler.

3522
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:53,311
Yeah.

3523
01:34:53,311 --> 01:34:53,990
Your mom was what?

3524
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:56,480
You were walking around the house
just sucking on your mom's douchebag.

3525
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,231
I swear to God,

3526
01:34:57,231 --> 01:34:57,711
she was like,

3527
01:34:57,711 --> 01:34:58,220
go ahead

3528
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:58,631
Brian.

3529
01:34:58,631 --> 01:34:59,520
Play outside.

3530
01:34:59,650 --> 01:35:00,483
Yeah.

3531
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:01,760
See those power lines.

3532
01:35:01,761 --> 01:35:02,594
Go climb them.

3533
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:03,740
Have here,

3534
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:05,780
have this lead paint sandwich right now.

3535
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:06,621
But,

3536
01:35:06,621 --> 01:35:07,040
uh,

3537
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:07,873
it's true story,

3538
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:08,720
you know,

3539
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:13,550
all that Douche ing and now all
that teaching has now reversed.

3540
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:14,990
It's come full,

3541
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:15,320
full,

3542
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:16,011
full frontal.

3543
01:35:16,011 --> 01:35:20,180
And where people wear it now with like
all the dragons and fucking flirting lees

3544
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:21,890
and Voluma or on their shirts,

3545
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,060
how's a Duchenne?

3546
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:23,953
Oh,

3547
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:25,083
I get it.

3548
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:25,933
Anyways,

3549
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,470
we'll do she sternal Douche.

3550
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:27,810
But,

3551
01:35:27,810 --> 01:35:28,643
uh,

3552
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:29,330
you know,

3553
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:30,163
I,

3554
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:32,750
I wanted to go somewhere where one,

3555
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:34,730
I knew there would be no,

3556
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:35,570
uh,

3557
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:37,520
issues and trying to find
people to work out with.

3558
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:39,860
And so cal is still,

3559
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:41,061
in my opinion,

3560
01:35:41,061 --> 01:35:45,200
the Mecca of MMA and
Generika and then a big guys.

3561
01:35:45,201 --> 01:35:45,411
Right?

3562
01:35:45,411 --> 01:35:46,221
And for a guy like you,

3563
01:35:46,221 --> 01:35:48,680
it's important to have history
guys to train with heavy guys,

3564
01:35:48,681 --> 01:35:49,461
quality guys,

3565
01:35:49,461 --> 01:35:49,791
you need,

3566
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:50,830
you need a whole lot of,

3567
01:35:50,831 --> 01:35:51,590
uh,

3568
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:52,550
different kinds of guys.

3569
01:35:52,610 --> 01:35:52,730
Yeah.

3570
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:55,730
You need to shave guys
that don't show y'all like,

3571
01:35:55,731 --> 01:35:56,564
sure,

3572
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:57,111
why not.

3573
01:35:57,111 --> 01:35:58,070
But for you,

3574
01:35:58,071 --> 01:35:59,960
it's really is important to have heavy,

3575
01:36:00,050 --> 01:36:00,681
good guys,

3576
01:36:00,681 --> 01:36:00,951
right?

3577
01:36:00,951 --> 01:36:02,180
Like for a guy like you,

3578
01:36:02,181 --> 01:36:04,850
like say if you're working out with a
bunch of like really good middleweights

3579
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:05,931
sounded good enough,

3580
01:36:05,931 --> 01:36:06,440
right?

3581
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:07,273
Uh,

3582
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:09,310
depends on what I'm trying to work on.

3583
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:10,550
If I'm just going against the guide,

3584
01:36:10,551 --> 01:36:13,550
it's just working on passing somebody's
guard or something like that.

3585
01:36:13,551 --> 01:36:13,731
Sure,

3586
01:36:13,731 --> 01:36:14,300
fine.

3587
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:16,010
And we're just catching a leg fine.

3588
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:18,680
But if I need to have someone to push me,

3589
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:21,380
I need someone to be able
to match me with strength,

3590
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:22,500
uh,

3591
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:23,120
weight,

3592
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,020
all that kind of stuff.

3593
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:29,840
And then Eric was down here
also everything else that
you could jump off from

3594
01:36:29,841 --> 01:36:31,160
fighting as an entertainment,

3595
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,473
uh,

3596
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:36,700
a commodity and to anything
else acting this way,

3597
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:37,401
you keep bringing that up.

3598
01:36:37,401 --> 01:36:40,990
Is that what you're trying to do
now is I have a smart dude like you,

3599
01:36:40,991 --> 01:36:42,830
you think about your athletic career,

3600
01:36:42,831 --> 01:36:43,221
you know,

3601
01:36:43,221 --> 01:36:44,270
you can't do this forever.

3602
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:49,040
Everybody's athletic window is a
very small portion of their life.

3603
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:49,963
It's important,

3604
01:36:50,210 --> 01:36:53,000
but you need to not just
be the best athlete.

3605
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:55,550
You need to grow as a person
and you need to be able to,

3606
01:36:55,551 --> 01:36:57,380
it's not about setting up plan B,

3607
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:01,130
it's about evolving as a person.

3608
01:37:01,131 --> 01:37:05,450
That's about opening new doors and doing
new things and growing and having new

3609
01:37:05,451 --> 01:37:06,141
opportunities.

3610
01:37:06,141 --> 01:37:07,790
And so I've been acting,

3611
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:08,691
uh,

3612
01:37:08,691 --> 01:37:09,710
I've done commentary.

3613
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:13,070
I'm doing commentary on new Japan
pro wrestling on access right now.

3614
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:15,200
And that's not new to me.

3615
01:37:15,201 --> 01:37:15,771
I've done,

3616
01:37:15,771 --> 01:37:17,390
I've never done progressing commentary,

3617
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:19,260
but I've done tons of fight commentary.

3618
01:37:19,261 --> 01:37:23,450
I did commentary for pride or did
commentary for some other events from

3619
01:37:23,451 --> 01:37:24,284
pancreas.

3620
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:25,243
And uh,

3621
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:26,661
it was like,

3622
01:37:26,661 --> 01:37:27,080
cool,

3623
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,310
I can do this and that's no problem.

3624
01:37:28,311 --> 01:37:30,440
Even though he kept hitting me up.

3625
01:37:30,441 --> 01:37:30,521
Well,

3626
01:37:30,521 --> 01:37:31,640
why don't you do UFC events?

3627
01:37:31,641 --> 01:37:32,330
Why don't you do this one?

3628
01:37:32,330 --> 01:37:32,580
You're like,

3629
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:33,290
well no one,

3630
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:34,011
they're not hiring me.

3631
01:37:34,011 --> 01:37:36,860
So that's why I'm not
doing commentary there.

3632
01:37:36,861 --> 01:37:39,380
And then I got the Steven
Seagal movie coming out,

3633
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:40,070
absolution.

3634
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:43,100
It should be out relatively
soon to spar with Steven Seagal.

3635
01:37:43,101 --> 01:37:44,410
And I did not have to sparse teams.

3636
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:46,520
A goal on my balls are perfectly intact.

3637
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:49,670
I didn't have any fight scenes with him.

3638
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:52,730
I just scenes with him
acting scenes and not really,

3639
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:53,670
uh,

3640
01:37:53,670 --> 01:37:53,970
he,

3641
01:37:53,970 --> 01:37:56,070
he was in a scene where
I'm in the background.

3642
01:37:56,071 --> 01:37:57,420
I just end up getting
into a fight with him,

3643
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,070
with his sidekick guy.

3644
01:37:59,071 --> 01:37:59,640
Anyways,

3645
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,440
so I give that dude his hero moment,

3646
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:03,720
a by run man who did a great job.

3647
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:04,890
Uh,

3648
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:08,010
and I've got another movie that should
be coming out sometime this year called

3649
01:38:08,011 --> 01:38:09,480
chuck Hank and the San Diego twins.

3650
01:38:09,481 --> 01:38:10,291
It's an indie film.

3651
01:38:10,291 --> 01:38:12,600
It's fucking completely insane.

3652
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:17,010
So how do you balance that between
training or you like leaning more towards

3653
01:38:17,011 --> 01:38:17,700
that area now?

3654
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:19,450
You haven't fought since
the Travis Brown fight,

3655
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:20,303
right?

3656
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:22,163
Last year,

3657
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,330
2014 December.

3658
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:25,270
Do you have anything on your,

3659
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:26,760
on your plate right now?

3660
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:31,530
I'm hoping I at some point to get a
word on whether or not I'm fighting Roy

3661
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:32,850
Nelson because we,

3662
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:33,811
it was brought up,

3663
01:38:33,811 --> 01:38:35,160
someone brought up the idea of,

3664
01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:35,400
uh,

3665
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,900
Roy and me doing metamorris.

3666
01:38:36,930 --> 01:38:37,081
Yeah,

3667
01:38:37,081 --> 01:38:38,010
that's what I've kind of had to,

3668
01:38:38,011 --> 01:38:38,400
it was like,

3669
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:38,510
oh,

3670
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:39,031
okay.

3671
01:38:39,031 --> 01:38:39,451
Really?

3672
01:38:39,451 --> 01:38:41,160
And then Roy said,

3673
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:41,700
Nah,

3674
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:42,540
that sounds cool,

3675
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:43,620
but we fight first,

3676
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:44,813
pays better.

3677
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:45,300
And how I had,

3678
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:46,020
well,

3679
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:46,651
if you're willing,

3680
01:38:46,651 --> 01:38:47,484
I'm willing.

3681
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:48,240
And he said,

3682
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:48,511
good,

3683
01:38:48,511 --> 01:38:49,440
let's make it happen.

3684
01:38:49,510 --> 01:38:49,771
I said,

3685
01:38:49,771 --> 01:38:50,310
well,

3686
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:51,180
I guess that's that.

3687
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:52,110
If we say we're going to,

3688
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:54,090
we're willing to fight and
we're ready to step up and go,

3689
01:38:54,091 --> 01:38:55,350
then you know what's legit.

3690
01:38:55,590 --> 01:38:59,050
And have there been any conversations
with Joe Silva or the highly,

3691
01:38:59,190 --> 01:39:01,050
I imagine my manager's
the one with all of that,

3692
01:39:01,051 --> 01:39:01,710
but I'll show you.

3693
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:05,910
You have your manager was informed
of all this stuff and hey,

3694
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:06,983
go deal with that.

3695
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:07,310
Yeah,

3696
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:09,060
but I gotta Act pretty much.

3697
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:09,530
I got,

3698
01:39:09,530 --> 01:39:10,710
I gotta hit acting class.

3699
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:15,300
You wouldn't be opposed to doing
a metamorris with him though?

3700
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:15,811
No,

3701
01:39:15,811 --> 01:39:17,820
I'm not opposed to doing
a metamorris with anybody.

3702
01:39:17,821 --> 01:39:18,654
I think.

3703
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:23,670
I don't think I'll ever get a chance to
finish the rubber match with Nogueira.

3704
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:24,781
Uh,

3705
01:39:24,781 --> 01:39:27,630
but I could at least probably get
him on the mat and Metamorris.

3706
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:28,793
Do you think so?

3707
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:29,551
I think so.

3708
01:39:29,551 --> 01:39:29,821
I mean,

3709
01:39:29,821 --> 01:39:32,700
I don't see why he wouldn't want to do
it and why people wouldn't want to see

3710
01:39:32,701 --> 01:39:33,330
that.

3711
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:35,660
But I've already got a brain.

3712
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,920
You cyborg coming up.

3713
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:38,610
Uh,

3714
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:39,360
May 9th.

3715
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,920
That's a more interesting,

3716
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:41,970
that's very interesting.

3717
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:43,890
Especially after you just
submit a dean lister.

3718
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:45,390
That's very huge dude.

3719
01:39:45,391 --> 01:39:48,240
Submitting Dean lister is
a gigantic accomplishment.

3720
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:49,920
It hadn't been done in 16 years.

3721
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:53,730
That's amazing that since the Clinton
administration had anybody tap dean lister

3722
01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:55,080
and the way you got them,

3723
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:56,190
would that choke?

3724
01:39:56,191 --> 01:39:57,020
I mean that's,

3725
01:39:57,020 --> 01:40:00,030
that is some old school shit that's,

3726
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,050
that's high school wrestling.

3727
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,311
Yeah.

3728
01:40:02,311 --> 01:40:07,311
And with wrestling shoes on and the old
school spandex stuff sexy spend x man,

3729
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,990
pull up the photo of Josh Barnett.

3730
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:10,381
No.

3731
01:40:10,381 --> 01:40:10,681
Would you,

3732
01:40:10,681 --> 01:40:14,070
did you wear this Josh Bartlett
and he's in Baltimore eyes less.

3733
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:14,821
You eat less.

3734
01:40:14,821 --> 01:40:16,690
You'd like your panties to catch fire,

3735
01:40:16,691 --> 01:40:19,590
your vagina's for a fury of hormones.

3736
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:24,210
Did you wear this like as a a
like an homage to pro wrestling?

3737
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:27,450
Absolutely is an homage to my trainers.

3738
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:27,900
Uh,

3739
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:28,950
Billy Robinson,

3740
01:40:28,951 --> 01:40:29,820
Karl Gotch,

3741
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:30,721
uh,

3742
01:40:30,721 --> 01:40:33,750
and and also to Eric cause that's
from his roots and Matt Hume.

3743
01:40:33,751 --> 01:40:34,560
But uh,

3744
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,311
from my training,

3745
01:40:35,311 --> 01:40:35,860
my roots,

3746
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:36,361
my heritage,

3747
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:41,361
my catch wrestling training and to Antonio
and Oakey who was one of my trainers

3748
01:40:41,851 --> 01:40:43,020
for professional wrestling.

3749
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:46,170
So I had the towel around my neck,

3750
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:46,890
the robe,

3751
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:49,400
even the way I took the
robe off and there was all,

3752
01:40:49,401 --> 01:40:49,831
all of that.

3753
01:40:49,831 --> 01:40:50,581
The black boots,

3754
01:40:50,581 --> 01:40:51,600
it's all black.

3755
01:40:51,601 --> 01:40:53,620
It's all in Oman.

3756
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:54,370
And respect

3757
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:55,203
to my,

3758
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:56,890
my catch wrestling roots and my trainers.

3759
01:40:56,910 --> 01:40:57,370
Well it's,

3760
01:40:57,370 --> 01:41:01,480
I think it's important to highlight those
roots to for the just the lineage of

3761
01:41:01,481 --> 01:41:06,481
MMA because a lot of folks that are on
the outside are not aware that there were

3762
01:41:07,001 --> 01:41:09,970
several different branches
of submission fighting,

3763
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:10,541
you know,

3764
01:41:10,541 --> 01:41:11,650
not just judo,

3765
01:41:11,651 --> 01:41:13,110
not just Jujitsu notches.

3766
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:18,250
Sambo catch wrestling had some really
legit submissions that are still used

3767
01:41:19,001 --> 01:41:24,001
today and a lot of really great grapplers
but catch wrestling eventually sort of

3768
01:41:25,091 --> 01:41:29,830
morphed into professional wrestling
and a lot of folks are not aware of the

3769
01:41:29,831 --> 01:41:31,720
original aspect of catch wrestling,

3770
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:36,100
which we're talking about these three
hour matches and guys that would go to,

3771
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:40,660
they would do carnival matches where they
would go roll into town and wrestling.

3772
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:42,850
You who owned a big
old carnival in Brazil,

3773
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:43,720
who?

3774
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:45,730
The head of the Gracie family at the time.

3775
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:47,013
Good style.

3776
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:47,500
Really.

3777
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:51,870
He owned a carnival and he
had professional wrestling
catch wrestling matches at

3778
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:56,880
his carnival who should happen to
come and perform in one of these catch

3779
01:41:57,041 --> 01:41:57,880
wrestling matches.

3780
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:01,220
But the account coma Mitsui [inaudible],

3781
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:03,250
he stayed in Brazil.

3782
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:07,210
Carlos Gracie started training
under him in judo and catch,

3783
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:09,500
uh,

3784
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:13,480
is where now all of a sudden
you have Gracie Jujitsu.

3785
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:17,050
So it's sort of branched off from
a bunch of different sources,

3786
01:42:17,051 --> 01:42:20,090
not just from judo but don't catch
wrestling as well because my,

3787
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:23,110
I had been traveling the world competing
and catch matches and all that.

3788
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:26,050
Kimora competed in catch matches as well.

3789
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:31,680
So even though the Americana arm lock
came from American wrestlers catch,

3790
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:37,060
they allude to leave ray background
comes from catch a tattoo,

3791
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:37,871
a Ukulele,

3792
01:42:37,871 --> 01:42:39,000
these hot them,

3793
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:40,840
he was a catch wrestler.

3794
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:42,850
He was trained to do show matches,

3795
01:42:42,851 --> 01:42:44,380
but at the same time he trained,

3796
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:45,310
even back then,

3797
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:46,990
even if you did works,

3798
01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:48,370
you trained as a shooter,

3799
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,810
you trained to do that shit for real.

3800
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:52,960
Look at this beautiful
outfit and a mother Fucker,

3801
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:53,620
uh,

3802
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:54,071
comes out,

3803
01:42:54,071 --> 01:42:54,210
right.

3804
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:55,390
The robe on.

3805
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:57,850
This is so old school view,

3806
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:59,660
look at this to do this.

3807
01:42:59,661 --> 01:43:04,040
And metamorris he almost had to feel like
you're kind of wearing like a costume.

3808
01:43:05,090 --> 01:43:05,241
Yeah,

3809
01:43:05,241 --> 01:43:07,220
I knew that people would be unfamiliar.

3810
01:43:07,221 --> 01:43:08,360
They wouldn't understand it,

3811
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:10,250
but people did understand it though.

3812
01:43:10,251 --> 01:43:11,360
A lot of people in the underground,

3813
01:43:11,361 --> 01:43:12,260
especially with like,

3814
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:12,741
no,

3815
01:43:12,741 --> 01:43:14,240
those socks are for,

3816
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:14,800
uh,

3817
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,180
in reference to all my
time spent in Japan.

3818
01:43:17,181 --> 01:43:18,500
And uh,

3819
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:19,431
you know,

3820
01:43:19,431 --> 01:43:20,780
the people I've trained over there.

3821
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:21,733
Uh,

3822
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:22,933
but uh,

3823
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:24,643
they uh,

3824
01:43:25,410 --> 01:43:25,670
uh,

3825
01:43:25,670 --> 01:43:25,971
you know,

3826
01:43:25,971 --> 01:43:26,091
they,

3827
01:43:26,091 --> 01:43:28,400
they've paid laughed when I said
I'm just going to wear shoes.

3828
01:43:28,401 --> 01:43:28,611
They're like,

3829
01:43:28,611 --> 01:43:29,181
oh my God,

3830
01:43:29,181 --> 01:43:30,920
you're going to wear
choosing as dean lister.

3831
01:43:31,190 --> 01:43:31,551
Oh,

3832
01:43:31,551 --> 01:43:32,220
you're Stan.

3833
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,350
I don't think you should do this.

3834
01:43:33,351 --> 01:43:34,760
Or as a leg lock specialist,

3835
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:35,060
right.

3836
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:38,570
To provide a lot of extra traction
for holding all this stuff about,

3837
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:39,081
oh,

3838
01:43:39,081 --> 01:43:39,920
I can't believe we're going to work.

3839
01:43:39,970 --> 01:43:42,230
Are you still going to do up until the
day of the event you're really going to

3840
01:43:42,231 --> 01:43:42,980
wear shoes?

3841
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:43,813
Yes.

3842
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:44,931
I go out there.

3843
01:43:44,931 --> 01:43:45,764
I tap him.

3844
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,290
Although his shoes that
gave him such an advantage.

3845
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:48,870
Oh,

3846
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:49,431
I'll fuck.

3847
01:43:49,431 --> 01:43:50,750
Are you kidding me now?

3848
01:43:50,751 --> 01:43:52,550
The are not my detriment

3849
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:52,761
there.

3850
01:43:52,761 --> 01:43:53,630
My disadvantage.

3851
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:53,781
Oh,

3852
01:43:53,781 --> 01:43:54,614
and then it was,

3853
01:43:54,710 --> 01:43:56,270
you weighed so much more than dean.

3854
01:43:56,271 --> 01:43:57,440
Dean was like two 40.

3855
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:58,820
Now I don't,

3856
01:43:58,820 --> 01:43:59,061
I don't know.

3857
01:43:59,061 --> 01:43:59,930
I was like two 55,

3858
01:43:59,931 --> 01:44:01,040
so I had 15 pounds on him.

3859
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:02,210
I hug.

3860
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:06,260
I gave Dina hug the day of the weigh
ins while we didn't actually weigh in,

3861
01:44:06,261 --> 01:44:09,170
but I gave him a hug and my fingers.

3862
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:13,850
I had to go catch fingers and roll my
grip into it to actually get all the way

3863
01:44:13,851 --> 01:44:14,380
around us.

3864
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:15,830
It was so fucking thick.

3865
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:18,380
He's a big fucker thick and veiny purple.

3866
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:19,523
Whoa.

3867
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:20,503
Slow down.

3868
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:22,790
You want to help me on
my throbbing ground game?

3869
01:44:22,791 --> 01:44:23,121
Yeah,

3870
01:44:23,121 --> 01:44:23,630
sure,

3871
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:24,290
sure.

3872
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:25,610
That what they bought it these days.

3873
01:44:26,220 --> 01:44:26,800
Uh,

3874
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,780
D was a big massive guy
when he fought Babaloo.

3875
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:34,530
I was really shocked that he was like
allowing almost Bob Ballou to lock up

3876
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:36,260
Darcy's on them like,

3877
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:38,910
like Baba lose a really
good submission guy.

3878
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:43,130
He is excellent and he's just so
smiley at getting out all that stuff.

3879
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,300
I was shocked.

3880
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:45,950
I was shocked that he was allowing that,

3881
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:50,240
but it also looked like he didn't
have the gas to go a full 20 like,

3882
01:44:50,241 --> 01:44:50,420
you know,

3883
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:54,110
Bob a loo at the end of the match
was in way better shape and dean was,

3884
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:54,741
I agreed.

3885
01:44:54,741 --> 01:44:56,150
Herring around all that muscle,

3886
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:57,330
all that mass that he carry.

3887
01:44:57,331 --> 01:44:57,431
Well,

3888
01:44:57,431 --> 01:44:58,670
you're a bigger guy.

3889
01:44:58,810 --> 01:45:02,240
Like he might be two 40 but a lot
of that is Mexican supplements.

3890
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:06,580
There's a big difference between
your two 40 and his two fort.

3891
01:45:06,730 --> 01:45:07,380
I'm saying like,

3892
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:07,550
no,

3893
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:09,050
I mean I think avocado,

3894
01:45:09,130 --> 01:45:10,250
a hot sauce,

3895
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,740
you know that stuff has done wonders.

3896
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:13,160
Fine.

3897
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:14,860
Speaking of different supplements,

3898
01:45:14,870 --> 01:45:15,703
sir,

3899
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:19,940
but I mean the green sauce,

3900
01:45:19,941 --> 01:45:22,190
he's so skilled and talented too.

3901
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:24,350
I mean it's not just all the extra muscle.

3902
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:27,860
He was strong as shit when I wrestled
him and apparently his guys and him,

3903
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:30,350
Dean said he wrestled a lot of big dudes.

3904
01:45:30,650 --> 01:45:35,030
They wrestled against guys for pressure
from top and it's just that I was able

3905
01:45:35,031 --> 01:45:36,650
to apply it that much better.

3906
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:38,870
Did you think that you are going to
be able to catch him with that choke?

3907
01:45:38,871 --> 01:45:40,880
Was that something specifically
that you had saw before?

3908
01:45:40,881 --> 01:45:41,660
Did you game plan?

3909
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:41,901
Well,

3910
01:45:41,901 --> 01:45:42,111
yeah.

3911
01:45:42,111 --> 01:45:45,080
Well Rica Rodriguez was the
last guy to tap him for that.

3912
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:46,970
And how would it happen with Same Cho?

3913
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:47,863
Exactly.

3914
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,310
You know who taught Rico the choked,

3915
01:45:49,311 --> 01:45:50,100
by the way?

3916
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:50,933
Eric Paulson,

3917
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:53,150
I'll fucking boxing
works in Redondo beach.

3918
01:45:53,151 --> 01:45:53,930
Yes,

3919
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:54,763
absolutely.

3920
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:55,490
Yeah.

3921
01:45:55,490 --> 01:45:56,360
God Damn.

3922
01:45:56,670 --> 01:45:56,960
You know,

3923
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,550
I remember first hearing about,

3924
01:45:58,590 --> 01:45:58,820
uh,

3925
01:45:58,820 --> 01:45:59,660
catch wrestling.

3926
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:00,890
Was it frank gotch?

3927
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,210
Was he the one that would drop?

3928
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:02,541
No.

3929
01:46:02,541 --> 01:46:04,010
Who was the guy that would drop down?

3930
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,420
It was a sh a small dude.

3931
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:06,500
What the fuck was his name?

3932
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:07,830
God dammit.

3933
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:09,980
I'm so catch wrestler.

3934
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:12,860
Was that who the guy
was that used to drop a,

3935
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:14,790
he used to do like hangman's drops.

3936
01:46:14,830 --> 01:46:17,590
So that is farmer burns
from Martin's farmer.

3937
01:46:17,591 --> 01:46:20,570
Burns' farmer bro is
framed in there somewhere.

3938
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,433
It's farmer.

3939
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:21,951
Yeah.

3940
01:46:21,951 --> 01:46:26,930
He can hang himself and not break
his neck is there's pictures of it.

3941
01:46:26,931 --> 01:46:27,500
Look up,

3942
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:30,320
look up farmer Burns'
catch wrestling image.

3943
01:46:30,321 --> 01:46:33,050
See if you find an image of this
guy fucking hanging himself.

3944
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:33,913
It's morbid.

3945
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:34,371
Yeah.

3946
01:46:34,371 --> 01:46:34,850
Look at that.

3947
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:35,450
Look at that.

3948
01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:36,800
Look at that fucking picture.

3949
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:38,690
The guy hung himself.

3950
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,790
That's how strong his fucking neck was.

3951
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:46,340
He would hang his whole probably really
good for decompression of the spine.

3952
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:51,120
I actually do a thing in my house where
I probably jerking off at the same,

3953
01:46:51,190 --> 01:46:51,700
oh,

3954
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:52,770
I wear a wet suit.

3955
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,000
There's a black dildo.

3956
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:55,290
I have this,

3957
01:46:55,291 --> 01:46:55,770
um,

3958
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:59,670
this thing that I bought
a spinal decompression set
up that hangs from a door.

3959
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:02,160
You put it on the door
like a bathroom door.

3960
01:47:02,161 --> 01:47:03,870
It's like at this bolt screws and place,

3961
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:06,450
it has like an arm and
then you ratchet it,

3962
01:47:06,451 --> 01:47:06,841
like click,

3963
01:47:06,841 --> 01:47:08,880
click and it like decompress your spine.

3964
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:10,080
It's like a nice little stretch,

3965
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:10,560
right?

3966
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,393
This motherfucker,

3967
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:11,880
David,

3968
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:12,960
David Carradine did too.

3969
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:15,010
I don't think that the same.

3970
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:16,980
I think what he did was different.

3971
01:47:16,981 --> 01:47:18,850
How does that not just rip
your door off the hill?

3972
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:20,730
Cause you're not really putting
your whole weight on it.

3973
01:47:20,731 --> 01:47:21,481
You're sitting down.

3974
01:47:21,481 --> 01:47:21,931
First of all,

3975
01:47:21,931 --> 01:47:22,890
you do it in a chair.

3976
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:23,880
Like say this thing,

3977
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:25,500
it's velcroed into your head here.

3978
01:47:25,501 --> 01:47:25,741
Like,

3979
01:47:25,741 --> 01:47:26,520
um,

3980
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,360
I know what you're talking about.

3981
01:47:27,361 --> 01:47:28,020
You know what I'm talking about.

3982
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:28,251
And you do,

3983
01:47:28,251 --> 01:47:29,130
you know what you're talking about.

3984
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:29,671
And it's,

3985
01:47:29,671 --> 01:47:30,320
uh,

3986
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,130
I think if you can use it properly,

3987
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:32,990
uh,

3988
01:47:32,990 --> 01:47:33,140
it,

3989
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:33,490
it,

3990
01:47:33,490 --> 01:47:34,170
it's a good,

3991
01:47:34,170 --> 01:47:35,003
it's a good thing.

3992
01:47:35,170 --> 01:47:37,020
Having the spinal
decompression is important.

3993
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:38,363
Uh,

3994
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:40,950
but what he was doing was not,

3995
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:41,640
no.

3996
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:43,290
And that's why the fuck was insane.

3997
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:44,153
And uh,

3998
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:44,761
you know,

3999
01:47:44,761 --> 01:47:45,241
catch,

4000
01:47:45,241 --> 01:47:48,690
catch wrestlers trained fucking
hardest shit does Brian.

4001
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:49,381
No,

4002
01:47:49,381 --> 01:47:50,320
that's not it changed.

4003
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:51,373
Fuck.

4004
01:47:52,070 --> 01:47:52,680
See this.

4005
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:53,520
Oh Wow.

4006
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:54,360
So this thing,

4007
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:54,691
yeah,

4008
01:47:54,691 --> 01:47:55,321
that's crazy.

4009
01:47:55,321 --> 01:47:55,770
That's,

4010
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:56,940
that's exactly what it is.

4011
01:47:57,690 --> 01:47:59,550
His face looks just like
that when he does it too.

4012
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:04,630
It's stretches your neck a little bit
cracked around your job's not what it is.

4013
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:06,540
It's more like a bra,

4014
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,273
like a Bra.

4015
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:09,180
Oh God.

4016
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:11,490
I've pissed off so many
women when I've said,

4017
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:12,060
oh,

4018
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:12,600
hey,

4019
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:13,130
whatever,

4020
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:13,560
uh,

4021
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:13,741
blah,

4022
01:48:13,741 --> 01:48:13,861
blah,

4023
01:48:13,861 --> 01:48:14,080
blah.

4024
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:16,800
Don't forget your training bra training.

4025
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:17,251
Training,

4026
01:48:17,251 --> 01:48:19,030
like training newsletters.

4027
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:19,291
Yeah,

4028
01:48:19,291 --> 01:48:19,511
no,

4029
01:48:19,511 --> 01:48:20,344
I didn't mean,

4030
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:20,761
yeah,

4031
01:48:20,761 --> 01:48:21,451
you can't say that.

4032
01:48:21,451 --> 01:48:22,231
I just get the evil.

4033
01:48:22,231 --> 01:48:22,801
Look I didn't like,

4034
01:48:22,801 --> 01:48:27,801
I don't mean like you
have new tits meant Bra.

4035
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:29,093
When you train,

4036
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:30,890
what do they call one
of those sports bras?

4037
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:31,873
Sports Bra.

4038
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:32,970
Now you've got training Bra.

4039
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:33,863
You gotta be real.

4040
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:35,790
It is a bra that you train in.

4041
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:37,301
That's not how they look.

4042
01:48:37,301 --> 01:48:38,040
Not a training bra.

4043
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:39,180
It's a very different animal.

4044
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:44,240
It will get you all kinds of heat
can get upset if training underwear.

4045
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:46,160
What have you seen?

4046
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:46,531
I love,

4047
01:48:46,531 --> 01:48:48,470
you said get your go eat a training bra.

4048
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:48,910
He's like,

4049
01:48:48,910 --> 01:48:49,743
what?

4050
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:49,951
Yeah,

4051
01:48:49,951 --> 01:48:50,760
but then you told the guy,

4052
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:52,260
go pick up your training cup.

4053
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:56,040
Oh my Dick's growing.

4054
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:58,680
I get to used to wearing a cup.

4055
01:48:59,170 --> 01:49:01,050
You need support and all the right places.

4056
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:01,560
You know,

4057
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:04,350
this is a very random question that
was very specific or I should say,

4058
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:08,000
what do you think about a tie steel
cups for grappling competition.

4059
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:12,150
So they're getting outlawed and a lot
of grappling competitions because they

4060
01:49:12,151 --> 01:49:13,560
provide that extra leverage.

4061
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:15,300
They're like a fulcrum point,

4062
01:49:15,330 --> 01:49:16,380
like a leverage point.

4063
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:17,470
Okay Lynn.

4064
01:49:17,470 --> 01:49:18,930
And then everybody's got a free ball,

4065
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:20,580
three ball.

4066
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:21,010
You know,

4067
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:25,160
you just gotta use that Third Hook
wrap your Dyngus around there.

4068
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:27,660
You see we bring Brian on.

4069
01:49:27,661 --> 01:49:28,381
These podcasts are,

4070
01:49:28,381 --> 01:49:29,430
wouldn't goes in the fucking,

4071
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:29,671
well,

4072
01:49:29,671 --> 01:49:30,100
here's the,

4073
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:30,720
here's the thing,

4074
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:31,261
here's the no,

4075
01:49:31,261 --> 01:49:32,160
I mean I'm here.

4076
01:49:32,161 --> 01:49:33,780
I'm barely 11 and a half,

4077
01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:35,610
so I wouldn't have,

4078
01:49:35,611 --> 01:49:35,910
I don't,

4079
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:37,590
I usually don't train with a cup.

4080
01:49:37,950 --> 01:49:42,780
You don't know because my
legs are so big that it's,

4081
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,890
it rubs with bruising in the,

4082
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:46,050
in the inside of my thighs.

4083
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:48,011
I personally,

4084
01:49:48,011 --> 01:49:52,650
I have a thing I like to call combat
cock where everything just pulls it zen.

4085
01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:53,150
Yeah.

4086
01:49:53,150 --> 01:49:56,320
Do you remember those guys knows better
than to get fucking hanging out there.

4087
01:49:56,321 --> 01:49:56,531
Hey,

4088
01:49:56,531 --> 01:49:57,191
how you doing?

4089
01:49:57,191 --> 01:49:57,641
What's up?

4090
01:49:57,641 --> 01:49:57,821
High?

4091
01:49:57,821 --> 01:49:59,470
Five is educated.

4092
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,400
My Dick is smart.

4093
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:01,720
Just like the Shaolin Monks.

4094
01:50:01,721 --> 01:50:03,550
I've known guys have
lost a ball from that.

4095
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:04,180
Ah,

4096
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:04,690
not me.

4097
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:04,931
Yeah.

4098
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:06,090
Well there's Brian Foster's.

4099
01:50:06,091 --> 01:50:06,341
I was,

4100
01:50:06,341 --> 01:50:06,701
it was,

4101
01:50:06,701 --> 01:50:07,890
it was my father's TFC.

4102
01:50:08,190 --> 01:50:08,740
Oh,

4103
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:10,990
is in training and he got kicked
in the balls and last one.

4104
01:50:10,991 --> 01:50:11,824
It was balls.

4105
01:50:11,850 --> 01:50:12,520
Yeah.

4106
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:13,630
Did you ever find it Dick?

4107
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:15,290
Just stupid Dick.

4108
01:50:16,450 --> 01:50:17,650
Terrible decisions.

4109
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:18,750
What's going on?

4110
01:50:19,810 --> 01:50:20,100
Yeah.

4111
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:21,160
His Dick is always like,

4112
01:50:21,161 --> 01:50:21,740
what are you doing?

4113
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:23,170
Have you seen where his dick as Ben?

4114
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:24,181
Can you imagine it?

4115
01:50:24,181 --> 01:50:24,710
Does Dick's a lot?

4116
01:50:24,710 --> 01:50:25,543
Need to be alive?

4117
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:27,460
Yes,

4118
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:28,293
I have.

4119
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:30,310
I've seen like pictures.

4120
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:30,550
Oh,

4121
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:31,450
you've been in the room?

4122
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:32,353
Oh fuck.

4123
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:34,530
You know what?

4124
01:50:34,530 --> 01:50:35,620
I'm after he over,

4125
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:37,420
he just want to take like a whole,

4126
01:50:37,421 --> 01:50:38,470
like a bottle of paint.

4127
01:50:38,471 --> 01:50:38,921
Then I'd be like,

4128
01:50:38,921 --> 01:50:40,960
you need to just dip in this real quick.

4129
01:50:41,110 --> 01:50:42,400
Did you guys see that thing?

4130
01:50:42,401 --> 01:50:47,401
There was a fucking guy who is a scientist
for Monsanto and was trying to say

4131
01:50:47,741 --> 01:50:48,190
that,

4132
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:49,060
pull it off of my,

4133
01:50:49,061 --> 01:50:49,840
um,

4134
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:50,560
my youtube,

4135
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:50,781
uh,

4136
01:50:50,781 --> 01:50:51,041
my,

4137
01:50:51,041 --> 01:50:51,120
uh,

4138
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:52,150
rather and my Twitter feed.

4139
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:53,350
This is hilarious.

4140
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:54,370
I retweeted it.

4141
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:54,670
This,

4142
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:58,000
this fucking Monsanto scientist
was trying to say that,

4143
01:50:58,030 --> 01:50:58,510
um,

4144
01:50:58,510 --> 01:51:01,990
this pesticide was totally safe to drink.

4145
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:05,420
Just stuff that's in roundup and then
you could drink it and nothing that the

4146
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:06,521
toys or whatever.

4147
01:51:06,521 --> 01:51:07,730
So there's a video of him.

4148
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:08,501
Second Idiot.

4149
01:51:08,501 --> 01:51:09,600
And so he's talking to this dot.

4150
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:10,031
This,

4151
01:51:10,031 --> 01:51:10,660
uh,

4152
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:12,670
this journalist and the
journalist who's a really,

4153
01:51:12,671 --> 01:51:13,011
you,

4154
01:51:13,011 --> 01:51:13,800
you would drink it.

4155
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:14,051
He goes,

4156
01:51:14,051 --> 01:51:14,501
sure,

4157
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:15,250
I would drink it.

4158
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:15,551
He goes,

4159
01:51:15,551 --> 01:51:15,770
okay,

4160
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:16,810
we're going to get your glass.

4161
01:51:16,811 --> 01:51:17,644
And you drank it.

4162
01:51:17,650 --> 01:51:17,831
Like,

4163
01:51:17,831 --> 01:51:18,664
watch this.

4164
01:51:18,930 --> 01:51:21,010
Gmo Advocates as Montana,

4165
01:51:21,070 --> 01:51:23,440
Monsanto or herbicide is safe to drink.

4166
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:24,820
It's behind too many products.

4167
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:26,230
The Canadians might know it.

4168
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:28,600
Its roundup weed killer is that,

4169
01:51:28,601 --> 01:51:30,370
has glyphosate is a chemical,

4170
01:51:30,371 --> 01:51:30,830
that's it.

4171
01:51:30,830 --> 01:51:32,590
Glyophosphate quite faucet.

4172
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:33,813
Watch this shit.

4173
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:35,860
Deformities in children
growing into countries,

4174
01:51:35,890 --> 01:51:37,030
agricultural region.

4175
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:42,060
Monsanto has denied any wrongdoing and
that the product is safe and that's where

4176
01:51:42,061 --> 01:51:46,320
Dr. Patrick Moore comes in and Monsanto
lobbyists sat down with French cable

4177
01:51:46,321 --> 01:51:50,040
channels can now plus more said you
could drink an entire quarter of this

4178
01:51:50,041 --> 01:51:50,874
product.

4179
01:51:51,010 --> 01:51:53,920
Her ears sports drink a whole
quarter of it and it won't hurt you.

4180
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,780
It's you want to drink some?

4181
01:51:55,781 --> 01:51:56,590
We have some here.

4182
01:51:56,590 --> 01:51:57,820
I'd be happy to actually,

4183
01:51:58,270 --> 01:51:58,600
no,

4184
01:51:58,600 --> 01:51:59,171
not really,

4185
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:00,140
but not really.

4186
01:52:00,141 --> 01:52:01,010
I know me.

4187
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:04,960
That's when the interviewer asked more
to put his money where his mouth was and

4188
01:52:04,961 --> 01:52:05,890
drink the weed killer.

4189
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:06,191
Okay.

4190
01:52:06,191 --> 01:52:07,024
Then it's finished.

4191
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:10,760
Then the interview is finished and
say this is a good way to sell thing.

4192
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:11,653
Yeah.

4193
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:13,560
Complete Chirp.

4194
01:52:13,950 --> 01:52:15,670
Why did this complete check?

4195
01:52:15,671 --> 01:52:16,690
Did you order something?

4196
01:52:17,110 --> 01:52:20,600
Apparently it was a complete
jerk and franchise canard.

4197
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:22,900
Is this the one that
was on my Twitter feed?

4198
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:23,770
Hey,

4199
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:25,780
maybe I watched more
than one version of this,

4200
01:52:25,781 --> 01:52:28,490
but the conversation lasted a
little longer than that as fucking,

4201
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:31,240
that appears to be a lying piece of shit.

4202
01:52:31,241 --> 01:52:31,481
Yeah,

4203
01:52:31,481 --> 01:52:32,290
an amazing,

4204
01:52:32,290 --> 01:52:32,831
and he was like,

4205
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:33,664
I would drink it.

4206
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:34,391
Okay.

4207
01:52:34,391 --> 01:52:35,170
You want to drink it?

4208
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:35,800
No,

4209
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:39,680
you're a complete jerk
completers Starmie call.

4210
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:40,300
Nah,

4211
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:41,200
that guy's a doctor.

4212
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:43,510
How fucking stupid can you be when you,

4213
01:52:43,511 --> 01:52:44,470
you go to school,

4214
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,380
you're a doctor,

4215
01:52:45,381 --> 01:52:46,250
you get a degree

4216
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:49,790
and then you're smart enough
where you get hired by Monsanto.

4217
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:53,660
You're smart enough where
you do interviews and you
expect it to be an expert

4218
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:55,100
but you're so fucking stupid.

4219
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:56,360
You say something like,

4220
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:57,320
oh you could drink it.

4221
01:52:57,321 --> 01:52:58,154
I would drink it.

4222
01:52:58,360 --> 01:52:59,181
He would drink it.

4223
01:52:59,181 --> 01:53:02,300
We have something stupid or do you think
he's just being a piece of shit and

4224
01:53:02,301 --> 01:53:04,070
trying to lie for Monsanto?

4225
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:04,910
I think both.

4226
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:08,550
Did they go into it and go like we broke
down the chemicals in this [inaudible]

4227
01:53:08,570 --> 01:53:09,740
actually be safe.

4228
01:53:09,741 --> 01:53:11,900
Like did they expand that at all?

4229
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:15,950
Because a lot of those things like
the real issue is prolonged exposure.

4230
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:20,600
Like I know a dude who has bone cancer
and he got bone cancer because his family

4231
01:53:20,601 --> 01:53:24,980
lived near a golf course and the golf
course used a lot of pesticides and

4232
01:53:24,981 --> 01:53:28,460
infected the well water and all the kids
in the neighborhood guide cancer too.

4233
01:53:28,650 --> 01:53:30,680
Like his next door neighbor got cancer,

4234
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:32,300
has the duty lived across the street,

4235
01:53:32,301 --> 01:53:32,970
got cancer.

4236
01:53:32,970 --> 01:53:35,090
So important to keep
that grass nice and lush.

4237
01:53:35,091 --> 01:53:35,271
Right?

4238
01:53:35,271 --> 01:53:36,230
I don't think they knew.

4239
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,930
I think there's a lot of carcinogen.

4240
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:42,020
I'll give him that and that back in
the day they didn't understand how

4241
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:43,850
potentially hazardous uh,

4242
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:47,300
longterm effects versus
short term could be.

4243
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:51,050
Even though they didn't really know how
bad cigarettes were entirely at a point.

4244
01:53:51,051 --> 01:53:52,760
But then it came a point
that they did know,

4245
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:55,370
I mean cigarettes still blow me away.

4246
01:53:55,490 --> 01:53:55,730
Yeah.

4247
01:53:55,730 --> 01:53:57,970
Why do you add the shit in
all the poisons and stuff?

4248
01:53:58,010 --> 01:53:58,521
It's okay.

4249
01:53:58,521 --> 01:53:58,671
You're,

4250
01:53:58,671 --> 01:53:58,911
you're,

4251
01:53:58,911 --> 01:54:00,380
you're inhaling smoke,

4252
01:54:00,381 --> 01:54:00,681
which is,

4253
01:54:00,681 --> 01:54:01,514
we all know is bad.

4254
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:02,930
You can die from smoke inhalation.

4255
01:54:02,931 --> 01:54:04,280
It's carcinogens or in their car.

4256
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:04,940
Fine,

4257
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:05,773
we got it.

4258
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:08,630
Do you have to add all the
other crap that's in it?

4259
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:11,120
They had all of our Schick
and all this garbage.

4260
01:54:11,121 --> 01:54:11,990
Like just to get you more,

4261
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:16,970
why don't you just just give him the
fucking leaf to be a weed or be it fucking

4262
01:54:16,971 --> 01:54:17,421
tobacco.

4263
01:54:17,421 --> 01:54:18,260
Just let him smoke it.

4264
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:19,730
Let them know what's going to happen.

4265
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:21,260
But you don't have to help them.

4266
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:23,030
You don't have to fuck and add rat poison,

4267
01:54:23,370 --> 01:54:26,760
try American spirits and compare
it to like a Marlboro light.

4268
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:30,030
I don't huge difference in
the taste and everything,

4269
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:31,050
but yeah,

4270
01:54:31,051 --> 01:54:31,501
it's,

4271
01:54:31,501 --> 01:54:32,281
they shouldn't do it,

4272
01:54:32,281 --> 01:54:32,761
but okay.

4273
01:54:32,761 --> 01:54:33,840
So kind of playing to us.

4274
01:54:33,930 --> 01:54:35,370
So you say the American spirit is,

4275
01:54:35,371 --> 01:54:37,350
tastes like shit in the
alarm rose taste better.

4276
01:54:37,351 --> 01:54:39,390
American spirits lasts forever.

4277
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:39,561
Yeah.

4278
01:54:39,561 --> 01:54:39,721
I mean,

4279
01:54:39,721 --> 01:54:40,770
you can have one cigarette,

4280
01:54:40,771 --> 01:54:43,080
it takes like 15 minutes
and sure have like two.

4281
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:43,831
Uh,

4282
01:54:43,831 --> 01:54:44,131
it,

4283
01:54:44,131 --> 01:54:44,391
it,

4284
01:54:44,391 --> 01:54:44,760
it's,

4285
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:45,720
it's a harsher thing.

4286
01:54:45,721 --> 01:54:46,650
You wake up the next day,

4287
01:54:46,651 --> 01:54:46,860
you're like,

4288
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:47,280
oh,

4289
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:48,990
like spitting up goobers and like,

4290
01:54:48,991 --> 01:54:51,990
it's really bad for you feeling,

4291
01:54:52,070 --> 01:54:52,430
uh,

4292
01:54:52,430 --> 01:54:53,970
bodywise where Marlboro.

4293
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,200
Like you could smoke a whole pack.

4294
01:54:56,470 --> 01:54:56,651
I mean,

4295
01:54:56,651 --> 01:54:57,484
I've known,

4296
01:54:57,580 --> 01:55:01,330
I mean one that should usually smells
good around it does smell good too.

4297
01:55:01,331 --> 01:55:02,770
They don't seem to be.

4298
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:03,551
Yeah.

4299
01:55:03,551 --> 01:55:07,510
Well Bertrand Russell didn't live to be
like fucking 90 something and he smoked

4300
01:55:07,511 --> 01:55:10,930
cigarettes every day or
smoked a high every day

4301
01:55:11,190 --> 01:55:13,770
you'll find people anywhere,

4302
01:55:13,771 --> 01:55:14,460
uh,

4303
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:19,460
willing to for the right amount of
money to just fucking railroad humanity.

4304
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:20,950
Hey,

4305
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:21,121
just,

4306
01:55:21,121 --> 01:55:21,451
we'll do it.

4307
01:55:21,451 --> 01:55:21,631
I mean,

4308
01:55:21,631 --> 01:55:22,890
what about all these climate change?

4309
01:55:22,950 --> 01:55:24,750
Fucking asshole climate change deniers.

4310
01:55:24,950 --> 01:55:25,530
Yeah,

4311
01:55:25,530 --> 01:55:27,510
so find out where they're getting paid.

4312
01:55:27,511 --> 01:55:32,190
This is so funny is there's actually you
can go online and find all the senators

4313
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:35,700
and all the congressmen that
are all climate change deniers.

4314
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:36,901
You can find them all.

4315
01:55:36,901 --> 01:55:36,991
They,

4316
01:55:36,991 --> 01:55:38,100
they've listed all their names.

4317
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:39,490
Well it's not just that.

4318
01:55:39,491 --> 01:55:40,051
How about the,

4319
01:55:40,051 --> 01:55:43,060
the different doctors that are testifying
against marijuana and you find out

4320
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:44,340
being paid by pharmaceutical

4321
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,150
companies.

4322
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:46,320
This time and time again,

4323
01:55:46,321 --> 01:55:49,950
experts had been co opted by money but
when you see it so clear that like this

4324
01:55:49,951 --> 01:55:50,521
fucking guy,

4325
01:55:50,521 --> 01:55:52,710
you could drink a whole quarter
of it and you'd be fine.

4326
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:53,131
Okay.

4327
01:55:53,131 --> 01:55:54,240
You want to drink it when you do,

4328
01:55:54,241 --> 01:55:55,260
you're a complete jerk.

4329
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:59,610
I wouldn't drink a whole
court of fucking orange.

4330
01:56:00,170 --> 01:56:01,003
Yeah,

4331
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:02,400
and they say that's safe.

4332
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:02,930
Right.

4333
01:56:02,930 --> 01:56:03,763
Which I,

4334
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:05,760
I don't know but I'm not going
to drink a quarter of it.

4335
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:07,193
Fuck that.

4336
01:56:07,290 --> 01:56:08,010
If he did,

4337
01:56:08,010 --> 01:56:09,210
you would want to throw up.

4338
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:10,260
I'm sure you would.

4339
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:11,700
I mean court of,

4340
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:13,320
first of all it's a powder.

4341
01:56:13,321 --> 01:56:14,370
You can really drove it quicker.

4342
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:15,180
You,

4343
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:18,390
you could pour a quart you to
amend the metal amount of liquid,

4344
01:56:18,391 --> 01:56:22,920
you would have to have to drink a quart
of Splenda or how about just a court of

4345
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:28,250
a quart of water with a appropriately
dissolved solid of Splenda within it?

4346
01:56:30,090 --> 01:56:31,380
I'll do it w

4347
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:34,453
it would only help him.

4348
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:34,730
Yeah,

4349
01:56:34,730 --> 01:56:35,300
I know.

4350
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:35,790
I know.

4351
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:36,490
This is what it all,

4352
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:37,201
because look,

4353
01:56:37,201 --> 01:56:41,160
if you've survived all the horrible
encounters you've had in your life up to

4354
01:56:41,161 --> 01:56:41,611
this point,

4355
01:56:41,611 --> 01:56:42,000
Brian,

4356
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,950
that what's that going to do?

4357
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:44,610
Right?

4358
01:56:44,610 --> 01:56:45,031
I mean,

4359
01:56:45,031 --> 01:56:46,200
you'd probably get a helpless,

4360
01:56:46,201 --> 01:56:46,441
right.

4361
01:56:46,441 --> 01:56:47,390
Dead in the eyes and kill,

4362
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:48,263
kill the aids.

4363
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:48,990
Fuck off.

4364
01:56:48,990 --> 01:56:49,823
You know?

4365
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:50,341
Yeah.

4366
01:56:50,341 --> 01:56:51,960
It's going to kill the
aids inside of her body.

4367
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:53,520
She's fucking,

4368
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:54,660
I can't deal with this.

4369
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:55,620
This is one,

4370
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:56,880
one level too far.

4371
01:56:57,090 --> 01:56:57,511
Yeah.

4372
01:56:57,511 --> 01:57:02,100
I wonder if there's gonna come a time
in our future where these kind of guys,

4373
01:57:02,120 --> 01:57:02,350
these,

4374
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:05,970
these guys were obviously bought
and paid just don't exist anymore.

4375
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:06,990
How do you do that though?

4376
01:57:06,991 --> 01:57:09,840
You have to make people accountable
and we don't want to seem to do that.

4377
01:57:09,841 --> 01:57:13,440
And then the people you would
expect would make them accountable.

4378
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:13,680
Right?

4379
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:14,090
These are the,

4380
01:57:14,090 --> 01:57:16,770
these checks and balances
that get put together too.

4381
01:57:16,771 --> 01:57:16,951
Well,

4382
01:57:16,951 --> 01:57:18,540
this is to police that and this is,

4383
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:19,890
they are all fucked up,

4384
01:57:19,891 --> 01:57:20,220
right?

4385
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:21,053
I mean,

4386
01:57:21,630 --> 01:57:24,990
how do you let the banks
just rob you blind?

4387
01:57:24,991 --> 01:57:25,201
You know,

4388
01:57:25,201 --> 01:57:28,740
there's that whole library scandal where
they're just fudge and fixing numbers

4389
01:57:28,741 --> 01:57:29,240
and,

4390
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:30,480
and they go to chase and they go,

4391
01:57:30,481 --> 01:57:30,691
well,

4392
01:57:30,691 --> 01:57:31,524
we're gonna,

4393
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:33,150
we're gonna find you.

4394
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:38,520
12 billion chased makes 45 billion a year.

4395
01:57:38,521 --> 01:57:39,750
It doesn't fucking matter.

4396
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:43,830
You know what they did in Vietnam was
they went and they grabbed all the people

4397
01:57:43,831 --> 01:57:45,690
that all the bankers and all that,

4398
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:50,760
all the officials that fucked everybody
over with in terms of the banking system

4399
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:53,400
and they stuck him life
in prison and killed them.

4400
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:56,310
Now you have one extreme to the other.

4401
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:58,800
But nonetheless,

4402
01:57:59,130 --> 01:57:59,963
I mean,

4403
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:01,133
what does,

4404
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:01,973
what does worse?

4405
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:02,341
Well,

4406
01:58:02,341 --> 01:58:02,600
yeah,

4407
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:02,911
they're mean.

4408
01:58:02,911 --> 01:58:06,720
There's been many bankers that have
been caught that are doing things like

4409
01:58:06,721 --> 01:58:09,420
they're laundering money for drug cartels.

4410
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:10,910
And that was one of the big ones.

4411
01:58:10,911 --> 01:58:15,540
It was recently exposed that these guys
were laundering money for Mexican drug

4412
01:58:15,541 --> 01:58:17,700
cartels and they just got a big fat fine.

4413
01:58:18,330 --> 01:58:18,660
You know,

4414
01:58:18,660 --> 01:58:19,340
I mean we,

4415
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:19,770
meanwhile,

4416
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:20,580
if it was you,

4417
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:23,570
like if Brian was busted
laundering money for drug,

4418
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,500
you'd be in jail for the
rest of your fucking life.

4419
01:58:25,501 --> 01:58:26,334
100%.

4420
01:58:26,370 --> 01:58:29,100
They take all of his fucking dryers and,

4421
01:58:29,110 --> 01:58:29,820
and uh,

4422
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:31,290
all this all is whirlpools.

4423
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:32,251
They'd get it.

4424
01:58:32,251 --> 01:58:32,641
Cause you know,

4425
01:58:32,641 --> 01:58:33,474
he laundering,

4426
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:34,990
he would really launder it.

4427
01:58:35,270 --> 01:58:36,103
I know.

4428
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:38,070
It's like I can do that.

4429
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:41,390
He'd have an iron and ironing
board and turn it to super,

4430
01:58:41,530 --> 01:58:41,980
I could get

4431
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,210
more money out of super.

4432
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:46,980
Are you trying to say that
Brian is a child who's hockey?

4433
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:49,180
I'm not exactly sure what
you're trying to say,

4434
01:58:49,181 --> 01:58:49,420
man.

4435
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:51,910
I just like fucking with him
because he's here and he never,

4436
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,560
every time I've been on your podcast,

4437
01:58:53,561 --> 01:58:55,930
Brian's off in the corner doing,

4438
01:58:55,931 --> 01:58:56,531
I don't even know.

4439
01:58:56,531 --> 01:58:58,090
I don't want to know
why right next to you.

4440
01:58:58,091 --> 01:58:59,210
So you can't hide anymore.

4441
01:58:59,280 --> 01:58:59,490
And,

4442
01:58:59,490 --> 01:59:00,160
and uh,

4443
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:05,160
last time I saw him it was at our Buddy
Ryan's a or was it at the laugh factory

4444
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:07,400
comedy stores?

4445
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:08,201
Where was at the comedy store.

4446
01:59:08,201 --> 01:59:08,450
But yeah.

4447
01:59:08,450 --> 01:59:11,020
So I'm always like,

4448
01:59:11,021 --> 01:59:12,190
why don't you ever fucking,

4449
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:13,660
you know me.

4450
01:59:13,930 --> 01:59:15,070
Why don't you hang out?

4451
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:15,371
Yeah.

4452
01:59:15,371 --> 01:59:15,911
Why don't you come in,

4453
01:59:15,911 --> 01:59:16,301
hang out,

4454
01:59:16,301 --> 01:59:16,900
say something.

4455
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:18,790
Cause he's nervous around
you because you're a man.

4456
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:19,953
I am a man.

4457
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:23,030
I made the kind of pheromones
it make other men will.

4458
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:23,480
They were kind of,

4459
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:23,770
man,

4460
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:27,070
I need you to help me with my ground
game and my ground game is hopscotch.

4461
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:28,480
So Oh easily.

4462
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:30,320
We'll go from that to uh,

4463
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:32,080
the fucking rubber band.

4464
01:59:32,110 --> 01:59:33,520
Jump Rope and uh,

4465
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:35,230
we'll do foursquare after that.

4466
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:36,083
Right?

4467
01:59:36,130 --> 01:59:37,240
I got all the kids games down.

4468
01:59:37,450 --> 01:59:38,020
Do you?

4469
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:38,853
Oh yeah.

4470
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:39,310
How do you,

4471
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:41,210
how am I supposed to meet anybody in this,

4472
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:42,830
this terrible world?

4473
01:59:42,831 --> 01:59:43,041
I mean,

4474
01:59:43,041 --> 01:59:44,030
come online dating.

4475
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,720
You don't mind game.

4476
01:59:47,090 --> 01:59:50,590
I go out to the foursquare courts gaming
to find better words when you find the

4477
01:59:50,591 --> 01:59:51,424
athletes.

4478
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:54,350
This fucking was done.

4479
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:57,050
Do you want to do $5?

4480
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:57,560
Just listen.

4481
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:58,980
I've just listened to a lot of,

4482
01:59:58,981 --> 01:59:59,530
uh,

4483
01:59:59,530 --> 02:00:01,630
just listen to a lot of
Jethro Tull Aqualung,

4484
02:00:01,631 --> 02:00:01,991
you know,

4485
02:00:01,991 --> 02:00:03,580
or you want to do five minutes.

4486
02:00:04,010 --> 02:00:05,470
Do you ever want to do standup comedy?

4487
02:00:05,471 --> 02:00:05,600
Right.

4488
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:06,230
Do,

4489
02:00:06,230 --> 02:00:07,700
and here's why.

4490
02:00:08,540 --> 02:00:09,980
It terrifies me,

4491
02:00:09,981 --> 02:00:11,210
Joe and Brian,

4492
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:16,240
that terrifies me that you're
so raw and exposed up there.

4493
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:20,240
And I'm not,

4494
02:00:20,241 --> 02:00:21,290
when I go and I fight,

4495
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:22,850
I can fight for myself.

4496
02:00:22,851 --> 02:00:23,750
I can do it all.

4497
02:00:23,990 --> 02:00:24,823
You know,

4498
02:00:24,830 --> 02:00:25,663
my,

4499
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:29,180
my success is measured upon my end.

4500
02:00:29,410 --> 02:00:29,750
You know,

4501
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:31,550
did I get my hand raised in
and not getting my hand raised?

4502
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:33,680
When you go out on that stage,

4503
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:35,420
people are okay,

4504
02:00:36,170 --> 02:00:37,520
make me laugh fucker.

4505
02:00:37,730 --> 02:00:37,941
Right.

4506
02:00:37,941 --> 02:00:38,631
You're supposed to be funny,

4507
02:00:38,631 --> 02:00:39,110
aren't you?

4508
02:00:39,110 --> 02:00:40,760
So alright,

4509
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:41,720
here I am.

4510
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:42,950
Or they're like this.

4511
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:43,971
I don't give a shit.

4512
02:00:43,971 --> 02:00:45,350
I'm talking to Brian or having a drink,

4513
02:00:45,351 --> 02:00:45,801
whatever,

4514
02:00:45,801 --> 02:00:47,420
some fucking noise off to my left.

4515
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:50,240
I got to be interesting.

4516
02:00:50,241 --> 02:00:53,450
I got to do something that's
going to draw their attention.

4517
02:00:53,451 --> 02:00:54,410
And once I've drawn it,

4518
02:00:54,620 --> 02:00:55,453
I need to keep it.

4519
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:56,121
Okay,

4520
02:00:56,121 --> 02:00:56,954
you got me.

4521
02:00:57,530 --> 02:00:58,363
What,

4522
02:00:59,150 --> 02:01:00,170
why should I pay attention?

4523
02:01:00,171 --> 02:01:00,621
And so I,

4524
02:01:00,621 --> 02:01:03,080
there's this necessity to,

4525
02:01:03,140 --> 02:01:03,490
to,

4526
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:05,270
to be able to get a response for them,

4527
02:01:05,271 --> 02:01:07,940
which I understand from
professional wrestling because
I've been out in the ring

4528
02:01:07,941 --> 02:01:08,480
and I,

4529
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:11,240
I listen to the crowd and I see
what works and what doesn't work.

4530
02:01:11,241 --> 02:01:12,920
And so I have an understanding.

4531
02:01:12,950 --> 02:01:13,783
I feel,

4532
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:14,181
uh,

4533
02:01:14,181 --> 02:01:16,280
and from being around yourself and other,

4534
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:16,491
you know,

4535
02:01:16,491 --> 02:01:17,324
I've,

4536
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:18,770
I've not like a talk about it a lot,

4537
02:01:18,771 --> 02:01:20,470
but I've hung out with
quite a few comedians,

4538
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:21,141
you know,

4539
02:01:21,141 --> 02:01:24,320
been there backstage for their shows
and we're fucking around warming up and

4540
02:01:24,321 --> 02:01:25,220
doing all this stuff and it's,

4541
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:26,360
but I look at it and I go,

4542
02:01:26,361 --> 02:01:29,630
this is not just cracking
jokes and making people laugh,

4543
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:32,690
and it is okay to bomb
because you're going to,

4544
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:33,800
you're always going to fail.

4545
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:39,160
But it's just such a raw
personal to a degree,

4546
02:01:40,491 --> 02:01:42,320
to me it's just for ripening.

4547
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:43,730
Utterly frightening.

4548
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:44,061
Yeah.

4549
02:01:44,061 --> 02:01:45,050
You should definitely do it then.

4550
02:01:45,110 --> 02:01:45,620
Do it tonight.

4551
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:46,580
It's not that hard.

4552
02:01:47,090 --> 02:01:47,361
No,

4553
02:01:47,361 --> 02:01:47,780
don't do,

4554
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:48,613
don't listen to him.

4555
02:01:49,010 --> 02:01:49,850
If you're going to do it,

4556
02:01:49,851 --> 02:01:50,780
you should plan it out.

4557
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:53,690
I should definitely think about
it and write some stuff down.

4558
02:01:53,691 --> 02:01:54,120
I listen

4559
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:54,350
to,

4560
02:01:54,350 --> 02:01:59,090
to things that you've said before about
being a comedian from documentary stuff

4561
02:01:59,091 --> 02:02:00,260
and things that I've seen of you.

4562
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:03,470
And I have a thing in here,

4563
02:02:03,471 --> 02:02:05,630
in my notebook all on my phone.

4564
02:02:06,290 --> 02:02:07,400
Nothing but bits.

4565
02:02:07,990 --> 02:02:08,823
So you've thought about,

4566
02:02:08,860 --> 02:02:09,281
oh yeah,

4567
02:02:09,281 --> 02:02:09,421
no,

4568
02:02:09,421 --> 02:02:09,550
no,

4569
02:02:09,550 --> 02:02:09,900
no.

4570
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:10,900
I think about it.

4571
02:02:10,901 --> 02:02:11,561
I want you to do it.

4572
02:02:11,561 --> 02:02:12,490
Go to an open mic night.

4573
02:02:12,491 --> 02:02:13,660
Don't do it at a regular show.

4574
02:02:13,661 --> 02:02:15,190
He's trying to get you
to do one of his shows.

4575
02:02:15,191 --> 02:02:16,024
Don't

4576
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:18,263
do it.

4577
02:02:18,730 --> 02:02:18,911
No,

4578
02:02:18,911 --> 02:02:21,010
you should go to a regular open mic night.

4579
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:22,870
Like whether at the comedy store,

4580
02:02:22,930 --> 02:02:24,550
wherever you know,

4581
02:02:24,551 --> 02:02:26,090
just to five minutes or whatever they get.

4582
02:02:26,091 --> 02:02:26,501
What did they give you?

4583
02:02:26,501 --> 02:02:27,160
Three minutes,

4584
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:27,731
two minutes.

4585
02:02:27,731 --> 02:02:30,070
Or you can do them in one minute and
killed Tony and we can help you out.

4586
02:02:30,130 --> 02:02:30,810
Don't do it now.

4587
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:31,780
I don't know about that.

4588
02:02:31,781 --> 02:02:32,614
And you know,

4589
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:33,750
they'll put it on the internet.

4590
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:34,773
Sometimes.

4591
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:35,771
I'll be honest,

4592
02:02:35,771 --> 02:02:36,604
Joe,

4593
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:42,240
the shit that wants that I want to say
probably not good for the rest of what

4594
02:02:43,601 --> 02:02:44,650
I'm trying to accomplish.

4595
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:46,010
Nah,

4596
02:02:46,010 --> 02:02:46,670
I disagree.

4597
02:02:46,670 --> 02:02:47,320
I don't know.

4598
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:48,180
In what way?

4599
02:02:48,181 --> 02:02:49,014
How would it hurt you?

4600
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:49,620
I,

4601
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:51,710
I just really dark,

4602
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:52,521
weird,

4603
02:02:52,521 --> 02:02:54,260
fucked up shit comes out of my mouth.

4604
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:55,310
Look like,

4605
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:56,390
would you give me an example?

4606
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:57,480
Nope.

4607
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:58,100
No.

4608
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:58,933
Okay.

4609
02:03:00,590 --> 02:03:01,423
Ah,

4610
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:05,230
so I did this thing before
MMA roasted was anything,

4611
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:05,770
right?

4612
02:03:05,770 --> 02:03:06,640
They wanted to do.

4613
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,230
They want to shoot a sizzle,

4614
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:09,610
send it off to spike.

4615
02:03:09,611 --> 02:03:10,840
They wanted to make a show,

4616
02:03:11,290 --> 02:03:12,280
an actual show,

4617
02:03:12,281 --> 02:03:13,810
you do a panel and all this stuff.

4618
02:03:14,590 --> 02:03:15,520
So,

4619
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:16,533
um,

4620
02:03:17,860 --> 02:03:18,693
uh,

4621
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:20,590
Adam and uh,

4622
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:21,941
oh my God,

4623
02:03:21,941 --> 02:03:23,620
why am I forgetting
everybody's name right now?

4624
02:03:24,390 --> 02:03:24,941
God dammit.

4625
02:03:24,941 --> 02:03:25,361
T rex.

4626
02:03:25,361 --> 02:03:26,380
So t rex hits me up and goes,

4627
02:03:26,381 --> 02:03:26,861
come on out,

4628
02:03:26,861 --> 02:03:27,700
come out and do this thing.

4629
02:03:28,220 --> 02:03:29,053
All right.

4630
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:29,381
Uh,

4631
02:03:29,381 --> 02:03:30,190
what is it?

4632
02:03:30,190 --> 02:03:30,820
Okay,

4633
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:33,460
I'll come sit around and you guys are
gonna probably try and talk shit to me and

4634
02:03:33,461 --> 02:03:35,860
talking about my past and fuck with
me and say steroids and whatever,

4635
02:03:35,861 --> 02:03:36,970
but I don't give a fuck.

4636
02:03:37,330 --> 02:03:40,660
So I come out and they
have this green rooms,

4637
02:03:40,690 --> 02:03:44,590
this green screen thing set up in this
deal and Adam does a monologue spots and

4638
02:03:44,591 --> 02:03:45,424
then he does,

4639
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:49,540
he gets to the panel where we talk about
whatever's going on in MMA and we can,

4640
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:53,350
we can fucking step off in any
direction we want and have fun.

4641
02:03:53,770 --> 02:03:57,800
And then he'll do a one on one where he,

4642
02:03:57,801 --> 02:03:58,271
in the,

4643
02:03:58,271 --> 02:03:59,770
whoever the guest is of the week,

4644
02:03:59,771 --> 02:04:00,041
we'll,

4645
02:04:00,041 --> 02:04:03,070
we'll sit there and Adam's just basically
kind of fuck with you the whole time.

4646
02:04:03,130 --> 02:04:05,440
So I come in,

4647
02:04:05,830 --> 02:04:08,530
I sit down on this panel thing
and they're filming all of this.

4648
02:04:08,650 --> 02:04:13,650
So it's t rex is to my left me this
female comedian who I don't really know an

4649
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:14,650
Adam.

4650
02:04:14,650 --> 02:04:17,530
And then we just sit there and we start
talking and I just start saying shit.

4651
02:04:17,531 --> 02:04:17,861
One,

4652
02:04:17,861 --> 02:04:20,850
the female comedian immediately
gets really upset when we

4653
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:23,200
t-rex,

4654
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:24,011
can't stop laughing,

4655
02:04:24,011 --> 02:04:24,790
neither can add them.

4656
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:28,480
And then I keep picking on fucking t rex
the whole time about his clothing line

4657
02:04:28,860 --> 02:04:29,591
at every,

4658
02:04:29,591 --> 02:04:31,240
at every point available.

4659
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:33,160
Then we go and we do the,

4660
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:34,160
the,

4661
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:37,120
the sit down with me and Adam
and then I take it from him.

4662
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:40,980
And then I was just start making them
laugh and saying really weird shit and

4663
02:04:41,130 --> 02:04:42,540
completely throwing them for a loop.

4664
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:44,280
And I just said to him,

4665
02:04:44,281 --> 02:04:44,881
at the end of the day,

4666
02:04:44,881 --> 02:04:45,091
I go,

4667
02:04:45,091 --> 02:04:46,020
that was a lot of fun.

4668
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:47,550
This is never seen the light of day,

4669
02:04:47,551 --> 02:04:48,384
right?

4670
02:04:48,630 --> 02:04:49,331
No,

4671
02:04:49,331 --> 02:04:50,160
not always.

4672
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:50,840
Good.

4673
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:51,050
Well,

4674
02:04:51,050 --> 02:04:52,020
what were you saying?

4675
02:04:52,050 --> 02:04:52,883
Nah,

4676
02:04:53,740 --> 02:04:54,810
I don't want to talk about,

4677
02:04:54,811 --> 02:04:55,230
no,

4678
02:04:55,230 --> 02:04:56,063
it was funny.

4679
02:04:56,190 --> 02:04:56,760
I think,

4680
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:57,061
well,

4681
02:04:57,061 --> 02:04:58,110
they thought it was funny at the time.

4682
02:04:58,111 --> 02:04:58,801
I thought it was funny,

4683
02:04:58,801 --> 02:04:59,130
but,

4684
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:00,850
but I've said a lot of fucked up things.

4685
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:02,970
You can say those things
because they're your,

4686
02:05:02,971 --> 02:05:04,080
there's an excepted

4687
02:05:04,220 --> 02:05:06,020
aspect that you are Joe Rogan,

4688
02:05:06,021 --> 02:05:06,561
the comedian.

4689
02:05:06,561 --> 02:05:08,330
You are Joe Rogan talks about DMT,

4690
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:12,980
talks about marijuana and aliens and
all kinds of stuff and we accept that.

4691
02:05:12,981 --> 02:05:13,490
And you're,

4692
02:05:13,490 --> 02:05:13,850
you're,

4693
02:05:13,850 --> 02:05:16,830
you're an established person within the,

4694
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:18,230
the fan base that you have.

4695
02:05:18,231 --> 02:05:22,730
And you're a known commodity for those
that are only casual Joe Rogan knowers

4696
02:05:22,731 --> 02:05:23,530
from,

4697
02:05:23,530 --> 02:05:24,363
uh,

4698
02:05:24,730 --> 02:05:24,970
uh,

4699
02:05:24,970 --> 02:05:25,803
news radio.

4700
02:05:25,810 --> 02:05:25,990
No,

4701
02:05:25,990 --> 02:05:26,121
no,

4702
02:05:26,121 --> 02:05:26,510
I'm sorry.

4703
02:05:26,510 --> 02:05:27,130
Uh,

4704
02:05:27,130 --> 02:05:27,530
uh,

4705
02:05:27,530 --> 02:05:28,041
the fucking,

4706
02:05:28,041 --> 02:05:28,874
the factor.

4707
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:29,661
Well that,

4708
02:05:29,661 --> 02:05:30,500
but even before that,

4709
02:05:30,950 --> 02:05:31,400
uh,

4710
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:31,631
the,

4711
02:05:31,631 --> 02:05:32,240
the radio,

4712
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:33,950
the Sitcom you did news radio,

4713
02:05:33,951 --> 02:05:34,161
news,

4714
02:05:34,161 --> 02:05:34,510
radio,

4715
02:05:34,510 --> 02:05:34,970
yeah,

4716
02:05:34,970 --> 02:05:35,900
fear factor.

4717
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:38,210
All of these other
things where people will,

4718
02:05:38,270 --> 02:05:38,631
we'll see,

4719
02:05:38,631 --> 02:05:39,110
hey,

4720
02:05:39,110 --> 02:05:39,801
Joe Rogan,

4721
02:05:39,801 --> 02:05:40,491
he's a comedian.

4722
02:05:40,491 --> 02:05:41,590
Maybe we've seen some of his standup,

4723
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:42,260
maybe not,

4724
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:44,060
but we know him as a
personality on television,

4725
02:05:44,190 --> 02:05:45,011
so you know,

4726
02:05:45,011 --> 02:05:46,110
I'm fucking around.

4727
02:05:46,111 --> 02:05:46,861
Whereas with you,

4728
02:05:46,861 --> 02:05:49,980
they might just think you're a snob and
I'm an athlete and I'm supposed to be

4729
02:05:49,981 --> 02:05:51,270
this and I'm supposed to be bad.

4730
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:55,830
And so if I make off color jokes that are,

4731
02:05:56,430 --> 02:05:56,820
it's like,

4732
02:05:56,820 --> 02:05:57,180
oh,

4733
02:05:57,180 --> 02:05:58,080
that's too far,

4734
02:05:58,110 --> 02:05:58,560
but whatever.

4735
02:05:58,560 --> 02:05:59,760
When you retired from fighting,

4736
02:05:59,790 --> 02:06:00,623
how many more years?

4737
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:01,260
How old are you now?

4738
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:03,060
36 37 37.

4739
02:06:03,090 --> 02:06:04,710
How many more years do you
think you'll be competing?

4740
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:05,101
Uh,

4741
02:06:05,101 --> 02:06:05,821
till I'm done now.

4742
02:06:05,821 --> 02:06:07,200
See that's going on til I'm done.

4743
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:08,153
Because

4744
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:10,640
like I said before about
that athletic window.

4745
02:06:10,641 --> 02:06:14,270
So Joe Rogan has a,

4746
02:06:14,271 --> 02:06:14,541
you know,

4747
02:06:14,541 --> 02:06:16,250
this whole part of his
whole career to stand up,

4748
02:06:16,430 --> 02:06:18,920
very standup oriented and specific.

4749
02:06:19,220 --> 02:06:20,060
And then boom,

4750
02:06:20,061 --> 02:06:21,530
he moves into a movies and then he,

4751
02:06:21,531 --> 02:06:22,970
maybe he goes from there into politics.

4752
02:06:22,971 --> 02:06:23,390
I mean,

4753
02:06:23,390 --> 02:06:26,420
the thing is that you can enter
any kind of line you want,

4754
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:30,170
but those things are not
incumbent on your physicality.

4755
02:06:30,890 --> 02:06:32,360
What they are is it's your mind.

4756
02:06:32,361 --> 02:06:34,910
It's your ability to fighting physicality.

4757
02:06:34,911 --> 02:06:36,230
Anything athletic wise,

4758
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:37,910
you have so long to do it.

4759
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:39,673
And that's it.

4760
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:42,140
When that opportunity has passed,

4761
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:43,760
you cannot do it anymore.

4762
02:06:43,761 --> 02:06:45,090
Now maybe you know,

4763
02:06:45,091 --> 02:06:46,250
you could say,

4764
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:46,701
okay,

4765
02:06:46,701 --> 02:06:51,701
well Joe went for the US national
team for taekwondo to go to,

4766
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:54,770
to win that and then go where in the
world team trials and go to the Olympics.

4767
02:06:55,070 --> 02:06:56,120
Going to the Olympics is a,

4768
02:06:56,121 --> 02:06:58,670
is a short opportunity in life.

4769
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,210
Once you get past that point where
you can be competitive at that,

4770
02:07:02,390 --> 02:07:04,160
that doesn't mean you
can't do taekwondo anymore.

4771
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:05,930
It wouldn't mean that you
couldn't do other tournaments,

4772
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:09,110
but trying to be the Olympic
champion and taekwondo,

4773
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:09,441
I was like,

4774
02:07:09,441 --> 02:07:10,274
wow,

4775
02:07:10,930 --> 02:07:11,870
that was gone.

4776
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:13,430
That opportunity has passed me.

4777
02:07:13,910 --> 02:07:14,540
For me,

4778
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:15,560
we're now opportunity to,

4779
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:19,070
for me to be a successful
high level fighter is gone.

4780
02:07:19,071 --> 02:07:19,904
It's gone.

4781
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:20,991
It's just,

4782
02:07:20,991 --> 02:07:21,824
that's it.

4783
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:26,090
You just have to personally assess
when you feel like your body is not

4784
02:07:26,091 --> 02:07:27,540
performing the way you expect it to.

4785
02:07:27,541 --> 02:07:28,020
Exactly.

4786
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:28,960
But right now you're cool with it

4787
02:07:29,020 --> 02:07:29,381
right now.

4788
02:07:29,381 --> 02:07:30,191
I'm cool right now.

4789
02:07:30,191 --> 02:07:32,860
I know I can do a lot better than

4790
02:07:33,130 --> 02:07:34,210
last fight for sure.

4791
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:36,040
Why did you decide take so much time off

4792
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,360
between your last fight and now?

4793
02:07:37,450 --> 02:07:39,580
I wasn't into my last fight and be honest,

4794
02:07:39,581 --> 02:07:40,414
I didn't care.

4795
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:41,280
I just,

4796
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:42,370
I wasn't up for it.

4797
02:07:42,730 --> 02:07:45,610
I trained and I got to a
point where I'm just like,

4798
02:07:45,611 --> 02:07:46,444
I'm over this.

4799
02:07:46,690 --> 02:07:47,523
You're over it.

4800
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:48,373
Who are in town?

4801
02:07:48,430 --> 02:07:49,181
Who is this guy?

4802
02:07:49,181 --> 02:07:50,410
I mean Travis Brown.

4803
02:07:50,411 --> 02:07:50,661
Really?

4804
02:07:50,661 --> 02:07:50,891
Yeah,

4805
02:07:50,891 --> 02:07:51,724
but it's just like,

4806
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:52,091
okay,

4807
02:07:52,091 --> 02:07:52,781
if I beat him,

4808
02:07:52,781 --> 02:07:53,614
what does that do?

4809
02:07:53,770 --> 02:07:53,921
Well,

4810
02:07:53,921 --> 02:07:55,150
he's a top five fighter,

4811
02:07:55,210 --> 02:07:55,810
so what?

4812
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:58,600
Then I get to not fight another guy and
fight another guy and fight another guy

4813
02:07:58,601 --> 02:07:59,171
until it's like,

4814
02:07:59,171 --> 02:07:59,321
well,

4815
02:07:59,321 --> 02:07:59,611
where,

4816
02:07:59,611 --> 02:08:00,700
where am I going with this?

4817
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:03,220
I'm in the grind and I'm trying to,

4818
02:08:03,550 --> 02:08:06,850
I'm not going to climb this fucking ladder
to prove that I deserve to fight for

4819
02:08:06,851 --> 02:08:07,684
a title.

4820
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:08,860
I can fight for a title,

4821
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:10,510
I guess anyone in any league,

4822
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:11,290
anywhere,

4823
02:08:11,290 --> 02:08:12,123
anytime.

4824
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:15,670
Fucking I'm a championship
world champion level guy.

4825
02:08:15,970 --> 02:08:18,160
I don't need to prove that I belong here.

4826
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:20,830
I've fought Travis Browne's all my career.

4827
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:23,620
They just had a different name
at a different point in life.

4828
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:25,000
They had the same type of skillset.

4829
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:26,170
They're basically the same guy.

4830
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:30,490
There'll be another Travis Browne when
Travis Browne is done being Travis

4831
02:08:30,490 --> 02:08:31,323
Browne.

4832
02:08:31,510 --> 02:08:33,490
So what do you try to say that you,

4833
02:08:33,670 --> 02:08:36,430
the only thing that would get
you up is a fight for a title.

4834
02:08:36,610 --> 02:08:37,540
Not necessarily,

4835
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:39,550
but just I got to fight
when it makes sense to me.

4836
02:08:39,551 --> 02:08:41,680
I got to fight when
I'm motivated to do so.

4837
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:42,550
I don't,

4838
02:08:42,550 --> 02:08:45,610
I'm not looking to try and say,

4839
02:08:46,030 --> 02:08:46,451
all right,

4840
02:08:46,451 --> 02:08:50,200
throw me in there with all these other
fucking goof balls and let us just beat

4841
02:08:50,201 --> 02:08:53,050
each other's heads in until we
try to prove that we belong here.

4842
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:54,010
Does that just signify,

4843
02:08:54,011 --> 02:08:56,830
look at the final chapter of
your athletic career then?

4844
02:08:56,831 --> 02:08:59,230
Because if like a guy like Travis Browne,

4845
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:00,310
if you were coming up,

4846
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:02,750
you would relish the opportunity
to fight a top five guy.

4847
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:03,520
Sure.

4848
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:05,800
So is it because you
just very established?

4849
02:09:05,801 --> 02:09:06,940
He'd been around a long time?

4850
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:09,180
I've learned that I don't need to,

4851
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:11,620
I don't need to prove myself in that way.

4852
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:12,670
When I,

4853
02:09:12,670 --> 02:09:13,361
when I go to,

4854
02:09:13,361 --> 02:09:13,680
I don't,

4855
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:13,860
I,

4856
02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:16,000
I've been a top 10
fighter for over a decade.

4857
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:18,700
I've been top five for over
a decade most of the time.

4858
02:09:18,701 --> 02:09:22,180
So whether or not someone
ranks me wherever they rank me,

4859
02:09:22,181 --> 02:09:23,110
it doesn't really matter.

4860
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:25,330
I can step in there and do the job.

4861
02:09:25,630 --> 02:09:28,960
And this next fight might be against Roy,

4862
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:29,853
which is fine,

4863
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:33,100
but if then the next fight is we want
you to fight cane or Buddhism or whoever,

4864
02:09:33,101 --> 02:09:33,970
like let's go,

4865
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:35,380
I'm fucking ready to do it.

4866
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:37,300
But did you feel that
when you fought Frank Mir?

4867
02:09:37,660 --> 02:09:38,400
Yes.

4868
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:39,610
When I fought Frank Mir,

4869
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:43,420
I was fucking pumped because
for one I've been told,

4870
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:44,291
oh,

4871
02:09:44,291 --> 02:09:45,190
that I'd hear it.

4872
02:09:45,191 --> 02:09:48,070
All these people we think it's going
to be deal is because he's such a tough

4873
02:09:48,071 --> 02:09:48,490
fight.

4874
02:09:48,490 --> 02:09:48,860
And,

4875
02:09:48,860 --> 02:09:49,780
and Frank Mir is,

4876
02:09:49,781 --> 02:09:51,370
he's the piece of the best submission guy.

4877
02:09:51,371 --> 02:09:53,620
And or back when I was in the UFC,

4878
02:09:53,850 --> 02:09:54,683
uh,

4879
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:56,110
and frank was just coming up,

4880
02:09:56,111 --> 02:09:56,351
they're like,

4881
02:09:56,351 --> 02:09:56,441
oh,

4882
02:09:56,441 --> 02:09:57,550
this guy's the future.

4883
02:09:57,551 --> 02:09:58,390
He's the best.

4884
02:09:58,391 --> 02:09:59,500
He's going to be the greatest.

4885
02:09:59,501 --> 02:10:03,280
And always hearing all this stuff about
how Frank Mir is my equal or better.

4886
02:10:03,910 --> 02:10:04,743
And I'm just like,

4887
02:10:05,050 --> 02:10:06,550
this shit is over with.

4888
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:08,021
This is not,

4889
02:10:08,021 --> 02:10:10,210
I'm going to show you the
difference between us,

4890
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:11,830
between him and me.

4891
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:13,360
So you were excited about him.

4892
02:10:13,361 --> 02:10:14,530
That was a very important fight.

4893
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:14,980
Yes.

4894
02:10:14,980 --> 02:10:16,370
That was a Travis Brown wasn't it?

4895
02:10:16,371 --> 02:10:17,080
Didn't care.

4896
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:17,410
Wow.

4897
02:10:17,410 --> 02:10:18,420
That's Kinda crazy.

4898
02:10:18,660 --> 02:10:19,390
Yeah,

4899
02:10:19,390 --> 02:10:19,991
that's w well,

4900
02:10:19,991 --> 02:10:21,370
I guess that's a personal thing,

4901
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:21,611
right?

4902
02:10:21,611 --> 02:10:23,020
Your own personal motivation,

4903
02:10:23,021 --> 02:10:27,220
like the only person who could decide
what fights are up for and when fights or

4904
02:10:27,221 --> 02:10:28,030
not are you?

4905
02:10:28,030 --> 02:10:28,630
That's true.

4906
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:29,200
Would you be,

4907
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:30,430
would you be up for a rematch?

4908
02:10:30,431 --> 02:10:32,110
Like if they offered you
a rematch with Travis,

4909
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:33,040
here's the difference.

4910
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:34,280
If I fight Travis

4911
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:38,330
now I'm going to want to fucking take his
head off because he disrespected me in

4912
02:10:38,331 --> 02:10:39,440
the ring after the match.

4913
02:10:39,441 --> 02:10:41,770
He did all this fucking
shit and it's like,

4914
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:42,351
what did they do?

4915
02:10:42,351 --> 02:10:43,880
What did he fucking cut his throat?

4916
02:10:43,881 --> 02:10:44,661
He did all this stuff,

4917
02:10:44,661 --> 02:10:46,430
but don't you do that to
you do that all the time.

4918
02:10:46,431 --> 02:10:47,390
I have to do my thing.

4919
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:49,910
He did it to mock me and I'm just like,

4920
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:50,331
dude,

4921
02:10:50,331 --> 02:10:55,331
I've been nice to you and respectful to
you from day one and then you go ahead

4922
02:10:55,701 --> 02:10:56,840
and you go and you get a win on me.

4923
02:10:56,841 --> 02:10:57,674
Great.

4924
02:10:58,070 --> 02:11:01,400
This is your moment to say what you want
to say and what you want to do is to

4925
02:11:01,401 --> 02:11:03,980
try and fucking put me down after you win.

4926
02:11:04,730 --> 02:11:06,380
So you feel like by him doing this,

4927
02:11:06,381 --> 02:11:10,160
the thumb across the neck
thing and apparently he was
very dismissive of me and

4928
02:11:10,161 --> 02:11:11,480
interviews and all this shit and I'm like,

4929
02:11:11,481 --> 02:11:11,691
wow,

4930
02:11:11,691 --> 02:11:12,280
that's cool.

4931
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:12,900
What do you disagree?

4932
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:13,733
You're a post,

4933
02:11:13,850 --> 02:11:14,300
post,

4934
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:14,661
post,

4935
02:11:14,661 --> 02:11:15,081
post,

4936
02:11:15,081 --> 02:11:15,231
all.

4937
02:11:15,231 --> 02:11:16,064
Everything is post.

4938
02:11:16,070 --> 02:11:19,430
Everything was post and I didn't find
out about this shit until way after the

4939
02:11:19,431 --> 02:11:19,731
fact.

4940
02:11:19,731 --> 02:11:22,550
I actually saw him backstage and
come up and shook his hand and said,

4941
02:11:22,551 --> 02:11:22,851
all right,

4942
02:11:22,851 --> 02:11:23,091
you know,

4943
02:11:23,091 --> 02:11:23,271
hey,

4944
02:11:23,271 --> 02:11:24,104
this was your night.

4945
02:11:24,860 --> 02:11:25,610
Me,

4946
02:11:25,610 --> 02:11:27,440
I don't have any reason
to be a fucking prick,

4947
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:28,700
especially after I win.

4948
02:11:28,730 --> 02:11:30,800
But you know what a guy wins.

4949
02:11:30,830 --> 02:11:32,450
He feels like he's on top of the world.

4950
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:33,620
You know what?

4951
02:11:33,620 --> 02:11:35,330
That's when you're going
to say some shit like that.

4952
02:11:35,331 --> 02:11:37,370
That's when you're going
to act out and then,

4953
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:38,990
ah,

4954
02:11:38,990 --> 02:11:39,291
fuck.

4955
02:11:39,291 --> 02:11:39,711
I'm just like,

4956
02:11:39,711 --> 02:11:40,071
all right,

4957
02:11:40,071 --> 02:11:40,281
cool.

4958
02:11:40,281 --> 02:11:42,080
If that's the way it's
going to be awesome.

4959
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:43,250
If we rematch,

4960
02:11:43,250 --> 02:11:45,230
it's not going to be the same
dude you fought that night.

4961
02:11:45,231 --> 02:11:46,400
You have no idea.

4962
02:11:46,610 --> 02:11:47,660
You really don't get it.

4963
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:48,860
You were,

4964
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:52,210
you will get your ass handed
to you because now you made,

4965
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:55,190
you gave me a reason to want to kick
your ass and what would be the difference

4966
02:11:55,191 --> 02:11:57,260
between the way you would
perform in this fight?

4967
02:11:57,290 --> 02:11:57,980
The way he performed,

4968
02:11:57,980 --> 02:11:59,160
the first fight I look for,

4969
02:11:59,161 --> 02:11:59,750
for one,

4970
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:03,140
I would make him pay for all of the
big mistakes he makes all the time.

4971
02:12:03,710 --> 02:12:04,071
Like what?

4972
02:12:04,071 --> 02:12:04,700
Big mistakes.

4973
02:12:04,700 --> 02:12:07,400
He's constantly wiffen
throwing the biggest shots.

4974
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:12,430
That kid has no stamina because he will
always go for the kill and everything he

4975
02:12:12,591 --> 02:12:13,191
does now,

4976
02:12:13,191 --> 02:12:15,410
if that makes him very
dangerous to a heavyweight,

4977
02:12:15,411 --> 02:12:18,140
especially because he's athletic
and he's got some power,

4978
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:21,890
but that's why I've heard him took him
out because he's missing with all this

4979
02:12:21,891 --> 02:12:24,770
big shit and you're getting picked apart
and picked apart and picked apart and

4980
02:12:24,771 --> 02:12:27,950
hung on and hung on and
grabbed in separate and
picked apart and picked apart.

4981
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:29,600
I mean,

4982
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:31,490
why is Varun beating you on the feet?

4983
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:35,630
Because he broke his hand
early in the first round two.

4984
02:12:35,631 --> 02:12:36,590
It's one of the reasons why.

4985
02:12:36,650 --> 02:12:36,921
Yeah,

4986
02:12:36,921 --> 02:12:38,840
well it's also because he's trying,

4987
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:42,320
he's trying to swing for
the fences constantly.

4988
02:12:42,350 --> 02:12:42,800
Yeah.

4989
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:44,960
That's why he's gassed and
every one of his big fights,

4990
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,360
any fight that's got any
kind of distance to it,

4991
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:48,373
he's gassed.

4992
02:12:48,530 --> 02:12:48,980
Why?

4993
02:12:48,980 --> 02:12:50,690
Because that's the type of fighter he is.

4994
02:12:52,070 --> 02:12:53,300
Does that make them a bad fighter?

4995
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:54,440
Not necessarily.

4996
02:12:54,590 --> 02:12:55,530
I would say it doesn't.

4997
02:12:55,580 --> 02:12:56,870
It's just that's who he is.

4998
02:12:56,930 --> 02:12:57,950
He's a fucking wild man.

4999
02:12:57,980 --> 02:13:02,980
But that's also why I think he will
never be a UFC champion because there's a

5000
02:13:03,141 --> 02:13:05,030
finesse the he doesn't possess.

5001
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:07,070
But don't you think that
that's something you can learn?

5002
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:07,311
I mean,

5003
02:13:07,311 --> 02:13:10,190
he's a guy who is still sort
of evolving as a fighter.

5004
02:13:10,191 --> 02:13:11,024
He has him,

5005
02:13:11,210 --> 02:13:11,361
well,

5006
02:13:11,361 --> 02:13:13,700
he came into MMA fairly late.

5007
02:13:13,730 --> 02:13:15,940
It was a basketball player and what will,

5008
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:16,191
I mean,

5009
02:13:16,191 --> 02:13:16,850
time will tell.

5010
02:13:16,850 --> 02:13:18,020
It's up to him really.

5011
02:13:18,110 --> 02:13:19,610
And I've got a personal thing with him.

5012
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:20,210
Well,

5013
02:13:20,210 --> 02:13:22,970
but here I'm being objective and that is,

5014
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:24,253
it's up to him.

5015
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:26,210
If he wants to make those decisions,

5016
02:13:26,211 --> 02:13:27,920
if he wants to change his game,

5017
02:13:27,921 --> 02:13:29,540
if he wants to add
different aspects to it,

5018
02:13:29,541 --> 02:13:34,541
I mean all fighters are the true
or architects of their own design.

5019
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:37,050
The coaches can help.

5020
02:13:37,051 --> 02:13:37,770
Edmund can,

5021
02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:42,770
can help him in one way and show him how
to strike under these concepts or maybe

5022
02:13:43,321 --> 02:13:47,340
show the same things that he's been
taught at Jackson's or someplace else but

5023
02:13:47,341 --> 02:13:50,250
said in a different way so that
it becomes more clear to him.

5024
02:13:50,550 --> 02:13:51,383
Um,

5025
02:13:51,390 --> 02:13:53,190
and I think Edmond is
a good striking coach.

5026
02:13:53,191 --> 02:13:54,330
I've seen him work with Rhonda.

5027
02:13:54,331 --> 02:13:55,200
I've seen him work with,

5028
02:13:55,201 --> 02:13:55,770
with some of the,

5029
02:13:55,770 --> 02:13:57,600
with the girls and uh,

5030
02:13:57,630 --> 02:13:58,171
before,

5031
02:13:58,171 --> 02:14:00,300
and I like what he has to teach.

5032
02:14:01,140 --> 02:14:06,140
I also don't believe that at Greg's that
there wasn't that there was any lack of

5033
02:14:06,271 --> 02:14:09,230
striking quality striking training or I,

5034
02:14:09,380 --> 02:14:12,210
I'm not going to say the Edmunds striking
training is going to be better than

5035
02:14:12,211 --> 02:14:13,740
whatever was it was Jackson's,

5036
02:14:13,741 --> 02:14:14,850
I'm going to say it's different.

5037
02:14:15,450 --> 02:14:15,871
I'm sure.

5038
02:14:15,871 --> 02:14:16,800
And I know it's good,

5039
02:14:16,801 --> 02:14:17,041
but I,

5040
02:14:17,041 --> 02:14:19,140
I'm pretty sure the Jacksons was good too.

5041
02:14:19,540 --> 02:14:21,090
And to make that change.

5042
02:14:21,091 --> 02:14:25,140
I mean only he knows specifically
why he decided to change camps.

5043
02:14:25,530 --> 02:14:25,951
But,

5044
02:14:25,951 --> 02:14:26,784
uh,

5045
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,440
in my opinion it's not,

5046
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:30,840
it's not about being here or there,

5047
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:33,150
it's about what he does to,

5048
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:34,680
to affect his game.

5049
02:14:34,681 --> 02:14:34,981
It's what,

5050
02:14:34,981 --> 02:14:37,350
what changes he decides
to make in his own head.

5051
02:14:37,351 --> 02:14:41,040
The way he approaches his training and
how he tries to take what he's learning

5052
02:14:41,430 --> 02:14:46,140
and apply it to what he does already
and apply it in different ways.

5053
02:14:46,590 --> 02:14:46,801
You know,

5054
02:14:46,801 --> 02:14:47,940
that's what it comes down to.

5055
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:51,720
I think Edmonds given them
more individualized attention
and really focusing on

5056
02:14:51,721 --> 02:14:56,721
him as an athlete because he only
has a small stable of fighters maybe.

5057
02:14:57,060 --> 02:14:57,893
But uh,

5058
02:14:58,230 --> 02:14:59,063
in the end,

5059
02:14:59,190 --> 02:14:59,610
uh,

5060
02:14:59,610 --> 02:15:02,610
coaches lay the foundation,

5061
02:15:02,611 --> 02:15:02,881
they,

5062
02:15:02,881 --> 02:15:03,180
they,

5063
02:15:03,180 --> 02:15:04,710
they point you in the right direction,

5064
02:15:05,010 --> 02:15:09,090
but athletes take that information
and they make the most of it.

5065
02:15:09,690 --> 02:15:10,710
If you,

5066
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:13,290
how much time in a day can
you spend with that coach?

5067
02:15:13,650 --> 02:15:14,550
Only so much.

5068
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:16,740
It's the time that you're
not spending with them.

5069
02:15:16,890 --> 02:15:18,390
That really makes a big difference.

5070
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:20,970
How do you take what they gave you?

5071
02:15:20,971 --> 02:15:23,160
How are you working on that
when you're not in the gym?

5072
02:15:23,161 --> 02:15:24,090
How are you thinking about it?

5073
02:15:24,091 --> 02:15:26,850
How are you breaking down your
strengths and your weaknesses and,

5074
02:15:26,970 --> 02:15:27,960
and dealing with those?

5075
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:33,560
How are you then coming back to the gym
with that knowledge and then training

5076
02:15:35,191 --> 02:15:36,024
the next day?

5077
02:15:36,180 --> 02:15:40,110
How are you setting your
mind for training that day?

5078
02:15:40,140 --> 02:15:40,381
You know,

5079
02:15:40,381 --> 02:15:41,610
you could have the worst day in the world,

5080
02:15:41,611 --> 02:15:42,960
but if your jab got better,

5081
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:44,093
so what,

5082
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:44,461
right.

5083
02:15:44,461 --> 02:15:45,294
It's a success.

5084
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:46,110
Does it,

5085
02:15:46,110 --> 02:15:47,910
does it bug you that fine?

5086
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:48,980
Like if you,

5087
02:15:49,010 --> 02:15:49,291
you know,

5088
02:15:49,291 --> 02:15:53,160
you look back in the fact that you didn't
get up for it and you had that result.

5089
02:15:53,310 --> 02:15:53,671
Yes,

5090
02:15:53,671 --> 02:15:56,010
of course it bugs me and it just,

5091
02:15:56,011 --> 02:16:01,011
as Travis has bugged from losing his
fight versus virgin because he had an

5092
02:16:01,801 --> 02:16:03,990
opportunity to fight for
the title after that,

5093
02:16:03,991 --> 02:16:05,130
I'm sure is the way he saw it.

5094
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:06,980
And he lost his opportunity here.

5095
02:16:06,990 --> 02:16:07,290
He,

5096
02:16:07,290 --> 02:16:08,080
he may feel it was,

5097
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:09,570
it was hand or you know,

5098
02:16:09,571 --> 02:16:11,370
when he got kicked in
the ribs or whatever.

5099
02:16:11,371 --> 02:16:13,110
It doesn't really matter what it was.

5100
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:14,640
We lost.

5101
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:16,740
We lost in these moments.

5102
02:16:16,890 --> 02:16:17,730
And as a fighter,

5103
02:16:17,731 --> 02:16:19,260
you always should.

5104
02:16:19,860 --> 02:16:20,191
That's,

5105
02:16:20,191 --> 02:16:25,110
that's something that I know when
I don't care if I lost or not,

5106
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:26,670
that's when I should stop fighting.

5107
02:16:27,210 --> 02:16:28,043
I cared.

5108
02:16:28,050 --> 02:16:29,320
I cared that I lost,

5109
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:33,310
I cared a lot more when I
got disrespected over it,

5110
02:16:33,311 --> 02:16:35,770
which I felt was completely unnecessary.

5111
02:16:35,771 --> 02:16:36,460
That's just suck.

5112
02:16:36,460 --> 02:16:37,120
That was like,

5113
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:37,691
wow.

5114
02:16:37,691 --> 02:16:38,290
Wow.

5115
02:16:38,290 --> 02:16:38,801
Why?

5116
02:16:38,801 --> 02:16:39,840
Why did you have to do that?

5117
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:41,530
So if you got you can't,

5118
02:16:41,531 --> 02:16:43,360
you have a hard time
getting up for Travis.

5119
02:16:43,390 --> 02:16:45,880
Why do you not have a hard
time getting up for Roy Nelson?

5120
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:46,780
Because

5121
02:16:47,170 --> 02:16:48,003
for one,

5122
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:49,113
uh,

5123
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:50,240
I've had some time to,

5124
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:55,150
to just do other stuff and get that fire
wanting to get back in the ring too.

5125
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:56,171
I'm not looking at,

5126
02:16:56,171 --> 02:16:56,831
I'm looking at funding.

5127
02:16:56,831 --> 02:16:57,730
Roy's fighting Roy.

5128
02:16:57,940 --> 02:17:02,320
I'm not looking at fighting Roy as I'm
fighting Roy so that I can prove that I

5129
02:17:02,321 --> 02:17:07,210
can fight Joe Smith next so that I can
fight whoever and then get a title shot.

5130
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:08,530
I'm not doing that.

5131
02:17:08,740 --> 02:17:10,630
I'm fighting Roy because I'm fighting Roy.

5132
02:17:11,050 --> 02:17:11,591
Me and Roy,

5133
02:17:11,591 --> 02:17:12,370
you're going to fight.

5134
02:17:12,370 --> 02:17:12,851
So you have a,

5135
02:17:12,851 --> 02:17:14,590
just a different mindset
than you had before.

5136
02:17:14,591 --> 02:17:15,180
The trout was for.

5137
02:17:15,180 --> 02:17:15,820
Absolutely.

5138
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:17,770
And with Roy,

5139
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:20,890
he's been around a very long time himself.

5140
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:23,140
And so I've heard things here and there,

5141
02:17:23,410 --> 02:17:23,651
you know,

5142
02:17:23,651 --> 02:17:28,651
really one time it was on a
big rant online on Twitter
about people being ranked

5143
02:17:29,801 --> 02:17:30,880
over him and why,

5144
02:17:30,881 --> 02:17:31,570
why is that?

5145
02:17:31,570 --> 02:17:31,931
So he's,

5146
02:17:31,931 --> 02:17:35,470
he's arguing with all these
major journalists and then
he starts adding my name

5147
02:17:35,471 --> 02:17:35,771
into it.

5148
02:17:35,771 --> 02:17:38,620
Like literally putting my
handle and I'm just like,

5149
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:40,230
why do you give a fuck about,

5150
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:41,590
in my only response was,

5151
02:17:41,591 --> 02:17:42,160
you know,

5152
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:44,680
finding wants to talk about how he
thinks he's better than me or whatever.

5153
02:17:44,681 --> 02:17:45,514
Who Cares?

5154
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:48,010
My only response was who gives a shit?

5155
02:17:48,011 --> 02:17:49,240
What other people think about you?

5156
02:17:49,570 --> 02:17:51,100
Why are you even including me in this?

5157
02:17:51,101 --> 02:17:51,934
It doesn't matter.

5158
02:17:52,090 --> 02:17:52,531
Was there anything,

5159
02:17:52,531 --> 02:17:54,450
he's just trying to drum
up fight or whatever.

5160
02:17:54,451 --> 02:17:55,231
It doesn't matter.

5161
02:17:55,231 --> 02:17:57,090
It looks at list of potential opponents.

5162
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:58,860
It feels he matches up well with you.

5163
02:17:58,861 --> 02:18:00,000
Throw your name into the mix.

5164
02:18:00,001 --> 02:18:00,460
Use Your,

5165
02:18:00,460 --> 02:18:02,940
you're at Shell Barnett,

5166
02:18:03,090 --> 02:18:03,670
you know at,

5167
02:18:03,670 --> 02:18:04,231
at the time,

5168
02:18:04,231 --> 02:18:06,360
I don't even think I was in the UFC
so it's not like we could have fought

5169
02:18:06,361 --> 02:18:07,194
anyways.

5170
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:07,841
Well,

5171
02:18:07,841 --> 02:18:10,240
he probably knew you were
coming over from Strikeforce.

5172
02:18:10,241 --> 02:18:10,750
Right.

5173
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:11,110
Who knows?

5174
02:18:11,110 --> 02:18:12,750
Everybody thought you
were coming over a few,

5175
02:18:12,760 --> 02:18:13,593
not work out the deal.

5176
02:18:13,900 --> 02:18:14,081
I mean,

5177
02:18:14,081 --> 02:18:15,850
you were always a top level guy,

5178
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:16,350
right?

5179
02:18:16,350 --> 02:18:20,710
It's sub someone that a lot of different
fighters wanted to have as a potential.

5180
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:21,301
You were,

5181
02:18:21,301 --> 02:18:21,481
hi,

5182
02:18:21,481 --> 02:18:22,150
my name,

5183
02:18:22,150 --> 02:18:22,510
you know,

5184
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:23,350
high marquee.

5185
02:18:23,740 --> 02:18:27,730
It wasn't that long ago that anybody
ever started actually calling me out.

5186
02:18:28,150 --> 02:18:29,080
Like most of my career.

5187
02:18:29,081 --> 02:18:29,771
No one's ever said,

5188
02:18:29,771 --> 02:18:30,640
I want to fight that guy.

5189
02:18:32,310 --> 02:18:32,930
So what,

5190
02:18:32,930 --> 02:18:33,850
what do you attribute it to?

5191
02:18:34,060 --> 02:18:34,361
Oh,

5192
02:18:34,361 --> 02:18:34,991
I'm older.

5193
02:18:34,991 --> 02:18:35,890
I had a bad loss,

5194
02:18:35,891 --> 02:18:36,730
my last match.

5195
02:18:36,731 --> 02:18:36,911
You know,

5196
02:18:36,911 --> 02:18:38,320
maybe they think that they see it's,

5197
02:18:38,321 --> 02:18:38,950
uh,

5198
02:18:38,950 --> 02:18:40,390
it's more worthwhile to do that.

5199
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:43,870
But even guys that had gotten wins over
me went through fucking hell to do it.

5200
02:18:44,530 --> 02:18:46,040
So there isn't,

5201
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:46,933
yeah,

5202
02:18:47,060 --> 02:18:47,893
it doesn't make sense.

5203
02:18:48,280 --> 02:18:49,113
I don't blame them.

5204
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:49,810
I mean,

5205
02:18:49,810 --> 02:18:50,643
I don't,

5206
02:18:50,890 --> 02:18:52,000
if I see a guy,

5207
02:18:52,810 --> 02:18:56,110
if I have a fighter and I can avoid
having a fight that's winnable,

5208
02:18:56,410 --> 02:18:58,030
but it's going to be fucking really tough.

5209
02:18:58,280 --> 02:18:58,620
Yeah.

5210
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:00,690
I would try not to make
that fight happened.

5211
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:03,340
I would try to get them
a fight where it may be,

5212
02:19:04,650 --> 02:19:05,483
uh,

5213
02:19:05,510 --> 02:19:06,700
a more dangerous fight,

5214
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:07,930
but much more,

5215
02:19:08,460 --> 02:19:09,100
uh,

5216
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:11,290
skews in the way of once you get going,

5217
02:19:11,291 --> 02:19:12,430
you can put them away,

5218
02:19:12,940 --> 02:19:15,340
but you got to watch out because
this guy can put you away.

5219
02:19:15,341 --> 02:19:20,341
Versus this guy's going to make you fight
and scratch and claw for every inch of

5220
02:19:20,441 --> 02:19:22,210
every second of this fucking match.

5221
02:19:22,390 --> 02:19:23,860
Whether he's winning and he's losing,

5222
02:19:23,890 --> 02:19:25,840
he'll just never fucking quit like that.

5223
02:19:26,230 --> 02:19:26,770
Yeah.

5224
02:19:26,770 --> 02:19:27,560
And that's you.

5225
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:27,920
I will,

5226
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:32,090
I break my hand and 23 seconds finding
Cormier and I still hit him with it.

5227
02:19:32,270 --> 02:19:33,103
You know what I mean?

5228
02:19:34,420 --> 02:19:38,530
And this is a type of fight that you
think would be that kind of dog fight.

5229
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:39,393
You and Roy?

5230
02:19:39,470 --> 02:19:39,790
Yeah.

5231
02:19:39,790 --> 02:19:39,971
Well,

5232
02:19:39,971 --> 02:19:40,990
he's hard to put away.

5233
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:41,990
He is hard to find.

5234
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:42,853
I'm a finisher.

5235
02:19:43,030 --> 02:19:46,590
She's just crisis fight with Alistair
Overeem was crazy to watch him.

5236
02:19:46,610 --> 02:19:47,311
I didn't see it,

5237
02:19:47,311 --> 02:19:47,500
you know,

5238
02:19:47,500 --> 02:19:49,600
but I heard this kicks to the body,

5239
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:51,180
saw walk,

5240
02:19:51,220 --> 02:19:52,390
saw walk.

5241
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:52,790
You know,

5242
02:19:52,790 --> 02:19:54,400
Alistair was just laying into him.

5243
02:19:54,580 --> 02:19:55,840
He had kicked him,

5244
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:56,710
he hit,

5245
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:58,420
he kicked the shit out of his legs.

5246
02:19:58,421 --> 02:20:00,070
And Roy just keeps coming forward.

5247
02:20:00,460 --> 02:20:02,300
Alice just says it was
like the incredible hulk.

5248
02:20:02,301 --> 02:20:06,070
Like he just got angrier and angrier
and angrier and see his eyes get crazy.

5249
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:07,600
He's a wild motherfucker Roy.

5250
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:08,080
Yeah.

5251
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:11,080
Hard to believe that he didn't even
start striking training till 2009.

5252
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:12,810
That's when he started striking try.

5253
02:20:12,820 --> 02:20:13,630
That's not true.

5254
02:20:13,630 --> 02:20:14,450
That's what he said.

5255
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:14,680
What?

5256
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:15,950
He had to come food background too.

5257
02:20:16,420 --> 02:20:17,253
Oh,

5258
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:18,533
did it really?

5259
02:20:18,550 --> 02:20:19,000
Yes.

5260
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:19,261
I mean,

5261
02:20:19,261 --> 02:20:19,990
but what does it,

5262
02:20:19,990 --> 02:20:20,823
what does that

5263
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:21,940
look?

5264
02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:24,040
He know he knew about
throwing a punch like this.

5265
02:20:24,041 --> 02:20:26,010
I saw him overhand.

5266
02:20:26,011 --> 02:20:26,291
Right.

5267
02:20:26,291 --> 02:20:27,280
A guy and knock them out.

5268
02:20:27,490 --> 02:20:28,450
And Costa Rica.

5269
02:20:28,780 --> 02:20:29,290
Really?

5270
02:20:29,290 --> 02:20:29,650
Oh yeah.

5271
02:20:29,650 --> 02:20:30,400
Costa Rica.

5272
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:30,670
Yup.

5273
02:20:30,670 --> 02:20:31,503
You guys drunk.

5274
02:20:34,150 --> 02:20:34,691
What happened?

5275
02:20:34,691 --> 02:20:35,350
Well,

5276
02:20:35,350 --> 02:20:39,100
we were hired to go down there to
provide protection for something.

5277
02:20:39,110 --> 02:20:39,943
I'm just kidding.

5278
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:41,433
What was it?

5279
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:44,710
Oh dog dog when he was fighting.

5280
02:20:44,740 --> 02:20:45,190
Oh,

5281
02:20:45,190 --> 02:20:46,960
2007.

5282
02:20:46,990 --> 02:20:51,130
Eight dog was a fucking
interesting little scenario,

5283
02:20:51,131 --> 02:20:51,640
wasn't it?

5284
02:20:51,640 --> 02:20:52,210
It was.

5285
02:20:52,210 --> 02:20:52,600
I was,

5286
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:56,500
I actually really liked watching it
because their production in terms of,

5287
02:20:56,940 --> 02:20:57,773
uh,

5288
02:20:58,390 --> 02:21:00,450
setting up each individual fight.

5289
02:21:00,470 --> 02:21:00,551
Oh,

5290
02:21:00,551 --> 02:21:01,001
by the way,

5291
02:21:01,001 --> 02:21:06,001
which is funny because my buddy Clint
doll did this thing called venom way back

5292
02:21:06,341 --> 02:21:09,130
in the day and it was
not legal in California.

5293
02:21:09,131 --> 02:21:10,900
So what they did is they
rented out a soundstage.

5294
02:21:10,930 --> 02:21:11,680
I was there.

5295
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:12,300
You were at Vienna?

5296
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:13,133
I was at venom.

5297
02:21:13,230 --> 02:21:14,063
So you remember them?

5298
02:21:14,100 --> 02:21:14,890
Yeah.

5299
02:21:14,890 --> 02:21:15,420
Tell us.

5300
02:21:15,420 --> 02:21:19,390
It explained the whole
soundstage and he hires John,

5301
02:21:19,391 --> 02:21:23,170
Sally and Steven Quadros
to be the announcers.

5302
02:21:23,620 --> 02:21:28,300
He's got all these fights set up that
they're all going to film in one or two

5303
02:21:28,301 --> 02:21:33,190
days and then they're going to
prepackage it to go to sell it elsewhere.

5304
02:21:33,340 --> 02:21:35,620
He set up roving cams,

5305
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:36,670
hard Cam's,

5306
02:21:36,671 --> 02:21:37,840
he set up all this stuff.

5307
02:21:37,900 --> 02:21:41,260
He had all these people just show
up as extra to just stand around.

5308
02:21:41,261 --> 02:21:43,000
Which I guess you were
there hanging out too.

5309
02:21:43,001 --> 02:21:44,860
They ordered pizzas for
people to eat if the,

5310
02:21:44,861 --> 02:21:45,694
at one point,

5311
02:21:46,270 --> 02:21:48,970
and they call this thing a production,

5312
02:21:48,971 --> 02:21:49,540
you know,

5313
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:51,040
in terms of a film,

5314
02:21:51,370 --> 02:21:51,880
it's a film.

5315
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:52,713
It's a movie.

5316
02:21:52,780 --> 02:21:53,950
So he had these people fight,

5317
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:55,870
pretending that it was like acting.

5318
02:21:55,930 --> 02:21:56,260
Yeah.

5319
02:21:56,260 --> 02:21:58,120
I mean while they were fighting for real.

5320
02:21:58,150 --> 02:21:58,481
Yeah.

5321
02:21:58,481 --> 02:21:59,560
But they just had it,

5322
02:22:00,010 --> 02:22:00,341
well,

5323
02:22:00,341 --> 02:22:03,610
it's acting sparring
as actors or something.

5324
02:22:04,090 --> 02:22:06,910
They tried some wacky
loophole and it worked.

5325
02:22:06,970 --> 02:22:08,980
And so did they get in trouble though?

5326
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:09,970
I don't think so.

5327
02:22:09,971 --> 02:22:11,530
It's just that it never went anywhere.

5328
02:22:11,710 --> 02:22:12,461
To my understanding,

5329
02:22:12,461 --> 02:22:17,461
Sally was supposed to get it to the Fox
people and I don't know what happened

5330
02:22:17,651 --> 02:22:18,220
there.

5331
02:22:18,220 --> 02:22:18,641
It never,

5332
02:22:18,641 --> 02:22:20,680
it never took off either way.

5333
02:22:20,980 --> 02:22:21,431
One,

5334
02:22:21,431 --> 02:22:25,560
a lot of people got their start
there and nobody even knows it to.

5335
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:26,813
Uh,

5336
02:22:27,150 --> 02:22:29,670
what they did is the way
they filmed all the fighters,

5337
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:31,410
they had all of their bio's,

5338
02:22:31,411 --> 02:22:33,510
these backstories they had Mike,

5339
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:33,961
uh,

5340
02:22:33,961 --> 02:22:34,681
what's his face?

5341
02:22:34,681 --> 02:22:39,681
Mike seal from New Mexico who was a bank
robber in Mexico and he got in trouble

5342
02:22:40,501 --> 02:22:41,970
for that and came Amy.

5343
02:22:41,990 --> 02:22:43,920
So there's all these
stories about these guys.

5344
02:22:44,190 --> 02:22:47,040
And so how Bodog got a hold.

5345
02:22:47,250 --> 02:22:51,570
They use the same format partially
because one of the duties it was pro

5346
02:22:51,630 --> 02:22:56,340
producing Bodog have venom from way back
in the day and basically just took the

5347
02:22:56,341 --> 02:23:00,140
whole concept of how they would
produce it and use it for Botox.

5348
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:03,420
Would they would put on fights on
the beach and close to regrow loans,

5349
02:23:03,421 --> 02:23:05,730
hot chicks around best ring girls.

5350
02:23:05,731 --> 02:23:06,550
Just about everyone.

5351
02:23:06,550 --> 02:23:08,740
My God is that paper view.

5352
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:09,600
I can't remember.

5353
02:23:09,601 --> 02:23:11,630
I remember watching on TV,

5354
02:23:11,670 --> 02:23:12,460
it was on TV,

5355
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:14,250
so they shot it as a TV product.

5356
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:18,270
They would shoot all these fights over
four days and then they would chop it up

5357
02:23:18,271 --> 02:23:20,510
and the TV episodes and uh,

5358
02:23:21,230 --> 02:23:21,620
it was,

5359
02:23:21,620 --> 02:23:24,120
it looked really fucking cool
because they just run out of money.

5360
02:23:24,150 --> 02:23:25,740
They basically,

5361
02:23:25,741 --> 02:23:25,980
the Ph,

5362
02:23:25,980 --> 02:23:30,600
there was a lot of people involved in
Bodog that were basically just robbing the

5363
02:23:30,601 --> 02:23:31,860
coffers while the king sleeps.

5364
02:23:31,861 --> 02:23:34,950
They were just running it dry thinking
it was just going to be a failure who

5365
02:23:35,010 --> 02:23:38,370
just get all you can while
you can and just fuck it over.

5366
02:23:38,371 --> 02:23:38,940
And they did.

5367
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:40,710
They used to do those billboards,

5368
02:23:41,070 --> 02:23:41,551
Calvin,

5369
02:23:41,551 --> 02:23:45,870
I or presents Bodog so it'd be
handled dog fights like on a throne.

5370
02:23:45,900 --> 02:23:49,020
It'd be him with like a
beautiful suit on his face.

5371
02:23:49,021 --> 02:23:51,570
Like nobody's buying the
fights to look at you.

5372
02:23:51,850 --> 02:23:52,651
You didn't make any sense.

5373
02:23:52,651 --> 02:23:53,490
It was such a vanity.

5374
02:23:53,491 --> 02:23:53,851
It was,

5375
02:23:53,851 --> 02:23:54,090
yeah,

5376
02:23:54,090 --> 02:23:55,980
it was definitely retarded in that way.

5377
02:23:55,981 --> 02:23:56,814
But uh,

5378
02:23:57,030 --> 02:23:58,380
but I have really was down there.

5379
02:23:58,381 --> 02:24:02,280
He fought a Mario Renaldi knocked them
out with and ride out with an overhand

5380
02:24:02,281 --> 02:24:02,431
rule.

5381
02:24:02,431 --> 02:24:03,390
He always could punch.

5382
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:04,710
I just don't think he was training it.

5383
02:24:05,550 --> 02:24:05,931
Well,

5384
02:24:05,931 --> 02:24:06,764
according to him,

5385
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:08,880
I don't buy that list.

5386
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,490
He also used to weigh like two 20,

5387
02:24:11,491 --> 02:24:12,324
two 15.

5388
02:24:12,400 --> 02:24:12,770
Anything.

5389
02:24:12,770 --> 02:24:13,603
Frank Mir and uh,

5390
02:24:13,650 --> 02:24:14,610
grappling contest.

5391
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:15,330
Remember that?

5392
02:24:15,330 --> 02:24:15,451
Yeah.

5393
02:24:15,451 --> 02:24:15,781
What did it,

5394
02:24:15,781 --> 02:24:17,970
what happened was he from
near was all over him.

5395
02:24:17,971 --> 02:24:19,110
Like fucking white on rice,

5396
02:24:19,250 --> 02:24:21,960
got tired and then Roy
just outscored them.

5397
02:24:22,290 --> 02:24:22,921
But what happened?

5398
02:24:22,921 --> 02:24:23,250
Why did it,

5399
02:24:23,250 --> 02:24:23,640
what,

5400
02:24:23,640 --> 02:24:27,690
what did Roy do that made them gain all
that weight and keep it on while he's

5401
02:24:27,691 --> 02:24:28,470
getting in shape?

5402
02:24:28,470 --> 02:24:29,400
That's what I don't understand.

5403
02:24:29,401 --> 02:24:29,701
I don't think,

5404
02:24:29,701 --> 02:24:30,810
it's not what he did.

5405
02:24:30,811 --> 02:24:32,100
It's what he never stopped doing.

5406
02:24:32,101 --> 02:24:32,610
You know,

5407
02:24:32,610 --> 02:24:33,443
I don't,

5408
02:24:33,690 --> 02:24:36,540
I just don't know how you
could be in good enough shape.

5409
02:24:36,810 --> 02:24:40,770
We can go three hard five minute
rounds and not lose that gut.

5410
02:24:41,430 --> 02:24:41,970
I Dunno,

5411
02:24:41,970 --> 02:24:43,200
you had a fuel that God,

5412
02:24:43,201 --> 02:24:44,070
that God has got to be.

5413
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:46,170
He said he's working on that thing there.

5414
02:24:46,230 --> 02:24:51,230
Maybe there's a little tape forms in
there and use an engine inside that just

5415
02:24:51,241 --> 02:24:51,931
keeps them going.

5416
02:24:51,931 --> 02:24:52,051
Well,

5417
02:24:52,051 --> 02:24:52,920
there's a lot of padding.

5418
02:24:52,921 --> 02:24:54,060
I'll tell you that c eight,

5419
02:24:54,061 --> 02:24:56,040
those fucking Alistair
Overeem potty kicks.

5420
02:24:56,041 --> 02:24:57,950
I don't even think that
pattern can make that big.

5421
02:24:57,980 --> 02:24:58,350
That's it.

5422
02:24:58,350 --> 02:25:02,180
That's just being strong and tough shit.

5423
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:03,113
Yeah.

5424
02:25:03,210 --> 02:25:04,110
Well that'll be a good fight,

5425
02:25:04,111 --> 02:25:04,440
man.

5426
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:05,460
I would like to see that fight.

5427
02:25:05,690 --> 02:25:06,360
I you still do.

5428
02:25:06,360 --> 02:25:08,490
I think it'll be entertaining
if it'll actually happen yet.

5429
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:09,120
Uh,

5430
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:09,960
I think it will,

5431
02:25:09,961 --> 02:25:10,381
but yeah,

5432
02:25:10,381 --> 02:25:11,270
we'll have to see once,

5433
02:25:11,300 --> 02:25:13,320
once we have paperwork
and we have wet ink,

5434
02:25:14,310 --> 02:25:15,000
ink,

5435
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:15,720
ink.

5436
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:16,553
What works.

5437
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:16,781
All right,

5438
02:25:16,781 --> 02:25:17,790
we gotta get the fuck out of here.

5439
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:18,211
Uh,

5440
02:25:18,211 --> 02:25:20,670
Josh l Barnett on Twitter.

5441
02:25:21,210 --> 02:25:21,960
Um,

5442
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:25,480
anything else you want tell the fine
people about before we get the fuck up out

5443
02:25:25,481 --> 02:25:26,021
this bitch.

5444
02:25:26,021 --> 02:25:28,900
Check me out on axis and progresses.

5445
02:25:29,320 --> 02:25:30,010
No,

5446
02:25:30,010 --> 02:25:31,450
I am not good.

5447
02:25:31,480 --> 02:25:33,040
You couldn't do it the
way I wanted to do it.

5448
02:25:33,070 --> 02:25:33,701
So I said,

5449
02:25:33,701 --> 02:25:35,030
if that that's not fast,

5450
02:25:35,050 --> 02:25:35,681
not capable,

5451
02:25:35,681 --> 02:25:36,760
then I'm just not going to do it.

5452
02:25:36,850 --> 02:25:37,840
Let's just do it on your own.

5453
02:25:38,020 --> 02:25:39,790
Do it the way you want to
do a lot of fucking work.

5454
02:25:39,791 --> 02:25:40,061
Dude,

5455
02:25:40,061 --> 02:25:40,870
you should know.

5456
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:41,680
Listen man,

5457
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:42,610
this is all you need.

5458
02:25:42,820 --> 02:25:43,510
Get a phone,

5459
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:44,500
start talking into it.

5460
02:25:44,650 --> 02:25:45,483
Talk Shit.

5461
02:25:45,810 --> 02:25:48,760
I bloated online called
the Josh Barnett podcasts.

5462
02:25:48,910 --> 02:25:49,690
Take it from there.

5463
02:25:49,690 --> 02:25:49,871
Yeah,

5464
02:25:49,871 --> 02:25:49,931
I,

5465
02:25:49,931 --> 02:25:50,210
I,

5466
02:25:50,210 --> 02:25:50,591
you know,

5467
02:25:50,591 --> 02:25:51,880
I did some good things on it,

5468
02:25:51,881 --> 02:25:52,361
but uh,

5469
02:25:52,361 --> 02:25:53,194
it wasn't,

5470
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:54,930
there was a lot of stuff that,

5471
02:25:55,060 --> 02:25:57,760
that just wasn't allowing it to
it to really be what it could be.

5472
02:25:57,900 --> 02:25:59,820
All things in their own time,

5473
02:25:59,821 --> 02:26:00,481
my friend,

5474
02:26:00,481 --> 02:26:02,100
all things in their own time.

5475
02:26:02,310 --> 02:26:04,080
Josh l Bar Net,

5476
02:26:04,170 --> 02:26:05,750
motherfuckers watch him.

5477
02:26:05,770 --> 02:26:07,890
Metamorris it'll be May 9th,

5478
02:26:08,100 --> 02:26:11,160
May 9th May 9th really
interesting against Cyborg.

5479
02:26:11,480 --> 02:26:12,151
How do you say his last name?

5480
02:26:12,151 --> 02:26:14,250
But I've only seen it written.

5481
02:26:14,251 --> 02:26:15,640
I've never actually said it a brew.

5482
02:26:16,170 --> 02:26:17,440
I've heard it anyway.

5483
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:19,130
He's in the amazing Jujitsu fighter.

5484
02:26:19,131 --> 02:26:20,490
It'd be a fantastic match.

5485
02:26:20,910 --> 02:26:21,511
Josh Barnett,

5486
02:26:21,511 --> 02:26:22,051
Ladies and gentlemen,

5487
02:26:22,051 --> 02:26:22,490
