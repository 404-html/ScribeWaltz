1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,970
Yes.
And we're live.

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,230
Mike Baker,
how are you sir?

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,430
I am too.
I'm very well thank you.

4
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:11,810
Very happy to be coming back,
man.

5
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,460
Appreciate it.
Good to see Ya.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,533
This world's in chaos.
We need to talk to a rational man like 

7
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:21,371
yourself who's got the inside scoop.
I have never been built that way before,

8
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:25,430
but thank you.
That's a bonus in this irrational world.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,110
Your rationality,
you,

10
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,080
you're,
you're deemed a rational man.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,280
That's what we,
we've been lowering the bar,

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,733
lowering our expectations.
We were talking before the show started 

13
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:39,690
about the current cover of the economist
that has Donald Trump dressed up like,

14
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:42,260
because Uncle Sam and it just says 
really,

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,910
it's perfect.
You know,

16
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:48,620
and it's what you want to say to 
everybody who has jumped that chasm.

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,990
Right?
I had a stand that everybody's upset.

18
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:53,180
People are angry people if for whatever 
their motivation,

19
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:54,014
right?
So there,

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,710
you know,
they get Jones got up,

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,450
look at that fucking cover.

22
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,990
This is what we're down to.

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,000
That's brilliant.
But how do you get to,

24
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,300
how do you get from,
okay,

25
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:09,210
he's entertaining and I understand that 
everybody wants to be entertained.

26
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:10,044
To some degree,
but how do you get to the point from 

27
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:13,410
saying it's entertaining to leader of 
the free world?

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,603
And that's the part that I can't 
understand when I talk to people who 

29
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:17,640
are,
are,

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,980
are absolutely supporting him.

31
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,403
Well,
you as a man who's been deep in the 

32
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,790
world of security or CIA operative,
you,

33
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,653
you've got the inside scoop would,
how this machine runs to a certain 

34
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:31,274
extent.
Don't you think that at this point it's 

35
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:34,814
so,
it's so complicated that almost no one 

36
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:40,610
wants to be president.
Like the,

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,553
the,
it's not a job that like people are 

38
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:44,800
scrambling to get any more,

39
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,290
right.
Nobody in their right mind would want to

40
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,300
put themselves through it or,
you know,

41
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:49,980
unless you're independently wealthy.
Yeah.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,360
Um,
and,

43
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,160
and uh,
and just don't care.

44
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,480
And there's,
there is,

45
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,200
I think you're right.
There's,

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,033
there's a,
you think about the kid who wants to 

47
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,720
become president of the young 
Republicans club right in,

48
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,950
in,
in middle school,

49
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,053
and then,
you know,

50
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,740
all through his life,
that's all he wants.

51
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,480
He wants to be an elected official 
somewhere.

52
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,314
So he goes maybe to the town council.
Then eventually in his big goal was to 

53
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:12,120
become a congressman and God forbid,
then he gets that and he goes on,

54
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,030
there's a certain personality type,
right,

55
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:18,930
that's way up its own ass that allows 
you to think that.

56
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:19,764
Yeah.
So I sh I should be president of the 

57
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:23,130
United States.
I look in the mirror every morning and I

58
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:23,581
think,
yes,

59
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:26,130
I should lead the free world.
So right there,

60
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:29,940
I think you've got a flaw in all the 
people who are pursuing elected office,

61
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,950
but then you've got the money that's 
behind it.

62
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,900
You've got,
you have to be independently wealthy.

63
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:36,210
I watched,
and not to disappear down a rabbit hole,

64
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:36,720
but,
uh,

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,760
I lived on the east coast before we 
moved out to Idaho,

66
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,310
which is a great state.
Oh my God.

67
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,390
It's a great,
beautiful.

68
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,791
It's,
it's,

69
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,291
it's,
no,

70
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,030
no,
no.

71
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,150
And if we probably shouldn't say 
anything

72
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,140
orphans,
I think it's flat or something.

73
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:49,960
If I had this conversation with these 
two guys,

74
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,100
yeah.

75
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,420
About it.
And they were like,

76
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,171
well,
you know,

77
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:56,040
it's mostly farms,
like what it is.

78
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,870
I mean there's a lot of code,
there's a lot of agriculture,

79
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:59,350
but you know what,
he has more,

80
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,350
if you,
here's a,

81
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,680
here's an interesting fact about Idaho.
People can write this down.

82
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,723
If you took an iron and iron,
Idaho flat and then you did that with 

83
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:08,134
all the other states,
the only way the state that would be 

84
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:12,520
bigger would be Alaska.
And the same for river frontage,

85
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,210
right.
The river miles of rafting is,

86
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:15,400
is insane out there.
So,

87
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,150
but the point being,
I suppose it,

88
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:20,240
before we moved out there,
I was on the east coast and um,

89
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,930
my wife is involved in politics to some 
degree,

90
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:26,410
but we spent some time in Connecticut,
right watching,

91
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,231
uh,
the,

92
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:28,760
the governor race there.
Um,

93
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,330
and they would have to go from town 
council,

94
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:33,220
the town council,
it workspace that way.

95
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,053
I mean,
you have to get the vote of the 

96
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,180
Republican Party of the Democratic Party
in the town council.

97
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,970
And the first question any of them would
ever ask was,

98
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,220
can you self fund?
Basically,

99
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,020
you know,
how much money do you have?

100
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,243
And so you put that together with the 
idea that nobody wants to open their 

101
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:53,260
family up to the ridiculous scrutiny 
that's involved and you,

102
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,103
yeah,
you did.

103
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,480
We get what we get.
We get this,

104
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:58,600
this crazed campaign season.
Yeah.

105
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,434
It seems like we're down the assholes.
It's only people who want to be it and 

106
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,540
Bernie Sanders is just,
I mean,

107
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,270
he's kind of an old Kook.
I don't think he's an asshole.

108
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,510
I think he's got all these asshole.
He seems like a nice guy actually with a

109
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:13,380
lot of good ideas socially and I dunno.
I Dunno.

110
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,680
It just,
it's like,

111
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,010
it's the biggest example in my opinion,
of picking the lesser evil.

112
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,410
That's how I'm looking at this campaign.
It's like,

113
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:24,244
what's the lesser evil?
It's going to be Hillary Clinton who 

114
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:28,660
basically I just,
I can't,

115
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,153
I don't,
I don't feel any sincerity from her at 

116
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:33,310
all.
It's so hard.

117
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,293
She's been in the business for so long.
She's been involved in politics for so 

118
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:40,870
long.
I don't know if she knows how to be just

119
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:42,070
herself.
That's a good point.

120
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,610
I mean,
I,

121
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,580
my problem with Hillary is it's purely 
an operational one.

122
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,810
I know that if I had handled,
I mean even in a conservative way,

123
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:50,644
if you look at what she did with the 
email server and her colleagues or 

124
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:54,520
cohorts did,
uh,

125
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,271
and,
and you say,

126
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:55,811
okay,
it's,

127
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:56,970
it's,
you know,

128
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:59,710
it and conservative way I'm looking at 
at how bad it was.

129
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,190
If I had done that,
I would have been sent to prison.

130
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,220
And I know because we had various 
counter intelligence operations and else

131
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,930
or you're,
you're trying to find the lake,

132
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:11,980
you're trying to find the problem.

133
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,100
And I,
you know,

134
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,953
you watch people get banged up for less 
egregious acts then what she's been 

135
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:18,980
involved in.
So my problem with Hillary is looking,

136
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:20,920
you know,
you one set of rules for everybody,

137
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,590
right?
And you know,

138
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,180
David Petraeus is a good example.
He hands over some,

139
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,850
uh,
of information to his mistress who had a

140
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:31,510
security clearance and uh,
he gets a couple of years probation,

141
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,940
you know,
a large fine has to plead guilty.

142
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,193
Um,
she literally handed it over to the 

143
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:39,480
Chinese,
the Russians and any other state and non

144
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:43,720
state sponsored a hacker out there and 
explain which again,

145
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:47,400
for people who don't know,
she for whatever her motivations,

146
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:48,234
she initially said it was simply a 
matter of ease after saying that she 

147
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,290
didn't really know because it wasn't her
gig.

148
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,660
She set up a,
uh,

149
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,533
a private email server in her bathroom 
and the bathroom in her bathroom at her 

150
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:04,880
house in,
in a server in their bathroom.

151
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,430
I know that seems like a weird choice.
Well,

152
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,540
you know,
you're multitasking.

153
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,700
Maybe you don't have that much time in 
the day.

154
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,470
And she's constantly,
she did not use that excuse as I recall.

155
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,470
It still doesn't make sense.
It doesn't make any sense.

156
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,313
I know they like,
they'd have no extra rooms in the 

157
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:22,430
Clinton House.
It's a small place.

158
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,580
You made about $190 million over the 
last couple of years.

159
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,560
So we're supposed to believe she's 
living in a one bedroom,

160
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,850
one bath place,
you know,

161
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,400
800 square feet.
And so she,

162
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,353
she used this and essentially the 
problem is she traffic was directed 

163
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,190
through this unprotected,
uh,

164
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,460
server that now,
you know,

165
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,220
and she's arguing semantics,
she's saying,

166
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:44,054
well,
I never saw that it was classified and 

167
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,143
yet it's either classified or it's not,
and you know it at when and when you 

168
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,254
sign on to be,
whether it's a senior official at her 

169
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,164
level or,
or some milk that's walking around just 

170
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:00,200
carrying papers at the agency,
whatever it may be,

171
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,723
you sign agreements,
you that you will protect classified 

172
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:05,360
information.

173
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,670
And it doesn't say it has to be more 
classified.

174
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,743
It says that you are aware because you 
go through a briefing about what is and 

175
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:11,594
what is and,
and how you look at a piece of 

176
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:13,664
information to determine.
So she's saying it wasn't classified 

177
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:19,460
when she saw it or when it hit the 
server,

178
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,473
but what they were doing is essentially 
cutting and pasting from classified 

179
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:26,750
documents so that they could bypass 
traffic and what their motivation was.

180
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,430
I have no idea whether they thought it 
was quicker,

181
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:29,750
whether it was easier.
You know,

182
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:32,150
I don't read a lot of nefarious intent.
I just read,

183
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,313
uh,
an egregious mishandling of classified 

184
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:38,690
information that anybody else would be 
punished for.

185
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,980
And it's,
you know,

186
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:40,814
I don't think it's going to happen.
I think the bureau is engaged in a 

187
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:43,574
couple of different investigations.
I think they have all the information 

188
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,660
they would need to put the ordinary 
person,

189
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,680
you know,
uh,

190
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,940
or move for an indictment.

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,530
I just don't think the DOJ is going to 
do it.

192
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,470
So what is their motivation to ignore 
it?

193
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,860
Well,
I think it's,

194
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,340
I think it's political top cover because
there's not,

195
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,100
there's only one other person running 
for the Democratic Party.

196
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,680
Right.
A lot of people aren't too excited about

197
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,540
having Bernie Sanders become the 
president.

198
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,530
Right,
right.

199
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,430
And I mean,
again,

200
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:08,480
it's sort of,
you know,

201
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,051
the,
the,

202
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:09,884
the left makes fun of the Republicans as
they should because look what we've got 

203
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:13,400
is our front runner.
But,

204
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,630
uh,
you know,

205
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:16,250
they make fun of the idea that,
you know,

206
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,800
the Republicans were all upset because 
they're anointed one,

207
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:21,180
whether it's rubio or whomever you know,
is,

208
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:24,050
is in the dust right now it's the same 
way on the other side.

209
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:24,540
Right?
I mean they,

210
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,730
you know,
there's a lot of people,

211
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,230
you know,
with our knickers in a twist on the,

212
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,064
on the,
on the left upset that perhaps they are 

213
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:31,184
anointed one isn't going to get in.
If if whom Abbott in or one of her 

214
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:39,110
cohorts who was involved in this who 
also were being looked at in a very,

215
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:41,870
very serious way.
If one of them gets banged up for this,

216
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,240
then I don't know how it doesn't spread 
to her.

217
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,770
She was in charge and you know,
I understand that shit rolls downhill.

218
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,643
But anyway,
so that seems like the only way it 

219
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:53,780
wouldn't is the whole thing that we're 
talking about her in the first place,

220
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:56,100
that she's just so deeply entrenched

221
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,933
in the system.
She's so political and she's washed so 

222
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:00,900
many hands and you know,
they're,

223
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,973
they're all tied in together and this is
the fabric that sort of keeping her 

224
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:08,730
afloat right now.
Her whole sort of,

225
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,090
you know,
political operating mechanism.

226
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,313
I mean,
she's just so deeply entwined in the 

227
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:19,290
Washington system and that seems to be 
what's keeping her from,

228
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,153
I mean,
if this was going on and if somehow or 

229
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:24,690
another this was someone like trump,
someone who is an outsider,

230
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,370
Jesus Christ,
they would chase him down.

231
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,233
Yeah.
Forget about it.

232
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,110
I,
this is,

233
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,680
this is a remarkable situation.
Um,

234
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,690
somebody who's is a,
from it and I get it not taken away.

235
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:34,950
She's got a lot of experience.
Okay.

236
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,400
I understand that.
Um,

237
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,440
I liked,
you know,

238
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,060
Bill Clinton,
I liked the guy.

239
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:39,930
I thought he was a,
you know,

240
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:41,790
there was,
it was a lot of good things about him.

241
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,150
Uh,
it's just,

242
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,710
it's,
it's pretty,

243
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,590
it's pretty fucked up.
And I don't know how else to put it.

244
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,270
We've got trump on one side.
We've got,

245
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:53,820
we've got hillary under investigation on
the other side.

246
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:54,654
We've got Bernie Sanders and I get it.
I understand why people like Bernie 

247
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:57,210
because,
hey,

248
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,500
who wouldn't you like free stuff?
Free stuff is,

249
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,640
I'd give me some of that.
You know,

250
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,710
I've got three little boys I've got to 
put through college.

251
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:07,230
I mean,
so people feel like there's an imbalance

252
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,240
and they feel like this is the only guy 
that's saying,

253
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,740
hey,
it's imbalanced.

254
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,633
And the,
the people that understand economics or 

255
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:16,440
apparently upset at him,
I don't understand economics.

256
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:19,740
I'm lucky I don't have to,
but the people that,

257
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:20,574
you know,
if I was a fucking accountant and shoot 

258
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:22,590
myself,
I jump off a bridge.

259
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,080
But it,
the people that understand that are like

260
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:27,200
this guy's policy,
this is not going to work.

261
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,390
Like none of this is gonna work.
So that's an argument for other people.

262
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,620
But the people that feel like we got 
screwed in 2008 with the,

263
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,301
the,
you know,

264
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,910
the,
the whole bailout and the,

265
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:41,370
the banks and all the craziness with the
economic collapse,

266
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,050
they feel like at least some guys coming
along,

267
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:44,460
this is addressing that.
And he's the only one.

268
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:46,050
So that's what people are gravitating 
towards.

269
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,213
And there's a lot of social stuff like 
his gravitating towards the black lives 

270
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:51,144
matter movement and wanting to make 
medical marijuana legal and all that 

271
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:54,864
stuff that I understand too.
But it does not one person that stands 

272
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:00,330
out where I go,
there's my guy,

273
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,470
there's my God.
Yeah,

274
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,670
I agree.
100%.

275
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,901
100%.
Yeah.

276
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:04,890
I mean,
if you could take Bernie,

277
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:05,724
cause I think I,
I think one of the things people like 

278
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:09,120
about Sanders's,
he's been consistent over the years.

279
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,541
Yes.
Right.

280
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,580
So he's not,
he's not changing.

281
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,050
And,
and,

282
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:12,883
and again,
there is something to be said here or 

283
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:16,254
this political system where apparently 
you're not allowed to evolve your 

284
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:19,584
thinking.
Right.

285
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,030
So the,
I flip flopper yeah.

286
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:21,891
Oh my God.
Yeah.

287
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:22,724
Well you can't do that.
Or it's so that part of it or you can't 

288
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:28,500
negotiate a compromise as if somehow 
that's a weakness.

289
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,780
Negotiating and compromising is how you 
get shit done,

290
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,400
whether it's in government or business.
But,

291
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,110
so anyway,
I had to stamp people like sanders.

292
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,010
They like his,
his,

293
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:36,360
uh,
his consistency.

294
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,000
Um,
I understand the social side of it.

295
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:40,640
I think it makes good sense.
I,

296
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,730
you know,
I'm like you,

297
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:42,690
I don't,
you know,

298
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,630
I've,
I've spent most of my life overseas,

299
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,553
some of them in some pretty crappy 
countries where socialism has been 

300
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,124
tried.
And I understand he's a democratic 

301
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:53,160
socialist and so it's a kinder,
gentler form.

302
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,010
Uh,
but I've

303
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,520
seen some pretty harsh results from 
those systems overseas.

304
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,650
And I,
uh,

305
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:04,060
I'm surprised that,
I'm surprised that there,

306
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,730
I understand young people jumping on 
that train.

307
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,550
Um,
and I'm just surprised that the,

308
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:11,860
uh,
the other folks who are on board,

309
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,813
you know,
there's a lot of people up in Wall 

310
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:14,240
Street that are saying,
hey,

311
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:15,074
Bernie,
Bernie is going to tax the shit out of 

312
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:17,780
those people.
Uh,

313
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,940
and he said,
he said as much so I don't know how much

314
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,430
he's going to tax people.
I've tried to pay attention to how the,

315
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:25,264
I mean,
essentially what he wants to do is 

316
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:29,020
anyone who makes more than a certain 
amount,

317
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,770
he wants to impose a very large tax 
above that certain amount.

318
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,873
You know,
Phil figured out whatever that number 

319
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:35,950
is,
whether it's $10 million a year,

320
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:38,080
whatever the hell it is,
anything over that,

321
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,600
he's just going to attack the fuck out 
of it.

322
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,760
But the problem is that's not going to 
pay for everything he needs.

323
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,280
He needs to,
he that tax is going to roll down to the

324
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:46,114
middle class and the lower middle class.
And that's sort of the elephant in the 

325
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,534
room that nobody wants to talk about.
I mean Hilary's ben talking about it a 

326
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,770
little bit.
She's been bringing this up but,

327
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,823
and I,
the Republicans have been talking about 

328
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:57,424
it cause I don't think they view him as,
as anybody that they're going to be 

329
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:01,270
facing in the general election.
But you know,

330
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:02,104
taxing,
taxing that 1% the 2% to 3% whatever it 

331
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:05,584
is,
you know,

332
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,723
you could raise those taxes up to 99% 
you're not going to pay for free 

333
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,690
healthcare and education for this,
this country.

334
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,420
It's not only that,
everybody's always complaining about the

335
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:14,950
government.
There's too much government.

336
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:16,690
The government's intruding in our lives.

337
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,523
The government,
this government is that when you charge 

338
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:21,610
more taxes,
you take more taxes.

339
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:23,470
What are you doing?
You creating more government.

340
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,723
That's just what you're doing now.
The money's not going to go or directly 

341
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:28,324
to people.
You're not going to get a check in the 

342
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:30,064
mail folks.
It's going to go to the government and 

343
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:35,650
then the same incompetent fucks that are
handling the irs and all the other shit.

344
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,960
Those are the people that are going to 
be handling this money.

345
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,450
What do you think they're going to do?
They're going to create more jobs.

346
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,340
They're going to have more people 
working for less.

347
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,510
They're gonna make more money and work,
get less shit done,

348
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:48,610
and it's going to be more catastrophe.
And it's,

349
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,460
it's a cluster fuck.
There's too many goddamn people is too.

350
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,080
And you know what,
when 2008 hit,

351
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:53,914
when the,
when the economy really went in the 

352
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:55,660
Shitter,
you know,

353
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:57,820
growth in terms of employment,
you know,

354
00:13:57,821 --> 00:13:58,490
where it happened.

355
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,323
Uh,
most of this country was in Washington 

356
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:00,814
DC.
I mean,

357
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,973
you saw the growth of government as,
as the economy was absolutely heading 

358
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:07,510
south.
And that's just,

359
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:09,070
that's the way it works.
There's certain,

360
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,030
there's certain things about,
uh,

361
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,093
big government that hold true,
whether it's here or outside this 

362
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:15,700
country.
But anyway,

363
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:16,361
so I,
you know,

364
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:17,740
I look at Bernie and I think I hate,
yeah,

365
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,980
I get it.
I liked,

366
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,070
I liked the fact that he's been 
consistent.

367
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,170
I think it makes sense.
But then you look at the Republican side

368
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,240
and then we go back to that picture of 
trump and you think,

369
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:26,950
how does that,
how does that fucking happened?

370
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:30,370
How do you get to this point?
And you think about poor,

371
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,720
what's his name?
Scott Kelly.

372
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,290
The astronauts coming down after a long 
sleep up in the space station.

373
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,810
I hope to hell that they haven't told 
them shit about what's happening.

374
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,763
Cause how funny would it be for him to 
land and trump is the leading candidate 

375
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:45,160
and nobody said anything to him yet.
And he just comes home,

376
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:46,690
turns on the TV.
It's Super Tuesday,

377
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:48,910
trump's one everywhere.
And he's going to be,

378
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,773
I mean,
he's dealing with gravitation and all 

379
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,040
that stuff.
I guess this isn't

380
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,380
his biggest deal.
Don't take kid like Internet up there.

381
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,300
I think he's got something.
I'm sure they do.

382
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,140
He's got satellite pregnancy and 
delivery.

383
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,580
I mean,
he's got to know,

384
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:01,971
I mean,
you,

385
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:05,480
you'd go crazy if you're completely 
removed from life when you're up there.

386
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

387
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,080
I think,
uh,

388
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,090
I,
I'm,

389
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,263
I,
I would love to think that he doesn't 

390
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:13,720
know and he'd be the one person who'd 
you get gobsmacked when he shows up here

391
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:14,710
and finds out what's going on.

392
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,340
You could run last minute.
Yeah,

393
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:16,821
look,
look,

394
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:17,390
look,
look,

395
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,223
stop,
stop.

396
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,011
Well,
here's the thing.

397
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:19,740
It's,
it's,

398
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,573
there's no one else.
If Hillary gets tossed up in this email 

399
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:24,944
exchange thing,
if she gets in trouble for this and you 

400
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,161
know,
it's,

401
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,140
it's Bernie.
That's it on the,

402
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:32,720
on the democratic side and on the 
Republican side,

403
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:36,650
it's essentially down to mean cruise.
Seems like he's fallen out of it.

404
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,150
It's Marco Rubio and Donald Trump and 
rubio is a distant second and people are

405
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:43,760
so excited about trump because he talks 
shit.

406
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,800
He's,
he's bold and brash.

407
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:47,930
He insults people and he's got his own 
money.

408
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,363
He says a bunch of crazy shit.
Like this is a great picture of him 

409
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,800
where it's,
it's a photo shopped picture of a,

410
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:55,634
somebody made a picture of him and he's 
got a gun and he's pointing it out of 

411
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:01,640
the window of a car and it says,
get in Pussy.

412
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,693
We're going to make America great again,
but it just seems like there's so many 

413
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:08,834
like goofy white guys who are ready.
They're ready and psyched to have trump 

414
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:17,990
as president.
Like some insulting reality star,

415
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:19,040
kind of a president

416
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,700
who wants to impose trade sanctions.
Yeah.

417
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:25,540
That's what you want to do when when the
economy is troubled and weak,

418
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,500
that's a great idea is to,
is to shut down international trade.

419
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,170
That's,
that's always proven to be right.

420
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,950
Smart thing to do.
There's the picture.

421
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:38,010
Look at this picture.
Oh God,

422
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:39,440
look.
That was my screen saver.

423
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,490
See as a comic,
I should be excited about this.

424
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:43,360
Yeah,
you should be.

425
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:44,194
I should be like,
I am going to have a great four years 

426
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,160
when you have to do anything.
You wouldn't have to,

427
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,053
there'll be no work involved in that.
They would just go on the Internet and 

428
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,000
it would be a rush to get to the stage 
quickest with the material.

429
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,013
That's,
that would be the problem because 

430
00:16:56,561 --> 00:17:00,400
everybody's going to have the same jokes
is the folly will be outrageous.

431
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,280
I think people are excited though that 
he's got his own money.

432
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,730
He's not entrenched in the system,
the Washington system.

433
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,440
But God dammit,

434
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,690
no it can't.
We can't,

435
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:15,350
uh,
we can't have this happen.

436
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,643
We have,
we have more crisis around the world 

437
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:19,960
right now.
More hotspots,

438
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,170
more potential,
very,

439
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:25,950
very serious conflicts going on.
And now is the time you would think,

440
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,190
whether it comes from the left or the 
right that you want really clear minded,

441
00:17:29,191 --> 00:17:31,020
strategic,
smart,

442
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:33,720
pragmatic,
reasoned leadership.

443
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,000
An essay that,
I mean,

444
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,883
you know,
trump isn't,

445
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,340
isn't the guy,
um,

446
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,120
a hey great that he's insulting people.
Great that he's talking outside,

447
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,730
but he doesn't,
you know,

448
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,420
and I'm sure this is going to piss off 
the,

449
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,050
I don't know how many trump supporters 
you've got listening.

450
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,810
Uh,
he doesn't stand for anything,

451
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,621
right?
I mean,

452
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:55,620
he stands for what?
I mean,

453
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,510
I suppose the sport has,
would say stands for winning.

454
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,370
Uh,
but what the hell does that mean?

455
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,630
Tiger blood.
Tiger blood.

456
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,100
That's it.
I had a tiger.

457
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,490
It's got Canis Panther bits.
Maybe Charlie.

458
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,050
She could be his running mate.
We'll fucking,

459
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,550
he'd win for sure.
Thank God.

460
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:09,384
But I mean,
but the fact that we've been having a 

461
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,640
conversation about it,
what we're talking about,

462
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:13,650
whether a guy like trump is,
is,

463
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,410
is suited to be president is astounding,
right?

464
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:17,490
We,
we get that far in the weeds.

465
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:18,950
We shouldn't even have that 
conversation.

466
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:20,370
You should be up at the 30,000
foot level.

467
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:21,690
Says,
now let's push that to decide.

468
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,441
Well,
you know,

469
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:26,130
who oddly is impressive to me is Ben 
Carson.

470
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,863
I know he believes a lot of wacky stuff.
Like he's not entirely convinced that 

471
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,360
evolution is real.
He's got,

472
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,820
he's quite wrapped his head around that 
one.

473
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:40,050
Yet he's got some wacky ideas.
Like he's got a great picture of himself

474
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,153
that he's painting,
that he had done at his home where it's 

475
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:48,450
him and Jesus is behind him and Jesus 
has his hands on his shoulders.

476
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,340
It's,
yeah.

477
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,410
Okay.
Um,

478
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,950
and that is this.
Oh,

479
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,823
hey.
We found it.

480
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,390
First of all,
if I was Jesus,

481
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:01,290
I'd fucking smack him.
Why is my head so small?

482
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,780
Why are my hands so big?
Why am I wearing a bathrobe?

483
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:07,680
What the fuck you and I can extenuate 
that weird evil widow's peak thing going

484
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:08,514
on.
It took a crease in his head like a pit 

485
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:10,750
bull.
Look.

486
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,603
He looks,
he's ready to bite your face off the 

487
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:15,000
clean line had.
You're right Jamie and he's wearing it.

488
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:18,690
Comfy hotel bathroom.
That's what that looks like.

489
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:19,750
It doesn't look like,
uh,

490
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,850
you know,
garb from,

491
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:22,700
from the Middle East.
Necessary at all.

492
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,480
Looks like he's just walked out of the 
[inaudible].

493
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,180
I talked to your hair.
I don't even think they have bleach back

494
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:28,860
then.
Did they have bleach in the Jesus days?

495
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:30,530
I mean things were like natural cotton 
call it.

496
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,190
I'm pretty sure they had no tide 
capsules or even though I don't like how

497
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:36,960
he made Jesus smaller than him either.

498
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,310
That's kind of weird.
Yeah,

499
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,810
that's rude.
You know,

500
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,820
who knows who painted it for him,
but I agree with that.

501
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,540
I liked the fact that I get and get to 
talk about someone who's reasoned.

502
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,110
I like the fact that he's reason,
but he's not,

503
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,053
we got to a point,
he's not presidential and we've gotten 

504
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:54,120
to that point where there's so many 
problems with our system.

505
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:57,040
But one of the problems is I think that 
people are,

506
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,650
are hell bent on finding the candidate 
that they agree with everything on it,

507
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,583
agrees with them on everything.
And I've got my three little boys are 

508
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,181
what,
eight,

509
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:07,014
six and four.
And they know they're not going to get 

510
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:09,610
everything they want,
right?

511
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,960
But they also know that if they,
if they work at enough,

512
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,940
they'll get some of what they want,
right.

513
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:17,280
And then they're going to be happy 
enough and they'll go off and you know,

514
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,240
the day continues,
adjust their expectations,

515
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,210
their expectations.

516
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,030
But nobody wants to do that anymore.
Been in politics.

517
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,993
And so you're,
you're getting everybody's splintering 

518
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:27,630
off.
And so,

519
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,680
you know,
the worry obviously,

520
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:31,110
and it's not an epiphany,
but people talking about all the time on

521
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:32,190
the republican side,
it's just,

522
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,024
you know,
people throw these verbal hand grenades 

523
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:38,280
out and there's no way to repair the 
damage once there is some nominee,

524
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,860
if there is a nominee.
And he's trying to do that.

525
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:43,380
Now,
Chris Christie's now friends with Donald

526
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,550
Trump,
he's endorsing Donald Trump,

527
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,473
jeff sessions and Donald Trump.
Newt Gingrich is reportedly talking to 

528
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:49,240
Donald Trump.
How,

529
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,740
how much,
and I don't,

530
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,690
this sounds wrong,
but how,

531
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,260
how do you get to the point where you 
can set aside,

532
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,423
um,
all your concerns and agree to step 

533
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,290
forward and say that he's the guy?
Um,

534
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,850
I don't,
I don't know how that works,

535
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,090
but yeah,
there's,

536
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,510
there's not one person that,
and that's fine.

537
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,343
So what you have to do is you have to 
look for the combination of character 

538
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,460
and experience.
I think that's what we used to do.

539
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,920
And,
but it's all bread and circus now.

540
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:19,900
So it doesn't,
that shit doesn't matter anymore.

541
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:20,734
I don't know.
I think we're going towards the third 

542
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,630
party at some point.
We can't,

543
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:27,631
you can't have a president that is,
has any secrets.

544
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,253
They can't have any,
any sort of a weird kink or weird 

545
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:34,384
background.
Like could you imagine if JFK was alive 

546
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:37,744
today?
What kind of shit they would dig up on 

547
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:42,660
that guy's alive.
Oh cause he was at free.

548
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,350
Great.
Great President.

549
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,540
But he was a freak.
The guy was a sexual freak and,

550
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,413
and the press corps kept that segment.
They do it just like what they did with 

551
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:53,530
the Roosevelt and being in the 
wheelchair tacit agreement.

552
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:54,520
We're not going to bring this up.

553
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,713
I mean that was how they did it back 
then because they felt like they had a 

554
00:21:57,431 --> 00:22:00,760
duty to keep America strong and they 
just,

555
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:04,030
everybody just kept it to themselves and
kept their mouth shut.

556
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,313
Yeah.
Well I mean taft taft was crazy and you 

557
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:09,340
know,
with the Preston and bring up any of his

558
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,833
shit.
How about when Lyndon Johnson literally 

559
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,110
was doing a press conference while he's 
taking a shit?

560
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,150
That's right.
That's a true story.

561
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:18,010
Yeah.
Press conference on the toilet,

562
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:20,440
taking a shit in front of a bunch of 
reporters.

563
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,890
He would talk to his cabinet guys or 
guys would come in and,

564
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:24,430
and he would be dictating notes and he'd
be,

565
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,480
you know,
squatting on the,

566
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:27,430
on the pot there and you've got to 
admire,

567
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,080
they,
the guy was comfortable in his own skin.

568
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,070
But,
uh,

569
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,510
I think that,
you know,

570
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:33,160
everything's gotten sliced and diced.

571
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,043
Um,
and which is by itself also very 

572
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,470
divisive.
So the more that you do that,

573
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:39,460
the more you take,
you know,

574
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:40,390
the country and say,
well,

575
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:41,224
we're going to,
we're going to slice this up in the 

576
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:42,604
various demographics and sectors and 
groups and opinions and we're going to 

577
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:45,954
go after this one.
Well by definition you're going to end 

578
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:51,030
up pitting groups against each other.
And that's what we've been seeing.

579
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:56,060
And I think that's in part why we're,
why we're so fuck now.

580
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:56,911
You know,
and,

581
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:58,990
and it's not,
it's not a new phenomena.

582
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:00,940
I'm not going to throw all that on the 
current administration.

583
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:01,511
You know,
they've been,

584
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:03,820
I think they've been more divisive than 
they have been unifying.

585
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,060
But you know,
overall as a country.

586
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:07,894
And part of it may be the speed of 
information and all the rest of this 

587
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,050
shit,
but it just seems like,

588
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,860
you know,
we're,

589
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,743
we're getting to the point where I think
we're going to have to get rid of the 

590
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:16,780
two parties,
says,

591
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,040
Hey,
we'll keep the two party system,

592
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,780
but we're gonna have to have a third,
maybe a fourth.

593
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,703
There's got to be more potential 
opportunities for people because that's 

594
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:24,960
what they're demanding.
Yeah,

595
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:25,803
I agree.
Yeah.

596
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,191
Anyone else?
I think,

597
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:28,810
I think there shouldn't be a president 
anymore.

598
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,090
I think it's a ridiculous ideas to 
cabinet.

599
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,960
Just a committee.
Just having one guy that's in show me,

600
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:38,980
we know he's not really in charge.
We know there's just too much shit going

601
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:40,270
on.
There's no way he could be.

602
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,120
There's not mean when something happens,
if something goes wrong,

603
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,920
like someone,
someone said to me something,

604
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,010
a drones,

605
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,380
they were talking about drones and Obama
has blood on his hands.

606
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:49,214
Mike,
do you really think he's in charge of 

607
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,010
all that?
Do you really think there's any way this

608
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:56,300
guy could be on top of the economy,
can be on top of international trade?

609
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,280
It could be on top of international 
relations.

610
00:23:58,281 --> 00:23:59,960
And he's also piloting drones.

611
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,240
There's a lawyer in the White House 
basically,

612
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,074
by the way,
who makes that call on high value 

613
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,430
targets and whether we get to go or not 
go a lawyer,

614
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,580
a lawyer does.
Yeah.

615
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,553
Yeah.
Go figure.

616
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,560
How does it know with no real national 
security experience?

617
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:13,840
Who's The guy?
Don't even say his name.

618
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,840
I won't say,
I won't say the name,

619
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,513
but,
so this guy decides whether or not it's 

620
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:23,340
worth the potential casualties.
Yeah,

621
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,233
there's a,
there's a shitload of work that goes on 

622
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,313
in,
uh,

623
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,210
in getting to that point where you can 
say,

624
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,430
we've got the target package.
We,

625
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,930
uh,
can we go or not go?

626
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,150
And people,
you know,

627
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,710
and again,
I understand,

628
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:37,940
you know,
when people think that the,

629
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,260
you know,
the agencies out there,

630
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,100
you know,
look at the,

631
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,050
create a one world government,
a screw everybody over.

632
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,550
But,
um,

633
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,840
how the fuck could that ever happen?
I had all that shit

634
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,733
drives me fucking crazy.
The FBI and CIA can't even get along 

635
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:51,970
long

636
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,631
and you can't,
well I mean,

637
00:24:52,631 --> 00:24:54,750
and sometimes you don't get it right.
Right,

638
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,670
exactly.
I mean there are so many,

639
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:58,710
and maybe cause we talk about checks and
balances,

640
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:00,230
we talk about the Intel committees and 
you know,

641
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,313
the sort of that nature,
but maybe what maybe what really keeps 

642
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:06,050
us safe from the one world government 
has affected,

643
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,890
you know,
there's so much territorial pissing that

644
00:25:07,891 --> 00:25:11,280
goes on between the different agencies.
But the point being is that once you get

645
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:12,780
that target package and you,
and you,

646
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,623
you,
you've got to go get approval and the 

647
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:17,190
approval is not housed in the,
in the agency.

648
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:18,024
It's not housed at the Pentagon final 
decision makings over at the White 

649
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,281
House.
And it's,

650
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:23,080
it's,
it's,

651
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,150
it's basically a legal perspective.
And so once that's done,

652
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,080
then yeah,
sure you can,

653
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:30,050
you can fire a rocket up their ass if,
you know,

654
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,000
if they're still where they are and you 
can get the decision made quick enough.

655
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,770
But it's,
uh,

656
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:35,671
yeah,
I,

657
00:25:35,671 --> 00:25:36,540
but I agree with it.
So your,

658
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:37,740
your,
your point is correct.

659
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:38,574
You know,
the president,

660
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,100
you know,
it's like a CEO of a company,

661
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,260
you know,
he didn't know what the hell is going on

662
00:25:43,261 --> 00:25:47,700
past his division leaders or no,
he could,

663
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,133
there's no way he could possibly know 
all the things that are going on that 

664
00:25:52,891 --> 00:25:55,230
the United States is involved with all 
over the world.

665
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,730
There's no way.
I mean,

666
00:25:56,731 --> 00:25:57,564
what do we have?
How many different paces don't we have 

667
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:01,360
like bases in more than a hundred 
countries?

668
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,730
Yeah,
yeah.

669
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:04,600
I mean if you just define a base as the 
u s you know,

670
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,700
permanent or semipermanent presence.
Yeah.

671
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:07,090
It's,
it's a,

672
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,050
it's a lot.
But there's no,

673
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:10,080
and then,
and not just that,

674
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:12,120
but I mean every,
every other operation that goes on,

675
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:13,730
every other activity that goes on,
every,

676
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,190
there's,
you know,

677
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,093
that's why,
but I will say that's why you want at 

678
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,030
the top while we still have a president.

679
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,420
That's why you want someone who's very 
reasoned and,

680
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,880
uh,
clear-eyed,

681
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,570
uh,
not thin skinned.

682
00:26:27,571 --> 00:26:28,404
She wants someone who can negotiate.
You want someone who doesn't think 

683
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:30,864
they're the smartest person in the room 
and then they need to be able to pull 

684
00:26:34,951 --> 00:26:38,760
together the cabinet that is going to 
actually start making decisions.

685
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,030
And I think presidential candidates even
at this stage,

686
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,310
should be required to WHO's going to be 
in their cabinet.

687
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,230
Who would be your choice for,
for these various,

688
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,450
but yeah,
I think,

689
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,210
you know,
that doesn't really get brought up,

690
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:52,044
right?
No.

691
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,621
Oh No,
no.

692
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:53,151
I and I,
I,

693
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:55,380
you know,
I think it would make a big difference.

694
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:59,430
You want to know who their team is going
to be and you know,

695
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,563
who knows?
Maybe that would cause a scramble for 

696
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,453
top people and then you'd,
I don't know what that was all that 

697
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,210
would mean,
but it,

698
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,430
it's a,
let's just say it's a very disappointing

699
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:09,264
political season.

700
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,400
My big fear is that we're going to have 
artificial intelligence and then one day

701
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:15,234
artificial intelligence is going to 
govern world policy and world world 

702
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:20,040
issues.
I really believe that.

703
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,443
I know I'm a Carter for thinking this,
but I think that there's a co was going 

704
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:28,140
to come a point in time where we 
establish rules of operation,

705
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,283
you know,
do no harm or do the least harm 

706
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:31,830
possible.
You know,

707
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:35,010
these are the laws,
these are the parameters that we need to

708
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:35,910
uh,
operate in.

709
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:37,590
These are the rules that we need to 
enforce.

710
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,980
And this is when something gets like,
like something like Isis,

711
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,620
when it gets to a point where everyone 
agrees,

712
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,310
okay,
we have a,

713
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,700
we have a tremendous issue.
We've got to do something militarily,

714
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,520
strategically.
Some,

715
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:51,930
some choices have to be made.
What do we do?

716
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,930
And that you could punch this in somehow
or another to something,

717
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,960
some sort of artificial intelligence and
it will dish out some sort of a decision

718
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,690
based upon the rules of engagement based
upon the,

719
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,500
the agreed upon parameters that we have 
set.

720
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,191
Yeah,
I mean,

721
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:09,760
yeah,
we're kind of marching it,

722
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,550
I know what the world would get to that 
point.

723
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:12,384
But you know,
we certainly work games scenarios out 

724
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,423
where you're,
you're running a large number of 

725
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,000
potential possibilities,
um,

726
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,530
through the system.
And it,

727
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,560
and it is literally like you said,
it's spitting out,

728
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,330
you know,
likely outcomes.

729
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,523
And you're weighing that against me 
because one big part that it's always 

730
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:29,400
missed because you know,
again,

731
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:30,900
there's this tendency to think that,
you know what,

732
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,540
people are just out there doing shit for
the hell of it,

733
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,673
but there's a,
there's a big risk versus gain 

734
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:36,654
calculation that goes on,
whether it's at the agency or the 

735
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:41,850
military anywhere else.
And so you're constantly evaluating this

736
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:45,030
and part of that eventually becomes 
political risk,

737
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:46,500
political blow back.
Um,

738
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,260
so yeah,
that's like the Benghazi thing.

739
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,460
How did I end up on that?

740
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,160
Um,
but you look at Benghazi and you think,

741
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,950
um,
here's the part I don't understand about

742
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:56,850
that.
And not that you asked,

743
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:57,684
but all they had to do during the course
of that attack and they had no idea how 

744
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:03,354
long that attack was going to go on for.
All they had to do was put the birds up 

745
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,200
with the guys in them and head towards 
Bengazi.

746
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,260
That's all they had to do.
And then this would not have ever been a

747
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:15,210
story.
They probably wouldn't have gotten there

748
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,310
in time to save lives,
but they would've gotten there.

749
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:19,320
They would have been there,
they would have secured the facility,

750
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:22,180
they would have helped with the dust to 
clean up and they it,

751
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,183
and it wouldn't have been an issue.
But the idea that they could all be 

752
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:29,490
sitting around in the war room watching 
this and not have that,

753
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,770
you know,
pop in their heads because three to four

754
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,540
weeks down the road was a national 
election.

755
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,070
And all I could imagine was who's going 
to be some goat rope.

756
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,463
And they couldn't get the,
to the point where they thought there'd 

757
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:41,710
be zero risk,
but it doesn't any sense.

758
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:42,544
All those guys on the ground wanted was 
to know that the calvary had been 

759
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:46,390
called,
they didn't expect to be saved,

760
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:48,850
but they thought that help would be on 
its way because that's what you do.

761
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:49,991
And,
and it's a,

762
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:52,570
it's one of those strange.
So when you talk about,

763
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:53,404
you know,
scenarios in war gaming and potential 

764
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:56,794
political blow back and all that,
it's a fascinating world where you sit 

765
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:01,120
in a war room and all these different 
sides are being debated.

766
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,973
My perspective on my gaseous,
I just don't understand why they didn't 

767
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:07,960
just try.
That's all they had to do.

768
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,330
And so we would have been a stories 
because of the election.

769
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:11,843
I think there were,
I think there were more political 

770
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,240
operatives in that room then a then 
tactical operators.

771
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,200
And I think that somebody got jammed up,
um,

772
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,080
who wanted to spin them up and send 
them.

773
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,940
And I think that it was probably 
because,

774
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:26,774
and again,
I understand it's speculation and I get 

775
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:29,494
it,
and I'm not one of those people that 

776
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:32,140
said they could have saved those lives.
That wouldn't happen.

777
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,393
But I just don't understand the simple 
concept that one of those political 

778
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:37,360
operatives who said,
you know what,

779
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:39,220
if we don't try,
yeah,

780
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:40,210
we might get fucked on this.

781
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,410
Well,
shouldn't there also be a scenario or at

782
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:45,244
least a,
just a rule in place that whenever 

783
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:48,430
there's an attack you send in the 
troops,

784
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,383
that's,
that's the component that you're 

785
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:51,514
supposed to be keeping.
That's a promise is supposed to be 

786
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:53,884
there.
And that's why I promise that's a great 

787
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:55,940
way of putting it.
And that's why all those,

788
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,010
all the guys have been,
you know,

789
00:30:57,011 --> 00:30:59,100
in the folks that were in that program

790
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,900
and,
and everybody I know was,

791
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:04,680
is people say why,
why would you be fixated on this?

792
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,341
Why,
why,

793
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:06,330
you know,
why is this important?

794
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,051
It doesn't mean,
you know,

795
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:08,220
like Hillary Clinton said,
what Ma,

796
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,030
what difference does it,
yeah,

797
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,873
exactly.
And for that reason that you said there 

798
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:13,914
is,
there is this understanding that you 

799
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:17,634
will make the effort,
you'll try and nobody out there on that 

800
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,940
pointy edge of the spear expects that 
there'll be saved.

801
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,160
But they do expect that someone's going 
to call the calvary

802
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,040
and throw the idea that you're left 
hanging to be hung out to dry with an a.

803
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,280
It's not like there's no resources.
That's where it doesn't make any sense.

804
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,240
You know,
we have no sources.

805
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:37,790
Yeah.
That's why it's so disturbing to people.

806
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,710
It's like if this was a political 
decision,

807
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,980
it's like to try to minimize blow back 
because of the election coming up.

808
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,920
So let's just not do anything.
If that was the decision,

809
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,933
well that that's contrary to the whole 
purpose of having military in the first 

810
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:50,174
place.
Like if there's a fucking attack he 

811
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:52,274
supposed to send in the troops,
particularly attack on your facilities 

812
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,843
and particularly to make sure that that 
fucking never happens again because you 

813
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,613
know that every time there's an election
coming up and well they're not going to 

814
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:04,364
do shit because there's an election 
coming up in two weeks now we can go in 

815
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:07,910
and it's time to do it.
Yeah.

816
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,590
That's a crazy precedent to set.
Yeah.

817
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,290
Well it,
it,

818
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:10,920
it,
it is.

819
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,860
And again,
I wasn't there.

820
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:13,880
I don't know.
I just,

821
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:14,714
in looking at it all the various 
scenarios and knowing what resources 

822
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:20,300
were available and knowing what the guys
expected on the ground,

823
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:21,134
I just don't,
I don't,

824
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,640
I don't get it.
And you know,

825
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,474
for a group,
meaning the administration that's 

826
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:27,920
supposed to be so clever and politically
savvy,

827
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,143
it just didn't make any sense.
And now they've been having to suffer 

828
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:32,990
with it ever since.
And aside from the fact that they did,

829
00:32:32,991 --> 00:32:35,570
judges didn't fucking make the effort to
try to save these people.

830
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,740
And again,
not that they would have,

831
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,140
but how do you not,
how do you not try?

832
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,340
I don't,
I don't understand that.

833
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,680
I don't understand any of it.
I don't understand.

834
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:43,514
Whenever they're making decisions based 
on whether or not there's an election 

835
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:50,210
coming up and you would do something 
differently if there was and in people's

836
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:55,211
lives could be lost because an elections
coming up versus how you would behave.

837
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,130
It was first term or first year,
first term.

838
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,630
I think it's all madness.

839
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,330
Well,
there's a risk aversion,

840
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,060
um,
that that takes hold.

841
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,880
And we got to a point,
and it's not just a recent thing,

842
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:07,410
it's not just this administration,
you know,

843
00:33:07,411 --> 00:33:09,320
to be fair,
but there's this,

844
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,163
this understanding or this belief 
somehow that we can get to a zero risk 

845
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,020
on a military operation or an 
intelligence operation.

846
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:16,854
And you know,
so show me that we won't have 

847
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:19,831
casualties.
Well,

848
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,270
what the,
what the fuck does that mean?

849
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,163
You're at a risk taking business.
You want to try to minimize that risk 

850
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:26,040
for sure.
But when,

851
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:26,874
when,
when your decision making gets to that 

852
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,214
point and you start,
then it starts feeding down through the 

853
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:36,420
ranks and you start getting mid level 
managers rising up who believed that,

854
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,050
you know,
uh,

855
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,180
a good watch is when nothing happens on 
their watch.

856
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,690
You've got a real problem because it's 
unrealistic.

857
00:33:42,691 --> 00:33:43,524
Yeah.
I mean you don't,

858
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,330
again,
you don't,

859
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,470
you don't want to rush you out there.
You know,

860
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:47,291
until you,
you,

861
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,510
you,
you want to have a game plan,

862
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,373
right?
You want to know what you're doing 

863
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:51,780
operationally.
But you know,

864
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,713
there,
there are certain things that are worth 

865
00:33:53,461 --> 00:33:56,340
bend and you spear over now for a guy 
like you

866
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,223
that was in the CIA for so long,
it's been involved in this stuff for so 

867
00:34:00,091 --> 00:34:02,760
long.
How exhausting is all of this because it

868
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:05,970
seems to me that like,
it seems like it never ends.

869
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,180
It seems like you

870
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,393
like

871
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,430
is step back for a little while and it 
just piles up more.

872
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,220
It did.
Indeed.

873
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,870
If you retire,
the new guy comes in and you look at the

874
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:17,704
new guy doing it and like the same 
shit's happening and it doesn't seem 

875
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:20,554
like anybody put a dent in anything and 
it continues to go on like the Middle 

876
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,230
East at one point.
What point in time?

877
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,000
I mean how I know what you're getting at
there.

878
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:30,850
That seems pretty buttoned up.
I think we've got that under control.

879
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,230
It's the craziest fucking place in the 
world.

880
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,170
It's the if the whole world,
okay,

881
00:34:38,171 --> 00:34:40,510
let's put it this way.
If the whole world was serious,

882
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,183
right?
Yeah.

883
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,380
It was just one big one.
Big series.

884
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:46,250
Syria.
What,

885
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,910
what the fuck if the whole world he was 
Olivia.

886
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

887
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,950
Imagine the whole world was Libya.
What?

888
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,990
Nah.
You know what?

889
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:55,700
I,
um,

890
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,600
if you had told us,
we spent a lot of time trying to get the

891
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:03,020
Soviets out of Afghanistan during the 
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the

892
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:03,854
Soviet strike.
I spend a lot of time trying to get 

893
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:06,980
themselves out of there.
About four years into their occupation,

894
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:09,290
their,
and they realize,

895
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,610
and we know this because we've seen the,
you know,

896
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:12,320
the Kremlin papers and we've had,
you know,

897
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,900
access to a lot of their,
their thinking at that time.

898
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,640
Uh,
they,

899
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:18,110
after about year four,
they said,

900
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:20,000
this is fucked up.
We gotta get Outta here.

901
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:20,834
But what could they do?
So they spent the next five years or so 

902
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,330
try a variety of things.
They tried to,

903
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,164
first of all,
they tried to find a government are 

904
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:28,634
individuals that they could,
they could leave and place that we 

905
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:31,760
continue to push their agenda.

906
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,860
They couldn't find anybody.
They were dealing with corruption.

907
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:34,940
We know that they couldn't,
you know,

908
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,860
they couldn't get past a lot of the 
corruption.

909
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:37,694
That sounds familiar.
They retreated from the countryside and 

910
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:40,801
decided,
well,

911
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:43,020
we'll just hold the urban centers.
So that's exactly what we did.

912
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,140
So they went through the same problems 
that we did.

913
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:51,141
If you would said anything when we were 
out there handing a weapons systems,

914
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,374
the Musha Dean,
and in retrospect maybe that wasn't a 

915
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:55,740
good idea.
Um,

916
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,220
but if you had told us that we'd be back
two and a half decades later,

917
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,290
doing the same thing that the Soviets 
were doing,

918
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,213
you know,
trying to,

919
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,780
I don't know what,
what we're trying to do,

920
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,870
build a nation,
you know,

921
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,753
uh,
sell democracy where they don't have a 

922
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,460
fucking clue what we were selling.
Um,

923
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,250
so we don't,
part of it is what,

924
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:15,180
what you were saying.

925
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,233
We don't learn from our mistakes.
So that's why that's the probably the 

926
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:19,374
most tiring part is watching shit happen
over and over and cycles and every 

927
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,600
generation thinks they can do it better.
And so that's,

928
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:28,320
and that's a good thing probably,
but there's a lot of Hubris involved,

929
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,183
right?
And thinking that you're going to do 

930
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:31,650
this somehow,
it's going to be different this time.

931
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,310
I had a guy debating this guy who,
uh,

932
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,900
uh,
will remain anonymous.

933
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:39,360
She was in the military and,
um,

934
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,810
we were in,
we were in Afghanistan,

935
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,823
um,
at that point already with trying to 

936
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,513
nation build.
And I was very pessimistic about the 

937
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:51,540
whole thing.
And I kept saying this a fucking,

938
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,770
you know,
uh,

939
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,663
this is not what we should be doing with
our boys are women as well and the 

940
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,680
resources and everything else.
I said,

941
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:00,420
they don't understand what the fuck 
we're after here.

942
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,380
And we did a great tactical mission,
you know,

943
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,140
right after nine 11 we did a beautiful,
I sound like trump.

944
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,490
Beautiful.
That's the mission.

945
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,610
And that's what we're good at.
What great attack,

946
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:11,760
tactical missions.
But then you know,

947
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:12,594
about springtime in 2002,
we should have gotten the fuck out so 

948
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:15,690
that if you do it again,
we're going to come back.

949
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,983
And we didn't,
we stayed because we wanted to build a 

950
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:22,410
road or improve their literacy rate by a
couple of points.

951
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,700
So this guy said,
well,

952
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,050
it's different this time,
because I was saying,

953
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:26,100
look,
it didn't work for the Russians.

954
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,630
Why do you think it's gonna work for us?
And he said,

955
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:28,650
well,
they hated the Russians.

956
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,510
And I thought,
wow,

957
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:32,550
that's,
that's your reasoning is because somehow

958
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:34,710
they like us,
they or they,

959
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,460
they're gonna,
you know,

960
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,680
we're going to fill chocolate bars out 
to him and they,

961
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:38,514
you know,
they're going to end and stockings and 

962
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:40,260
they're going to come running.

963
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,850
I mean,
what the Hell is that point?

964
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:44,910
But we have this,
this mentality that we're going to do it

965
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:48,360
better this time.
So you look at,

966
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,430
you look at,
uh,

967
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,520
you look at Isis for example,
and I mean,

968
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,010
who couldn't have guessed if we 
completely walk out,

969
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,750
you can debate all sorts of things about
Iraq,

970
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:00,510
but who couldn't have seen,
if you'll walk out of that place,

971
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,840
it was going to devolve into chaos.
If you leave a vacuum,

972
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,840
it's not good.
And so that's what we've got.

973
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:09,000
But we keep doing the same things over 
and over again.

974
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,280
And you could argue what we've doing in 
Iraq.

975
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:15,090
We did all those years ago after the 
Soviets left Afghanistan.

976
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,350
And so we left and it evolved into what 
it devolves into.

977
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,410
And oddly enough,
there were a lot of neo cons who thought

978
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,540
that was terrible.
We felt guilty about that.

979
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,040
So now we're going to get it right this 
time.

980
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,920
We're going to stay not thinking about 
what happened to the Soviets.

981
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,060
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

982
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,313
I remember when Mccain was debating 
Obama when they were running for 

983
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:36,040
president and Obama was

984
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,360
talking about going into Afghanistan.
And uh,

985
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,650
I remember this is a very sobering 
moment where Mccain said,

986
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,543
what,
what are you talking about going to 

987
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:46,180
Afghanistan?
You just going to send troops in.

988
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:49,420
Do you understand that place?
And it was clear that Obama didn't,

989
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:50,254
you could tell by his body language.
You could tell by the way he was 

990
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,370
speaking about it,
mccain had this really clear sentence.

991
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,593
He said,
that plays hasn't changed since 

992
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,990
Alexander the Great was running it.
And when,

993
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:04,540
when he said that,
I remember thinking like,

994
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,160
Whoa,
what the fuck?

995
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,200
So then I started researching 
Afghanistan,

996
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,250
then I started researching the terrain 
and how crazy it is.

997
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:15,820
It's like literally like trying to 
control like the rocky mountains,

998
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,300
like the back country out of hell.
It's so remote.

999
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,173
It's so impossible to get to.
And then you find out that there's 

1000
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:26,380
really only one city.
There's Kabul in the entire country.

1001
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:27,460
This basically,
you know,

1002
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,830
it was a few little towns.
There's one city.

1003
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,480
Yeah.
And it's just warm.

1004
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,080
Don't know what they don't know what 
we've been trying to sell them.

1005
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,670
And it's the same with,
with Iraq.

1006
00:39:35,671 --> 00:39:38,850
It's the same with Libya.
Libya's a complete hot mess.

1007
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:39,250
Now,

1008
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,520
isn't it crazy that getting rid of 
Qaddafi made Libya

1009
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,750
worse?
Well,

1010
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:45,270
it,
it Kadafi here's the,

1011
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,160
that wacky thing.
Kadafi was kind of our guy,

1012
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,143
uh,
on counter terrorism for a few years 

1013
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,610
before he got,
you know,

1014
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,070
got pushed out.
And because he had,

1015
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,980
he had found Jesus and you know,
not literally I guess.

1016
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,701
Yeah,
whatever,

1017
00:39:57,701 --> 00:39:59,090
however they put it.
Um,

1018
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,393
and he had started to cooperate with us 
and then the Arab spring happened and 

1019
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:08,260
then there was this bizarre belief that 
democracy was going to sweep through the

1020
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:09,094
region.
And the Italians and French came to us 

1021
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:10,841
and said,
you know,

1022
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,730
we've got lots of interests there in 
Libya,

1023
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,400
widget back us up.
We had no national security interests in

1024
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:18,730
Libya and yet we went in and we did what
we did and now it's a shit hole.

1025
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:23,260
It's 130 some odd tribes in Libya,
and we're still talking right now.

1026
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:24,094
We're still talking as if somehow we're 
going to find a federal government and 

1027
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,490
that's what's going to help us.

1028
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,910
Because then one of the genitals just 
came out yesterday or today or whenever,

1029
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:32,260
and he said,
well,

1030
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:33,094
I don't think the Olympian Olympians are
gonna be able to take care of isis 

1031
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:38,740
themselves because Isis,
now you've got a very strong,

1032
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:39,783
uh,
holden in Libya because they're smart 

1033
00:40:41,411 --> 00:40:43,480
because they realize they're having 
problems in Syria and Iraq.

1034
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:45,580
They've been looking for another place.
Libya is chaotic.

1035
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:46,721
So the general says,
I,

1036
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:47,554
you know,
what?

1037
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,140
You know,
so once we get this unified government,

1038
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,670
then we can work on training and 
assisting and providing resources and it

1039
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:56,650
just over and over.
So to answer your original question,

1040
00:40:56,651 --> 00:40:58,330
but in a very roundabout way,
yes,

1041
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:58,930
it's,
it's,

1042
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,540
it's tiring because you see the same 
shit

1043
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,310
over and over again.
Yeah.

1044
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,680
I can only imagine.
I can only imagine just trying,

1045
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:11,440
just trying to nation build the scene,
seeing these people that,

1046
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,650
first of all,
you're dealing with completely different

1047
00:41:14,651 --> 00:41:16,450
cultures,
completely different cultures.

1048
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:17,284
Completely different educations.
People who are so backwards so far gone 

1049
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,433
that taking a 45 year old man who is so 
fucked up and crazy and religious and 

1050
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:30,070
trying to convert him to the ways of the
west,

1051
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,323
like these,
these fucking people that executed that 

1052
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:34,110
kid the other day in the middle of 
Iraq's yeah.

1053
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,910
For playing music.
Yeah.

1054
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,700
Because he was playing western music.
They beheaded him.

1055
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,040
Yeah.
Probably don't understand that.

1056
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,020
We can't process it,
but we have never been able to,

1057
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:44,250
you talk about the Viet Cong and we used
to go in and you know,

1058
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,093
we thought we were helping a village and
go into the hockey league village and 

1059
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,220
the Viet Cong in to come in there and 
kill them because,

1060
00:41:48,221 --> 00:41:49,570
you know,
they'd had contact with us.

1061
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,090
One of the first people that we hired,
uh,

1062
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,243
uh,
sometime ago from my company and 

1063
00:41:55,381 --> 00:41:56,530
diligence,
uh,

1064
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,820
for all your information and security 
needs a little plot.

1065
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,663
I don't blog.
One of the first guys we hired was a 

1066
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,880
Russian came out of the,
their gru.

1067
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,590
And,
uh,

1068
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,190
right after we'd gone in for the tour 
bore operation,

1069
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,083
he came to me and he had been a tank 
driver out in Afghanistan during the 

1070
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,730
occupation for the Russians and,
and,

1071
00:42:18,731 --> 00:42:20,270
uh,
and he came and he,

1072
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,930
you could just see,
he was like the intensity on his face,

1073
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,590
you know,
and,

1074
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,423
and,
uh,

1075
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,100
I had known him for a while and so 
anyway,

1076
00:42:27,101 --> 00:42:29,070
he grabbed me and he said,
he said,

1077
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,520
he said that was brilliant.

1078
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,830
He said,
meaning Tora Bora,

1079
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,580
meaning what we have quickly,
we had acted.

1080
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:34,690
He said that was brilliant.
He says,

1081
00:42:34,691 --> 00:42:35,620
don't stay.
He said,

1082
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,120
don't stay.
They're like cockroaches.

1083
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,090
He says [inaudible] meaning you step on 
them here,

1084
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:43,570
they show up over here and you could 
just see in his face and that,

1085
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,670
that son of a bitch was right.
And if I'd been smart,

1086
00:42:45,671 --> 00:42:49,420
I would have dragged him back to the 
states and taking them into the Pentagon

1087
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,180
and had them say that every hour on the 
hour,

1088
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,120
you know,
until somebody figured out what the hell

1089
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:56,970
we should have been doing.
Um,

1090
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,660
but yeah,
we don't,

1091
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,510
we don't seem to listen.
Sometimes you got to jump in.

1092
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:02,344
Sometimes you got to take charge and 
sometimes you need somebody who's in 

1093
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,243
charge.
You need a leader at the top of this 

1094
00:43:06,971 --> 00:43:09,310
food chain around the world because if 
you don't have,

1095
00:43:09,311 --> 00:43:10,144
when you get what we get now,
I would argue that part of the problem 

1096
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:14,770
we have is the administration for 
whatever their motivation,

1097
00:43:14,771 --> 00:43:16,240
whatever their reasons.
And again,

1098
00:43:16,241 --> 00:43:16,810
you know,
fine,

1099
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:17,680
they want to do it.
That's their,

1100
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,593
that's what they're gonna do.
They've stepped off the world stage to 

1101
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:20,914
some degree.
They don't want to be the world's 

1102
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,780
policemen are the world's lead or they 
don't want to be at the top.

1103
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,823
And when you do that,
it's not as if suddenly a community of 

1104
00:43:28,751 --> 00:43:29,584
nations fills that void.
Some other interest is going to try to 

1105
00:43:33,101 --> 00:43:35,730
become the top dog.
That's just the fucking way.

1106
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:36,813
So it's almost like there's a balance 
that's already been achieved and you 

1107
00:43:38,711 --> 00:43:41,140
have to maintain that balance some way 
in some way,

1108
00:43:41,141 --> 00:43:43,380
shape or form.
I would respond to us,

1109
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,520
be at the top of the food chain because 
I think,

1110
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:47,470
and some people will argue and there's 
always,

1111
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:48,304
you know,
the folks who think we never act in 

1112
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:51,700
[inaudible] best interest of anybody and
you just

1113
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,040
pretend I'm them.
Sure.

1114
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,100
It's the greatest terrorist 
organization,

1115
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:56,450
the world,
man.

1116
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,370
Don't you know that's,
you know what?

1117
00:43:58,371 --> 00:44:01,670
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Spin invading countries forever,

1118
00:44:01,671 --> 00:44:03,290
man.
Why don't you just leave them alone just

1119
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:04,250
for oil.
Yeah.

1120
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:07,050
All we want is oil and gemstones,
diamonds.

1121
00:44:07,051 --> 00:44:09,230
We definitely want that stuff.
We didn't want that stuff.

1122
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:10,230
Sure.
Yeah.

1123
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,740
The problem is we want that stuff too,
right?

1124
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,810
So it's,
but it's not that cut and dry.

1125
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:15,644
You've got some fucked up parts of the 
world and the more I talked to people 

1126
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,630
that have been the fall,
those fucked up parts of the world,

1127
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,410
the more that picture is starting to be 
clear and clear.

1128
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,363
The Mar Mar,
I talked to guys like Jocko willink 

1129
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:28,370
who've been over there,
seals,

1130
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,160
people that have served over there.
You get this of this place that's

1131
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,993
not America.
And you get a lot of people that are 

1132
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:39,090
talking about the rest of the world as 
if we're talking about America,

1133
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:41,350
like bad spots in America,
like oil.

1134
00:44:41,351 --> 00:44:42,184
We need to fix Chicago.
Well it says fucking fix in Chicago's 

1135
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,540
Goddamn cake walk compared to fixing 
Cabo or fixing any of these spots in the

1136
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:49,374
world.
Syria.

1137
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,061
Yeah.
And by the way,

1138
00:44:50,061 --> 00:44:50,750
we could,
we could,

1139
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,540
we could be at the top of the global 
food chain and still fixed Chicago.

1140
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,800
Yeah.
We can multitask.

1141
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,910
But in,
I guess that,

1142
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,530
yeah,
I spent enough time behind the curtain,

1143
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,670
a of the u s government and that,
you know,

1144
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:05,420
my,
my view was his college somewhat.

1145
00:45:05,421 --> 00:45:06,254
Right.
And I understand everybody's got their 

1146
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,140
opinions based on their,
their experiences,

1147
00:45:09,141 --> 00:45:10,490
my experiences,
what it is.

1148
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,520
I don't,
I,

1149
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:15,800
I don't believe the US government is out
there to fuck everybody over.

1150
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,690
They,
sometimes they make a mistake.

1151
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,570
We tend to be a pretty self correcting 
nation.

1152
00:45:20,571 --> 00:45:22,400
We try,
sometimes it takes awhile,

1153
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,940
whatever.
But you know,

1154
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,630
we,
I would rather us be the ones up there,

1155
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,860
uh,
trying to,

1156
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,720
to uh,
direct traffic.

1157
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,793
Then some other nations like China or 
Russia or Iran for the Middle East just 

1158
00:45:35,621 --> 00:45:39,290
make decision making and we don't always
get it right.

1159
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,123
Absolutely not.
And you do have to have checks and 

1160
00:45:41,211 --> 00:45:42,720
balances of course your fucking toe.
I mean it's,

1161
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:43,554
you know,
that's,

1162
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:44,960
you know,
that's where people always,

1163
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,113
you know,
fall on one side of there while you're 

1164
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:47,444
just,
all you want to do is steal oil and 

1165
00:45:48,591 --> 00:45:49,640
treasure.
No,

1166
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,773
I just want,
I want to try to ensure that we've got 

1167
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,860
some good intent at the top of the food 
chain and I think the u s is,

1168
00:45:56,861 --> 00:45:59,600
is well positioned for that because we 
try,

1169
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,190
and again,
we don't always get it right,

1170
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:06,020
but we make that effort so people can 
disagree and I'm sure they are right now

1171
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:06,854
saying,
ah,

1172
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,240
he's got an opinion,
but well,

1173
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:10,830
yeah I do.
Well you,

1174
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:11,150
you,

1175
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:11,983
you actually have a qualified opinion 
and that's the difference between your 

1176
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:17,510
opinion and someone who's going,
the United States.

1177
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,520
Man,
we need to stay out of other countries,

1178
00:46:19,521 --> 00:46:20,354
man.
Th I think we need to pay attention to 

1179
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:25,220
what's going on outside of the United 
States for sure.

1180
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,593
I just don't know what you could 
possibly do to sort of smooth over the 

1181
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,950
Middle East and bring them up to date.
I just don't know how you could,

1182
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,660
how do you bring Isis up to date?
How do you say,

1183
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,670
hey guys,
you really,

1184
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,880
you can't execute 15 year old kids for 
listening to rap music.

1185
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,890
You can't,
you can't negotiate.

1186
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:43,843
You can't,
it's not an organization that we're 

1187
00:46:45,741 --> 00:46:47,370
going to be able to deal with in,
in,

1188
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:48,030
in,
in a,

1189
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,830
in a manner that would make us all feel 
happy because we talk them down from,

1190
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,100
you know,
from the ledge and,

1191
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,650
and,
and then I could have committed violence

1192
00:46:54,651 --> 00:46:55,484
anymore.
That's,

1193
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:58,210
that's not going to happen.
Um,

1194
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,160
and you can't also kill your way out of 
it.

1195
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:03,080
There's that,
that's the other part of it.

1196
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:04,430
So how do you do it?
Well,

1197
00:47:04,431 --> 00:47:05,264
you try to,
you try to manage it and you manage it 

1198
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:12,761
in part by not allowing the extremist to
have their own fucking territory because

1199
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:16,370
that,
that caliphate that they'd been Jonesing

1200
00:47:16,371 --> 00:47:17,204
for all this time.
That's one of the reasons why they've 

1201
00:47:19,191 --> 00:47:22,040
been having so much success in 
recruiting foreign fighters.

1202
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,053
And that's when a shit load of people 
going into that place and they do it 

1203
00:47:25,341 --> 00:47:26,390
because,
hey look,

1204
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:27,680
we finally got our own turf.

1205
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:30,160
Now we can take that turf.
Uh,

1206
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:30,641
it's,
it's,

1207
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:31,474
it's now much more problematic because 
we sat on the sidelines for some time 

1208
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:34,624
and the Russians are in there and nobody
wants to get into a shooting match with 

1209
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:37,114
the Russians at this stage of the game.
But denying them territory and then 

1210
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:42,184
realizing that like with cockroaches are
going to pop up over here and then 

1211
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:46,180
they've got a more fun,
they're going to be over here.

1212
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,400
We're just gonna have to play whack a 
mole for the rest of our lives.

1213
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:51,490
Probably this doesn't go away,
but we can minimize it.

1214
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,653
And we can be aggressive enough without 
saying we're going to try to nation 

1215
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:58,630
build and also sell them something that 
they don't understand.

1216
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,120
So I don't know.
I just,

1217
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,320
but,
but I can't,

1218
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:05,530
having sat on the sidelines for a while,
we've created more of a mess,

1219
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,660
um,
at this stage of the game,

1220
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:10,100
the Russian and Iranian influence,
uh,

1221
00:48:10,101 --> 00:48:11,860
in Syria,
uh,

1222
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:12,723
the neurons have more influence in the 
Middle East now than they've had in 

1223
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:16,060
modern times.
And this is this.

1224
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:20,320
They can't imagine their good fortune.
And so now what are we doing one?

1225
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:21,220
Now the headlines are,
look,

1226
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:22,054
they just had elections and the 
reformists are winning as if somehow 

1227
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:28,960
Rod's going to change its tune.
It's insane.

1228
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:31,660
We've had that hope for decades and 
decades,

1229
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,370
and every time there's a little glimmer 
of,

1230
00:48:33,371 --> 00:48:34,510
you know,
maybe the reformist,

1231
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,770
the moderates,
you know,

1232
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:37,670
are going to rise up.
It,

1233
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:38,710
it doesn't happen.

1234
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:39,763
Well,
didn't we have a part of that too 

1235
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:41,870
though,
right?

1236
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,010
Like we're,
we,

1237
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,210
we brought in the ayatollah to get rid 
of the shah.

1238
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,360
Yeah.
I'm,

1239
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,310
they're like,
uh,

1240
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:50,510
well we,
we,

1241
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:51,141
yeah,
we didn't,

1242
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:54,170
so much foam ended as we just stood by 
and watched it happen.

1243
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,700
And so what happened,
I mean,

1244
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,450
it wasn't sort of influenced that at 
all.

1245
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,460
Now the shot was our guy,
the Shah was our gunshot was our guy.

1246
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,680
We brought in the shot though,
right?

1247
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,270
Yeah,
yeah.

1248
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:04,991
I mean we,
we,

1249
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:06,790
and the Shah was a son of a bitch,
you know,

1250
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:08,230
just in the same,
he was,

1251
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:09,590
yeah.
Frankly,

1252
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:12,800
it was not much different than Bashir 
Assad or Assad's Dad.

1253
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:16,370
I got it confused.
So the ayatollah came in and how did the

1254
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:17,204
ayatollah get into,

1255
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:20,250
oh,
he was in exile in France and,

1256
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,533
um,
there had been for some time because of 

1257
00:49:22,941 --> 00:49:26,690
the brutality of the Shaw,
there had been a hard line,

1258
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,230
a clerical uprising,
you know,

1259
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:31,640
sort of directing traffic amongst the 
population.

1260
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,130
And so the Shah who was our guy was 
brutal and he was fucking up.

1261
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,310
Right.
Right.

1262
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:37,144
And he had it,
he had a very brutal intelligence 

1263
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:39,220
service.
And,

1264
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:41,890
uh,
so that was,

1265
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:44,170
yeah,
that wasn't a happy chapter in the sense

1266
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:45,550
of,
um,

1267
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,950
you know,
was the Shah our guy?

1268
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:48,700
Well,
yes,

1269
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,190
but have we had other guys that were,
you know,

1270
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,380
dead spots or,
or not,

1271
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:55,930
not so much.
Desk spots is just really unsavory.

1272
00:49:55,931 --> 00:50:00,931
People that in an ideal world you 
wouldn't want to associate with,

1273
00:50:00,941 --> 00:50:02,710
but the real world doesn't work that 
way.

1274
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,510
There are some fucked up people out 
there.

1275
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:05,344
And the fact of the matter is sometimes 
you got to deal with a person that's 

1276
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:08,820
there.
Oh,

1277
00:50:08,821 --> 00:50:10,180
that was the argument about,

1278
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,130
but what's going on in Iraq,
right?

1279
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,780
No,
that was the audit or the argument about

1280
00:50:14,781 --> 00:50:16,970
Saddam Hussein.
It's about Saddam Hussein was a horrible

1281
00:50:16,971 --> 00:50:18,890
person.
He's a dangerous guy.

1282
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:21,380
But getting rid of them might be worth.

1283
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:22,443
Yeah.
And then there were a number of people 

1284
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:26,560
that said that and what turned that tide
and people will,

1285
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,910
you know,
people like trump himself,

1286
00:50:28,911 --> 00:50:29,571
you know,
ah,

1287
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:30,470
you know,
Bush lied.

1288
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:31,400
People died.
You know,

1289
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:33,890
it was only George Bush who thought 
there was weapons of mass distraction.

1290
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,950
Lady shifted.
He said,

1291
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:36,123
if he gets an office,
he's going to find out the truth about 

1292
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:40,230
who brought the towers down.
Oh my God.

1293
00:50:40,231 --> 00:50:41,690
No,
he's a fucking truther.

1294
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,800
He's a truth or not.
Not only that,

1295
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:46,320
he's also remember,
remember he's a birther,

1296
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,140
he thinks Obama was born in Kenya.
Do you remember that?

1297
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,570
Everybody's conveniently ignored this.
I know.

1298
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,910
Yeah.
Nobody is going after the obvious shit.

1299
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,130
I didn't know,
but I didn't know about that.

1300
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,300
The truth or bit.
Oh my God.

1301
00:50:57,301 --> 00:50:58,200
It just keeps,
it keeps,

1302
00:50:58,201 --> 00:51:00,870
keeps piling on.
This is a recent statement that he made.

1303
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:02,860
Um,
yeah,

1304
00:51:02,861 --> 00:51:03,500
I,
you know what?

1305
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:08,170
It's a,
how does that,

1306
00:51:08,171 --> 00:51:09,400
how again,
how does it,

1307
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:12,490
how does it happen that this country is 
fantastic country?

1308
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,440
Again,
I spent most of my life overseas.

1309
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:18,190
I can go to the deepest,
darkest shit somewhere out there,

1310
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,070
middle of nowhere.
And someone will,

1311
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,840
will say,
if I go to America,

1312
00:51:22,841 --> 00:51:25,750
I can work this hard and I can do really
well.

1313
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:26,711
I just have to,
I,

1314
00:51:26,711 --> 00:51:27,780
you know,
if I can get to America,

1315
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:30,610
they still people out there in the 
middle of nowhere,

1316
00:51:30,611 --> 00:51:31,444
still believe the American dream.
And yet you worry about it because I 

1317
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:38,620
think we seem to be given up on it here.
If this is the best we've got,

1318
00:51:38,621 --> 00:51:40,660
if we're willing to follow this guy,
you know,

1319
00:51:40,661 --> 00:51:42,850
down the down the tunnel.
I don't know.

1320
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:44,920
I know where we're heading,
but it's not good.

1321
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:45,783
And you know,
and I also worry about part of it with 

1322
00:51:48,461 --> 00:51:49,294
Bernie Sanders going back to him is I 
think sometimes the young people who 

1323
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:54,334
support him,
part of it is sort of being 

1324
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,220
disheartened,
you know,

1325
00:51:57,221 --> 00:52:00,430
since 2008 they don't see themselves as 
being part of the American dream.

1326
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:03,700
And if you don't imagine yourself 
working hard and becoming wealthy,

1327
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:06,820
then you don't give a shit whether tax 
rates go up to 85% or not.

1328
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:09,310
It doesn't matter to you because it's 
not going to be you.

1329
00:52:09,311 --> 00:52:10,510
It's going to be somebody else.

1330
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,660
Well,
it's just so confusing to people that no

1331
00:52:13,661 --> 00:52:14,500
one can get it.
Right.

1332
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,930
I mean,
everybody had these hopes and dreams for

1333
00:52:16,931 --> 00:52:19,610
Obama and he was going to get an office.
I remember this,

1334
00:52:19,611 --> 00:52:22,420
this lady that was when Obama got 
elected,

1335
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,860
she was,
uh,

1336
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,400
she was,
she was so happy and she was saying,

1337
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,150
I'm so happy because now I know that if,
uh,

1338
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,400
my mortgage needs to be paid,
he's going to help me.

1339
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:34,234
And it was like,
there's this really weird like moment 

1340
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:38,920
where I realized like,
wow,

1341
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,990
these people don't really understand how
complex this entire system is.

1342
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,540
And you dealing with a guy who's 
stepping into the office,

1343
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,980
right?
When all these banks are failing,

1344
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,143
right?
When all of this collapse is happening 

1345
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,213
and people think that all of a sudden 
this guy's gonna come in and he's going 

1346
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,544
to have a completely different set of 
priorities and he's going to find all 

1347
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:56,980
these people,
you losing your house,

1348
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,930
we're going to fix that.
We're going to get that guy to that.

1349
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,930
There's 300 million people in this 
country,

1350
00:53:01,931 --> 00:53:02,764
ma'am.
And there's not enough money to buy 

1351
00:53:04,241 --> 00:53:07,210
everybody's mortgage back and fix it.
It's just not going to happen.

1352
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,810
We voted the guy into office who had no 
experience.

1353
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,380
He never had a job.

1354
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,213
And yeah,
and,

1355
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,230
and so you get what you get.
And I understand.

1356
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:16,340
Okay,
everybody was excited.

1357
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:18,160
Sure.
Hope and change and all that idea.

1358
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:18,994
It was,
it was very powerful message that they 

1359
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:21,170
were delivering.
It was a smart,

1360
00:53:21,171 --> 00:53:22,004
smart campaign,
but you would think that over a period 

1361
00:53:24,531 --> 00:53:25,980
of time then what we'd really

1362
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,560
want now is somebody,
and again,

1363
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:31,620
I didn't know where to find them,
but if somebody with that combination of

1364
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:34,470
experience and character and a proven 
ability,

1365
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:36,870
a track record to work both sides,
right?

1366
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:37,351
To say,
look,

1367
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:39,120
we're going to be able to negotiate.
We're going to compromise.

1368
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:40,380
We're going to find,
you know,

1369
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,060
it's not rocket fucking science to work 
out some of these problems.

1370
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:46,243
Right.
But the more problems we get and the 

1371
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:50,550
more negative we get about them,
it seems insurmountable.

1372
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:55,050
But we should be able to find somebody 
in this massive country of ours who,

1373
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,640
um,
you know,

1374
00:53:56,641 --> 00:53:57,990
can propose some,
uh,

1375
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,580
clear-eyed ideas.
I don't know.

1376
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,090
Well,
for me it almost seems like taking a guy

1377
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,730
who,
this is analogy that makes sense to me.

1378
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,520
Taking guys never fought before and 
then,

1379
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,383
um,
make him run for the UFC and now all is 

1380
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,600
you're going to fight in the UFC.

1381
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,320
What was your fucking experience 
Fridays?

1382
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,060
I,
you're welcome.

1383
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,740
You don't have any experience.
Like,

1384
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:18,323
you know what I'm saying?
Like all of a sudden this guy gets his 

1385
00:54:19,411 --> 00:54:20,244
job.
It's the most complicated an impossible 

1386
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:22,980
job in the world.
And he's,

1387
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:25,140
he's never,
he's never served.

1388
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:27,840
He's never been overseas.
He's never experienced combat.

1389
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,830
He doesn't know what it means to be 
involved in a war.

1390
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:34,200
He's never been there physically boots 
on the ground.

1391
00:54:34,201 --> 00:54:35,670
Okay.
I'm not saying he has to,

1392
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:38,850
but I'm saying in that help,
but what wouldn't that flavor,

1393
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:43,380
how you would understand and consider 
military action if you had actually been

1394
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:44,214
there,
whether you'd been there like at least 

1395
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:49,380
Bush senior had been in the CIA.
He had been the head of CIA.

1396
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:52,870
Bush Jr was class senior was a World War
II.

1397
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,150
Yes,
that's right.

1398
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,740
Right.
This guy shot down,

1399
00:54:55,780 --> 00:55:00,000
it's Bush senior was probably the most 
qualified guy and to shut up,

1400
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,160
asked her to China,
China,

1401
00:55:02,161 --> 00:55:02,970
head of the CIA.

1402
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,530
A war hero.
Uh,

1403
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:05,880
I mean look the guy,
you know,

1404
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:06,900
but yeah,
you're right.

1405
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:09,810
Shit on now left and right and,
and that's where we're at.

1406
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:10,644
You can't,
you can't disagree with somebody's 

1407
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,100
opinions without crapping on them.
Right?

1408
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:14,911
Yeah.
You can't just say,

1409
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:15,541
look,
I get it.

1410
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:17,490
You've got different opinions than I do.
Yeah.

1411
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:17,941
Okay,
fine.

1412
00:55:17,941 --> 00:55:18,774
Let's talk.
Let's figure out where is the workable 

1413
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,700
solution that you have to have this.
Speaker two,

1414
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,490
this is the other thing.
You have to be this engaging,

1415
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:30,210
entertaining individual who I'd like to 
hear talk.

1416
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,673
I want to hear like one of the things 
that was so great about Obama was how 

1417
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:35,550
good he is.
A giving speeches.

1418
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,370
It's brilliant,
brilliant orator.

1419
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,540
I mean,
he had me,

1420
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:41,250
I was like,
this is my fucking guy.

1421
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,950
Yeah.
I listened to him talk,

1422
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,780
finally got a smart guy.
And as opposed to Bush,

1423
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,930
who was Bush jr who was an awkward sort 
of a guy.

1424
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:49,973
I mean,
w just wasn't that good of a talker and 

1425
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,460
you know,
people would say he's stupid.

1426
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:54,294
He's a dumb guy.
Go back and listen to him when he was 

1427
00:55:55,741 --> 00:55:57,990
running for governor of Texas.
He's not a dumb guy.

1428
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:00,480
No you don't.
You're tired and overwhelmed.

1429
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,120
You don't get,
you don't get to those positions.

1430
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:04,590
You know,
by being an idiot.

1431
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:06,200
You made disagree with people's 
positions.

1432
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:07,600
Like I disagree with Bernie Sanders.
I don't,

1433
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,410
I don't wish him any ill will.
I don't,

1434
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,513
I'm not horrified that he's running.
I think that's the way it works in this 

1435
00:56:13,351 --> 00:56:14,460
country.
Um,

1436
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:18,600
I disagree with the concept of,
of socialism or democratic socialism,

1437
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:19,434
but at the same time I understand and I 
appreciate the fact that that's what he 

1438
00:56:21,751 --> 00:56:23,350
believes and he's believed it for a long
time.

1439
00:56:23,351 --> 00:56:24,184
So great.

1440
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,390
Let's,
you know,

1441
00:56:25,391 --> 00:56:26,081
and,
and you're right,

1442
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:27,190
we should be trying to,
to,

1443
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:28,203
to help people that need a leg up.
We should be trying to provide a safety 

1444
00:56:30,281 --> 00:56:30,850
net,
you know,

1445
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:31,930
for the,
for the people that need it.

1446
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:32,764
We should be trying to at the same time 
promoting the concept of hard work and 

1447
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:38,070
success.
There's,

1448
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,840
there's nothing wrong fucking it all.
There's nothing wrong with success.

1449
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:41,621
You work hard.
It's like,

1450
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:44,040
it's like monopoly.
Monopolies decided they're going to,

1451
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:45,770
I don't know whether for all their board
games now,

1452
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,613
but monopoly is going to take away the 
paper money and give you a bank card 

1453
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,433
wide.
Yeah,

1454
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:51,740
yeah.
That sets,

1455
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,790
I couldn't believe it when I saw Hasbro,
which owns when offaly they said,

1456
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:55,624
well,
we're going to use a bank card for now 

1457
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:57,370
on.
So all those kids out there,

1458
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,413
because I don't know,
maybe they don't want them to learn how 

1459
00:56:59,381 --> 00:57:01,780
to count paper money because maybe it's 
unseemly.

1460
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:04,150
I'm reading something into it.
It's not there obviously,

1461
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:05,650
but it just did not.
Yeah.

1462
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,240
It's part and parcel of my kids.
You know,

1463
00:57:07,241 --> 00:57:11,080
they started a,
they started playing basketball a couple

1464
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,020
seasons ago and uh,
I remember the first league,

1465
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,940
they didn't want to keep score.
Oh yeah.

1466
00:57:15,941 --> 00:57:17,800
That's a big one.
What the fuck?

1467
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,090
Yeah.
You're not allowed to be a loser.

1468
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:19,953
Yeah.
And we don't want to put these kids 

1469
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:21,270
through stress,
but you know what?

1470
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:22,510
I was playing softball.
Nobody.

1471
00:57:22,511 --> 00:57:24,640
One,
what the fuck are you doing?

1472
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,220
Why are you playing?
Get off the field.

1473
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:28,290
Let's go do something else.
If you,

1474
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,040
if nobody's going to wink out to feel 
bad,

1475
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,380
that's part of being a kid.
Feel bad.

1476
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:33,214
And you go,
did fat fucking sucked and then you 

1477
00:57:34,511 --> 00:57:35,450
practice.
And you know what?

1478
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:37,570
And those kids know I could ask my six 
year old,

1479
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:38,404
I could ask,
I could ask sluggo way into the third 

1480
00:57:41,261 --> 00:57:43,510
quarter of a basketball game and say,
what's the score?

1481
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,820
And he would know the scores.
All the kids knew the score,

1482
00:57:45,821 --> 00:57:48,760
they all all keeping score.
And so we're just blowing smoke up,

1483
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:49,930
you know,
the parents asked and,

1484
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:50,340
and,
and,

1485
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,173
and consequently,
we think we're being clever with our 

1486
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:53,320
kids.
The saying,

1487
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:53,741
Hey,
you know,

1488
00:57:53,741 --> 00:57:54,630
this will be fine.
They got,

1489
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:59,920
but I don't know how I got off on this,
but my kid walked off the scooter,

1490
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:01,870
the oldest one walked off the lacrosse 
field,

1491
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:04,270
uh,
and looked at me and he said,

1492
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:05,710
so how'd I do?
And I said,

1493
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:06,261
well,
yeah,

1494
00:58:06,261 --> 00:58:07,094
I don't honestly,
do you want me to be honest or do you 

1495
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:10,530
want me to blow smoke up your ass?
And I,

1496
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,393
I'd said it and I didn't realize it,
where the parents around and they were 

1497
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:14,860
horrified.
And then I got a dressing down.

1498
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,000
And,
uh,

1499
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,890
anybody said,
God bless him.

1500
00:58:17,891 --> 00:58:19,270
He said,
I want you to be honest.

1501
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:19,601
And I said,
well,

1502
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:20,434
you didn't,
you didn't really try as hard as you 

1503
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,061
could.
I said,

1504
00:58:22,061 --> 00:58:23,680
you know,
you don't have to be the best,

1505
00:58:23,681 --> 00:58:24,514
but you got to try really hard.
And the only reason that other kid was 

1506
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:29,590
with scoring on it was because he wanted
it more.

1507
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:31,060
And I said,
and you can do that,

1508
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:31,571
you know,
and,

1509
00:58:31,571 --> 00:58:33,430
and you,
you can tell kids that they're,

1510
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,830
they're not playing their best.
You can in a nice,

1511
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:37,810
you know,
constructive way.

1512
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,973
But God forbid we should,
we should hurt any of these little 

1513
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:42,520
snowflakes,
right?

1514
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:45,160
By telling him this crap,
and now what do we get?

1515
00:58:45,161 --> 00:58:45,994
All those kids that started years ago 
when we started this movement to not 

1516
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:49,624
keep score or anything.
Now they're all at Yale or Amhurst and 

1517
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:54,490
they,
they think that being contradicted means

1518
00:58:54,491 --> 00:58:55,324
they're being persecuted.
And so we created this monster 

1519
00:58:58,841 --> 00:59:00,840
ourselves.
And now a lot of those people that,

1520
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:01,300
you know,
they,

1521
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,133
they look and they don't believe because
they've been told they're victims and 

1522
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:06,520
the system's rigged and they're getting 
fucked every day.

1523
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,710
They don't believe they can be part of 
the system.

1524
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,630
So sure.
They look at Bernie and they think,

1525
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:11,920
yeah,
that's about right.

1526
00:59:11,921 --> 00:59:14,200
That's what we need.
And they find likeminded people.

1527
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,900
They band together,
they all agree on the same thing,

1528
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,830
and they're,
they're,

1529
00:59:17,831 --> 00:59:22,220
they're having a battle right now to try
to see who can be the most open minded,

1530
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,110
the most liberal,
the most accepting.

1531
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:25,123
And that's where the competition is.
The competition is being the most left 

1532
00:59:27,681 --> 00:59:29,670
wing,
the most progressive that they're,

1533
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,470
they're fucking each over other,
over on progressiveness.

1534
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,393
Yeah.
I just asked progressing even the words 

1535
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:36,550
of justice,
it's not even know.

1536
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:36,960
It's,
um,

1537
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,793
it's madness.
It's so,

1538
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,950
Madison isn't even a word.
I can't even have a word for it.

1539
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,711
Yeah.
Progressive.

1540
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:41,740
Making the word.
Yeah.

1541
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,063
George Bush made that up.
We're getting to a weird porn point 

1542
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:46,663
where we're trying to coddle people and 
we're not allowing them to experience 

1543
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:52,274
defeat.
We're not allowing them to experience 

1544
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:56,240
discomfort,
which is how people grow.

1545
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:59,240
When if you don't feel uncomfortable,
you don't learn.

1546
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,253
You don't learn from every mistake that 
I've ever made made me feel like shit 

1547
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:04,340
and that's how I get better at things.

1548
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:05,330
Yeah,
cause you learned.

1549
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:07,640
I don't want to feel that way again.
So how do I get better?

1550
01:00:07,641 --> 01:00:08,660
How do I,
how do I do this?

1551
01:00:08,661 --> 01:00:11,990
But if you don't do it with wrestling,
that's a good question.

1552
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:13,170
That is,
he can get pinned.

1553
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,680
You don't get pinned.
Okay.

1554
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:15,471
Shit.
You know,

1555
01:00:15,471 --> 01:00:18,440
I mean how the fuck they call up before 
you get pins and say,

1556
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:21,860
Oh hey were okay.
You look like you're approaching a pin,

1557
01:00:21,861 --> 01:00:23,780
so let's stop it.
How are they going to do it?

1558
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:25,070
Because I'll tell you what,
man,

1559
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:25,904
I,
this fucking times I got pinned when I 

1560
01:00:27,111 --> 01:00:29,270
was 14 years old.
It's still fuck with my head.

1561
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,210
Cut me.
Carry that.

1562
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,130
All these years in the gym,
lifting weights.

1563
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:34,964
Think about some kid pinned me fucking 
high school and I'll get angry little 

1564
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:39,610
Bobby Schwartz.
That's father fiber.

1565
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,260
I'll start doing extra chin ups for that
prick.

1566
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,410
I'm going to go find.
That's what motivates you,

1567
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,880
motivates you,
you know?

1568
01:00:47,881 --> 01:00:50,160
I mean,
getting tapped out in Jujitsu there,

1569
01:00:50,161 --> 01:00:53,460
there are guys that have tapped me out 
that are literally like,

1570
01:00:53,461 --> 01:00:54,294
when I'm tired,
I will think about them tapping me out 

1571
01:00:56,971 --> 01:00:57,804
and I will push further.
That is the only thing that motivates 

1572
01:01:00,601 --> 01:01:01,434
you is that fee.
What's one of the only things that's 

1573
01:01:03,271 --> 01:01:04,104
really a powerful motivating factor that
everyone can relate to is that feeling 

1574
01:01:07,381 --> 01:01:09,480
of defeat,
that horrible feeling where you go,

1575
01:01:09,481 --> 01:01:10,740
you know what?
I got to get better.

1576
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:12,960
I got to get better because someone's 
better.

1577
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:15,480
And the idea that you're saying that no 
one's ever better,

1578
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,280
you're perfect.
That's not true.

1579
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,200
It's not true.
You get better at stuff.

1580
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,440
There's always somebody that's always 
just like,

1581
01:01:21,441 --> 01:01:22,274
I tell my kids,
because always somebody is going to be 

1582
01:01:23,091 --> 01:01:23,924
bigger than you.
There's always somebody that's going to 

1583
01:01:24,411 --> 01:01:26,000
be smarter than you.
That's fine.

1584
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,490
All you can do is the absolute best you 
can do.

1585
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,470
And you work at it.
And if you fall down,

1586
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,190
you know,
if I could lose,

1587
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:33,510
yeah.
You got to learn how to lose weight,

1588
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:35,960
how to lose as an important part of 
being a grownup.

1589
01:01:35,961 --> 01:01:36,561
But we've got,
I mean,

1590
01:01:36,561 --> 01:01:37,490
look at it,
look at it again.

1591
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,181
Look at this.
The,

1592
01:01:38,181 --> 01:01:39,230
the,
the irony of,

1593
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:42,020
of kids and expensive colleges,
um,

1594
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,270
denigrating free speech because it,
it,

1595
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:47,150
it upsets their feelings.
Rest the fucking kidding me.

1596
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,090
Progressive aggressors.
We've got to look that word up.

1597
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:53,510
Can we get some help on this?
My God.

1598
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:54,590
Yeah.
Well,

1599
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,870
the idea of being a progressive is a 
great idea.

1600
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:57,704
You know,
you want everybody to be equal and you 

1601
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:00,554
want equality as far as law and how 
people are treated and how you address 

1602
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,950
people.
And no one is,

1603
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:11,540
no one starts out in a worse spot.
But once that's established,

1604
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:13,220
then you've got to compete.
Yeah.

1605
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,290
And you have to,
and it's good for everybody.

1606
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:16,370
It's good for you.
It's good for me.

1607
01:02:16,371 --> 01:02:18,230
It's given,
as long as you're competing fairly,

1608
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,540
it,
it generates that competition.

1609
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:25,650
Generates a lot of good things.
First of all,

1610
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:28,350
it generates ambition.
It generates success.

1611
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,213
If you overcome these,
these obstacles that are created by 

1612
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:34,950
competition,
you understand what,

1613
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,920
what needs to be done in order to 
achieve things.

1614
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:38,730
You,
you,

1615
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:39,563
if you're going to go through life and 
you're never going to have any 

1616
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:42,924
obstacles,
you never going to have any character 

1617
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:45,324
testing moments.
You're not even gonna know what you're 

1618
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:47,270
capable.

1619
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:47,970
No,
I just started,

1620
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:50,450
I mean,
and that's not much of a life lived.

1621
01:02:50,451 --> 01:02:50,791
I mean,
at the,

1622
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:52,270
at the end of the day,
if you're not tested and you,

1623
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:55,460
and you're not pushed and you don't,
and you don't fail,

1624
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:57,620
I mean,
I remember times when,

1625
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,473
yeah,
it just,

1626
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:00,660
it didn't even,
uh,

1627
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:01,461
you,
you,

1628
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:03,650
you knew it wasn't going to work out,
right?

1629
01:03:03,651 --> 01:03:04,484
Yeah.
But you just,

1630
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,700
it like you said,
it made you work harder.

1631
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:09,050
It made you push harder and you 
realized,

1632
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:10,401
uh,
it's like,

1633
01:03:10,401 --> 01:03:12,080
you know what it's like,
it's like interrogation trading.

1634
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,850
I don't know.
I don't know why this popped in my head,

1635
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:14,684
but it's interrogation training.
The whole point of interrogation 

1636
01:03:16,191 --> 01:03:17,024
training is to break you down.
So that you realize you've got a point 

1637
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,940
where it's just going to happen.
So an interrogation training,

1638
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,810
like is it training you to be able to 
deal with being interrogated?

1639
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:27,740
Yeah.
So what are they doing?

1640
01:03:27,741 --> 01:03:28,940
But you also have the other side of the 
coin,

1641
01:03:28,941 --> 01:03:29,360
which is,
you know,

1642
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,193
learning,
learning how to navigate and negotiate 

1643
01:03:31,551 --> 01:03:33,440
and all the rest of it.
We like to call it negotiation.

1644
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,240
Um,
so,

1645
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,980
but the idea being is that,
you know,

1646
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:37,651
when you're in,
in a,

1647
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:38,484
in an interrogation training,
the idea is you have to understand that 

1648
01:03:41,211 --> 01:03:43,870
at some point,
no matter who you are is you're,

1649
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,760
it's gonna fall apart.
And then what you need is you need to be

1650
01:03:46,761 --> 01:03:48,830
able to pull yourself back together 
again.

1651
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:52,880
So the idea of interrogation trading in 
part is to show you that hey,

1652
01:03:52,881 --> 01:03:54,860
you can go farther than you thought you 
could,

1653
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:56,660
but also at some point you're just going
to say,

1654
01:03:56,661 --> 01:03:57,600
fuck it.
I May.

1655
01:03:57,601 --> 01:03:58,071
Because,
uh,

1656
01:03:58,071 --> 01:03:59,570
you know,
depending on where we're at,

1657
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:02,720
you know you're going to break.
I mean,

1658
01:04:02,721 --> 01:04:04,880
it's going to happen.
And when you do,

1659
01:04:04,881 --> 01:04:06,860
you've got gotta be able to,
otherwise you're just a puddle of Goo,

1660
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:07,753
right?
You've got to pull yourself back 

1661
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:10,850
together again.
So it's a bit like that failure.

1662
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:13,430
Like you said,
failure teaches success.

1663
01:04:13,431 --> 01:04:16,730
Failure drives success.
Unless,

1664
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:19,610
you know,
unless we teach waning a culture of just

1665
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:22,260
fucking mediocrity and what we are.
Yeah,

1666
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:23,123
we are.
Yeah.

1667
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,590
Well that's a happy sign.

1668
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:26,730
I have to learn the consequences.
We Egan,

1669
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,070
no,
you can't nerf the world.

1670
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,350
You have to learn the consequences of 
fucking up.

1671
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:32,750
And if you don't learn the consequences 
of fucking up,

1672
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:33,613
you never understand what it takes.
There are people that work harder than 

1673
01:04:36,861 --> 01:04:37,694
you.
There are people that are smarter than 

1674
01:04:38,211 --> 01:04:39,470
you.
They're people that want it more.

1675
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,030
There are people that are more 
ambitious.

1676
01:04:41,031 --> 01:04:43,850
There are people that are more intense 
and more focused and more disciplined.

1677
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,980
And if there are not,
then somehow or another,

1678
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:48,740
we're all perfect and equal.
And that's not the case.

1679
01:04:48,741 --> 01:04:50,270
And that's not the case.
Well,

1680
01:04:50,271 --> 01:04:52,580
this,
this competition fuels everything.

1681
01:04:52,581 --> 01:04:53,414
We have like,
look,

1682
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:56,750
here's a perfect example.
Every year cars get faster.

1683
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:57,643
Why do they get faster?
Because they're fucking competing 

1684
01:04:58,641 --> 01:05:01,760
against each other.
Chevy is competing against this company.

1685
01:05:01,761 --> 01:05:02,594
They're competing against forward and 
they're all trying to make a car that 

1686
01:05:04,431 --> 01:05:06,180
goes zero to 60 and a half,
a second night,

1687
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,480
and every fucking year they get closer 
to that.

1688
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:09,523
I mean,
there's one reason for that and it's 

1689
01:05:11,721 --> 01:05:15,320
because there's other cars out there 
that are doing a better job there.

1690
01:05:15,321 --> 01:05:17,590
Skid pad and numbers are getting higher 
there.

1691
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,590
Quarter mile numbers are getting lower.
They're getting faster,

1692
01:05:20,591 --> 01:05:22,420
they're handled better,
they're getting safer.

1693
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:24,880
All they're doing this because of 
competition.

1694
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,580
And that's the only thing that fuels 
innovation.

1695
01:05:27,581 --> 01:05:31,420
Competition fuels innovation and this 
desire that everybody has to,

1696
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:33,460
I want to get the newest,
greatest shit.

1697
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,391
Right.
You know,

1698
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:35,224
and that's where they talked about cars.
We were talking about phones where 

1699
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:38,170
they're told what it doesn't matter what
it is.

1700
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:38,741
Yeah,
it's everything.

1701
01:05:38,741 --> 01:05:41,590
Human beings look whilst they have the 
Olympic records,

1702
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:42,573
why?
Why is everybody trying to break 

1703
01:05:43,751 --> 01:05:46,540
records?
I mean in the UFC we're constantly going

1704
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,310
over statistics.
This guys,

1705
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:51,010
one more fights.
This guys landed more significant blows.

1706
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:53,280
This guys landed more submissions.
These,

1707
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:53,950
these,
you're,

1708
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:54,850
you're competing.

1709
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:59,890
This is why people like watching things 
like the UFC is because it's contrary to

1710
01:05:59,891 --> 01:06:00,724
this participation shit that's going on.
There's a participation trophy bullshit 

1711
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,820
that's going on with little kids.
And,

1712
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,630
and like I said,
I go back to that same point,

1713
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:08,464
which is it,
we're not fooling any of them in a 

1714
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:11,860
sense,
over a period of time,

1715
01:06:11,861 --> 01:06:14,230
we create a bad precedent and a bad 
mentality.

1716
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,620
But at that moment that kids know what 
the hell this score is,

1717
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:19,220
they know what the hell is going on.
And they,

1718
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,260
you know,
and they know that it's,

1719
01:06:20,261 --> 01:06:23,110
it's bullshit when you tell them they're
wonderful every time that they're not,

1720
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:24,220
I mean,
if I told my kid,

1721
01:06:24,221 --> 01:06:25,054
you know,
every time he finished a practice or a 

1722
01:06:25,601 --> 01:06:26,830
sports game,
you know,

1723
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:27,910
hey,
you did great.

1724
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:28,420
I mean,
it would,

1725
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,253
it means fuck all.
It means nothing to them at a certain 

1726
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:31,570
point.

1727
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:34,750
And then he loses when he loses respect,
but he looses also motivation.

1728
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:35,111
He thinks,
well,

1729
01:06:35,111 --> 01:06:36,190
fine,
if I'm great all the time,

1730
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:36,911
what the fuck?
I don't,

1731
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:37,744
you know,
better thing to tell them is you know 

1732
01:06:39,311 --> 01:06:42,400
this horrible feeling that you've got in
your stomach right now.

1733
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:45,730
Use that as fuel.
Fuel yourself with the fuck ups.

1734
01:06:45,731 --> 01:06:46,564
Fuel yourself with the failures,
but it doesn't mean we love you less 

1735
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:50,493
like your,
your parents and your friends are going 

1736
01:06:52,421 --> 01:06:54,190
to love you no matter what.
You know,

1737
01:06:54,191 --> 01:06:55,024
Randy coture said this to me once.
We were talking about fighters and how 

1738
01:06:57,941 --> 01:06:58,774
he talks to fighters that he's training 
and he said the most important thing is 

1739
01:07:02,261 --> 01:07:03,094
you can't be afraid to lose.
It's going to happen at one point in 

1740
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:07,900
time.
If you keep fighting,

1741
01:07:07,901 --> 01:07:11,180
everybody loses.
But you have to think to yourself what,

1742
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:12,790
what is important in life?

1743
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,950
Your family loving you,
you're friends loving you,

1744
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,410
they're still going to love you.
They're still you.

1745
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:17,244
It's still going to be all,
all those pieces are going to be in 

1746
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:21,100
place.
If you lose except that,

1747
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:24,640
and then go out there and do your best.
And as long as you've done your best,

1748
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:30,060
you can keep your chin up and you can,
you can understand that whatever failure

1749
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:33,550
that you've experienced there,
whatever mistake,

1750
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:34,563
this is a,
this is like a mathematical problem 

1751
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:38,560
you've learned,
well you can't throw a one,

1752
01:07:38,561 --> 01:07:41,350
two and then drop your left hand.
You get hit with a counter right now.

1753
01:07:41,351 --> 01:07:42,184
You know,
but if you don't get hit with that 

1754
01:07:43,301 --> 01:07:44,440
counter right,
you'd never know.

1755
01:07:44,441 --> 01:07:46,030
If you go through life just throwing a 
one,

1756
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:48,820
two and winning every time you think 
you've got the perfect game plan,

1757
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,180
then you,
you,

1758
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:52,930
you teach that to someone else and that,
that person realizes,

1759
01:07:52,931 --> 01:07:54,460
well no,
this game plan's no good.

1760
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,070
You got to keep your fucking hands up.
If you don't keep your hands up,

1761
01:07:57,071 --> 01:07:58,030
you get hit these,
these,

1762
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,510
there's a certain reality is,
it's one of the reasons why I keep going

1763
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:02,344
back to fighting,
but it's one of the reasons why people 

1764
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:05,290
like fighting cause it's so absolute,
right.

1765
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:08,170
Absolutely.
Going to decisions because decisions can

1766
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:10,780
be fucking bullshit.
But other than decisions,

1767
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,090
when someone hits you,
they hit you and they don't hit.

1768
01:08:13,091 --> 01:08:15,130
You know,
it's very clear.

1769
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,220
It's very decisive

1770
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:18,230
for the most part.
And you know,

1771
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:19,670
there,
there is no fucking about,

1772
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:20,121
it's,
it's,

1773
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:20,954
it is what it is as opposed to so much 
of the rest of the world or what you're 

1774
01:08:23,961 --> 01:08:25,590
trying to find examples of whatever 
words

1775
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,730
gray and murky and I don't know if they 
same as a score of all goes in the net.

1776
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,770
It goes in the net.
That's it.

1777
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:36,860
It goes in or it doesn't go in.
And to raise kids to this,

1778
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:41,400
to have this foggy concept in their head
that it doesn't matter.

1779
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,331
Well,
no,

1780
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:44,550
it does matter.
It fucking matters a lot.

1781
01:08:44,551 --> 01:08:45,384
Right?
Here's what does,

1782
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:48,000
here's what doesn't matter.
Your parents are going to love you.

1783
01:08:48,001 --> 01:08:48,834
Your friends going to love you if your 
parents don't love you because you 

1784
01:08:50,851 --> 01:08:53,310
didn't drop a ball in that.
Your Dad's a piece of shit.

1785
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,040
And that's something we all need to 
laugh.

1786
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:56,913
Yeah.
And there are there we all experienced 

1787
01:09:00,301 --> 01:09:01,050
folks.
Yeah,

1788
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:01,861
we've all seen,
I mean,

1789
01:09:01,861 --> 01:09:03,350
I've,
I've seen him on the side and one of my,

1790
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:04,403
my kid was going to soccer practice.
I was watching his dad screaming his 

1791
01:09:07,231 --> 01:09:08,910
daughter and it was like,
God damn it,

1792
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:09,990
dude.
Don't do that.

1793
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,760
Go.
So let's go hustle.

1794
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,713
Let's go hustle.
And you're like all the fucking sports 

1795
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:16,170
terminology.
Let's get that one.

1796
01:09:16,171 --> 01:09:18,660
We can get need to get that one back.
We gotta get that one line.

1797
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:21,390
If you're a parent and you're living 
your life through your kids,

1798
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:23,460
sporting exploits,
go,

1799
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:24,303
go fucking do something else.
Encourage them and give them what they 

1800
01:09:26,851 --> 01:09:28,560
need to succeed.
But don't,

1801
01:09:28,561 --> 01:09:32,160
don't value yourself through what your 
kids are doing and sports.

1802
01:09:32,161 --> 01:09:33,740
And there's so many parents out there 
that did that.

1803
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,660
I,
I coached for a while.

1804
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:36,780
Uh,
my daughter,

1805
01:09:36,781 --> 01:09:41,420
who's now in college,
she played a lot of softball.

1806
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:43,140
And so I was coaching at one point,
you know,

1807
01:09:43,141 --> 01:09:45,270
before she got to the point where I had 
nothing to offer.

1808
01:09:45,271 --> 01:09:47,190
And so they had to actually get coaches 
who knew what they were doing.

1809
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,120
But I remember at one point there was 
this one dad who was just like,

1810
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:50,993
he was just a complete douche and he was
always a Douche and he'd just show up 

1811
01:09:53,611 --> 01:09:54,444
and he'd,
and he'd berate his kid and his kid was 

1812
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:56,840
fantastic.

1813
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:57,723
She was a wonderful,
and one time she actually walked up to 

1814
01:09:59,911 --> 01:10:02,400
me and she was as she was,
you could tell she wanted to cry,

1815
01:10:02,401 --> 01:10:03,234
but she didn't choose it.
She was a great kid and she apologized 

1816
01:10:05,821 --> 01:10:08,370
for her dad's behavior in the dugout 
because the dad,

1817
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,260
she's like leaning over the fence and 
screaming.

1818
01:10:10,261 --> 01:10:14,430
And how long was he at that time?
She was 14 I guess.

1819
01:10:14,431 --> 01:10:15,151
And it was just,
and I said,

1820
01:10:15,151 --> 01:10:16,620
look honey,
it's not your deal.

1821
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:18,060
Your,
it's not your fault.

1822
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:19,680
And then I had to go over and I said,
look,

1823
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:21,103
you have fucking Douche.
And I said that to him and he was eight 

1824
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:24,600
and I thought he was going to try to 
take my head off,

1825
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:25,650
but he was a,
he was a big boy,

1826
01:10:25,651 --> 01:10:28,980
but he couldn't argue with me.
I think he knew deep down he knew.

1827
01:10:28,981 --> 01:10:29,551
Yeah,
okay,

1828
01:10:29,551 --> 01:10:30,610
the guys right.
I am a Douche.

1829
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:31,351
And I said,
you've got to leave.

1830
01:10:31,351 --> 01:10:32,184
You can't come back.
And for a kid to apologize for their 

1831
01:10:34,951 --> 01:10:36,170
parent's behavior,
but yeah,

1832
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:36,960
you're right.
You see it,

1833
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,040
you see it fairly often.

1834
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:38,933
Parents get fucking heated up.
There was a crazy story about a dad who 

1835
01:10:40,981 --> 01:10:45,060
killed a another dad in a hockey fight.
Yes.

1836
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,190
You remember that?
I remember that the kids were playing,

1837
01:10:47,191 --> 01:10:48,024
the kids apparently had got into it on 
the ice and this fucking big giant guy 

1838
01:10:51,991 --> 01:10:52,824
beat a guy to death,
beat the guy to death in front of his 

1839
01:10:55,921 --> 01:10:56,620
kid.

1840
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:57,520
There was another guy,
this guy,

1841
01:10:57,521 --> 01:10:59,320
I think it was in Connecticut,
softball also.

1842
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:00,930
It's girl's softball,
you know,

1843
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:01,873
they get very competitive,
but how the fuck do you get so wound up 

1844
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:05,470
about,
about any really,

1845
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,880
really anything.
But so this guy,

1846
01:11:06,881 --> 01:11:07,714
this dad went after,
literally got upset because their kid 

1847
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:12,910
wasn't getting enough playing time and 
so the coach turned and walked away.

1848
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,773
The picked up a bat and went after him 
and hit him in the head with a bat and 

1849
01:11:16,681 --> 01:11:17,720
put them in the hospital.
Yeah,

1850
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,350
yeah,
yeah.

1851
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:20,410
I remember that.
Yeah.

1852
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:21,480
He hit the coach,
right?

1853
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,110
Yeah,
he did.

1854
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:22,681
Yeah.
Yeah.

1855
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:24,670
Cause kid wasn't getting enough light.
I mean,

1856
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:25,381
okay.
Yeah.

1857
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:26,520
Have you ever,
my daughter needs more plain

1858
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:27,523
competition then that's,
that's what people are afraid of with 

1859
01:11:29,491 --> 01:11:30,324
competition.
That's why they're coming up with this 

1860
01:11:31,171 --> 01:11:32,004
idea of participation trophies.
There's a lot of people that are moving 

1861
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:39,210
away or trying to move away from this.
They want a kinder,

1862
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:42,240
gentler world and they think that that's
the way to do it.

1863
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:43,311
I,
that's why I'm,

1864
01:11:43,311 --> 01:11:44,550
I'm happy to be out in Idaho.
We don't,

1865
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:47,270
we don't necessarily go for the kinder,
gentler world outside.

1866
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:48,530
It's too fucking cold.
And Yeah,

1867
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:52,200
I can call you got coyotes and wolves 
and bears and shit that I got to eat you

1868
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:53,730
and uh,
and yeah,

1869
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:54,564
so it,
it's very much just sort of pull your 

1870
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:56,880
boots up and just get on with it.
It's a,

1871
01:11:56,881 --> 01:11:58,620
it's a very good,
uh,

1872
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:01,620
culture out there and it's a great place
to raise,

1873
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:02,880
raise kids,
you know?

1874
01:12:02,881 --> 01:12:05,100
And,
and I couldn't be happier because it's,

1875
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:07,170
the outdoor activities are just 
fantastic.

1876
01:12:07,171 --> 01:12:08,004
The climbing and the rafting or 
incredible skiing is obviously great 

1877
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:13,320
fishing and hunting is fantastic.
I mean,

1878
01:12:13,321 --> 01:12:14,810
I sound like the Chamber of Commerce,
you know,

1879
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,410
you do,
but it is a beautiful place.

1880
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:18,940
Yeah.
I have a friend who has a house in Coeur

1881
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:21,120
d'alene and they send me pictures and 
you're just like,

1882
01:12:21,121 --> 01:12:21,900
Jesus Christ.

1883
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,550
That's real.
That's a real place.

1884
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:26,370
You can fly up to spokane and that's the
easiest way to get to quote Atlanta.

1885
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:27,770
Yeah.
You drive beds.

1886
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:29,940
It's about 40 minutes or so.
That's it from spokane.

1887
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:30,774
But if you drive from,
if you fly into boise and you drive up 

1888
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:34,740
to core Delaney to take you about a 
century and a half,

1889
01:12:34,741 --> 01:12:36,850
it takes a while cause it's got to big 
fucking state.

1890
01:12:36,851 --> 01:12:37,684
Yeah.
Yeah.

1891
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,630
But it's a,
it's uh,

1892
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:39,541
again,
it's,

1893
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:40,374
it's,
it's interesting because that Wyoming 

1894
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:45,420
and Montana,
that whole part of the country or the,

1895
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,570
yeah,
it's just still a little bit different.

1896
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:49,603
You know,
the urban centers are all starting to 

1897
01:12:51,811 --> 01:12:54,060
kind of unify it and become a little bit
similar.

1898
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:55,100
But I think when people,

1899
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,003
we'll have to deal with nature when 
they're dealing with winter and storms 

1900
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:04,020
and,
and just the reality of being in nature.

1901
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,273
It humbles you.
And it also hardens you a little bit to 

1902
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:08,634
the realities of changing climates and 
the realities of just wild life and all 

1903
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:18,000
the dangers and all the wonderful things
that come from nature

1904
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:19,011
and,
and that's it.

1905
01:13:19,011 --> 01:13:19,844
And the expansiveness of it.
And it kind of humbles you a little bit 

1906
01:13:21,501 --> 01:13:23,240
and you can you drive up what got we,
we're not,

1907
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,850
we're very fortunate.
We're not that far from yellowstone.

1908
01:13:25,851 --> 01:13:26,930
I mean not far being,
you know,

1909
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:30,610
a handful of hours drive and you go off 
to a place and if people haven't,

1910
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,090
their listening haven't been to 
yellowstone,

1911
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:32,870
good guide.
You know,

1912
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:35,810
do yourself a favor and go there.
Don't go during a high tourist season.

1913
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:38,810
But if you want to see something that 
just is stunning,

1914
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:41,630
spend a few days up in yellowstone and 
it really does,

1915
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,680
it puts you back a little bit and it 
makes you realize a how,

1916
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,210
how amazing,
you know,

1917
01:13:47,211 --> 01:13:48,320
this,
this planet is b,

1918
01:13:48,321 --> 01:13:50,670
how incredible this country is.
And it,

1919
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:54,080
and it also kind of puts your priorities
a little bit more in shape.

1920
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,900
We try,
we attract a bunch of grizzlies up there

1921
01:13:56,901 --> 01:13:58,490
for a travel channel show.

1922
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,390
And there were times when you just,
you'd forget what you were doing.

1923
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:04,520
You just stand there and just stare out 
there at the,

1924
01:14:04,521 --> 01:14:06,410
at the scenery and you just,
you know,

1925
01:14:06,411 --> 01:14:07,244
there was,
and of course it was a travel channel 

1926
01:14:08,001 --> 01:14:09,170
show.
I was supposed to be co hosting and,

1927
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:10,850
and yet I was just gobsmacked.
I didn't have the,

1928
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:12,630
you know,
which is not good for a cohost.

1929
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,190
Apparently you're supposed to be able to
describe what you're seeing.

1930
01:14:15,191 --> 01:14:16,030
And I would just say,
man,

1931
01:14:16,031 --> 01:14:17,230
this is fucking incredible.
They say,

1932
01:14:17,231 --> 01:14:18,064
okay,
you can't say that and say that I 

1933
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:23,410
allowed to travel journal and beep.
But yeah,

1934
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:25,360
you would think so.
I don't think they wanted,

1935
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,680
you didn't want that impression.
Um,

1936
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,870
so,
but yeah,

1937
01:14:28,871 --> 01:14:29,910
getting,
just getting out,

1938
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,250
seeing,
seeing that environment,

1939
01:14:32,251 --> 01:14:36,480
seeing the wild bison and buffalo and 
wolves and all the,

1940
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:38,100
just the,
the landscape

1941
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,410
and you learn also where your food comes
from.

1942
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,730
Right.
And I think that's part of it too.

1943
01:14:41,731 --> 01:14:42,770
And that,
that tough,

1944
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:44,160
it's like my kids,
you know,

1945
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:45,690
they know where their food comes from.
They know,

1946
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:48,030
you know what it takes to go out 
hunting.

1947
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,710
They know what,
what fishing's all about.

1948
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:52,290
They understand it.
You develop a respect for it.

1949
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:54,480
You understand that the world's not 
equal,

1950
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:55,471
you know,
I mean,

1951
01:14:55,471 --> 01:14:57,870
all those precious uh,
animals out,

1952
01:14:57,871 --> 01:14:59,630
those bison are going to get a baby 
bison.

1953
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:02,010
I watched the baby buys and get dragged 
down and you think,

1954
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:03,720
you know,
and I was with somebody who was on the,

1955
01:15:03,721 --> 01:15:06,260
on the production team that was like,
well we should enter,

1956
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,293
we should,
you know,

1957
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:08,183
get in there and help that.
What does it getting dragged down by 

1958
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,500
getting dragged down by walls and it 
wasn't,

1959
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:13,343
you guys were there while this was how 
they've actually yellowstone's did a 

1960
01:15:15,901 --> 01:15:16,734
wonderful job of bringing back a number 
of things and there it says a fairly 

1961
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,020
active wolf population up there.

1962
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:24,600
The bears are looking great,
the grizzlies and everything and says,

1963
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,740
but the point being is that,
you know,

1964
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,760
if you grow up out there I think,
or if you spend a lot of time out there,

1965
01:15:29,761 --> 01:15:33,570
you want to stand that yet life isn't,
isn't fair.

1966
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,433
Right.
And if we just keep telling our kids 

1967
01:15:35,671 --> 01:15:40,170
that life is fair and everybody gets to 
be equal and it's not the way it works.

1968
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:43,350
And even in the human species,
it's not the way it works.

1969
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,150
Like you said,
somebody is always going to be harder,

1970
01:15:45,151 --> 01:15:46,110
tougher,
smarter,

1971
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:49,770
more intense.
And that's a good thing.

1972
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:50,790
Well it does.
It is.

1973
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:54,720
Here's the thing though,
it doesn't make you less of a person.

1974
01:15:54,721 --> 01:15:59,070
It doesn't make you love the less,
and I think people value there.

1975
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:02,670
There's a,
there's a real problem when people think

1976
01:16:02,671 --> 01:16:06,030
that winning is the only thing,
cause this is not the only thing,

1977
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:06,893
but there's a,
there's a giant spectrum of things that 

1978
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:12,300
we value.
We value comradery,

1979
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:13,134
we value friendship.
We value intelligence in a sense of 

1980
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:17,094
humor.
And someone who's interesting and 

1981
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:21,260
fascinating to talk to.
Well,

1982
01:16:21,261 --> 01:16:26,070
there's so many things that people value
out of a human being that being the best

1983
01:16:26,071 --> 01:16:29,370
at one thing that you compete in is not 
the only thing in life.

1984
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:30,613
And this is a real problem with athletes
once they retire because all of their 

1985
01:16:33,601 --> 01:16:34,434
sense of self worth a lot of times is 
wrapped up in competition and they have 

1986
01:16:39,691 --> 01:16:44,040
been obsessed with greatness and then 
afterwards they feel this like hollow,

1987
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:46,530
sad life.
It's a big issue with fighters.

1988
01:16:46,531 --> 01:16:48,710
A gigantic issue with fighters 
[inaudible] fine.

1989
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,250
Something that that takes that over 
right?

1990
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:54,120
A lot of times they turned to drugs 
because the,

1991
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:54,963
the high of competing is so intense.
Like so many classic situations were 

1992
01:16:59,901 --> 01:17:02,650
great fighters turned to drugs.
Joe Lewis,

1993
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,310
um,
Sonny Liston,

1994
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:05,810
I mean there's,
you can go down the line,

1995
01:17:05,811 --> 01:17:06,591
Aaron,
prior,

1996
01:17:06,591 --> 01:17:10,250
there's a lot of great fighters who 
turned to drugs later in their life

1997
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:12,890
because they just didn't know what the 
fuck to do.

1998
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:13,640
Right,
right.

1999
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,800
You're always looking for something 
that's going to fill that void,

2000
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:16,634
I think.
And then one of my brothers is a flew f 

2001
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:20,170
four is in Vietnam,
uh,

2002
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:21,300
for a couple of tours.
And,

2003
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,300
and he was one of those guys,
he was like,

2004
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:24,134
that was it guy's name,
Robert Duval's character and apocalypse 

2005
01:17:28,461 --> 01:17:29,820
now.
Just one of those guys that,

2006
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:35,150
you know,
he appreciated the moment.

2007
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:36,163
Right.
And he appreciated the rush that he was 

2008
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:39,710
getting smell flying home in the 
morning.

2009
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:40,600
Oh yeah.
I mean,

2010
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:41,460
and so,
you know,

2011
01:17:41,461 --> 01:17:42,980
and by the point being is that,
you know,

2012
01:17:42,981 --> 01:17:44,450
he came back and it was like,
you know,

2013
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:44,991
now,
I mean,

2014
01:17:44,991 --> 01:17:45,824
he's a great guy.
He ended up being a senior pilot of the 

2015
01:17:47,571 --> 01:17:49,550
commercial airline and he's never had an
issue.

2016
01:17:49,551 --> 01:17:50,384
But at the same time,
you can always tell that when you sit 

2017
01:17:52,221 --> 01:17:53,960
down and you know,
over over some drinks,

2018
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,000
you know,
there's always that that was,

2019
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:57,740
you know,
that moment in time,

2020
01:17:57,741 --> 01:17:58,574
you know,
that was that event or that was that 

2021
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:03,800
activity that I don't know what you ever
fill that again.

2022
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,020
You don't ever get to that point again 
where it's you're,

2023
01:18:06,021 --> 01:18:08,110
you're experiencing that same sort of 
rush or that,

2024
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:09,111
that,
that,

2025
01:18:09,111 --> 01:18:09,944
uh,
that challenge when you get addicted to 

2026
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:15,710
hitting 11 when everybody else is 
hitting six on a good day,

2027
01:18:15,711 --> 01:18:17,990
a crazy day.
Today I got up to six,

2028
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,330
you know,
imagine if your truck with Dell,

2029
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:21,760
you know,
he's like,

2030
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:23,300
oh,
what did you do today?

2031
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:25,670
You did a fucking mile.
You ran a mile.

2032
01:18:25,671 --> 01:18:27,200
You fuck.
You know,

2033
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:29,043
it's like the,
the idea of danger and reward of 

2034
01:18:33,381 --> 01:18:34,940
consequence.
These are,

2035
01:18:34,941 --> 01:18:35,774
these are all there so intense to 
someone who's been involved in like 

2036
01:18:40,131 --> 01:18:43,160
really heavy competition.
I see with fighters all the time,

2037
01:18:43,161 --> 01:18:46,310
this very reluctant decision that they 
have,

2038
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:49,730
they're very reluctant to step away from
the game when they've been knocked out a

2039
01:18:49,731 --> 01:18:50,564
bunch of times and they start to lose 
their chin and they start to experience 

2040
01:18:53,961 --> 01:18:54,794
some cognitive issues and it's so hard 
for them and they need someone to step 

2041
01:18:58,641 --> 01:19:00,140
in and grab them and go,
listen to me,

2042
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:02,420
man,
if you don't get out now,

2043
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:05,690
it's going to get real ugly in the next 
couple of years.

2044
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:06,523
And you could,
you could reach a point where you're 

2045
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:10,700
never going to bounce back.
You get a few more knockouts,

2046
01:19:10,701 --> 01:19:11,534
three,
four more knockouts and you might be 

2047
01:19:12,561 --> 01:19:13,394
fucked for the rest of your life.
And we see it now with a lot of NFL 

2048
01:19:15,741 --> 01:19:16,580
players.
We,

2049
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,680
we've definitely seen it with a lot of 
fighters.

2050
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:19,431
I mean,
Jesus,

2051
01:19:19,431 --> 01:19:20,264
look at the greatest of all time,
the greatest boxer of all time is a 

2052
01:19:23,151 --> 01:19:23,984
physical wreck.
Mohammed Ali is in the worst shape of 

2053
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:29,853
like literally any public figure that 
has ever been so graceful and beautiful 

2054
01:19:34,281 --> 01:19:35,114
and as Moose Mints and the weight talked
and so charismatic and now you look at 

2055
01:19:38,601 --> 01:19:41,300
him and he cannot talk at all.
He cannot walk.

2056
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,450
That is a direct consequence of boxing.
Like you said,

2057
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:46,220
look at the NFL and look at what they're
finding now.

2058
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:48,160
And that's,
you know,

2059
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,850
that that's filtered down to the youth.
You know,

2060
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:52,490
you don't have a full contact football 
at an early age.

2061
01:19:52,491 --> 01:19:53,870
That's a good move.
It's a good move.

2062
01:19:53,871 --> 01:19:54,704
Yeah.
A lot of parents are just refusing to 

2063
01:19:56,571 --> 01:19:58,040
have their kid play,
play football.

2064
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:00,470
Well,
I have friends that you know,

2065
01:20:00,471 --> 01:20:01,030
they,
they'll,

2066
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:02,960
they would let their kids fight,
they'll let their kids fight,

2067
01:20:02,961 --> 01:20:05,130
but they won't let the kids get involved
in,

2068
01:20:05,131 --> 01:20:06,560
in football because they're like,
look,

2069
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:08,100
if you fight and you get

2070
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:08,933
really good,
it's you and one guy and you might get 

2071
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:12,810
hit and you're probably going to get 
hit.

2072
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:13,853
But if you do your diligence and you 
work on your technique and you 

2073
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:16,824
understand footwork and you understand 
the rules of engagement and you 

2074
01:20:19,321 --> 01:20:20,154
understand like correct strategy as far 
as movement and do all your work in the 

2075
01:20:24,211 --> 01:20:26,940
gym and understand how to defense number
one,

2076
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:28,710
that's the number one most important 
thing.

2077
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,053
If you do that,
you're going to mitigate a lot of that 

2078
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:32,370
issue.
You're going to the,

2079
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:35,460
there's a lot of fighters that walk away
from the game and they're okay.

2080
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,740
It is possible to do look at Floyd 
Mayweather.

2081
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:39,480
Yeah.
Fucking guys 49 and,

2082
01:20:39,481 --> 01:20:41,860
oh and he's fine.
You might not like them but Shitty,

2083
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,140
right?
He doesn't get hit.

2084
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:44,633
He doesn't get hit.
I mean the difference between him and a 

2085
01:20:47,731 --> 01:20:48,564
guy who decides to bite down on his 
mouthpiece and just slug it out and to 

2086
01:20:51,751 --> 01:20:52,584
see whose last man standing.
There's a giant difference in his 

2087
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:56,634
strategy and the consequences of his 
strategy versus a guy who just likes to 

2088
01:20:59,941 --> 01:21:00,774
put on a show for the fans.
Well that guy is going to be in a 

2089
01:21:02,281 --> 01:21:03,910
fucking wheelchair when he's older.
Yeah.

2090
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:07,310
But I just,
the other day I had to deal with the was

2091
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,163
sluggo the middle boy who said,
you know you want him cause he's been a 

2092
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:10,823
Johnson to play football.
And so then he found out that the only 

2093
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:16,380
league available was flag football and 
he looked at me,

2094
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,060
he's not that he's what?
He's almost seven.

2095
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,160
And he says,
well what's the point that was,

2096
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:21,600
that was his comments.
What's the point?

2097
01:21:21,601 --> 01:21:22,051
I said,
well honey,

2098
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:24,140
I don't know what the point is.
Yeah,

2099
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:25,830
you raised an interesting question.
I said,

2100
01:21:25,831 --> 01:21:28,170
so let's,
let's just focus on on other sports,

2101
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:29,004
get them involved in Jujitsu.
That's what I always tell someone who's 

2102
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:32,310
gonna,
who's got it

2103
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:34,290
kid and they want to get their kid in 
martial arts.

2104
01:21:34,291 --> 01:21:36,180
I got involved in martial arts at an 
early age,

2105
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,553
but I got involved in striking,
but it was because there was no Jujitsu 

2106
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:42,150
when I was a kid.
But if I,

2107
01:21:42,151 --> 01:21:45,660
if I had a child that was interested in 
competing,

2108
01:21:45,661 --> 01:21:49,200
I would get them involved in Jujitsu 
because you might get your arm broken,

2109
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:51,180
but guess what?
The fucking put you in a cast.

2110
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:52,430
He'll heal up.
You learn to tap.

2111
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,620
Next time you know you'll,
you'll,

2112
01:21:53,621 --> 01:21:55,780
you'll get John Broken falling out of a 
tree.

2113
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:58,750
When did you start?
How old were you when you started?

2114
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:59,840
I got sick.
Well,

2115
01:21:59,841 --> 01:22:04,250
I started my first,
I took karate when I was 14 but I really

2116
01:22:04,251 --> 01:22:05,084
got serious when I was 15 I took it a 
little Kung Fu when I was younger than 

2117
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:08,534
that,
but I didn't get serious until I was a 

2118
01:22:09,951 --> 01:22:10,784
soft my right before,
like from the summer of my right before 

2119
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:17,620
when freshmen to sophomore,
so forth.

2120
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,473
There's something team during that time.
Was there some reason why you got 

2121
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:23,600
interested or why?
I've been interested because I was small

2122
01:22:23,601 --> 01:22:25,880
and I didn't want to get picked on.
There was definitely that.

2123
01:22:25,881 --> 01:22:28,880
But the big thing was,
it was just straight luck.

2124
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,120
I was a baseball fan and went to a red 
sox game at Fenway Park.

2125
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:34,820
I was walking home and I was,
so I was walking home,

2126
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:37,310
me and a buddy of mine,
we're going to the,

2127
01:22:37,311 --> 01:22:38,210
you know the,
the t,

2128
01:22:38,211 --> 01:22:39,044
the public transport,
there's a dry line cause it was the 

2129
01:22:40,731 --> 01:22:42,410
baseball game we could let out.

2130
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,753
So we were walked by this taekwondo 
school and I walked upstairs and it was 

2131
01:22:47,561 --> 01:22:52,310
as long staircase up to the Jay Hahn Kim
Taekwondo Institute.

2132
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:55,190
And as I was walking up,
just by luck,

2133
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:59,390
there's a guy named John Lee who was the
national taekwondo champion,

2134
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,224
national light heavyweight champion.
And he was training for the World Cup 

2135
01:23:03,170 --> 01:23:06,460
and he was in just peak for the World 
Cup.

2136
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,290
And I,
as I got up to the top of stairs,

2137
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:10,000
this,
I heard this sound,

2138
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:13,870
this lump,
and then there's like chink,

2139
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,550
like these chains,
like chains,

2140
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:18,250
like shake womp,
Chink.

2141
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,260
And I was like,
what the fuck is that sound?

2142
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:21,094
And as I got to the top of the stairs,
there was this era you had to take off 

2143
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:25,720
your shoes and you had to walk in.
You could watch these guys train.

2144
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:31,200
And John Lee was kicking the bag and he 
was doing this spinning back kick on the

2145
01:23:31,781 --> 01:23:36,781
bag and bending this 100 pound bag in 
half and sending it flying.

2146
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:40,280
And I remember thinking,
I got to learn to do that.

2147
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:43,480
I couldn't believe anybody could hit 
anybody that hard.

2148
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:45,280
I'd never seen anything like that in my 
life.

2149
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:47,610
Did jump,
did the guy that you were with the buddy

2150
01:23:47,611 --> 01:23:48,990
that you were with,
did he go up there too?

2151
01:23:48,991 --> 01:23:50,870
And he quit?
He started for a little,

2152
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:52,230
but he,
he was a buddy of mine,

2153
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,940
still a buddy of mine actually.
We're still friends.

2154
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:58,050
Um,
W we watched it together and uh,

2155
01:23:58,230 --> 01:24:00,780
I became obsessed.
I joined right away.

2156
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:02,820
Interesting.
I joined right away that that guy,

2157
01:24:02,821 --> 01:24:05,100
because that Guy John lead became like 
a,

2158
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:07,380
a big influence on me.
He taught me a lot.

2159
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:08,800
He was living in Boston.
Yeah,

2160
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:09,770
yeah,
yeah.

2161
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,610
And uh,
he wound up having,

2162
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:14,220
um,
a lot of drug problems himself.

2163
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:16,890
Um,
it was crazy to watch as well,

2164
01:24:16,891 --> 01:24:20,340
but that guy taught me,
he took me under his wing.

2165
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,020
It was crazy.
You know,

2166
01:24:22,021 --> 01:24:22,854
just a total random turn of events.
Me Walking up those stairs at the exact 

2167
01:24:27,841 --> 01:24:29,550
right time that that guy was there.
I mean,

2168
01:24:29,551 --> 01:24:30,810
who knows,
I could have walked up the stairs.

2169
01:24:30,811 --> 01:24:31,890
It could have been a children's class.

2170
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:32,803
Right,
exactly.

2171
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:35,743
Exactly.

2172
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:37,283
The up there and the baddest 
motherfucker in the country was killing 

2173
01:24:40,181 --> 01:24:42,730
this bag test.
It was just perfect timing.

2174
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,800
Yeah.
And it life's a lot like that.

2175
01:24:44,801 --> 01:24:45,191
I mean,
you know,

2176
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:47,110
there's this shift that happens and you 
think,

2177
01:24:47,111 --> 01:24:47,944
wow,
that's,

2178
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,290
you know,
whether it's happenstance,

2179
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:51,760
coincidence,
or it's supposed to be that way,

2180
01:24:51,761 --> 01:24:52,594
who knows?
But,

2181
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:53,501
uh,
yeah,

2182
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:54,520
I don't know why

2183
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:58,640
you could add all this meaning to it and
you might be right.

2184
01:24:58,641 --> 01:25:00,260
Or you might,
might just be guessing.

2185
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:01,094
But to me it was a,
a gigantic moment and decision in my 

2186
01:25:05,211 --> 01:25:06,044
life to go up those stairs and to see 
that guy doing that changed my whole 

2187
01:25:08,751 --> 01:25:09,584
life because that became my life.
And from 15 to 21 that's what I did 

2188
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,100
every day in my life.
I mean,

2189
01:25:16,101 --> 01:25:17,540
I trained every day

2190
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:18,533
and that's what you got to find.
You're gonna find whatever's going to 

2191
01:25:19,621 --> 01:25:20,454
spark it.
You see parents do that all the time 

2192
01:25:22,081 --> 01:25:22,914
with their kids.
So,

2193
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:25,050
you know,
I want him a kid to be a baseball player

2194
01:25:25,051 --> 01:25:27,540
and they just push and push and push.
Instead of saying,

2195
01:25:27,541 --> 01:25:28,041
look,
I want,

2196
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:28,874
I want to expose these kids to various 
things and see if they spark the find 

2197
01:25:32,111 --> 01:25:33,630
themselves,
find the thing.

2198
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:36,570
And because it's got to be part of,
it's got to be internal.

2199
01:25:36,571 --> 01:25:37,620
You can't,
I mean,

2200
01:25:37,621 --> 01:25:39,780
you can for a period of time and then,
then you know,

2201
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:40,561
that's it.
It's not,

2202
01:25:40,561 --> 01:25:41,394
it's only gonna go so far.
But if you could find that thing like 

2203
01:25:42,841 --> 01:25:43,674
you did,
but that sparks something and the kid 

2204
01:25:45,571 --> 01:25:46,381
realizes,
you know,

2205
01:25:46,381 --> 01:25:48,510
I could become really good at this and 
we're in.

2206
01:25:48,511 --> 01:25:51,030
I enjoy it and it sets me apart.
It makes me different.

2207
01:25:51,031 --> 01:25:53,190
It makes me special.
And God bless,

2208
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:54,090
you know,
if you can,

2209
01:25:54,091 --> 01:25:55,920
if you can do that with your kids,
you're halfway home.

2210
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:59,220
I didn't even know if I could be good at
it because I didn't have any talent.

2211
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:03,670
I mean it wasn't like I walked up there 
and all of a sudden I was the right,

2212
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:04,880
you know,
I walked up there,

2213
01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:06,050
I was like,
Holy Shit.

2214
01:26:06,051 --> 01:26:06,884
I was surrounded by black belts who were
kicking people's heads off and I was 

2215
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:10,640
like,
this is insane.

2216
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,290
It was just,
to me it was,

2217
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:16,130
it was so terrifying,
but it was also in a good way.

2218
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:20,240
It was very much like a cult because it 
was in a good way.

2219
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:23,960
Like they didn't take advantage of you,
but you had to bow.

2220
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:24,883
You had to say yes sir.
There was some intense discipline and 

2221
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:31,790
you got to see some intense consequences
to fucking up.

2222
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:34,130
Cause I got to see a lot of guys get 
knocked out.

2223
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:34,911
You know,
I,

2224
01:26:34,911 --> 01:26:35,744
I saw a lot of guys get knocked out and 
tournaments and start guys getting 

2225
01:26:37,491 --> 01:26:42,140
knocked out in practice and there was 
also the belt system.

2226
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:43,123
The belt system,
I think in martial arts is very 

2227
01:26:46,041 --> 01:26:46,874
important for kids because like you 
started out as a white belt and you get 

2228
01:26:49,851 --> 01:26:52,520
that blue belt like you tie,
like here's a perfect example,

2229
01:26:52,521 --> 01:26:56,780
Anthony Bourdain's 58 fucking years old.
He just got his blue belt and he told me

2230
01:26:56,781 --> 01:26:58,400
it was the happiest he's ever been in 
his life.

2231
01:26:58,770 --> 01:26:59,603
More,
more important than anything other than 

2232
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:02,870
the birth of his child.
It was like,

2233
01:27:02,871 --> 01:27:04,940
to him it was like,
I fucking did it.

2234
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:08,000
And here's a guy who like used to be a 
heroin addict,

2235
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,940
smoked cigarettes,
just drinking all the time,

2236
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:15,970
was at a terrible lifestyle.
His wife who's obsessed with Jujitsu got

2237
01:27:16,161 --> 01:27:16,994
him to take a Jujitsu class and then all
of a sudden for whatever reason that 

2238
01:27:20,211 --> 01:27:21,200
switch goes,
I look at them,

2239
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:23,060
they're very,
he is getting his blue belt.

2240
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:26,480
And for people who don't understand that
is a very difficult to accomplishment.

2241
01:27:26,481 --> 01:27:30,020
To get your Booba is not easy to do.
It's very hard to do.

2242
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,960
And that if you can get your blue belt 
and he's like,

2243
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:34,160
I'll never get my black belt.
I'm like,

2244
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:35,390
bullshit.
Listen to me,

2245
01:27:35,391 --> 01:27:37,430
man.
If you can get your fucking blue belt,

2246
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:40,070
you can get your black belt.
It just keep going.

2247
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:40,990
Yeah.

2248
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:41,711
But it said,
it said,

2249
01:27:41,711 --> 01:27:43,930
like you said for kids,
it's that success,

2250
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,720
which runs counter to sort of the 
concept of team sports right now anyway.

2251
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:48,490
Right.
Kids.

2252
01:27:48,490 --> 01:27:51,020
So you give them that opportunity.
And uh,

2253
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:53,140
I've got again,
the middle boy who's,

2254
01:27:53,141 --> 01:27:53,974
who's,
uh,

2255
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:55,360
you know,
six and right now he's,

2256
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:58,450
he's that kid who likes to know what,
what the,

2257
01:27:58,451 --> 01:27:59,284
uh,
what the parameters are and likes to 

2258
01:28:00,551 --> 01:28:03,250
know that there's a system in place.
Right.

2259
01:28:03,251 --> 01:28:05,320
So he's the kid have all been,
he's very aggressive too,

2260
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:06,580
is,
he's very physical kid.

2261
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:07,414
So that's,
we've been looking at what's out there 

2262
01:28:08,921 --> 01:28:11,590
and where we live to see where would be 
a good spot for him.

2263
01:28:11,591 --> 01:28:14,200
But,
but he's definitely the kid of the three

2264
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,810
that he looks at that and he goes,
I get it.

2265
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:19,300
I can go from here to here to here to 
here,

2266
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:20,163
and that's a good thing.

2267
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:21,510
Well,
if you want to get them in more involved

2268
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,393
in martial arts,
we'll talk afterwards and I'll find out 

2269
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:25,000
what,
what's near you.

2270
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:26,620
That would be good.
That would find out what's good.

2271
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:28,720
But I can't recommend that enough for 
kids,

2272
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:29,703
for young boys,
especially because it takes away this 

2273
01:28:31,811 --> 01:28:32,644
fear of engaging with other kids.
It takes her with his fear of getting 

2274
01:28:36,731 --> 01:28:38,500
your ass kicked,
a fear of the unknown.

2275
01:28:38,501 --> 01:28:39,334
If you don't know how to fight,
you wind up getting involved in fights 

2276
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:42,963
accidentally because your posture,
you stick your fucking chest up and you 

2277
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:51,840
don't know the consequences are so alien
to you that you,

2278
01:28:51,841 --> 01:28:56,841
you wind up talking too loud or trying 
to bluff someone and you can fuck up and

2279
01:28:58,001 --> 01:28:59,260
run into the wrong dude.

2280
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:00,580
It in a way,
it's like a,

2281
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:01,473
it's like a concealed carry permits.
If you don't know what the hell you're 

2282
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:05,214
doing and if you don't have the 
discipline and if you're not constantly 

2283
01:29:07,591 --> 01:29:09,360
training.
Yeah,

2284
01:29:09,361 --> 01:29:11,280
there's,
there's a serious potential for fuck up.

2285
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:14,460
What's a serious potential for fuckup 
and that's my own issue.

2286
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:17,880
My personal issue with all these fucking
states that are,

2287
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:20,000
that are there open carry states.
Yeah.

2288
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,510
Well you don't even have to have any 
training.

2289
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,410
Like I think it's kind of crazy.
I think first of all,

2290
01:29:25,411 --> 01:29:26,244
I'm a big sport is second amendment.
I have guns so let me get that out of 

2291
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:28,944
the way.
But I think you should learn how to 

2292
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:32,580
fucking use a gun before you should get 
one.

2293
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:33,570
Yeah.
How can you,

2294
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,960
how come I can get a car?
I have to go through all this shit.

2295
01:29:36,961 --> 01:29:39,060
I have to learn how to drive.
I have to fill out forms.

2296
01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:42,000
I have to learn the rules.
I can just go get a gun.

2297
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,250
Yeah.
All you do is just not be a criminal and

2298
01:29:44,251 --> 01:29:46,460
you can get a gun.
That seems crazy to me.

2299
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,470
The training aspect of it.
Is it anybody who's serious about,

2300
01:29:49,471 --> 01:29:50,570
about weapons?
Anybody who's,

2301
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:52,710
who's dealt with them,
anybody who's had to carry them for,

2302
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:53,573
for a livelihood,
you gained a real appreciation for how 

2303
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,850
quickly things had south and,
and,

2304
01:29:58,851 --> 01:29:59,684
and,
and,

2305
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:00,743
and,
and the idea that I agree with you on a 

2306
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:03,201
percent.
Uh,

2307
01:30:03,201 --> 01:30:05,070
and I'm a huge supporter of the second 
amendment.

2308
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,630
Um,
and,

2309
01:30:06,631 --> 01:30:07,200
uh,
I got,

2310
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,070
uh,
you know,

2311
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:11,130
they go walk in safe and happy to have 
it,

2312
01:30:11,131 --> 01:30:11,964
but at the same time,
if I just can't get behind the idea of 

2313
01:30:14,821 --> 01:30:16,770
people going out and,
and not training,

2314
01:30:16,771 --> 01:30:20,670
not practicing.
And that's a large,

2315
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:21,810
not a large,
but I,

2316
01:30:21,811 --> 01:30:23,490
and I,
you know what I'm about to speculate,

2317
01:30:23,491 --> 01:30:25,090
so I probably shouldn't,
but there's a,

2318
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:28,920
there's a decent percentage of people 
who go out and they buy it and then they

2319
01:30:28,921 --> 01:30:29,860
put it in a lockbox.

2320
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,550
Hopefully they put it in a lockbox and 
then that's it,

2321
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:33,810
you know,
and then they,

2322
01:30:33,811 --> 01:30:35,400
you know,
maybe sometime they're gonna need it and

2323
01:30:35,401 --> 01:30:36,840
they don't know what the fuck they're 
doing.

2324
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:38,063
So it's the,
it's the training and you just have to 

2325
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:41,730
be constant repetition,
constant repetition.

2326
01:30:41,731 --> 01:30:44,250
Cause if you do need to use it,
everything else shuts down.

2327
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,310
And you know,
haul your little,

2328
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,440
you know,
controls go away and you're,

2329
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:51,550
you're depending on your big muscle mass
and,

2330
01:30:51,551 --> 01:30:53,640
and,
and repetition and muscle memory.

2331
01:30:53,641 --> 01:30:56,040
And if you haven't been practicing,
you're fucked.

2332
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:57,750
You might,
you might as well turn it on yourself.

2333
01:30:57,790 --> 01:31:00,320
And that's the same thing with fighting.
It's the same thing with everything.

2334
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:01,700
When you're,
when you're nervous,

2335
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:03,163
all the training comes out and that's 
what you're going to fall back on your 

2336
01:31:05,811 --> 01:31:07,550
training.
If you train incorrectly,

2337
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,610
you're going to perform incorrectly 
under pressure.

2338
01:31:10,611 --> 01:31:13,280
And that's the same with firearms is 
same with everything.

2339
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:15,600
Yeah.
If you don't prepare the,

2340
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:18,410
but see we have this country where 
everybody's like,

2341
01:31:18,411 --> 01:31:20,820
you tried to take well goons,
which will do well.

2342
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:25,030
No one's trying to take away your guns,
but I think it should.

2343
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,700
The idea of firearms owning a firearm 
being a right,

2344
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:33,350
I think it should be a privilege.
And I think much like driving a car is a

2345
01:31:33,351 --> 01:31:34,184
privilege.
I don't think you should keep anyone 

2346
01:31:35,541 --> 01:31:39,170
from doing it just arbitrarily,
but I think you should prove that.

2347
01:31:39,171 --> 01:31:41,990
You know what the fuck you're doing 
before you put other people in danger.

2348
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,090
That's what we have with cars by the 
way.

2349
01:31:44,091 --> 01:31:45,420
It's speedboats too.
Yeah.

2350
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:46,950
We got not a lake.
He gets up

2351
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:47,993
gasol who's never gotten behind the 
wheel of a boat before and all of a 

2352
01:31:49,891 --> 01:31:51,720
sudden he's doing 30 down the lake and 
you think,

2353
01:31:51,721 --> 01:31:52,400
what the fuck?

2354
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,040
Some rich dick head of buys a fucking 
one of those cigarette.

2355
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:55,903
Yeah,
exactly.

2356
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:56,913
You ever seen those videos of those 
cigarette butts that go a hundred miles 

2357
01:31:59,060 --> 01:31:59,893
an hour?
People flip 'em up in the air and 

2358
01:32:00,491 --> 01:32:01,310
everybody dies.

2359
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:02,001
Yeah,
I like it.

2360
01:32:02,001 --> 01:32:03,140
Like A,
like a fountain boat.

2361
01:32:03,141 --> 01:32:05,210
You know,
those things are insane and yeah,

2362
01:32:05,450 --> 01:32:06,560
you'll get some,
you know,

2363
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:09,140
get somebody or buy one and then they'll
show up on the lake.

2364
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,153
Next thing you know,
you know your kids out water skiing and 

2365
01:32:11,841 --> 01:32:12,270
you're,
you're,

2366
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:13,790
you know,
fearing for their life because,

2367
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:15,440
yeah.
But so point taken,

2368
01:32:15,441 --> 01:32:17,210
I think,
you know,

2369
01:32:17,550 --> 01:32:21,410
uh,
I don't know how you would tie in the,

2370
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:26,030
uh,
the purchase with the training with the,

2371
01:32:26,031 --> 01:32:27,180
uh,
showing approving,

2372
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:28,600
the ability.
Uh,

2373
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:31,490
I don't know how you'd do that,
but it's extremely difficult.

2374
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:32,343
Yeah.

2375
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:35,600
Psychological evaluation as the bad idea
either.

2376
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,840
I don't think it's a bad idea to ask 
people a bunch of questions,

2377
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:39,943
you know what I mean?
Just try to get someone who's a 

2378
01:32:41,241 --> 01:32:43,490
qualified individual to,
uh,

2379
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:44,870
talk to this person.
I mean,

2380
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:45,953
you're not going to,
you're going to have some fucking 

2381
01:32:47,211 --> 01:32:48,860
psychopathic going to be able to trick 
you,

2382
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:52,670
but that's just,
you're going to weed out some folks that

2383
01:32:52,671 --> 01:32:55,070
could be a problem and people have a 
problem with that.

2384
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:56,660
Well,
you're trying to take where it guns.

2385
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:59,900
One of these liberals get involved in 
this process and they say,

2386
01:32:59,901 --> 01:33:01,790
no one's qualified.
That's what they want.

2387
01:33:01,791 --> 01:33:03,460
Don't you understand?
Don't you worry

2388
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:06,100
burry slope.
It's a slippery slope.

2389
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:08,560
Do one thing and it's all gonna fall to 
hell.

2390
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:09,600
Yeah.
No,

2391
01:33:09,601 --> 01:33:10,530
I,
it,

2392
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:11,620
that's a hipaa issue.
How do you,

2393
01:33:11,621 --> 01:33:13,250
as Addie is,
share medical information?

2394
01:33:13,251 --> 01:33:16,000
How of you share is share information 
from a [inaudible] office and,

2395
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,830
um,
I,

2396
01:33:17,831 --> 01:33:18,441
you know,
it's,

2397
01:33:18,441 --> 01:33:19,274
again,

2398
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:21,980
never had medical attention.
Yeah.

2399
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:25,040
It's definitely like a nuts out there 
that haven't had anybody look at them.

2400
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:25,750
Right?
No,

2401
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:26,251
I haven't.
You know,

2402
01:33:26,251 --> 01:33:27,084
one of the other things,
I've never woken up in the morning and 

2403
01:33:28,411 --> 01:33:29,730
thought to myself,
good God,

2404
01:33:29,731 --> 01:33:33,570
I gotta get myself another 45 or I've 
got to get myself in another ar 15.

2405
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,620
I gotta have it now.
I,

2406
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:36,753
I have no problems with waiting and I've
got teams in my company that do nothing 

2407
01:33:39,511 --> 01:33:41,250
but,
but due diligence on people,

2408
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:41,791
right?
And No,

2409
01:33:41,791 --> 01:33:43,120
it's not,
not for purposes of,

2410
01:33:43,121 --> 01:33:45,460
of a weapons permit,
but um,

2411
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:46,613
I know how difficult that process is 
even for relatively straightforward due 

2412
01:33:49,831 --> 01:33:50,664
diligence.
And so the idea that I have no problems 

2413
01:33:53,521 --> 01:33:56,260
with expanded background checks and I 
noticed that a lot of people,

2414
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,690
you know,
right now a screaming and saying,

2415
01:33:58,590 --> 01:33:59,810
oh my God,
the drug,

2416
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,390
and again,
I'm a huge supporter of the,

2417
01:34:02,391 --> 01:34:04,350
of the Second Amendment,
NRA member,

2418
01:34:04,351 --> 01:34:05,490
all the rest of that shit.
And I,

2419
01:34:05,491 --> 01:34:07,170
and I and I,
God bless it.

2420
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:10,680
But at the same time,
we have to be able to,

2421
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:12,060
uh,
find those,

2422
01:34:12,061 --> 01:34:13,920
those,
those ideas,

2423
01:34:13,921 --> 01:34:17,850
those answers or at least talk about 
them without immediately started to pull

2424
01:34:17,851 --> 01:34:19,620
the pins on the grenades and thrown in 
each other.

2425
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:20,461
And that's,
you know,

2426
01:34:20,461 --> 01:34:23,300
going back to the earlier conversation 
about politics and the yachts and so,

2427
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:24,900
you know,
it probably no other,

2428
01:34:24,901 --> 01:34:27,930
well there's other emotive issues,
but certainly with the second amendment,

2429
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:29,063
you know,
the idea that you're going to spend a 

2430
01:34:30,001 --> 01:34:31,620
little bit more time on a background 
check,

2431
01:34:31,650 --> 01:34:32,483
you know,
if you got to rush into the store and 

2432
01:34:33,481 --> 01:34:34,111
buy your,
your,

2433
01:34:34,111 --> 01:34:34,944
your,
your handgun and get out of there as 

2434
01:34:36,181 --> 01:34:38,450
quick as possible.
What's up?

2435
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:40,050
I mean,
just take,

2436
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:41,310
yeah,
you can take a little time.

2437
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:43,140
Um,
so otherwise to kill yourself.

2438
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,400
Yeah.
So I dunno.

2439
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:45,720
It's um,
but again,

2440
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:47,490
nobody,
nobody exists in the center anymore.

2441
01:34:47,491 --> 01:34:49,620
Nobody exists in the middle.
So.

2442
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:50,643
Exactly.
Even if guy who supports a second 

2443
01:34:52,211 --> 01:34:55,180
amendment saying something like that 
could be problematic and you're going to

2444
01:34:55,181 --> 01:34:55,920
get criticized.

2445
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,680
Oh my God,
if I run for governor out in Idaho,

2446
01:34:57,681 --> 01:34:58,160
I'm sure someone's

2447
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,470
going to pull that one up.
Did you see what he said?

2448
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:03,080
And you're thinking,
how is that a problem?

2449
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:03,943
Yeah.
I just don't understand how anybody 

2450
01:35:04,701 --> 01:35:07,010
could be against background checks.
Right.

2451
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:11,000
It doesn't make any sense to me.
How could someone be against training?

2452
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:13,820
How could somebody be against firearm 
education?

2453
01:35:13,821 --> 01:35:15,260
How could somebody be against that?
Yeah.

2454
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:17,270
Well when you,
when you get a hunting license,

2455
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,690
you have to go through a hunter's safety
course.

2456
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,150
And the hunter safety course is pretty 
extensive.

2457
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:23,984
It takes a long time.
There's a lot of questions you have to 

2458
01:35:25,971 --> 01:35:26,804
answer.
You have to know why the fuck is that 

2459
01:35:28,941 --> 01:35:31,250
the case with hunting,
but it's not the case with a gun.

2460
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:32,690
Yeah.
What about self defense?

2461
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:33,524
So it shouldn't,
you have to have all these junior have 

2462
01:35:36,441 --> 01:35:39,170
to have an understanding of how to use a
safety.

2463
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:43,410
Shouldn't yet have the variations in 
training for uh,

2464
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:46,040
or classroom work for concealed carry 
permits.

2465
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:47,240
You know,
you got,

2466
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:50,450
you got great training programs and then
you got less than,

2467
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:52,250
less than great.
Significantly less than.

2468
01:35:52,251 --> 01:35:53,084
Great.
And you're talking about carrying a 

2469
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:58,520
weapon out in public.
And that is an enormous responsibility.

2470
01:35:58,570 --> 01:36:00,140
And,
and I think it's important,

2471
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:01,160
you know,
and,

2472
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:03,410
and I think it's,
it's just,

2473
01:36:03,411 --> 01:36:05,540
it falls in line with what we're talking
about.

2474
01:36:05,541 --> 01:36:06,374
How do you have,
but how do you get to that point if as 

2475
01:36:08,481 --> 01:36:09,314
soon as you raise that issue again,
people start throwing hand grenades 

2476
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:13,040
agile and you'd think,
well,

2477
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:13,731
wait a minute,
I'm just,

2478
01:36:13,731 --> 01:36:16,400
I'm raising this as a possibility.
Maybe there's something,

2479
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:19,010
some other tact here that we can take 
and not,

2480
01:36:19,011 --> 01:36:20,120
you know,
not just the second amendment,

2481
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,740
every,
every fucking thing out there,

2482
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:22,710
right.
Uh,

2483
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:24,410
Obamacare,
I'll let you know.

2484
01:36:24,411 --> 01:36:26,030
I,
you know,

2485
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,130
it's,
it's either all this or all that.

2486
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,910
Instead of saying it the early outset,
we,

2487
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:31,310
you know,
what would have been wrong with saying,

2488
01:36:31,330 --> 01:36:31,761
hey,
you know,

2489
01:36:31,761 --> 01:36:32,211
let,
let's,

2490
01:36:32,211 --> 01:36:33,560
let's do preexisting conditions.

2491
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:37,430
Let's keep kids on their health plans 
for their parents a little bit longer.

2492
01:36:37,431 --> 01:36:40,400
And then let's try to figure out where 
else we can make improvements.

2493
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:44,450
But it's all one thing or the other.
I think one of the things about owning a

2494
01:36:44,451 --> 01:36:45,590
gun,
and this is,

2495
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,990
it's very important to anybody that has 
a gun.

2496
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:52,100
You should want to be educated in proper
firearm safety.

2497
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,320
If you have a gun,
you should want this.

2498
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:58,280
So training shouldn't be something that 
you would fight.

2499
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:01,280
It should be something that everybody 
would embrace.

2500
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,233
If you have a gun,
you understand the dangers and the 

2501
01:37:03,531 --> 01:37:04,364
consequences of having a gun.
You also understand that you need 

2502
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:12,140
someone to show you how to do it right.
If you don't have anybody who puts it in

2503
01:37:12,141 --> 01:37:13,130
your head,
you know,

2504
01:37:13,131 --> 01:37:16,430
always have your finger off the trigger.
This is the safety.

2505
01:37:16,431 --> 01:37:19,310
No it no it when it's pushed back,
you know,

2506
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:20,510
you're,
you're here.

2507
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:22,300
When it's pushed forward,
you're ready to rock.

2508
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:25,010
Like no,
these things understand these things.

2509
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:26,390
Well I think it's,
it's,

2510
01:37:26,410 --> 01:37:28,670
um,
yeah,

2511
01:37:28,671 --> 01:37:30,980
if you live out west and not,
again,

2512
01:37:30,981 --> 01:37:31,760
not dead,
dead.

2513
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,470
I mean cause down south you could argue 
to say anything,

2514
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:34,333
mountain culture and everything else,
but there's a certain appreciation for 

2515
01:37:38,690 --> 01:37:39,523
both the use of weapons and the 
responsibility involved because there 

2516
01:37:42,741 --> 01:37:45,260
are so many people out there that a hunt
and there are so many.

2517
01:37:45,261 --> 01:37:46,094
I mean,
I the,

2518
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:47,181
you know,
I,

2519
01:37:47,181 --> 01:37:49,340
I would suspect that,
uh,

2520
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:51,200
I mean everybody I know that that owns a
weapon,

2521
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:53,480
uh,
goes to the range they,

2522
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:54,343
uh,
or they're out practicing their target 

2523
01:37:55,861 --> 01:37:56,150
hunting

2524
01:37:56,150 --> 01:37:57,330
and you know,
before hunting season,

2525
01:37:57,331 --> 01:38:00,690
Shari shows up there.
They're working the problem.

2526
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:02,910
Uh,
I don't know that that's true in,

2527
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:04,740
in a major urban centers.
I don't know.

2528
01:38:04,741 --> 01:38:05,760
I mean,
I have no idea,

2529
01:38:05,761 --> 01:38:06,930
but,
um,

2530
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,900
there's a few people,
I mean,

2531
01:38:08,901 --> 01:38:11,780
there's ranges that you can go to where,
you know,

2532
01:38:11,781 --> 01:38:13,610
I mean,
you can take firearms lessons.

2533
01:38:13,611 --> 01:38:17,030
The thing is that it's not mandatory.
And then there's also the variants,

2534
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:20,840
the different rules that you have in 
different states.

2535
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:23,450
Like Arizona is an open carry state.
Right?

2536
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,310
Right.
So you just go to the store,

2537
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:27,080
you're not a felon,
you get a gun,

2538
01:38:27,081 --> 01:38:28,370
just walk around with a gun.
Yeah.

2539
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:29,240
You have it.
Got It.

2540
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:30,380
Yep.
Okay.

2541
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,650
You don't have to know shit.
And it causes problems.

2542
01:38:32,651 --> 01:38:33,484
I mean,
depending on who you're talking to in 

2543
01:38:35,211 --> 01:38:35,981
law enforcement,
it's,

2544
01:38:35,981 --> 01:38:36,450
you know,
there's,

2545
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:38,230
there's a lot of folks in law 
enforcement,

2546
01:38:38,231 --> 01:38:39,430
they look at it and go,
yeah,

2547
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:41,590
I mean,
it's not,

2548
01:38:41,591 --> 01:38:44,600
it's not what they would prefer.
It's not up to them to,

2549
01:38:44,601 --> 01:38:46,540
to make that call.
But at the same time,

2550
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:47,280
I,
you know,

2551
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,113
I look at it and then I think if,
if there's one issue that probably 

2552
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:56,650
summarizes,
um,

2553
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:57,830
the,
the,

2554
01:38:58,150 --> 01:38:58,990
the,
the sort of,

2555
01:38:58,991 --> 01:39:01,450
the emotive nature of,
of politics nowadays,

2556
01:39:01,451 --> 01:39:02,860
it's probably,
it's probably this one.

2557
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:03,940
I mean,
I think that's a big,

2558
01:39:03,941 --> 01:39:06,490
we've gotten past the whole gay marriage
thing and you know,

2559
01:39:06,491 --> 01:39:09,280
the abortion thing always flares up and 
always will probably,

2560
01:39:09,281 --> 01:39:10,210
but,
but the,

2561
01:39:10,211 --> 01:39:12,000
the second amendment,
you know,

2562
01:39:12,001 --> 01:39:13,600
and so you do think,
okay,

2563
01:39:13,601 --> 01:39:14,434
well how do we can set the default 
position for the administration is 

2564
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,170
always,
you know,

2565
01:39:17,170 --> 01:39:18,700
um,
it's always,

2566
01:39:18,701 --> 01:39:19,630
you know,
blowing it up.

2567
01:39:19,690 --> 01:39:21,640
Right?
And so,

2568
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:23,740
you know,
they misplayed as well.

2569
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:28,270
I think if there was more compromised,
more discussion in the center where they

2570
01:39:28,271 --> 01:39:30,580
had this quietly outside of the,
you know,

2571
01:39:30,581 --> 01:39:30,921
the,
the,

2572
01:39:30,921 --> 01:39:31,754
the realm of media,
but they just seem to be unable to do 

2573
01:39:33,851 --> 01:39:35,200
it.
So every time there's an incident,

2574
01:39:35,201 --> 01:39:38,470
the first thing you see is somebody from
the administration up behind the podium,

2575
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:39,583
you know,
making statements and talking about gun 

2576
01:39:41,411 --> 01:39:43,720
control.
And that fuels the other side that fuels

2577
01:39:43,721 --> 01:39:46,540
the right where the side with thinks 
they're just trying to take away all our

2578
01:39:46,541 --> 01:39:47,374
weapons.
And because they see this and there's 

2579
01:39:49,661 --> 01:39:50,920
nothing reason to going on

2580
01:39:50,950 --> 01:39:51,783
right here.
There's no reasonable consideration of 

2581
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:56,810
the pros and cons of this issue.
And no one's,

2582
01:39:57,610 --> 01:40:00,450
there's no one's stepping in the middle,
right?

2583
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:04,550
It's like the FBI and apple dispute.
That's what it's like.

2584
01:40:04,610 --> 01:40:06,950
It's not the same thing.
You got it all on one side.

2585
01:40:06,951 --> 01:40:09,200
You've got all on the other.
And the reality is,

2586
01:40:09,201 --> 01:40:10,034
you know what,
we could have found a solution here 

2587
01:40:11,091 --> 01:40:12,640
somewhere if,
uh,

2588
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:13,890
you know,
if,

2589
01:40:13,891 --> 01:40:15,990
if,
if we'd been at,

2590
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:17,450
and I,
although who knows,

2591
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:18,313
I don't know.
Apple seems to be inclined to draw a 

2592
01:40:20,751 --> 01:40:22,010
line under this particular,

2593
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:25,270
she was there trying to get into that 
guy's phone.

2594
01:40:25,271 --> 01:40:27,880
The killer who killed those people in 
San Bernardino.

2595
01:40:27,881 --> 01:40:30,810
They want to get into his phone and uh,
they,

2596
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:34,060
FBI wants apple to engineer some sort of
a back door.

2597
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:34,861
Well,
here's,

2598
01:40:34,861 --> 01:40:36,480
here's what it is.
So this guy,

2599
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:38,190
uh,
side for had,

2600
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:39,660
he had,
uh,

2601
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:41,670
three phones,
at least that we know about two of them,

2602
01:40:41,671 --> 01:40:43,320
he destroyed,
he completely destroyed him.

2603
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:44,190
And,
and the,

2604
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:45,023
the bureau has been looking,
they take nothing recoverable off those 

2605
01:40:47,101 --> 01:40:49,320
systems and they've asked a lot of 
people for assistance.

2606
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,630
So they had the other phone,
which was in his truck,

2607
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:53,800
which is his work phone.
It was belonged to the county.

2608
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:57,580
And so they went to the county bureau,
did they went to the county,

2609
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:58,473
uh,
when they pulled this phone out of the 

2610
01:40:59,351 --> 01:41:00,184
truck and they said,
we need to get the information off of 

2611
01:41:04,121 --> 01:41:05,290
this thing because you know what,
a phone,

2612
01:41:05,291 --> 01:41:07,240
a phone nowadays everybody keeps 
everything on their phone.

2613
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:09,040
Right.
And so they,

2614
01:41:09,041 --> 01:41:09,874
uh,
they got the support they pulled and 

2615
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:12,064
they found out that he had shut off the 
function that a uploads data to the 

2616
01:41:15,491 --> 01:41:16,660
cloud,
uh,

2617
01:41:16,661 --> 01:41:17,494
in October.

2618
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,740
And so they were able to get everything 
up to October,

2619
01:41:20,770 --> 01:41:23,170
but then that's two full months prior to
the attack.

2620
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:24,341
So they said,
okay,

2621
01:41:24,341 --> 01:41:25,880
well we can't get this.
And the,

2622
01:41:25,881 --> 01:41:26,651
and the,
the,

2623
01:41:26,651 --> 01:41:27,760
the phone has,
you know,

2624
01:41:27,761 --> 01:41:28,594
this default position where if you try 
the password 10 times and it erases 

2625
01:41:31,451 --> 01:41:33,610
everything.
So they took the phone,

2626
01:41:33,611 --> 01:41:34,444
the bureau took the f,
the phone to apple and this was well 

2627
01:41:36,101 --> 01:41:39,760
before they had to go get a court order.
Well before it became public knowledge.

2628
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:40,923
They actually went and had numerous 
quiet conversations with apple and they 

2629
01:41:43,451 --> 01:41:45,760
went to apple and they said,
literally said,

2630
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:48,850
you can take the phone,
keep it on your campus,

2631
01:41:48,851 --> 01:41:50,380
keeping in your facility,
put it in a,

2632
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:51,160
we don't,
you know,

2633
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:51,993
wherever put it in your lap.
All we're asking is for you to create a 

2634
01:41:55,301 --> 01:41:58,720
systems information file that you can 
force on that phone,

2635
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:03,430
that one phone and pull the tech,
which then allows you to brute force the

2636
01:42:03,431 --> 01:42:08,431
password and get the texts off of there,
get the data off of there and exists and

2637
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:11,620
then you can destroy the sif,
the systems information file.

2638
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:14,770
You can keep the phone.
We don't even need to touch it.

2639
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:15,550
We can,
you know,

2640
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:18,280
whatever you just give us the shit 
that's on the phone.

2641
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:21,760
An apple has has been helpful in the 
past.

2642
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:22,863
They've been,
they've been helpful in the past and 

2643
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:26,103
this time for some,
for whatever motivation they've decided 

2644
01:42:29,861 --> 01:42:31,570
to draw a line in the sand and say,
no,

2645
01:42:31,571 --> 01:42:32,404
we're not going to do this.
And it's not as if they haven't been 

2646
01:42:35,471 --> 01:42:37,030
helpful.
And there's an ongoing dialogue.

2647
01:42:37,031 --> 01:42:37,864
And so it's,
it's disingenuous to say that apple is 

2648
01:42:40,061 --> 01:42:40,930
now,
you know,

2649
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:42,633
uh,
the bulwark for privacy because they 

2650
01:42:44,801 --> 01:42:47,020
have been helpful in the past and they 
will continue to be helpful,

2651
01:42:47,021 --> 01:42:49,690
I suppose in their own way.
But for this particular phone,

2652
01:42:49,691 --> 01:42:52,060
for this one time where they could have 
held onto the phone,

2653
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:53,133
created that Sif destroyed the sif at,
at that moment that they've pulled the 

2654
01:42:56,651 --> 01:42:57,160
texts off.

2655
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,210
So that's it.
That's done.

2656
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:02,230
So now what Tim Cook is saying is not 
that it's creating a back door.

2657
01:43:02,231 --> 01:43:04,570
He's not saying that he's saying it 
creates a precedent,

2658
01:43:05,290 --> 01:43:10,190
but the precedent was already that if 
the bureau goes through the,

2659
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:11,293
the,
the process the congress has set and 

2660
01:43:14,351 --> 01:43:18,370
then goes through that process and gets 
a court order and the court,

2661
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,690
then it looks at it and says,
yes,

2662
01:43:19,691 --> 01:43:22,480
you've got probable cause you've got 
reasonable concern here.

2663
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:24,160
Uh,
they provide a court order,

2664
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:27,250
then they go and they make this request 
for assistance.

2665
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,850
You're also talking about a dead guy 
talking about a guy who shot 14 people,

2666
01:43:30,851 --> 01:43:32,770
14 people killed,
14 people.

2667
01:43:32,970 --> 01:43:34,690
Um,
I've heard all sorts of things.

2668
01:43:34,691 --> 01:43:37,330
I've heard people say to me and I,
and again,

2669
01:43:37,331 --> 01:43:38,470
I understand,
don't get me wrong,

2670
01:43:38,471 --> 01:43:42,370
because I understand fully the 
importance of finding the right place on

2671
01:43:42,371 --> 01:43:44,980
the pendulum for Security and privacy.

2672
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:46,390
I get that.
I get that.

2673
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:48,410
And that's an important discussion.
I'm not saying it's not,

2674
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:49,253
it's,
you should always have that 

2675
01:43:49,511 --> 01:43:50,344
conversation,
but part of that is then during the 

2676
01:43:52,461 --> 01:43:56,270
course of that conversation,
Congress and the courts,

2677
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:58,490
they make those decisions.
Where does that pendulum,

2678
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:59,703
you know,
settle between security and privacy and 

2679
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:02,660
that settles here.
Okay,

2680
01:44:02,661 --> 01:44:03,494
fine.
Then that's what the bureau or whomever 

2681
01:44:04,431 --> 01:44:05,264
has to go through to get approval to get
some assistance and that's where it 

2682
01:44:08,690 --> 01:44:09,523
stands.
But you know to say that because now 

2683
01:44:12,981 --> 01:44:13,814
you've got all,
all three branches of government have 

2684
01:44:14,601 --> 01:44:15,141
said,
yeah,

2685
01:44:15,141 --> 01:44:18,770
we think that really we could use this 
information off of this phone.

2686
01:44:19,070 --> 01:44:20,360
But I've heard everybody say,
well,

2687
01:44:20,370 --> 01:44:22,250
why don't they just do the rest of the 
investigation?

2688
01:44:22,251 --> 01:44:23,084
Well,
of course they fucking done the rest of 

2689
01:44:23,721 --> 01:44:24,554
the investigation.
They done all the other investigative 

2690
01:44:26,151 --> 01:44:26,984
steps.
So what are you saying in a situation 

2691
01:44:28,341 --> 01:44:29,160
like this?

2692
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:29,993
Uh,
you just want them to do 80% of the 

2693
01:44:30,951 --> 01:44:32,330
investigation.
And if you've got,

2694
01:44:32,331 --> 01:44:34,340
you know,
that you've got material on here who,

2695
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:37,640
which may lead to operational activity,
uh,

2696
01:44:37,641 --> 01:44:38,474
in,
in finding other people who were 

2697
01:44:39,141 --> 01:44:44,060
involved or finding people overseas who 
were in somehow assisting or whatever it

2698
01:44:44,061 --> 01:44:45,350
may be.
If you're saying,

2699
01:44:45,351 --> 01:44:46,041
well,
just now,

2700
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:47,480
you know what,
for the sake of this,

2701
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:50,540
we're not asking for a back door.
They're asking for that,

2702
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:51,150
that,
that,

2703
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:53,480
that one phone.
And that's where this whole thing is,

2704
01:44:53,481 --> 01:44:56,240
is really headed south and it's become 
this idea that,

2705
01:44:56,570 --> 01:44:58,100
you know,
which is erroneous.

2706
01:44:58,101 --> 01:45:00,380
But I understand what Tim Cook is saying
about the precedent,

2707
01:45:00,410 --> 01:45:01,970
although not really,
because again,

2708
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,250
they've done this before.
For some reason for this one,

2709
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:06,770
they're drawing a line.
So anyway,

2710
01:45:06,771 --> 01:45:07,470
I,
but I've heard that,

2711
01:45:07,470 --> 01:45:10,550
why don't they just do the rest of the 
investigation and skip this part?

2712
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:13,630
What I don't,
I don't,

2713
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:16,160
I don't follow that logic train.
And then the other people,

2714
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:16,911
other people were saying,
well,

2715
01:45:16,911 --> 01:45:18,350
why don't they just get it off the 
metadata?

2716
01:45:18,830 --> 01:45:19,663
And that's another one of those things 
where people never believed what the 

2717
01:45:21,711 --> 01:45:22,544
government was saying.
But the metro fucking data was numbers 

2718
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:26,780
and volume.
That was it.

2719
01:45:26,810 --> 01:45:28,400
There was no information to be had 
there.

2720
01:45:28,401 --> 01:45:29,234
You could sit in a fucking room full of 
metadata and not know what the hell 

2721
01:45:31,371 --> 01:45:32,204
you're looking at.
You had to go through the court process 

2722
01:45:33,411 --> 01:45:35,960
to then get that particular numbers 
information.

2723
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:36,893
So here's my question,
because this is what came up with the 

2724
01:45:39,570 --> 01:45:40,403
Edward Snowden thing.
They were saying that the government is 

2725
01:45:41,191 --> 01:45:42,024
monitoring all cell phone data 
constantly and they can get information 

2726
01:45:45,811 --> 01:45:46,291
all the time.
Well,

2727
01:45:46,291 --> 01:45:48,900
this kind of proves that not to be true.
Yeah.

2728
01:45:48,901 --> 01:45:50,310
But people don't look at it that way.
They don't,

2729
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:53,610
they don't.
They don't make that leap back and say,

2730
01:45:53,730 --> 01:45:55,950
oh,
well maybe that was a fallacy.

2731
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:56,480
Yeah,
sure.

2732
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,640
The metadata was sweeping up all that,
that those numbers and volume.

2733
01:45:59,910 --> 01:46:02,340
But again,
it's not enough to what end.

2734
01:46:02,341 --> 01:46:03,420
Yeah.
And so some people would say,

2735
01:46:03,421 --> 01:46:04,960
once they realized what it was actually 
doing,

2736
01:46:04,961 --> 01:46:05,551
then they say,
wow,

2737
01:46:05,551 --> 01:46:06,384
but that's so what?
So they're just collecting the shit in 

2738
01:46:08,491 --> 01:46:09,720
the basement.
It's not doing any good.

2739
01:46:09,721 --> 01:46:11,580
So they shouldn't even collect that 
information.

2740
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:12,563
So what Edward Snowden was talking about
is essentially just when it pertains to 

2741
01:46:16,231 --> 01:46:17,700
email,
I mean,

2742
01:46:17,790 --> 01:46:18,623
he said they're collecting all this 
information that the NSA is collecting 

2743
01:46:22,261 --> 01:46:26,130
all this information in regards to cell 
phone data and the recording.

2744
01:46:26,131 --> 01:46:27,600
Every phone call,
the recording,

2745
01:46:27,601 --> 01:46:29,250
all these text messages.
Yeah.

2746
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:30,600
Um,
so is that not true?

2747
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:31,141
Well,
no,

2748
01:46:31,141 --> 01:46:32,520
I frankly,
I'm here.

2749
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:34,860
Of course nobody's going to,
again,

2750
01:46:34,861 --> 01:46:35,730
this is a very emotive,
right?

2751
01:46:35,731 --> 01:46:37,200
So there's all these people out there,
they're going to say,

2752
01:46:37,201 --> 01:46:38,034
fuck you.
You don't know what the fuck are you 

2753
01:46:38,631 --> 01:46:39,464
talking about?

2754
01:46:40,950 --> 01:46:42,450
Yeah,
no aluminum.

2755
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,740
There is nobody right now unless you're 
a terrorist,

2756
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:47,430
a terrorist suspect or a criminal.
This,

2757
01:46:47,431 --> 01:46:49,500
nobody in the government hooks up.
Fuck you.

2758
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:50,100
I'm here to tell

2759
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,980
you your Dick pics or safe ladies and 
Gentlemen,

2760
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:52,883
Dick Pics are absolutely Jina pictures 
that had been floating around all your 

2761
01:46:56,311 --> 01:46:57,890
boyfriend.
Okay.

2762
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:58,953
Goes a secure,
nobody's going to route those around 

2763
01:47:00,691 --> 01:47:01,524
that you would rat you out for those as 
a piece of shit and unamerican in the 

2764
01:47:04,411 --> 01:47:05,920
first place.
Yeah.

2765
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:08,490
So that's a,
that's a really eyeopening thing though,

2766
01:47:08,491 --> 01:47:09,324
because this case kind of throws that 
all into jeopardy cause everybody was 

2767
01:47:11,641 --> 01:47:12,690
like concerned.
Like,

2768
01:47:12,691 --> 01:47:13,524
Hey,
the government can check in on all your 

2769
01:47:15,031 --> 01:47:15,864
phone calls and all your text messages.
Well this would clearly be a case where 

2770
01:47:19,171 --> 01:47:20,850
they would want to do that.
So they don't,

2771
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,033
they can't do it here without the,
did the judge granting this order and 

2772
01:47:25,310 --> 01:47:27,360
what,
so tell me why did,

2773
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:30,360
there was a recent court order right 
there ruled in favor of apple.

2774
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:32,750
They did.
And that was in New York.

2775
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:34,130
And that was an interesting case as 
well.

2776
01:47:34,131 --> 01:47:37,060
And that's probably going to set a 
precedent for maybe,

2777
01:47:37,130 --> 01:47:40,970
maybe we'll see cause it's a little bit 
different what the judge essentially was

2778
01:47:40,971 --> 01:47:42,690
saying in that case and it involved,
uh,

2779
01:47:42,730 --> 01:47:43,690
uh,
uh,

2780
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:46,250
narco trafficking investigation that was
going on.

2781
01:47:46,850 --> 01:47:49,520
And by the way,
this isn't just for terrorism.

2782
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:51,770
Imagine what if this was for pedophilia?
I mean,

2783
01:47:51,771 --> 01:47:54,800
I imagine a large Pete Ophelia ring,
what are you going to say?

2784
01:47:54,830 --> 01:47:55,663
No,
we don't want to catch those fucking 

2785
01:47:56,781 --> 01:48:00,440
Douche bags that are involved in that 
because privacy,

2786
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:03,020
you know,
I understand the privacy aspect,

2787
01:48:03,021 --> 01:48:05,540
but each case has to be looked at on its
merits and if,

2788
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:07,400
and if you say through the courts and 
through the,

2789
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:08,383
through the congress that these are the 
hoops that the bureau has to jump 

2790
01:48:10,611 --> 01:48:12,200
through and they jumped through those 
hoops,

2791
01:48:12,201 --> 01:48:13,670
then then what?

2792
01:48:13,670 --> 01:48:16,250
Then it's up to each company to decide 
whether they want to support it or not.

2793
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:17,540
I don't know that,
that seems strange.

2794
01:48:17,541 --> 01:48:18,374
But anyway,
the point being is that the one in New 

2795
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:20,720
York,
the judge essentially was saying,

2796
01:48:20,721 --> 01:48:21,590
well look,
you want us,

2797
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:22,693
you want the courts to make a decision 
on this for something that Congress 

2798
01:48:24,801 --> 01:48:27,770
should really make a decision on this.
And so in a way,

2799
01:48:27,950 --> 01:48:30,890
his decision was a pushback against the 
concept of that,

2800
01:48:30,891 --> 01:48:31,724
that the,
uh,

2801
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:34,670
the bureau was basing this on,
which is a very old law.

2802
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:35,920
And so the judge is saying,
look,

2803
01:48:35,921 --> 01:48:38,840
you relying on a law that's a couple of 
hundred years old or whatever.

2804
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:40,013
Um,
maybe instead we should be having this 

2805
01:48:42,111 --> 01:48:45,830
looked at it through the legislature.
And so there was a,

2806
01:48:45,831 --> 01:48:48,350
there was an interesting sort of 
legality to his,

2807
01:48:48,351 --> 01:48:53,010
his response to this,
but it definitely a favorite apple and,

2808
01:48:53,030 --> 01:48:53,930
and,
and and sure.

2809
01:48:53,930 --> 01:48:55,340
That's great.
Let's legislate it.

2810
01:48:55,370 --> 01:48:58,660
But do you think that just maybe,
um,

2811
01:48:59,930 --> 01:49:03,050
there are times when from an operational
perspective,

2812
01:49:03,350 --> 01:49:06,710
you might want to move a little bit 
quicker than asking Congress to take up,

2813
01:49:06,730 --> 01:49:07,563
uh,
an issue and debate it and then maybe 

2814
01:49:09,591 --> 01:49:10,424
eventually come up.
So maybe occasionally you're going to 

2815
01:49:11,841 --> 01:49:15,560
have moments like this,
the San Bernardino shooting where you've

2816
01:49:15,561 --> 01:49:20,030
got a phone in your hand and all you're 
asking apple to do is take possession of

2817
01:49:20,031 --> 01:49:21,440
it.
And who knows?

2818
01:49:21,441 --> 01:49:22,274
Maybe their problem is they're worried 
that if they create the sif at that 

2819
01:49:24,381 --> 01:49:26,150
moment,
someone's going to steal it from them,

2820
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:27,613
one of their employees.
So maybe they've got an internal 

2821
01:49:28,611 --> 01:49:30,590
security issue because then they can 
destroy it.

2822
01:49:30,591 --> 01:49:32,230
The bureau's not asking for that phone 
back then,

2823
01:49:32,231 --> 01:49:33,064
not asking for that Sif.
They're not asking them for to do it on 

2824
01:49:35,031 --> 01:49:36,320
any other,
what is a sif,

2825
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:38,090
but he says systems,
information flour.

2826
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:40,940
So you just force it onto that phone.
And that bypasses the,

2827
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:45,100
essentially what the court has done is 
made a very conservative,

2828
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:48,070
conservative interpretation of

2829
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:49,190
the law.
Right.

2830
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:51,340
And basically saying that this needs to 
blame.

2831
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:53,260
This is a place where the courts should 
be deciding,

2832
01:49:53,261 --> 01:49:54,750
we believe you should be taking this to 
Congress.

2833
01:49:54,751 --> 01:49:55,584
And so therefore I don't see why you're 
legislating or asking us to make a 

2834
01:49:58,181 --> 01:49:59,470
decision on this.
See,

2835
01:49:59,471 --> 01:50:01,750
I understand the common person's 
perspective.

2836
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:04,560
They don't trust the government,
the whole Edward Snowden thing.

2837
01:50:04,561 --> 01:50:07,180
And the next thing.
Everybody's freaking out about that.

2838
01:50:07,181 --> 01:50:08,890
And then they look at this saying,
well,

2839
01:50:08,891 --> 01:50:11,230
this is the slippery slope.
Again,

2840
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:15,100
this is the thing that if the government
has access to your phone play,

2841
01:50:15,101 --> 01:50:15,934
we're talking about a fucking mass 
murderer and a guy who's already dead 

2842
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:21,730
and we have one phone.
Yeah,

2843
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:22,720
yeah.
It's,

2844
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,140
and,
and,

2845
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:27,190
and so to say that you're going to only 
do a limited investigation,

2846
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,353
even though you know you've got 
potential information and a way to do 

2847
01:50:30,911 --> 01:50:32,650
it,
like on an individual basis,

2848
01:50:32,651 --> 01:50:34,060
just one phone only.

2849
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:35,740
That's what the cover,
that's what they're asking.

2850
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:38,740
But can it be that you could never grant
ag?

2851
01:50:38,770 --> 01:50:39,750
I mean it's,
it's,

2852
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,510
it doesn't make any sense to me.
Well,

2853
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:45,100
it wouldn't want to get access to that 
guy's fucking data.

2854
01:50:45,130 --> 01:50:45,963
And here's where,
and I think going back to that 

2855
01:50:47,051 --> 01:50:47,884
overriding theme,
which is nothing resides in the center 

2856
01:50:49,901 --> 01:50:50,740
anymore.
Uh,

2857
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:51,603
you're right.
We do have to be concerned about 

2858
01:50:52,661 --> 01:50:53,650
privacy.
And I agree.

2859
01:50:53,651 --> 01:50:54,790
Okay,
what happens if you don't?

2860
01:50:54,791 --> 01:50:56,800
Big Brother.
But there are times when,

2861
01:50:56,830 --> 01:50:57,663
you know,
operational concerns probably override 

2862
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:05,160
at least an element of this where you 
have common pr or a reason to,

2863
01:51:05,621 --> 01:51:08,320
people can exist in the comment in the 
middle and say,

2864
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:09,760
yeah,
on this occasion,

2865
01:51:09,761 --> 01:51:10,594
because you've gone through all these,
these orders and because we've set up 

2866
01:51:12,701 --> 01:51:13,810
this protection now,
meaning,

2867
01:51:13,811 --> 01:51:15,060
you know,
apple holds onto it and it,

2868
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:17,290
but you know,
that's not the way it works.

2869
01:51:17,290 --> 01:51:20,860
And so therefore apple comes out and 
says there and then the misinformation,

2870
01:51:20,890 --> 01:51:21,723
oh,
they trying to create a backdoor to all 

2871
01:51:22,331 --> 01:51:23,500
our apple devices.
By the way,

2872
01:51:23,501 --> 01:51:26,170
what do you think apple does with their 
devices that they sell in China?

2873
01:51:26,510 --> 01:51:27,343
You think that Chinese government would 
allow apple if someone got a talk about 

2874
01:51:30,911 --> 01:51:31,744
this in the media,
do you think the Chinese government 

2875
01:51:32,501 --> 01:51:35,650
would allow apple to sell devices that 
they can't get into?

2876
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:37,020
I,
uh,

2877
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:38,480
we could ask apple,
well,

2878
01:51:38,510 --> 01:51:40,300
Ascap,
I'm sure it would be an issue,

2879
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:43,840
but I can speak from a friend that I 
have that worked at Google.

2880
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:47,740
They had a gigantic issue in China with 
Google because,

2881
01:51:47,741 --> 01:51:49,210
you know,
they have android phones.

2882
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:50,073
And that was,
that was a big part of the issue is the 

2883
01:51:51,281 --> 01:51:53,260
government wanted to have access to 
phones.

2884
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:56,020
They also want to have access to what 
you're searching.

2885
01:51:56,290 --> 01:51:58,450
They wanted to know what people are 
searching.

2886
01:51:58,451 --> 01:51:59,284
They wanted to limit google searches.
There's this gigantic issue they were 

2887
01:52:02,291 --> 01:52:03,670
having.
Then on top of that,

2888
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:05,160
Google,
uh,

2889
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:06,033
was having to deal with the fact that 
China was kind of ripping off their 

2890
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:10,660
system and creating their own version of
it.

2891
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:14,630
And is China,
is these tactics state sponsor of uh,

2892
01:52:14,950 --> 01:52:15,783
economic espionage and cyber crime and 
shit and counter fay openly support 

2893
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:22,534
counterfeit shit to the point where 
there's entire stores that have apple 

2894
01:52:25,331 --> 01:52:26,164
logos,
they sell apple products and none of it 

2895
01:52:27,851 --> 01:52:30,100
is legit.
All the computers are fake.

2896
01:52:30,101 --> 01:52:32,440
All the phones are fake.
All the laptops are fake.

2897
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:33,453
None of it is created by Apple.
It looks exactly like this shit right 

2898
01:52:36,161 --> 01:52:38,020
here.
And it's just all man,

2899
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:40,680
they don't have laws to stop that.
Now.

2900
01:52:40,690 --> 01:52:42,460
There's not a rule of law there.
Even though they'd been to,

2901
01:52:42,461 --> 01:52:43,720
they were talking about this for a 
while.

2902
01:52:43,721 --> 01:52:44,441
They've been saying,
oh,

2903
01:52:44,441 --> 01:52:45,274
you know,
it's a new,

2904
01:52:45,850 --> 01:52:46,160
and

2905
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,110
this is again,
this is why you're going back to that.

2906
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:49,610
You know,
everything goes back in circles.

2907
01:52:49,611 --> 01:52:51,440
But the idea that we need a leader right
now that's,

2908
01:52:51,441 --> 01:52:54,600
that's reasoned and pragmatic and smart 
and you know,

2909
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,390
clear eyed is,
is a look at.

2910
01:52:56,420 --> 01:53:01,420
You look at China and you look at a look
at their economy and their is is heading

2911
01:53:01,641 --> 01:53:04,700
south and if using ping their,
yeah,

2912
01:53:04,701 --> 01:53:09,701
their economy's not doing well,
their growth projections are way off.

2913
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:11,313
There's always been this belief that 
their numbers have been cooked in 

2914
01:53:13,731 --> 01:53:14,564
numerous ways.
A G that the head of China has been 

2915
01:53:17,271 --> 01:53:18,104
consolidating power.
He's been creating new security 

2916
01:53:19,491 --> 01:53:20,324
apparatus.
He's been hiding behind this 

2917
01:53:22,581 --> 01:53:25,040
anticorruption drive to some degree,
which is again,

2918
01:53:25,041 --> 01:53:27,360
part of is consolidation of power.
Um,

2919
01:53:27,890 --> 01:53:30,650
and this idea that Oh,
somehow this rule of law is coming up.

2920
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:35,680
Nobody actually believes that.
And they are continuing to be incredibly

2921
01:53:35,781 --> 01:53:38,180
aggressive in economic espionage.

2922
01:53:38,210 --> 01:53:39,380
I mean they're not the only ones that 
have these,

2923
01:53:39,381 --> 01:53:41,120
everybody acts in their own best 
interest.

2924
01:53:41,510 --> 01:53:44,300
But the,
the Chinese have,

2925
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:45,393
I dunno,
four dozen plus academic institutions 

2926
01:53:48,171 --> 01:53:49,700
that have funded by the Chinese 
military,

2927
01:53:49,701 --> 01:53:53,550
the PLA and have a responsibility for 
uh,

2928
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:55,310
economic espionage,
developing new,

2929
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:57,830
new new means of basically stealing 
shit.

2930
01:53:58,760 --> 01:53:59,593
They've got a couple dozen,
at least information warfare units that 

2931
01:54:02,091 --> 01:54:02,924
we've identified run by the PLA that are
specifically designed to hoover up 

2932
01:54:06,770 --> 01:54:09,470
intellectual property and research and 
development and all the rest of that,

2933
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:11,630
not just from us,
I mean from around the globe.

2934
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:14,780
And you know,
we,

2935
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:17,210
um,
so the idea,

2936
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:18,053
yes,
the idea that that we would do business 

2937
01:54:19,251 --> 01:54:20,540
there,
uh,

2938
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:22,610
and,
and believe somehow that the,

2939
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:23,473
uh,
the authorities there in China aren't 

2940
01:54:24,921 --> 01:54:25,754
going to have our shit.
They're not going to have whatever it 

2941
01:54:27,081 --> 01:54:27,914
may be.
A pharmaceutical company that sets up a 

2942
01:54:28,971 --> 01:54:30,880
facility out there isn't going to lose 
their R.

2943
01:54:30,881 --> 01:54:31,714
And.
D of course they are.

2944
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:32,563
Everybody knows anybody in a serious 
manner who is doing business out in 

2945
01:54:34,581 --> 01:54:35,414
China.
Knows as soon as you set foot in there 

2946
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:38,750
and you establish yourself,
you know,

2947
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:41,450
manufacturing or just a sales,
whatever it may be,

2948
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:44,240
your information becomes their 
information.

2949
01:54:44,241 --> 01:54:45,680
It just going to work that way.
So,

2950
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:47,920
well,
that's a problem too because our shit is

2951
01:54:47,921 --> 01:54:48,754
made over there.

2952
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:50,800
A lot of Shit's made over there,
including stuff from,

2953
01:54:50,801 --> 01:54:52,660
from Donald Trump.
Um,

2954
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:55,150
but who knows,
maybe he's going to bring it back to the

2955
01:54:55,151 --> 01:54:55,570
states.

2956
01:54:55,570 --> 01:54:58,060
Well,
I have a friend who works for the bureau

2957
01:54:58,061 --> 01:55:02,620
and he was explaining to me how Chinese 
espionage works in the United States and

2958
01:55:02,621 --> 01:55:03,454
how they catch people that a guy will 
come over here and live a completely 

2959
01:55:06,791 --> 01:55:10,720
normal life and won't look like there's 
anything going on with him whatsoever.

2960
01:55:10,721 --> 01:55:13,090
Family Guy,
no weapons,

2961
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:15,340
no crime,
no nothing.

2962
01:55:15,550 --> 01:55:16,383
Be Friends,
someone who works in some sort of an 

2963
01:55:18,311 --> 01:55:19,144
intellectual capacity,
whether it's for some sort of a 

2964
01:55:21,221 --> 01:55:22,054
corporation that makes computers or 
something that works for the United 

2965
01:55:24,370 --> 01:55:27,400
States government that the wwe and 
rocketry or whatever,

2966
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:28,533
they'd be friend that guy and then 
slowly make their way in to the point 

2967
01:55:32,921 --> 01:55:33,820
where they say,
listen,

2968
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:35,223
I know people that can pay you a lot of 
money for some of the information that 

2969
01:55:38,711 --> 01:55:39,730
you have.
And by the way,

2970
01:55:39,970 --> 01:55:41,530
this information is out there anyway.

2971
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:43,740
It wasn't information and it can be much
less.

2972
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:46,140
It oftentimes as much less threatening 
than that.

2973
01:55:46,141 --> 01:55:46,731
It's just like,
you know,

2974
01:55:46,731 --> 01:55:47,070
I,
you know,

2975
01:55:47,070 --> 01:55:47,910
I need,
you know,

2976
01:55:47,911 --> 01:55:48,744
maybe I could,
I could have you consult with me on a 

2977
01:55:49,801 --> 01:55:52,440
paper that I'm writing for a very 
legitimate organization.

2978
01:55:52,441 --> 01:55:53,274
I mean,
how do these,

2979
01:55:53,610 --> 01:55:56,870
a lot of these folks come over here and 
they start going to school and then they

2980
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,660
get a grad degree and then they get a 
job and then what do they want?

2981
01:56:00,661 --> 01:56:01,494
Well,
the Chinese would always want them to 

2982
01:56:01,711 --> 01:56:02,544
get another job and then they get in.
Eventually they end up at Northrop 

2983
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,360
Grumman or they end up at Lockheed or 
they end up,

2984
01:56:06,361 --> 01:56:07,470
but you know,
so it doesn't matter.

2985
01:56:07,471 --> 01:56:08,251
Dupont,
Dow,

2986
01:56:08,251 --> 01:56:10,860
wherever it is,
information is of interest to them.

2987
01:56:10,861 --> 01:56:12,630
The Chinese are a little bit different 
than,

2988
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:13,493
than we are.
We,

2989
01:56:13,590 --> 01:56:14,423
we tend to be very targeted,
very specific in our tasking and part 

2990
01:56:16,711 --> 01:56:19,320
because we're a smaller operation than 
they are.

2991
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:21,090
They devote a huge amount of resource to
this,

2992
01:56:21,091 --> 01:56:23,040
but they just hoover up whatever's out 
there.

2993
01:56:23,041 --> 01:56:25,920
And then they make a decision as an 
interesting or valuable to them or not.

2994
01:56:26,490 --> 01:56:27,750
And you know,
again,

2995
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:28,980
people will say,
well,

2996
01:56:28,981 --> 01:56:31,230
you know,
you can't be coy about this.

2997
01:56:31,231 --> 01:56:32,220
We do that too.
Well,

2998
01:56:32,221 --> 01:56:35,580
you better hope we fucking do it because
it's otherwise,

2999
01:56:35,581 --> 01:56:36,200
it's a,
uh,

3000
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:39,520
it's a hugely unlevel playing field.
It,

3001
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,820
we're sweet angels out in the field of 
murders,

3002
01:56:41,821 --> 01:56:42,870
criminals,
right?

3003
01:56:42,871 --> 01:56:43,950
And we'd,
all we're doing is,

3004
01:56:43,951 --> 01:56:44,370
you know,
yeah,

3005
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:45,203
we're all snow precious snowflakes.
I'll just try to get together and not a 

3006
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:48,653
not keep score.
This is where Hillary's email problem 

3007
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:53,380
becomes a real issue,
right?

3008
01:56:53,410 --> 01:56:54,243
Because she,
by doing this and this sort of in a 

3009
01:56:56,561 --> 01:56:58,090
roundabout way,
we're bringing it all back,

3010
01:56:58,270 --> 01:56:59,103
puts it in perspective why it's so 
dangerous that she had this unprotected 

3011
01:57:02,351 --> 01:57:03,184
email because by copy and pasting 
classified information or deciding 

3012
01:57:08,590 --> 01:57:11,650
through her own decision making process 
with the people that were with her,

3013
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:14,410
what's,
what's okay to copy and paste and what's

3014
01:57:14,411 --> 01:57:18,400
not okay to copy and paste and not 
whether or not you go by the established

3015
01:57:18,401 --> 01:57:19,234
protocols of top secret or not top 
secret clearance or whatever clearance 

3016
01:57:21,821 --> 01:57:22,654
level you have.

3017
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:23,810
You're handing that over.
And,

3018
01:57:23,811 --> 01:57:24,480
and,
and the,

3019
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,180
the interesting thing is they don't 
necessarily care.

3020
01:57:26,181 --> 01:57:26,990
I mean,
obviously they,

3021
01:57:26,990 --> 01:57:27,441
you know,
they,

3022
01:57:27,441 --> 01:57:29,280
it blows her skirt up to get top secret,
you know,

3023
01:57:29,370 --> 01:57:31,040
information,
but they'll take anything,

3024
01:57:31,041 --> 01:57:32,770
they'll take it all,
they'll take a,

3025
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:33,650
you know,
the daily,

3026
01:57:33,651 --> 01:57:34,484
you know,
dribble that goes on through her email 

3027
01:57:36,021 --> 01:57:36,854
and,
and just to gain a better understanding 

3028
01:57:38,391 --> 01:57:41,200
as to what makes a person tick or who 
are the people around her.

3029
01:57:41,201 --> 01:57:43,070
They're looking for potential targets.
And that's,

3030
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:44,570
that's part of it.
You're looking for,

3031
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:45,513
you know,
where is there a chink in the armor 

3032
01:57:46,581 --> 01:57:49,340
where there's an opportunity to,
uh,

3033
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:53,000
to get in to her organization?
Is there somebody on the periphery could

3034
01:57:53,001 --> 01:57:54,020
be a landscaper.
Hey,

3035
01:57:54,021 --> 01:57:55,220
I,
now I know who landscapes,

3036
01:57:55,270 --> 01:57:56,980
they're great.
You know,

3037
01:57:56,990 --> 01:57:59,000
it's like,
it's like you're targeting a company.

3038
01:57:59,100 --> 01:57:59,900
Well,
who are you going to target?

3039
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:00,733
You're not going to target the CEO.
You're going to target the cleaning 

3040
01:58:02,181 --> 01:58:03,014
service.
We're going to target the secretary and 

3041
01:58:04,521 --> 01:58:05,630
the caterer.
You know,

3042
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:07,130
you're,
and so,

3043
01:58:07,850 --> 01:58:08,420
yeah,
I,

3044
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:09,260
and again,
I,

3045
01:58:09,261 --> 01:58:10,520
you know,
I get it everybody,

3046
01:58:10,521 --> 01:58:11,600
you know,
it's like with Ben Gazi,

3047
01:58:11,601 --> 01:58:13,760
people roll their eyes all the private 
email server era.

3048
01:58:13,940 --> 01:58:14,773
But if you've been involved in this and 
you understand how aggressive it is out 

3049
01:58:16,911 --> 01:58:17,601
there,
you know,

3050
01:58:17,601 --> 01:58:18,201
and not,
again,

3051
01:58:18,201 --> 01:58:20,240
not just the Chinese or Russians that,
you know,

3052
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:21,740
everybody's,
everybody's added.

3053
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:23,360
Um,
that,

3054
01:58:24,710 --> 01:58:25,181
you know,
we,

3055
01:58:25,181 --> 01:58:26,850
we,
we need to understand that it was,

3056
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:27,561
it's,
it was,

3057
01:58:27,561 --> 01:58:29,090
uh,
it was a serious problem.

3058
01:58:29,091 --> 01:58:29,871
It was a breach.
And,

3059
01:58:29,871 --> 01:58:30,621
and,
and again,

3060
01:58:30,621 --> 01:58:32,330
going back to the same thing,
if it had been me,

3061
01:58:32,331 --> 01:58:34,100
yeah,
sure I would have been done up and all,

3062
01:58:34,101 --> 01:58:34,934
if it had been somebody else,
they would be backed up and probably 

3063
01:58:36,891 --> 01:58:37,460
done time.

3064
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:40,280
So it's a little,
it's a little discouraging.

3065
01:58:40,370 --> 01:58:41,203
That's kind of that it is something that
someone would go to jail for and yet 

3066
01:58:45,070 --> 01:58:46,840
mishandling classified information.
Yeah.

3067
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:48,150
I mean,
you can't series of facts.

3068
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:50,020
It's a very serious offense and it,
and in particular,

3069
01:58:50,021 --> 01:58:51,370
when you're,
when you're a senior official,

3070
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:52,121
yeah,
good God.

3071
01:58:52,121 --> 01:58:52,954
You know,
she's a very smart person and she 

3072
01:58:54,131 --> 01:58:54,880
shouldn't,
you know,

3073
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,980
so this idea that somehow she just 
didn't know or,

3074
01:58:56,981 --> 01:58:57,810
you know,
she was,

3075
01:58:57,810 --> 01:58:58,643
you know,
I was too busy or I don't know how by 

3076
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:01,690
blackberry works or whatever.
What a load of crap.

3077
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,250
Anyway.
Yeah.

3078
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:08,340
Well this whole,
this brings us back to this whole Edward

3079
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:09,060
Snowden thing.
What,

3080
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:09,893
what is,
what's your position on this and that 

3081
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:12,394
guy and what he did and sort of exposing
the fact that the NSA was involved in 

3082
01:59:15,641 --> 01:59:16,474
this wide scale,
this gigantic sort of information 

3083
01:59:21,881 --> 01:59:24,040
gathering process,
the hoovering up of,

3084
01:59:24,050 --> 01:59:25,680
of a metadata program.

3085
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:27,280
It's gathered me this stuff up.
Well,

3086
01:59:27,490 --> 01:59:28,151
first of all,
again,

3087
01:59:28,151 --> 01:59:28,571
I think,
you know,

3088
01:59:28,571 --> 01:59:29,404
everybody should have spent more time 
understanding what the actual technical 

3089
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:35,530
aspects of it work because he gets it 
though was problematic.

3090
01:59:35,531 --> 01:59:40,220
He was saying the people that worked 
with him were accessing the emails of ex

3091
01:59:40,221 --> 01:59:42,460
girlfriends and they were,
you know,

3092
01:59:42,461 --> 01:59:43,750
there were,
do I buying on,

3093
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:45,250
maybe that might've happened.
Well,

3094
01:59:45,370 --> 01:59:46,900
yeah,
it's a human system.

3095
01:59:46,901 --> 01:59:48,280
So yeah,
there's gonna be some fuck ups.

3096
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:50,080
There's no doubt about it.
So he has a problem.

3097
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:51,010
Well,
I mean,

3098
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:54,010
I don't know what the INS and outs of a 
NSA are,

3099
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:56,050
you know,
in terms of their protocols for,

3100
01:59:56,070 --> 01:59:56,770
you know,
uh,

3101
01:59:56,770 --> 01:59:59,780
protection firewalls on,
on systems at,

3102
01:59:59,850 --> 02:00:00,610
uh,
you know,

3103
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:03,370
it at government agencies tend to be,
if they're used properly,

3104
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:05,080
are pretty robust.
But at the same time,

3105
02:00:05,410 --> 02:00:07,030
you know,
any human system,

3106
02:00:07,031 --> 02:00:07,864
it's like,
it's like Tsa is someone going to be 

3107
02:00:08,891 --> 02:00:11,320
asleep at the wheel and somebody gets 
through with a shoe bomb?

3108
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:12,153
Well,
it could happen because the human 

3109
02:00:12,911 --> 02:00:15,580
system,
but where do I stand on it?

3110
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:17,320
And no surprise.
And you know,

3111
02:00:17,370 --> 02:00:18,460
um,
again,

3112
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:20,140
it's all based on what your experiences 
are.

3113
02:00:20,141 --> 02:00:20,974
And I'd get the fact that people 
consider him a hero or a whistle or 

3114
02:00:23,931 --> 02:00:25,810
whatever they want to call it.
Um,

3115
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:27,603
you know,
he's signed paperwork that said he was 

3116
02:00:29,711 --> 02:00:32,050
going to protect national security 
interests,

3117
02:00:32,051 --> 02:00:32,884
that he was going to properly protect 
the information that he was given 

3118
02:00:36,701 --> 02:00:40,720
responsibility for seeing.
And he didn't,

3119
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:43,360
he didn't do that.
And he also,

3120
02:00:43,361 --> 02:00:46,270
despite what people may want to believe,
um,

3121
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:48,213
he caused a lot of damage.
It's a tremendous amount of damage in 

3122
02:00:50,261 --> 02:00:53,830
terms of information that was released 
about the way that we do things here.

3123
02:00:54,070 --> 02:00:58,030
Uh,
sources and methods that were of extreme

3124
02:00:58,031 --> 02:01:00,880
interest to not just a terrorist 
organization,

3125
02:01:00,881 --> 02:01:03,490
but extreme interest to Russian 
interests,

3126
02:01:03,491 --> 02:01:05,080
extreme interest to Iranians.

3127
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:06,700
And it's weird that he's in Russia right
now.

3128
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:07,421
Yeah,
I know.

3129
02:01:07,421 --> 02:01:08,560
Go figure.
Huh?

3130
02:01:08,830 --> 02:01:10,030
Uh,
yeah.

3131
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:12,730
Uh,
so did he do any good?

3132
02:01:12,790 --> 02:01:14,260
I don't know.
Did he do any good?

3133
02:01:14,290 --> 02:01:14,770
Well,
you know,

3134
02:01:14,770 --> 02:01:15,603
having that conversation is always good,
but we can have that conversation 

3135
02:01:17,501 --> 02:01:20,650
without him doing what he did and um,
and,

3136
02:01:20,651 --> 02:01:21,484
and we should,
in part of that responsibility lays on 

3137
02:01:23,051 --> 02:01:24,040
a,
on a,

3138
02:01:24,041 --> 02:01:28,270
on an aggressive and inquisitive.
I'm constantly aware,

3139
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:29,433
um,
checks and balances that exist within 

3140
02:01:31,211 --> 02:01:32,044
government,
so the Intel Committee and then that 

3141
02:01:32,871 --> 02:01:34,990
would send it in until committee and,
and all these people that need,

3142
02:01:35,070 --> 02:01:37,840
they tend to play a game in Washington.
They know what the fuck's going on.

3143
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:40,070
Like with the interrogation or rendition
program,

3144
02:01:40,071 --> 02:01:42,230
these people were briefed,
they knew what the hell goes on.

3145
02:01:42,231 --> 02:01:43,910
But there's a political game in 
Washington where they,

3146
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:44,863
they get to express outrage when 
something becomes a political football 

3147
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:47,480
of course.

3148
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:48,950
So,
um,

3149
02:01:49,010 --> 02:01:51,740
but yeah,
so I did he do any good?

3150
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:53,193
Hey,
we're talking about it and that's 

3151
02:01:53,721 --> 02:01:54,380
important.
I,

3152
02:01:54,380 --> 02:01:55,011
I,
again,

3153
02:01:55,011 --> 02:01:56,540
I keep going back to that.
I'm not,

3154
02:01:57,110 --> 02:01:59,930
um,
I'm not an,

3155
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:01,730
what's the word?
I'm not unsympathetic.

3156
02:02:01,731 --> 02:02:03,560
Doesn't sound right.
I understand.

3157
02:02:03,561 --> 02:02:07,220
I appreciate the importance of finding 
the proper place on the pendulum,

3158
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:08,233
but I have probably an overriding 
appreciation for security because of 

3159
02:02:11,391 --> 02:02:12,224
what I did.
And I understand that other people have 

3160
02:02:13,521 --> 02:02:14,354
an overriding appreciation for privacy 
because they didn't have the same 

3161
02:02:17,061 --> 02:02:18,940
experiences that they've had,
different experiences.

3162
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:21,200
And so that's great.
I appreciate that.

3163
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:24,860
And all I'm saying is I look at it from,
from my perspective,

3164
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:26,043
uh,
I don't look at him as a hero 

3165
02:02:27,111 --> 02:02:29,320
whistleblower in any way.
Um,

3166
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:30,910
I,
you know,

3167
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:34,120
I signed same agreements and,
uh,

3168
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:37,370
I'm expected to live up to those just 
like anybody else who does.

3169
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:38,233
He didn't,
he found a way that he thought was 

3170
02:02:40,281 --> 02:02:45,080
appropriate to make his point.
I don't have no idea what goes on in his

3171
02:02:45,081 --> 02:02:46,490
head.
Um,

3172
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:50,290
I w I just would've thought it would've 
been nice if,

3173
02:02:50,291 --> 02:02:51,110
if,
uh,

3174
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:51,943
I dunno,
we've made the point in a way that also 

3175
02:02:53,421 --> 02:02:54,800
protected our national security

3176
02:02:54,970 --> 02:02:56,980
just a little bit better.
How could that be done though?

3177
02:02:57,250 --> 02:02:59,080
Well,
without exposing what he,

3178
02:02:59,390 --> 02:03:00,223
what exactly did he expose?
He exposed the fact that they were 

3179
02:03:02,501 --> 02:03:03,334
gathering up metadata and that,
but there's been people that have said 

3180
02:03:07,361 --> 02:03:08,440
that it was more than metadata.

3181
02:03:08,550 --> 02:03:09,110
Well,
there's eight.

3182
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:09,871
It talks about,
you know,

3183
02:03:09,871 --> 02:03:12,090
surveillance programs and here's his,
his,

3184
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:12,700
you know,
there's lots,

3185
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:14,450
there were lots of little bits and 
pieces because he,

3186
02:03:14,451 --> 02:03:15,284
he,
he,

3187
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:16,320
he,
uh,

3188
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:18,330
he misappropriated,
he stole a lot of,

3189
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:20,880
a lot of information.
That was then essentially,

3190
02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:23,400
if anybody thinks that,
that Edward Snowden was smarter than the

3191
02:03:23,401 --> 02:03:24,234
Chinese authorities or the Russians and 
that they didn't get a hold of 

3192
02:03:26,581 --> 02:03:27,414
everything and that somehow he just 
secreted that information with Glenn 

3193
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:31,373
Greenwald and a couple others are those 
who have interests that are completely 

3194
02:03:34,651 --> 02:03:37,530
against ours,
didn't get ahold of that information is,

3195
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:38,443
it's a pretty naive thought last time.
I don't believe that Edward Snowden is 

3196
02:03:41,851 --> 02:03:45,990
smarter than the PLA and the resources 
of the FSB and Russia.

3197
02:03:45,991 --> 02:03:47,760
I just,
maybe I'm wrong.

3198
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:52,320
Maybe he's like the lex luther of it.
I don't think so.

3199
02:03:52,650 --> 02:03:53,483
But uh,
as an example is the surveillance 

3200
02:03:56,041 --> 02:04:00,270
programs supposedly that we had against 
a European leaders.

3201
02:04:00,270 --> 02:04:03,930
Remember the outreach with Angela Merkel
and the fact that,

3202
02:04:03,931 --> 02:04:04,764
you know,
we're listening in on some of her 

3203
02:04:06,091 --> 02:04:08,460
conversations,
the ones that we would have access to,

3204
02:04:08,970 --> 02:04:10,590
uh,
oh my God,

3205
02:04:10,591 --> 02:04:11,730
really,
really,

3206
02:04:12,030 --> 02:04:12,863
because you know what they're doing.
They're listening in on the 

3207
02:04:13,801 --> 02:04:16,230
conversations of their allies and the,
I mean the French,

3208
02:04:16,231 --> 02:04:17,064
the former head of the dgse,
the French Intel service turned to the 

3209
02:04:19,650 --> 02:04:20,483
head of France at one point when the 
head of France was secretary blue and 

3210
02:04:22,961 --> 02:04:24,590
seek the Lord and how could we be doing 
this?

3211
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:29,190
And the former head of the Intel service
looked at them French guy and said,

3212
02:04:29,191 --> 02:04:32,220
are you fucking kidding me?
What do you think we do?

3213
02:04:32,221 --> 02:04:33,060
This is what we do.

3214
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:33,953
So this is just always what he's 
exposing is something that everybody 

3215
02:04:36,181 --> 02:04:38,490
knew.
So the mock outrage,

3216
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:39,050
you're saying it's like

3217
02:04:39,050 --> 02:04:39,771
walk out.
It was,

3218
02:04:39,771 --> 02:04:41,630
it was Kabuki theater in Europe for 
sure.

3219
02:04:41,631 --> 02:04:43,470
I mean all they asked mostly theater.
Yeah.

3220
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:44,900
I mean they,
the hand wringing and all the,

3221
02:04:44,901 --> 02:04:45,591
all the,
Oh,

3222
02:04:45,591 --> 02:04:48,800
I can't believe that they are Americans 
would be allies would be doing this.

3223
02:04:48,830 --> 02:04:50,930
So they kind of assumed that everybody 
was doing it already.

3224
02:04:50,931 --> 02:04:51,764
I guarantee you what was going on in the
back rooms was the Intel service 

3225
02:04:53,901 --> 02:04:55,000
directors were all,
you know,

3226
02:04:55,370 --> 02:04:57,310
sitting down.
And I would hope to think that our,

3227
02:04:57,370 --> 02:04:59,330
our director was looking at them and 
saying,

3228
02:04:59,331 --> 02:05:00,350
what the fuck?
You know?

3229
02:05:00,351 --> 02:05:01,370
And they were probably having a,
you know,

3230
02:05:01,371 --> 02:05:02,540
having a drink and saying,
yeah,

3231
02:05:02,541 --> 02:05:03,290
okay,
we get it.

3232
02:05:03,290 --> 02:05:04,410
We get to joke,
you know,

3233
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:05,253
everybody's doing this.
And so the idea that somehow we're the 

3234
02:05:08,781 --> 02:05:10,350
bad guy,
uh,

3235
02:05:10,370 --> 02:05:13,610
look to French Intel services,
incredibly aggressive as an example.

3236
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:15,223
And there had been numerous cases where 
they've targeted a u s corporations for 

3237
02:05:20,001 --> 02:05:22,940
economic espionage.
And the idea that somehow,

3238
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:27,470
you know,
people should be shocked that one nation

3239
02:05:27,471 --> 02:05:28,304
is,
is acting in its own self interest in 

3240
02:05:29,421 --> 02:05:31,190
listening to other nations.
Again,

3241
02:05:31,191 --> 02:05:34,430
same theory with economic espionage.
We better hope we're playing offense and

3242
02:05:34,431 --> 02:05:36,800
defense in the way the world actually 
works.

3243
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:40,040
It'd be great if we all held hands and 
whinging monkeys on Unicorns.

3244
02:05:40,041 --> 02:05:42,500
Fluid are acids and we could all sing 
songs together,

3245
02:05:42,501 --> 02:05:44,410
but it's not how the world works.
So we,

3246
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:46,520
you know,
anyway,

3247
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,920
so that's me disappearing down a rabbit 
hole.

3248
02:05:48,990 --> 02:05:49,823
But,
but this rabbit holes kind of important 

3249
02:05:51,031 --> 02:05:51,864
to talk about because you actually have 
some pretty deep knowledge about this 

3250
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:56,214
rabbit hole and this is some of the 
things that get speculated left and 

3251
02:05:58,921 --> 02:05:59,754
right and back and forth.
And either you'd take one side or the 

3252
02:06:01,261 --> 02:06:03,360
other and everybody argues about it.
I mean,

3253
02:06:03,361 --> 02:06:06,720
no one wants to government to have 
unchecked access to your emails,

3254
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:08,260
your phone that,
yeah.

3255
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:10,170
And that's what people are worried 
about.

3256
02:06:10,171 --> 02:06:11,004
Again,
that slippery slope that is headed 

3257
02:06:12,331 --> 02:06:13,164
towards that.
But what you're saying is that everyone 

3258
02:06:15,331 --> 02:06:17,340
is always spied on everybody's phone 
calls.

3259
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:18,323
They've always been involved in 
monitoring leaders whenever they could 

3260
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:23,730
and that it's not just,
it's standard,

3261
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:24,840
it's standard protocol.

3262
02:06:25,050 --> 02:06:28,710
It's every nation acts in its own best 
interest sometimes.

3263
02:06:28,711 --> 02:06:31,200
It seems like the u s is the only one 
that apologizes for it.

3264
02:06:31,470 --> 02:06:32,303
But if you,
if you did nothing else other than 

3265
02:06:33,811 --> 02:06:37,670
approach foreign policy from the 
perspective that every nation action his

3266
02:06:37,671 --> 02:06:38,504
own best interest,
we wouldn't get caught short as many 

3267
02:06:39,991 --> 02:06:41,550
times as we do.
Look at Putin.

3268
02:06:41,700 --> 02:06:43,920
I mean,
Putin absolutely is,

3269
02:06:43,921 --> 02:06:46,290
is,
he's an old school kgb guy.

3270
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:47,213
He's,
he's always regretted that the Soviet 

3271
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:51,180
Union fell apart.
He considers it a huge catastrophe.

3272
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:52,033
Uh,
probably the biggest catastrophe called 

3273
02:06:52,921 --> 02:06:56,820
it of the 20th century.
And he's been busy ever since.

3274
02:06:56,821 --> 02:06:58,620
Trying to figure out how to rebuild at 
least,

3275
02:06:58,621 --> 02:06:59,160
uh,
uh,

3276
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:01,080
influence,
if not territory.

3277
02:07:01,410 --> 02:07:03,360
And Eh,
2000,

3278
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:05,250
whenever it was five,
he made us a,

3279
02:07:05,251 --> 02:07:07,020
one of his first statements about how it
was a,

3280
02:07:07,021 --> 02:07:09,600
it was a horrible thing that the Soviet 
Union fell apart.

3281
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:11,430
And then a couple of years later,
three years later,

3282
02:07:11,431 --> 02:07:11,941
he,
he,

3283
02:07:11,941 --> 02:07:12,774
the troops rolled into Georgia and they 
still own territory and Georgia and 

3284
02:07:15,361 --> 02:07:17,140
people don't talk about that.
Uh,

3285
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:18,153
Kazia in South [inaudible],
they've still got a large numbers of 

3286
02:07:20,461 --> 02:07:21,780
Russian troops in there.
So he got that.

3287
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:23,610
He got Crimea.
Um,

3288
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:24,473
you know,
eastern Ukraine is for all intense 

3289
02:07:25,651 --> 02:07:27,720
purposes going to become part of Russian
territory.

3290
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:30,840
And he's always been the same way.
He says what he means.

3291
02:07:30,841 --> 02:07:34,290
He acts in Russia's best interest.
Chinese are the same way.

3292
02:07:34,291 --> 02:07:35,860
We always seem to,
to feel like that's,

3293
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:37,270
that's unusual.
I mean,

3294
02:07:37,271 --> 02:07:40,330
I remember times when we'd be engaged 
in,

3295
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:44,740
in some counter insurgency operation 
overseas and um,

3296
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:46,353
we'd address him up and we'd give them 
money and party hats and we train them 

3297
02:07:49,450 --> 02:07:50,950
and then they go out,
meaning the,

3298
02:07:50,951 --> 02:07:51,430
the,
uh,

3299
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:56,020
foreign service foreign military and 
they wouldn't act like we would write.

3300
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:58,090
There would be problems.
So there'd be,

3301
02:07:58,091 --> 02:08:00,340
um,
human rights abuses or whatever.

3302
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:02,140
And you know,
the Senate,

3303
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:03,250
the Intel Committee,
which say,

3304
02:08:03,251 --> 02:08:05,380
I can't believe this.
How come they're not well,

3305
02:08:05,381 --> 02:08:07,090
because they're a fucking different 
culture,

3306
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:09,780
just like you talked about earlier with 
the Middle East there.

3307
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:11,513
You can dress them up and give them 
money and training and they're always 

3308
02:08:13,751 --> 02:08:15,520
going to act differently.
It just the way the world.

3309
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:16,354
But we never seem to quite get that.
And it's sort of like this acting in 

3310
02:08:18,881 --> 02:08:21,280
your own best interest.
We always seem to be what we do it,

3311
02:08:21,281 --> 02:08:22,114
but we feel like it's unseemly.
Somehow every other nation out there is 

3312
02:08:24,881 --> 02:08:26,680
doing it.
Allies and others,

3313
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:27,330
everybody.

3314
02:08:27,330 --> 02:08:28,163
So is this a part of the problem with 
people getting access to information on 

3315
02:08:31,801 --> 02:08:34,110
how the world works?
As time goes on,

3316
02:08:34,111 --> 02:08:34,944
that information becomes more and more 
accessible and people get more and more 

3317
02:08:37,321 --> 02:08:41,400
upset about things that essentially have
always been like this?

3318
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:43,410
Is that what's going on?
Yeah,

3319
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:44,273
I mean,
I think it's an interesting way to put 

3320
02:08:44,971 --> 02:08:46,710
it,
but people have a problem with it,

3321
02:08:46,711 --> 02:08:49,740
but they don't offer up a solution or 
what,

3322
02:08:49,741 --> 02:08:50,060
I mean,
the,

3323
02:08:50,060 --> 02:08:50,440
the,
the,

3324
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:51,273
the,
the argument is always United States 

3325
02:08:52,321 --> 02:08:54,330
should do better.
We should be better.

3326
02:08:54,331 --> 02:08:57,180
We should inspire.
There are American citizens.

3327
02:08:57,181 --> 02:08:58,014
We shouldn't spy on foreign leaders.
We should be the shining beacon of 

3328
02:09:01,021 --> 02:09:04,890
democracy and of honor throughout the 
world.

3329
02:09:04,940 --> 02:09:05,320
But,
you know,

3330
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:06,670
that's a lovely idea.
And we try it.

3331
02:09:06,671 --> 02:09:08,510
And it's kind of going back to what I'd 
said earlier.

3332
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:09,471
I,
you know,

3333
02:09:09,471 --> 02:09:11,330
and people would disagree,
but I,

3334
02:09:11,331 --> 02:09:12,164
again,
I've spent a lot of time overseas 

3335
02:09:13,791 --> 02:09:18,410
dealing with these issues and we try,
right?

3336
02:09:18,411 --> 02:09:20,420
We don't always get it right,
but we try to do that.

3337
02:09:20,421 --> 02:09:21,830
We try to be that,
that you know,

3338
02:09:21,831 --> 02:09:25,010
that that bright beacon and we try to be
the right direction,

3339
02:09:25,250 --> 02:09:26,540
all those things.
And,

3340
02:09:26,710 --> 02:09:29,750
and sometimes it works and sometimes it 
doesn't.

3341
02:09:30,080 --> 02:09:32,060
Um,
we had,

3342
02:09:32,061 --> 02:09:32,894
uh,
I remember one time I had a guy in a 

3343
02:09:34,311 --> 02:09:35,810
foreign service,
a foreign military.

3344
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:38,180
We're sitting having a drink and,
uh,

3345
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:41,330
and they've been engaged in a long 
conflict.

3346
02:09:41,331 --> 02:09:43,250
And anyway,
this guy says,

3347
02:09:43,251 --> 02:09:44,360
Hey,
he says,

3348
02:09:44,361 --> 02:09:45,171
uh,
he says,

3349
02:09:45,171 --> 02:09:47,330
thank you for,
for bringing us democracy.

3350
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:49,040
And then he paused for a minute.
He says,

3351
02:09:49,041 --> 02:09:52,760
please don't do it again.
I always thought that was a great line.

3352
02:09:52,761 --> 02:09:53,594
I always thought,
yeah,

3353
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:55,520
I get what you're saying.
Um,

3354
02:09:55,670 --> 02:09:58,040
but yeah,
it's,

3355
02:09:58,650 --> 02:10:02,670
it's not that easy to bring democracy.
Democracy doesn't really work.

3356
02:10:02,870 --> 02:10:04,060
It doesn't really work.
And,

3357
02:10:04,061 --> 02:10:05,720
and you know what we,
so,

3358
02:10:05,721 --> 02:10:06,440
yeah.
So what do you do?

3359
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:09,020
You end up dealing with people that are 
unsavory end up dealing with,

3360
02:10:09,350 --> 02:10:10,550
with countries that,
you know,

3361
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:12,073
hey,
we'd love them to be more in step with 

3362
02:10:12,891 --> 02:10:14,870
us,
but it's just not the way,

3363
02:10:15,290 --> 02:10:16,250
it just not the way it works.

3364
02:10:17,510 --> 02:10:18,343
It seems incredibly confusing and I 
don't think anybody's ever offered up a 

3365
02:10:20,981 --> 02:10:21,814
reasonable scenario where you could take
places that I liked the Middle East and 

3366
02:10:24,791 --> 02:10:27,970
straighten it out like no one's offered,
like some sort of a step,

3367
02:10:28,510 --> 02:10:31,000
like a or a program.
Or you can say,

3368
02:10:31,001 --> 02:10:32,560
well,
here's where they are now.

3369
02:10:32,561 --> 02:10:34,840
Here's the rights violations,
here's the,

3370
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:39,950
the real problems they have with 
religious freedom and this is how we can

3371
02:10:39,951 --> 02:10:42,440
get them out of that.
And we can get them to a place where the

3372
02:10:42,441 --> 02:10:45,050
United States is right,
where people have much more freedom.

3373
02:10:45,051 --> 02:10:46,430
We know it.
States isn't free.

3374
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:50,090
Freedom is an illusion.
It's an illusion.

3375
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:51,870
We're not totally free.
No,

3376
02:10:51,871 --> 02:10:53,120
it's totally free.
There's no,

3377
02:10:53,140 --> 02:10:54,920
there's no total freedom.
But it's also,

3378
02:10:54,921 --> 02:10:55,754
uh,
it's also because of the way the world 

3379
02:10:57,501 --> 02:10:57,810
is.

3380
02:10:57,810 --> 02:10:58,860
Yeah.
I'm telling you,

3381
02:10:58,861 --> 02:11:00,720
I'm,
I'm here to die again.

3382
02:11:00,721 --> 02:11:02,250
I've,
I've been to a lot of places and,

3383
02:11:02,251 --> 02:11:03,810
and,
uh,

3384
02:11:03,990 --> 02:11:04,823
we won the lottery and I realize 
everybody's coming from different 

3385
02:11:07,291 --> 02:11:10,590
positions and you know,
places in life and,

3386
02:11:10,610 --> 02:11:12,270
and,
and you know,

3387
02:11:12,271 --> 02:11:14,370
it's pretty fucked up for a lot of 
people here sometimes.

3388
02:11:14,371 --> 02:11:18,060
And,
but this is a good place to be overall.

3389
02:11:18,150 --> 02:11:18,983
And there's still as the potential,
even though it may seem far off 

3390
02:11:22,141 --> 02:11:22,974
sometimes for some people,
but there's still the potential if you 

3391
02:11:24,511 --> 02:11:25,320
work hard,
you can,

3392
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:27,450
you can do really well in this country 
and,

3393
02:11:27,550 --> 02:11:28,470
and you know,
and,

3394
02:11:28,850 --> 02:11:30,510
and even those times when,
I dunno,

3395
02:11:30,660 --> 02:11:32,040
maybe,
maybe I'm just kidding myself.

3396
02:11:32,041 --> 02:11:35,130
Maybe I'd like to continue believing 
that and maybe who knows?

3397
02:11:35,131 --> 02:11:36,310
Maybe it's not true.
I,

3398
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:38,340
you know,
I got young kids so I'm going to,

3399
02:11:38,341 --> 02:11:39,660
I'm going to continue to believe it's 
true.

3400
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:42,990
I think it's true for the most part,
but I think it's complicated.

3401
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:45,210
And I also think this is a very unusual 
place.

3402
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:47,490
This country's only a couple hundred 
years old.

3403
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:49,710
And that's weird.
It's weird to believe that.

3404
02:11:49,711 --> 02:11:52,620
We mean really essentially founded in 
1776.

3405
02:11:52,621 --> 02:11:56,790
I mean,
th 200 plus years is not long at all.

3406
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:59,330
Hear you talking about it's going to 
what you're,

3407
02:11:59,640 --> 02:12:00,840
I mean,
1776.

3408
02:12:00,841 --> 02:12:03,300
Yeah.
George Washington knew the importance of

3409
02:12:03,301 --> 02:12:04,134
intelligence.
He talked about the importance of 

3410
02:12:04,771 --> 02:12:06,710
intelligence in the revolutionary war.
I mean,

3411
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:09,060
the first,
and I'll probably get this wrong,

3412
02:12:09,061 --> 02:12:12,650
but the first entry into the,
uh,

3413
02:12:13,470 --> 02:12:14,303
the,
what do they call that book of 

3414
02:12:14,821 --> 02:12:15,740
expenditures,
you know,

3415
02:12:15,741 --> 02:12:17,570
that the accounting book that they kept 
anyway,

3416
02:12:17,850 --> 02:12:21,240
basically the first entry was to pay for
spies.

3417
02:12:21,470 --> 02:12:22,460
Um,
and,

3418
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:23,910
and,
and it was,

3419
02:12:23,911 --> 02:12:25,830
it was to establish a spy network,
I believe,

3420
02:12:25,831 --> 02:12:26,664
outside of Boston.
And so they understood even at that 

3421
02:12:29,221 --> 02:12:30,420
time,
the importance of it.

3422
02:12:30,421 --> 02:12:30,710
So,
yeah,

3423
02:12:30,710 --> 02:12:32,200
to your point,
yeah,

3424
02:12:32,201 --> 02:12:32,791
it was,
this has been,

3425
02:12:32,791 --> 02:12:35,310
telephones has been people listening in 
and,

3426
02:12:35,940 --> 02:12:36,773
um,
and you need to check and balance that 

3427
02:12:38,131 --> 02:12:40,560
and you need to ensure that it's not 
overreaching.

3428
02:12:40,561 --> 02:12:42,010
I get all of that.
Uh,

3429
02:12:42,020 --> 02:12:46,380
I'm just saying that when you do find 
that point and congress enacts a law and

3430
02:12:46,381 --> 02:12:47,250
the courts,
you know,

3431
02:12:47,251 --> 02:12:50,310
go with it and say yes,
when you do that then and you're jumping

3432
02:12:50,311 --> 02:12:51,144
through the hoops that have been put in 
place and you've got to theoretically 

3433
02:12:54,181 --> 02:12:55,200
again the place to,
you know,

3434
02:12:55,201 --> 02:12:56,034
you would always like to think that we 
have committees up on the hill that are 

3435
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:03,480
inquisitive and aggressive in their 
questioning and you know,

3436
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:04,650
are paying attention.

3437
02:13:05,550 --> 02:13:07,800
Um,
but when all that is done,

3438
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:09,173
then you'd like to think if you have an 
operational concern and you go through 

3439
02:13:11,251 --> 02:13:14,550
those hoops that yeah,
you'd be able to get the job done.

3440
02:13:14,570 --> 02:13:15,780
Kind of bringing it back to the apple.

3441
02:13:16,010 --> 02:13:19,370
So I think kind of in a lot of ways 
we're talking about,

3442
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:22,100
we're talking about a lot of 
similarities that we have.

3443
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:26,000
On one hand we have the,
the ideal utopia,

3444
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:30,950
we have the shining light of honor and 
dignity and then you have the dire

3445
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:34,260
of the worst case scenario,
right?

3446
02:13:34,570 --> 02:13:38,130
And we're trying to,
we're kind of in the mix,

3447
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:39,260
right?
And that's,

3448
02:13:39,261 --> 02:13:40,680
that's sort of life

3449
02:13:41,450 --> 02:13:43,390
slowly off.
And I think that's people it,

3450
02:13:43,510 --> 02:13:44,343
you know,
there's one thing you learn in the 

3451
02:13:44,961 --> 02:13:45,794
agency is that it's not black.
There's nothing black and white about 

3452
02:13:48,201 --> 02:13:49,430
the,
about about the world.

3453
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:50,593
And you learn the CIA is very good at 
teaching you how to sort of exist in 

3454
02:13:54,551 --> 02:13:55,384
the,
in the gray areas and understand that 

3455
02:13:56,241 --> 02:13:58,070
you're never going to get all the 
information that you want.

3456
02:13:58,420 --> 02:13:59,241
You know,
if it's not,

3457
02:13:59,241 --> 02:14:00,074
it's not like the beach books for the 
feature films where they get all the 

3458
02:14:01,881 --> 02:14:04,940
details and okay now it's time to go,
let's do that operation.

3459
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:06,193
You know,
I remember most of the stuff that I was 

3460
02:14:08,121 --> 02:14:09,170
doing,
most of the operations,

3461
02:14:09,171 --> 02:14:10,310
you know,
in the back of mind you're thinking,

3462
02:14:10,311 --> 02:14:11,900
boy,
I hope this isn't getting fucked up.

3463
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:13,020
You know,
because we're,

3464
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,470
you're not,
if you wait for all the information,

3465
02:14:15,680 --> 02:14:16,513
you know,
before you,

3466
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:18,710
before you do something,
something bad's going to happen.

3467
02:14:18,770 --> 02:14:19,341
It's going to,
it's,

3468
02:14:19,341 --> 02:14:20,780
it's,
it's going to be a fucking go up.

3469
02:14:20,781 --> 02:14:22,520
You've got to get off the exit a certain
point.

3470
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:25,160
And usually that's before you have that 
full comfort.

3471
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:28,670
And so you,
they teach you very well how to do that,

3472
02:14:28,671 --> 02:14:31,910
how to do risk versus gain calculations 
and how to figure out,

3473
02:14:31,911 --> 02:14:33,110
okay,
this is what we're going to have to,

3474
02:14:33,150 --> 02:14:36,980
but you got to make a decision at some 
point the world like it to be,

3475
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:37,911
you know,
again,

3476
02:14:37,911 --> 02:14:38,744
sort of a zero risk.
That's why we always talk about counter 

3477
02:14:40,041 --> 02:14:40,761
terrorism and they say,
well,

3478
02:14:40,761 --> 02:14:42,590
what am I going to get this over with?
We're not,

3479
02:14:42,710 --> 02:14:43,580
you know,
it's just a,

3480
02:14:44,670 --> 02:14:47,750
and you evolve as a species.
Yeah.

3481
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:49,550
I,
that's really what it's going to cry.

3482
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:53,750
It's going to have to come down to 
something pretty fucking astronomical to

3483
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,830
have no more violence,
no more crime,

3484
02:14:55,831 --> 02:14:57,600
no more espionage,
no more,

3485
02:14:58,170 --> 02:14:59,760
no more hate.
Yeah.

3486
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:00,713
Yeah.
I don't,

3487
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,690
you know what I suspect I didn't in,
in your lifetime.

3488
02:15:03,691 --> 02:15:05,130
In my lifetime.
I know.

3489
02:15:05,150 --> 02:15:06,420
I know.
It's so disappointing.

3490
02:15:06,930 --> 02:15:08,400
Uh,
what do I give everybody?

3491
02:15:08,401 --> 02:15:11,040
Mushrooms.
I might do the trick.

3492
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:13,720
I don't know.
That's it.

3493
02:15:13,980 --> 02:15:16,590
Mike Baker for president.
Give everybody mushrooms.

3494
02:15:16,620 --> 02:15:18,330
That's,
that's your tagline.

3495
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:19,920
That's it.
You don't want to be president.

3496
02:15:19,950 --> 02:15:20,783
Nobody wants to be fucking president.
And I really think we should get rid of 

3497
02:15:22,381 --> 02:15:24,120
presidents.
What would we have instead?

3498
02:15:24,270 --> 02:15:25,103
I think a giant committee of super 
intelligent people that aren't entirely 

3499
02:15:28,651 --> 02:15:29,820
responsible.
One,

3500
02:15:29,821 --> 02:15:30,654
not one figurehead.
I think that figurehead is a primate 

3501
02:15:32,731 --> 02:15:33,564
thing.
I think we always want the one alpha 

3502
02:15:34,891 --> 02:15:36,480
primate,
they had a big silver back.

3503
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:39,120
Yeah.
The wanting to watch the whole leader of

3504
02:15:39,121 --> 02:15:39,954
the tribe thing.
But that shit just can't work with 300 

3505
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,040
million people.
It's just too crazy.

3506
02:15:44,041 --> 02:15:48,420
And they all go gray so quick.
They get so fucking old man.

3507
02:15:49,230 --> 02:15:51,390
There's so much pressure on those guys.

3508
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:52,151
Yeah.
And it's,

3509
02:15:52,151 --> 02:15:53,040
and,
and you know what it's,

3510
02:15:53,041 --> 02:15:54,730
it's also uh,
yeah,

3511
02:15:54,740 --> 02:15:55,573
I mean yeah,

3512
02:15:56,490 --> 02:15:57,291
President Obama.
Yeah.

3513
02:15:57,291 --> 02:16:00,710
He writes a good looking guy.
Smooth faced,

3514
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:01,753
handsome young,
vibrant looking guy and now he light 

3515
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:05,190
hair.
Yeah.

3516
02:16:05,190 --> 02:16:07,730
Not only that,
its face has fallen off his bones.

3517
02:16:07,731 --> 02:16:08,540
Yeah.
The Guy,

3518
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:10,430
he's,
he looks so tired.

3519
02:16:10,970 --> 02:16:12,770
Well,
slept in years.

3520
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:15,350
Say It,
the weight of that job.

3521
02:16:15,890 --> 02:16:17,510
Um,
but you know,

3522
02:16:17,511 --> 02:16:19,990
someone who has always shouldered it and
somebody is always watching it,

3523
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:22,140
the job.
But wasn't it a different weight?

3524
02:16:22,620 --> 02:16:26,650
Was it different?
He was

3525
02:16:26,650 --> 02:16:28,740
dealing with depression,
the recession,

3526
02:16:28,750 --> 02:16:31,090
the,
and dealing with world war two.

3527
02:16:31,091 --> 02:16:33,040
I mean,
I think it's always been,

3528
02:16:33,070 --> 02:16:35,560
it's always,
it's just a terrible job.

3529
02:16:35,770 --> 02:16:36,820
Terrible job.
Part of it.

3530
02:16:36,821 --> 02:16:39,760
I think that the biggest problem now is 
the speed of information,

3531
02:16:39,761 --> 02:16:42,690
right?
So everybody's a fucking journalist on,

3532
02:16:42,710 --> 02:16:43,990
on twitter.
Uh,

3533
02:16:43,991 --> 02:16:47,290
everybody's a judge and jury and all 
through the speed of information,

3534
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:50,080
uh,
nobody bothers to check facts anymore.

3535
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:52,480
Everybody's racing to get ahead of the 
news cycle,

3536
02:16:52,481 --> 02:16:54,730
which exists in,
in minutes now instead of hours.

3537
02:16:54,731 --> 02:16:56,310
I mean,
remember we used to be white,

3538
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:57,550
you know,
like the five o'clock news,

3539
02:16:57,551 --> 02:17:01,060
the 11 o'clock news all day long.
Journalist had time to check their facts

3540
02:17:01,061 --> 02:17:01,894
and their stories and their sources 
because they just had that one newscast 

3541
02:17:04,081 --> 02:17:08,440
or two newscasts in the evening.
And now let's fucking throw it out there

3542
02:17:08,441 --> 02:17:09,340
and hope that,
you know,

3543
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:10,450
we don't get it wrong.

3544
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:13,870
So I think that weighs on,
on anybody who's in politics.

3545
02:17:14,130 --> 02:17:16,360
Uh,
maybe it serves a good purpose as well.

3546
02:17:16,361 --> 02:17:17,290
It keeps,
who knows?

3547
02:17:17,291 --> 02:17:18,820
Maybe it keeps them more honest.
I don't know.

3548
02:17:18,821 --> 02:17:20,080
But,
uh,

3549
02:17:20,380 --> 02:17:21,213
anyway,
I think that has something to do with 

3550
02:17:21,731 --> 02:17:22,564
it.
Looking at Obama then and now look at 

3551
02:17:23,771 --> 02:17:24,850
this photo.
Look at this.

3552
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:26,950
Geez,
that's incredible.

3553
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:31,300
That's a 20 year difference.
That's a 20 year difference in less than

3554
02:17:31,301 --> 02:17:36,301
eight years to 2006.
January,

3555
02:17:37,150 --> 02:17:39,050
2016.
You can throw up like a seven year split

3556
02:17:39,051 --> 02:17:42,910
on trump now and see what trump will 
look like after seven years in office is

3557
02:17:42,911 --> 02:17:46,640
going to look like Jabba the hut.
His face is already fighting gravity.

3558
02:17:46,730 --> 02:17:48,290
Wow.
The poor guy.

3559
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:51,380
I so rich to one,
Jesus Christ.

3560
02:17:51,381 --> 02:17:53,900
What are you eating then?
None of them are healthy.

3561
02:17:53,901 --> 02:17:56,390
How about Bernie Sanders?
Bernie's Bernie Sanders is going to look

3562
02:17:56,391 --> 02:17:57,710
like a question mark.

3563
02:17:57,710 --> 02:18:00,710
He's going to like Ben completely over 
his posture.

3564
02:18:00,711 --> 02:18:02,720
So awful already.
Like someone should teach.

3565
02:18:02,721 --> 02:18:04,760
That guy had a stand up straight and 
he's not that old,

3566
02:18:04,761 --> 02:18:06,110
much older than Clinton.
Right?

3567
02:18:06,140 --> 02:18:07,880
He's only a couple of years older than 
she was like,

3568
02:18:07,940 --> 02:18:08,773
Shit.
Yeah.

3569
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:10,910
Well she's not holding up that well.
She doesn't look good.

3570
02:18:10,911 --> 02:18:11,990
Yeah.
Well they did this bill.

3571
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:12,710
You look at that.
I look out,

3572
02:18:12,710 --> 02:18:13,550
he was like,
Shit.

3573
02:18:13,580 --> 02:18:15,230
Oh Geez.
They rolled him out.

3574
02:18:15,231 --> 02:18:17,150
I think they realized right away.
That's a bad idea.

3575
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:18,320
Well,
didn't he have,

3576
02:18:18,380 --> 02:18:20,600
he had like some serious heart surgery,
right?

3577
02:18:20,660 --> 02:18:21,440
Yeah,
he did.

3578
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:22,273
Yeah.
But he's a smart son of a bitch and he 

3579
02:18:23,121 --> 02:18:23,830
was,
you know,

3580
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:25,910
he,
he was fortunate in a lot of ways.

3581
02:18:25,911 --> 02:18:27,110
And He,
and he governed well and he,

3582
02:18:27,130 --> 02:18:28,210
he understood the,
the,

3583
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:29,053
the,
the importance of compromise and 

3584
02:18:29,931 --> 02:18:30,940
negotiation,
I think.

3585
02:18:31,370 --> 02:18:33,260
And that was still at a time when you 
could do that.

3586
02:18:33,260 --> 02:18:34,093
I think,
I don't know whether it's still 

3587
02:18:34,701 --> 02:18:35,511
possible.
I mean,

3588
02:18:35,511 --> 02:18:37,470
look at the,
some of the shit that comes out of that,

3589
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:40,310
the Capitol Hill where,
you know,

3590
02:18:40,340 --> 02:18:41,173
I mean,
it Scalia is barely dead and people are 

3591
02:18:43,281 --> 02:18:45,380
saying,
we're not going to listen to anybody who

3592
02:18:45,381 --> 02:18:46,670
gets proposed a,
you know,

3593
02:18:46,671 --> 02:18:48,170
come in here and replace them.
And you think,

3594
02:18:48,171 --> 02:18:50,030
well,
you probably could have held off on that

3595
02:18:50,031 --> 02:18:50,864
statement for a little while.
Democrats were so excited to get a 

3596
02:18:53,121 --> 02:18:54,590
liberal in their,
oh,

3597
02:18:54,630 --> 02:18:56,400
Bama can appoint a liberal.
Yeah,

3598
02:18:56,440 --> 02:18:57,273
exactly.
And now he's throwing a left curve and 

3599
02:18:59,421 --> 02:18:59,721
said,
well,

3600
02:18:59,721 --> 02:19:00,620
maybe I'll,
you know,

3601
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:01,513
who knows?
Maybe somebody who is a Republican and 

3602
02:19:03,501 --> 02:19:05,150
you can imagine that's,
is that what he said?

3603
02:19:05,180 --> 02:19:05,901
That's what he said.
Yeah.

3604
02:19:05,901 --> 02:19:07,220
What's it?
I forgot what the guy's name is.

3605
02:19:07,221 --> 02:19:12,221
He's a former governor and is a salad.
What about hope and change and now we've

3606
02:19:12,981 --> 02:19:14,300
got to get Bernie in there because 
he'll,

3607
02:19:14,360 --> 02:19:16,010
he'll,
he'll hold the flag.

3608
02:19:16,190 --> 02:19:20,390
I love to go camping when Obama just 
spent a week with them just to get drunk

3609
02:19:20,391 --> 02:19:22,350
with them every night.
Just tell me every day.

3610
02:19:22,351 --> 02:19:24,590
Yeah,
what the fuck is going on?

3611
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:27,650
What does that kid like?
The guy is only three or four older than

3612
02:19:27,651 --> 02:19:28,130
me.

3613
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:29,960
It's gotta be a good feeling to have 
that last day.

3614
02:19:29,961 --> 02:19:30,771
I mean,
I know this probably,

3615
02:19:30,771 --> 02:19:32,650
there's obviously a lot of sadness and 
there's a lot of worry about,

3616
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:33,950
well what,
how am I going to be remembered?

3617
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:36,680
But that last fucking day when you 
finally get to hand over the keys,

3618
02:19:36,830 --> 02:19:38,650
get the hell out of there and go have a,
you know,

3619
02:19:38,690 --> 02:19:39,523
a few pops and not have to worry about 
waking up in the middle of the night 

3620
02:19:41,451 --> 02:19:42,950
because some disasters going on.
Yeah,

3621
02:19:42,951 --> 02:19:45,140
but he's still got,
he knows too much.

3622
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:47,100
So the consequences of all that 
knowledge,

3623
02:19:47,101 --> 02:19:50,090
you've got to been weighing on his head.
All these pieces that are in play,

3624
02:19:50,300 --> 02:19:53,360
where are they going to wind up in a 
book or the book deal,

3625
02:19:53,361 --> 02:19:54,194
a book deal and his own conscience mind.
And then also the fact that he's got to 

3626
02:20:00,471 --> 02:20:03,170
have secret service for the rest of his 
life.

3627
02:20:03,410 --> 02:20:05,780
He was driving around and bulletproof 
cars forever.

3628
02:20:05,781 --> 02:20:06,614
That guy can't go to the fucking mall.
He'd give up your right to go to the 

3629
02:20:09,141 --> 02:20:10,010
movies.
Well,

3630
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:12,560
I wouldn't mind if I didn't ever go to 
the mall again.

3631
02:20:13,070 --> 02:20:13,903
Quite frankly,
I'll be pressing if that means I can't 

3632
02:20:15,321 --> 02:20:18,140
go back into a mall so much he can do 
though.

3633
02:20:18,250 --> 02:20:19,810
I know you're right.
You can't go to the ball game,

3634
02:20:19,830 --> 02:20:22,190
buy a ticket at the last minute and go 
in and just sit in the bleachers.

3635
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:23,153
You imagine if you do that and say Obama
comes and sits down next to you with a 

3636
02:20:25,341 --> 02:20:30,341
dog and a pretzel and it's a Co parent 
who would be sell feed Nachos.

3637
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:32,090
Yeah.
They would swarm him.

3638
02:20:32,091 --> 02:20:35,350
If he didn't have secret service,
they would smother him with selfies till

3639
02:20:35,370 --> 02:20:36,203
the,
there was no air and suffocate died of 

3640
02:20:38,331 --> 02:20:39,410
selfies.
Hey,

3641
02:20:39,411 --> 02:20:40,244
you probably should have held off on the
whole selfie thing when they was in the 

3642
02:20:41,870 --> 02:20:41,870
White House.

3643
02:20:41,870 --> 02:20:42,703
So it'd be fair that walking around the 
White House with a selfie stick was at 

3644
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:48,020
and selfie sticks or unpresidential.
Yeah.

3645
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:51,830
I think there's certain things you do 
and you don't do and whether it's him or

3646
02:20:51,831 --> 02:20:54,390
whether it's any other president,
I think there's,

3647
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:57,200
there's something to be said for 
maintaining the dignity,

3648
02:20:57,230 --> 02:20:59,160
the dignity of,
of an office there.

3649
02:20:59,260 --> 02:21:00,093
Yeah.
There to fucking take a selfie just by 

3650
02:21:06,231 --> 02:21:10,870
yourself and you need a camera to do 
that just seems weird that I uh,

3651
02:21:11,410 --> 02:21:13,310
eh,
that's odd.

3652
02:21:13,490 --> 02:21:15,260
And what a sign of the Times that is 
though.

3653
02:21:15,261 --> 02:21:16,094
Seen him there with a magic wand where 
the fucking phone and well did you see 

3654
02:21:18,651 --> 02:21:19,484
him before when he was like a pure and 
around the corner with his sunglasses 

3655
02:21:21,141 --> 02:21:23,570
but tending to be James Bond and you 
know what also,

3656
02:21:23,571 --> 02:21:27,920
I bet he has the iphone six and not the 
six plus because they,

3657
02:21:27,921 --> 02:21:30,170
well we don't want you to look 
excessive,

3658
02:21:30,171 --> 02:21:30,920
Mr President.

3659
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:33,410
It's probably a decision.
Go with a smaller phone.

3660
02:21:33,411 --> 02:21:34,220
Mr.
Preston.

3661
02:21:34,220 --> 02:21:37,760
A little bit more approachable.
We don't want you outrageous like I want

3662
02:21:37,761 --> 02:21:39,340
a viper.
You can't try the viper.

3663
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:42,050
Not Fiber,
but it's an American car.

3664
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:44,300
I can never have a fight for,
I can imagine.

3665
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:48,680
Drove a viper on at Ford 158 corvette 
convertible.

3666
02:21:49,310 --> 02:21:51,650
Oh Man.
Fucking big elvis sunglasses.

3667
02:21:51,651 --> 02:21:54,440
Yeah.
I'm afraid you fucks.

3668
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:55,593
If it was me and I finished up,
I would drive away from the White House 

3669
02:21:57,621 --> 02:21:59,560
in my last day in an El Camino.
This is,

3670
02:21:59,820 --> 02:22:01,940
this is the fact that drives my wife 
crazy.

3671
02:22:02,220 --> 02:22:04,760
I,
I've always always wanted an El Camino.

3672
02:22:04,790 --> 02:22:06,890
I've always kept my eye out for,
you know what,

3673
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:09,770
uh,
you give me an El Camino every year.

3674
02:22:09,930 --> 02:22:10,763
Uh,
it was manufactured and I would be a 

3675
02:22:12,081 --> 02:22:15,730
happy boy.
I don't know why it's,

3676
02:22:15,910 --> 02:22:17,180
it's,
it's irrational.

3677
02:22:17,420 --> 02:22:19,700
And my wife hates it because she thinks 
it's a,

3678
02:22:19,701 --> 02:22:21,500
it's a horrible looking car.
Do you have one?

3679
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:23,330
I don't.
I've got my latest,

3680
02:22:23,450 --> 02:22:25,500
my latest by was a as a,
uh,

3681
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:26,100
a wagon

3682
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:27,240
here.
Remember the old jeep wagon?

3683
02:22:27,241 --> 02:22:29,400
Yes.
With a wood panel on the side I bought,

3684
02:22:29,790 --> 02:22:31,890
I bought one of those and it's uh,
it's uh,

3685
02:22:31,891 --> 02:22:34,770
actually being redone at a,
at bucks four by four.

3686
02:22:34,771 --> 02:22:37,830
And uh,
in Idaho for all your,

3687
02:22:38,420 --> 02:22:41,160
all your automotive needs.
So you bought it and you're refurbishing

3688
02:22:41,161 --> 02:22:43,860
it or is it the last year they 
manufactured it?

3689
02:22:43,890 --> 02:22:44,723
91 91.
And it's got an original Shag carpeting 

3690
02:22:47,551 --> 02:22:48,540
in there and it's,
uh,

3691
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:49,110
it's just,
uh,

3692
02:22:49,110 --> 02:22:51,180
it's a brilliant vehicle.
I've got the big bench seat.

3693
02:22:51,181 --> 02:22:53,710
Remember the bench seat you'd have and 
cc that was,

3694
02:22:53,730 --> 02:22:56,010
those are good when you went around 
corners just slid all over them.

3695
02:22:56,020 --> 02:22:56,853
Now that it,
depending on if you had to girl by your 

3696
02:22:58,021 --> 02:23:00,780
side,
then you take a hard left turn.

3697
02:23:00,810 --> 02:23:01,970
Oh,
what are you doing over here?

3698
02:23:02,020 --> 02:23:03,970
It was bench seats.
It is.

3699
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:06,450
Yeah.
Almost like that.

3700
02:23:06,451 --> 02:23:09,170
Huh?
I ain't even one car.

3701
02:23:09,630 --> 02:23:12,630
That's a piece of shit that is done.
I can you say that,

3702
02:23:12,631 --> 02:23:14,790
look at that son of a bitch.
That's a fucking ugly.

3703
02:23:14,791 --> 02:23:15,624
God is a car right there.
And you know what that thing weighs 

3704
02:23:18,001 --> 02:23:19,560
about 400,000
tons.

3705
02:23:19,870 --> 02:23:24,870
It is solid steel.
I tap you tap.

3706
02:23:26,080 --> 02:23:27,410
That's been,
yeah,

3707
02:23:27,460 --> 02:23:29,820
that's weird.
Yeah.

3708
02:23:29,850 --> 02:23:33,590
That shouldn't happen.
You want it classic classic test,

3709
02:23:33,591 --> 02:23:34,424
right?
You keep it classy and like the wood 

3710
02:23:35,821 --> 02:23:36,420
panel.
Oh,

3711
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:37,500
are you kidding me?
Of course.

3712
02:23:37,630 --> 02:23:38,463
Yeah.

3713
02:23:40,300 --> 02:23:45,300
See that's validate all the common sense
that you've laid out on this podcast.

3714
02:23:45,391 --> 02:23:46,224
The less,
there's a lot of people out there that 

3715
02:23:48,220 --> 02:23:50,430
they would look at the woodside wagon 
here and say,

3716
02:23:50,431 --> 02:23:51,181
yeah,
I get it.

3717
02:23:51,181 --> 02:23:53,460
That's a great vehicle Camino,
to be fair.

3718
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:56,380
A lot more throwing up in their mouth.
Yeah.

3719
02:23:56,490 --> 02:23:59,250
Well,
you know,

3720
02:23:59,251 --> 02:24:00,910
thank you for that.
Um,

3721
02:24:01,170 --> 02:24:01,801
but yeah,
that's,

3722
02:24:01,801 --> 02:24:02,920
that's sort of the,
uh,

3723
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:04,493
I know.
And then another thing that the 57 Bel 

3724
02:24:06,870 --> 02:24:09,080
Air,
I'm a big Belair Belair.

3725
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:11,880
That's a beautiful thing.
There's no doubt about that.

3726
02:24:11,940 --> 02:24:12,773
I sit and watch for entertainment and my
two older boys will sit there and just 

3727
02:24:16,201 --> 02:24:17,034
be as happy as clams watching with me.
I'll watch Barrett Jackson auction and 

3728
02:24:20,870 --> 02:24:22,440
meet too fancy.
See,

3729
02:24:22,441 --> 02:24:23,520
look at me.
Come auction.

3730
02:24:23,521 --> 02:24:26,940
One time I got caught in a rabbit holes 
sitting in my house and it came on.

3731
02:24:26,941 --> 02:24:28,230
I watch it for two fucking hours.

3732
02:24:28,250 --> 02:24:29,880
Just watch people buy a car.
It's all you do.

3733
02:24:30,330 --> 02:24:31,330
It's insane.
And you know,

3734
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:33,260
and,
and it's just so much,

3735
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:35,920
I look at that whether it was a 1970 
challenges.

3736
02:24:36,130 --> 02:24:38,130
Oh that's,
that's a beautiful car.

3737
02:24:38,131 --> 02:24:39,570
Damn car right there.
Wow.

3738
02:24:39,690 --> 02:24:41,820
What our car,
what a shape.

3739
02:24:41,970 --> 02:24:46,970
I know that a 55 and 57 the old days 
when it was,

3740
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:52,320
what they would do is,
I mean it was all based on aspiration,

3741
02:24:52,350 --> 02:24:54,150
right?
So we had the space program,

3742
02:24:54,180 --> 02:24:55,013
you know,
there was starting to build and you 

3743
02:24:56,450 --> 02:24:58,510
know,
and you could see it in,

3744
02:24:58,511 --> 02:24:59,830
in the vehicles,
you could see,

3745
02:24:59,850 --> 02:25:00,683
you could see what that,
what that time was like by looking at 

3746
02:25:02,881 --> 02:25:06,390
the cars under the excess of it all.
And then the dreaming.

3747
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:09,380
It's special.
Yeah.

3748
02:25:09,720 --> 02:25:11,030
Bumper.
Oh God.

3749
02:25:11,190 --> 02:25:14,280
The shyness.
It's such a strange shape too.

3750
02:25:14,281 --> 02:25:16,800
So gorgeous.
Anyway,

3751
02:25:16,801 --> 02:25:19,560
and then there's five mercury,
a Sun Valley's mercury.

3752
02:25:19,561 --> 02:25:21,420
Sun Valley's are another good guy.
Could go anyway.

3753
02:25:21,450 --> 02:25:22,590
Nomads.
I mean just,

3754
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:24,010
it's just so many good cars

3755
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:25,420
out there.
But um,

3756
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:27,130
yeah,
I went to high school with her dad had a

3757
02:25:27,131 --> 02:25:28,870
55.
Oh my God.

3758
02:25:28,871 --> 02:25:31,120
It was gorgeous.
It was one of those cars to drive it.

3759
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:32,200
No,
no,

3760
02:25:32,201 --> 02:25:35,290
I didn't know her that well and he would
never probably let anybody drive it,

3761
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:37,140
but he would just drive by,
you know,

3762
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:37,993
it was,
there was two cars in my neighborhood 

3763
02:25:39,311 --> 02:25:41,110
when I grew up that were one,
one,

3764
02:25:41,111 --> 02:25:41,891
uh,
my,

3765
02:25:41,891 --> 02:25:42,724
uh,
sister's boyfriend's brother had a 65 

3766
02:25:46,210 --> 02:25:48,970
gto convertible,
cherry red.

3767
02:25:49,490 --> 02:25:50,810
That was,
he was the king.

3768
02:25:51,140 --> 02:25:51,973
This guy was the king.
He would drive down the neighborhood 

3769
02:25:53,750 --> 02:25:57,400
neighborhood.
Cliff's June was his name.

3770
02:25:57,940 --> 02:26:00,400
It said Chirps on his bumper.
Stickers.

3771
02:26:00,600 --> 02:26:01,433
License plate was chirps and he would 
drive this thing and he would slam 

3772
02:26:03,941 --> 02:26:04,774
through the gears and the wheels will go
cause they had a little skinny ass 

3773
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:09,820
fucking shitty tires back then.

3774
02:26:09,970 --> 02:26:11,830
And then there was another guys car.
So,

3775
02:26:11,890 --> 02:26:12,723
oh my God.
Yeah.

3776
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:14,740
There's something about those cars to 
this day,

3777
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:16,790
like commanding the top dollar now.
It used to,

3778
02:26:16,850 --> 02:26:17,630
it used to be,
you know,

3779
02:26:17,630 --> 02:26:19,420
you'd get,
you'd be into the 50s and,

3780
02:26:19,421 --> 02:26:20,254
and that was when the big dollars where,
but now that they've gotten back into 

3781
02:26:22,781 --> 02:26:23,640
the muscle cars,
you know,

3782
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:27,610
there's a year that they go the get to 
where they're not worth anything.

3783
02:26:27,611 --> 02:26:31,780
Like the 1980s shit.
Well you remember that point in time,

3784
02:26:31,781 --> 02:26:32,614
there was a very sad point in time when 
all of a sudden you realized that the 

3785
02:26:34,650 --> 02:26:36,820
trans-am,
the Camaro,

3786
02:26:37,260 --> 02:26:38,093
the Mustang,
they all started to look just the same 

3787
02:26:41,650 --> 02:26:42,910
and you started,
it fell apart.

3788
02:26:42,940 --> 02:26:44,650
Oh,
mustangs were pieces of shit.

3789
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:46,720
Now they,
they've,

3790
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:48,790
they've done a good job of trying to 
revitalize that.

3791
02:26:48,791 --> 02:26:50,170
But there was that period of time when 
cause everything,

3792
02:26:50,190 --> 02:26:52,090
that Camaro,
he used to be 68,

3793
02:26:52,091 --> 02:26:52,924
69,
remember [inaudible] 69 Camaro was one 

3794
02:26:54,941 --> 02:26:58,260
of the greatest looking at muscle cars 
of all time and hugger orange they had.

3795
02:26:58,261 --> 02:27:01,790
And they made a hugger orange.
[inaudible]

3796
02:27:01,870 --> 02:27:02,780
fuck.
Yeah.

3797
02:27:02,830 --> 02:27:05,550
It had me and I know that with orange 
you saw this thing.

3798
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:06,490
No,
it's a special,

3799
02:27:06,491 --> 02:27:07,700
it's a special color.
Oh,

3800
02:27:07,810 --> 02:27:09,850
hugger orange.
Look that up.

3801
02:27:10,420 --> 02:27:11,680
Anyway,
so,

3802
02:27:11,681 --> 02:27:12,520
uh,
yeah,

3803
02:27:12,521 --> 02:27:15,400
so I'm not sure how we got into that.
Not Bad.

3804
02:27:15,550 --> 02:27:17,320
That's actually not bad.
But you know what,

3805
02:27:17,321 --> 02:27:20,440
that 69 camaro shape is so fucking 
spectacular.

3806
02:27:20,590 --> 02:27:23,200
It is the perfect muscle car shape.
Yeah.

3807
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:24,040
I mean,
it's hard.

3808
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:25,870
It's hard to beat.
It's hard to beat that.

3809
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:27,460
That's about as good as it gets,
man.

3810
02:27:27,580 --> 02:27:29,200
And that's pulled top dollar now.
Oh,

3811
02:27:30,220 --> 02:27:31,053
well they're taking those now.
And they do what they call a pro street 

3812
02:27:34,181 --> 02:27:35,510
conversions.
You know,

3813
02:27:35,540 --> 02:27:38,650
they take a car like that and they do 
everything.

3814
02:27:38,651 --> 02:27:39,870
They do a resto mod.
Right.

3815
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:43,390
So all the breaks are new.
They have modern suspension,

3816
02:27:43,690 --> 02:27:45,520
you know,
they have these um,

3817
02:27:45,670 --> 02:27:46,503
uh,
art morrison chassies that are custom 

3818
02:27:48,221 --> 02:27:49,030
built for those things.

3819
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:53,620
So they take out their funky frames and 
they put in like a really spectacular,

3820
02:27:53,621 --> 02:27:56,020
well-designed frames,
specifically me.

3821
02:27:56,170 --> 02:27:57,003
Look at that for those seats.
Those seats never used to show up at 

3822
02:27:58,631 --> 02:27:59,770
auction because it was like,
yeah,

3823
02:27:59,771 --> 02:28:00,461
look,
it's not,

3824
02:28:00,461 --> 02:28:01,930
you know,
it's not original,

3825
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:02,920
but now.
Yeah.

3826
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:03,813
Yeah.
Well people saying there's still a lot 

3827
02:28:04,991 --> 02:28:07,300
of people that like original,
they're assholes.

3828
02:28:07,301 --> 02:28:09,040
They want,
they want to die in a car accident.

3829
02:28:09,041 --> 02:28:09,940
Those fucking things.
He,

3830
02:28:10,100 --> 02:28:12,430
he hit the brakes and it's like,
you better be ready.

3831
02:28:12,940 --> 02:28:14,820
That way I can hear redone.
Yeah.

3832
02:28:14,830 --> 02:28:15,663
Cause I got dragged those kids around in
there and when you're going to get 

3833
02:28:17,201 --> 02:28:18,730
modern breaks,
put in it and everything.

3834
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:20,730
Yeah.
The whole thing has been been a,

3835
02:28:21,170 --> 02:28:22,040
basically,
you

3836
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:23,920
know what got everything except the 
wood.

3837
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:25,550
Are you going to do the engine?
Yeah.

3838
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:26,433
Well the idea was a complaint,
read belt on the engine fuel injection 

3839
02:28:28,761 --> 02:28:30,050
because first of all,
that's what you want.

3840
02:28:30,051 --> 02:28:31,850
You don't want to go on a carburetor.
Oh my God.

3841
02:28:32,160 --> 02:28:35,280
Personally in Idaho while I had it for a
while before I put it over at,

3842
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:36,133
uh,
at bucks four by four for all your 

3843
02:28:37,490 --> 02:28:39,740
automotive needs,
gas and the carburetors.

3844
02:28:41,150 --> 02:28:41,983
I'd run out there,
I'd be in a hurry yet jumped in and I 

3845
02:28:42,981 --> 02:28:47,981
think anyway,
my faculty out there,

3846
02:28:48,061 --> 02:28:48,894
I was looking to sell their El Camino.
You get in touch with me really that 

3847
02:28:51,891 --> 02:28:52,730
deepen and,
Huh?

3848
02:28:52,820 --> 02:28:54,530
I don't know what I didn't know.
I remember part of it is,

3849
02:28:54,531 --> 02:28:55,364
I remember as a kid I had know I had a 
great hot wheels collection and I 

3850
02:28:59,901 --> 02:29:01,850
remember the El Camino was one of my 
favorites back then.

3851
02:29:01,850 --> 02:29:04,580
Anyway.
So to me it looks like a pickup truck.

3852
02:29:04,581 --> 02:29:05,730
Fuck the Chevelle.
Yeah.

3853
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:06,481
Yeah.
Basically.

3854
02:29:06,481 --> 02:29:07,490
Yeah.
I can't argue with it.

3855
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:09,520
Yeah.
I could have Chevelle.

3856
02:29:09,521 --> 02:29:10,354
So that to me is like,
why would you have that when you can 

3857
02:29:11,661 --> 02:29:12,494
have a Chevelle and 69 Chevelle and one 
of the most beautiful muscle cars ever 

3858
02:29:15,711 --> 02:29:18,720
created,
but a 69 el Camino like wow.

3859
02:29:19,910 --> 02:29:20,990
There it is.
There's the hot wheel.

3860
02:29:20,991 --> 02:29:22,010
Yeah.
That's nice.

3861
02:29:22,590 --> 02:29:23,780
I think.
I think that's mine.

3862
02:29:23,781 --> 02:29:25,640
I think you've got a picture of my very 
own hallway.

3863
02:29:25,660 --> 02:29:27,680
Ooh,
I got one of those sit on my desk in the

3864
02:29:27,681 --> 02:29:29,470
office.
People walk in,

3865
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:31,940
they start and they go,
why do you have this fucking toy?

3866
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:35,090
El Camino.
Google of real 69 El Camino.

3867
02:29:35,091 --> 02:29:37,010
Jamie,
let's see what a real one looks like.

3868
02:29:37,011 --> 02:29:42,011
Not a hot wheel one C for a nice looking
car though.

3869
02:29:42,550 --> 02:29:43,101
The,
you know,

3870
02:29:43,101 --> 02:29:43,934
it's,
the front is so good looking like don't 

3871
02:29:45,781 --> 02:29:46,460
go down that one.

3872
02:29:46,460 --> 02:29:47,990
The one the black and white right below 
that.

3873
02:29:48,020 --> 02:29:50,390
Ooh.
See The bay.

3874
02:29:50,480 --> 02:29:53,390
The back looks like shit though.
That's fraud is so good.

3875
02:29:53,391 --> 02:29:55,250
Look in the back.
Doesn't look that bad,

3876
02:29:55,251 --> 02:29:57,720
but you know it's a place to put your 
dog and you know.

3877
02:29:58,910 --> 02:29:59,743
Anyway,
I forget that you can't drive with your 

3878
02:30:01,581 --> 02:30:04,280
dog in the back of your truck out here.
We do all the time.

3879
02:30:04,510 --> 02:30:05,750
Can,
it wasn't illegal out here.

3880
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:08,520
I suspect somebody would turn your in 
right now.

3881
02:30:08,620 --> 02:30:09,453
How could you dare put your dog out in 
the back of your truck and drive down 

3882
02:30:11,241 --> 02:30:11,830
the street?
That's,

3883
02:30:11,830 --> 02:30:13,790
I was in northern California this 
weekend.

3884
02:30:13,791 --> 02:30:17,390
Some guy was driving around this dog in 
the back of the car and my daughters are

3885
02:30:17,391 --> 02:30:19,090
freaking out until like he just has to 
tall.

3886
02:30:19,130 --> 02:30:22,460
The dog is just running around in the 
back like that's what they do.

3887
02:30:22,490 --> 02:30:24,890
We drive down the street and I see kids 
in the back of pickup trucks.

3888
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:26,840
I mean,
do you remember that car though?

3889
02:30:26,870 --> 02:30:27,703
Remember that car or that car that had 
the plastic seats when the handles in 

3890
02:30:31,551 --> 02:30:34,490
the back facing facing.
What the hell was that?

3891
02:30:34,491 --> 02:30:35,900
That was,
it was like a Subaru.

3892
02:30:35,960 --> 02:30:36,870
Yeah.
There was some kind of guard.

3893
02:30:36,871 --> 02:30:39,440
It had fucking black thing,
little seats in the back.

3894
02:30:39,441 --> 02:30:41,180
We could put the kits and they had 
little handles.

3895
02:30:41,181 --> 02:30:44,030
That was the safety feature.
This little plastic handles the kids get

3896
02:30:44,031 --> 02:30:47,510
a hold onto as you drove down the road 
and the highway doing 70 miles an hour.

3897
02:30:47,511 --> 02:30:49,220
I have to have it.
A couple of Martinis at the old club.

3898
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:51,650
What is that?
A Subaru pickup truck thing.

3899
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:56,570
I don't remember it like it was lacking 
station wagon that had,

3900
02:30:56,571 --> 02:30:59,480
I got a picture of one but a Volkswagen 
station wagon.

3901
02:31:00,410 --> 02:31:01,670
Wow.
Well,

3902
02:31:01,780 --> 02:31:03,140
yeah.
Facing seating now.

3903
02:31:03,170 --> 02:31:03,921
Yeah.
Yeah.

3904
02:31:03,921 --> 02:31:04,580
My,
yeah.

3905
02:31:04,580 --> 02:31:05,413
My Dad had a chevy that had the rear 
facing wagon seat and we also used to 

3906
02:31:08,421 --> 02:31:10,940
fight with me and my brothers would 
fight over it and you know,

3907
02:31:10,941 --> 02:31:12,620
we literally would go to the officer's 
club.

3908
02:31:12,830 --> 02:31:14,760
My Dad would have a few drinks and then 
the pile,

3909
02:31:14,761 --> 02:31:15,890
all the kids back in the,
in the,

3910
02:31:15,891 --> 02:31:19,560
in the Chevy wagon and,
and barrel down the highway as we're all

3911
02:31:19,561 --> 02:31:20,190
flying back

3912
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:22,350
and forth over the seats,
argue with each other and fighting about

3913
02:31:22,351 --> 02:31:25,080
who gets the rear facing seats.
And there was not a fucking seat belt to

3914
02:31:25,081 --> 02:31:25,914
be had.
Well you remember those Toyota land 

3915
02:31:27,631 --> 02:31:28,464
cruisers that had the seats that face 
each other side facing Jay's Fj he's 

3916
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:35,580
forties what it we,
yeah,

3917
02:31:35,581 --> 02:31:36,750
it was Fj 40 right.

3918
02:31:36,990 --> 02:31:38,010
I forget what it was,
but it was,

3919
02:31:38,070 --> 02:31:40,010
yeah,
it was not that long ago that they,

3920
02:31:40,100 --> 02:31:41,760
they,
they had those in the,

3921
02:31:41,761 --> 02:31:43,950
in the Land Rovers for years and years 
and years.

3922
02:31:44,280 --> 02:31:46,120
And including,
you know,

3923
02:31:46,140 --> 02:31:48,390
I want to say like 10 years ago,
they were still building those things in

3924
02:31:48,391 --> 02:31:49,200
the back.
Yeah,

3925
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:50,820
I think so.
It's not that long ago.

3926
02:31:51,550 --> 02:31:53,550
It was,
it was an option on a cause.

3927
02:31:53,551 --> 02:31:57,930
I got a like got a land rover one time 
and it was probably okay to be fair,

3928
02:31:57,931 --> 02:31:59,820
it's more than 10 years.
There's probably 15 years ago,

3929
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:00,833
but I remember that was an option to get
was the the back seats face and I 

3930
02:32:03,871 --> 02:32:05,790
thought well at what point am I ever 
going to use these?

3931
02:32:06,060 --> 02:32:06,893
Yeah,
maybe the F's Fj 40 but that was way 

3932
02:32:08,821 --> 02:32:09,654
more than 10 years ago.
See the F Z J 80 was a classic Land 

3933
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:15,593
Rover and now I was like,
I think they stopped making that 97 or 

3934
02:32:19,411 --> 02:32:20,244
98 and that's a classic one because it 
has a solid front and rear axle and 

3935
02:32:24,721 --> 02:32:27,000
those motherfuckers can drive over 
everything.

3936
02:32:27,330 --> 02:32:28,430
They just,
you know,

3937
02:32:28,950 --> 02:32:32,790
to this day people refurbish them.
Land cruisers are a great vehicle to see

3938
02:32:32,791 --> 02:32:33,600
those.
I mean those,

3939
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:35,100
we used to put those things to all sorts
of,

3940
02:32:35,101 --> 02:32:37,160
she'll come up in London special.
Exactly.

3941
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:40,890
All the Taliban had those land cruisers 
because they never broke down.

3942
02:32:40,891 --> 02:32:41,724
You build that exhaust pipe up over the 
top of the roof for the crossing the 

3943
02:32:44,191 --> 02:32:47,010
fjords,
fjords towards in the desert,

3944
02:32:47,100 --> 02:32:50,130
the fjords,
the snorkel,

3945
02:32:50,131 --> 02:32:52,770
the desert snorkel,
the safari snorkel.

3946
02:32:52,771 --> 02:32:53,604
They would call it a lot.
And we've just released more documents 

3947
02:32:55,591 --> 02:32:56,424
from bin Laden.

3948
02:32:57,110 --> 02:32:57,943
More documented.
The CIA released about 110 documents 

3949
02:33:00,451 --> 02:33:01,740
from the bin Laden raid.
Oh,

3950
02:33:01,741 --> 02:33:03,750
that's right.
It was also about like what he wanted to

3951
02:33:03,751 --> 02:33:05,430
do with his money.
He died.

3952
02:33:05,690 --> 02:33:09,720
He wrote a will for his $29 million.
He had 29 million when he died.

3953
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:10,640
Yeah,
I'm surprised.

3954
02:33:10,641 --> 02:33:11,610
Yeah.
I'm surprised he didn't have more.

3955
02:33:11,611 --> 02:33:13,830
Frankly,
it's days dad was worth billions.

3956
02:33:14,010 --> 02:33:15,660
Well,
this is weird that he was living in some

3957
02:33:15,661 --> 02:33:19,200
fucking strange compound and everybody 
kind of knew it.

3958
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:20,101
Yeah.
Yeah,

3959
02:33:20,101 --> 02:33:20,934
I know.
I know.

3960
02:33:21,180 --> 02:33:23,120
Well it was bizarre.
We haven't done it tonight.

3961
02:33:23,121 --> 02:33:25,380
Should we didn't fight Osama I that I 
no,

3962
02:33:25,470 --> 02:33:26,303
you're kidding me.
And he was in that weird compound in 

3963
02:33:28,681 --> 02:33:30,490
that ha like hiding out.
Yeah.

3964
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,940
It's so,
it's so strange.

3965
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,920
And we got lucky because he was,
he was looking to move.

3966
02:33:34,980 --> 02:33:35,813
It was looking to get on the move again.
I think he probably sensed in part 

3967
02:33:38,191 --> 02:33:40,230
because he,
he'd had some problems with one of the,

3968
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:44,280
one of the facilitators that he had and 
he was looking actually to,

3969
02:33:44,320 --> 02:33:45,153
to,
to replace one of his people that 

3970
02:33:46,651 --> 02:33:47,484
actually dealt with them sort of as 
liaison guy between the Pakistanis and 

3971
02:33:50,521 --> 02:33:53,790
al Qaeda and him.
And so it,

3972
02:33:53,791 --> 02:33:54,624
you know,
we,

3973
02:33:54,780 --> 02:33:56,410
if we,
if we held off,

3974
02:33:56,490 --> 02:33:59,730
if we hadn't found him and then only had
a month to plan,

3975
02:34:00,090 --> 02:34:00,990
uh,
you know,

3976
02:34:01,020 --> 02:34:02,400
it could have gone completely the other 
way.

3977
02:34:02,401 --> 02:34:06,300
We could have shown up and it would have
been an empty place because he was,

3978
02:34:06,301 --> 02:34:09,510
he was actively looking to move to a 
different location.

3979
02:34:09,510 --> 02:34:11,870
Well,
it's kind of funny that the way they had

3980
02:34:11,871 --> 02:34:15,470
to do it was doing in the middle of the 
night land helicopters,

3981
02:34:15,471 --> 02:34:18,070
one of them crashed,
break and then

3982
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:20,050
shoot him that way.
What really,

3983
02:34:20,051 --> 02:34:22,810
they knew where the house was.
If we were really evil,

3984
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:26,020
if we were able yes,
drop one right on that house and fucking

3985
02:34:26,021 --> 02:34:28,030
incinerate and they talked about that as
a scenario.

3986
02:34:28,031 --> 02:34:29,140
In the end,
the decision was looking,

3987
02:34:29,141 --> 02:34:29,974
he's got,
there's women and children in there and 

3988
02:34:31,750 --> 02:34:32,980
how many people were in the house with 
him?

3989
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:35,040
He had his extended family with them.
I'd effect,

3990
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:35,913
you know,
there were,

3991
02:34:37,690 --> 02:34:38,830
there were,
uh,

3992
02:34:39,490 --> 02:34:41,410
I dunno,
seven or eight plus guards,

3993
02:34:41,530 --> 02:34:43,090
but the women and children were there 
and so,

3994
02:34:43,160 --> 02:34:44,110
and the decision was made,
no,

3995
02:34:44,111 --> 02:34:44,980
we can't do that.
We can't,

3996
02:34:44,981 --> 02:34:45,814
we can't fire a rocket down there 
because we don't want to take out all 

3997
02:34:47,771 --> 02:34:49,750
those people.
That's an indication,

3998
02:34:49,810 --> 02:34:50,531
you know,
I can't,

3999
02:34:50,531 --> 02:34:51,161
I mean,
people are to say,

4000
02:34:51,161 --> 02:34:51,851
wow,
fuck you.

4001
02:34:51,851 --> 02:34:54,030
You just want to go after the oil.
But um,

4002
02:34:54,340 --> 02:34:56,230
you know,
trying to do the right thing.

4003
02:34:56,320 --> 02:35:01,320
So to signing a,
an insanely complex operation like that,

4004
02:35:01,870 --> 02:35:04,390
just to save those people that were with
him essentially.

4005
02:35:04,410 --> 02:35:05,081
Right.
And to do,

4006
02:35:05,081 --> 02:35:07,330
and to do the right thing and the idea 
of being,

4007
02:35:07,331 --> 02:35:08,110
well,
maybe we can,

4008
02:35:08,110 --> 02:35:12,220
maybe we can recover them alive.
Maybe we can actually died in that rate.

4009
02:35:12,221 --> 02:35:13,410
Or other people do it too.
Right?

4010
02:35:13,420 --> 02:35:14,290
Guards died.
Yeah.

4011
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:16,900
Yeah.
Did you ever see photos of them?

4012
02:35:16,901 --> 02:35:21,820
Did they let you look at the photos?
A body allegedly?

4013
02:35:21,850 --> 02:35:23,120
Is Anybody listening?
Um,

4014
02:35:23,140 --> 02:35:24,010
no.
No.

4015
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:26,260
It's just between you and me.
Just don't know.

4016
02:35:26,261 --> 02:35:28,780
I didn't say no,
but if you did,

4017
02:35:30,090 --> 02:35:32,080
you could do something to let me know 
that you did.

4018
02:35:32,260 --> 02:35:33,093
You could just to like just my last act 
weird act like you're trying to hide 

4019
02:35:39,101 --> 02:35:39,934
something right as I ask you a question,
like he can't fucken answer this 

4020
02:35:42,350 --> 02:35:43,280
question,
but no,

4021
02:35:43,300 --> 02:35:44,133
I would say,
I mean there's a insanely complex 

4022
02:35:45,251 --> 02:35:46,210
operation,
um,

4023
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:47,890
you know,
full size mock ups,

4024
02:35:47,891 --> 02:35:48,940
you know,
put together of the,

4025
02:35:48,941 --> 02:35:49,401
of the,
uh,

4026
02:35:49,401 --> 02:35:51,730
of the facility of the [inaudible] 
compound.

4027
02:35:52,090 --> 02:35:52,930
Um,
again,

4028
02:35:52,931 --> 02:35:53,764
talking about,
we were talking about before muscle 

4029
02:35:54,521 --> 02:35:55,380
memory,
right?

4030
02:35:55,410 --> 02:35:56,243
You know,
how many fucking steps do I have to go 

4031
02:35:58,540 --> 02:35:59,373
here?
How many steps do I have to get to the 

4032
02:36:00,371 --> 02:36:01,360
end of this wall?
Right?

4033
02:36:01,361 --> 02:36:04,150
You have to know exactly how is places 
laid out,

4034
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:06,790
where he could possibly be and how do 
they do that?

4035
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:07,361
Well,
they,

4036
02:36:07,361 --> 02:36:08,560
I mean,
that's all that work.

4037
02:36:08,561 --> 02:36:11,860
People think that somehow we just rocked
up on his place.

4038
02:36:11,861 --> 02:36:12,694
That was,
that was eight plus years of insane 

4039
02:36:15,251 --> 02:36:20,251
effort trying to locate him and then 
confirm it was him and then,

4040
02:36:22,380 --> 02:36:24,010
you know,
design this operation.

4041
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:26,560
And so there were a lot of,
a lot of moving parts.

4042
02:36:26,561 --> 02:36:28,480
It wasn't just like we said,
oh look great.

4043
02:36:28,690 --> 02:36:29,523
Now we got them.
And that was an impressive that he was 

4044
02:36:30,791 --> 02:36:32,410
able to hide for that long.
Yeah,

4045
02:36:32,470 --> 02:36:33,640
it is.
But there was a lot of,

4046
02:36:33,700 --> 02:36:34,533
uh,
accomplices and mainly like the 

4047
02:36:36,851 --> 02:36:37,684
Pakistani Intel service,
the incredibly duplicitous had someone 

4048
02:36:42,701 --> 02:36:43,620
actually,
uh,

4049
02:36:43,650 --> 02:36:47,860
as his liaison officer within the packy 
Intel Service and,

4050
02:36:48,910 --> 02:36:50,320
and there were a lot of people yeah,
that,

4051
02:36:50,340 --> 02:36:51,173
um,
had a very invested interest in making 

4052
02:36:53,171 --> 02:36:54,360
sure that he,
uh,

4053
02:36:54,490 --> 02:36:55,323
stayed hidden.

4054
02:36:55,780 --> 02:36:57,470
And so,
uh,

4055
02:36:57,550 --> 02:36:58,383
I know people say,
well,

4056
02:36:58,390 --> 02:36:59,860
he was,
it was a tall bearded dude.

4057
02:36:59,890 --> 02:37:01,510
You should've been able to find them.
Well,

4058
02:37:02,160 --> 02:37:04,700
it ain't that easy and all,
and you know,

4059
02:37:04,930 --> 02:37:06,730
it's not as easy as it in the feature 
films.

4060
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:08,890
It just doesn't work that way.
It's not,

4061
02:37:08,920 --> 02:37:09,753
no,
I know,

4062
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:11,740
I know that's disappointing for a lot of
people to hear.

4063
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:12,753
But,
uh,

4064
02:37:12,850 --> 02:37:13,683
it was a great operation and it's 
interesting that they've released these 

4065
02:37:16,251 --> 02:37:17,300
documents and,
and uh,

4066
02:37:17,301 --> 02:37:19,520
at this point in time,
and it is,

4067
02:37:19,910 --> 02:37:20,743
it's fascinating to see kind of inside 
his mind a little bit more and 

4068
02:37:23,661 --> 02:37:24,494
understand to what degree he did or 
didn't have a sort of operational 

4069
02:37:27,891 --> 02:37:30,080
understanding of what al Qaeda was doing
at the time.

4070
02:37:30,110 --> 02:37:31,250
Um,
yeah.

4071
02:37:31,251 --> 02:37:32,084
So anyway,
for those of you that are looking for 

4072
02:37:33,561 --> 02:37:36,470
something to read,
zero,

4073
02:37:36,471 --> 02:37:37,460
dark 30,
that move,

4074
02:37:37,490 --> 02:37:40,940
how accurate was that movie?
Um,

4075
02:37:41,780 --> 02:37:43,570
they make day people.
Yeah.

4076
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:47,900
The girl who was in charge of everything
and telling navy seals.

4077
02:37:47,980 --> 02:37:49,720
Yeah.
It's a composite of people.

4078
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:51,160
It's like,
it's like Hollywood does,

4079
02:37:51,640 --> 02:37:53,140
they do some things really,
really well.

4080
02:37:53,141 --> 02:37:55,480
They do the military a recreation's 
very,

4081
02:37:55,481 --> 02:37:56,251
very well.
I mean,

4082
02:37:56,251 --> 02:37:57,084
he's incredibly well and um,
and then they take bits and pieces and 

4083
02:38:01,451 --> 02:38:03,040
turn them into a character.
Right.

4084
02:38:03,041 --> 02:38:04,240
Which is what they do.
And that's,

4085
02:38:04,241 --> 02:38:05,290
that's the nature of it.
Yeah.

4086
02:38:05,410 --> 02:38:09,400
A dramatic representation of what kind 
of went on,

4087
02:38:09,460 --> 02:38:10,300
but not really

4088
02:38:10,550 --> 02:38:11,383
good.
Juicy or so they have to make an entry 

4089
02:38:12,151 --> 02:38:13,820
door.
You got to condense it down.

4090
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:15,350
You know,
if you,

4091
02:38:15,370 --> 02:38:16,203
if you showed what actually happened,
the audience kill themselves out of 

4092
02:38:18,561 --> 02:38:20,410
boredom because you'd be watching eight 
years worth of,

4093
02:38:20,660 --> 02:38:21,493
of surveillance in eight years worth of 
struggling and understand what one 

4094
02:38:23,481 --> 02:38:26,840
credit card receipt meant in relation to
something that was happening over across

4095
02:38:26,841 --> 02:38:27,674
the other side of the world.
All these things that go into this that 

4096
02:38:29,841 --> 02:38:31,610
nobody ever sees.
So they,

4097
02:38:31,620 --> 02:38:32,031
they,
you know,

4098
02:38:32,031 --> 02:38:33,890
they condense it down and it turns into 
a movie and then,

4099
02:38:34,370 --> 02:38:35,091
and then,
you know,

4100
02:38:35,091 --> 02:38:38,750
up on the hill in Capitol Hill,
they get confused and they don't realize

4101
02:38:38,751 --> 02:38:40,700
that maybe it's a,
maybe it's a movie,

4102
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:41,910
you know,
and so they,

4103
02:38:42,150 --> 02:38:42,983
I don't know if you remember that 
kerfuffle they had after they released 

4104
02:38:45,261 --> 02:38:47,000
it where they called them back and said,
well,

4105
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:49,400
you know,
maybe over the interrogation program,

4106
02:38:49,401 --> 02:38:51,200
maybe you didn't tell us everything,
you know,

4107
02:38:51,260 --> 02:38:51,980
and you think,
well,

4108
02:38:51,980 --> 02:38:53,360
no,
they just made a fucking movie.

4109
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:54,111
You know?
I mean,

4110
02:38:54,111 --> 02:38:56,870
because there were people that were 
upset with zero,

4111
02:38:56,871 --> 02:38:57,704
dark 30 because I thought it,
it put too much importance on 

4112
02:38:59,781 --> 02:39:00,614
interrogation.
And there were people that thought it 

4113
02:39:01,341 --> 02:39:04,700
didn't put enough importance and I'm 
thinking it's a fucking movie.

4114
02:39:04,870 --> 02:39:05,440
You know,
it,

4115
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:06,950
part of it's just entertainment.
You know,

4116
02:39:06,951 --> 02:39:09,170
you're not watching a documentary.
But anyway,

4117
02:39:09,390 --> 02:39:11,790
well there's a,
there's a movie that they made,

4118
02:39:11,791 --> 02:39:13,450
I don't know if you saw the,
um,

4119
02:39:13,460 --> 02:39:18,030
Fox catcher movie that's based on Mark 
and David Schultz.

4120
02:39:18,060 --> 02:39:18,893
The wrestlers.
Yup.

4121
02:39:19,110 --> 02:39:19,943
Yup.
That movie is just filled with bullshit 

4122
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:24,930
and it's a real problem for Mark 
Schultz,

4123
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:25,793
who was an Olympic gold medalist,
one of the best wrestlers the United 

4124
02:39:28,860 --> 02:39:30,810
States has ever produced.
And they,

4125
02:39:30,811 --> 02:39:32,910
they,
and that's that guy's alive.

4126
02:39:32,940 --> 02:39:33,773
Okay.
His brother got shot by that crazy 

4127
02:39:34,591 --> 02:39:35,424
dupont fuck right.
But mark's alive and they changed all 

4128
02:39:38,971 --> 02:39:41,220
sorts of Shit in that movie.
That doesn't make any sense.

4129
02:39:41,370 --> 02:39:44,340
Historical Shit about his career as a 
wrestler,

4130
02:39:44,400 --> 02:39:47,130
his career as a UFC fighter,
they put the,

4131
02:39:47,131 --> 02:39:50,730
they even changed the time where the UFC
was invented.

4132
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:51,833
They made the UFC,
they made him watch the UFC like almost 

4133
02:39:56,491 --> 02:40:00,780
like six or seven years,
I think before it ever really existed.

4134
02:40:01,230 --> 02:40:04,170
And then on top of it,
the guy he watched fight,

4135
02:40:04,440 --> 02:40:06,390
was it historical character?

4136
02:40:06,390 --> 02:40:07,223
Big Daddy Goodrich.
Gary Good rich was one of the original 

4137
02:40:10,171 --> 02:40:15,171
pioneers of MMA and he in the movie 
watching Gary Goodrich fight,

4138
02:40:15,301 --> 02:40:16,134
Paul Herrera when in reality he fought 
Gary Goodrich and his first UFC fight 

4139
02:40:21,090 --> 02:40:24,990
also in the movie Mark Schultz is in 
fighting in the UFC.

4140
02:40:24,991 --> 02:40:29,880
In his first fight he's fighting in some
small organization and it's like kind of

4141
02:40:29,881 --> 02:40:32,790
sad and he's fighting a white Russian 
dude.

4142
02:40:33,240 --> 02:40:35,610
He fought a black guy named Gary 
Goodrich.

4143
02:40:35,790 --> 02:40:37,710
Gary Good,
which is a historical figure.

4144
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:38,693
It's like it's historical fact in the 
world of mixed martial arts than Mark 

4145
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:43,613
Schultz was like one of the greatest 
talents from wrestling to ever compete 

4146
02:40:46,141 --> 02:40:49,800
in MMA.
And Gary Goodrich was a real pioneer.

4147
02:40:49,990 --> 02:40:50,823
A guy was very dangerous and mark took 
them down at will and it was kind of 

4148
02:40:53,790 --> 02:40:57,030
crazy to watch like how good of a 
wrestler he was.

4149
02:40:57,230 --> 02:40:58,063
Well,
in the movie they bullshit their way 

4150
02:40:58,921 --> 02:40:59,580
through all that.

4151
02:40:59,580 --> 02:41:01,040
He didn't even fight.
Gary was there.

4152
02:41:01,230 --> 02:41:02,820
Was there somebody who served as a 
consultant,

4153
02:41:03,210 --> 02:41:04,043
who knows,
but mark went crazy after the movie's 

4154
02:41:05,190 --> 02:41:06,023
released and one of those twitter 
rampage and we were supposed to do a 

4155
02:41:08,131 --> 02:41:09,540
podcast about it.
But he's,

4156
02:41:09,990 --> 02:41:11,610
he's an odd guy,
you know,

4157
02:41:11,730 --> 02:41:12,690
he's just,
he's,

4158
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:15,720
he's very elusive and he's talked about 
doing it and I said,

4159
02:41:15,721 --> 02:41:16,980
look man,
let me know when you want to do it.

4160
02:41:16,981 --> 02:41:18,360
I'll fly you out.
We'll talk about it.

4161
02:41:18,361 --> 02:41:21,150
But he went on this rampage about it on 
twitter.

4162
02:41:21,151 --> 02:41:21,984
And then someone compiled a website 
where they talked about all the things 

4163
02:41:25,501 --> 02:41:26,334
that they got wrong in that movie and 
all this stuff they made up in that 

4164
02:41:28,651 --> 02:41:33,530
movie to make it more interesting.
But the story itself is fascinating that

4165
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:34,610
anytime,

4166
02:41:34,610 --> 02:41:36,450
but he releases a story or anybody,
uh,

4167
02:41:36,451 --> 02:41:38,120
you know,
signs over something or anybody,

4168
02:41:38,140 --> 02:41:39,810
you know,
it picks up a book and says,

4169
02:41:39,811 --> 02:41:41,100
I'm going to make a movie out of this.
And,

4170
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:42,860
and that's it.
It's,

4171
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:44,840
it becomes an editorial process.
It's like saying,

4172
02:41:44,841 --> 02:41:46,460
you know,
how does raw intelligence get out of the

4173
02:41:46,461 --> 02:41:48,260
field and then suddenly becomes 
something that's not,

4174
02:41:48,261 --> 02:41:49,094
well,
it gets into this editing process and 

4175
02:41:50,901 --> 02:41:52,700
you've got a bunch of people taking a 
whack at it,

4176
02:41:52,730 --> 02:41:53,563
you know,
over at the National Security Council 

4177
02:41:54,351 --> 02:41:55,700
and eventually,
you know,

4178
02:41:55,730 --> 02:41:56,930
they've got to spin on it.

4179
02:41:57,280 --> 02:42:00,190
I can kind of understand that.
If you're talking about someone who died

4180
02:42:00,191 --> 02:42:01,850
before things were recorded,
right?

4181
02:42:02,510 --> 02:42:05,200
Making a movie on Lincoln,
you don't really know what he said.

4182
02:42:05,201 --> 02:42:06,830
You've got to kind of put words in his 
mouth.

4183
02:42:06,840 --> 02:42:08,650
It's in a little bit.
What did he say to his wife?

4184
02:42:08,651 --> 02:42:10,060
Let's make up some shit.
He said to his wife,

4185
02:42:10,330 --> 02:42:11,163
but Lincoln's Lincoln's dead.
Mark Schultz is alive and he's not that 

4186
02:42:14,531 --> 02:42:15,610
old.
I mean he says,

4187
02:42:15,640 --> 02:42:17,740
I think he's probably 50 they talked to 
him about it.

4188
02:42:17,770 --> 02:42:18,603
Did they?
Oh yeah.

4189
02:42:18,610 --> 02:42:19,211
Well,
whatever.

4190
02:42:19,211 --> 02:42:20,044
They talked to him about it.
He fucking wasn't happy when the movie 

4191
02:42:21,971 --> 02:42:22,900
was released,
so I don't,

4192
02:42:22,901 --> 02:42:23,990
I don't know.
Right.

4193
02:42:24,310 --> 02:42:25,990
They made him look gang in the movie.
They made it.

4194
02:42:26,410 --> 02:42:29,110
They alluded to some sort of a weird gay
affair with him.

4195
02:42:29,111 --> 02:42:32,440
And Dupont.
It was frosted tips.

4196
02:42:32,700 --> 02:42:33,670
It was very odd.

4197
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:35,710
Very odd what they did.
I'm impressed.

4198
02:42:35,711 --> 02:42:37,760
You know what frosted tips are.
Oh,

4199
02:42:39,830 --> 02:42:41,010
they're out there.
So I was like,

4200
02:42:41,230 --> 02:42:42,670
I know a lot of things.
Strip club,

4201
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:44,560
no saying or his hair.
Yeah,

4202
02:42:44,650 --> 02:42:45,640
I know,
I know.

4203
02:42:45,730 --> 02:42:47,110
I know.
You know,

4204
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:50,260
we all know who hasn't had frost 10 we 
don't know.

4205
02:42:51,610 --> 02:42:53,050
I don't know what the hell that is.
Yeah,

4206
02:42:53,051 --> 02:42:54,790
when I had hair,
it's not about Camino.

4207
02:42:54,850 --> 02:42:57,790
I never had frosted tips,
but I could have,

4208
02:42:57,820 --> 02:42:59,770
I could have been talked in.
I've could have gotten to,

4209
02:42:59,771 --> 02:43:00,604
I've could have fallen into the wrong 
crowd of people in my twenties and I 

4210
02:43:02,771 --> 02:43:03,604
could've wound up in rocking tipsy after
that game at fenway and found a 

4211
02:43:07,271 --> 02:43:09,400
hairdresser upstairs,
do a hairdressers and said,

4212
02:43:09,401 --> 02:43:10,600
that's it.
That's for me.

4213
02:43:10,790 --> 02:43:12,220
Anybody saw the perfect guy

4214
02:43:12,220 --> 02:43:13,053
with frosted tips and it,
this would have been completely 

4215
02:43:14,651 --> 02:43:16,240
different conversation that you and me 
are having.

4216
02:43:16,241 --> 02:43:18,040
Right?
Ice Man from top gun,

4217
02:43:18,700 --> 02:43:21,340
Val Kilmer,
kilmer kilmer,

4218
02:43:21,610 --> 02:43:24,040
he's not looking as good as he did back 
in the top gun days.

4219
02:43:24,070 --> 02:43:24,903
He kind of slimmed down a little bit.
He got back to like a more manageable 

4220
02:43:27,941 --> 02:43:28,780
form.
Okay.

4221
02:43:28,810 --> 02:43:31,360
But for him,
he definitely shape.

4222
02:43:31,420 --> 02:43:33,510
He went,
he went full trump for awhile.

4223
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:36,550
He just ballooned up to this strange 
sort of,

4224
02:43:37,030 --> 02:43:39,580
that's odd because he was a fucking 
beautiful man.

4225
02:43:40,010 --> 02:43:43,450
That was alien movie and he did.
He did a tombstone.

4226
02:43:43,510 --> 02:43:47,140
There's the frosted tips.
Dad is nice man.

4227
02:43:48,510 --> 02:43:50,490
Fuck it in the air force were in that 
hairdo.

4228
02:43:50,800 --> 02:43:54,520
How does a guy go from that to,
have you ever seen that photo where it's

4229
02:43:54,521 --> 02:43:55,354
like lol?
I used to remember when I used to be 

4230
02:43:56,441 --> 02:43:57,820
Batman.
Ever seen that picture?

4231
02:43:58,510 --> 02:44:01,870
His fucking face looks like a giant pie.
Yeah.

4232
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:04,030
I saw him one time over at the Chateau 
Marmont.

4233
02:44:04,060 --> 02:44:04,893
I was sitting there,
uh,

4234
02:44:04,930 --> 02:44:05,763
working on my laptop and I look up and 
he's across the room and I thought 

4235
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:11,980
something familiar,
but it was during his,

4236
02:44:11,981 --> 02:44:14,650
a large stage.
I remember staring,

4237
02:44:14,651 --> 02:44:16,420
thinking there's something familiar 
about that dude.

4238
02:44:17,230 --> 02:44:19,120
And it took me forever to figure it out.
I finally,

4239
02:44:19,121 --> 02:44:20,800
I was about to close my laptop at that.
Aha.

4240
02:44:21,080 --> 02:44:21,821
It's,
it's a,

4241
02:44:21,821 --> 02:44:23,500
it's a huckleberry guy.
There he is.

4242
02:44:23,501 --> 02:44:25,360
Hey guys.
Remember when I was Batman.

4243
02:44:27,340 --> 02:44:31,450
What the fuck did he do this?
Does he just boozing it?

4244
02:44:31,590 --> 02:44:32,051
Oh,
nuts,

4245
02:44:32,051 --> 02:44:34,680
donuts and booze and bring a lot of 
people doubt.

4246
02:44:36,520 --> 02:44:37,930
Stop.
Stop doing this.

4247
02:44:37,931 --> 02:44:42,931
Spring up some pictures of the Camino.
He got so big belly up there.

4248
02:44:43,121 --> 02:44:44,170
Look at that one.
Go Up.

4249
02:44:44,380 --> 02:44:47,080
Look at that one right at his belly to 
the right.

4250
02:44:47,170 --> 02:44:49,930
Oh my Jesus Christ.
Stop turning that roll down.

4251
02:44:49,931 --> 02:44:50,980
I don't want that role.
Well,

4252
02:44:50,981 --> 02:44:52,770
actually look at his face there.
He's in the,

4253
02:44:52,771 --> 02:44:55,660
not as fat with its face as he was in 
that.

4254
02:44:55,661 --> 02:45:00,010
Remember when I was Batman?
He all by God Travolta.

4255
02:45:00,011 --> 02:45:00,940
Look,
they're a little bit,

4256
02:45:01,690 --> 02:45:03,070
what the Fuck,
man?

4257
02:45:03,270 --> 02:45:04,103
I wonder what he did.
We'll need to age better out in this 

4258
02:45:05,561 --> 02:45:06,880
town.
People need to age better.

4259
02:45:06,881 --> 02:45:09,130
They need to learn to age gracefully.
It's hard.

4260
02:45:09,310 --> 02:45:10,900
Well,
you know what the doctor just tells you,

4261
02:45:10,901 --> 02:45:12,430
hey man,
I'm just give you a little,

4262
02:45:12,600 --> 02:45:15,190
a little nip,
a little talk and we'll be fine.

4263
02:45:15,990 --> 02:45:18,550
Tell you what I'm talking about.
A slippery slope.

4264
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:21,080
Good looking man,
but thank you.

4265
02:45:21,350 --> 02:45:24,370
It a little better.
It gets some frosted tips and pull those

4266
02:45:24,371 --> 02:45:26,680
eyes up a little bit.
Just it's gonna make your mouth.

4267
02:45:26,681 --> 02:45:28,540
Sorry.
That's a weird one.

4268
02:45:28,780 --> 02:45:30,820
That's not a good one.
Make your mouth a little bigger.

4269
02:45:30,850 --> 02:45:31,683
That's the weird one that women develop 
this mouth that looks like they could 

4270
02:45:34,271 --> 02:45:35,240
eat your head.
Yeah.

4271
02:45:35,350 --> 02:45:40,120
There they're fucking choke her mouth 
because they're pulling your face and in

4272
02:45:40,121 --> 02:45:40,954
pulling your face they stretch.
They do something crazy where they're 

4273
02:45:43,691 --> 02:45:46,180
stretching your mouth.
They tightened the,

4274
02:45:46,181 --> 02:45:48,380
uh,
they tightened the Jina and they enlarge

4275
02:45:48,381 --> 02:45:50,650
the mouth and nothing wrong with Titan 
and China.

4276
02:45:50,740 --> 02:45:51,521
I know,
I guess I,

4277
02:45:51,521 --> 02:45:55,870
I just realized what I was saying.
I think that medical responsible mass,

4278
02:45:55,910 --> 02:45:57,540
yes.
Fight of a,

4279
02:45:57,550 --> 02:45:58,660
John,
I'd want to tighten.

4280
02:45:58,930 --> 02:45:59,763
I know this is exactly what people would
expect to us to be talking about when I 

4281
02:46:02,111 --> 02:46:04,570
come in on that afternoon on this 
podcast.

4282
02:46:04,571 --> 02:46:06,040
Yes.
Because this one guy,

4283
02:46:06,100 --> 02:46:09,040
this podcast will go south.
Well,

4284
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:09,980
we'll as

4285
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:12,440
well it has.
I think it might have.

4286
02:46:12,470 --> 02:46:13,950
I wanted to ask you one question before 
we get out.

4287
02:46:13,951 --> 02:46:14,784
I can get,
I think we're closing in on the three 

4288
02:46:15,591 --> 02:46:16,424
hour mark.
The interrogation school that you were 

4289
02:46:18,111 --> 02:46:18,944
talking about,
like what do they do to you when you're 

4290
02:46:20,330 --> 02:46:21,163
in an interrogation school to try to get
you to understand what it's like to 

4291
02:46:23,751 --> 02:46:24,584
break?
You'll have to talk about that to some 

4292
02:46:26,691 --> 02:46:27,380
degree.
Yeah.

4293
02:46:27,380 --> 02:46:30,440
I mean what you go through is a lot of 
what the waterboarding,

4294
02:46:30,441 --> 02:46:31,221
Nick's work.
So yeah.

4295
02:46:31,221 --> 02:46:32,890
I mean waterboarding has done to,
to,

4296
02:46:32,920 --> 02:46:33,830
to us,
to our people.

4297
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:36,590
So you've got waterboarded uh,
is anybody listening?

4298
02:46:36,660 --> 02:46:37,493
No.
Okay.

4299
02:46:37,970 --> 02:46:38,803
Just keep telling me that.
I keep imagining because we'll probably 

4300
02:46:41,301 --> 02:46:43,180
actually just recorded this.
You're just being nice to me there.

4301
02:46:43,181 --> 02:46:44,630
It actually,
you're not even recording it.

4302
02:46:44,631 --> 02:46:46,940
This is just happening and it's going to
go in the dump lot.

4303
02:46:47,090 --> 02:46:48,380
Yeah.
Anyway,

4304
02:46:48,710 --> 02:46:49,543
the point being is yes,
that enhanced interrogation techniques 

4305
02:46:52,401 --> 02:46:55,550
including sleep deprivation,
which is probably at the end of the day,

4306
02:46:55,880 --> 02:46:58,220
uh,
sleep deprivation,

4307
02:46:58,221 --> 02:47:00,170
white noise,
stress positions.

4308
02:47:00,980 --> 02:47:02,240
Um,
a,

4309
02:47:02,241 --> 02:47:05,870
an interrogation facility is a very,
uh,

4310
02:47:05,930 --> 02:47:08,210
finally controlled,
uh,

4311
02:47:08,810 --> 02:47:13,070
very labor intensive place.
And it's not like people think,

4312
02:47:13,090 --> 02:47:14,630
ah,
it's like a apple grape.

4313
02:47:14,631 --> 02:47:14,930
Well,
Abbott,

4314
02:47:14,930 --> 02:47:18,830
Greg wasn't an interrogation facility.
I have them grade was a military holding

4315
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:21,660
cell run by uh,
you know,

4316
02:47:21,730 --> 02:47:23,840
uh,
people that didn't have the experience,

4317
02:47:23,841 --> 02:47:24,674
they basically turned it over to junior 
officers and people that shouldn't have 

4318
02:47:26,781 --> 02:47:30,710
been in there running a facility like 
that and it was completely wrong.

4319
02:47:30,950 --> 02:47:34,700
But an interrogation facility,
you go in and it's,

4320
02:47:34,701 --> 02:47:37,370
it's,
it's all about doing your homework.

4321
02:47:37,520 --> 02:47:39,590
You don't ever go in and sit down with 
a,

4322
02:47:39,860 --> 02:47:43,460
a detainee unless you have done all your
homework.

4323
02:47:43,461 --> 02:47:45,470
You know where you want this 
conversation to go.

4324
02:47:45,470 --> 02:47:48,830
You know the questions you want to ask.
You don't want to appear to be wavering.

4325
02:47:48,831 --> 02:47:53,150
You didn't want to appear to be unsure.
And if you don't do your homework,

4326
02:47:53,180 --> 02:47:54,860
it's like a,
it's like a polygraph.

4327
02:47:54,890 --> 02:47:57,620
If the polygraph operator doesn't do his
homework,

4328
02:47:57,621 --> 02:47:58,454
lie detector,
if he doesn't do his homework and that 

4329
02:47:59,931 --> 02:48:02,120
exam is fucked,
do polygraphs work?

4330
02:48:02,540 --> 02:48:03,470
Uh,
you know what,

4331
02:48:03,620 --> 02:48:05,270
in a way,
it's not a science.

4332
02:48:05,330 --> 02:48:08,270
So it's not,
it doesn't work in the sense that yes,

4333
02:48:08,271 --> 02:48:09,104
it will tell if you're lying or not.
It's a tool in the kit bag of 

4334
02:48:12,021 --> 02:48:14,330
understanding what,
what kind of person you're dealing with.

4335
02:48:14,480 --> 02:48:17,810
So for some people it works because they
feel guilty about everything.

4336
02:48:17,830 --> 02:48:18,240
Right?
Right.

4337
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:19,073
And so they remember that in 1902 they 
stole a pen and now they feel bad about 

4338
02:48:23,031 --> 02:48:23,510
it.
So they're gonna,

4339
02:48:23,510 --> 02:48:25,070
you know,
and so the physical,

4340
02:48:25,080 --> 02:48:27,920
the physiology of it is,
it is starting to react.

4341
02:48:28,370 --> 02:48:30,230
And that allows for the operator to go,
well,

4342
02:48:30,231 --> 02:48:32,360
there's something strange about that 
question.

4343
02:48:32,361 --> 02:48:34,820
They reacted a little bit differently.
They're breathing,

4344
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:36,140
whatever it may be,
the sweat,

4345
02:48:36,170 --> 02:48:37,700
they how to react.
She had a reaction.

4346
02:48:37,701 --> 02:48:38,534
Now,
let's now let's go in on that a little 

4347
02:48:39,261 --> 02:48:41,360
bit,
but I guess my point being is that,

4348
02:48:41,361 --> 02:48:44,000
or interrogations or even negotiations 
or interviews,

4349
02:48:44,001 --> 02:48:44,890
I mean,
if you're out there and your,

4350
02:48:44,891 --> 02:48:46,550
your job is to interview people,
well then,

4351
02:48:46,820 --> 02:48:47,810
you know,
you know what it's like,

4352
02:48:47,811 --> 02:48:51,380
you gotta know who you're talking to and
that's how it becomes effective.

4353
02:48:51,381 --> 02:48:53,150
But in,
in training,

4354
02:48:53,180 --> 02:48:54,590
yeah.
You go through all these things,

4355
02:48:54,900 --> 02:48:56,900
um,
and it,

4356
02:48:56,910 --> 02:48:57,620
you know,
it can be,

4357
02:48:57,620 --> 02:48:59,990
it can be fairly intense.
But the idea,

4358
02:48:59,991 --> 02:49:01,610
again,
part of it is to show will look,

4359
02:49:01,611 --> 02:49:03,740
this is,
this is what it does.

4360
02:49:03,830 --> 02:49:05,930
This is how you can deal with it.

4361
02:49:06,290 --> 02:49:07,890
This is how you,
you know,

4362
02:49:07,891 --> 02:49:11,210
you stay close to some something that's 
um,

4363
02:49:11,960 --> 02:49:13,200
that's,
that's plausible.

4364
02:49:13,230 --> 02:49:13,830
You know,
it's like a,

4365
02:49:13,830 --> 02:49:15,590
it's like a,
an alias or a,

4366
02:49:15,591 --> 02:49:17,460
a backstory or whatever you want to call
it.

4367
02:49:17,850 --> 02:49:19,950
You don't want to treat it.
Try to keep it close to the truth.

4368
02:49:19,980 --> 02:49:20,813
You know,
the problem that people have in 

4369
02:49:21,570 --> 02:49:24,150
interrogation sometimes is they'll say 
something that's not true.

4370
02:49:24,151 --> 02:49:24,984
Now they got to remember that.
Then they go back in for another 

4371
02:49:26,911 --> 02:49:27,744
session.
They got to remember what they said 

4372
02:49:28,081 --> 02:49:29,520
before.
Now if they say another line,

4373
02:49:29,521 --> 02:49:30,354
now they've got to remember those two 
things and they was pretty soon after 

4374
02:49:32,040 --> 02:49:32,873
three or four interviews,
they're trying to remember this string 

4375
02:49:34,801 --> 02:49:35,634
of lies where what you really want to do
is you want to try to keep it as close 

4376
02:49:37,891 --> 02:49:42,891
as possible to whatever the truth may be
so that you don't have to spend all your

4377
02:49:43,261 --> 02:49:46,290
time struggling to remember what was the
hell I said last time.

4378
02:49:46,350 --> 02:49:47,183
So like,
if you lie to someone that you're 

4379
02:49:48,480 --> 02:49:50,250
interrogating,
that's you're saying,

4380
02:49:50,900 --> 02:49:52,550
not if someone's being interrogated or 
someone's,

4381
02:49:52,850 --> 02:49:54,330
I mean,
that's an or,

4382
02:49:54,331 --> 02:49:55,770
or you know,
in the interview process.

4383
02:49:55,771 --> 02:49:56,604
I mean,
it's just,

4384
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:57,201
so anyway,
I,

4385
02:49:57,201 --> 02:49:59,010
I don't know where I'm going with that 
other than to say that it's,

4386
02:49:59,340 --> 02:50:00,930
uh,
it's,

4387
02:50:01,140 --> 02:50:03,690
and whether it's military,
whether it's mild outfit or whomever,

4388
02:50:03,930 --> 02:50:05,550
um,
it's an important,

4389
02:50:05,700 --> 02:50:07,500
uh,
part of training because,

4390
02:50:07,550 --> 02:50:08,131
you know,
again,

4391
02:50:08,131 --> 02:50:09,660
you have to understand what's possible.
Now it's,

4392
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:11,160
it's a changed world,
right?

4393
02:50:11,161 --> 02:50:11,994
The Doj and the White House and 
everything came out and tortured people 

4394
02:50:14,511 --> 02:50:15,344
in the mall.
Well,

4395
02:50:15,360 --> 02:50:17,430
you can't use enhance techniques,
you know,

4396
02:50:17,431 --> 02:50:17,970
and,
and,

4397
02:50:17,970 --> 02:50:18,990
uh,
yeah.

4398
02:50:19,050 --> 02:50:20,720
So,
Hey,

4399
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:22,520
go and how people are screaming and 
sexy.

4400
02:50:22,610 --> 02:50:24,240
That's fucking torture until I your 
dope.

4401
02:50:24,390 --> 02:50:25,830
But I mean,
the idea of being is all you can use.

4402
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:28,320
This is the field manual,
the military field manual.

4403
02:50:28,340 --> 02:50:29,370
And what does that mean?
Well,

4404
02:50:29,371 --> 02:50:30,204
it means I couldn't break my,
my daughter with a military field 

4405
02:50:32,101 --> 02:50:32,911
manual.
You couldn't,

4406
02:50:32,911 --> 02:50:33,744
I don't think so.
What does the military field and what I 

4407
02:50:36,121 --> 02:50:37,320
mean by that is,
I don't mean to be,

4408
02:50:37,380 --> 02:50:41,700
uh,
I don't mean to be flip or dismissive.

4409
02:50:41,910 --> 02:50:42,743
What I'm saying is once,
once people out there know what can and 

4410
02:50:45,931 --> 02:50:48,540
can't be done,
they know how much they can take.

4411
02:50:48,570 --> 02:50:49,403
They know exactly what they can take,
they know what exactly what's coming 

4412
02:50:51,121 --> 02:50:53,550
down the pike and they're just going to 
keep their Yap shut.

4413
02:50:53,640 --> 02:50:54,271
And people say,
wow,

4414
02:50:54,271 --> 02:50:55,750
but you can develop a relationship with 
them.

4415
02:50:56,810 --> 02:50:58,020
That's what we did.
You know,

4416
02:50:58,021 --> 02:50:58,854
most of the time,
all the information we got basically if 

4417
02:51:00,241 --> 02:51:02,670
people took the time to go through Dlj 
memos and look at the,

4418
02:51:02,880 --> 02:51:03,713
the actual information,
most of what we did was based on 

4419
02:51:06,390 --> 02:51:09,000
conversing,
based on knowing who you're talking to,

4420
02:51:09,150 --> 02:51:12,570
doing your homework,
figuring out how the pieces fit together

4421
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:13,680
and talking to people.

4422
02:51:14,130 --> 02:51:14,963
Um,
but those people don't have much 

4423
02:51:16,441 --> 02:51:18,090
incentive to talk sometimes if they know
that,

4424
02:51:18,091 --> 02:51:19,560
well,
you can't do shit to him anyway.

4425
02:51:19,650 --> 02:51:20,483
Right.
And so I'll have to do is keep their 

4426
02:51:21,301 --> 02:51:24,320
mouth shut and you're,
you're saddled down by the rules.

4427
02:51:24,340 --> 02:51:26,250
The advantage of,
of,

4428
02:51:26,251 --> 02:51:27,570
uh,
enhanced techniques.

4429
02:51:27,571 --> 02:51:30,550
You should do air quotes when you say 
that it's tech.

4430
02:51:32,090 --> 02:51:33,540
And what I mean by that is,
yeah,

4431
02:51:33,541 --> 02:51:35,560
and it has techniques.
Let's see,

4432
02:51:35,570 --> 02:51:38,460
as a perfect representative.
I know.

4433
02:51:38,461 --> 02:51:38,911
And,
and you know,

4434
02:51:38,911 --> 02:51:40,200
and there you go.
And I know that was,

4435
02:51:40,560 --> 02:51:42,780
that's also,
it's like everything else,

4436
02:51:42,781 --> 02:51:43,614
right?
It's like the,

4437
02:51:43,920 --> 02:51:44,753
it's like all the other discussions 
we've been having in terms of people 

4438
02:51:47,551 --> 02:51:48,384
based on their experiences.
And so those people that you're never 

4439
02:51:49,921 --> 02:51:50,754
going to shift off this position.
You're not going to shift off of this 

4440
02:51:52,111 --> 02:51:55,260
other position.
It was all torture or it's not.

4441
02:51:55,260 --> 02:51:56,093
And there's some things that exist 
between talking to a detainee and what 

4442
02:51:58,591 --> 02:52:01,020
is torture?
The United States is noble when we don't

4443
02:52:01,021 --> 02:52:02,350
torture people.
Yeah.

4444
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:03,380
Well,
um,

4445
02:52:03,730 --> 02:52:04,920
yeah,
I want them to,

4446
02:52:05,140 --> 02:52:06,610
that we do.
I don't want to,

4447
02:52:06,790 --> 02:52:08,680
but I want them to not know what's in 
the kit bag.

4448
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:10,870
Okay.
So enhanced techniques.

4449
02:52:10,930 --> 02:52:12,460
So like when you say enhanced 
techniques,

4450
02:52:12,870 --> 02:52:15,370
is sleep deprivation and the enhanced 
techniques to sleep.

4451
02:52:15,371 --> 02:52:17,620
So you can't use that anymore.
What?

4452
02:52:17,710 --> 02:52:19,240
No.
What if you read,

4453
02:52:19,270 --> 02:52:20,410
read what,
what took place?

4454
02:52:20,620 --> 02:52:21,453
People read those deal memos and realize
how much it wouldn't take it if they 

4455
02:52:23,771 --> 02:52:24,604
actually took the time and understand 
all the back and forth that took place 

4456
02:52:28,031 --> 02:52:31,210
between the field and headquarters over 
at,

4457
02:52:31,211 --> 02:52:32,080
well,
can we do this?

4458
02:52:32,081 --> 02:52:35,050
Can I put my hand on his chest and push 
him up against a wall?

4459
02:52:35,051 --> 02:52:35,801
Well,
okay,

4460
02:52:35,801 --> 02:52:36,610
build a fake wall.

4461
02:52:36,610 --> 02:52:38,230
So it's not like,
can you do this?

4462
02:52:38,231 --> 02:52:38,651
Okay,
no,

4463
02:52:38,651 --> 02:52:40,060
can I,
what can I do?

4464
02:52:40,061 --> 02:52:40,894
And there was back and forth and back 
and forth over what could be done and 

4465
02:52:43,720 --> 02:52:44,350
yeah,
okay.

4466
02:52:44,350 --> 02:52:47,110
It's not supposed to be nice and it's 
not pleasant.

4467
02:52:47,111 --> 02:52:49,600
And we can argue and I,
and obviously people do,

4468
02:52:49,601 --> 02:52:52,000
I don't,
torture is wrong and we shouldn't do it,

4469
02:52:52,210 --> 02:52:53,043
but do I think that there were some 
things like a sleep deprivation or 

4470
02:52:54,911 --> 02:52:58,600
stress positions or truck noise,
you know,

4471
02:52:58,620 --> 02:52:59,320
like,
uh,

4472
02:52:59,320 --> 02:53:01,090
put your forward against the wall and 
walk back,

4473
02:53:01,420 --> 02:53:02,250
you know,
and then,

4474
02:53:02,250 --> 02:53:04,270
you know,
lean,

4475
02:53:05,290 --> 02:53:08,240
lean your head against the wall and walk
back and,

4476
02:53:08,250 --> 02:53:10,030
and stay in that position for,
you know,

4477
02:53:10,330 --> 02:53:12,400
15 minutes or whatever.
You make them do that.

4478
02:53:13,120 --> 02:53:15,160
Uh,
what if they don't in the old days?

4479
02:53:15,480 --> 02:53:16,000
Yes.
Yeah.

4480
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:16,570
I mean,
you know,

4481
02:53:16,570 --> 02:53:17,403
people are pretty compliant in an 
interrogation facility back when they 

4482
02:53:19,211 --> 02:53:20,950
didn't know what was coming down the 
pike.

4483
02:53:21,180 --> 02:53:22,013
Right.
And that's why I keep saying the same 

4484
02:53:22,901 --> 02:53:23,590
thing.
I don't,

4485
02:53:23,590 --> 02:53:26,050
I don't,
I agree it shouldn't be torturing,

4486
02:53:26,051 --> 02:53:26,884
but at the same time,
we shouldn't also be telling the 

4487
02:53:28,211 --> 02:53:30,340
hostiles what we can and can't do.
All right.

4488
02:53:30,370 --> 02:53:31,203
You say you shouldn't be torturing,
but what if you have someone who knows 

4489
02:53:34,091 --> 02:53:38,230
that a nine 11 is about to take place 
and you've got to get information out of

4490
02:53:38,231 --> 02:53:40,120
them.
What other ways are there?

4491
02:53:40,150 --> 02:53:40,983
If you have a small window of time?
It's not really the unsatisfactory 

4492
02:53:44,420 --> 02:53:45,221
answers.
There's not really,

4493
02:53:45,221 --> 02:53:46,900
torture doesn't really put through this 
information.

4494
02:53:46,901 --> 02:53:47,734
I agree with Senator Mccain and lots of 
other people about that people will say 

4495
02:53:51,670 --> 02:53:52,503
whatever they need to say to make 
whatever that horrible torture is to 

4496
02:53:54,881 --> 02:53:56,860
stop.
And so it's not from an operational,

4497
02:53:56,861 --> 02:53:57,161
I,
you know,

4498
02:53:57,161 --> 02:53:57,994
again,
I understand that some moral aspect to 

4499
02:53:59,381 --> 02:54:00,214
it.
I tend to just look at things from an 

4500
02:54:00,671 --> 02:54:02,320
operational efficiency point of view.

4501
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:04,240
And it's not good.
You can't,

4502
02:54:04,260 --> 02:54:05,093
you can't count on information.
So beating somebody up doesn't get 

4503
02:54:06,971 --> 02:54:10,420
information off their fingers,
doesn't get information out of them,

4504
02:54:10,570 --> 02:54:12,790
but does sleep not that,
not that are not,

4505
02:54:12,791 --> 02:54:14,310
that are hostile is out there and not 
to.

4506
02:54:14,311 --> 02:54:16,180
The people that are after us wouldn't do
the same.

4507
02:54:16,240 --> 02:54:17,073
Of course they do that,
but they're not really after accurate 

4508
02:54:19,211 --> 02:54:20,170
information.
They don't care.

4509
02:54:20,171 --> 02:54:21,004
It's a different,
it's a different world that they 

4510
02:54:21,670 --> 02:54:22,503
existed.
If we're after actionable intelligence 

4511
02:54:23,951 --> 02:54:26,260
that you can count on,
then it's just a very,

4512
02:54:26,261 --> 02:54:28,420
very labor intensive sources.
Well,

4513
02:54:28,460 --> 02:54:30,850
there there's ways to get people to 
talk,

4514
02:54:30,851 --> 02:54:32,560
right?
Well,

4515
02:54:32,561 --> 02:54:33,394
yeah,
I mean this gets to a point 

4516
02:54:34,330 --> 02:54:35,680
psychologically speaking.
Sure.

4517
02:54:35,681 --> 02:54:37,750
I mean there's ways to get them to 
comply,

4518
02:54:37,751 --> 02:54:39,700
get them and that's,
that's part of the processes,

4519
02:54:39,880 --> 02:54:40,630
you know,
uh,

4520
02:54:40,630 --> 02:54:42,820
in a well controlled environment,
sleep deprivation or,

4521
02:54:42,821 --> 02:54:44,290
or,
or a white noise.

4522
02:54:44,950 --> 02:54:45,783
How do you keep them awake?
What do you have to do for sleep 

4523
02:54:46,841 --> 02:54:47,970
deprivation?
Ah,

4524
02:54:48,010 --> 02:54:49,810
you keep him standing or you,
uh,

4525
02:54:49,811 --> 02:54:50,644
you know,
keep moving them from place to place or 

4526
02:54:51,800 --> 02:54:54,490
you pump in some,
uh,

4527
02:54:54,670 --> 02:54:55,503
you know,
Arabic music or a baby crying or 

4528
02:54:56,981 --> 02:54:58,750
whatever it may be.
Um,

4529
02:54:58,840 --> 02:55:00,880
and it just keeps them awake.
I mean,

4530
02:55:00,881 --> 02:55:01,301
it's,
again,

4531
02:55:01,301 --> 02:55:02,980
it's labor intensive because you got to 
keep checking on them,

4532
02:55:02,990 --> 02:55:03,823
making sure they're awakening.
But you do that in under a controlled 

4533
02:55:05,271 --> 02:55:05,911
environment.
You don't,

4534
02:55:05,911 --> 02:55:06,260
you don't,
you know,

4535
02:55:06,260 --> 02:55:07,610
we're not talking about,
you know,

4536
02:55:07,640 --> 02:55:09,040
five days of this.
And,

4537
02:55:09,410 --> 02:55:11,270
and again,
if people took the time to understand or

4538
02:55:11,271 --> 02:55:12,104
read,
they would realize that we're a lot of 

4539
02:55:13,430 --> 02:55:15,440
doctors,
psychiatrists involved that were saying,

4540
02:55:15,441 --> 02:55:15,921
yeah,
you can,

4541
02:55:15,921 --> 02:55:17,770
or you can't do this.
Um,

4542
02:55:18,230 --> 02:55:19,760
it wasn't,
you know,

4543
02:55:20,750 --> 02:55:21,491
I,
again,

4544
02:55:21,491 --> 02:55:21,861
I,
I,

4545
02:55:21,861 --> 02:55:22,694
you know,
I get conflicted because I understand 

4546
02:55:23,991 --> 02:55:26,510
why people are so emotive about it and I
get that.

4547
02:55:26,900 --> 02:55:28,820
Um,
and I do agree there's,

4548
02:55:28,970 --> 02:55:30,910
uh,
you know,

4549
02:55:31,100 --> 02:55:34,820
you have to look at what you can and 
can't do and you have to be very,

4550
02:55:34,821 --> 02:55:37,130
very critical about that.
And you have to be very careful.

4551
02:55:37,131 --> 02:55:40,340
But I guess I keep coming back to the 
same thing as we've kind of given up the

4552
02:55:40,341 --> 02:55:41,174
ghost from now on going forward.
Everybody out there knows what we can 

4553
02:55:45,021 --> 02:55:47,600
and can't do.
And so whether we were going to do it or

4554
02:55:47,601 --> 02:55:48,434
not,
which we wore in terms of the torture 

4555
02:55:49,461 --> 02:55:51,650
side of things,
they didn't know that.

4556
02:55:51,800 --> 02:55:52,633
And so you could speed the process up of
getting them to comply to some degree 

4557
02:55:56,181 --> 02:55:57,014
because they didn't know what was coming
down the pike and you keep them on the 

4558
02:55:58,581 --> 02:56:02,440
back foot and you keep them guessing.
And that's your advantage in a,

4559
02:56:02,630 --> 02:56:04,700
in a,
in a situation like that.

4560
02:56:04,701 --> 02:56:05,930
So,
um,

4561
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:07,580
but yeah,
I again,

4562
02:56:07,670 --> 02:56:08,990
I keep going back to the same thing.

4563
02:56:08,990 --> 02:56:11,180
I get it.
I understand why people are so,

4564
02:56:11,740 --> 02:56:12,860
uh,
you know,

4565
02:56:12,920 --> 02:56:13,880
and,
and to be fair,

4566
02:56:13,890 --> 02:56:16,760
the left really did a great job of 
framing the argument.

4567
02:56:16,910 --> 02:56:18,290
You know,
they really took it and said,

4568
02:56:18,360 --> 02:56:20,390
you're either talking to somebody or 
it's all torture.

4569
02:56:20,600 --> 02:56:21,433
Well,
if torture doesn't really produce 

4570
02:56:23,121 --> 02:56:23,954
actionable information,
then it makes sense to not torture 

4571
02:56:25,581 --> 02:56:26,060
people.
Right.

4572
02:56:26,060 --> 02:56:27,470
Absolutely.
That's my point.

4573
02:56:28,250 --> 02:56:29,083
That's my point.
And I agree from ecstasy and hookers 

4574
02:56:31,430 --> 02:56:32,131
either.
No,

4575
02:56:32,131 --> 02:56:32,964
it's not.
It's not supposed to be a pleasant 

4576
02:56:34,761 --> 02:56:36,060
situation.
And so people say,

4577
02:56:36,061 --> 02:56:36,920
well,
I can't believe you would,

4578
02:56:36,921 --> 02:56:37,530
uh,
you know,

4579
02:56:37,530 --> 02:56:39,110
put somebody in a stress position or you
would,

4580
02:56:39,250 --> 02:56:40,083
you know,
make them uncomfortable or you would 

4581
02:56:40,911 --> 02:56:43,870
keep them awake for 36 hours.
I can't believe you would do.

4582
02:56:43,880 --> 02:56:44,900
Well,
really,

4583
02:56:45,020 --> 02:56:46,190
I mean,
what the fuck you want to,

4584
02:56:46,191 --> 02:56:47,210
of course.
And we'd always try,

4585
02:56:47,211 --> 02:56:48,044
you'd always try to develop 
relationships with people that is in 

4586
02:56:49,521 --> 02:56:50,900
fact the best way to do it.

4587
02:56:50,900 --> 02:56:52,360
Develop,
try to Pry,

4588
02:56:52,370 --> 02:56:54,680
you know,
find out about their psychology.

4589
02:56:54,681 --> 02:56:55,514
Try to find ways to get them on side to,
to get their sympathy or to bring them 

4590
02:57:00,081 --> 02:57:01,460
on board.
Whatever you can do.

4591
02:57:01,490 --> 02:57:04,400
But um,
to just say we're taking all these other

4592
02:57:04,401 --> 02:57:07,130
things out of the kit bag,
whether we ever gonna use them or not.

4593
02:57:07,520 --> 02:57:08,353
And here's all we can do.
You're pretty much guaranteed that 

4594
02:57:11,271 --> 02:57:15,170
there's a lot of people out there who 
are walking around on Syria and Iraq for

4595
02:57:15,171 --> 02:57:19,520
Isis carrying a field manual in their 
back pocket who know exactly what we can

4596
02:57:19,521 --> 02:57:20,360
do.
What we can't do now,

4597
02:57:20,460 --> 02:57:24,450
but isn't there a ways we circumvent 
that by not doing it on American soil?

4598
02:57:24,510 --> 02:57:25,400
No,
no,

4599
02:57:25,430 --> 02:57:26,040
no,
no,

4600
02:57:26,040 --> 02:57:27,690
no.
I know people would like to think that.

4601
02:57:27,691 --> 02:57:28,524
I like to think that there's like some 
secret CIA holding place that you take 

4602
02:57:31,171 --> 02:57:32,004
people on the moon of question get stick
rockets up the ass and they start 

4603
02:57:34,381 --> 02:57:35,280
talking.
I'm moon.

4604
02:57:35,460 --> 02:57:38,490
That would be you gotta be sign.
That'd be a lot of money.

4605
02:57:38,580 --> 02:57:40,750
Too much money on moon station.
Um,

4606
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,530
no,
like one Tahmo for for instance,

4607
02:57:43,531 --> 02:57:46,470
like a lot of dark shit has gone on and 
Guantanamo,

4608
02:57:46,471 --> 02:57:46,810
right?

4609
02:57:46,810 --> 02:57:48,430
Um,
no,

4610
02:57:48,431 --> 02:57:49,264
actually,
you know what,

4611
02:57:50,240 --> 02:57:51,580
here's where people will say,
ah,

4612
02:57:51,581 --> 02:57:52,930
I can't believe it.
Uh,

4613
02:57:53,020 --> 02:57:54,680
Watada Mo,
uh,

4614
02:57:54,730 --> 02:57:57,230
has always been more about,
um,

4615
02:57:57,290 --> 02:57:59,140
uh,
a holding facility.

4616
02:57:59,470 --> 02:58:02,220
And you could argue that though the,
the,

4617
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:04,410
depending on how you want to frame it,
if you want to say it was all torture,

4618
02:58:04,411 --> 02:58:05,244
fine,
then the torture or the enhanced 

4619
02:58:06,151 --> 02:58:06,984
techniques,
whatever,

4620
02:58:06,990 --> 02:58:10,410
uh,
for the most part took place overseas in

4621
02:58:10,670 --> 02:58:11,940
a facilities that,
you know,

4622
02:58:12,050 --> 02:58:15,450
we were running that were temporary or 
our host countries were running.

4623
02:58:15,690 --> 02:58:18,150
And that's where I would much rather 
have,

4624
02:58:18,300 --> 02:58:21,840
we treat people a lot better than some 
of our allies do,

4625
02:58:21,930 --> 02:58:22,763
frankly.
And particularly a lot of our Middle 

4626
02:58:24,450 --> 02:58:25,283
Eastern allies.
I could only imagine there are a lot of 

4627
02:58:26,911 --> 02:58:27,870
guys in,
in,

4628
02:58:27,871 --> 02:58:30,840
in Guantanamo who would like to stay in 
Guantanamo right now,

4629
02:58:30,841 --> 02:58:32,270
frankly.
Um,

4630
02:58:32,310 --> 02:58:37,310
then go be repatriated to the Middle 
East and really?

4631
02:58:37,380 --> 02:58:38,160
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

4632
02:58:38,160 --> 02:58:38,993
you're kidding me.
Rather than if that didn't go back and 

4633
02:58:40,201 --> 02:58:42,180
face a Egyptian justice.
Yeah.

4634
02:58:42,230 --> 02:58:43,530
Or,
or the Jordanians are.

4635
02:58:43,531 --> 02:58:44,480
Yeah,
absolutely.

4636
02:58:44,910 --> 02:58:45,960
But I mean,
I again,

4637
02:58:46,020 --> 02:58:47,100
I know people are going to say,
well,

4638
02:58:47,101 --> 02:58:49,320
they don't actually want it.
They're not clamoring to stay and get my

4639
02:58:49,321 --> 02:58:50,154
dog get me wrong.
I'm saying that they are treated better 

4640
02:58:52,530 --> 02:58:54,360
in that facility.
Then they would be,

4641
02:58:54,510 --> 02:58:56,940
if they find themselves suddenly in an 
Egyptian prison,

4642
02:58:56,970 --> 02:58:59,030
if they were interrogated by our allies.
So,

4643
02:58:59,070 --> 02:58:59,903
but having,
there've been people that have been 

4644
02:59:00,811 --> 02:59:03,270
found to have been detained there that 
really were innocent.

4645
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:06,150
Let's put it this way.
Uh,

4646
02:59:06,780 --> 02:59:07,613
did we throw out a big net and uh,
err on the side of caution when we were 

4647
02:59:12,181 --> 02:59:14,970
picking people up off the battlefield?
Yes.

4648
02:59:15,710 --> 02:59:16,543
Um,
did we do a lot of good by removing a 

4649
02:59:21,121 --> 02:59:21,954
lot of these people and some of the key 
players off the battlefield and out of 

4650
02:59:24,211 --> 02:59:27,870
the operational system within al Qaeda 
and some of their,

4651
02:59:27,871 --> 02:59:28,980
their supporting elements.

4652
02:59:29,010 --> 02:59:31,530
Yes.
So it's not,

4653
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:32,753
you know,
it's not satisfying answer because it's 

4654
02:59:33,631 --> 02:59:35,550
not black or white.
It's not all bad.

4655
02:59:35,580 --> 02:59:36,930
It's not all good.
Again,

4656
02:59:36,931 --> 02:59:38,850
like we were talking about before,
the gray,

4657
02:59:38,910 --> 02:59:40,620
it's the gray.
It's unfortunate,

4658
02:59:40,621 --> 02:59:42,430
but a part of reality.
It's the way that,

4659
02:59:42,450 --> 02:59:43,140
you know,
I don't know.

4660
02:59:43,140 --> 02:59:44,280
And you know,
and yes.

4661
02:59:44,281 --> 02:59:45,570
What are you going to do it?
Close it down and say,

4662
02:59:45,571 --> 02:59:46,260
well,
we're sorry.

4663
02:59:46,260 --> 02:59:48,990
The recidivism rate for people coming 
out of a Gizmo is,

4664
02:59:48,991 --> 02:59:51,800
is up in the 30% outright.
It's,

4665
02:59:51,801 --> 02:59:53,250
it's,
it's a third plus.

4666
02:59:53,730 --> 02:59:58,730
And will you actually going to get my,
would probably encourage them to want to

4667
02:59:59,190 --> 03:00:00,750
fucking hate America more.
Well,

4668
03:00:00,751 --> 03:00:01,584
you wouldn't.
Yeah,

4669
03:00:01,770 --> 03:00:02,603
I got,
no,

4670
03:00:02,960 --> 03:00:03,793
don't probably that.
I think that's probably a fair 

4671
03:00:04,981 --> 03:00:06,400
statement.
Um,

4672
03:00:06,570 --> 03:00:07,403
do I want them back out on the 
battlefield looking to kill us or our 

4673
03:00:09,211 --> 03:00:10,500
allies?
Uh,

4674
03:00:10,530 --> 03:00:11,010
no.

4675
03:00:11,010 --> 03:00:11,843
I think we,
you know,

4676
03:00:12,420 --> 03:00:14,440
but again,
you know,

4677
03:00:14,540 --> 03:00:16,740
what's the answer?
What's the area we've got to close Gitmo

4678
03:00:16,770 --> 03:00:17,460
and bring,
you know,

4679
03:00:17,460 --> 03:00:21,450
the 46 or so that we're never going to 
repatriate over to us soil.

4680
03:00:22,350 --> 03:00:22,971
Who knows?
I mean,

4681
03:00:22,971 --> 03:00:23,804
as a president gets his way,
I don't think he's going to get passed 

4682
03:00:24,780 --> 03:00:26,580
congress,
but it,

4683
03:00:26,610 --> 03:00:28,070
again,
it's one of those things down,

4684
03:00:28,071 --> 03:00:28,904
right?
He wants to close it down and this is 

4685
03:00:30,030 --> 03:00:33,300
probably want to do with this 46 people 
that are being told is 91 there.

4686
03:00:33,301 --> 03:00:37,650
But by the time you get to the ones that
just aren't going to find at home,

4687
03:00:38,070 --> 03:00:38,410
I mean,
look,

4688
03:00:38,410 --> 03:00:40,590
the Bishop Bush administration and the 
Obama Administration,

4689
03:00:40,591 --> 03:00:42,900
we've spent years and years trying to 
find places for these people.

4690
03:00:42,901 --> 03:00:43,980
It's not like anybody,
you know,

4691
03:00:44,130 --> 03:00:46,950
didn't want to try to get these people 
sent somewhere else.

4692
03:00:47,010 --> 03:00:47,843
That's been a goal of,
of this administration and the previous 

4693
03:00:49,441 --> 03:00:53,190
one and it just some folks who just 
aren't going to find another home.

4694
03:00:53,220 --> 03:00:55,320
So there's about 45,
46 of them.

4695
03:00:55,710 --> 03:00:58,320
And the idea of being,
bring them back to the states,

4696
03:00:58,321 --> 03:00:59,154
I guess,

4697
03:01:00,520 --> 03:01:01,353
how do they catch these people?
And then it's all various different 

4698
03:01:03,791 --> 03:01:04,370
ways.
Right,

4699
03:01:04,370 --> 03:01:04,580
right,

4700
03:01:04,580 --> 03:01:05,240
right.
And,

4701
03:01:05,240 --> 03:01:05,931
and that,
that was,

4702
03:01:05,931 --> 03:01:07,190
I was old days.
You don't,

4703
03:01:07,220 --> 03:01:08,810
you don't,
you don't hear us talking about catching

4704
03:01:08,811 --> 03:01:09,644
a lot of people anymore.
And part of the reason why it's because 

4705
03:01:11,990 --> 03:01:12,823
you'd rather just paint that target and,
and blow the fuck out of him then risk 

4706
03:01:16,521 --> 03:01:18,410
your career,
uh,

4707
03:01:18,440 --> 03:01:20,640
picking up somebody and then getting 
accused of,

4708
03:01:20,641 --> 03:01:21,590
of,
you know,

4709
03:01:21,591 --> 03:01:24,050
mishandling a detainee,
um,

4710
03:01:24,260 --> 03:01:25,093
or,
or all the crap that can happen because 

4711
03:01:26,511 --> 03:01:28,250
suddenly they've decided,
you know,

4712
03:01:28,251 --> 03:01:29,084
a program for capturing somebody and 
bringing them back to go autonomo 

4713
03:01:32,190 --> 03:01:35,870
wherever is not appropriate.
So what you've found over the years,

4714
03:01:35,871 --> 03:01:40,700
recent past is it's a lot easier to just
smoke them then to pick them up.

4715
03:01:41,060 --> 03:01:42,050
I hate to say that.
I mean that's a,

4716
03:01:42,051 --> 03:01:43,580
that's a,
that's a sad thing to say.

4717
03:01:43,581 --> 03:01:44,414
But that's,
and so what does that mean from an 

4718
03:01:45,441 --> 03:01:47,180
operationally efficient point of view?

4719
03:01:47,390 --> 03:01:51,140
That means your pipeline of potential 
intelligence is drying up because you're

4720
03:01:51,141 --> 03:01:53,270
not,
you're not picking these people up live.

4721
03:01:53,480 --> 03:01:54,710
It's just easier to,
to,

4722
03:01:54,730 --> 03:01:57,230
to whack them.
So it was a harsh reality.

4723
03:01:57,500 --> 03:01:57,930
Well,
it's,

4724
03:01:57,930 --> 03:02:00,830
it's part of the way it's part of the 
way it works.

4725
03:02:00,920 --> 03:02:01,753
Nobody wants to,
everybody was getting their ass kicked 

4726
03:02:02,960 --> 03:02:03,890
for being,
you know,

4727
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:05,680
involved in,
uh,

4728
03:02:05,750 --> 03:02:07,160
a,
uh,

4729
03:02:07,161 --> 03:02:07,994
approved program of whether it was 
rendition or the interrogation program 

4730
03:02:11,481 --> 03:02:11,901
or,
you know,

4731
03:02:11,901 --> 03:02:13,790
whatever as part of that or the 
periphery.

4732
03:02:14,120 --> 03:02:15,980
And,
you know,

4733
03:02:16,220 --> 03:02:18,050
people look at the,
the drone program and think,

4734
03:02:18,051 --> 03:02:19,790
wow,
that's really expanded under Obama.

4735
03:02:19,791 --> 03:02:20,480
Well,
no shit,

4736
03:02:20,480 --> 03:02:22,570
because it's just,
you know,

4737
03:02:22,580 --> 03:02:23,420
just take 'em out

4738
03:02:23,990 --> 03:02:24,823
the heartburn.
So that's why the drone program has 

4739
03:02:26,811 --> 03:02:30,490
expanded because capturing detainees,
administration,

4740
03:02:31,070 --> 03:02:33,500
administration wants more people to put 
in Guantanamo.

4741
03:02:33,620 --> 03:02:34,453
Isn't that fucked up?
That it's easier to kill someone 

4742
03:02:36,141 --> 03:02:38,840
politically,
like to have civilian casualties and the

4743
03:02:38,900 --> 03:02:41,240
civilian casualties are pretty fucking 
high with drones,

4744
03:02:41,241 --> 03:02:42,074
right?

4745
03:02:42,150 --> 03:02:42,930
Well,
uh,

4746
03:02:42,930 --> 03:02:43,600
yeah,
I mean this,

4747
03:02:43,600 --> 03:02:46,050
again under the theory that nothing's 
going to be perfect.

4748
03:02:46,051 --> 03:02:48,480
They try everything they can to limit 
that.

4749
03:02:48,570 --> 03:02:49,403
But yeah,
of course there've been civilian 

4750
03:02:50,101 --> 03:02:51,330
casualties,
no doubt about that.

4751
03:02:51,331 --> 03:02:53,760
But then it's something crazy like 80%.
No,

4752
03:02:53,790 --> 03:02:54,690
no,
it's not that high.

4753
03:02:54,691 --> 03:02:55,710
It's,
it's,

4754
03:02:55,750 --> 03:02:58,080
you could argue even once too high.
Right.

4755
03:02:58,081 --> 03:02:59,640
I mean it,
but it's not,

4756
03:02:59,690 --> 03:03:00,630
you know,
again,

4757
03:03:00,631 --> 03:03:01,470
once again,
the same thing.

4758
03:03:01,560 --> 03:03:04,830
Numbers get thrown out on one side.
So it's not a,

4759
03:03:05,030 --> 03:03:06,340
it's not zero.
It's,

4760
03:03:06,450 --> 03:03:07,440
we've had,
we've had,

4761
03:03:07,730 --> 03:03:09,360
uh,
we've had unfortunate instance,

4762
03:03:09,361 --> 03:03:11,250
there's no doubt about that.
And like I said,

4763
03:03:11,251 --> 03:03:13,140
one is too many,
but at the same time,

4764
03:03:13,141 --> 03:03:15,510
I guess my point being is the drone 
programs expanded,

4765
03:03:16,370 --> 03:03:17,203
um,
in part because it's perceived as a 

4766
03:03:22,830 --> 03:03:25,380
cleaner,
which sounds awful.

4767
03:03:25,630 --> 03:03:28,440
And it is awful because again,
from an operational perspective,

4768
03:03:28,441 --> 03:03:31,260
I'd rather have my hands on that 
detainee to know what they know.

4769
03:03:32,070 --> 03:03:33,870
And once you smoke them,
you're not going to know that shit.

4770
03:03:33,930 --> 03:03:34,680
So what

4771
03:03:34,680 --> 03:03:37,680
if they come up with a way one day to 
actually,

4772
03:03:37,681 --> 03:03:39,970
I mean,
I know that they have something called f

4773
03:03:39,980 --> 03:03:43,560
Mri,
functional magnetic resonance imagery,

4774
03:03:43,561 --> 03:03:46,110
I think it's called,
where they've used it.

4775
03:03:46,170 --> 03:03:47,003
I believe in India it was a real 
problematic case because they convicted 

4776
03:03:51,661 --> 03:03:52,494
someone for murder because they had 
functional knowledge of the crime and 

4777
03:03:56,341 --> 03:03:59,690
people who I talked to this 
neuroscientist who was,

4778
03:03:59,780 --> 03:04:03,950
she was kind of an expert in Fmr I and 
she said that's a huge,

4779
03:04:03,980 --> 03:04:04,813
there's a huge problem with them that 
would never fly in the United States 

4780
03:04:06,471 --> 03:04:07,304
because functional,
functional knowledge of the crime could 

4781
03:04:10,881 --> 03:04:14,660
have been established through her 
interrogation process,

4782
03:04:14,900 --> 03:04:18,170
through questioning,
through asking her about the case.

4783
03:04:18,290 --> 03:04:20,450
She could have functional knowledge of 
the crime scene.

4784
03:04:20,900 --> 03:04:23,960
So like proving it through an Fmri she's
like,

4785
03:04:23,970 --> 03:04:25,460
is not,
it doesn't work.

4786
03:04:25,461 --> 03:04:26,294
So what they're convicting someone on is
something that would never fly in 

4787
03:04:28,851 --> 03:04:30,650
America.
But what if they could,

4788
03:04:30,680 --> 03:04:33,020
if they could one day figure out a way

4789
03:04:34,490 --> 03:04:35,323
that one's like minority report or 
whatever that movie was with Val kilmer 

4790
03:04:37,970 --> 03:04:39,340
before he gained weight?
No,

4791
03:04:39,350 --> 03:04:41,000
I was Tom Cruise.
Same Guy.

4792
03:04:41,030 --> 03:04:41,863
Yeah.
Yeah.

4793
03:04:41,870 --> 03:04:44,810
They think it's the same one.
We never seen him photograph together.

4794
03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:47,420
You don't even notice that.
It's like Yasser Arafat and Ringo Starr.

4795
03:04:47,450 --> 03:04:49,040
I think you were in a movie together,
man.

4796
03:04:49,190 --> 03:04:51,080
They weren't top gun.
Of course they weren't.

4797
03:04:51,130 --> 03:04:53,270
But what am I talking about?
I forgot.

4798
03:04:53,271 --> 03:04:53,681
I was,
I,

4799
03:04:53,681 --> 03:04:57,520
I had my memory wiped clean by seeing a 
deicing fat val kilmer.

4800
03:05:00,800 --> 03:05:01,640
Oh,
well,

4801
03:05:01,700 --> 03:05:03,440
uh,
you know what I got to tell you this has

4802
03:05:03,441 --> 03:05:07,670
been,
I'm sure the viewers are tired of it,

4803
03:05:07,671 --> 03:05:08,510
but I've had a great time.

4804
03:05:08,920 --> 03:05:09,753
Great.
John to thank you very much for doing 

4805
03:05:10,510 --> 03:05:11,950
this.
I really appreciate your,

4806
03:05:12,200 --> 03:05:14,500
your candor and your openness and,
you know,

4807
03:05:14,501 --> 03:05:17,710
exploring some uncomfortable and 
difficult subjects and uh,

4808
03:05:17,711 --> 03:05:18,544
and given us some inside information 
that it's very difficult for people to 

4809
03:05:21,431 --> 03:05:24,340
get any other way unless they're talking
to a guy like you.

4810
03:05:24,341 --> 03:05:25,174
It's a lot of it is speculation and,
and bullshit and posturing and reading 

4811
03:05:29,351 --> 03:05:31,480
websites.
It might be completely inaccurate.

4812
03:05:31,481 --> 03:05:32,890
So I think you've,
you've,

4813
03:05:32,920 --> 03:05:33,790
you've helped us a lot.

4814
03:05:33,820 --> 03:05:34,890
Well,
I really appreciate,

4815
03:05:34,900 --> 03:05:37,330
I just encourage everybody,
just read everything you can.

4816
03:05:37,331 --> 03:05:38,164
Don't,
don't settle on one source of 

4817
03:05:38,681 --> 03:05:39,461
information,
right?

4818
03:05:39,461 --> 03:05:40,690
I mean,
that's the right and the left.

4819
03:05:40,691 --> 03:05:42,880
Make that mistake again.
You know,

4820
03:05:42,881 --> 03:05:43,220
we're,
we're,

4821
03:05:43,220 --> 03:05:44,053
we're,
we're getting to a point where it's 

4822
03:05:44,411 --> 03:05:45,430
pretty fucked up,
right?

4823
03:05:45,431 --> 03:05:50,350
We've got to find a way to get back to 
the center and get shit done.

4824
03:05:50,440 --> 03:05:51,850
Otherwise,
I don't know where we're heading,

4825
03:05:51,851 --> 03:05:52,920
but anyway,
that's,

4826
03:05:52,950 --> 03:05:56,440
that's my last little bit,
but this has been a great experience.

4827
03:05:56,441 --> 03:05:58,140
Loved the show and,
uh,

4828
03:05:58,150 --> 03:05:58,983
really appreciate it.
I'm going to check with you about my 

4829
03:06:00,251 --> 03:06:01,550
middle boys martial arts.

4830
03:06:02,020 --> 03:06:02,800
Yes,
please do.

4831
03:06:02,800 --> 03:06:03,760
Please do.
I'll help you out.

4832
03:06:03,970 --> 03:06:05,110
Thanks brother.
Really appreciate it.

4833
03:06:05,170 --> 03:06:06,220
Thanks.
See you.

4834
03:06:06,221 --> 03:06:08,050
Tomorrow.
We'll be back with the Ian Mccall.

4835
03:06:08,051 --> 03:06:11,110
We're going to preview this weekend's 
UFC and have some fun.

4836
03:06:11,111 --> 03:06:11,944
See that bike?

4837
03:06:19,560 --> 03:06:20,393
Okay.
